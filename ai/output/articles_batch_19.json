    "abstract": "Significance Ca2+ signaling is closely linked to the triggering of plant immune responses. We show that when the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 is used to trigger immune responses in mutants missing tonoplast Ca2+ pumps, it causes disrupted Ca2+ signals that are higher in amplitude than expected from wild-type plants. Relocalization of a Ca2+ pump normally found in the plasma membrane to the tonoplast rescues both the tonoplast pump knockout mutant’s immune-related phenotypes and aberrant Ca2+ signaling dynamics. These observations support the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for the proper maintenance of Ca2+ dynamics in innate immune responses but that any regulatory systems specific to the endogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required to support these signaling events.

Col-0 and aca4-3/11-5 mutant Arabidopsis thaliana seeds [Col-0 ecotype; aca4-3 (Salk_029620.50.70), aca11-5 (SAIL_269_C07.b.1a. Lb3Fa), kindly provided by Jeff Harper, University of Nevada, Reno] were vapor-sterilized using 100 mL of 12% (wt/vol) bleach (Chlorox) and 3 mL of 37% (vol/vol) hydrochloric acid for 3 h. Seeds for confocal imaging were plated on gels of 1/2 Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) basal medium (PhytoTechnology Laboratories) containing 10 mM sucrose and 0.5% (wt/vol) Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 5.7, poured to a 2-mm thickness onto 40 × 24-mm coverslips (Goldseal, ThermoFisher), then stratified at 4 °C for 48 h before being placed in a growth chamber (16-h light/8-h dark at 22 °C or 28 °C). Multiple independently transformed lines expressing 35S::YC-Nano65, UBQ10::ACA8-GFP, UBQ10::ACA8-11Cterm-mGFP5, UBQ10::ACA8-11Cterm-FLAG, UBQ10::ACA8-D482A-11Cterm-mGFP5, or UBQ10::ACA8-D482A-11Cterm-FLAG were obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, as previously described (55). Plants imaged for rosette area were germinated in growth chambers set at 22 °C or 28 °C, 16-h light/8-h dark, then transplanted to soil (Propagation Mix, SunGro Horticulture) 7 to 10 d after germination and watered with deionized water. Images were obtained once a day and rosette areas were calculated using FIJI (56). Membrane Staining. Three- to 5-d-old seedlings were incubated in 1/2 LS liquid media containing 1 µM FM5-95 (ThermoFisher) for 5 min on ice. Seedlings were similarly stained with 2 µM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (ThermoFisher) but were incubated for 30 min in 1/2 LS liquid media containing dye, then washed in 1/2 LS media without dye for 3 h at room temperature prior to imaging. Images were acquired on an LSM 780 inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss) using a 40× Water, NA 0.9 objective. GFP and FM5-95 were excited with 488-nm laser, using a 488 dichroic mirror and emission at 500 to 550 nm for GFP or 600 to 700 nm for FM5-95. Lysotracker Red DND-99 was excited with a 561-nm laser (488/561 dichroic; emission 600 to 650 nm). Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefficients for colocalization were calculated using the PSC Colocalization Plugin in FIJI (57). Ratiometric Ca2+ Imaging. Cotyledons were detached from seedlings grown under sterile conditions on plates, as described above, for 7 to 10 d or for rosette leaves from soil grown plants, 20 d after germination. Detached leaves were placed between a thin layer of 1/2 LS + 10 mM sucrose, 0.5% (wt/vol) Phytagel and a coverslip, adaxial side down, 2 h prior to imaging. A 1-cm × 1-cm well was cut into the gel prior to imaging for the application of solutions. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope with a 5×/0.16 M27 EC Plan-Neofluar or 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective. Excitation of the YC-Nano65 sensor was performed with the 458-nm laser line and emission for cpVenus and CFP were obtained at 525 to 540 nm and 460 to 505 nm, respectively. Whole-leaf imaging was performed as in Lenglet, et al. (58). Briefly, a Nikon stereomicroscope (SMZ-25) equipped with a 1× objective (P2-SHR PLAN APO, Nikon), W-VIEW image-splitting optics (Hamamatsu), and a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu) were used to image 20-d-old rosette leaves of YC-Nano65 expressing plants every 30 s. The cpVenus signal arises from FRET from its CFP partner. As Ca2+ levels rise this FRET signal increases and the CFP emission decreases. Time-series FRET data were normalized via the following equation: ΔR/Ro = (R - Ro)/Ro, where R is the ratio of cpVenus emission (FRET):CFP emission and Ro is the average baseline value of this “FRET ratio” prior to flg22 treatment. FRET ratio data were analyzed using the image calculator tool in FIJI (56) using a region of interest encompassing the entire leaf or cotyledon. Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging for whole rosette leaves was performed with a motorized stereomicroscope equipped with image-splitting optics, as previously described (58). qPCR. The total RNA for all samples was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and any contaminating genomic DNA was degraded with TURBO DNase kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was diluted to 10 ng/μL and first-strand cDNA and qPCR were performed using Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR master mix (New England Biolabs) in a 20-µL reaction. qPCR analysis was performed on a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the UBQ10 (At4G05320) gene from A. thaliana as an internal reference (29). qPCR was performed in a 96-well optical PCR plate (ABgene) using the following parameters: 1 cycle of 10 min at 95 °C,and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 58 °C and 15 s at 65 °C, and 1 cycle of dissociation from 58 to 95 °C with 1 ° temperature increments. The qPCR primers used in this study are presented in SI Appendix, Table S1. ACA8-11Cterm Chimeric Pump Cloning. The AtUBQ10 (636bp upstream ATG) promoter was amplified from A. thaliana gDNA using primers 532/533 (SI Appendix, Table S2) that introduced 5′KpnI/3′NcoI sites for subcloning into pCAMBIA1302. mGFP5-tagged constructs. A C-terminal truncated version of ACA8 (ACA8ΔC) was cloned from cDNA using oligos 525/526 (SI Appendix, Table S2) to generate a 5′XbaI and a 3′ SalI sites for subcloning into UBQ10pro::mGFP5-pCAMBIA1302. UBQ10::ACA8ΔC_1302 was linearized with SalI and gBlock5 (Integrated DNA Technologies) (SI Appendix, Table S2) was introduced using isothermal assembly (NEBuilder HiFi Assembly Kit; New England Biolabs) to produce UBQ10::ACA8-11C-mGFP5-1302. The D482A point mutant was generated by amplifying ACA8-11C in two halves (D482A_1 and D482A_2) with primers 633/634 and 635/636, then recombining into UBQ10pro::mGFP5-pCAMBIA1302 digested with XbaI and SalI via isothermal assembly.FLAG-tagged construct. ACA8-11C sequence was amplified from UBQ10::ACA8-11C_1302 with oligos 571/572 (SI Appendix, Table S2) to add a C-terminal FLAG tag and to produce overlaps for isothermal assembly into UBQ10pro::pCAMBIA1300 digested with XbaI/BamHI. Pathogenesis Assays. Ten-day-old seedlings were flood-inoculated essentially as in Ishiga et al. (59). Seedlings were grown in 12-well plates containing 1/2 LS salts and 0.5% (wt/vol) Phytagel solid media. On the day of infection, Pst DC3000 (pVSP61) inoculum was suspended in sterile water with 0.025% (vol/vol) Silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds) to an OD595nm = 0.01 (∼8.0 × 106 CFU/mL of bacteria) and 3 mL of inoculum was added to each well for 3 min, decanted, and tissue harvested from 5 to 10 seedlings per biological replicate at 1 and 3 DPI. After harvesting, tissue fresh weight was measured, and the samples were surface-sterilized with 5% (vol/vol) H2O2 for 5 min and rinsed three times with sterile water. Tissue was placed in 1.5-mL microfuge tubes and macerated in sterile water for 5 min in a 1600 miniG (Spex SamplePrep) set at 1,000 strokes per minute. Macerated tissue was serially diluted in sterile water and spread onto LB plates containing 25 µM rifampicin. Colonies per plate were counted after incubating at 28 °C for 48 h. Protoplast Isolation. Protoplasts were isolated from 10-d-old seedling shoot tissue essentially as in Zhai et al. (60). Confocal imaging of protoplasts was performed with identical settings as described for mGFP5 and FM5-95. Microsomal Fraction Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis. Microsomal preparations and Western blots were performed as previously described (61). Briefly, 10-d-old seedlings were homogenized in extraction buffer (250 mM Sorbitol, 50 mM Hepes-BTP, 25 mM ascorbic acid, 1 mM DTT, 6 mM EGTA 1.2% [wt/vol] Polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 and Roche cOmplete protease inhibitor mixture [Sigma-Aldrich], pH 7.4). The homogenate was filtered with cheesecloth and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant recovered and then centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min to pellet the microsomal fraction. Microsomes were resuspended in extraction buffer and protein concentration measured with BCA Reagent (ThermoFisher) to ensure equal loading for SDS/PAGE. After transfer of protein to nitrocellulose, blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies for anti-H+-PPase (52) and anti-FLS2 (Agrisera) and then probed with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody and developed via chemiluminescence. Phylogenetic Analysis. Sequence alignment and tree construction was based on either the whole protein sequence or N-terminal amino acid domains of the A. thaliana ACAs with AtECA3 as an outgroup. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed using Mega6 (62) with 1,000 bootstraps and a Poisson model.",
    "results": "Results aca4/11 Leaves Exhibit Elevated Baseline Ca2+ Levels. The aca4/11 tonoplast ACA pump knockout shows an enhanced defense response, but its effects on Ca2+ dynamics are unstudied (14). We therefore monitored cytoplasmic Ca2+ dynamics in aca4/11 plants expressing the ratiometric, genetically encoded, fluorescent protein-based Ca2+ sensor YC-Nano65 (16). As Ca2+ levels increase, the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) signal from YC-Nano65 falls and the FRET signal from the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) partner in the sensor increases. An increasing change in the FRET:CFP ratio (∆R) therefore reflects increasing cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]Cyt). aca4/11 mutants spontaneously form lesions around the time of inflorescence bolting, so we only imaged plants that had not yet developed lesions to mitigate potential imaging artifacts from dead cells. We obtained the mean FRET:CFP ratio values over 3 h for entire rosette leaves of Col-0 and aca4/11 and observed a significant elevation in baseline [Ca2+]Cyt in aca4/11 plants (Fig. 1). Similarly, we tested [Ca2+]Cyt values in intact and detached cotyledons of 10-d-old seedlings and observed a similar pattern of basal [Ca2+]Cyt elevation in aca4/11 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Such a sustained Ca2+ elevation may be associated with lesion formation as the infiltration of leaves with an avirulent strain of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst) has also been reported to elicit sustained Ca2+ elevations that preceded hypersensitive lesion formation (17–19). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Basal Ca2+ levels are elevated in aca4/11 rosette leaves. Rosette leaves from intact 20-d-old soil-grown plants expressing YC-Nano65 were imaged at 22 °C. (A) FRET:CFP values for Col-0 and aca4/11 rosettes were obtained every 30 s over 3 h and averaged over this period of time. FRET:CFP values indicate that baseline Ca2+ levels are significantly elevated in intact aca4/11 leaves when compared to Col-0. (Scale bar, 1 cm.) (B) Mean ratio values [YC-Nano65 FRET(YFP) emission:CFP emission] for entire rosettes leaves were quantified for Col-0 and aca4/11. aca4/11 plants exhibit significantly elevated Ca2+ levels compared to Col-0 (n = 8; Student’s t test, ****P < 0.0001). flg22-Dependent Ca2+ Signals Are Elevated in aca4/11. The formation of spontaneous hypersensitive lesions is a characteristic of lesion-mimic mutants and indicative of a deregulated immune response (20), implying that aca4/11 may be showing a similar disruption in defense signaling. Thus, we decided to test the Ca2+ signaling response to the PAMP flg22 (2, 3, 5, 21) in the aca4/11 background. We first established that 1 μM flg22 elicited a clear Ca2+ increase in Col-0 and was below the saturating concentration for the response (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Using this 1-µM concentration as our treatment, we found that flg22 elicited a larger Ca2+ increase in aca4/11 rosette leaves and cotyledons when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 2, SI Appendix, Fig. S3, and Movies S1–S4), suggesting that tonoplast-localized ACAs are important for the proper efflux of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm during signaling events related to PAMP perception. ACA4 and ACA11 are ubiquitously expressed (22), as is the FLS2 receptor, and so we asked whether Ca2+ signaling in response to flg22 was generically disrupted in the double-mutant background in our experiments to help us focus on where ACA4- and ACA11-dependent events were likely to be most prominent. Therefore, we grew plants under the same conditions where aca4/11 showed differences in the flg22-triggered cotyledon Ca2+ response but assayed responses in the root. SI Appendix, Fig. S4 shows that we could detect both the previously documented flg22-induced inhibition of root growth (23) and flg22-triggered Ca2+ increase at the root tip (24) in wild-type Col-0 seedlings, indicating that seedling roots were indeed flg22-responsive under these conditions. However, neither of these flg22-induced responses were significantly different between aca4/11 and Col-0 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A–C). Furthermore, and unlike the shoot tissue, the baseline [Ca2+]Cyt in aca4/11 root tips was not significantly different to Col-0 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), suggesting a potentially smaller impact on cellular Ca2+ homeostasis of loss of ACA4 and ACA11 function at the root tip than in the shoot of these plants. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab aca4/11 plants exhibit an elevated Ca2+ signal in response to flg22. (A) Time series of 20-d-old rosette leaves showing 1 µM flg22-induced FRET ratio elevation in Col-0 and aca4/11 rosettes. Note the elevated Ca2+ increase in the aca4/11 mutant line. Representative of n ≥ 12 experiments. (Scale bar, 8 mm.) (B) Time-series of response in 7- to 10d-old Col-0 and aca4/11 rosette leaves treated with 1 µM flg22 at time = 0 s. The region of interest used for analysis was the entire rosette leaf including the vasculature. The black dashed line indicates significant differences in FRET values for those time points (two-way ANOVA; Tukey’s honestly significant difference [HSD]; P < 0.05, mean ± SEM, n = 10 replicates for each genotype).It is important to note here that our results do not rule out a regulatory role for ACA4 and ACA11 in root Ca2+ signaling and defense response. For example, flg22 responses in regions outside of the root tip or in plants of different ages or grown under different conditions may be altered in the aca4/11 background. However, these results are consistent with Behera et al. (25), who similarly saw no shift in baseline Ca2+ and little effect on root tip Ca2+ signaling in response to exogenous ATP in aca4/11 roots. Taking these observations together suggested to us that focusing on analyses of shoot rather than root responses should be the most likely to reveal aca4/11-dependent events. Thus, since our results indicated that aca4/11 defense-signaling phenotypes appear prominent in the shoot tissue, where the lesion-mimic phenotype manifests, and are evident in both mature leaves and cotyledons, we decided to concentrate subsequent analyses on these aerial parts of the plant, using the cotyledons as our major organ for assay of Ca2+ responses. The whole-organ imaging we used to capture the responses quantified in Fig. 2 does not resolve individual cells and so inevitably includes some degree of averaging over multiple responding cells. Thus, the aca4/11-related changes in the Ca2+ signal dynamics seen in the aerial organs in response to flg22 described above could reflect: 1) All of the cells being measured showing a similar elevated flg22-triggered rise in Ca2+, or 2) most aca4/11 cells behaving with the wild type-like response but with a subset showing a much bigger response. In order to discriminate between these possibilities for the altered Ca2+ response in the aca4/11 background, we used confocal ratio imaging to follow changes after flg22 addition with single-cell resolution. This approach allowed us to ask how uniform the cellular response was in the aca4/11 plants. Fig. 3 shows that the elevated response appears homogeneous within responding cells (Fig. 3A) and is mirrored in both individual cellular response in different regions across the organ and in the average response of a subregion of the cotyledon (Fig. 3 B and C). These results are consistent with the effect of the aca4/11 lesion leading to a general elevation of Ca2+ response in all cells rather than reflecting novel responses of a subpopulation. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Single-cell calcium imaging of Col-0 and aca4/11 cotyledons in response to flg22. Representative time series (20× objective) data were collected from Col-0 and aca4/11 lines after flg22 treatment at time = 0 s. Images were acquired near the edge of the cotyledon close to the petiole for all samples. (A) Times-series images of cotyledon epidermal cells of Col-0 and aca4/11 after flg22 treatment.

(B) Response of three representative cells taken across the organ each of Col-0 and aca4/11 to flg22 treatment of the cotyledon at 0s. Note all aca4/11 cells exhibit a similar, higher peak elevation in Ca2+ (ΔR/R0) compared to Col-0. (C) Mean Ca2+ response (ΔR/R0) from a 600-μm × 600-μm region of interest near the petiole of the cotyledon showing that the averaged response of this subregion of the leaf also shows the elevated aca4/11 response relative to wild-type, n > 6. Elevated Temperature Suppresses Lesion Formation and flg22-Dependent Ca2+ Signals in aca4/11. Many lesion-mimic mutants exhibit lesion suppression when grown in elevated temperatures (20, 26), likely due to reduced biosynthesis of the phytohormone salicylic acid (27). While aca4/11 plants grown at 22 °C exhibited dwarfism and eventually formed lesions, growth at 28 °C suppressed both of these aca4/11 phenotypes, an effect that became more obvious as the plants grew larger rosettes (Fig. 4A). We also used molecular markers of the flg22 response to characterize how aca4/11 may affect induction of defense pathways. We first characterized that in wild-type, a 30-min time point after flg22 treatment captured the induction of CPB60g, PHI1, ICS1, and FRK1, all components of PTI induction (28, 29). We also confirmed that the basal expression of these genes was not significantly altered in the various genotypes or under the temperature regimes used in the absence of flg22 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Importantly, FRK1 encodes a receptor-like protein kinase that is thought to function in a pathway independent of the flg22-signaling events mediated through the Ca2+-dependent protein kinases CPK4, -5, -6, and -11 (29). Thus, FRK1 provided us with a marker that may operate independently of Ca2+ signal dynamics, and so of aca4/11-related effects. Indeed, we observed that the 30-min flg22-dependent increase in FRK1, PHI1, and ICS1 transcripts were unaltered in the aca4/11 background when compared to wild-type Col-0 plants (Fig. 4B). However, induction of the defense regulator CBP60g and resistance to Pst bacterial challenge (seen as a reduction in extractable colony forming units of bacteria) were both elevated in aca4/11 plants, with the resistance phenotype being most evident over the initial invasion at 1 d postinoculation (1 DPI) (Fig. 4C). As seen for the dwarfing phenotype, suppression of both flg22-induced elevation of defense gene induction and pathogen resistance occurred in aca4/11 at 28 °C (Fig. 4 B and C). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Elevated temperature suppresses lesion formation and flg22-dependent Ca2+ signals in Col-0 and aca4/11. (A) Rosette area measurements of Col-0 and aca4/11 grown at 22 °C or 28 °C for 14 or 25 d postgermination (DPG).

(B) Transcript levels of 10-d-old seedlings treated with 1 µM flg22 for 30 min. Relative fold-change (2−ΔΔCt) were obtained by normalizing to Col-0 at 0 min (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A).

(D) Mean raw FRET:CFP values for Col-0 and aca4/11 2 min prior to addition of flg22 (n ≥ 15; one-way ANOVA; Tukey’s HSD; P < 0.05). (E) Cotyledon ΔR/R0 indicating that Col-0 and aca4/11 grown and imaged at 28 °C exhibit attenuated Ca2+ signals in response to flg22 (n ≥ 15); To aid in comparisons, Col-0 and aca4/11 22 °C data are reproduced from Fig. 2. Dashed line indicates time points in which both Col-0 and aca4/11 grown at 28 °C are significantly different from both Col-0 and aca4/11 grown at 22 °C (two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni HSD; P < 0.05).Since the above aca4/11 phenotypes were suppressed at 28 °C, we sought to determine if elevated temperature could also suppress the disrupted flg22-dependent Ca2+ responses. Growth at 28 °C caused a reduction in the magnitude of this response in both Col-0 and aca4/11, with the degree of aca4/11 response at 28 °C now closely mirroring that of Col-0 at this temperature (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, the FRET:CFP values for aca4/11 were still significantly higher than Col-0 at both 22 °C and 28 °C and Col-0 baseline was higher at 28 °C than 22 °C (Fig. 4D and SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Thus, growth at elevated temperature appeared to raise the basal Ca2+ level in both Col-0 and aca4/11, but also dampened the subsequent flg22-induced Ca2+ increase to the same degree in both backgrounds. One explanation of these altered response kinetics between aca4/11 and Col-0 at altered temperatures would be that the sensitivity of the plants to flg22 had changed through alteration in FLS2 levels, rather than more directly affecting Ca2+ homeostatic and signaling-related mechanisms. However, we did not detect any significant differences in FLS2 protein or FLS2 transcript levels between genotypes or temperature treatments, suggesting that the differences in flg22-dependent Ca2+ signaling is independent of FLS2 receptor levels and likely reflects temperature-related events downstream of receptor activation (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Tonoplast Localization of ACA8 Rescues aca4/11-Associated Phenotypes. It is known that the aca4/11 lesioning phenotype is rescued by expression of either ACA4 or ACA11 in this mutant background (14). Such data provide a clear link between lesioning behavior and these two tonoplast ACAs. The rescue likely works as the native pumps, with all of their regulatory systems, are being reintroduced into the membrane in which they normally operate. Indeed, the ACAs form a multigene family with clades that map to particular organellar membranes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), and thus it seems likely that particular family members are tailored to operate within the lipid milieu and regulatory networks associated with a particular membrane environment. We asked if this idea was true by targeting a nontonoplast ACA to the tonoplast of the aca4/11 double knockout and assessing its ability to rescue the double-knockout phenotypes. We chose to relocalize ACA8, a plasma membrane pump, to the tonoplast due to its significant divergence from ACA4 and ACA11 in its N-terminal autoinhibitory domain. This is the region where much of this family of pump’s regulation has been localized (30–33) and where a large amount of its isoform-dependent amino acid sequence diversity resides (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). In order to relocalize ACA8, we deleted its C-terminal tail and replaced it with the analogous region of ACA11 (thus creating the chimeric ACA8-11C). The C terminus of ACA11 contains two sequences indicative of tonoplast localization, a dileucine (DXXXLL) and a tyrosine (YXXΦ) motif, where X is any amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid (SI Appendix, Fig. S9) (29, 34). Furthermore, we created a version of the ACA8-11C chimeric pump with a point mutation in the P-loop of the core pump region (ACA8-D482A) that converted a conserved aspartate known to be important for pump activity into an alanine, effectively inactivating the pump (35). For both ACA8-11C and its D482A variant we generated versions tagged at the C terminus with mGFP5 (for localization studies). We also made ACA8-11C with a FLAG tag that we used in Ca2+ imaging experiments as the mGFP5 tag interferes with the imaging of the CFP/YFP-based YC-Nano65 Ca2+ sensor probe we have used. All pump variants were driven by the constitutive AtUBQ10 promoter. Fig. 5 shows that both ACA8-11C-mGFP5 and D482A-mGFP5 colocalized with the dye LysoTrackerRed DND-99, known to label the acidic vacuolar lumen and highlight the tonoplast membrane (36–39). We confirmed that DND-99 is a robust tonoplast marker in pavement cells by showing it colocalizes with the tonoplast-localized protein γ-TIP-CFP (40) (Fig. 5). Further analyses throughout the plant indicated that neither ACA8-11C-mGFP5, D482A-mGFP5, nor γ-TIP-CFP colocalized with the plasma membrane marker FM5-95 in, for example, cells of the root differentiation and elongation zone, leaf guard cells, or in shoot-derived protoplasts, suggesting that ACA8-11C-mGFP5 and D482A-mGFP5 were relocalized from the plasma membrane to the tonoplast (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Although such relocalization is likely being driven by the C-terminal di-leucine and tyrosine motifs we had engineered onto this protein, we cannot discount that overexpression alone is driving mistargeting of the chimeric pump. Irrespective of precise retargeting mechanism, our results indicate tonoplast localization of the ACA8-11C and D482A-mGFP5. Fig. 5.

The yellow arrow on each respective merged image indicates the direction of the fluorescent intensity profiles for both FM5-95 and the fluorescent protein of each corresponding genotype. (Scale bars, 5 μm.)ACA8-11C-mGFP5, but not D482A-mGFP5, was able to rescue the growth and lesion phenotype of aca4/11 (Fig. 6A and SI Appendix, Fig. S11), suggesting that ACA8 must retain functional pump capacity to rescue the double-knockout phenotype. Importantly, overexpression of ACA8 at its native location at the plasma membrane did not rescue these phenotypes in the aca4/11 background, indicating that Ca2+ efflux activity specifically at the tonoplast is required for rescue (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). In parallel experiments, UBQ10::ACA8-11C-FLAG was transformed into aca4/11 plants expressing YC-Nano65, revealing that basal Ca2+ levels and flg22-dependent Ca2+ signals were similar to Col-0 and significantly lower than the aca4/11 mutant (Fig. 6C, SI Appendix, Fig. S6, and Movie S5), These results indicated that the relocalized pump had also rescued the Ca2+ phenotype of aca4/11. Interestingly, following the flg22 Ca2+ response over time scales that captured recovery from the initial flg22-induced peak in [Ca2+]cyt indicated that both Col-0 and aca4/11 could restore basal Ca2+ levels at similar time points despite aca4/11 showing an elevated peak Ca2+ amplitude after flg22 treatment (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, expression of ACA8-11C-FLAG in the aca4/11 background restored longer-term recovery kinetics to resemble wild-type. Although there was an apparent trend for setting even lower Ca2+ levels than in wild-type over this recovery period in these ACA8-11C-FLAG lines, this change was not statistically significant.

However, induction of CPB60g and Pst resistance, features that we have previously seen to be altered in aca4/11 (Fig. 6 B and D), were rescued to wild-type–like levels by expressing ACA8-11C-mGFP5, but not D482A-mGFP5 (Fig. 6 B and D). Again, the effects on the defense phenotype of aca4/11 was most evident in the earlier stages of invasion at 1 DPI (Fig. 6D).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Ca2+-based signaling has been closely linked to PTI, with elicitors such as flg22 triggering Ca2+ changes (e.g., refs. 23, 39) that are thought to play prominent roles in downstream signaling events (1, 4–6). In this study we showed that tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps appear to not only be modulators of Ca2+ homeostasis, but play an important role in regulating both response to the PAMP flg22 and in the induction of PTI. Plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps have likewise been linked to PAMP signaling, with for example, ACA8 thought to form a complex with the FLS2 receptor (15). However, knocking out these plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux pumps that would be thought to play roles in limiting and eventually resetting increases in Ca2+ signals, has been reported to actually attenuate PAMP-triggered Ca2+ responses and downstream signaling (15). In addition, although aca8/10 plants show elevated baseline Ca2+, they do not display spontaneous lesion formation (15). Taken together, these observations suggest a potentially complex role for the plasma membrane pumps in signal processing outside of their ability to pump out, and so normally limit, PAMP-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals. In contrast, we found that knockouts in the vacuolar ACAs led to elevated baseline Ca2+ within the cell (Fig. 1), a larger flg22-induced Ca2+ increase (Figs. 2 and 3), and elevated levels of downstream PTI responses (Fig. 4B). These observations are all consistent with these tonoplast pumps contributing to maintenance of low basal Ca2+ levels and playing roles in limiting the magnitude of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals, signals that are themselves important mediators of PTI signaling. A Role for Temperature in Regulating Early PTI Responses. Elevated temperature is known to attenuate defense signaling (27) and as the aca4/11 plants show phenotypes pointing at runaway PTI events (lesion mimicry, elevated defense responses, increased Ca2+ signaling to flg22), we used this treatment to ask if the high-temperature effect suppressed both Ca2+ dynamics and other defense-response phenotypes. Indeed, elevated temperature attenuated the PTI-related Ca2+ dynamics in aca4/11 to wild-type–like characteristics and these changes correlated with rescue of other elevated defense responses, such as defense gene induction and pathogen resistance (Fig. 4 B and C). These higher temperatures affected the attenuation of flg22-dependent Ca2+ signals in both Col-0 and aca4/11 plants (Fig. 4E), suggesting that common temperature-dependent components of the Ca2+ efflux machinery are affected in both genotypes. Although previous studies have indicated that PTI responses, including positive regulation of defense transcripts and MAPK activation, are favored at elevated temperatures (41), our experiments indicate that Ca2+ signaling, a canonic PTI response, is suppressed at elevated temperature, consistent with reports that defense-response systems are compromised at higher temperatures, likely through alterations in salicylic acid-dependent pathways (29). Transporters at the Tonoplast Shape the Calcium Signature. Along with previous work on aca4/11 defense and lesion phenotypes (14), our study indicates that the activity of ACAs at the tonoplast is important for PTI and normal PAMP-dependent Ca2+ signaling. Using a combination of modeling and direct Ca2+ measurements using aequorin-expressing plants, Lenzoni et al. (42) have shown that not only the characteristics of the rising, but also the falling phase of Ca2+ transients are likely to be important for modulating subsequent defense-related gene expression. However, in our experiments, although aca4/11 had a significantly elevated Ca2+ signal in response to flg22 (Figs. 2B and 3 B and C), both Col-0 and aca4/11 reached basal Ca2+ levels at similar time points (Fig. 6C). This observation indicates that ACA4 and ACA11 are likely important for regulating the net influx of Ca2+ during flg22 perception (i.e., the initial rising phase of the signal), while other efflux systems may be involved in the re-establishment of baseline Ca2+. The Ca2+/H+ exchangers of the tonoplast have similarly been shown to operate in PTI, although the complex they form may act as a response element downstream of the initial perception and signaling machinery (43). The Ca2+/H+ exchangers are also known to play roles in abiotic stress responses (44) and indeed, previous work has implied that the tonoplast provides a signaling hub for these classes of response. For example, in the moss Physcomitrella patens, knockout of the tonoplast calcium pump PCA1 resulted in NaCl-dependent Ca2+ transients that were higher in amplitude and of longer duration (45). Thus, it will be of interest to assess whether ACA4 and ACA11 also play roles in abiotic stress-related Ca2+ signaling. We also show that relocalization of a plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, ACA8, to the tonoplast rescued the phenotypes associated with the aca4/11 tonoplast pump knockout. Several studies have indicated that dileucine motifs are involved in the localization of tonoplast membrane proteins (46–48), and so we have capitalized on this machinery to retarget nontonoplast proteins to the tonoplast for functional rescue experiments. Thus, although when we overexpressed native ACA8, it targeted to the plasma membrane (SI Appendix, Fig. S12), expression of this same pump engineered with the C terminus of ACA11 was targeted to the tonoplast, with little indication of a plasma membrane localized fraction (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Relocalization of ACA8 to the tonoplast sometimes led to the formation of “bulb” structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S13), which are believed to be artifacts due to the dimerization of GFP (49). However, as we used mGFP5—a monomeric form of GFP—that should not dimerize, whether these bulbs are bona fide tonoplast structures (50) potentially enriched in ACA8-11C will require future study. ACAs are typified by the presence of a calmodulin-binding N-terminal autoinhibitory domain that restricts pump activity (35, 51–53) and accounts for much of the variability between ACA isoforms (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). The autoinhibitory domain can undergo posttranslational modifications that can potentially modulate the binding capacity of calmodulin or calmodulin-like (CML) proteins. For example, the autoinhibitory domain of ACA8 appears to be regulated by CML36 (32). This region can also be phosphorylated (30, 31), but in general the molecular identities of the modifiers of ACA action remain undefined. Despite the differences between the N-terminal domains of ACA4, ACA11, and ACA8 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), ACA8-11C was still able to functionally rescue the aca4/11 mutant phenotypes. This observation suggests that Ca2+ transport across the tonoplast by an ACA is the critical feature for this signaling system but, at the same time, that it may not require regulatory circuits specifically tailored to Ca2+ pumps normally targeted to this location. The failure of the pump-dead D482A mutant of ACA8-11C to rescue the aca4/11 phenotype reinforces the idea of this essential role for pumping activity. Thus, the proliferation of ACA family pumps through evolutionary time may have been necessitated to specify the localization of pumps to relevant membranes with a divergence event segregating ACAs into plasma membrane and nonplasma membrane localizations. Although specific regulatory events associated with each membrane locale may have evolved, the basic core pumping activity of these transporters appears robust enough to work in varied cellular locations. Similarly, the Ca2+ homeostatic system appears flexible enough to integrate heterologous pumping activity into a system capable of supporting normal Ca2+-based signaling activities. Thus, the Ca2+ signaling system of pumps and channels shows the features of resilience and compensation reminiscent of the scale-free genetic networks that characterize many other cellular regulatory systems (54).",

Copyright notice ID: 7414185 PMID: 32690691 Significance Ca2+ signaling is closely linked to the triggering of plant immune responses. We show that when the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 is used to trigger immune responses in mutants missing tonoplast Ca2+ pumps, it causes disrupted Ca2+ signals that are higher in amplitude than expected from wild-type plants. Relocalization of a Ca2+ pump normally found in the plasma membrane to the tonoplast rescues both the tonoplast pump knockout mutant’s immune-related phenotypes and aberrant Ca2+ signaling dynamics. These observations support the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for the proper maintenance of Ca2+ dynamics in innate immune responses but that any regulatory systems specific to the endogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required to support these signaling events. Keywords: autoinhibited calcium ATPase, calcium, flg22, vacuoleAbstract One of the major events of early plant immune responses is a rapid influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol following pathogen recognition. Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency. Despite the wealth of observations showing that the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 triggers Ca2+ transients, there remain limited data defining the molecular identities of Ca2+ transporters involved in shaping the cellular Ca2+ dynamics during the triggering of the defense response network. However, the autoinhibited Ca2+-ATPase (ACA) pumps that act to expel Ca2+ from the cytosol have been linked to these events, with knockouts in the vacuolar members of this family showing hypersensitive lesion-mimic phenotypes. We have therefore explored how the two tonoplast-localized pumps, ACA4 and ACA11, impact flg22-dependent Ca2+ signaling and related defense responses. The double-knockout aca4/11 exhibited increased basal Ca2+ levels and Ca2+ signals of higher amplitude than wild-type plants. Both the aberrant Ca2+ dynamics and associated defense-related phenotypes could be suppressed by growing the aca4/11 seedlings at elevated temperatures. Relocalization of ACA8 from its normal cellular locale of the plasma membrane to the tonoplast also suppressed the aca4/11 phenotypes but not when a catalytically inactive mutant was used. These observations indicate that regulation of vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration is an integral component of plant immune signaling, but also that the action of tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps does not require specific regulatory elements not found in plasma membrane-localized pumps. Plant pathogens are ubiquitous in the environment and plants have evolved sensory systems to recognize their presence and trigger appropriate defense responses. One of the best characterized of these sensing networks is through plasma membrane localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These PRRs bind pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs): That is, conserved molecular signals of pathogen presence, such as bacterial flagellin or fungal chitin. Upon PAMP-binding, the PRRs trigger an immune response termed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) that can lead to the rapid development of both local and plant-wide defense (systemic acquired resistance) (1). The best-characterized of the PRRs is the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2). This protein acts with a coreceptor, BAK1, and is responsible for recognizing bacterial flagellin (or minimally the flg22 peptide epitope within flagellin) (2, 3) and triggers the signaling systems that lead to PTI. Induction of these local and systemic responses involves the activation of myriad cellular signaling events at sites of pathogen perception, such as protein phosphorylation cascades, production of reactive oxygen species, anion fluxes, and apoplastic alkalization (1, 4–6). One of these major hallmarks of early PTI responses is a rapid influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol immediately after PAMP recognition. The subsequent change in cytosolic Ca2+ level is then thought to play a role in triggering downstream responses (7–9). Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency: Their so-called “calcium signature” (10). Calcium signatures are determined by an interplay between Ca2+ permeable channels, exchangers, and pumps (11). Two cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs 2 and 4) have emerged as likely key players in the Ca2+ influx supporting the flg22-triggered signaling system under nonlimiting soil Ca2+ levels (12). However, other channels are likely also involved as the cngc2/4 double mutant attenuates, but does not abolish, the flg22-induced Ca2+ change. Similarly, although CNGC2 and -4 are thought to mediate Ca2+ influx at the plasma membrane, whether release from internal Ca2+ stores plays a major role in these signaling events remains to be fully characterized. Despite this important role for channels in generating such defense-related Ca2+ signals, building evidence also suggests an important role for Ca2+ efflux pumps in innate immune Ca2+ signaling. In particular, mutants of P2B-type ATPases, or autoinhibited calcium ATPases (ACAs) (13), have been shown to exhibit aberrant patterns of PTI (14, 15). Thus, mutants in the Arabidopsis plasma membrane ACAs, ACA8 and ACA10, show impaired defense and attenuated flg22-induced Ca2+ signals. Conversely, disruption of the tonoplast ACAs, ACA4 and ACA11, renders plants to be constitutively defense responsive, but whether these phenotypes are related to aberrations in Ca2+ signaling remains unknown (14). We report that aca4/11 mutants show elevated basal Ca2+ and an increased Ca2+ signal in response to flg22. Elevated temperature is known to suppress defense-response phenotypes and growth at high temperatures rescued both the altered Ca2+ dynamics and aberrant downstream pathogen responses. Furthermore, we report that the relocalization of a plasma membrane ACA (ACA8) to the tonoplast rescues the aca4/11 phenotype. These observations imply that tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumping is integral to maintaining homeostatic Ca2+ levels and for the initiation of proper PTI responses. However, because the relocalized plasma membrane pump can rescue the tonoplast knockout phenotypes, any regulatory motifs specific to the tonoplast pumps may not be required to support normal Ca2+ signaling in the flg22-triggered response network. Results aca4/11 Leaves Exhibit Elevated Baseline Ca2+ Levels. The aca4/11 tonoplast ACA pump knockout shows an enhanced defense response, but its effects on Ca2+ dynamics are unstudied (14). We therefore monitored cytoplasmic Ca2+ dynamics in aca4/11 plants expressing the ratiometric, genetically encoded, fluorescent protein-based Ca2+ sensor YC-Nano65 (16). As Ca2+ levels increase, the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) signal from YC-Nano65 falls and the FRET signal from the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) partner in the sensor increases. An increasing change in the FRET:CFP ratio (∆R) therefore reflects increasing cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]Cyt). aca4/11 mutants spontaneously form lesions around the time of inflorescence bolting, so we only imaged plants that had not yet developed lesions to mitigate potential imaging artifacts from dead cells. We obtained the mean FRET:CFP ratio values over 3 h for entire rosette leaves of Col-0 and aca4/11 and observed a significant elevation in baseline [Ca2+]Cyt in aca4/11 plants (Fig. 1). Similarly, we tested [Ca2+]Cyt values in intact and detached cotyledons of 10-d-old seedlings and observed a similar pattern of basal [Ca2+]Cyt elevation in aca4/11 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Such a sustained Ca2+ elevation may be associated with lesion formation as the infiltration of leaves with an avirulent strain of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst) has also been reported to elicit sustained Ca2+ elevations that preceded hypersensitive lesion formation (17–19). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Basal Ca2+ levels are elevated in aca4/11 rosette leaves. Rosette leaves from intact 20-d-old soil-grown plants expressing YC-Nano65 were imaged at 22 °C. (A) FRET:CFP values for Col-0 and aca4/11 rosettes were obtained every 30 s over 3 h and averaged over this period of time. FRET:CFP values indicate that baseline Ca2+ levels are significantly elevated in intact aca4/11 leaves when compared to Col-0. (Scale bar, 1 cm.) (B) Mean ratio values [YC-Nano65 FRET(YFP) emission:CFP emission] for entire rosettes leaves were quantified for Col-0 and aca4/11. aca4/11 plants exhibit significantly elevated Ca2+ levels compared to Col-0 (n = 8; Student’s t test, ****P < 0.0001).flg22-Dependent Ca2+ Signals Are Elevated in aca4/11. The formation of spontaneous hypersensitive lesions is a characteristic of lesion-mimic mutants and indicative of a deregulated immune response (20), implying that aca4/11 may be showing a similar disruption in defense signaling. Thus, we decided to test the Ca2+ signaling response to the PAMP flg22 (2, 3, 5, 21) in the aca4/11 background. We first established that 1 μM flg22 elicited a clear Ca2+ increase in Col-0 and was below the saturating concentration for the response (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Using this 1-µM concentration as our treatment, we found that flg22 elicited a larger Ca2+ increase in aca4/11 rosette leaves and cotyledons when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 2, SI Appendix, Fig. S3, and Movies S1–S4), suggesting that tonoplast-localized ACAs are important for the proper efflux of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm during signaling events related to PAMP perception. ACA4 and ACA11 are ubiquitously expressed (22), as is the FLS2 receptor, and so we asked whether Ca2+ signaling in response to flg22 was generically disrupted in the double-mutant background in our experiments to help us focus on where ACA4- and ACA11-dependent events were likely to be most prominent. Therefore, we grew plants under the same conditions where aca4/11 showed differences in the flg22-triggered cotyledon Ca2+ response but assayed responses in the root. SI Appendix, Fig. S4 shows that we could detect both the previously documented flg22-induced inhibition of root growth (23) and flg22-triggered Ca2+ increase at the root tip (24) in wild-type Col-0 seedlings, indicating that seedling roots were indeed flg22-responsive under these conditions. However, neither of these flg22-induced responses were significantly different between aca4/11 and Col-0 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A–C). Furthermore, and unlike the shoot tissue, the baseline [Ca2+]Cyt in aca4/11 root tips was not significantly different to Col-0 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), suggesting a potentially smaller impact on cellular Ca2+ homeostasis of loss of ACA4 and ACA11 function at the root tip than in the shoot of these plants. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab aca4/11 plants exhibit an elevated Ca2+ signal in response to flg22. (A) Time series of 20-d-old rosette leaves showing 1 µM flg22-induced FRET ratio elevation in Col-0 and aca4/11 rosettes. Note the elevated Ca2+ increase in the aca4/11 mutant line. Representative of n ≥ 12 experiments. (Scale bar, 8 mm.) (B) Time-series of response in 7- to 10d-old Col-0 and aca4/11 rosette leaves treated with 1 µM flg22 at time = 0 s. The region of interest used for analysis was the entire rosette leaf including the vasculature. The black dashed line indicates significant differences in FRET values for those time points (two-way ANOVA; Tukey’s honestly significant difference [HSD]; P < 0.05, mean ± SEM, n = 10 replicates for each genotype).It is important to note here that our results do not rule out a regulatory role for ACA4 and ACA11 in root Ca2+ signaling and defense response. For example, flg22 responses in regions outside of the root tip or in plants of different ages or grown under different conditions may be altered in the aca4/11 background. However, these results are consistent with Behera et al. (25), who similarly saw no shift in baseline Ca2+ and little effect on root tip Ca2+ signaling in response to exogenous ATP in aca4/11 roots. Taking these observations together suggested to us that focusing on analyses of shoot rather than root responses should be the most likely to reveal aca4/11-dependent events. Thus, since our results indicated that aca4/11 defense-signaling phenotypes appear prominent in the shoot tissue, where the lesion-mimic phenotype manifests, and are evident in both mature leaves and cotyledons, we decided to concentrate subsequent analyses on these aerial parts of the plant, using the cotyledons as our major organ for assay of Ca2+ responses. The whole-organ imaging we used to capture the responses quantified in Fig. 2 does not resolve individual cells and so inevitably includes some degree of averaging over multiple responding cells. Thus, the aca4/11-related changes in the Ca2+ signal dynamics seen in the aerial organs in response to flg22 described above could reflect: 1) All of the cells being measured showing a similar elevated flg22-triggered rise in Ca2+, or 2) most aca4/11 cells behaving with the wild type-like response but with a subset showing a much bigger response. In order to discriminate between these possibilities for the altered Ca2+ response in the aca4/11 background, we used confocal ratio imaging to follow changes after flg22 addition with single-cell resolution. This approach allowed us to ask how uniform the cellular response was in the aca4/11 plants. Fig. 3 shows that the elevated response appears homogeneous within responding cells (Fig. 3A) and is mirrored in both individual cellular response in different regions across the organ and in the average response of a subregion of the cotyledon (Fig. 3 B and C). These results are consistent with the effect of the aca4/11 lesion leading to a general elevation of Ca2+ response in all cells rather than reflecting novel responses of a subpopulation. Fig. 3.

(C) Mean Ca2+ response (ΔR/R0) from a 600-μm × 600-μm region of interest near the petiole of the cotyledon showing that the averaged response of this subregion of the leaf also shows the elevated aca4/11 response relative to wild-type, n > 6.Elevated Temperature Suppresses Lesion Formation and flg22-Dependent Ca2+ Signals in aca4/11. Many lesion-mimic mutants exhibit lesion suppression when grown in elevated temperatures (20, 26), likely due to reduced biosynthesis of the phytohormone salicylic acid (27). While aca4/11 plants grown at 22 °C exhibited dwarfism and eventually formed lesions, growth at 28 °C suppressed both of these aca4/11 phenotypes, an effect that became more obvious as the plants grew larger rosettes (Fig. 4A). We also used molecular markers of the flg22 response to characterize how aca4/11 may affect induction of defense pathways. We first characterized that in wild-type, a 30-min time point after flg22 treatment captured the induction of CPB60g, PHI1, ICS1, and FRK1, all components of PTI induction (28, 29). We also confirmed that the basal expression of these genes was not significantly altered in the various genotypes or under the temperature regimes used in the absence of flg22 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Importantly, FRK1 encodes a receptor-like protein kinase that is thought to function in a pathway independent of the flg22-signaling events mediated through the Ca2+-dependent protein kinases CPK4, -5, -6, and -11 (29). Thus, FRK1 provided us with a marker that may operate independently of Ca2+ signal dynamics, and so of aca4/11-related effects. Indeed, we observed that the 30-min flg22-dependent increase in FRK1, PHI1, and ICS1 transcripts were unaltered in the aca4/11 background when compared to wild-type Col-0 plants (Fig. 4B). However, induction of the defense regulator CBP60g and resistance to Pst bacterial challenge (seen as a reduction in extractable colony forming units of bacteria) were both elevated in aca4/11 plants, with the resistance phenotype being most evident over the initial invasion at 1 d postinoculation (1 DPI) (Fig. 4C). As seen for the dwarfing phenotype, suppression of both flg22-induced elevation of defense gene induction and pathogen resistance occurred in aca4/11 at 28 °C (Fig. 4 B and C). Fig. 4.

(D) Mean raw FRET:CFP values for Col-0 and aca4/11 2 min prior to addition of flg22 (n ≥ 15; one-way ANOVA; Tukey’s HSD; P < 0.05). (E) Cotyledon ΔR/R0 indicating that Col-0 and aca4/11 grown and imaged at 28 °C exhibit attenuated Ca2+ signals in response to flg22 (n ≥ 15); To aid in comparisons, Col-0 and aca4/11 22 °C data are reproduced from Fig. 2. Dashed line indicates time points in which both Col-0 and aca4/11 grown at 28 °C are significantly different from both Col-0 and aca4/11 grown at 22 °C (two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni HSD; P < 0.05).Since the above aca4/11 phenotypes were suppressed at 28 °C, we sought to determine if elevated temperature could also suppress the disrupted flg22-dependent Ca2+ responses. Growth at 28 °C caused a reduction in the magnitude of this response in both Col-0 and aca4/11, with the degree of aca4/11 response at 28 °C now closely mirroring that of Col-0 at this temperature (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, the FRET:CFP values for aca4/11 were still significantly higher than Col-0 at both 22 °C and 28 °C and Col-0 baseline was higher at 28 °C than 22 °C (Fig. 4D and SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Thus, growth at elevated temperature appeared to raise the basal Ca2+ level in both Col-0 and aca4/11, but also dampened the subsequent flg22-induced Ca2+ increase to the same degree in both backgrounds. One explanation of these altered response kinetics between aca4/11 and Col-0 at altered temperatures would be that the sensitivity of the plants to flg22 had changed through alteration in FLS2 levels, rather than more directly affecting Ca2+ homeostatic and signaling-related mechanisms. However, we did not detect any significant differences in FLS2 protein or FLS2 transcript levels between genotypes or temperature treatments, suggesting that the differences in flg22-dependent Ca2+ signaling is independent of FLS2 receptor levels and likely reflects temperature-related events downstream of receptor activation (SI Appendix, Fig. S7).Tonoplast Localization of ACA8 Rescues aca4/11-Associated Phenotypes. It is known that the aca4/11 lesioning phenotype is rescued by expression of either ACA4 or ACA11 in this mutant background (14). Such data provide a clear link between lesioning behavior and these two tonoplast ACAs. The rescue likely works as the native pumps, with all of their regulatory systems, are being reintroduced into the membrane in which they normally operate. Indeed, the ACAs form a multigene family with clades that map to particular organellar membranes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), and thus it seems likely that particular family members are tailored to operate within the lipid milieu and regulatory networks associated with a particular membrane environment. We asked if this idea was true by targeting a nontonoplast ACA to the tonoplast of the aca4/11 double knockout and assessing its ability to rescue the double-knockout phenotypes. We chose to relocalize ACA8, a plasma membrane pump, to the tonoplast due to its significant divergence from ACA4 and ACA11 in its N-terminal autoinhibitory domain. This is the region where much of this family of pump’s regulation has been localized (30–33) and where a large amount of its isoform-dependent amino acid sequence diversity resides (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). In order to relocalize ACA8, we deleted its C-terminal tail and replaced it with the analogous region of ACA11 (thus creating the chimeric ACA8-11C). The C terminus of ACA11 contains two sequences indicative of tonoplast localization, a dileucine (DXXXLL) and a tyrosine (YXXΦ) motif, where X is any amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid (SI Appendix, Fig. S9) (29, 34). Furthermore, we created a version of the ACA8-11C chimeric pump with a point mutation in the P-loop of the core pump region (ACA8-D482A) that converted a conserved aspartate known to be important for pump activity into an alanine, effectively inactivating the pump (35). For both ACA8-11C and its D482A variant we generated versions tagged at the C terminus with mGFP5 (for localization studies). We also made ACA8-11C with a FLAG tag that we used in Ca2+ imaging experiments as the mGFP5 tag interferes with the imaging of the CFP/YFP-based YC-Nano65 Ca2+ sensor probe we have used. All pump variants were driven by the constitutive AtUBQ10 promoter. Fig. 5 shows that both ACA8-11C-mGFP5 and D482A-mGFP5 colocalized with the dye LysoTrackerRed DND-99, known to label the acidic vacuolar lumen and highlight the tonoplast membrane (36–39). We confirmed that DND-99 is a robust tonoplast marker in pavement cells by showing it colocalizes with the tonoplast-localized protein γ-TIP-CFP (40) (Fig. 5). Further analyses throughout the plant indicated that neither ACA8-11C-mGFP5, D482A-mGFP5, nor γ-TIP-CFP colocalized with the plasma membrane marker FM5-95 in, for example, cells of the root differentiation and elongation zone, leaf guard cells, or in shoot-derived protoplasts, suggesting that ACA8-11C-mGFP5 and D482A-mGFP5 were relocalized from the plasma membrane to the tonoplast (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Although such relocalization is likely being driven by the C-terminal di-leucine and tyrosine motifs we had engineered onto this protein, we cannot discount that overexpression alone is driving mistargeting of the chimeric pump. Irrespective of precise retargeting mechanism, our results indicate tonoplast localization of the ACA8-11C and D482A-mGFP5. Fig. 5.

(B) Confocal images of protoplasts isolated from 10-d-old seedlings expressing either ACA8-11C:GFP, D482A:GFP, or g γ-TIP:CFP and stained with FM5-95. The yellow arrow on each respective merged image indicates the direction of the fluorescent intensity profiles for both FM5-95 and the fluorescent protein of each corresponding genotype. (Scale bars, 5 μm.)ACA8-11C-mGFP5, but not D482A-mGFP5, was able to rescue the growth and lesion phenotype of aca4/11 (Fig. 6A and SI Appendix, Fig. S11), suggesting that ACA8 must retain functional pump capacity to rescue the double-knockout phenotype. Importantly, overexpression of ACA8 at its native location at the plasma membrane did not rescue these phenotypes in the aca4/11 background, indicating that Ca2+ efflux activity specifically at the tonoplast is required for rescue (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). In parallel experiments, UBQ10::ACA8-11C-FLAG was transformed into aca4/11 plants expressing YC-Nano65, revealing that basal Ca2+ levels and flg22-dependent Ca2+ signals were similar to Col-0 and significantly lower than the aca4/11 mutant (Fig. 6C, SI Appendix, Fig. S6, and Movie S5), These results indicated that the relocalized pump had also rescued the Ca2+ phenotype of aca4/11. Interestingly, following the flg22 Ca2+ response over time scales that captured recovery from the initial flg22-induced peak in [Ca2+]cyt indicated that both Col-0 and aca4/11 could restore basal Ca2+ levels at similar time points despite aca4/11 showing an elevated peak Ca2+ amplitude after flg22 treatment (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, expression of ACA8-11C-FLAG in the aca4/11 background restored longer-term recovery kinetics to resemble wild-type. Although there was an apparent trend for setting even lower Ca2+ levels than in wild-type over this recovery period in these ACA8-11C-FLAG lines, this change was not statistically significant.

Columns with different letters are statistically different (one-way ANOVA; Tukey’s HSD; P < 0.05).We also found that the flg22-induction of defense transcripts that we previously noted as not being altered in the aca4/11 background (FRK1, PHI1, and ICS1) (Fig. 6B) was unaffected by expressing either ACA8-11C or D482A in the aca4/11 background (although PHI1 did show a small reduction in levels of induction from ∼12- to ∼10-fold when D482A was expressed, and FRK1 increased from ∼10- to ∼13-fold). However, induction of CPB60g and Pst resistance, features that we have previously seen to be altered in aca4/11 (Fig. 6 B and D), were rescued to wild-type–like levels by expressing ACA8-11C-mGFP5, but not D482A-mGFP5 (Fig. 6 B and D). Again, the effects on the defense phenotype of aca4/11 was most evident in the earlier stages of invasion at 1 DPI (Fig. 6D).Discussion Ca2+-based signaling has been closely linked to PTI, with elicitors such as flg22 triggering Ca2+ changes (e.g., refs. 23, 39) that are thought to play prominent roles in downstream signaling events (1, 4–6). In this study we showed that tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps appear to not only be modulators of Ca2+ homeostasis, but play an important role in regulating both response to the PAMP flg22 and in the induction of PTI. Plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps have likewise been linked to PAMP signaling, with for example, ACA8 thought to form a complex with the FLS2 receptor (15). However, knocking out these plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux pumps that would be thought to play roles in limiting and eventually resetting increases in Ca2+ signals, has been reported to actually attenuate PAMP-triggered Ca2+ responses and downstream signaling (15). In addition, although aca8/10 plants show elevated baseline Ca2+, they do not display spontaneous lesion formation (15). Taken together, these observations suggest a potentially complex role for the plasma membrane pumps in signal processing outside of their ability to pump out, and so normally limit, PAMP-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals. In contrast, we found that knockouts in the vacuolar ACAs led to elevated baseline Ca2+ within the cell (Fig. 1), a larger flg22-induced Ca2+ increase (Figs. 2 and 3), and elevated levels of downstream PTI responses (Fig. 4B). These observations are all consistent with these tonoplast pumps contributing to maintenance of low basal Ca2+ levels and playing roles in limiting the magnitude of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals, signals that are themselves important mediators of PTI signaling. A Role for Temperature in Regulating Early PTI Responses. Elevated temperature is known to attenuate defense signaling (27) and as the aca4/11 plants show phenotypes pointing at runaway PTI events (lesion mimicry, elevated defense responses, increased Ca2+ signaling to flg22), we used this treatment to ask if the high-temperature effect suppressed both Ca2+ dynamics and other defense-response phenotypes. Indeed, elevated temperature attenuated the PTI-related Ca2+ dynamics in aca4/11 to wild-type–like characteristics and these changes correlated with rescue of other elevated defense responses, such as defense gene induction and pathogen resistance (Fig. 4 B and C). These higher temperatures affected the attenuation of flg22-dependent Ca2+ signals in both Col-0 and aca4/11 plants (Fig. 4E), suggesting that common temperature-dependent components of the Ca2+ efflux machinery are affected in both genotypes. Although previous studies have indicated that PTI responses, including positive regulation of defense transcripts and MAPK activation, are favored at elevated temperatures (41), our experiments indicate that Ca2+ signaling, a canonic PTI response, is suppressed at elevated temperature, consistent with reports that defense-response systems are compromised at higher temperatures, likely through alterations in salicylic acid-dependent pathways (29).Transporters at the Tonoplast Shape the Calcium Signature. Along with previous work on aca4/11 defense and lesion phenotypes (14), our study indicates that the activity of ACAs at the tonoplast is important for PTI and normal PAMP-dependent Ca2+ signaling. Using a combination of modeling and direct Ca2+ measurements using aequorin-expressing plants, Lenzoni et al. (42) have shown that not only the characteristics of the rising, but also the falling phase of Ca2+ transients are likely to be important for modulating subsequent defense-related gene expression. However, in our experiments, although aca4/11 had a significantly elevated Ca2+ signal in response to flg22 (Figs. 2B and 3 B and C), both Col-0 and aca4/11 reached basal Ca2+ levels at similar time points (Fig. 6C). This observation indicates that ACA4 and ACA11 are likely important for regulating the net influx of Ca2+ during flg22 perception (i.e., the initial rising phase of the signal), while other efflux systems may be involved in the re-establishment of baseline Ca2+. The Ca2+/H+ exchangers of the tonoplast have similarly been shown to operate in PTI, although the complex they form may act as a response element downstream of the initial perception and signaling machinery (43). The Ca2+/H+ exchangers are also known to play roles in abiotic stress responses (44) and indeed, previous work has implied that the tonoplast provides a signaling hub for these classes of response. For example, in the moss Physcomitrella patens, knockout of the tonoplast calcium pump PCA1 resulted in NaCl-dependent Ca2+ transients that were higher in amplitude and of longer duration (45). Thus, it will be of interest to assess whether ACA4 and ACA11 also play roles in abiotic stress-related Ca2+ signaling. We also show that relocalization of a plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, ACA8, to the tonoplast rescued the phenotypes associated with the aca4/11 tonoplast pump knockout. Several studies have indicated that dileucine motifs are involved in the localization of tonoplast membrane proteins (46–48), and so we have capitalized on this machinery to retarget nontonoplast proteins to the tonoplast for functional rescue experiments. Thus, although when we overexpressed native ACA8, it targeted to the plasma membrane (SI Appendix, Fig. S12), expression of this same pump engineered with the C terminus of ACA11 was targeted to the tonoplast, with little indication of a plasma membrane localized fraction (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Relocalization of ACA8 to the tonoplast sometimes led to the formation of “bulb” structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S13), which are believed to be artifacts due to the dimerization of GFP (49). However, as we used mGFP5—a monomeric form of GFP—that should not dimerize, whether these bulbs are bona fide tonoplast structures (50) potentially enriched in ACA8-11C will require future study. ACAs are typified by the presence of a calmodulin-binding N-terminal autoinhibitory domain that restricts pump activity (35, 51–53) and accounts for much of the variability between ACA isoforms (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). The autoinhibitory domain can undergo posttranslational modifications that can potentially modulate the binding capacity of calmodulin or calmodulin-like (CML) proteins. For example, the autoinhibitory domain of ACA8 appears to be regulated by CML36 (32). This region can also be phosphorylated (30, 31), but in general the molecular identities of the modifiers of ACA action remain undefined. Despite the differences between the N-terminal domains of ACA4, ACA11, and ACA8 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), ACA8-11C was still able to functionally rescue the aca4/11 mutant phenotypes. This observation suggests that Ca2+ transport across the tonoplast by an ACA is the critical feature for this signaling system but, at the same time, that it may not require regulatory circuits specifically tailored to Ca2+ pumps normally targeted to this location. The failure of the pump-dead D482A mutant of ACA8-11C to rescue the aca4/11 phenotype reinforces the idea of this essential role for pumping activity. Thus, the proliferation of ACA family pumps through evolutionary time may have been necessitated to specify the localization of pumps to relevant membranes with a divergence event segregating ACAs into plasma membrane and nonplasma membrane localizations. Although specific regulatory events associated with each membrane locale may have evolved, the basic core pumping activity of these transporters appears robust enough to work in varied cellular locations. Similarly, the Ca2+ homeostatic system appears flexible enough to integrate heterologous pumping activity into a system capable of supporting normal Ca2+-based signaling activities. Thus, the Ca2+ signaling system of pumps and channels shows the features of resilience and compensation reminiscent of the scale-free genetic networks that characterize many other cellular regulatory systems (54).Materials and Methods Plant Material and Growth Conditions. Col-0 and aca4-3/11-5 mutant Arabidopsis thaliana seeds [Col-0 ecotype; aca4-3 (Salk_029620.50.70), aca11-5 (SAIL_269_C07.b.1a. Lb3Fa), kindly provided by Jeff Harper, University of Nevada, Reno] were vapor-sterilized using 100 mL of 12% (wt/vol) bleach (Chlorox) and 3 mL of 37% (vol/vol) hydrochloric acid for 3 h. Seeds for confocal imaging were plated on gels of 1/2 Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) basal medium (PhytoTechnology Laboratories) containing 10 mM sucrose and 0.5% (wt/vol) Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 5.7, poured to a 2-mm thickness onto 40 × 24-mm coverslips (Goldseal, ThermoFisher), then stratified at 4 °C for 48 h before being placed in a growth chamber (16-h light/8-h dark at 22 °C or 28 °C). Multiple independently transformed lines expressing 35S::YC-Nano65, UBQ10::ACA8-GFP, UBQ10::ACA8-11Cterm-mGFP5, UBQ10::ACA8-11Cterm-FLAG, UBQ10::ACA8-D482A-11Cterm-mGFP5, or UBQ10::ACA8-D482A-11Cterm-FLAG were obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, as previously described (55). Plants imaged for rosette area were germinated in growth chambers set at 22 °C or 28 °C, 16-h light/8-h dark, then transplanted to soil (Propagation Mix, SunGro Horticulture) 7 to 10 d after germination and watered with deionized water. Images were obtained once a day and rosette areas were calculated using FIJI (56).Membrane Staining. Three- to 5-d-old seedlings were incubated in 1/2 LS liquid media containing 1 µM FM5-95 (ThermoFisher) for 5 min on ice. Seedlings were similarly stained with 2 µM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (ThermoFisher) but were incubated for 30 min in 1/2 LS liquid media containing dye, then washed in 1/2 LS media without dye for 3 h at room temperature prior to imaging. Images were acquired on an LSM 780 inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss) using a 40× Water, NA 0.9 objective. GFP and FM5-95 were excited with 488-nm laser, using a 488 dichroic mirror and emission at 500 to 550 nm for GFP or 600 to 700 nm for FM5-95. Lysotracker Red DND-99 was excited with a 561-nm laser (488/561 dichroic; emission 600 to 650 nm). Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefficients for colocalization were calculated using the PSC Colocalization Plugin in FIJI (57).Ratiometric Ca2+ Imaging. Cotyledons were detached from seedlings grown under sterile conditions on plates, as described above, for 7 to 10 d or for rosette leaves from soil grown plants, 20 d after germination. Detached leaves were placed between a thin layer of 1/2 LS + 10 mM sucrose, 0.5% (wt/vol) Phytagel and a coverslip, adaxial side down, 2 h prior to imaging. A 1-cm × 1-cm well was cut into the gel prior to imaging for the application of solutions. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope with a 5×/0.16 M27 EC Plan-Neofluar or 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective. Excitation of the YC-Nano65 sensor was performed with the 458-nm laser line and emission for cpVenus and CFP were obtained at 525 to 540 nm and 460 to 505 nm, respectively. Whole-leaf imaging was performed as in Lenglet, et al. (58). Briefly, a Nikon stereomicroscope (SMZ-25) equipped with a 1× objective (P2-SHR PLAN APO, Nikon), W-VIEW image-splitting optics (Hamamatsu), and a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu) were used to image 20-d-old rosette leaves of YC-Nano65 expressing plants every 30 s. The cpVenus signal arises from FRET from its CFP partner. As Ca2+ levels rise this FRET signal increases and the CFP emission decreases. Time-series FRET data were normalized via the following equation: ΔR/Ro = (R - Ro)/Ro, where R is the ratio of cpVenus emission (FRET):CFP emission and Ro is the average baseline value of this “FRET ratio” prior to flg22 treatment. FRET ratio data were analyzed using the image calculator tool in FIJI (56) using a region of interest encompassing the entire leaf or cotyledon. Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging for whole rosette leaves was performed with a motorized stereomicroscope equipped with image-splitting optics, as previously described (58).qPCR. The total RNA for all samples was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and any contaminating genomic DNA was degraded with TURBO DNase kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was diluted to 10 ng/μL and first-strand cDNA and qPCR were performed using Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR master mix (New England Biolabs) in a 20-µL reaction. qPCR analysis was performed on a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the UBQ10 (At4G05320) gene from A. thaliana as an internal reference (29). qPCR was performed in a 96-well optical PCR plate (ABgene) using the following parameters: 1 cycle of 10 min at 95 °C,and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 58 °C and 15 s at 65 °C, and 1 cycle of dissociation from 58 to 95 °C with 1 ° temperature increments. The qPCR primers used in this study are presented in SI Appendix, Table S1.ACA8-11Cterm Chimeric Pump Cloning. The AtUBQ10 (636bp upstream ATG) promoter was amplified from A. thaliana gDNA using primers 532/533 (SI Appendix, Table S2) that introduced 5′KpnI/3′NcoI sites for subcloning into pCAMBIA1302. mGFP5-tagged constructs. A C-terminal truncated version of ACA8 (ACA8ΔC) was cloned from cDNA using oligos 525/526 (SI Appendix, Table S2) to generate a 5′XbaI and a 3′ SalI sites for subcloning into UBQ10pro::mGFP5-pCAMBIA1302. UBQ10::ACA8ΔC_1302 was linearized with SalI and gBlock5 (Integrated DNA Technologies) (SI Appendix, Table S2) was introduced using isothermal assembly (NEBuilder HiFi Assembly Kit; New England Biolabs) to produce UBQ10::ACA8-11C-mGFP5-1302. The D482A point mutant was generated by amplifying ACA8-11C in two halves (D482A_1 and D482A_2) with primers 633/634 and 635/636, then recombining into UBQ10pro::mGFP5-pCAMBIA1302 digested with XbaI and SalI via isothermal assembly.FLAG-tagged construct. ACA8-11C sequence was amplified from UBQ10::ACA8-11C_1302 with oligos 571/572 (SI Appendix, Table S2) to add a C-terminal FLAG tag and to produce overlaps for isothermal assembly into UBQ10pro::pCAMBIA1300 digested with XbaI/BamHI.Pathogenesis Assays. Ten-day-old seedlings were flood-inoculated essentially as in Ishiga et al. (59). Seedlings were grown in 12-well plates containing 1/2 LS salts and 0.5% (wt/vol) Phytagel solid media. On the day of infection, Pst DC3000 (pVSP61) inoculum was suspended in sterile water with 0.025% (vol/vol) Silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds) to an OD595nm = 0.01 (∼8.0 × 106 CFU/mL of bacteria) and 3 mL of inoculum was added to each well for 3 min, decanted, and tissue harvested from 5 to 10 seedlings per biological replicate at 1 and 3 DPI. After harvesting, tissue fresh weight was measured, and the samples were surface-sterilized with 5% (vol/vol) H2O2 for 5 min and rinsed three times with sterile water. Tissue was placed in 1.5-mL microfuge tubes and macerated in sterile water for 5 min in a 1600 miniG (Spex SamplePrep) set at 1,000 strokes per minute. Macerated tissue was serially diluted in sterile water and spread onto LB plates containing 25 µM rifampicin. Colonies per plate were counted after incubating at 28 °C for 48 h.Protoplast Isolation. Protoplasts were isolated from 10-d-old seedling shoot tissue essentially as in Zhai et al. (60). Confocal imaging of protoplasts was performed with identical settings as described for mGFP5 and FM5-95.Microsomal Fraction Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis. Microsomal preparations and Western blots were performed as previously described (61). Briefly, 10-d-old seedlings were homogenized in extraction buffer (250 mM Sorbitol, 50 mM Hepes-BTP, 25 mM ascorbic acid, 1 mM DTT, 6 mM EGTA 1.2% [wt/vol] Polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 and Roche cOmplete protease inhibitor mixture [Sigma-Aldrich], pH 7.4). The homogenate was filtered with cheesecloth and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant recovered and then centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min to pellet the microsomal fraction. Microsomes were resuspended in extraction buffer and protein concentration measured with BCA Reagent (ThermoFisher) to ensure equal loading for SDS/PAGE. After transfer of protein to nitrocellulose, blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies for anti-H+-PPase (52) and anti-FLS2 (Agrisera) and then probed with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody and developed via chemiluminescence.Phylogenetic Analysis. Sequence alignment and tree construction was based on either the whole protein sequence or N-terminal amino acid domains of the A. thaliana ACAs with AtECA3 as an outgroup. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed using Mega6 (62) with 1,000 bootstraps and a Poisson model.Supplementary Material Supplementary File pnas.2004183117.sapp.pdf (9.1MB, pdf) Supplementary File Download video file (6.8MB, avi) Supplementary File Download video file (5.2MB, avi) Supplementary File Download video file (43.9MB, avi) Supplementary File Download video file (49.4MB, avi) Supplementary File Download video file (38.1MB, avi) Acknowledgments We thank Jeff Harper for the UBQ10::ACA8-GFP construct and aca4/11 seed.

    "abstract": "Abstract Plants possess a systemic signaling system whereby local stimuli can lead to rapid, plant-wide responses. In addition to the redistribution of chemical messengers that range from RNAs and peptides to hormones and metabolites, a communication system acting through the transmission of electrical, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and potentially even hydraulic signals has also been discovered. This latter system can propagate signals across many cells each second and researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries behind this rapid communications network. Thus, elements such as the reactive oxygen species producing NAPDH oxidases and ion channels of the two pore channel, glutamate receptor-like and cyclic nucleotide gated families are all required for the rapid propagation of these signals. Upon arrival at their distant targets, these changes trigger responses ranging from the production of hormones, to changes in the levels of primary metabolites and shifts in patterns of gene expression. These systemic responses occur within seconds to minutes of perception of the initial, local signal, allowing for the rapid deployment of plant-wide responses. For example, an insect starting to chew on just a single leaf triggers preemptive antiherbivore defenses throughout the plant well before it has a chance to move on to the next leaf on its menu.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Plants live in a complex and dynamic environment and thus have evolved systems that monitor multiple stimuli and then integrate this information into an appropriate plant-wide response. To accomplish this feat, plants require signaling systems driven by local stimulus perception and response combined with a communication network to broadcast this information throughout the plant body. In this way, responses to even highly localized stimuli, such as an insect chewing on one leaf, can play out in distant tissues. There are numerous chemical signaling molecules used to perform this systemic signaling ranging from mobile hormones and peptides to metabolites and RNAs. Additionally, evidence for a parallel informational system built around changes in ion fluxes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and electrical signaling has begun to emerge. In this update, we will briefly introduce some recent ideas about the multiple, systemic communication pathways operating over different scales and timeframes within the plant. In particular, for the rapid ionic/ROS/electrical systemic signaling system, key progress has now been made in defining the molecular identities of some of the channels, pumps, and enzymes involved in driving signal propagation. Advances Confirmation of the extensive use of mobile peptide signaling in plants and identification of the protein kinases that act as their receptors adds important new context for understanding plant systemic signaling. Discovery that GLRs and CNGCs act as critical elements of the systemic wound VP/Ca2+ signal provides a key anchor point from which to start building a mechanistic understanding of how systemic signaling is triggered and propagated. Defining the involvement of ROS as a central regulator of systemic signaling highlights a potentially central integrator of systemic responses. Development of technologies to visualize the ROS wave and Ca2+ changes have provided a clearer understanding of the speed and patterning of systemic signaling within the plant. Cell-to-cell and long-range chemical signaling in plants: slow and steady Plants have long been known to integrate their physiology and development through mobile chemical signals. The hormone auxin is a classic example, where the coordinated activity of membrane transporters such as the AUX/LAX, PIN, and ABCBs move auxin in a polar fashion from cell to adjacent cell (Grones and Friml, 2015). The auxin flux then provides both temporal and spatial information to the plant, e.g. driving local patterning within the developing vegetative meristem (Galvan-Ampudia et al., 2020). In addition to hormones, various other regulators are also now known to similarly integrate development and physiology by moving from cell to adjacent cell. For example, in the root, the SHORTROOT protein must move from where it is made in the root xylem, procambium, and xylem-adjacent pericycle to other nearby cells, such as the phloem poles and quiescent center, where it then acts to, e.g. control phloem development (Kim et al., 2020). In addition to such systems providing relatively “local” communication between nearby cells and tissues, there are also a host of mobile signaling molecules that integrate activities over much larger distances within the plant, such as between organs. The polar transport of auxin once again provides an example of one kind of machinery for this long-range exchange of information. Thus, the movement of auxin across many cells within the shoot system allows the apical meristem to integrate its activities with axillary meristems through the process of apical dominance (Barbier et al., 2019), or enables the shoot to communicate with roots about its CO2 environment (Zhou et al., 2019). In other cases, such long-distance communication systems are thought to use the mass flow within the vascular system to support their more rapid transport throughout the plant. Thus, movement of RNA, proteins, peptides, hormones, metabolites, and even nutrients within the xylem or phloem allows one part of the plant to communicate and coordinate its activities with distant organs (reviewed in Ham and Lucas, 2017; Winter and Kragler, 2018). For example, Ca2+ moving up in the transpiration stream may couple stomatal responses in the leaf to Ca2+ supply from the roots (Han et al., 2003). This mobile Ca2+ signal acts through a plastid-based receptor system in the guard cells that itself may further integrate these responses with, e.g. photoacclimation (Cutolo et al., 2019). The potential scope of the vasculature as an information highway for chemical messengers is exemplified by studies on the RNAs found to be mobile in the phloem. In addition to mRNAs, micro RNAs, silencing-induced RNAs, transfer RNAs, and even ribosomal RNAs are also found moving in phloem sap (Kehr and Kragler, 2018), with estimates of approximately 20% of the protein-coding RNAs found to move systemically. The presence of many of these RNAs in the translocation stream may reflect non-specific leakage of companion cell contents into sieve tubes (Calderwood et al., 2016) or remnants from sieve tube differentiation (Knoblauch et al., 2018). Even so, motifs such as transfer RNA-like sequences can tag RNAs for selective transport in the translocation stream (Zhang et al., 2016), and there does appear to be selectivity in the macromolecules found to be moving within the phloem (Garg and Kühn, 2020). Of note in systemic signals moving in the xylem and phloem is the rising profile of mobile peptides as a theme in how plants integrate their activities between organs. Systemin was discovered as the first plant (wound) signaling peptide several decades ago (Pearce et al., 1991), and now small secreted peptides are known to underlie a host of developmental and physiological responses ranging from guard cell differentiation and meristem function to gravitropism (reviewed in Matsubayashi, 2014; Blackburn et al., 2020). This recent characterization of the extent of such mobile peptide signaling by the plant, along with defining the array of plasma membrane receptor-like kinases that underlie many of their perception machineries (reviewed in Chen et al., 2020), represents an important and exciting recent step forward in our understanding of plant systemic signals. For example, an array of peptides released to the vascular system in the root are now known to carry information such as drought (CLAVATA3/ESR-related 25 peptide; Takahashi et al., 2018) or nitrate status (C-terminally encoded peptides; CEPs; Tabata et al., 2014) to the aerial parts of the plant. In the case of nitrogen signaling, CEP DOWNSTREAM peptides (Ohkubo et al., 2017) appear to complete the circuit, carrying information from the shoot to the roots through the phloem. Although CEP and CEP DOWNSTREAM are integral to coordinating plant-wide nitrate responses, plants likely use multiple parallel signals in these long-range communication systems. For example, the plant hormone cytokinin is known to operate alongside these peptide signals in the systemic nitrogen status signaling network (Ruffel et al., 2016; Poitout et al., 2018). Undoubtedly, such chemical exchanges of information between adjacent cells and through the vascular highways explain many key components of the systemic signaling occurring within the plant. However, the speed seen in the plant’s internal communications suggests additional signaling networks must be operating. Auxin moves through the plant at rates of only micrometers per second (Kramer et al., 2011) and small molecules passing through plasmodesmata likely travel at a similar speed (e.g. Rutschow et al., 2011). Although mass transport in the xylem or phloem is much faster, typically in the 200–400 µm/s range (e.g. Peuke et al., 2001; Savage et al., 2013; Knoblauch et al., 2016), systemic signals to, e.g. wounding or high light stress can move at rates in excess of 1,000 µm/s (Table 1 and see below). Systems using self-reinforcing waves of ROS, Ca2+, electrical, and potentially even hydraulic signals are thought to support this much more rapid propagation of systemic information. Table 1. Some examples of the speeds of systemic propagation of signals described in the text Organism Stimulus Signal Speed Number of 50-µm cells/s Reference Venus flytrap Touch AP 54–115 mm/s 1,080–2,300 (Sibaoka, 1966) M. pudica (rachilla) Touch AP 3–7 mm/s 60–140 (Sibaoka, 1966) M. pudica (petiole) Touch AP 6–44 mm/s 120–880 (Sibaoka, 1966) M. pudica (petiole) Wound VP 1–4 mm/s 20–80 (Houwink, 1935) Arabidopsis Wound VP vasculature 1–2 mm/s 20–40 (Mousavi et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2018) VP mesophyll 0.4 mm/s 8 (Mousavi et al., 2013) Ca2+ wave vasculature 1–2 mm/s 20–40 (Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018) Ca2+ wave mesophyll 0.4 mm/s 8 (Toyota et al., 2018) ROS wave vasculature ∼1 mm/s 20 (Miller et al., 2009; Lew et al., 2020) ROS wave mesophyll 0.4 mm/s 8 (Lew et al., 2020) Arabidopsis NaCl Ca2+ wave root 0.4 mm/s 8 (Choi et al., 2014) Open in a new tab For context, the speed has also been converted to the number of 50-µm plant cells that the signal would be able to traverse in a single second. Rapid systemic signaling: the need for speed The rapid systemic signaling and response in leaf movements of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) and sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) provide a dramatic illustration of how fast plant systemic signals can travel. The Venus flytrap is a carnivorous plant that traps insects between two modified leaves that are joined at the base by a hinge that allows them to snap together to form a cage. The adaxial surface of each leaf possesses exquisitely sensitive sensory hairs that, when mechanically stimulated, trigger the trap to close (Scherzer et al., 2019). The hairs activate distant motor cells in the hinge region that levers the two halves of the trap together in approximately 100 ms (Forterre et al., 2005). This speed is required by the plant in order to catch fast moving insects, but how is it achieved? A combination of the elastic structure of the lobes of the trap and rapid turgor-driven changes in motor cell volume drive the physical movements of the trap lobes (Forterre et al., 2005), but what mediates the rapid communication from the sensory hair to the motor cells? The signal is electrical, i.e. mechanical stimulation of the sensory hair generates a transient depolarization of the membrane potential (an action potential, AP) in the cells at its base that propagates throughout the leaf at the rate of 54–115 mm/s. It is the arrival of this AP at the lobe that triggers the leaf closure (Sibaoka, 1966). Similarly, the sensitive plant M. pudica folds its leaflets and moves its petioles quickly (∼1 s) in response to a variety of mechanical and other physical stimuli (Hagihara and Toyota, 2020). Again, the movements are driven by a turgor-powered motor, in this case an organ called the pulvinus, and the rapid signaling appears linked to propagating electrical signals. Non-damaging stimuli (e.g. cold shock or touch) generate an AP that transmits through the plant and then induces the leaflets to move upon its arrival at the tertiary pulvinus (Figure 1, A;Sibaoka, 1966). The AP propagates at 3–7 mm/s in the rachilla (the shaft to which the leaflets are attached) and 6–44 mm/s in the petiole at the base of the whole compound leaf structure (Sibaoka, 1966). These electrical signals are likely moving through the sieve tubes and the parenchyma cells in the protoxylem and phloem (Sibaoka, 1962; Samejima and Sibaoka, 1983; Fromm and Eschrich, 1988). By contrast, damaging stimuli (e.g. cutting or burning leaflets) generates both the AP and an additional electrical signal called a variation potential (VP, also known as a slow wave potential; Figure 1, B;Houwink, 1935). The VP appears to be related to the flow of stimulating chemicals in the xylem vessels and propagates at the rate of 1–4 mm/s in the petiole (Houwink, 1935), i.e. more slowly than that of the AP. Moreover, the existence of a non-electrical (possibly hydraulic), even faster signal is also implied (Houwink, 1935; Malone, 1994). Thus, when the entire organ is strongly damaged (e.g. pruning off of a collection of leaflets or pinna), the primary pulvinus and petiole move earlier than the arrival of either the APs or VPs (Houwink, 1935). In addition, when leaflets are extensively damaged by burning, the thickness of distant leaves is almost immediately changed by a signal moving in excess of 15 mm/s (Figure 1, B; Malone, 1994), possibly linked to wound-related pressure changes propagating through the vasculature. Thus, physical damage that breaks the integrity of the xylem is expected to release the tension in these vessels and due to the relatively incompressible nature of water, this pressure change will be almost instantly transmitted through the vasculature. Indeed, such a hydraulic wave has been proposed to mediate wounding events in a range of plants, where it is thought to propagate through the xylem and potentially phloem vessels. The pressure wave may act to either disperse a stimulating chemical from the wounded tissues or directly trigger mechanically responsive signaling systems within the systemic tissues (e.g. Boari and Malone, 1993; Farmer et al., 2014; Evans and Morris, 2017). However, such hydraulic effects are thought likely to move at speeds up to 100,000-fold faster than the observed propagation of wound-induced electrical and Ca2+ signals, making it complex to relate their kinetics to these other systemic signals (Evans and Morris, 2017). The action of hydraulic signals transmitted through the plant vasculature represents a rapid signaling mechanism seemingly well-tailored to plant anatomy. However, definitively showing such a mechanism in action has been, and remains, a significant challenge in experimental design. For excellent discussions of this area, see Evans and Morris (2017) and Farmer et al. (2020). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Rapid signaling and response in Mimosa. A, Non-wounding stimulus (ice, 0 s) causes rapid movement of leaflets driven by turgor changes in the pulvini at their bases. Cold shock generates only an AP (orange arrows) that cannot propagate past the secondary pulvinus at the base of a pinna (20 s), leading to a local response of the stimulated pinna only. B, Damage (flame, 0 s) triggers rapid closing of a leaf. Such damage causes a putative hydraulic wave (blue arrows), a rapidly propagating AP (orange arrows), and a slower moving VP (red arrows). Once these signals arrive at the pulvinus, movements of ions and water cause changes in pulvinar cell volume that in turn causes the leaf to move. Channels, pumps, and systemic signals Just as for the potential hydraulic signal, the electrical signals that appear central to the rapid systemic signaling in Dionaea and Mimosa are thought to play similar roles in fast, long-distance communication within many plants. For example, an insect chewing on a leaf causes both APs and VPs propagating from the damaged leaf toward distal sites in many species (e.g. Mousavi et al., 2013; Salvador-Recatalà et al., 2014). Importantly, being able to study these phenomena in Arabidopsis has allowed the field to begin to define the machineries driving these changes with molecular precision. Plants maintain an approximately −200 mV potential across their plasma membranes, largely through the action of ion channels, pumps, and transporters (Tester, 1990). Propagating changes in this potential, as seen in Mimosa and Dionaea, may act as signals to rapidly carry information throughout many plants. APs are transient depolarization and repolarization events with set amplitude, velocity, and durations that last on the scale of seconds (Figure 2, A; e.g. Favre et al., 2001; Cuin et al., 2018). By contrast, VPs are characterized by variable initial amplitude and a much slower repolarization (sometimes with superimposed spikes similar to APs) that last for minutes (Figure 2, B). VPs also differ from APs in that the shape of their change in potential over time, and their velocity are dependent on the intensity of the triggering stimulus and decrease with distance from the location of their initiation (Fromm and Lautner, 2007; Sukhov et al., 2013; Vodeneev et al., 2016). Thus, VPs have the potential to encode information about the strength and distance of the stimulus that triggered them, whereas APs have the characteristics of an all-or-nothing, rapid, long-range signal. Both VPs and APs reflect the fluxes of ions that cause both depolarization and successive repolarization of the plasma membrane. Therefore, such electrical signaling is intimately related to the regulation of membrane ion channels, pumps, and other transporters. The recent elucidation of the molecular identities of some of these components has proven a key step forward in our understanding how systemic signals may be propagating. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Plant electrical/ionic systemic signaling. A, Change in electrical potential of an AP is characterized by a short depolarization followed by a repolarization. B, Change in electrical potential of a VP is typified by a sharp depolarization and slow repolarization often with AP-like spikes superimposed. The magnitude of the VP diminishes with distance from the originating stimulus. C, Model for possible series of events related to wound-induced VP and Ca2+ wave. Dashed lines represent speculative regulatory activities. Cation channel activation (through ROS and/or ligand binding) triggers Ca2+ influx with contributions from CNGCs and potentially from plasma membrane-localized GLRs. The molecular identity of the proposed ROS-activated Ca2+-permeable plasma membrane channel in this system remains unknown. GLRs on internal membranes, along with TPC1 on the tonoplast, may be operating in an amplification system that reinforces the cytosolic Ca2+ change. When coupled with Cl− efflux and inactivation of H+-ATPases, these events lead to depolarization of the plasma membrane. Ca2+-dependent processes would be likely candidates to coordinate these activities but precise molecular machineries await to be defined. The accompanying rise in apoplastic pH from inhibition of the H+-ATPase further activates putative GLR Ca2+ conductances at the plasma membrane. The resultant cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation should then lead to activation of RBOHs and further apoplastic ROS production, and thus to a feed-forward loop supporting cell-to-cell propagation of the signal. D, Slow influx of ROS into the cytosol via aquaporins could then inactivate TPC1, inhibiting the cytosolic Ca2+ amplifier. Repolarization would then be driven by H+-ATPase reactivation and K+ release, restoring the membrane potential. A reduction in apoplastic pH would inhibit GLR activity, further contributing to the resetting of the system. The glutamate receptor-like channels Whereas it has long been known that fluxes of Ca2+, K+, Cl−, and H+ are all contributing to the production of APs and VPs (Figure 2, C and D; Vodeneev et al., 2016), the specific channels and pumps involved have only just begun to be defined. We currently have perhaps the most detailed model for channel involvement in the systemic wound response in Arabidopsis, where cation channels of the GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) family have been confirmed to be integral to generating VPs. The GLRs are ligand- (amino acid-) gated, non-selective (Na+ and Ca2+ permeable; e.g. Wudick et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2020) cation channels, with 20 isoforms in Arabidopsis. Mutants in GLRs 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.6 disrupt the duration of the wound-related VP in Arabidopsis (Mousavi et al., 2013). The associated systemic cytosolic Ca2+ signal (Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2020), spread by a systemic increase in ROS (Lew et al., 2020; and see below) and electrical signaling in the phloem (Salvador-Recatalà et al., 2014), are also disrupted by mutations in GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 (Figure 3, A), suggesting a role for GLRs in the cation influx during the depolarization phase of the wound-triggered VP. Wound-induced APs and local wound-triggered Ca2+ increases are still generated in the directly damaged leaves in these mutants; however, they fail to propagate throughout the plant (Salvador-Recatalà et al., 2014; Hedrich et al., 2016; Toyota et al., 2018), implying their role in events specifically related to VP propagation. In contrast, GLR3.5 is thought to act to limit the extent of electrical signaling, with mutants in this channel showing much more extensive spread of damage-induced APs (Salvador-Recatalà, 2016). Similarly, GLR3.1 may play a role in determining the extent of the spread of systemic Ca2+ increases across distal leaves (Nguyen et al., 2018). This role for GLRs in systemic signaling does not appear limited to Arabidopsis. For example, a CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutation that prematurely stops translation of the AtGLR 3.6 ortholog in tomato (Solanum-lycopersicum; SlGLR3.5) blocks wound-induced systemic VPs and increases in ROS (Wang et al., 2019). Mutations in eight other Arabidopsis GLRs tested by Mousavi et al. (2013) did not have a significant effect on the dynamics of wound-triggered VPs, suggesting specificity within the GLRs for activities in the systemic electrical signaling system. However, as a note of caution, it takes a double mutant in both GLR3.3 and 3.6 to effectively ablate the wound-induced Ca2+ wave and VP. Therefore, we must await a systematic analysis of the role(s) of the GLRs alone, and in combination, to robustly define how much of the temporal and spatial dynamics of systemic signaling can be explained by the actions of this channel family. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Model for systemic wound signaling in Arabidopsis. A, Local wounding rapidly triggers production of JA in the directly damaged tissues and also in distant tissues. JA signaling then triggers both local and systemic anti-herbivory defenses. Damage at the wound site (putatively signaled by release of glutamate from damaged cells; Toyota et al., 2018) triggers VP propagation and a wave of increased ROS and Ca2+ that moves through the vasculature to distal leaves where it spreads through plasmodesmatal connections to trigger systemic defenses (Toyota et al., 2018). Transmission is dependent on the action of the GLR ion channels and the plasma membrane H+ pump AHA1. B and C, In the systemic leaves, the Ca2+ rise in the nucleus of target cells triggers phosphorylation of the JAV1 transcriptional inhibitor in a calmodulin-dependent manner. This change then targets JAV1 for ubiquitinylation by the JUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and degradation by the 26S proteasome. Loss of JAV1 disrupts the inhibitory complex it forms with WRKY51/JAZ8, relieving transcriptional repression of AOS, which is an enzyme integral to JA biosynthesis. Arabidopsis image: modified from Eric Belfield, Eurekalert.org.GLRs 3.1, 3.3, and 3.6 have been reported in a range of subcellular sites in plants, including the ER, tonoplast, and plasma membrane (e.g. Singh et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2018; Wudick et al., 2018), suggesting a potentially complex interaction of organellar signaling machineries and the plasma membrane ion fluxes behind VPs. These channels are also expressed in different cell types in aerial tissues, with e.g. GLR3.6 (and GLR3.1) being predominantly produced in xylem contact cells (xylem parenchyma cells adjacent to the conducting vessels) and GLR3.3 in the phloem sieve tubes (Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018). One explanation for the observations that mutating both GLR3.3 and 3.6 is required to fully ablate systemic wound signals, even though they are in different cell types, is the presence of a putative electro-osmotic signal that couples hydraulic changes in the xylem and phloem during propagation of the systemic wound signal (Farmer et al., 2020). Alternatively, two independent systemic wound signaling pathways may be operating in the vascular tissues: one in the xylem mediated by GLR3.6 and one in the phloem using GLR3.3, where each is sufficient to trigger a systemic wound response on its own. Other candidate channels in systemic signaling networks In addition to the GLRs, there are a host of other promising candidates for systemic signaling-related channel activities such as the Ca2+ permeable CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNELs (CNGCs). CNGCs are a family of 20 cation channels reported to be found on both the plasma and internal membranes. CNGCs have already been linked to responses to stimuli that are known to trigger systemic signaling, such as heat stress, wounding, or pathogen attack (e.g. Ali et al., 2007; Meena et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019; Jogawat et al., 2020). Indeed, CNGC19 has been shown to be a Ca2+-permeable, plasma membrane- (Meena et al., 2019) and possibly vacuolar-localized (Yuen and Christopher, 2013) channel required for propagation of the systemic wound-induced Ca2+ signal across the wounded leaf (Meena et al., 2019). Thus, mutants in this gene show a failure to efficiently transmit the wound-triggered Ca2+ wave within the damaged leaf, and are also compromised in plant-wide defenses against insect herbivory (Meena et al., 2019). Whether the CNGC family as a whole plays as integral a role in these systemic events as the GLRs appear to do remains to be investigated. K+ channels are also thought to be integral elements of electrical signal propagation (Figure 2, C and D), but again, we have only just scratched the surface as far as analyses of their potential role(s) in systemic signal propagation. Mutants in the ubiquitously expressed GUARD CELL OUTWARD RECTIFYING K+ channel (GORK) do have altered kinetics of membrane depolarization and repolarization and generate altered dynamics of APs (Cuin et al., 2018). By comparison, although mutants in the ubiquitously expressed ARABIDOPSIS K+ TRANSPORTER 2 (AKT2) do not alter AP characteristics, they do reduce the proportion of plants that produce stimulus-evoked APs (Cuin et al., 2018). By contrast, the STELAR OUTWARD RECTIFYING K+ channel (SKOR), a close relative of GORK that is expressed in the vasculature (Garcia-Mata et al., 2010), does not appear to play a role in wound-related VPs (Mousavi et al., 2013). Similar to this limited knowledge of systemic signaling-related cation channels, the channels and transporters moving anions such as Cl− across the plasma membrane during systemic electrical signal propagation (Figure 2, C and D) also remain to be fully explored. Thus, although the anion channels CLC-b (tonoplast; von der Fecht-Bartenbach et al., 2010) and CLC-e (thylakoid; Herdean et al., 2016) do not appear to be involved in wound-induced systemic VPs (Mousavi et al., 2013), the roles of other plant anion channels in systemic signaling are yet to be characterized. H+ pumps H+-ATPases have long been known to be inactivated during the depolarization phase and then reactivated during the repolarization phase of electrical signal propagation (Vodeneev et al., 2016). However, the specific H+-ATPases involved have only recently begun to be defined. In Arabidopsis, there are 12 H+-ATPases (AHAs) with AHA1-5 and -11 showing widespread expression throughout the plant. AHA1 (predominately shoot) and -2 (predominately root) are especially highly expressed (Gaxiola et al., 2007). Mutants in AHA1, -2, and -3 were not originally thought to play roles in wound-induced VPs (Mousavi et al., 2013). However, recent analysis has shown that AHA1 is involved in repolarization of the plasma membrane following a wound-induced VP (Kumari et al., 2019). Additionally, in aha1, the duration of the wound-triggered systemic Ca2+ signal is extended, providing further mechanistic links between the Ca2+ wave, ion fluxes, and VP propagation. The GLRs themselves are regulated by pH (Shao et al., 2020), providing a further link between H+ pumping and Ca2+ signal. Direct wounding is accompanied by cytosolic acidification, suggesting a likely coupled apoplastic alkalinization (Behera et al., 2018) that would be predicted to activate plasma membrane-localized GLRs (Shao et al., 2020). However, precisely how cytosolic and apoplastic pH change as systemic signals propagate and how this might relate to the activity of GLRs potentially acting in organelles as well as at the plasma membrane remains to be defined. aha2 mutants do not show equivalent disruption of the wound VP, suggesting that only specific H+-ATPases may be involved in supporting these kinds of electrical signals (Kumari et al., 2019). The AHAs are known to controlled by a complex network of elements, including interaction with lipids, ions, protein kinases, and regulators such as 14-3-3 proteins (Falhof et al., 2016). Considering its central role in wound VP dynamics, defining how the factors controlling AHA1 activity relate to the generation of VPs could offer important insight into the underlying regulatory networks driving propagation of systemic signals. Thus, there are some tantalizing clues as to how channels and pumps may make contributions to different aspects of systemic signals, such as to their thresholds or dynamics of propagation. However, we must await a much more comprehensive exploration of the role(s) of the large number of candidate channels, pumps, and exchangers to build a picture of the network of elements that are supporting the fluxes of ions that underlie the systemic signaling network. ROS: The great integrator? In addition to Ca2+ waves and electrical signals, plants additionally employ waves of ROS (see Box 1) as part of their systemic signaling apparatus. These waves are likely being maintained through a ROS-induced ROS release machinery (reviewed in Zandalinas and Mittler, 2018). As seen for systemic electrical signals and the Ca2+ wave, the ROS wave can propagate through both vascular and nonvascular tissues, depending on the stimulus (Fichman et al., 2019; Lew et al., 2020). For example, a wound-induced wave of ROS accumulation and response has been seen to move at speeds in excess of 1 mm/s throughout the vasculature in aerial parts of Arabidopsis (Miller et al., 2009; Fichman et al., 2019; Lew et al., 2020), or at ∼400 µm/s in non-vascular tissues of the root (Evans et al., 2016) and leaves (Lew et al., 2020; see Table 1 and Choi et al. [2016] for summary of propagation speeds). In Arabidopsis, these propagating ROS signals appear dependent on RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOGUE D (RBOHD) and RBOHF (Zandalinas et al., 2020), both plasma membrane, ROS-producing NADPH oxidases known to be central to a range of signaling systems from pathogen defense to drought (Kadota et al., 2015). The ROS wave is detected as both ROS production in the apoplast (Evans et al., 2016; Lew et al., 2020)—as expected for the product of RBOH action—and in the cytoplasm (Miller et al., 2009; Fichman et al., 2019; Zandalinas et al., 2020). The observation of cytoplasmic changes implies either RBOH-derived apoplastic ROS subsequently enter the cell across the plasma membrane, likely through aquaporins (Bienert et al., 2007; Dynowski et al., 2008), or that another, cytoplasmic ROS producing system is also being engaged by the systemic signaling network. Box 1. What are the RBOHs and ROS? The Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs (RBOHs) are a family of NADPH oxidases. Their enzymatic activity is to take an electron from cytosolic NADPH and transfer it across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen to produce the superoxide radical (see Box 1 figure). Superoxide dismutases then act on this highly chemically reactive species to produce the much more stable H2O2 that can be further processed by catalase to produce water and oxygen (Smirnoff and Arnaud, 2019). Superoxide and H2O2 are both forms of ROS, reactive chemical species that contain oxygen. Other ROS include the hydroxyl radical, peroxides, and singlet oxygen. ROS are produced during reactions within the cell and can cause damage to biological macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids due to their highly reactive nature. However, ROS are also used by biology as ubiquitous signaling agents. For example, in Arabidopsis, HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE INDUCED Ca2+ INCREASE 1 (HPCA1) is a plasma membrane leucine-rich receptor kinase that was recently discovered to link H2O2 perception in the apoplast to Ca2+ signaling in the cytoplasm (Wu et al., 2020). The Arabidopsis RBOH family shows regulation by a host of modulators such as a wide range of kinases (including members of the calcium-dependent protein kinase [CDPK] and Calcineurin B-Like/CBL interacting protein kinase [CBL/CIPK] families), small GTPases, and the lipid-based signal phosphatidic acid (e.g. Kadota et al., 2015; Qu et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2020). Of note, the CDPKs, the CBL/CIPKs, and the RBOHs themselves are all directly regulated by Ca2+. Further, the stability of the RBOHD regulating BOTRYTUS INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) is modulated through Ca2+-dependent regulation of CDPK action (Monaghan et al., 2014). Thus, RBOH-based ROS production should be inextricably linked with Ca2+ dynamics. Indeed, mathematical modeling by Evans et al. (2016) supports the idea that it is the interaction of ROS-induced Ca2+ influx at the plasma membrane with the direct and indirect Ca2+ regulation of the RBOHs that sustains cell-to-cell propagation of both the Ca2+ and ROS waves. A direct mechanistic relationship of ROS to the propagating systemic electrical signal remains less clear. In addition to ROS production, RBOHs should alter both apoplastic pH and membrane potential as they move an electron from cytosolic NADPH to the apoplast in order to generate the superoxide radical (see Box 1; Segal, 2016). However, whether the magnitude of these effects is at all significant relative to the activity of channels and pumps driving electrical changes at the plasma membrane is unclear. There are also a number of identified channels and electrophysiologically measured membrane conductances where ROS regulation has either been inferred or directly monitored, including SKOR, GORK, the annexins, TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 (TPC1; see below), and the CNGCs (reviewed in Demidchik, 2018), providing hints at how ROS could modulate electrical signaling phenomena. RBOHD function is known to be required for the systemic propagation of high light- or heat stress-induced VPs (Suzuki et al., 2013); however, a mutant in RBOHD did not alter wound-triggered VP characteristics in Arabidopsis (Mousavi et al., 2013). Nonetheless, a RBOH mutant in tomato does abolish wound-induced, root-to-shoot VP transmission (Wang et al., 2019). Recent experiments driving tissue-specific RBOHD expression in the rbohD knockout background suggests that systemic signaling to local high-light stress requires this enzyme to be located in the xylem parenchyma or phloem (Zandalinas et al., 2020). These are the same tissues where GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 are expressed and are required for systemic wound signaling via VPs and Ca2+ (Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018). Such observations reinforce the idea that plants are likely employing complex and multifaceted propagation mechanisms that may vary from organ to organ or stimulus to stimulus. ROS, RBOHD, and systemic signaling: it’s complicated The RBOHs are multigene families in plants. For example, in Arabidopsis, there are eight other RBOH isoforms in addition to RBOHs D and F. Similarly, although the NADPH oxidases have received the most attention as components of this ROS-based systemic signaling network, ROS dynamics are in reality modulated by a much more complex interplay of ROS producing, degrading, and scavenging processes, including respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport and photorespiration, enzymatic systems involving superoxide dismutases, ascorbate peroxidases, catalases, glutathione peroxidases, and peroxiredoxins, as well as the action of non-enzymatic scavengers such as glutathione, ascorbic acid, and flavonoids (Mittler et al., 2004; Smirnoff and Arnaud, 2019). Further, specific receptors for ROS, such as HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-INCUCED Ca2+ INCREASE 1 (HPCA1) are beginning to be defined (Wu et al., 2020). Dissecting the potential roles of these other ROS-related elements in systemic signaling systems remains an important goal for future research as it offers the possibility to provide some of the missing linkages between Ca2+, ROS, and electrical responses. Propagation of systemic signals also implies a directionality to their transmission and here ROS regulation of tonoplast channels could play a role. Thus, the systemic spread of both the wound- (Kiep et al., 2015) and NaCl- (Choi et al., 2014) driven systemic Ca2+ increases is known to involve the action of a tonoplast channel, TPC1. Activation of RBOHs produces apoplastic ROS that are then expected to trigger ion fluxes (such as Ca2+ influx) at the plasma membrane by gating currently unidentified channels (Demidchik, 2018). TPC1 is then thought to act either directly or indirectly to facilitate Ca2+ release from the vacuole, providing an amplifier for the initial cytosolic Ca2+ increases (Figure 2). The resulting elevated cytosolic Ca2+ could then further trigger RBOH activation, and so cause propagation of the signal from cell to cell (Choi et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2016). TPC1 is inhibited by cytosolic ROS (Pottosin et al., 2009), suggesting a mechanism whereby the initial ROS produced by RBOH activation could enter the cell to inhibit TPC1, leading to a refractory period for the calcium-induced calcium release amplifier. The time delay between activation of the RBOH/TPC1 system and ROS-dependent TPC1 inactivation would then lead to the propagating, wave front-like character to the transmission events. However, although mutants in TPC1 disrupt systemic wound defense responses, local wound-induced Ca2+ increases are not altered (Kiep et al., 2015; Lenglet et al., 2017). In addition, although experimental addition of ROS does trigger Ca2+ increases, the resulting elevated Ca2+ and ROS levels do not propagate systemically (Miller et al., 2009; Evans et al., 2016), suggesting the model described above is likely missing some important elements. For example, TPC1 appears to act in concert with TANDEM PORE K+ Channel 1 (TPK1) and -3 to mediate electrical excitability of the tonoplast (Jaślan et al., 2019). However, TPK1 and -3 are not thought to play roles in wound-induced VP dynamics (Mousavi et al., 2013). Clearly, we are just at the beginning of unraveling the complexities and capabilities of the vacuole as a signaling hub. Systemic responses: what happens at the finish line? Following the propagation of a signal, the response in the distal tissues ranges from the physiological, such as rapid systemic stomatal responses (e.g. Devireddy et al., 2020; Ehonen et al., 2020), alterations in photosynthetic activity (Guo et al., 2016), and leaf movements (Kurenda et al., 2019), to the molecular, with shifts in metabolites (Suzuki et al., 2013; Choudhury et al., 2018), hormone levels (e.g. Glauser et al., 2009; Koo et al., 2009; Toyota et al., 2018), and gene expression levels (Suzuki et al., 2015; Zandalinas et al., 2019). For example, in Arabidopsis, local high-light exposure to a single Arabidopsis leaf triggers a systemic change in metabolites such as glucose, sucrose, and glycine within minutes, and a suite of transcriptional changes within seconds (Suzuki et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2015; Choudhury et al., 2018; Zandalinas et al., 2019). Both these metabolic and transcriptional phenomena are dependent on the action of RBOHD, again suggesting an integral role for ROS in the signaling system. However, precisely where the ROS are operating in the circuitry of signal generation, propagation, and rapid response remains to be fully defined. Wound-induced JA production: integrating Ca2+ and wound signaling responses The response to the arrival of the systemic VP and Ca2+ signal triggered by wounding provides one example of the molecular machinery whereby systemic signaling molecules may be fairly directly turned into the target cell response. In this case, the systemic effect is a rapid (within minutes) increase in the level of the wound hormone jasmonic acid (JA; Glauser et al., 2009; Koo et al., 2009; Toyota et al., 2018). Once the Ca2+ increase arrives at the systemic tissues, it activates the Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein calmodulin, which in turn activates a protein kinase that phosphorylates JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED VQ-MOTIF GENE1 (JAV1; Figure 3, B and C; Yan et al., 2018). JAV1 is part of a repressor complex that along with JAZ8 and WRKY51 inhibits expression of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE (AOS; encoding a key enzyme in JA biosynthesis). The phosphorylation of JAV1 causes this complex to dissociate and triggers JAV1 ubiquitinylation via the E3-ubiquitin ligase JAV1-ASSOCIATED UBIQUITIN LIGASE 1 (JUL1), targeting JAV1 for degradation by the 26S proteasome. The disruption of the inhibitory complex removes repression of AOS transcription and so leads to JA production. There are seven calmodulin genes in Arabidopsis, which encode only four different proteins (CaM1/4, -2/3/5, -6, and -7). In planta JAV1 interacts strongly with CaM1/4 and CaM7, but not with the others (Yan et al., 2018). CaM7 differs from CaM6 and CaM2/3/5 by a single, but different, amino acid, suggesting an exquisitely tailored protein–protein interaction underlies response to the arrival of the systemic Ca2+ signal in this system. Further, as discussed above, CNGC19 plays a role in propagating the wound-induced Ca2+ wave. This channel is also thought to be regulated by CaM, but in this case the CaM2 isoform (Meena et al., 2019). Thus, different CaMs appear to be allowing the plant to both respond to the propagating Ca2+ signal by supporting its transmission and also to translate this same Ca2+ wave to the triggering of systemic JA-mediated defenses once it arrives at its target.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusion Plants have evolved a complex series of local and systemic signaling systems that allow the integration and coordination of their physiology and development. As early as the 1920s we knew that some of the most rapid of responses, such as the leaflet movements in Mimosa, are associated with electrical changes (Snow, 1923; Houwink, 1935). We are now finding similar kinds of rapid, systemic signaling systems in a wide variety of plants operating in response to stimuli ranging from the leaf wounding caused by insect herbivory to local high-light stress. Although APs and VPs are intimately linked to plasma membrane-related events, reflecting as they do ion movements across this membrane, the important roles of the vacuolar ion channel TPC1 and the potential for GLRs located on intracellular membranes such as the tonoplast and ER in systemic signaling highlight the likely role of organelles in propagating these events. Both the ER and the vacuole are emerging as important signaling hubs in plants (Peiter, 2011; Schönknecht, 2013; Liu and Li, 2019) and we can expect that an intricate set of interactions between these organelles and the plasma membrane are going to be important in systemic signal propagation. Defining which channels are acting where, their orientations, and what ion fluxes they support are clearly key pieces of information still needed to understand the mechanisms underlying signal propagation. For example, a plasma membrane locale of the relevant GLRs fits well with the idea of the amino acid glutamate being a trigger for systemic wound responses (Toyota et al., 2018). In this model, cellular damage causes leakage of glutamate to the apoplast that then triggers GLR action and supports the Ca2+ fluxes involved in systemic signal propagation. Consistent with these ideas, in a GLR3.3- and GLR3.6-dependent manner, local application of glutamate can trigger both systemic spread of a Ca2+ increase and activation of JA defense responses throughout the plant (Toyota et al., 2018). How then do GLRs on the organelles play roles in this system? Where do the ligand binding sites face? Are there cytoplasmic amino acid ligands in operation or is some other gating mechanism at play? Despite some major advances in defining molecular mechanisms in the last few years, our models of these systemic signaling events are clearly still far from complete (see Outstanding Questions). Other major open questions are whether or not a simple Ca2+/RBOH feedforward loop is sufficient to explain rapid, systemic signal propagation or whether there are multiple signaling networks tuned to specific stimuli. How central is the vasculature as a highway for these signals and do such systems operate in concert with a rapid hydraulic communication network? We are only just beginning to dissect the molecular underpinnings of this electrical, ROS-based, ionic, and hydraulic systemic signaling system(s), but we do know one thing already, it is fast. Outstanding Questions What are the channels, pumps, co-transport systems, and ion exchangers forming the underlying molecular machineries that generate and propagate AP and VPs involved in systemic signaling? What is the relative role for plasma membrane versus organellar membranes in supporting systemic transmission events and how do they communicate with each other? Wherein lies the specific information in the systemic signal? Are there features of the Ca2+/ROS or electrical signals that encode specific information, or do these changes simply prime systemic tissues for actions that are dictated by other signaling molecules? Do stress-induced hydraulic changes propagating through the vasculature act to carry specific systemic information?",

In addition to the redistribution of chemical messengers that range from RNAs and peptides to hormones and metabolites, a communication system acting through the transmission of electrical, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and potentially even hydraulic signals has also been discovered. This latter system can propagate signals across many cells each second and researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries behind this rapid communications network. Thus, elements such as the reactive oxygen species producing NAPDH oxidases and ion channels of the two pore channel, glutamate receptor-like and cyclic nucleotide gated families are all required for the rapid propagation of these signals. Upon arrival at their distant targets, these changes trigger responses ranging from the production of hormones, to changes in the levels of primary metabolites and shifts in patterns of gene expression. These systemic responses occur within seconds to minutes of perception of the initial, local signal, allowing for the rapid deployment of plant-wide responses. For example, an insect starting to chew on just a single leaf triggers preemptive antiherbivore defenses throughout the plant well before it has a chance to move on to the next leaf on its menu.Introduction Plants live in a complex and dynamic environment and thus have evolved systems that monitor multiple stimuli and then integrate this information into an appropriate plant-wide response. To accomplish this feat, plants require signaling systems driven by local stimulus perception and response combined with a communication network to broadcast this information throughout the plant body. In this way, responses to even highly localized stimuli, such as an insect chewing on one leaf, can play out in distant tissues. There are numerous chemical signaling molecules used to perform this systemic signaling ranging from mobile hormones and peptides to metabolites and RNAs. Additionally, evidence for a parallel informational system built around changes in ion fluxes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and electrical signaling has begun to emerge. In this update, we will briefly introduce some recent ideas about the multiple, systemic communication pathways operating over different scales and timeframes within the plant. In particular, for the rapid ionic/ROS/electrical systemic signaling system, key progress has now been made in defining the molecular identities of some of the channels, pumps, and enzymes involved in driving signal propagation. Advances Confirmation of the extensive use of mobile peptide signaling in plants and identification of the protein kinases that act as their receptors adds important new context for understanding plant systemic signaling. Discovery that GLRs and CNGCs act as critical elements of the systemic wound VP/Ca2+ signal provides a key anchor point from which to start building a mechanistic understanding of how systemic signaling is triggered and propagated. Defining the involvement of ROS as a central regulator of systemic signaling highlights a potentially central integrator of systemic responses. Development of technologies to visualize the ROS wave and Ca2+ changes have provided a clearer understanding of the speed and patterning of systemic signaling within the plant. Cell-to-cell and long-range chemical signaling in plants: slow and steady Plants have long been known to integrate their physiology and development through mobile chemical signals. The hormone auxin is a classic example, where the coordinated activity of membrane transporters such as the AUX/LAX, PIN, and ABCBs move auxin in a polar fashion from cell to adjacent cell (Grones and Friml, 2015). The auxin flux then provides both temporal and spatial information to the plant, e.g. driving local patterning within the developing vegetative meristem (Galvan-Ampudia et al., 2020). In addition to hormones, various other regulators are also now known to similarly integrate development and physiology by moving from cell to adjacent cell. For example, in the root, the SHORTROOT protein must move from where it is made in the root xylem, procambium, and xylem-adjacent pericycle to other nearby cells, such as the phloem poles and quiescent center, where it then acts to, e.g. control phloem development (Kim et al., 2020). In addition to such systems providing relatively “local” communication between nearby cells and tissues, there are also a host of mobile signaling molecules that integrate activities over much larger distances within the plant, such as between organs. The polar transport of auxin once again provides an example of one kind of machinery for this long-range exchange of information. Thus, the movement of auxin across many cells within the shoot system allows the apical meristem to integrate its activities with axillary meristems through the process of apical dominance (Barbier et al., 2019), or enables the shoot to communicate with roots about its CO2 environment (Zhou et al., 2019). In other cases, such long-distance communication systems are thought to use the mass flow within the vascular system to support their more rapid transport throughout the plant. Thus, movement of RNA, proteins, peptides, hormones, metabolites, and even nutrients within the xylem or phloem allows one part of the plant to communicate and coordinate its activities with distant organs (reviewed in Ham and Lucas, 2017; Winter and Kragler, 2018). For example, Ca2+ moving up in the transpiration stream may couple stomatal responses in the leaf to Ca2+ supply from the roots (Han et al., 2003). This mobile Ca2+ signal acts through a plastid-based receptor system in the guard cells that itself may further integrate these responses with, e.g. photoacclimation (Cutolo et al., 2019). The potential scope of the vasculature as an information highway for chemical messengers is exemplified by studies on the RNAs found to be mobile in the phloem. In addition to mRNAs, micro RNAs, silencing-induced RNAs, transfer RNAs, and even ribosomal RNAs are also found moving in phloem sap (Kehr and Kragler, 2018), with estimates of approximately 20% of the protein-coding RNAs found to move systemically. The presence of many of these RNAs in the translocation stream may reflect non-specific leakage of companion cell contents into sieve tubes (Calderwood et al., 2016) or remnants from sieve tube differentiation (Knoblauch et al., 2018). Even so, motifs such as transfer RNA-like sequences can tag RNAs for selective transport in the translocation stream (Zhang et al., 2016), and there does appear to be selectivity in the macromolecules found to be moving within the phloem (Garg and Kühn, 2020). Of note in systemic signals moving in the xylem and phloem is the rising profile of mobile peptides as a theme in how plants integrate their activities between organs. Systemin was discovered as the first plant (wound) signaling peptide several decades ago (Pearce et al., 1991), and now small secreted peptides are known to underlie a host of developmental and physiological responses ranging from guard cell differentiation and meristem function to gravitropism (reviewed in Matsubayashi, 2014; Blackburn et al., 2020). This recent characterization of the extent of such mobile peptide signaling by the plant, along with defining the array of plasma membrane receptor-like kinases that underlie many of their perception machineries (reviewed in Chen et al., 2020), represents an important and exciting recent step forward in our understanding of plant systemic signals. For example, an array of peptides released to the vascular system in the root are now known to carry information such as drought (CLAVATA3/ESR-related 25 peptide; Takahashi et al., 2018) or nitrate status (C-terminally encoded peptides; CEPs; Tabata et al., 2014) to the aerial parts of the plant. In the case of nitrogen signaling, CEP DOWNSTREAM peptides (Ohkubo et al., 2017) appear to complete the circuit, carrying information from the shoot to the roots through the phloem. Although CEP and CEP DOWNSTREAM are integral to coordinating plant-wide nitrate responses, plants likely use multiple parallel signals in these long-range communication systems. For example, the plant hormone cytokinin is known to operate alongside these peptide signals in the systemic nitrogen status signaling network (Ruffel et al., 2016; Poitout et al., 2018). Undoubtedly, such chemical exchanges of information between adjacent cells and through the vascular highways explain many key components of the systemic signaling occurring within the plant. However, the speed seen in the plant’s internal communications suggests additional signaling networks must be operating. Auxin moves through the plant at rates of only micrometers per second (Kramer et al., 2011) and small molecules passing through plasmodesmata likely travel at a similar speed (e.g. Rutschow et al., 2011). Although mass transport in the xylem or phloem is much faster, typically in the 200–400 µm/s range (e.g. Peuke et al., 2001; Savage et al., 2013; Knoblauch et al., 2016), systemic signals to, e.g. wounding or high light stress can move at rates in excess of 1,000 µm/s (Table 1 and see below). Systems using self-reinforcing waves of ROS, Ca2+, electrical, and potentially even hydraulic signals are thought to support this much more rapid propagation of systemic information. Table 1. Some examples of the speeds of systemic propagation of signals described in the text Organism Stimulus Signal Speed Number of 50-µm cells/s Reference Venus flytrap Touch AP 54–115 mm/s 1,080–2,300 (Sibaoka, 1966) M. pudica (rachilla) Touch AP 3–7 mm/s 60–140 (Sibaoka, 1966) M. pudica (petiole) Touch AP 6–44 mm/s 120–880 (Sibaoka, 1966) M. pudica (petiole) Wound VP 1–4 mm/s 20–80 (Houwink, 1935) Arabidopsis Wound VP vasculature 1–2 mm/s 20–40 (Mousavi et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2018) VP mesophyll 0.4 mm/s 8 (Mousavi et al., 2013) Ca2+ wave vasculature 1–2 mm/s 20–40 (Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018) Ca2+ wave mesophyll 0.4 mm/s 8 (Toyota et al., 2018) ROS wave vasculature ∼1 mm/s 20 (Miller et al., 2009; Lew et al., 2020) ROS wave mesophyll 0.4 mm/s 8 (Lew et al., 2020) Arabidopsis NaCl Ca2+ wave root 0.4 mm/s 8 (Choi et al., 2014) Open in a new tab For context, the speed has also been converted to the number of 50-µm plant cells that the signal would be able to traverse in a single second.Rapid systemic signaling: the need for speed The rapid systemic signaling and response in leaf movements of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) and sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) provide a dramatic illustration of how fast plant systemic signals can travel. The Venus flytrap is a carnivorous plant that traps insects between two modified leaves that are joined at the base by a hinge that allows them to snap together to form a cage. The adaxial surface of each leaf possesses exquisitely sensitive sensory hairs that, when mechanically stimulated, trigger the trap to close (Scherzer et al., 2019). The hairs activate distant motor cells in the hinge region that levers the two halves of the trap together in approximately 100 ms (Forterre et al., 2005). This speed is required by the plant in order to catch fast moving insects, but how is it achieved? A combination of the elastic structure of the lobes of the trap and rapid turgor-driven changes in motor cell volume drive the physical movements of the trap lobes (Forterre et al., 2005), but what mediates the rapid communication from the sensory hair to the motor cells? The signal is electrical, i.e. mechanical stimulation of the sensory hair generates a transient depolarization of the membrane potential (an action potential, AP) in the cells at its base that propagates throughout the leaf at the rate of 54–115 mm/s. It is the arrival of this AP at the lobe that triggers the leaf closure (Sibaoka, 1966). Similarly, the sensitive plant M. pudica folds its leaflets and moves its petioles quickly (∼1 s) in response to a variety of mechanical and other physical stimuli (Hagihara and Toyota, 2020). Again, the movements are driven by a turgor-powered motor, in this case an organ called the pulvinus, and the rapid signaling appears linked to propagating electrical signals. Non-damaging stimuli (e.g. cold shock or touch) generate an AP that transmits through the plant and then induces the leaflets to move upon its arrival at the tertiary pulvinus (Figure 1, A;Sibaoka, 1966). The AP propagates at 3–7 mm/s in the rachilla (the shaft to which the leaflets are attached) and 6–44 mm/s in the petiole at the base of the whole compound leaf structure (Sibaoka, 1966). These electrical signals are likely moving through the sieve tubes and the parenchyma cells in the protoxylem and phloem (Sibaoka, 1962; Samejima and Sibaoka, 1983; Fromm and Eschrich, 1988). By contrast, damaging stimuli (e.g. cutting or burning leaflets) generates both the AP and an additional electrical signal called a variation potential (VP, also known as a slow wave potential; Figure 1, B;Houwink, 1935). The VP appears to be related to the flow of stimulating chemicals in the xylem vessels and propagates at the rate of 1–4 mm/s in the petiole (Houwink, 1935), i.e. more slowly than that of the AP. Moreover, the existence of a non-electrical (possibly hydraulic), even faster signal is also implied (Houwink, 1935; Malone, 1994). Thus, when the entire organ is strongly damaged (e.g. pruning off of a collection of leaflets or pinna), the primary pulvinus and petiole move earlier than the arrival of either the APs or VPs (Houwink, 1935). In addition, when leaflets are extensively damaged by burning, the thickness of distant leaves is almost immediately changed by a signal moving in excess of 15 mm/s (Figure 1, B; Malone, 1994), possibly linked to wound-related pressure changes propagating through the vasculature. Thus, physical damage that breaks the integrity of the xylem is expected to release the tension in these vessels and due to the relatively incompressible nature of water, this pressure change will be almost instantly transmitted through the vasculature. Indeed, such a hydraulic wave has been proposed to mediate wounding events in a range of plants, where it is thought to propagate through the xylem and potentially phloem vessels. The pressure wave may act to either disperse a stimulating chemical from the wounded tissues or directly trigger mechanically responsive signaling systems within the systemic tissues (e.g. Boari and Malone, 1993; Farmer et al., 2014; Evans and Morris, 2017). However, such hydraulic effects are thought likely to move at speeds up to 100,000-fold faster than the observed propagation of wound-induced electrical and Ca2+ signals, making it complex to relate their kinetics to these other systemic signals (Evans and Morris, 2017). The action of hydraulic signals transmitted through the plant vasculature represents a rapid signaling mechanism seemingly well-tailored to plant anatomy. However, definitively showing such a mechanism in action has been, and remains, a significant challenge in experimental design. For excellent discussions of this area, see Evans and Morris (2017) and Farmer et al. (2020). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Rapid signaling and response in Mimosa. A, Non-wounding stimulus (ice, 0 s) causes rapid movement of leaflets driven by turgor changes in the pulvini at their bases. Cold shock generates only an AP (orange arrows) that cannot propagate past the secondary pulvinus at the base of a pinna (20 s), leading to a local response of the stimulated pinna only. B, Damage (flame, 0 s) triggers rapid closing of a leaf. Such damage causes a putative hydraulic wave (blue arrows), a rapidly propagating AP (orange arrows), and a slower moving VP (red arrows). Once these signals arrive at the pulvinus, movements of ions and water cause changes in pulvinar cell volume that in turn causes the leaf to move.Channels, pumps, and systemic signals Just as for the potential hydraulic signal, the electrical signals that appear central to the rapid systemic signaling in Dionaea and Mimosa are thought to play similar roles in fast, long-distance communication within many plants. For example, an insect chewing on a leaf causes both APs and VPs propagating from the damaged leaf toward distal sites in many species (e.g. Mousavi et al., 2013; Salvador-Recatalà et al., 2014). Importantly, being able to study these phenomena in Arabidopsis has allowed the field to begin to define the machineries driving these changes with molecular precision. Plants maintain an approximately −200 mV potential across their plasma membranes, largely through the action of ion channels, pumps, and transporters (Tester, 1990). Propagating changes in this potential, as seen in Mimosa and Dionaea, may act as signals to rapidly carry information throughout many plants. APs are transient depolarization and repolarization events with set amplitude, velocity, and durations that last on the scale of seconds (Figure 2, A; e.g. Favre et al., 2001; Cuin et al., 2018). By contrast, VPs are characterized by variable initial amplitude and a much slower repolarization (sometimes with superimposed spikes similar to APs) that last for minutes (Figure 2, B). VPs also differ from APs in that the shape of their change in potential over time, and their velocity are dependent on the intensity of the triggering stimulus and decrease with distance from the location of their initiation (Fromm and Lautner, 2007; Sukhov et al., 2013; Vodeneev et al., 2016). Thus, VPs have the potential to encode information about the strength and distance of the stimulus that triggered them, whereas APs have the characteristics of an all-or-nothing, rapid, long-range signal. Both VPs and APs reflect the fluxes of ions that cause both depolarization and successive repolarization of the plasma membrane. Therefore, such electrical signaling is intimately related to the regulation of membrane ion channels, pumps, and other transporters. The recent elucidation of the molecular identities of some of these components has proven a key step forward in our understanding how systemic signals may be propagating. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Plant electrical/ionic systemic signaling. A, Change in electrical potential of an AP is characterized by a short depolarization followed by a repolarization. B, Change in electrical potential of a VP is typified by a sharp depolarization and slow repolarization often with AP-like spikes superimposed. The magnitude of the VP diminishes with distance from the originating stimulus. C, Model for possible series of events related to wound-induced VP and Ca2+ wave. Dashed lines represent speculative regulatory activities. Cation channel activation (through ROS and/or ligand binding) triggers Ca2+ influx with contributions from CNGCs and potentially from plasma membrane-localized GLRs. The molecular identity of the proposed ROS-activated Ca2+-permeable plasma membrane channel in this system remains unknown. GLRs on internal membranes, along with TPC1 on the tonoplast, may be operating in an amplification system that reinforces the cytosolic Ca2+ change. When coupled with Cl− efflux and inactivation of H+-ATPases, these events lead to depolarization of the plasma membrane. Ca2+-dependent processes would be likely candidates to coordinate these activities but precise molecular machineries await to be defined. The accompanying rise in apoplastic pH from inhibition of the H+-ATPase further activates putative GLR Ca2+ conductances at the plasma membrane. The resultant cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation should then lead to activation of RBOHs and further apoplastic ROS production, and thus to a feed-forward loop supporting cell-to-cell propagation of the signal. D, Slow influx of ROS into the cytosol via aquaporins could then inactivate TPC1, inhibiting the cytosolic Ca2+ amplifier. Repolarization would then be driven by H+-ATPase reactivation and K+ release, restoring the membrane potential. A reduction in apoplastic pH would inhibit GLR activity, further contributing to the resetting of the system.The glutamate receptor-like channels Whereas it has long been known that fluxes of Ca2+, K+, Cl−, and H+ are all contributing to the production of APs and VPs (Figure 2, C and D; Vodeneev et al., 2016), the specific channels and pumps involved have only just begun to be defined. We currently have perhaps the most detailed model for channel involvement in the systemic wound response in Arabidopsis, where cation channels of the GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) family have been confirmed to be integral to generating VPs. The GLRs are ligand- (amino acid-) gated, non-selective (Na+ and Ca2+ permeable; e.g. Wudick et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2020) cation channels, with 20 isoforms in Arabidopsis. Mutants in GLRs 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.6 disrupt the duration of the wound-related VP in Arabidopsis (Mousavi et al., 2013). The associated systemic cytosolic Ca2+ signal (Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2020), spread by a systemic increase in ROS (Lew et al., 2020; and see below) and electrical signaling in the phloem (Salvador-Recatalà et al., 2014), are also disrupted by mutations in GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 (Figure 3, A), suggesting a role for GLRs in the cation influx during the depolarization phase of the wound-triggered VP. Wound-induced APs and local wound-triggered Ca2+ increases are still generated in the directly damaged leaves in these mutants; however, they fail to propagate throughout the plant (Salvador-Recatalà et al., 2014; Hedrich et al., 2016; Toyota et al., 2018), implying their role in events specifically related to VP propagation. In contrast, GLR3.5 is thought to act to limit the extent of electrical signaling, with mutants in this channel showing much more extensive spread of damage-induced APs (Salvador-Recatalà, 2016). Similarly, GLR3.1 may play a role in determining the extent of the spread of systemic Ca2+ increases across distal leaves (Nguyen et al., 2018). This role for GLRs in systemic signaling does not appear limited to Arabidopsis. For example, a CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutation that prematurely stops translation of the AtGLR 3.6 ortholog in tomato (Solanum-lycopersicum; SlGLR3.5) blocks wound-induced systemic VPs and increases in ROS (Wang et al., 2019). Mutations in eight other Arabidopsis GLRs tested by Mousavi et al. (2013) did not have a significant effect on the dynamics of wound-triggered VPs, suggesting specificity within the GLRs for activities in the systemic electrical signaling system. However, as a note of caution, it takes a double mutant in both GLR3.3 and 3.6 to effectively ablate the wound-induced Ca2+ wave and VP. Therefore, we must await a systematic analysis of the role(s) of the GLRs alone, and in combination, to robustly define how much of the temporal and spatial dynamics of systemic signaling can be explained by the actions of this channel family. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Model for systemic wound signaling in Arabidopsis. A, Local wounding rapidly triggers production of JA in the directly damaged tissues and also in distant tissues. JA signaling then triggers both local and systemic anti-herbivory defenses. Damage at the wound site (putatively signaled by release of glutamate from damaged cells; Toyota et al., 2018) triggers VP propagation and a wave of increased ROS and Ca2+ that moves through the vasculature to distal leaves where it spreads through plasmodesmatal connections to trigger systemic defenses (Toyota et al., 2018). Transmission is dependent on the action of the GLR ion channels and the plasma membrane H+ pump AHA1. B and C, In the systemic leaves, the Ca2+ rise in the nucleus of target cells triggers phosphorylation of the JAV1 transcriptional inhibitor in a calmodulin-dependent manner. This change then targets JAV1 for ubiquitinylation by the JUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and degradation by the 26S proteasome. Loss of JAV1 disrupts the inhibitory complex it forms with WRKY51/JAZ8, relieving transcriptional repression of AOS, which is an enzyme integral to JA biosynthesis. Arabidopsis image: modified from Eric Belfield, Eurekalert.org.GLRs 3.1, 3.3, and 3.6 have been reported in a range of subcellular sites in plants, including the ER, tonoplast, and plasma membrane (e.g. Singh et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2018; Wudick et al., 2018), suggesting a potentially complex interaction of organellar signaling machineries and the plasma membrane ion fluxes behind VPs. These channels are also expressed in different cell types in aerial tissues, with e.g. GLR3.6 (and GLR3.1) being predominantly produced in xylem contact cells (xylem parenchyma cells adjacent to the conducting vessels) and GLR3.3 in the phloem sieve tubes (Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018). One explanation for the observations that mutating both GLR3.3 and 3.6 is required to fully ablate systemic wound signals, even though they are in different cell types, is the presence of a putative electro-osmotic signal that couples hydraulic changes in the xylem and phloem during propagation of the systemic wound signal (Farmer et al., 2020). Alternatively, two independent systemic wound signaling pathways may be operating in the vascular tissues: one in the xylem mediated by GLR3.6 and one in the phloem using GLR3.3, where each is sufficient to trigger a systemic wound response on its own.Other candidate channels in systemic signaling networks In addition to the GLRs, there are a host of other promising candidates for systemic signaling-related channel activities such as the Ca2+ permeable CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNELs (CNGCs). CNGCs are a family of 20 cation channels reported to be found on both the plasma and internal membranes. CNGCs have already been linked to responses to stimuli that are known to trigger systemic signaling, such as heat stress, wounding, or pathogen attack (e.g. Ali et al., 2007; Meena et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019; Jogawat et al., 2020). Indeed, CNGC19 has been shown to be a Ca2+-permeable, plasma membrane- (Meena et al., 2019) and possibly vacuolar-localized (Yuen and Christopher, 2013) channel required for propagation of the systemic wound-induced Ca2+ signal across the wounded leaf (Meena et al., 2019). Thus, mutants in this gene show a failure to efficiently transmit the wound-triggered Ca2+ wave within the damaged leaf, and are also compromised in plant-wide defenses against insect herbivory (Meena et al., 2019). Whether the CNGC family as a whole plays as integral a role in these systemic events as the GLRs appear to do remains to be investigated. K+ channels are also thought to be integral elements of electrical signal propagation (Figure 2, C and D), but again, we have only just scratched the surface as far as analyses of their potential role(s) in systemic signal propagation. Mutants in the ubiquitously expressed GUARD CELL OUTWARD RECTIFYING K+ channel (GORK) do have altered kinetics of membrane depolarization and repolarization and generate altered dynamics of APs (Cuin et al., 2018). By comparison, although mutants in the ubiquitously expressed ARABIDOPSIS K+ TRANSPORTER 2 (AKT2) do not alter AP characteristics, they do reduce the proportion of plants that produce stimulus-evoked APs (Cuin et al., 2018). By contrast, the STELAR OUTWARD RECTIFYING K+ channel (SKOR), a close relative of GORK that is expressed in the vasculature (Garcia-Mata et al., 2010), does not appear to play a role in wound-related VPs (Mousavi et al., 2013). Similar to this limited knowledge of systemic signaling-related cation channels, the channels and transporters moving anions such as Cl− across the plasma membrane during systemic electrical signal propagation (Figure 2, C and D) also remain to be fully explored. Thus, although the anion channels CLC-b (tonoplast; von der Fecht-Bartenbach et al., 2010) and CLC-e (thylakoid; Herdean et al., 2016) do not appear to be involved in wound-induced systemic VPs (Mousavi et al., 2013), the roles of other plant anion channels in systemic signaling are yet to be characterized.H+ pumps H+-ATPases have long been known to be inactivated during the depolarization phase and then reactivated during the repolarization phase of electrical signal propagation (Vodeneev et al., 2016). However, the specific H+-ATPases involved have only recently begun to be defined. In Arabidopsis, there are 12 H+-ATPases (AHAs) with AHA1-5 and -11 showing widespread expression throughout the plant. AHA1 (predominately shoot) and -2 (predominately root) are especially highly expressed (Gaxiola et al., 2007). Mutants in AHA1, -2, and -3 were not originally thought to play roles in wound-induced VPs (Mousavi et al., 2013). However, recent analysis has shown that AHA1 is involved in repolarization of the plasma membrane following a wound-induced VP (Kumari et al., 2019). Additionally, in aha1, the duration of the wound-triggered systemic Ca2+ signal is extended, providing further mechanistic links between the Ca2+ wave, ion fluxes, and VP propagation. The GLRs themselves are regulated by pH (Shao et al., 2020), providing a further link between H+ pumping and Ca2+ signal. Direct wounding is accompanied by cytosolic acidification, suggesting a likely coupled apoplastic alkalinization (Behera et al., 2018) that would be predicted to activate plasma membrane-localized GLRs (Shao et al., 2020). However, precisely how cytosolic and apoplastic pH change as systemic signals propagate and how this might relate to the activity of GLRs potentially acting in organelles as well as at the plasma membrane remains to be defined. aha2 mutants do not show equivalent disruption of the wound VP, suggesting that only specific H+-ATPases may be involved in supporting these kinds of electrical signals (Kumari et al., 2019). The AHAs are known to controlled by a complex network of elements, including interaction with lipids, ions, protein kinases, and regulators such as 14-3-3 proteins (Falhof et al., 2016). Considering its central role in wound VP dynamics, defining how the factors controlling AHA1 activity relate to the generation of VPs could offer important insight into the underlying regulatory networks driving propagation of systemic signals. Thus, there are some tantalizing clues as to how channels and pumps may make contributions to different aspects of systemic signals, such as to their thresholds or dynamics of propagation. However, we must await a much more comprehensive exploration of the role(s) of the large number of candidate channels, pumps, and exchangers to build a picture of the network of elements that are supporting the fluxes of ions that underlie the systemic signaling network.ROS: The great integrator? In addition to Ca2+ waves and electrical signals, plants additionally employ waves of ROS (see Box 1) as part of their systemic signaling apparatus. These waves are likely being maintained through a ROS-induced ROS release machinery (reviewed in Zandalinas and Mittler, 2018). As seen for systemic electrical signals and the Ca2+ wave, the ROS wave can propagate through both vascular and nonvascular tissues, depending on the stimulus (Fichman et al., 2019; Lew et al., 2020). For example, a wound-induced wave of ROS accumulation and response has been seen to move at speeds in excess of 1 mm/s throughout the vasculature in aerial parts of Arabidopsis (Miller et al., 2009; Fichman et al., 2019; Lew et al., 2020), or at ∼400 µm/s in non-vascular tissues of the root (Evans et al., 2016) and leaves (Lew et al., 2020; see Table 1 and Choi et al. [2016] for summary of propagation speeds). In Arabidopsis, these propagating ROS signals appear dependent on RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOGUE D (RBOHD) and RBOHF (Zandalinas et al., 2020), both plasma membrane, ROS-producing NADPH oxidases known to be central to a range of signaling systems from pathogen defense to drought (Kadota et al., 2015). The ROS wave is detected as both ROS production in the apoplast (Evans et al., 2016; Lew et al., 2020)—as expected for the product of RBOH action—and in the cytoplasm (Miller et al., 2009; Fichman et al., 2019; Zandalinas et al., 2020). The observation of cytoplasmic changes implies either RBOH-derived apoplastic ROS subsequently enter the cell across the plasma membrane, likely through aquaporins (Bienert et al., 2007; Dynowski et al., 2008), or that another, cytoplasmic ROS producing system is also being engaged by the systemic signaling network. Box 1. What are the RBOHs and ROS? The Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs (RBOHs) are a family of NADPH oxidases. Their enzymatic activity is to take an electron from cytosolic NADPH and transfer it across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen to produce the superoxide radical (see Box 1 figure). Superoxide dismutases then act on this highly chemically reactive species to produce the much more stable H2O2 that can be further processed by catalase to produce water and oxygen (Smirnoff and Arnaud, 2019). Superoxide and H2O2 are both forms of ROS, reactive chemical species that contain oxygen. Other ROS include the hydroxyl radical, peroxides, and singlet oxygen. ROS are produced during reactions within the cell and can cause damage to biological macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids due to their highly reactive nature. However, ROS are also used by biology as ubiquitous signaling agents. For example, in Arabidopsis, HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE INDUCED Ca2+ INCREASE 1 (HPCA1) is a plasma membrane leucine-rich receptor kinase that was recently discovered to link H2O2 perception in the apoplast to Ca2+ signaling in the cytoplasm (Wu et al., 2020). The Arabidopsis RBOH family shows regulation by a host of modulators such as a wide range of kinases (including members of the calcium-dependent protein kinase [CDPK] and Calcineurin B-Like/CBL interacting protein kinase [CBL/CIPK] families), small GTPases, and the lipid-based signal phosphatidic acid (e.g. Kadota et al., 2015; Qu et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2020). Of note, the CDPKs, the CBL/CIPKs, and the RBOHs themselves are all directly regulated by Ca2+. Further, the stability of the RBOHD regulating BOTRYTUS INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) is modulated through Ca2+-dependent regulation of CDPK action (Monaghan et al., 2014). Thus, RBOH-based ROS production should be inextricably linked with Ca2+ dynamics. Indeed, mathematical modeling by Evans et al. (2016) supports the idea that it is the interaction of ROS-induced Ca2+ influx at the plasma membrane with the direct and indirect Ca2+ regulation of the RBOHs that sustains cell-to-cell propagation of both the Ca2+ and ROS waves. A direct mechanistic relationship of ROS to the propagating systemic electrical signal remains less clear. In addition to ROS production, RBOHs should alter both apoplastic pH and membrane potential as they move an electron from cytosolic NADPH to the apoplast in order to generate the superoxide radical (see Box 1; Segal, 2016). However, whether the magnitude of these effects is at all significant relative to the activity of channels and pumps driving electrical changes at the plasma membrane is unclear. There are also a number of identified channels and electrophysiologically measured membrane conductances where ROS regulation has either been inferred or directly monitored, including SKOR, GORK, the annexins, TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 (TPC1; see below), and the CNGCs (reviewed in Demidchik, 2018), providing hints at how ROS could modulate electrical signaling phenomena. RBOHD function is known to be required for the systemic propagation of high light- or heat stress-induced VPs (Suzuki et al., 2013); however, a mutant in RBOHD did not alter wound-triggered VP characteristics in Arabidopsis (Mousavi et al., 2013). Nonetheless, a RBOH mutant in tomato does abolish wound-induced, root-to-shoot VP transmission (Wang et al., 2019). Recent experiments driving tissue-specific RBOHD expression in the rbohD knockout background suggests that systemic signaling to local high-light stress requires this enzyme to be located in the xylem parenchyma or phloem (Zandalinas et al., 2020). These are the same tissues where GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 are expressed and are required for systemic wound signaling via VPs and Ca2+ (Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018). Such observations reinforce the idea that plants are likely employing complex and multifaceted propagation mechanisms that may vary from organ to organ or stimulus to stimulus.ROS, RBOHD, and systemic signaling: it’s complicated The RBOHs are multigene families in plants. For example, in Arabidopsis, there are eight other RBOH isoforms in addition to RBOHs D and F. Similarly, although the NADPH oxidases have received the most attention as components of this ROS-based systemic signaling network, ROS dynamics are in reality modulated by a much more complex interplay of ROS producing, degrading, and scavenging processes, including respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport and photorespiration, enzymatic systems involving superoxide dismutases, ascorbate peroxidases, catalases, glutathione peroxidases, and peroxiredoxins, as well as the action of non-enzymatic scavengers such as glutathione, ascorbic acid, and flavonoids (Mittler et al., 2004; Smirnoff and Arnaud, 2019). Further, specific receptors for ROS, such as HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-INCUCED Ca2+ INCREASE 1 (HPCA1) are beginning to be defined (Wu et al., 2020). Dissecting the potential roles of these other ROS-related elements in systemic signaling systems remains an important goal for future research as it offers the possibility to provide some of the missing linkages between Ca2+, ROS, and electrical responses. Propagation of systemic signals also implies a directionality to their transmission and here ROS regulation of tonoplast channels could play a role. Thus, the systemic spread of both the wound- (Kiep et al., 2015) and NaCl- (Choi et al., 2014) driven systemic Ca2+ increases is known to involve the action of a tonoplast channel, TPC1. Activation of RBOHs produces apoplastic ROS that are then expected to trigger ion fluxes (such as Ca2+ influx) at the plasma membrane by gating currently unidentified channels (Demidchik, 2018). TPC1 is then thought to act either directly or indirectly to facilitate Ca2+ release from the vacuole, providing an amplifier for the initial cytosolic Ca2+ increases (Figure 2). The resulting elevated cytosolic Ca2+ could then further trigger RBOH activation, and so cause propagation of the signal from cell to cell (Choi et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2016). TPC1 is inhibited by cytosolic ROS (Pottosin et al., 2009), suggesting a mechanism whereby the initial ROS produced by RBOH activation could enter the cell to inhibit TPC1, leading to a refractory period for the calcium-induced calcium release amplifier. The time delay between activation of the RBOH/TPC1 system and ROS-dependent TPC1 inactivation would then lead to the propagating, wave front-like character to the transmission events. However, although mutants in TPC1 disrupt systemic wound defense responses, local wound-induced Ca2+ increases are not altered (Kiep et al., 2015; Lenglet et al., 2017). In addition, although experimental addition of ROS does trigger Ca2+ increases, the resulting elevated Ca2+ and ROS levels do not propagate systemically (Miller et al., 2009; Evans et al., 2016), suggesting the model described above is likely missing some important elements. For example, TPC1 appears to act in concert with TANDEM PORE K+ Channel 1 (TPK1) and -3 to mediate electrical excitability of the tonoplast (Jaślan et al., 2019). However, TPK1 and -3 are not thought to play roles in wound-induced VP dynamics (Mousavi et al., 2013). Clearly, we are just at the beginning of unraveling the complexities and capabilities of the vacuole as a signaling hub.Systemic responses: what happens at the finish line? Following the propagation of a signal, the response in the distal tissues ranges from the physiological, such as rapid systemic stomatal responses (e.g. Devireddy et al., 2020; Ehonen et al., 2020), alterations in photosynthetic activity (Guo et al., 2016), and leaf movements (Kurenda et al., 2019), to the molecular, with shifts in metabolites (Suzuki et al., 2013; Choudhury et al., 2018), hormone levels (e.g. Glauser et al., 2009; Koo et al., 2009; Toyota et al., 2018), and gene expression levels (Suzuki et al., 2015; Zandalinas et al., 2019). For example, in Arabidopsis, local high-light exposure to a single Arabidopsis leaf triggers a systemic change in metabolites such as glucose, sucrose, and glycine within minutes, and a suite of transcriptional changes within seconds (Suzuki et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2015; Choudhury et al., 2018; Zandalinas et al., 2019). Both these metabolic and transcriptional phenomena are dependent on the action of RBOHD, again suggesting an integral role for ROS in the signaling system. However, precisely where the ROS are operating in the circuitry of signal generation, propagation, and rapid response remains to be fully defined.Wound-induced JA production: integrating Ca2+ and wound signaling responses The response to the arrival of the systemic VP and Ca2+ signal triggered by wounding provides one example of the molecular machinery whereby systemic signaling molecules may be fairly directly turned into the target cell response. In this case, the systemic effect is a rapid (within minutes) increase in the level of the wound hormone jasmonic acid (JA; Glauser et al., 2009; Koo et al., 2009; Toyota et al., 2018). Once the Ca2+ increase arrives at the systemic tissues, it activates the Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein calmodulin, which in turn activates a protein kinase that phosphorylates JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED VQ-MOTIF GENE1 (JAV1; Figure 3, B and C; Yan et al., 2018). JAV1 is part of a repressor complex that along with JAZ8 and WRKY51 inhibits expression of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE (AOS; encoding a key enzyme in JA biosynthesis). The phosphorylation of JAV1 causes this complex to dissociate and triggers JAV1 ubiquitinylation via the E3-ubiquitin ligase JAV1-ASSOCIATED UBIQUITIN LIGASE 1 (JUL1), targeting JAV1 for degradation by the 26S proteasome. The disruption of the inhibitory complex removes repression of AOS transcription and so leads to JA production. There are seven calmodulin genes in Arabidopsis, which encode only four different proteins (CaM1/4, -2/3/5, -6, and -7). In planta JAV1 interacts strongly with CaM1/4 and CaM7, but not with the others (Yan et al., 2018). CaM7 differs from CaM6 and CaM2/3/5 by a single, but different, amino acid, suggesting an exquisitely tailored protein–protein interaction underlies response to the arrival of the systemic Ca2+ signal in this system. Further, as discussed above, CNGC19 plays a role in propagating the wound-induced Ca2+ wave. This channel is also thought to be regulated by CaM, but in this case the CaM2 isoform (Meena et al., 2019). Thus, different CaMs appear to be allowing the plant to both respond to the propagating Ca2+ signal by supporting its transmission and also to translate this same Ca2+ wave to the triggering of systemic JA-mediated defenses once it arrives at its target.Conclusion Plants have evolved a complex series of local and systemic signaling systems that allow the integration and coordination of their physiology and development. As early as the 1920s we knew that some of the most rapid of responses, such as the leaflet movements in Mimosa, are associated with electrical changes (Snow, 1923; Houwink, 1935). We are now finding similar kinds of rapid, systemic signaling systems in a wide variety of plants operating in response to stimuli ranging from the leaf wounding caused by insect herbivory to local high-light stress. Although APs and VPs are intimately linked to plasma membrane-related events, reflecting as they do ion movements across this membrane, the important roles of the vacuolar ion channel TPC1 and the potential for GLRs located on intracellular membranes such as the tonoplast and ER in systemic signaling highlight the likely role of organelles in propagating these events. Both the ER and the vacuole are emerging as important signaling hubs in plants (Peiter, 2011; Schönknecht, 2013; Liu and Li, 2019) and we can expect that an intricate set of interactions between these organelles and the plasma membrane are going to be important in systemic signal propagation. Defining which channels are acting where, their orientations, and what ion fluxes they support are clearly key pieces of information still needed to understand the mechanisms underlying signal propagation. For example, a plasma membrane locale of the relevant GLRs fits well with the idea of the amino acid glutamate being a trigger for systemic wound responses (Toyota et al., 2018). In this model, cellular damage causes leakage of glutamate to the apoplast that then triggers GLR action and supports the Ca2+ fluxes involved in systemic signal propagation. Consistent with these ideas, in a GLR3.3- and GLR3.6-dependent manner, local application of glutamate can trigger both systemic spread of a Ca2+ increase and activation of JA defense responses throughout the plant (Toyota et al., 2018). How then do GLRs on the organelles play roles in this system? Where do the ligand binding sites face? Are there cytoplasmic amino acid ligands in operation or is some other gating mechanism at play? Despite some major advances in defining molecular mechanisms in the last few years, our models of these systemic signaling events are clearly still far from complete (see Outstanding Questions). Other major open questions are whether or not a simple Ca2+/RBOH feedforward loop is sufficient to explain rapid, systemic signal propagation or whether there are multiple signaling networks tuned to specific stimuli. How central is the vasculature as a highway for these signals and do such systems operate in concert with a rapid hydraulic communication network? We are only just beginning to dissect the molecular underpinnings of this electrical, ROS-based, ionic, and hydraulic systemic signaling system(s), but we do know one thing already, it is fast. Outstanding Questions What are the channels, pumps, co-transport systems, and ion exchangers forming the underlying molecular machineries that generate and propagate AP and VPs involved in systemic signaling? What is the relative role for plasma membrane versus organellar membranes in supporting systemic transmission events and how do they communicate with each other? Wherein lies the specific information in the systemic signal? Are there features of the Ca2+/ROS or electrical signals that encode specific information, or do these changes simply prime systemic tissues for actions that are dictated by other signaling molecules? Do stress-induced hydraulic changes propagating through the vasculature act to carry specific systemic information?

    "abstract": "Abstract In addition to microgravity, spaceflight simultaneously exposes biology to a suite of other stimuli. For example, in space, organisms experience ionizing radiation environments that significantly differ in both quality and quantity from those normally experienced on Earth. However, data on radiation exposure during space missions is often complex to access and to understand, limiting progress towards defining how radiation affects organisms against the unique background of spaceflight. To help address this challenge, we have developed the Rad-Bio-App. This web-accessible database imports radiation metadata from experiments archived in NASA’s GeneLab data repository, and then allows the user to explore these experiments both in the context of their radiation exposure and through their other metadata and results. Rad-Bio-App provides an easy-to-use, graphically-driven environment to enable both radiation biologists and non-specialist researchers to visualize, and understand the impact of ionizing radiation on various biological systems in the context of spaceflight. Subject terms: Databases, Physiology, Plant sciences, Microbiology, Molecular biology",
    "introduction": "Introduction The space environment introduces organisms to a unique range of challenges. For example, for humans the closed environment of space vehicles alongside enforced confinement, and the isolation inherent in the vast distances traveled all have important impacts on the functioning of the crew’s physiology and psychology (Fig. 1). Many of these effects are being explored in Earth-based analogs, such as the Hawaii Space Analog and Simulation and the Scientific International Research in Unique Terrestrial Station missions1,2. However, some features of space are complex or impossible to simulate on the Earth’s surface, requiring exploration through the relatively rare opportunity of a spaceflight experiment. For example, exposure to sustained microgravity and to the increased ionizing radiation in space are both beyond the experience of terrestrial biology, and currently almost impossible to mimic on the Earth’s surface. Thus, their individual and combined effects on biology remain poorly understood, yet these are likely to be critical factors in how organisms respond to living in space. Fig. 1. Physical and biological factors affecting human space exploration and their associated stressors including isolation, long confinement in closed environments, microgravity, and ionizing radiation. Open in a new tab These factors are likely to act both alone and in combination to impose effects on the crew in space. A combination of the shielding effects of the atmosphere and the ability of the magnetosphere to deflect radiation around the planet means, that for most of Earth’s history its organisms have been relatively protected from space radiation. Although terrestrial life does encounter natural background radiation from geological sources and UV radiation from the Sun, it is low by comparison to space, with an average annual dose equivalent per person in the US of around 6 mSv3, depending on altitude and soil composition (e.g., the presence of minerals that produce radon gas). In deep space, the radiation exposures will be much higher and include highly ionizing single particles not normally found on Earth. Based on data from the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) during its cruise phase from Earth to Mars and the measurements it made on the Martian surface, the crew on a ~1000 day mission to Mars, assuming “quiet” periods of solar activity throughout, would receive ~360 mGy absorbed dose, much of it from highly ionizing galactic cosmic ray (GCR) ions4,5. This is similar to several decades of absorbed background dose on Earth, but as noted, from a very different spectrum of radiation and delivered at a very different dose rate. All of these factors are likely to play into the precise effects this radiation exposure will have on the crew of such a mission, making it complex to extrapolate from terrestrial models to the spaceflight environment. Indeed, the effects of exposure to space radiation have been shown to induce more deleterious effects in tissues than similar doses of ionizing radiation on Earth, with, e.g., as much as 40 times more biological effectiveness to induce Harderian gland cancers in mice6. However, in addition to inducing cancer, radiation exposure in mammals can lead to a wide array of cellular and microenvironment effects such as chronic inflammation, tissue degeneration and impaired nerve function (e.g., refs. 7,8). Indeed, all organisms are subject to radiation effects, with animals, microbes, and plants experiencing a variety of radiation-induced cellular events ranging from DNA damage and oxidative stress to shifts in metabolism9,10. Different species exhibit varying degrees of radiation tolerance and within a species radiation response is modulated by an individual’s genetics11–14. For example, bacteria in the genus Deinococcus can survive radiation doses far in excess of those that would be lethal in humans15. Predicting such effects are further confounded by the influence of the spaceflight environment, such as living in microgravity, which itself modulates an organism’s radiation response (e.g., refs. 16–18). These complexities in potential biological effects coupled with the relatively limited opportunities to perform direct spaceflight experiments make assessing the risks of radiation exposure to crew members on extended, deep space missions extremely difficult19,20. Yet, as the duration and distances of spaceflight missions increase, the question of how different organisms respond to the effects of increased space radiation exposure and the potential for interactions with, e.g., the microgravity of spaceflight becomes increasingly important to address. To date, much biology-focused spaceflight experimentation has been published without its associated radiation data and though radiation exposure has usually been recorded, it is often not readily accessible. This gap has been recognized by the NASA GeneLab project, which acts as a repository for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from experiments flown in space or exposed to simulated space stressors21–23. Alongside the raw omics datasets, the GeneLab data repository organizes associated metadata into a publicly accessible database called the GeneLab Data System (GLDS21,22). Mining of GeneLab’s omics data then enables exploration of the network of molecular responses to space environments as a function of experimental factors described in the metadata. GeneLab has now aggregated much of the radiation metadata associated with its spaceflight-related datasets24. In other words, the GLDS now provides the raw materials of data and metadata for making broad inferences about radiation effects across multiple sets of spaceflight experiments and in different organisms. The GeneLab Application Programming Interface (API) also enables access to these data by external web applications, with the aim of allowing the scientific community to deploy custom tools to visualize and explore these data in ways complementary to the capabilities available in GeneLab’s own data visualization portal. In the work presented here, we introduce one such custom visualization tool, the Rad-Bio-App (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astro-rad-bio-app). Rad-Bio-App capitalizes on the “FAIRness” standards and rich data curation of the GLDS25 to provide an interactive graphical interface through which investigators can visualize, filter, and compare radiation dosimetry and other metadata across the GLDS. The reiterative filtering capabilities of Rad-Bio-App further allow the user to define datasets with potentially common radiation effects, or to explore interactions between radiation exposure and a variety of space-related experimental conditions. These datasets then provide targets for further in-depth analyses using a variety of bioinformatics-related tools. Overall design and goals of the Rad-Bio-App The overall goal of the Rad-Bio-App is to allow users to develop filtered, curated lists of omics datasets within the GeneLab data repository, that can then be explored for predicted radiation-related responses. Therefore, documenting the origin of such data is of paramount importance and is central to the Rad-Bio-App’s data structure outlined in Fig. 2. Sources of these spaceflight datasets include experiments performed on the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station (ISS), satellites (including the Russian Bion and Foton) and the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft. Ground data are typically from experiments that use terrestrial radiation sources such as particle accelerators and gamma, x-ray, and neutron sources. We have also incorporated summary information from high altitude balloons on Earth26 and orbital and surface data from the Moon, from the journey from Earth to Mars and from the Martian surface by importing data from the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)27, the RAD instrument of the Mars Science Laboratory4,5,28, the Lunar Lander Neutrons and Dosimetry (LND) experiment mounted on the Chang’E 4 lunar lander29–31 and aggregate data from the Apollo astronauts’ Radiation Survey Meters (RSM)32. CRaTER provides data on radiation in lunar orbit and LND for the lunar surface. The RAD measured radiation exposure while both in transit to Mars and on the Martian surface. Supplementary Table 1 presents a summary of these balloon, lunar and Mars-related data. Fig. 2. Rad-Bio-App’s data structure. Open in a new tab Rad-Bio-App imports datasets from ground-based space radiation simulations, spaceflight experiments, the RAD detector of the Curiosity Rover, the CRaTER instrument on the lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the LRD of the Chang’E 4 lunar lander, the RaD-X high altitude balloon and dosimetry from Apollo missions. These datasets are linked in a relational database within the Qlik data management system. At the time of writing, the App contains data from 132 accessions, each with associated metadata including: Accession #, GeneLab GLDS-Accession #, Radiation Sub-Accession (individual GLDS accessions contain data from multiple treatments, which we define as sub-accessions and denote as GLDS#.#, e.g., GLDS-93.1, GLDS-93.2 etc.), organism, analysis type (trancriptomics, genomics, metabolomics etc.), radiation type, particle charge, particle mass, radiation source, particle LET (keV/µm), energy (MeV classified to ions, gamma-rays, or x-rays), minimal radiation group, total absorbed radiation dose (Gy), summary dose rate (Gy/day), exposure duration, general radiation group, vehicle (for spaceflight experiments), sample location, (for spaceflight experiments), and dosimeter type.When combined with the linked GeneLab metadata of features such as species, hardware, and radiation type, this data architecture allows the user to explore, filter, and compare the radiation environments experienced across many different types of space biology studies and even those of likely future missions. The resulting lists of GLDS datasets selected for specific characteristics of radiation exposure, then offer the possibility of further interrogating the associated omics data within GeneLab, employing either GeneLab’s visualization portal tools or other custom techniques (e.g., for plants, exploration within the TOAST database33). Such approaches allow the researcher to search for molecular fingerprints between experiments that are associated with common or different radiation exposures, and also ask how other factors within the experiment may be impacting these responses. The Rad-Bio-App should therefore help the scientific community both explore how biology responds to ionizing radiation exposure in the context of spaceflight, and also help identify space radiation conditions currently not being simulated on the ground. It is important to note here that within the data visualization portal on the GeneLab website users can search for omics datasets related to specific radiation metadata classes: radiation type, energy, dose, and dose rate. Rad-Bio-App complements these capabilities by extending the range and details of the searchable radiation metadata, and providing an interactive ability to apply quantitative filters simultaneously across all datasets. To give one example of the utility of implementing such extended capabilities: for operational reasons related to the available radiation source, there is a great deal of data from ground-based studies on a number of different organisms exposed to iron ions at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Fig. 3). Thus, these datasets potentially provide a wealth of insight by comparing experiments with similar irradiation characteristics. A user who is expert in this area would know to search for this type of radiation exposure to aggregate this extensive set of results, a task addressable through GeneLab’s visualization portal. Using the Rad-Bio-App, a biologist relatively new to the space radiation field would quickly identify iron as a radiation type that is rich in datasets through simple exploration of the graphical representation of the aggregate terrestrial radiation data (Fig. 3). Further, they could rapidly define whether their species of interest lie within these datasets. Thus, Rad-Bio-App should also help to broaden access and usage of these kinds of data23 by allowing researchers who do not specialize in radiation biology to begin to incorporate potential radiation effects into their analyses and experimental designs. Fig. 3. Datasets for terrestrial experiments exposing biology to different radiation types that are deposited at GeneLab and cross-referenced within the Rad-Bio-App. Open in a new tab Shown inset is the distribution of species for the Fe datasets. Mixed LEO represents the varied array of spaceflight data. Output extracted from elements of Rad-Bio-App’s graphical interface. The characteristics of the radiation data within Rad-Bio-App Space radiation comprises a mix of particles and energies arising from the Sun and the background galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) that originates outside of the Solar System34. Therefore, Rad-Bio-App provides filtering tools to help navigate some of these intricacies. Solar particles consist of an intense flux of mostly protons and electrons with energies up to about 100 keV, but sporadic solar particle events can accelerate these particles to higher energies (about 1–10 MeV35). GCR consists of protons and heavier ions ejected from supernovae and can be even more energetic (above 100 MeV/nucleon). Nuclear or electromagnetic interactions of such primary radiation with other materials, such as the hull or shielding within a spacecraft can also lead the production of secondary particles. These secondary particles include protons, neutrons, and light charged fragments, which can themselves be highly penetrating and, as for solar particles and GCR, biologically damaging6. To help address this complexity in the spectrum of the types of radiation that may be present in an experiment, the Rad-Bio-App allows filtering of the data for specific energies and doses and, for the terrestrial studies with well-defined radiation sources, by the radiation quality (e.g., alpha, Fe nucleus, proton, etc.). In relation to effects on biological systems, a further key characteristic of radiation is the energy it can deliver over a distance traveled (its Linear Energy Transfer, or LET, typically expressed in kiloelectron volts per micrometer; keV/µm). Low LET radiation is loosely defined to consist of particles with <10 keV/μm, such as protons and electrons, whereas high LET radiation is composed of energetic nuclei with greater penetrating power and consequently a greater potential to damage biological molecules36. However, even low LET radiation can still readily disrupt biological processes through effects such as DNA damage and oxidative stress37,38. Therefore, the Rad-Bio-App allows filtering on the LET of the radiation quality when known. The dose vs. dose rate challenge One other major challenge in studying the effects of space radiation on biology is the difficulty of simulating the spectrum of space radiation conditions in the laboratory, whether on the ground or in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This issue makes it important to place the inferences a researcher can draw from Rad-Bio-App-based analyses in this context. Particle accelerator facilities on Earth, such as the NSRL, can provide low absolute doses to try to mimic expected radiation exposure in space but generally these have to be delivered in an acute manner, i.e., at dose rates on the order of Gy/min, compared to the typical rates of hundreds of µGy/day that are experienced in Space. In addition, until recently, exposures in these ground-based experiments were limited to one particle type at one energy at a time, whereas, as discussed above, space radiation represents a complex mix of radiation types. Rad-Bio-App provides filters for dose rate and particle types, when known, to help place these space radiation analog experiments in context. Fortunately, ground facilities, while still limited to relatively high dose rates, are developing more sophisticated mixed field capabilities that promise to more closely mimic the spectrum of particles eliciting space radiation effects. However, it remains a significant challenge to perform faithful space radiation-related analog experiments on the ground, and so it is critical to remember these issues when conducting Rad-Bio-App analyses. Orbiting spacecraft offer dose rates more appropriate for understanding space-related effects on biology, but again when using the Rad-Bio-App for comparisons between datasets it is important to be aware of the effects of the locale on the radiation environment. Thus, although particle types are generally not recorded for experiments conducted in spaceflight (Rad-Bio-App classes these as “Mixed” radiation), the effects of shielding from the magnetosphere means that radiation exposures in LEO will likely have a much higher proton contribution than will exploration missions traveling to the Moon and beyond. Future missions such as Artemis39, Lunar Gateway40, and BioSentinel41 promise to provide data from biology operating well beyond these confounding effects of LEO. Both the GeneLab data system and Bio-Rad-App are designed to readily incorporate information from these new facilities and missions as they become available to help more faithfully align future analyses to the range of likely space radiation profiles. Architecture of the Rad-Bio-App exploration environment Rad-Bio-App is built using the Qlik database management software (Qlik Technologies Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA). Radiation data have been aggregated from NASA’s GeneLab data repository21,23 and data recorded by the RaD-X high-altitude balloon mission, CRaTER, the RAD, the LRD and on Apollo missions. These datasets and associated metadata were then manually curated and linked through the Qlik software engine to provide a searchable relational database (Fig. 2). Qlik provides customizable interactive representations of datasets, allowing for their presentation as a simple graphical user interface built around data-centric dashboards. Data filters are incorporated allowing the user to rapidly narrow searches and comparisons by e.g., organism, radiation type, or mission and these filters then spawn to all other datasets and analysis dashboards, allowing the user to reiteratively narrow their search and comparisons across the breadth of all the data within Rad-Bio-App as described below. Navigating the Rad-Bio-App: dashboards Rad-Bio-App is navigated through an initial menu or index page that presents icons and brief descriptions linking to additional pages or dashboards, as shown in Fig. 4. Each dashboard simplifies the access to a particular kind of radiation data along with the visualization and filtering tools to be able to explore those datasets. Fig. 4. Navigation within Rad-Bio-App is through dashboards accessed from a central menu page. Open in a new tab Each data exploration dashboard allows for reiterative, interactive filtering on factors such as radiation type, mission, and spaceflight hardware and allows for both dynamic visualization of the filter effects and for export of the filtered data to a spreadsheet.Dashboard #1 lets the researcher find datasets by radiation exposure level. Users land on a summary of the average radiation exposure each organism experienced during an experiment indexed to the relevant dataset within the GeneLab data repository. These radiation data can be further filtered on metadata factors such as radiation type, radiation source, and exposure levels. Dashboard #2 lets the user find datasets by the type of radiation from different sources. One will notice in this dashboard that a large number of datasets are classified as LEO experiments (e.g., ISS, Space Shuttle), whereas radiation data related to terrestrial experimentation allows, e.g., selecting the particle of interest (e.g., 1 GeV/n Fe). The Rad-Bio-App provides additional filtering of these datasets on features such as organism and the analytical approach used to assess biological response (e.g., transcriptomics, genomics, and proteomics). Dashboard #3 lets the user focus on experiments conducted in space, which typically have much lower dose rates than experiments on Earth and reflect chronic exposure lasting days to weeks. As such, the dashboard lands on a graph displaying radiation doses as a function of duration. One can sub-select these spaceflight-related experiments by filtering for, e.g., mission, dosimeter, and flight hardware. It is important to note that, unlike terrestrial radiation experiments that use defined radiation sources, the precise kinds of particles responsible for the radiation exposure in most spaceflight experiments are not measured and so, as noted above, they are grouped collectively as “Mixed” radiation exposures on this dashboard. Therefore, the filter for radiation source or group in dashboard #3 is based on the region of space, where the measurement was taken (such as LEO) rather than specific radiation type as available for the terrestrial studies in the previous dashboard. Dashboard #4 provides an example of a comparative analysis between maximum, minimum and average lunar orbit, lunar surface, Martian surface, and Earth-to-Mars transit radiation doses versus the wealth of spaceflight and terrestrial biological experiments available at NASA’s GeneLab data repository. The long duration of data capture for these Moon-space and Mars-space measurements means that elements such as intense solar particle events, when the Sun emits extremely high levels of radiation for a short duration, can impact on average measurements. Therefore, in addition to maximum and minimum exposures, Rad-Bio-App presents several “average” exposure rates for the lunar and Martian datasets. These averages include both values with high intensity stochastic events included and measurements drawn from periods, when these events did not occur (summarized in Supplementary Table 1). For the Martian data, we also present average measurements from the RAD’s Si detector and the Si detector data corrected for radiation penetration into water. This latter measurement provides a closer analog of how the radiation is likely interacting with biology than the Si detector’s raw output. This correction relies upon a calculation from the Si detector’s measurement using a dose conversion factor, and so should be taken as an approximation5. Glossary Dashboard: Finally, the App also presents a glossary of terms on the main dashboard index page and mousing over this table reveals a full screen expansion icon, allowing the glossary to be seen on a single browser page. The homepage of the Rad-Bio-App also links to a video tutorial, which leads potential users through accessing some of the basic functions of the App. Test case: understanding radiation biology on the lunar surface The Rad-Bio-App is designed to allow researchers rapid access to data on the radiation environment of a particular study and to make easy comparisons across datasets to reveal new insight. As an example, we have used Rad-Bio-App to explore possible effects of the radiation in the lunar environment. Thus, as the sights of the spaceflight community begin to widen to include crewed missions to the Moon and eventually Mars, it becomes crucial to ask how radiation will affect biology under these conditions. However, to date, with the exception of the 27 Apollo astronauts who travelled to the Moon and the short duration of the seedling germination experiment in China’s Chang’E-4 mission29,30, we have no data on the functioning of biology in the lunar environment. How then to make predictions about the radiation effects to inform the future missions to this destination? Rad-Bio-App incorporates direct radiation measurements made by CRaTER as it orbits the Moon, from the Chang’E-4 lander on the lunar surface and aggregate data from astronaut dosimetry on the Apollo missions. Thus, Rad-Bio-App allows filtering the array of LEO spaceflight and terrestrial data from NASA’s Genelab repository for radiation exposures lying close those expected for the lunar environs. An example of this kind of analysis is shown in Figs. 5 and 6, using Dashboard #4 of the Rad-Bio-App. For this analysis, we explored the lunar surface environment and so used the direct measurements of lunar surface radiation made by Chang’E 4 to ask, if there were datasets within the GeneLab data repository that might help inform on how biology would act under these radiation conditions. Briefly, we took the average mixed lunar surface radiation dose rate from the LRD detector on Chang’E-4 (0.55 mGy/day) and set limits of 2x − 0.5x (i.e., searching for <1.1 to >0.25 mGy/day—see Fig. 5 step 2), assuming it would broadly cover a likely lunar radiation dose rate. This approach identified 32 experiments (Fig. 5, step 3), generating a table at the bottom of the dashboard which we downloaded by clicking on the download icon (down green arrow in Fig. 5, step 4). Rad-Bio-App further showed that the corresponding datasets span ten different organisms. Here, we capitalized on the synergy possible between the well-curated data repository at GeneLab and the rapid dataset surveys possible through Rad-Bio-App. Thus, interrogating the GeneLab data repository revealed gene expression analysis was performed on flight samples versus a paired ground control in most of the studies identified in the above analysis. Rad-Bio-App also readily showed that the majority (15) of these studies were from mice, with analyses of whole genome gene expression performed using either microarray or RNAseq technologies. In addition, cross-referencing to the GeneLab visualization portal revealed that most of these datasets have been processed through GeneLab’s uniform microarray or RNAseq software pipelines (Overbey et al.42). That is, these datasets have been pre-processed within the GeneLab data system using the same computational approaches, and the analyzed results on differential gene expression deposited and made publicly available for download. Fig. 5. Example of use of Rad-Bio-App to define datasets within the GeneLab data repository mimicking a lunar surface exposure. Open in a new tab The data within dashboard #4 of the Rad-Bio-App contains radiation data from Martian, lunar and spaceflight missions and ground-based radiation experiments. These data were filtered using radiation levels recorded on the lunar surface by the Chang’e 4 lander, with limits set to span a 2-fold range around the average dose rate (0.55 mGy/d). Results of this filtering were then exported to build a listing of spaceflight experiment datasets within the GeneLab data repository where their radiation exposure lies within this range of dose rates. Green numbers in table, datasets pre-processed by either the GeneLab uniform microarray or RNAseq analysis pipelines.Fig. 6. Analysis of radiation responsive mouse genes showing altered expression in spaceflight. Open in a new tab a Log2-fold change of differentially expressed genes (flight vs ground or flight vs. basal) from mouse RNAseq datasets identified from Fig. 5 (GLDS 243, 244, 246, 247, 248) were cross-referenced to genes annotated as being radiation responsive in the RadAtlas database50. b Ontology enrichment analysis performed using Metascape51. Ground control is sample harvested synchronously with flight samples, basal control are samples harvested immediately prior to flight.Briefly, for these analytical pipelines, the GeneLab analyses were implemented in the Galaxy software environment43, with the microarray analysis using the R/Bioconductor software package Limma44 and RNA-seq using STAR (v2.7.1a45) and RSEM (v1.3.146). Further descriptions of the processing and links to the analytical codes used, along with the deposited analyzed datasets are available on the Genelab website22. Application of the same analytical steps for each dataset allows for much more robust comparisons between studies, and the free access to the deposited results greatly speeds and simplifies subsequent exploration. These analyses then provided us with target datasets within the GeneLab data repository to explore for common molecular signatures from biology experiencing radiation dose rates similar to what we might predict on future missions to the Moon. One must note here that comparing microarray and RNAseq datasets can be complex to perform and interpret due to potential artifacts generated by mixing results from these different analytical technologies (e.g., ref. 47). Therefore, to increase the robustness of our further analyses, we focused on five RNAseq datasets derived from the same mission: Rodent Research 6 (RR6)48. These RR6 datasets were from five different tissues: dorsal skin, thymus, spleen, colon, and lung, respectively (i.e., GLDS 243, 244, 246, 247, and 248) and they were processed using the GeneLab RNAseq pipeline42. These datasets had multiple controls: tissues were either collected from sacrificed animals and then preserved (i.e., euthanasia), versus where the whole animal was first frozen (to be dissected later by thawing) at the same time as carcasses preserved in space by astronauts (i.e., carcass). Another factor differentiating various controls were animals sacrificed just before the mission (i.e., basal control) versus animals sacrificed on the ground at the same time as in space (i.e., ground control—GC). Such experimental factors were recently described in detail and their impact on gene expression discussed49. These five different tissues provided ten flight-to-basal-control and five flight-to-GC comparisons within the pre-processed datasets deposited at GeneLab, and so we downloaded the gene expression data for these 15 comparisons from the GeneLab data repository for further analysis. We next interrogated the RadAtlas50, a tool that provides an aggregation of gene expression profiles of radiation-associated and radiation-responsive genes drawn from the ground-based literature. We downloaded the aggregated data from the RadAtlas and asked, which of the genes identified as transcriptionally responsive to radiation in that tool also showed transcriptional changes in the mouse spaceflight RNAseq datasets described above (Supplementary Data 1). We then filtered this list to ask, of these genes, which of them showed agreement in either induction or repression in spaceflight to greater than 2-fold in at least four of the mouse datasets. To increase the rigor of this filtering, we set the further criterion that no dataset showed a conflicting response. i.e., if four or more datasets showed induction of a particular gene, none of the other datasets also showed repression at the 2-fold cutoff (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 1). This thresholding allowed us to identify putative shared radiation response genes whilst filtering out those showing small or inconsistent responses. We then used the gene network annotation and analysis tool Metascape51 to visualize the functional groupings (ontologies) associated with these sets of genes (Fig. 6b). This list showed enrichment in features ranging from T-cell apoptosis, to DNA repair and the regulation of the cell cycle, providing targets for future exploration of possible radiation effects in the spaceflight environment through e.g., targeted flight experimentation.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions To conclude, we have introduced a data mining visualization tool, the Rad-Bio-App, enabling the rapid identification of omics datasets deposited in the NASA GeneLab data repository, which are relevant for a specific spaceflight radiation scenario (e.g., trip to Mars or on the lunar surface) or specific characteristics of radiation exposure. Testing this tool on a scenario of a mission on the Moon, we identified a series of experiments conducted on the ISS with similar radiation profiles. Because the Rad-Bio-App links to GeneLab datasets, it was then straightforward to extract processed gene expression tables from GeneLab to identify common pathways that may be modified by, in this case, the lunar surface radiation environment. As more researchers enter datasets into GeneLab related to spaceflight and radiation exposure that explore the effects of e.g., species, genetics, gender, and age, the Rad-Bio-App should become an increasingly powerful tool to help accelerate assessment of the effects of Space radiation environments on living entities.",

Copyright notice ID: 8113475 PMID: 33976230 Abstract In addition to microgravity, spaceflight simultaneously exposes biology to a suite of other stimuli. For example, in space, organisms experience ionizing radiation environments that significantly differ in both quality and quantity from those normally experienced on Earth. However, data on radiation exposure during space missions is often complex to access and to understand, limiting progress towards defining how radiation affects organisms against the unique background of spaceflight. To help address this challenge, we have developed the Rad-Bio-App. This web-accessible database imports radiation metadata from experiments archived in NASA’s GeneLab data repository, and then allows the user to explore these experiments both in the context of their radiation exposure and through their other metadata and results. Rad-Bio-App provides an easy-to-use, graphically-driven environment to enable both radiation biologists and non-specialist researchers to visualize, and understand the impact of ionizing radiation on various biological systems in the context of spaceflight. Subject terms: Databases, Physiology, Plant sciences, Microbiology, Molecular biologyIntroduction The space environment introduces organisms to a unique range of challenges. For example, for humans the closed environment of space vehicles alongside enforced confinement, and the isolation inherent in the vast distances traveled all have important impacts on the functioning of the crew’s physiology and psychology (Fig. 1). Many of these effects are being explored in Earth-based analogs, such as the Hawaii Space Analog and Simulation and the Scientific International Research in Unique Terrestrial Station missions1,2. However, some features of space are complex or impossible to simulate on the Earth’s surface, requiring exploration through the relatively rare opportunity of a spaceflight experiment. For example, exposure to sustained microgravity and to the increased ionizing radiation in space are both beyond the experience of terrestrial biology, and currently almost impossible to mimic on the Earth’s surface. Thus, their individual and combined effects on biology remain poorly understood, yet these are likely to be critical factors in how organisms respond to living in space. Fig. 1. Physical and biological factors affecting human space exploration and their associated stressors including isolation, long confinement in closed environments, microgravity, and ionizing radiation. Open in a new tab These factors are likely to act both alone and in combination to impose effects on the crew in space.A combination of the shielding effects of the atmosphere and the ability of the magnetosphere to deflect radiation around the planet means, that for most of Earth’s history its organisms have been relatively protected from space radiation. Although terrestrial life does encounter natural background radiation from geological sources and UV radiation from the Sun, it is low by comparison to space, with an average annual dose equivalent per person in the US of around 6 mSv3, depending on altitude and soil composition (e.g., the presence of minerals that produce radon gas). In deep space, the radiation exposures will be much higher and include highly ionizing single particles not normally found on Earth. Based on data from the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) during its cruise phase from Earth to Mars and the measurements it made on the Martian surface, the crew on a ~1000 day mission to Mars, assuming “quiet” periods of solar activity throughout, would receive ~360 mGy absorbed dose, much of it from highly ionizing galactic cosmic ray (GCR) ions4,5. This is similar to several decades of absorbed background dose on Earth, but as noted, from a very different spectrum of radiation and delivered at a very different dose rate. All of these factors are likely to play into the precise effects this radiation exposure will have on the crew of such a mission, making it complex to extrapolate from terrestrial models to the spaceflight environment. Indeed, the effects of exposure to space radiation have been shown to induce more deleterious effects in tissues than similar doses of ionizing radiation on Earth, with, e.g., as much as 40 times more biological effectiveness to induce Harderian gland cancers in mice6. However, in addition to inducing cancer, radiation exposure in mammals can lead to a wide array of cellular and microenvironment effects such as chronic inflammation, tissue degeneration and impaired nerve function (e.g., refs. 7,8). Indeed, all organisms are subject to radiation effects, with animals, microbes, and plants experiencing a variety of radiation-induced cellular events ranging from DNA damage and oxidative stress to shifts in metabolism9,10. Different species exhibit varying degrees of radiation tolerance and within a species radiation response is modulated by an individual’s genetics11–14. For example, bacteria in the genus Deinococcus can survive radiation doses far in excess of those that would be lethal in humans15. Predicting such effects are further confounded by the influence of the spaceflight environment, such as living in microgravity, which itself modulates an organism’s radiation response (e.g., refs. 16–18). These complexities in potential biological effects coupled with the relatively limited opportunities to perform direct spaceflight experiments make assessing the risks of radiation exposure to crew members on extended, deep space missions extremely difficult19,20. Yet, as the duration and distances of spaceflight missions increase, the question of how different organisms respond to the effects of increased space radiation exposure and the potential for interactions with, e.g., the microgravity of spaceflight becomes increasingly important to address. To date, much biology-focused spaceflight experimentation has been published without its associated radiation data and though radiation exposure has usually been recorded, it is often not readily accessible. This gap has been recognized by the NASA GeneLab project, which acts as a repository for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from experiments flown in space or exposed to simulated space stressors21–23. Alongside the raw omics datasets, the GeneLab data repository organizes associated metadata into a publicly accessible database called the GeneLab Data System (GLDS21,22). Mining of GeneLab’s omics data then enables exploration of the network of molecular responses to space environments as a function of experimental factors described in the metadata. GeneLab has now aggregated much of the radiation metadata associated with its spaceflight-related datasets24. In other words, the GLDS now provides the raw materials of data and metadata for making broad inferences about radiation effects across multiple sets of spaceflight experiments and in different organisms. The GeneLab Application Programming Interface (API) also enables access to these data by external web applications, with the aim of allowing the scientific community to deploy custom tools to visualize and explore these data in ways complementary to the capabilities available in GeneLab’s own data visualization portal. In the work presented here, we introduce one such custom visualization tool, the Rad-Bio-App (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astro-rad-bio-app). Rad-Bio-App capitalizes on the “FAIRness” standards and rich data curation of the GLDS25 to provide an interactive graphical interface through which investigators can visualize, filter, and compare radiation dosimetry and other metadata across the GLDS. The reiterative filtering capabilities of Rad-Bio-App further allow the user to define datasets with potentially common radiation effects, or to explore interactions between radiation exposure and a variety of space-related experimental conditions. These datasets then provide targets for further in-depth analyses using a variety of bioinformatics-related tools. Overall design and goals of the Rad-Bio-App The overall goal of the Rad-Bio-App is to allow users to develop filtered, curated lists of omics datasets within the GeneLab data repository, that can then be explored for predicted radiation-related responses. Therefore, documenting the origin of such data is of paramount importance and is central to the Rad-Bio-App’s data structure outlined in Fig. 2. Sources of these spaceflight datasets include experiments performed on the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station (ISS), satellites (including the Russian Bion and Foton) and the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft. Ground data are typically from experiments that use terrestrial radiation sources such as particle accelerators and gamma, x-ray, and neutron sources. We have also incorporated summary information from high altitude balloons on Earth26 and orbital and surface data from the Moon, from the journey from Earth to Mars and from the Martian surface by importing data from the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)27, the RAD instrument of the Mars Science Laboratory4,5,28, the Lunar Lander Neutrons and Dosimetry (LND) experiment mounted on the Chang’E 4 lunar lander29–31 and aggregate data from the Apollo astronauts’ Radiation Survey Meters (RSM)32. CRaTER provides data on radiation in lunar orbit and LND for the lunar surface. The RAD measured radiation exposure while both in transit to Mars and on the Martian surface. Supplementary Table 1 presents a summary of these balloon, lunar and Mars-related data. Fig. 2. Rad-Bio-App’s data structure. Open in a new tab Rad-Bio-App imports datasets from ground-based space radiation simulations, spaceflight experiments, the RAD detector of the Curiosity Rover, the CRaTER instrument on the lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the LRD of the Chang’E 4 lunar lander, the RaD-X high altitude balloon and dosimetry from Apollo missions. These datasets are linked in a relational database within the Qlik data management system. At the time of writing, the App contains data from 132 accessions, each with associated metadata including: Accession #, GeneLab GLDS-Accession #, Radiation Sub-Accession (individual GLDS accessions contain data from multiple treatments, which we define as sub-accessions and denote as GLDS#.#, e.g., GLDS-93.1, GLDS-93.2 etc.), organism, analysis type (trancriptomics, genomics, metabolomics etc.), radiation type, particle charge, particle mass, radiation source, particle LET (keV/µm), energy (MeV classified to ions, gamma-rays, or x-rays), minimal radiation group, total absorbed radiation dose (Gy), summary dose rate (Gy/day), exposure duration, general radiation group, vehicle (for spaceflight experiments), sample location, (for spaceflight experiments), and dosimeter type.When combined with the linked GeneLab metadata of features such as species, hardware, and radiation type, this data architecture allows the user to explore, filter, and compare the radiation environments experienced across many different types of space biology studies and even those of likely future missions. The resulting lists of GLDS datasets selected for specific characteristics of radiation exposure, then offer the possibility of further interrogating the associated omics data within GeneLab, employing either GeneLab’s visualization portal tools or other custom techniques (e.g., for plants, exploration within the TOAST database33). Such approaches allow the researcher to search for molecular fingerprints between experiments that are associated with common or different radiation exposures, and also ask how other factors within the experiment may be impacting these responses. The Rad-Bio-App should therefore help the scientific community both explore how biology responds to ionizing radiation exposure in the context of spaceflight, and also help identify space radiation conditions currently not being simulated on the ground. It is important to note here that within the data visualization portal on the GeneLab website users can search for omics datasets related to specific radiation metadata classes: radiation type, energy, dose, and dose rate. Rad-Bio-App complements these capabilities by extending the range and details of the searchable radiation metadata, and providing an interactive ability to apply quantitative filters simultaneously across all datasets. To give one example of the utility of implementing such extended capabilities: for operational reasons related to the available radiation source, there is a great deal of data from ground-based studies on a number of different organisms exposed to iron ions at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Fig. 3). Thus, these datasets potentially provide a wealth of insight by comparing experiments with similar irradiation characteristics. A user who is expert in this area would know to search for this type of radiation exposure to aggregate this extensive set of results, a task addressable through GeneLab’s visualization portal. Using the Rad-Bio-App, a biologist relatively new to the space radiation field would quickly identify iron as a radiation type that is rich in datasets through simple exploration of the graphical representation of the aggregate terrestrial radiation data (Fig. 3). Further, they could rapidly define whether their species of interest lie within these datasets. Thus, Rad-Bio-App should also help to broaden access and usage of these kinds of data23 by allowing researchers who do not specialize in radiation biology to begin to incorporate potential radiation effects into their analyses and experimental designs. Fig. 3. Datasets for terrestrial experiments exposing biology to different radiation types that are deposited at GeneLab and cross-referenced within the Rad-Bio-App. Open in a new tab Shown inset is the distribution of species for the Fe datasets. Mixed LEO represents the varied array of spaceflight data. Output extracted from elements of Rad-Bio-App’s graphical interface.The characteristics of the radiation data within Rad-Bio-App Space radiation comprises a mix of particles and energies arising from the Sun and the background galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) that originates outside of the Solar System34. Therefore, Rad-Bio-App provides filtering tools to help navigate some of these intricacies. Solar particles consist of an intense flux of mostly protons and electrons with energies up to about 100 keV, but sporadic solar particle events can accelerate these particles to higher energies (about 1–10 MeV35). GCR consists of protons and heavier ions ejected from supernovae and can be even more energetic (above 100 MeV/nucleon). Nuclear or electromagnetic interactions of such primary radiation with other materials, such as the hull or shielding within a spacecraft can also lead the production of secondary particles. These secondary particles include protons, neutrons, and light charged fragments, which can themselves be highly penetrating and, as for solar particles and GCR, biologically damaging6. To help address this complexity in the spectrum of the types of radiation that may be present in an experiment, the Rad-Bio-App allows filtering of the data for specific energies and doses and, for the terrestrial studies with well-defined radiation sources, by the radiation quality (e.g., alpha, Fe nucleus, proton, etc.). In relation to effects on biological systems, a further key characteristic of radiation is the energy it can deliver over a distance traveled (its Linear Energy Transfer, or LET, typically expressed in kiloelectron volts per micrometer; keV/µm). Low LET radiation is loosely defined to consist of particles with <10 keV/μm, such as protons and electrons, whereas high LET radiation is composed of energetic nuclei with greater penetrating power and consequently a greater potential to damage biological molecules36. However, even low LET radiation can still readily disrupt biological processes through effects such as DNA damage and oxidative stress37,38. Therefore, the Rad-Bio-App allows filtering on the LET of the radiation quality when known.The dose vs. dose rate challenge One other major challenge in studying the effects of space radiation on biology is the difficulty of simulating the spectrum of space radiation conditions in the laboratory, whether on the ground or in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This issue makes it important to place the inferences a researcher can draw from Rad-Bio-App-based analyses in this context. Particle accelerator facilities on Earth, such as the NSRL, can provide low absolute doses to try to mimic expected radiation exposure in space but generally these have to be delivered in an acute manner, i.e., at dose rates on the order of Gy/min, compared to the typical rates of hundreds of µGy/day that are experienced in Space. In addition, until recently, exposures in these ground-based experiments were limited to one particle type at one energy at a time, whereas, as discussed above, space radiation represents a complex mix of radiation types. Rad-Bio-App provides filters for dose rate and particle types, when known, to help place these space radiation analog experiments in context. Fortunately, ground facilities, while still limited to relatively high dose rates, are developing more sophisticated mixed field capabilities that promise to more closely mimic the spectrum of particles eliciting space radiation effects. However, it remains a significant challenge to perform faithful space radiation-related analog experiments on the ground, and so it is critical to remember these issues when conducting Rad-Bio-App analyses. Orbiting spacecraft offer dose rates more appropriate for understanding space-related effects on biology, but again when using the Rad-Bio-App for comparisons between datasets it is important to be aware of the effects of the locale on the radiation environment. Thus, although particle types are generally not recorded for experiments conducted in spaceflight (Rad-Bio-App classes these as “Mixed” radiation), the effects of shielding from the magnetosphere means that radiation exposures in LEO will likely have a much higher proton contribution than will exploration missions traveling to the Moon and beyond. Future missions such as Artemis39, Lunar Gateway40, and BioSentinel41 promise to provide data from biology operating well beyond these confounding effects of LEO. Both the GeneLab data system and Bio-Rad-App are designed to readily incorporate information from these new facilities and missions as they become available to help more faithfully align future analyses to the range of likely space radiation profiles.Architecture of the Rad-Bio-App exploration environment Rad-Bio-App is built using the Qlik database management software (Qlik Technologies Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA). Radiation data have been aggregated from NASA’s GeneLab data repository21,23 and data recorded by the RaD-X high-altitude balloon mission, CRaTER, the RAD, the LRD and on Apollo missions. These datasets and associated metadata were then manually curated and linked through the Qlik software engine to provide a searchable relational database (Fig. 2). Qlik provides customizable interactive representations of datasets, allowing for their presentation as a simple graphical user interface built around data-centric dashboards. Data filters are incorporated allowing the user to rapidly narrow searches and comparisons by e.g., organism, radiation type, or mission and these filters then spawn to all other datasets and analysis dashboards, allowing the user to reiteratively narrow their search and comparisons across the breadth of all the data within Rad-Bio-App as described below.Navigating the Rad-Bio-App: dashboards Rad-Bio-App is navigated through an initial menu or index page that presents icons and brief descriptions linking to additional pages or dashboards, as shown in Fig. 4. Each dashboard simplifies the access to a particular kind of radiation data along with the visualization and filtering tools to be able to explore those datasets. Fig. 4. Navigation within Rad-Bio-App is through dashboards accessed from a central menu page. Open in a new tab Each data exploration dashboard allows for reiterative, interactive filtering on factors such as radiation type, mission, and spaceflight hardware and allows for both dynamic visualization of the filter effects and for export of the filtered data to a spreadsheet.Dashboard #1 lets the researcher find datasets by radiation exposure level. Users land on a summary of the average radiation exposure each organism experienced during an experiment indexed to the relevant dataset within the GeneLab data repository. These radiation data can be further filtered on metadata factors such as radiation type, radiation source, and exposure levels. Dashboard #2 lets the user find datasets by the type of radiation from different sources. One will notice in this dashboard that a large number of datasets are classified as LEO experiments (e.g., ISS, Space Shuttle), whereas radiation data related to terrestrial experimentation allows, e.g., selecting the particle of interest (e.g., 1 GeV/n Fe). The Rad-Bio-App provides additional filtering of these datasets on features such as organism and the analytical approach used to assess biological response (e.g., transcriptomics, genomics, and proteomics). Dashboard #3 lets the user focus on experiments conducted in space, which typically have much lower dose rates than experiments on Earth and reflect chronic exposure lasting days to weeks. As such, the dashboard lands on a graph displaying radiation doses as a function of duration. One can sub-select these spaceflight-related experiments by filtering for, e.g., mission, dosimeter, and flight hardware. It is important to note that, unlike terrestrial radiation experiments that use defined radiation sources, the precise kinds of particles responsible for the radiation exposure in most spaceflight experiments are not measured and so, as noted above, they are grouped collectively as “Mixed” radiation exposures on this dashboard. Therefore, the filter for radiation source or group in dashboard #3 is based on the region of space, where the measurement was taken (such as LEO) rather than specific radiation type as available for the terrestrial studies in the previous dashboard. Dashboard #4 provides an example of a comparative analysis between maximum, minimum and average lunar orbit, lunar surface, Martian surface, and Earth-to-Mars transit radiation doses versus the wealth of spaceflight and terrestrial biological experiments available at NASA’s GeneLab data repository. The long duration of data capture for these Moon-space and Mars-space measurements means that elements such as intense solar particle events, when the Sun emits extremely high levels of radiation for a short duration, can impact on average measurements. Therefore, in addition to maximum and minimum exposures, Rad-Bio-App presents several “average” exposure rates for the lunar and Martian datasets. These averages include both values with high intensity stochastic events included and measurements drawn from periods, when these events did not occur (summarized in Supplementary Table 1). For the Martian data, we also present average measurements from the RAD’s Si detector and the Si detector data corrected for radiation penetration into water. This latter measurement provides a closer analog of how the radiation is likely interacting with biology than the Si detector’s raw output. This correction relies upon a calculation from the Si detector’s measurement using a dose conversion factor, and so should be taken as an approximation5. Glossary Dashboard: Finally, the App also presents a glossary of terms on the main dashboard index page and mousing over this table reveals a full screen expansion icon, allowing the glossary to be seen on a single browser page. The homepage of the Rad-Bio-App also links to a video tutorial, which leads potential users through accessing some of the basic functions of the App.Test case: understanding radiation biology on the lunar surface The Rad-Bio-App is designed to allow researchers rapid access to data on the radiation environment of a particular study and to make easy comparisons across datasets to reveal new insight. As an example, we have used Rad-Bio-App to explore possible effects of the radiation in the lunar environment. Thus, as the sights of the spaceflight community begin to widen to include crewed missions to the Moon and eventually Mars, it becomes crucial to ask how radiation will affect biology under these conditions. However, to date, with the exception of the 27 Apollo astronauts who travelled to the Moon and the short duration of the seedling germination experiment in China’s Chang’E-4 mission29,30, we have no data on the functioning of biology in the lunar environment. How then to make predictions about the radiation effects to inform the future missions to this destination? Rad-Bio-App incorporates direct radiation measurements made by CRaTER as it orbits the Moon, from the Chang’E-4 lander on the lunar surface and aggregate data from astronaut dosimetry on the Apollo missions. Thus, Rad-Bio-App allows filtering the array of LEO spaceflight and terrestrial data from NASA’s Genelab repository for radiation exposures lying close those expected for the lunar environs. An example of this kind of analysis is shown in Figs. 5 and 6, using Dashboard #4 of the Rad-Bio-App. For this analysis, we explored the lunar surface environment and so used the direct measurements of lunar surface radiation made by Chang’E 4 to ask, if there were datasets within the GeneLab data repository that might help inform on how biology would act under these radiation conditions. Briefly, we took the average mixed lunar surface radiation dose rate from the LRD detector on Chang’E-4 (0.55 mGy/day) and set limits of 2x − 0.5x (i.e., searching for <1.1 to >0.25 mGy/day—see Fig. 5 step 2), assuming it would broadly cover a likely lunar radiation dose rate. This approach identified 32 experiments (Fig. 5, step 3), generating a table at the bottom of the dashboard which we downloaded by clicking on the download icon (down green arrow in Fig. 5, step 4). Rad-Bio-App further showed that the corresponding datasets span ten different organisms. Here, we capitalized on the synergy possible between the well-curated data repository at GeneLab and the rapid dataset surveys possible through Rad-Bio-App. Thus, interrogating the GeneLab data repository revealed gene expression analysis was performed on flight samples versus a paired ground control in most of the studies identified in the above analysis. Rad-Bio-App also readily showed that the majority (15) of these studies were from mice, with analyses of whole genome gene expression performed using either microarray or RNAseq technologies. In addition, cross-referencing to the GeneLab visualization portal revealed that most of these datasets have been processed through GeneLab’s uniform microarray or RNAseq software pipelines (Overbey et al.42). That is, these datasets have been pre-processed within the GeneLab data system using the same computational approaches, and the analyzed results on differential gene expression deposited and made publicly available for download. Fig. 5. Example of use of Rad-Bio-App to define datasets within the GeneLab data repository mimicking a lunar surface exposure. Open in a new tab The data within dashboard #4 of the Rad-Bio-App contains radiation data from Martian, lunar and spaceflight missions and ground-based radiation experiments. These data were filtered using radiation levels recorded on the lunar surface by the Chang’e 4 lander, with limits set to span a 2-fold range around the average dose rate (0.55 mGy/d). Results of this filtering were then exported to build a listing of spaceflight experiment datasets within the GeneLab data repository where their radiation exposure lies within this range of dose rates. Green numbers in table, datasets pre-processed by either the GeneLab uniform microarray or RNAseq analysis pipelines.Fig. 6. Analysis of radiation responsive mouse genes showing altered expression in spaceflight. Open in a new tab a Log2-fold change of differentially expressed genes (flight vs ground or flight vs. basal) from mouse RNAseq datasets identified from Fig. 5 (GLDS 243, 244, 246, 247, 248) were cross-referenced to genes annotated as being radiation responsive in the RadAtlas database50. b Ontology enrichment analysis performed using Metascape51. Ground control is sample harvested synchronously with flight samples, basal control are samples harvested immediately prior to flight.Briefly, for these analytical pipelines, the GeneLab analyses were implemented in the Galaxy software environment43, with the microarray analysis using the R/Bioconductor software package Limma44 and RNA-seq using STAR (v2.7.1a45) and RSEM (v1.3.146). Further descriptions of the processing and links to the analytical codes used, along with the deposited analyzed datasets are available on the Genelab website22. Application of the same analytical steps for each dataset allows for much more robust comparisons between studies, and the free access to the deposited results greatly speeds and simplifies subsequent exploration. These analyses then provided us with target datasets within the GeneLab data repository to explore for common molecular signatures from biology experiencing radiation dose rates similar to what we might predict on future missions to the Moon. One must note here that comparing microarray and RNAseq datasets can be complex to perform and interpret due to potential artifacts generated by mixing results from these different analytical technologies (e.g., ref. 47). Therefore, to increase the robustness of our further analyses, we focused on five RNAseq datasets derived from the same mission: Rodent Research 6 (RR6)48. These RR6 datasets were from five different tissues: dorsal skin, thymus, spleen, colon, and lung, respectively (i.e., GLDS 243, 244, 246, 247, and 248) and they were processed using the GeneLab RNAseq pipeline42. These datasets had multiple controls: tissues were either collected from sacrificed animals and then preserved (i.e., euthanasia), versus where the whole animal was first frozen (to be dissected later by thawing) at the same time as carcasses preserved in space by astronauts (i.e., carcass). Another factor differentiating various controls were animals sacrificed just before the mission (i.e., basal control) versus animals sacrificed on the ground at the same time as in space (i.e., ground control—GC). Such experimental factors were recently described in detail and their impact on gene expression discussed49. These five different tissues provided ten flight-to-basal-control and five flight-to-GC comparisons within the pre-processed datasets deposited at GeneLab, and so we downloaded the gene expression data for these 15 comparisons from the GeneLab data repository for further analysis. We next interrogated the RadAtlas50, a tool that provides an aggregation of gene expression profiles of radiation-associated and radiation-responsive genes drawn from the ground-based literature. We downloaded the aggregated data from the RadAtlas and asked, which of the genes identified as transcriptionally responsive to radiation in that tool also showed transcriptional changes in the mouse spaceflight RNAseq datasets described above (Supplementary Data 1). We then filtered this list to ask, of these genes, which of them showed agreement in either induction or repression in spaceflight to greater than 2-fold in at least four of the mouse datasets. To increase the rigor of this filtering, we set the further criterion that no dataset showed a conflicting response. i.e., if four or more datasets showed induction of a particular gene, none of the other datasets also showed repression at the 2-fold cutoff (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 1). This thresholding allowed us to identify putative shared radiation response genes whilst filtering out those showing small or inconsistent responses. We then used the gene network annotation and analysis tool Metascape51 to visualize the functional groupings (ontologies) associated with these sets of genes (Fig. 6b). This list showed enrichment in features ranging from T-cell apoptosis, to DNA repair and the regulation of the cell cycle, providing targets for future exploration of possible radiation effects in the spaceflight environment through e.g., targeted flight experimentation.Conclusions To conclude, we have introduced a data mining visualization tool, the Rad-Bio-App, enabling the rapid identification of omics datasets deposited in the NASA GeneLab data repository, which are relevant for a specific spaceflight radiation scenario (e.g., trip to Mars or on the lunar surface) or specific characteristics of radiation exposure. Testing this tool on a scenario of a mission on the Moon, we identified a series of experiments conducted on the ISS with similar radiation profiles. Because the Rad-Bio-App links to GeneLab datasets, it was then straightforward to extract processed gene expression tables from GeneLab to identify common pathways that may be modified by, in this case, the lunar surface radiation environment. As more researchers enter datasets into GeneLab related to spaceflight and radiation exposure that explore the effects of e.g., species, genetics, gender, and age, the Rad-Bio-App should become an increasingly powerful tool to help accelerate assessment of the effects of Space radiation environments on living entities.Supplementary information Supplementary Table 1 (144.1KB, pdf) Supplementary Data 1 (253.2KB, xlsx) Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Drs.

    "abstract": "Abstract A plant’s oxygen supply can vary from normal (normoxia) to total depletion (anoxia). Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood. Four functional cation/proton exchangers (CAX1–4) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) help regulate Ca homeostasis around the vacuole. Our results demonstrate that cax1 mutants are more tolerant to both anoxic conditions and submergence. Using phenotypic measurements, RNA-sequencing, and proteomic approaches, we identified cax1-mediated anoxia changes that phenocopy changes present in anoxia-tolerant crops: altered metabolic processes, diminished reactive oxygen species production post anoxia, and altered hormone signaling. Comparing wild-type and cax1 expressing genetically encoded Ca indicators demonstrated altered cytosolic Ca signals in cax1 during reoxygenation. Anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole are involved in the control of numerous signaling events related to adaptation to low oxygen stress. This work suggests that cax1 anoxia response pathway could be engineered to circumvent the adverse effects of flooding that impair production agriculture.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Plants are frequently exposed to limited oxygen availability, influencing plant growth and, in an agricultural context, plant productivity (Loreti et al., 2016; Pedersen et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2018). The lack of oxygen (anoxia) reduces plant energy production (Rawyler et al., 2002). To survive and limit post-anoxic injuries, plants often regulate the flow of the little energy produced under stress conditions to essential processes (Blokhina et al., 2001; Virolainen et al., 2002; Huang et al., 2008; Atwell et al., 2015). In a natural context, submergence leads to multiple abiotic stress-related constraints, including limited light availability and the occurrence of oxidative stress either during or after the period of hypoxic conditions (Sasidharan et al., 2018). Plants respond to submergence by responding to ethylene, which accumulates in plant tissues because of the lower underwater gas diffusion rate. The perception and response to cellular oxygen (O2) levels per se is mediated by a subset of ethylene response factors (ERFs) belonging to the group VII of this large class of transcription factors (ERF-VII; Gibbs et al., 2015). ERF-VIIs induce a set of genes which are required to adapt plant metabolism and growth during low O2 conditions (Paul et al., 2016). Calcium (Ca) signaling is another, less studied, component of plant responses to hypoxia (Igamberdiev and Hill, 2018; Huang et al., 2022). Ca signaling was proposed to control the induction of hypoxia-responsive genes (HRGs) and this would imply a cross-talk of this signaling pathway with the ERF-VII-dependent regulation of HRGs (Subbaiah et al., 1994), although this is not yet been demonstrated. In response to changes in O2 levels, Ca signaling differs among plants, with marked differences between Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) in the spatiotemporal parameters of the observed Ca signatures (Bailey-Serres and Chang, 2005; Behera et al., 2015). Ca signaling differences appear to precede gene expression differences and metabolic fluxes, although precisely how Ca is triggering downstream events remains unclear (Schmidt et al., 2018). Conceptualizing signaling events involved in anoxia perception and tolerance might be useful to improve plant performance both during and after anoxic conditions. Ca is at the nexus between many facets of plant biology (Ali et al., 2007; Ma and Berkowitz, 2007; Choi et al., 2017; Costa et al., 2018; Demidchik et al., 2018). Ca transporters on various membranes help to orchestrate responses to stresses such as changes in temperature and anoxia (Catalá et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2017; Costa et al., 2018; Weigand et al., 2021). Ca pumps and exchangers are found in multiple membrane systems, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), vacuole, and plasma membrane (PM; Blumwald and Poole, 1986). Ca pumps are considered low-capacity, high-affinity efflux systems, but within this broad group of transporters, H+/Ca eXchangers (CAXs) are distinct because they have high capacity and low affinity (Kong et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020). While both Ca pumps and CAXs remove Ca from the cytoplasm, their individual contributions to the control of the magnitude or duration of different stimulus-specific Ca signals remains enigmatic. There are six CAXs in Arabidopsis, but only CAX1–4 are expressed and appear to be predominately localized to the vacuole (Manohar et al., 2011). CAX2 and CAX4 are expressed at lower levels in plants, and most of the research on Ca signaling and homeostasis in plants has focused on the more highly expressed CAX1 and CAX3 (29). CAX1 is expressed in aerial tissue and is the dominant mechanism for Ca accumulation in the leaf (Conn et al., 2011; Whitt et al., 2020); CAX3 is primarily expressed in the roots (Hocking et al., 2017). The absence of CAX1 induces ectopic expression of other CAXs, which is often sufficient to maintain mesophyll cellular uptake of Ca from the apoplast (Cheng et al., 2005). The numerous cax1 lines characterized have subtle phenotypes throughout their life cycle and are virtually indistinguishable from controls in normal growth conditions (Manohar et al., 2011). These subtle phenotypes could be due to the interplay between CAX transporters and other transporters; deletions in CAX1 reduce vacuolar H+/Ca antiport activity by 50%, decrease vacuolar V-type proton ATPase activity by 40% and increase vacuolar Ca-ATPase activity by 36% (Cheng et al., 2003). Plant responses to hypoxia and anoxia have been extensively studied (Atwell et al., 2015; Voesenek and Bailey-Serres, 2013; Voesenek et al., 2016); however, less is known about the contribution of Ca signaling processes governing a plant’s tolerance to low oxygen. Traditional approaches to study these events include differential gene expression studies and comparative genomic analysis (Yeung et al., 2018). Here, our analysis focuses on CAX1, a gene that is neither highly expressed during oxygen stress conditions nor thought to be modified in plants adapted to oxygen limitations. We demonstrate that cax1 plants are extremely tolerant to anoxia conditions and submergence. We established that during post anoxia, cax1 showed reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; additionally, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed cax1 plants displayed apparent changes in transcripts and proteins for Ca transport and numerous signaling pathways. We also investigated how cax1 changed the amplitude and duration of Ca signals during reoxygenation. Our work highlights a central role of tonoplast localized H+/Ca2+ transport in anoxia responses while further defining the molecular choreography of anoxia signaling.",

    "results": "Results CAX1 mediates tolerance to anoxia and submergence Multiple studies have shown that Ca-regulated transporters and proteins like calmodulin demonstrate modified expression during conditions of low O2 (Otsuka et al., 2010; Lokdarshi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). We sought to clarify the role of CAX genes in anoxia tolerance using a seedling survival assay where plants are exposed to anoxic conditions for a period of time and survival monitored upon return to normoxic conditions (ambient air, i.e. ∼21% O2). In our assay, 21-day-old plants (nine rosette leaf development stage (Boyes et al., 2001) were placed in a GasPack anaerobic system that reduced O2 levels in the experimental chamber to ∼0% (Supplemental Figure S1A). After anoxia, phenotypes of the cax lines relative to Col-0 plants were well-defined: the cax1 lines (both cax1-1 and cax1-2) were more tolerant to anoxic conditions and this phenotype was clearly visible 4 days after being removed from the anoxic chamber (Figure 1A). Chlorophyll loss measurements were made to compare the damage during reoxygenation among the tolerant and susceptible lines. At 24-h and 48-h post-anoxia, Col-0 and cax3 displayed more chlorophyll loss, while both cax1 alleles maintained their leaf chlorophyll content (Figure 1B; Liang et al., 2017). After these anoxic conditions, >80% of the cax1 plants remained alive, whereas <15% of the cax3 and Col-0 grew to maturity (Supplemental Figure S1, B and S1C). This tolerance was lost when CAX1 driven by the CAX1 promoter region was expressed in cax1-1 (Figure 1C; Supplemental Figure S1D). Again, this susceptibility was verified by the loss of chlorophyll (Figure 1D). cax2, cax3, and cax4 had instead similar anoxia phenotypes as Col-0 (Supplemental Figure S1E). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Arabidopsis cax1 lines are anoxia tolerant. A, Enhanced anoxia tolerance in cax1-1 and cax1-2 compared to Col-0 and cax3. Twenty-one-day-old plants (nine-rosette leaf stage) were placed in a GasPack Anaerobic system. After 8 h, plants were returned to normoxia conditions and photographed after 4 days. Photographs represent more than 15 biological replicates in each condition. B, Post anoxia cax1 exhibited less chlorophyll loss than Col-0 and cax3. Plants belonging to nine-rosette leaf stage were treated as described in Figure 1B and aerial portions of the plants were sampled 24 and 48 h after returning to normoxia conditions. Plants sampled prior to the anoxic conditions were used as controls. All results are means ± sem, n = 3 and error bars indicate standard error of the mean.

The increase in CAX1 expression in the transgenic lines has been confirmed by RT–qPCR as shown in Supplemental Figure S1E. Assay conditions similar to those described in (B) and (C).We investigated if knockingout CAX1 resulted in enhanced tolerance to submergence and waterlogging in adult Arabidopsis plants grown in soil. Although cax1 growth rate was initially reduced compared to the Col-0, it reached a similar size when grown in air. When plants were submerged for 48 h, followed by 7 days of aerobic recovery, Col-0 plants displayed stunted growth (Figure 2A; Supplemental Figure S2), indicating that the length of oxygen deprivation was long enough to severely affect the ability of the plants to recover from the stress. Remarkably, cax1 was extremely tolerant to submergence, showing none of the symptoms of prolonged hypoxia, namely inability to recover from the submergence treatment and yellowing. Both these parameters were quantified utilizing a phenotyping setup (Ventura et al., 2020), as described in Figure 2, B and C. Similar to the Col-0, the cax3 mutant was also intolerant, as was a CAX1 complementation line (cax1:sCAX1 in cax1-1). Figure 2.

Different letters indicate significant difference (P < 0.05) after Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test. Outliers have been identified using GraphPad 8.0.1 software (Q = 0.1%) and removed from the plots.Next, we explored the possibility that mutations in CAX1 would also result in a tolerant phenotype to waterlogging, whereby only the root system is submerged. This is of interest, given that CAX1 is predominantly expressed in leaves and CAX3 in roots. The phenotype of all genotypes under waterlogging were similar, with enhanced anthocyanin synthesis in the leaves (Figure 3A). The growth of all genotypes stopped under waterlogging (Figure 3B). The size of cax1-1 plants was slightly smaller than the other genotypes under waterlogging (Figure 3C), while the leaf color of cax1-1 turned from red to yellowish (Figure 3D). Overall, while tolerance to submergence was greatly enhanced in cax1-1, CAX1 seems to have a limited role in oxygen deprivation when it is restricted to the root system. Figure 3.

Different letters indicate significant difference (P < 0.05) after Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test. GraphPad 8.0.1 software (Q = 0.1%) did not identify any outliers and hence all the data points are all represented in the plot. CAX1 controls post-anoxia production of reactive oxygen species Given that CAX transporters have been shown to play various roles in altering plant signaling (Shigaki and Hirschi, 2006), we sought to assess its impact on anoxic responses. Oxidative-stress-induced lipid peroxidation (by malondialdehyde measurement in leaves) was elevated in Col-0 and cax3 at 8-h post-anoxia, but both cax1 lines displayed lower lipid peroxidation (Figure 4A; Sattler et al., 2006). Since ROS are important signal molecules mediating plant stress responses and have been closely linked to hypoxia response (Chapman et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021), staining with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was performed (Daudi and O'Brien, 2012). Although the leaves often varied in their responses, the cax1 lines consistently showed lower H2O2 accumulation (Figure 4B). We also measured hydrogen peroxide levels using the cell permeable dye H2DCFDA in plants exposed to anoxic conditions or to normoxia (Fichman et al., 2019). Although there was also variability among the leaves, Col-0 and cax3 plants generally displayed elevated H2O2 post anoxia while cax1 displayed lower levels (Figure 4C). Trypan blue staining of seedlings was performed to investigate cell death during the anoxia stress response. We observed a mild degree of cell death in standard aerobic conditions. Post anoxia, Col-0 and cax3 mutants displayed significantly greater cell death throughout the leaves, compared to cax1 (Figure 4D), which also showed greater survival at the whole plant level. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Effect of mutations in CAX genes on post-anoxia production of reactive oxygen species. A, Col-0 and cax3 displayed higher induction of lipid peroxidation as measured by MDA. Plants belonging to nine-rosette leaf stage were treated as described in Figure 1B and aerial portions of the plants were sampled 1 h and 8 after returning to normoxia conditions. Plants sampled prior to the anoxic conditions were used as controls. All results are means ± sem, n = 3. Asterisk indicate significant differences compared to pre-anoxia conditions at P < 0.01, as calculated from Student’s t test in Excel. B, Reduced H2O2 in cax1 compared to Col-0 and cax3 when recovering from anoxia as measured via DAB staining. A dark brown precipitate indicates the presence of H2O2. Whole rosettes from 3-week-old plants were exposed to anoxic conditions for 7 h. Rosettes were sampled 36 h after the plants were brought back to normoxia growth conditions. Unstressed plants were used as the control. Although there is variability among plants of the same genotype, the results were consistent. These data are representative of more than three independent experiments. C, Col-0 and cax3 plants demonstrated elevated H2O2 fluorescence using the cell permeable dye H2DCFDA in rosette leaves post anoxia compared to cax1. In the presence of ROS, H2DCF is oxidized to DCF, giving the fluorescence in Col-0 and cax3. Three-week-old plants were exposed to anoxic conditions for 8 h in dark. Following anoxia stress, mature whole rosette leaves were detached from the plants and were used for staining, Scale bar = 250 µM. Fluorescence signals quantified by ImageJ are given in the lower panel. Asterisks indicate significant differences compared to pre-anoxic conditions using Student’s t test in Excel (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.005). Although there is variability among plants, the trends were consistent. Data are a representative three independent experiments and error bars indicate standard error of the mean. D, Cell death in leaves as measured by trypan blue staining was higher in Col-0 and cax3 post anoxia compared to cax1. Plants belonging to nine-rosette leaf stage were subject to anoxia as described in Figure 1A and leaves were sampled 7 h after the plants were returned to normoxia. Nine leaves were used to quantify the cell death intensity. The letters indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between two columns (level of significance 95%) as calculated from Student’s t test in Excel. Error bars indicate standard error from mean. RNA-sequencing reveals cax1 changes in transcripts during anoxia and post-anoxia To identify molecular processes contributing to the observed difference between the sensitive lines (Col-0, cax3) and the tolerant line (cax1-1), the leaves of 21-day-old plants (nine-rosette leaf stage) were subject to RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis before, during, and after anoxic conditions (Safavi-Rizi et al., XXXX). Leaves were harvested from plants at the start of the treatment (0-h control-pre), after being in the anoxia chamber for 4 h (anoxia) and 1-h post 7-h anoxia treatment (post-anoxia; Figure 5). Each library consisted of at least 38 million reads mapped to the Col-0 genome. A large number of genes responded significantly to both treatments (anoxia and post-anoxia; Supplemental Figure S3). In Col-0, 5,292 genes were upregulated during anoxia, while 6,216 genes were downregulated. Post anoxia, 5,025 genes were upregulated and 5,050 genes downregulated (Supplemental Figure S3A). Enriched gene ontology (GO) categories for the genes up- and downregulated demonstrates that the anoxic conditions resulted in responses similar to those from previous hypoxia studies (van Veen et al., 2016; Yeung et al., 2018; Supplemental Tables S1–S12 and Supplemental Figure S4). Treatments and mutants clearly clustered separately in a principal component analysis (PCA) plot showing the first and second PCs which together explained 56.4% of variances, suggesting the RNA-seq was likely revealing differences between responses in the various genotypes (Figure 5A). We validated the RNA-seq data for several of the genes using reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR; Supplemental Figure S5). Figure 5. Open in a new tab CAX mutants transcriptome-wide responses to anoxia. A, PCA representation of Col-0, cax1, and cax3 transcriptomes before, during, and after anoxic treatment. B, GO groups identified in cax1 pre-anoxia that overlap with genes differentially expressed in col-0 and cax3 during anoxia (4-h) and post anoxia (1 h post 7-h anoxia). C, Bar graph denotes the upregulated HRGs downstream to ERFVII in pre-anoxic conditions. D, Substantially differential expression GO groups specifically found in cax1 after 4 h of anoxia. E, Preferential upregulation of genes involved in photosystem maintenance and cax1 following anoxia. F, Preferential upregulation of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism in cax1 following anoxia. Fold change expression of the genes were used for constructing heat map using MeV_4_9_0 in both (c) and (F). G, Substantially differential expression GO groups specifically found in cax1 during post-anoxic conditions. H, Scheme and timing of leaf tissue harvesting for RNA-seq analysis. Plants belonging to nine rosette leaf stage were taken for RNA-seq analysis before anoxia (pre-conditions), after 4 h of anoxia (anoxia), and 1 h after a 7-h anoxia treatment (post anoxia).We posited that enhanced expression or repression of specific genes prior to the stress could prime cax1 for tolerance (cax1 1,423 genes upregulated–146 genes downregulated; cax3 526 genes upregulated–167 downregulated; Figure 5; Supplemental Figure S3B and Supplemental Tables S13–S15). We thus asked if any of the genes highly differentially expressed in cax1 in conditions (Figure 5B) were genes highly differentially expressed in Col-0 during anoxic or post-anoxic conditions (Supplemental Figure S6 and Supplemental Tables S15–S21). This proved to be true. Of the 1,423 genes upregulated in cax1 pre-anoxia, ∼50% of these genes (717) were upregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia (Supplemental Figure S6A and Supplemental Table S16). The gene concept network indicates that specifically up- and downregulated genes could be assigned to different clusters. The upregulated genes appear to be involved in root morphogenesis and cellular response to hypoxia (Supplemental Figure S6B). Only 34 genes were downregulated in cax1 with 80% (Kong et al., 2020) of these downregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia. These overlapping genes appeared to be involved in cold acclimation and photosynthesis (Supplemental Figure S6, C and S6D and Supplemental Table S17). Meanwhile, the sensitive cax3 line displayed 141 genes upregulated during normoxia and 33% (41 genes) were upregulated in Col-0 with many of these overlapping genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and root morphogenesis (Supplemental Figure S6, I and S6J and Supplemental Table S18). In terms of downregulated genes, 32 genes in cax3 were downregulated during normoxia, and 66% (Wang et al., 2016) were also downregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia. These overlapping genes were involved in cold acclimation, defense responses, and leaf senescence (Supplemental Figure S6, K and S6L and Supplemental Table S19). Some of the ERF-VIIs target genes were expressed in cax1 prior to the stress (Figure 5, B and C). These ERF-VIIs are plant-specific transcription factors that are important regulators of low oxygen tolerance (Gibbs et al., 2015). Previously, a core hypoxia-specific gene set (n ≈ 49) have been identified that are primary targets of ERF-VIIs (Mustroph et al., 2009; Gasch et al., 2016). In cax1, 17 of these genes were substantially expressed at a higher level in cax1 even under aerobic conditions, indicating that the altered Ca homeostasis in cax1 influences the ERF-VII-dependent gene expression, even prior to anoxia stress (Figure 5C; Supplemental Table S20); in contrast, cax3 expressed only four of these genes at high levels prior to the stress (Figure 5C; Supplemental Table S20). This observation is consistent with the concept that cax1 is primed for low-oxygen environments during normal growth conditions. However, analysis of the expression of all the 49 core anaerobic genes revealed a marked dampening of the expression of these HRGs during anoxia (Figure 5D; Supplemental Figure S7). Indeed, cax1-1 only showed a modest induction of most of the 49 core HRGs, indicating that CAX1 is required to ensure a normal expression of the ERF-VII-dependent HRGs. This suggests that the tolerance to anoxia and submergence observed in cax1-1 may not be mediated by the ERF-VII-dependent pathway. During the anoxia phase, cax1-1 also displayed heightened expression of metabolic and photosystem genes (cax1 2,000 genes upregulated–2,225 downregulated; Figure 5, D–F; Supplemental Figure S3B). Apparently, the loss of CAX1 caused substantial changes in the way the plant manages depleted light and energy levels. To investigate cax1-1 anoxia tolerance more thoroughly during the stress, 141 and 586 unique (not found in either cax3 or Col-0) up- and downregulated were submitted for GO enrichment analysis (Supplemental Tables S21 and S22 and Supplemental Figure S8). The genes clustered with oxidative stress, defense responses, and nitrogen and hydrocarbon metabolic processes (Figure 5D). In contrast, genes involved in cell signaling, response to photooxidative stress, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, were downregulated (Supplemental Figure S8B). These may be related to downregulated genes for plastid organization and chloroplast organization, which likely results in suppressed carbohydrate metabolism (Supplemental Figures S9 and S10). The cluster response to oxidative stress were connected to a number of genes that showed both up- and downregulation during anoxia. To further conceptualize the cax1 anoxia tolerance recovery phase (cax1 1,432 genes upregulated–2,464 downregulated), 131 and 751 unique (not found in either cax3 or Col-0) up- and downregulated genes were also submitted for GO enrichment analysis (Supplemental Figure S3B and Supplemental Tables S23 and S24). The enriched GO category for these genes post-anoxia were predominately auxin-responsive genes, response to red light, and diterpenoid metabolism (Figure 5G). Meanwhile, the enriched GO category post-anoxia downregulated genes were cell wall biogenesis, anion transport, development, and cell growth related (Supplemental Figure S8C). Protein changes in cax1 post anoxia To provide additional insight into how the CAX proteins are involved in anoxia responses, global changes in protein abundance between Col-0, cax1, and cax3, pre- and post-anoxia were analyzed. In total, among the three genotypes, 463 unique proteins were identified from a total of 17,339 spectra. Normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) (Zybailov et al., 2006) of each protein served as the basis for PCA. Clear separations were shown for clusters in accordance with genotypes and treatments represented by 95% confidence ellipses from three biological replicates, with only slight overlap between the clusters of Col-0 and cax1 proteome post anoxia (Figure 6A). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Proteomic analysis of cax1 post-anoxia treatment. A, PCA of the proteome of Col-0, cax1, and cax3 pre (p) and post anoxia (a) conditions. Sample scores for the first and second principal components were plotted, the explained percentage of variance of PC1 and PC2 are indicated along the x and y axes. Clusters corresponding to the groups are represented by 95% confidence ellipses and include data from three biological replicates. The enlarged dots represent the means of the groups.

D, A combined GO enrichment study of transcriptomic and proteomic regulations in cax1 post-anoxia treatment. Each GO term is represented by a circle, and different groups are shown. The size of the GO term circle reflects the number of genes/proteins enriched in the corresponding item. T-up/down, enriched GO terms for significantly up/downregulated transcripts; P-increased/decreased, enriched GO terms for significantly increased/decreased proteins.A total of 242, 218, and 356 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified for Col-0, cax1, and cax3 post-anoxia treatment, respectively, based on their relative abundance, with details of increased and decreased proteins in each of the genotypes listed in Supplemental Table S25. DAPs in all three lines were subjected to enrichment analysis based on the functional annotation of GO terms. The top 20 significantly enriched GO terms (padj < 0.05, Bonferroni method) for increased and decreased proteins in all three lines (represented by different colors) are presented in Figure 6, B and C. The results suggested that increased proteins in all three lines were enriched in GO terms, including response to metal ion, photosynthesis, carbohydrate, and small molecule metabolic process, organic acid metabolic process, and sulfur compound metabolic process, while increased proteins from only cax1 and cax3 were enriched in carbon fixation, reductive pentose-phosphate cycle, and photosynthesis dark reaction (Figure 6B). In contrast, these GO terms were specifically enriched in Col-0 for proteins that had decreased abundance (Figure 6C). This is likely related to the decrease in proteins related to the GO term, chlorophyll metabolic processes, in this line which was also detected in the analysis as shown in Figure 6C. In addition, although decreased proteins in all three lines were enriched in GO terms for translational elongation, only Col-0 showed enrichment in decreased proteins for GO terms related to protein modification, such as peptidyl-amino acid modifications and protein nitrosylation (Figure 6C). GO enrichment analyses of significantly decreased proteins in cax1, and cax3 post anoxia also showed different clustering. For example, decreased proteins in cax1 were enriched for processes including response to stimulus and ribosome biogenesis, while decreased proteins in cax3 were enriched for metabolic processes (Figure 6C). A combined GO enrichment analysis of significantly altered transcripts and proteins provided insight into coordinated regulation occurring in cax1 post-anoxia treatment and is demonstrated by overlapping of clusters of significantly enriched GO terms (Figure 6D; Supplemental Figure S11). This highlighted processes such as increased energy metabolism, represented by generation of precursor metabolites, energy derivation by the oxidation of organic compounds, as well as an increase in oxidative scavenging shown as response to oxidative stress, response to reactive oxygen species, and response to hydrogen peroxide in cax1 post anoxia (Figure 6D; Supplemental Figure S11). Worth mentioning is that although proteomic analysis captured a decreased response to environmental stimulus such as chemical stress and salt stress (Figure 6, C and D), both transcriptomic and proteomic studies demonstrated an enrichment in GO terms for response to temperature (heat and cold) in cax1 post anoxia. Changes in cytosolic Ca levels at the onset of anoxia and during recovery from anoxia in cax1 Ca plays an important role in plant sensing of external signals (Sanders et al., 2002). CAX mutants may alter the distribution of Ca and thus influence anoxia responses. In order to investigate the relationship between CAX1 function and changes in cytosolic Ca and anoxia tolerance, we generated stable Col-0, cax3, and cax1 lines expressing the Ca biosensor GCaMP3, a GFP-based fluorescent protein made Ca2+-sensitive by the insertion of a calmodulin domain (Toyota et al., 2018). Under normal growth conditions, without anoxia stress, the Ca signals in Col-0 and cax1 were similar (Supplemental Figure S12). After 4 h of anoxia treatment, these lines were reoxygenated and imaged for their cytosolic Ca signature. In this assay, it took ∼15–30 s to unseal the container and begin the imaging, once the imaging progressed, Col-0 lines showed a prominent initial Ca signal which dissipated within 90 s (Figure 7; Supplemental Movie 1); a second less prominent Ca signal peaked around 200- 300-s post reoxygenation depending on the organ monitored. In cax1, the initial cytosolic Ca signal seen to decline over the initial 90 s in the Col-0 was absent. Meanwhile, a stronger Ca signal peaked at around 100–200 s, which was especially evident in the younger leaves and meristematic region (Figure 7; Supplemental Movie 1). The spatial distribution of the signal also changed: the second Ca signal appeared to have a more pronounced temporal and spatial progression in cax1 moving from the base of the meristem of the rosette along the petiole and into the leaf blade of the leaves. Although it is tempting to speculate that this represents a wave of response propagating outwards through the leaves, it is important to note that the reoxygenation post anoxia occurs plant wide and so these dynamics could equally report temporal differences in Ca signal generation in different parts of the plant.

Initial assessment for the roles of Ca signaling, ROS, and vacuolar function on anoxia tolerance Previous studies on anoxia stress responses (Loreti and Perata, 2020) and our RNA-seq, proteomics, and Ca imaging suggest anoxia tolerance may involve vacuolar function, Ca signaling, pH homeostasis, and signaling pathways similar to those involved in abiotic and biotic stresses (Voesenek et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2018). To further investigate the roles of these processes, we assessed various T-DNA insertion lines with alterations in vacuolar function, pH homeostasis, Ca transport, stress, and ROS signaling for anoxia tolerance (Table 1; Supplemental Figure S13). Using a simple visual screen, lines with altered expression of a tonoplast localized Ca-ATPase (Geisler et al., 2000), Na/H transporters (Reguera et al., 2015), and V-ATPase (Kriegel et al., 2015) displayed no changes in anoxia tolerance (Table 1; Supplemental Figure S13). Additionally, mutations in genes related to Ca signaling, ROS, and defense signaling, despite showing changes in gene expression in cax1, had loss-of-function phenotypes that closely resembled Col-0 (Supplemental Table 26).

    "discussion": "Discussion Hypoxia exerts a negative impact on energy production (Atwell et al., 2015). Hypoxic events can be viewed as a sequential, compound stress, where both the lack of oxygen and the reoxygenation periods pose distinct stressors; lack of light exerts another stress, eventually leading to carbon starvation (Loreti et al., 2018). Tolerance is determined by the plant’s ability to acclimate to all these stresses (Yeung et al., 2018). Plants may use spatial and temporal dynamics in Ca to convey information about anoxic conditions (Farnese et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). Here, we identified CAX1 as a Ca transporter whose expression is detrimental to anoxic conditions and submergence (Figures 1 and 2). Using this mutant, we have sought to identify various molecular and physiological processes influencing anoxia tolerance. Our work suggests that cax1 has numerous adaptations to endure anoxia stress (Figure 8): (1) The plant is primed for anoxia through altered expression of ROS, HRGs, and temperature perception genes (Figures 4 and 5; Supplemental Figures S6 and S13 and Supplemental Table S20); (2) During anoxia, changes in light and carbohydrate metabolism may mitigate the stress (Figures 5 and 6); (3) Post anoxia, altered Ca signaling could help dissipate the reoxygenation stress (Figure 7). These findings suggest that altered tonoplast H+/Ca transport impacts an array of biological processes associated with anoxia (Figures 4, 5, 6 and 8); however, mutants in tonoplast localized Ca transporters with different transport kinetics did not impact anoxia tolerance (Table 1). The loss of high-capacity low-affinity Ca transport caused by disruption of CAX1 led to numerous changes in gene expression and protein abundance; the breadth of these changes makes the identification of a single causative pathway for this submergence/anoxia tolerance a challenging endeavor. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Model comparing pre-anoxia and anoxia responses in CAX1 and cax1 lines. Before anoxia, plants appear to have altered regulation of ERF-VII-targeted transcripts and stress response genes such as those involved in systemic-acquired resistance (SAR). During anoxia and post anoxia, cax1 appears to have dampened ROS production, altered (Δ)Ca signaling, and differences in the expression of carbohydrate and metabolism genes. The fact that a subset of HRGs is upregulated in normoxia in cax1, while most of the HRGs are downregulated during hypoxia is intriguing. This suggests that altered Ca homeostasis caused by perturbed CAX1 activates some HRGs, most likely though an ERF-VII-independent pathway, given that this class of transcription factors are highly unstable and thus inactive under aerobic conditions (Weits et al., 2014). Under hypoxia, instead, ERF-VII are stable because of the inability of plant cysteine oxidases to utilize molecular oxygen (Weits et al., 2014). Under these conditions, which promote a vigorous expression of ERF-VII-dependent HRGs, we observed a dampening of the response, which could be beneficial to preserve the carbon reserves required during the recovery phase. Monitoring the protein stability of ERF-VII (e.g. by western blot) as a consequence of CAX1-dependent alterations in Ca fluxes could be difficult but could shed light on the role of Ca on the stability of ERF-VII. Furthermore, future experiments with erfVII/cax1 will be informative to define whether the tolerance in cax1 requires the activity of ERF-VIIs or it is an ERF-VII-independent mechanism of tolerance. As the lack of a waterlogging phenotypes demonstrates, plant roots and shoots have different mechanisms for hypoxia/anoxia stress tolerance (Ellis et al., 1999). Previous work in Arabidopsis has used tissue-specific root ion profiling to show roles of putative CAXs and Ca-ATPase transporters in hypoxia (Wang et al., 2016). These studies demonstrated a gene termed CCX5 (misidentified as CAX11) was involved in hypoxia responses; 3 weeks of waterlogging resulted in dramatic loss of shoot biomass in ccx5 (cax11) plants. It is important to clarify here that CCX5 is not a CAX (Shigaki et al., 2006) and is more closely related to mammalian K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ antiporters (Pittman and Hirschi, 2016). Our results showed that the leaf-expressed CAX1 is detrimental for both anoxia and submergence tolerance (Figures 1 and 2). Furthermore, the expression of CAX1 in cax1-1 suppressed these tolerance phenotypes (Figures 1 and 2). Waterlogging, which results in hypoxia restricted to the root system, provided support to the role of CAX1 limited to the aerial part of the plant (Figure 3). Additionally, CAX3 does not appear to be required for hypoxia signaling given that cax3 remained sensitive to both submergence and waterlogging. In cax1, signaling and metabolic mechanisms for anoxia tolerance are activated, suggesting that CAX1 plays a negative role in low oxygen tolerance (Figure 8). However, the mechanism by which the absence of this transporter positively impacts multiple biochemical mechanisms toward tolerance requires further research. In yeast, the tonoplast localized Ca/H+ antiporter, VCX1, functions to rapidly sequester cytosolic Ca and attenuate the activation of Ca signaling pathways (Miseta et al., 1999). However, the relationship between Ca signaling and CAX1 during limited oxygen conditions is less clear. Defining this relationship is confounded by the variable Ca responses among leaves within the same plant. This work focused on the two older leaves in the four-leaf rosette stage in young plants, where the changes between cax1 and Col-0 were most obvious. In cax1, during the first minute after exposure to oxygen, plants appeared to accumulate less cytosolic Ca in these leaves (Figure 7). One interpretation of this observation is that CAX1 has a minimal role in sequestering cytosolic Ca during this response as its loss would be expected to cause a larger Ca increase if it was removing signaling-related Ca from the cytosol. Indeed, such an increase in the magnitude of the pathogen elicitor-triggered Ca signal is seen when the two tonoplasts localized Ca2+-ATPases ACA4 and ACA 11 are knocked out, providing evidence that for these two pumps, they do normally act to attenuate the Ca signal (Hilleary et al., 2020). From our results, it seems likely that CAX1 is instead functioning to create an exchangeable Ca store that can be drawn upon to generate signals, and this is lost in the mutant. Alternatively, cax1 may cause compensatory upregulation of numerous endomembrane Ca transporters to diminish cytosolic Ca levels (Cheng et al., 2003, 2005). In yeast, the absence of Vcx1p results in heightened Ca-ATPase expression (Callewaert et al., 2020) and may result in the induction or activation of a set of transporters capable of coupling vacuolar Ca uptake to the vacuolar H+ gradient (Miseta et al., 1999). Indeed, our analyses reveal significant (P < 0.01) constitutive transcriptional upregulation to more than two-fold of some classic Ca transporters including ACAs 1 and 9–13 in the cax1 background and as noted above, ACA11 is thought to act to attenuate Ca signaling (Hilleary et al., 2020). We also cannot discount activation of another transport system, or post-translational regulation of, for example the ACAs or CAXs playing an important role in these processes. Caution regarding ascribing any direct mechanistic relationship between cax1-mediated Ca levels and anoxia tolerance is also warranted. For example, the phenotype of anoxia tolerance displayed in the mutant could be caused by heightened H+ pumping. For adequate energy production, residual H+ pumping is critical to cope with anoxia by importing energy-rich compounds (Felle, 2005). The perturbation of Arabidopsis H+-ATPase activities at both the plasma membrane and tonoplast in mutants lacking tonoplast Ca/H+ antiporters (Pittman et al., 2005; Barkla et al., 2008) suggests future studies that address how cax1 impacts transmembrane H+ gradients during oxygen limiting conditions (Reguera et al., 2015). This information may provide important insight into the molecular events underlying cax1 tolerance. A limitation of our model (Figure 8) is its inability to address the known variability in anoxic responses among different tissues and leaves (Banti et al., 2013; Klecker et al., 2014; Ventura et al., 2020). These differences were seen here in both the ROS and Ca imaging experiments (Figures 4 and 7). While the anoxic response is variable, the role of CAX1 in different tissues and leaves also fluctuates. In dicots, CAX1 is found predominately in the tonoplast of mesophyll cells (Conn et al., 2011). Each tissue will have a different proportion of mesophyll cells, and individual cells will have variations in vacuole size and shape (Tan et al., 2019). Thus, there will be developmental and spatial differences in the contribution of CAX1 to Ca and H+ fluxes. For example, in contrast to the major mesophyll expression observed in dicots, in monocots CAX1 is localized to epidermal cells (Conn et al., 2011), we posit monocot loss-of-function mutants will show very different responses to anoxic conditions. Loss-of-function mutations in Arabidopsis H+/Ca transporter CAX1 display a robust conditional phenotype, they gain tolerance to anoxic conditions (Figure 1). The disruption of CAX transport during this stress impacts a myriad of cellular processes: cell wall biosynthesis, metabolism, ROS, hormone, and Ca signaling (Figure 5). Furthermore, the mutants appear to be primed for the stress by having heightened expression of ROS-related transcripts and diminished expression of cold tolerance genes during normal growth conditions (Figure 4; Supplemental Figure S6). The cax1 lines also appear to be “warmed up” as they display heightened expression of heat-responsive transcripts during the anoxia recovery phase (Supplemental Figure S14). Heat shock response involves the induction of a wide range of molecular chaperones to aid in protecting and refolding damaged proteins and so this constitutive production of, for example heat shock proteins may equip cax1 with readymade machinery to cope with some of the cellular damage that anoxia and reoxygenation imposes. Previous work has also shown that cax1 has altered cold-acclimation responses (Catalá et al., 2003) and temperature perception may be an important factor in our anoxia tolerance phenotype.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions This study adds granularity to the role of tonoplast localized Ca transport in plant stress responses. The cax1-mediated anoxia tolerance is caused by extensive changes in both metabolism and signaling. Indeed, one of the most important findings of this study is the breath and amplitude of changes caused by the loss of a single tonoplast H+/Ca transporter (Figures 5 and 6). To harness this knowledge for translational applications, judicious application is advised: CAX transporters impact a variety of plant signal transduction pathways (Pittman and Hirschi, 2016; Bradshaw, 2005; Baliardini et al., 2015, 2016). However, the CAX transporters appear to be autoinhibited, requiring a protein partner for activation (Shigaki and Hirschi, 2006). During anoxic conditions, CAX1 may be activated by a specific regulatory protein and downregulation of this activator during anoxic conditions may be a means of transiently impairing CAX1 function and improving anoxia tolerance.",

Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood. Four functional cation/proton exchangers (CAX1–4) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) help regulate Ca homeostasis around the vacuole. Our results demonstrate that cax1 mutants are more tolerant to both anoxic conditions and submergence. Using phenotypic measurements, RNA-sequencing, and proteomic approaches, we identified cax1-mediated anoxia changes that phenocopy changes present in anoxia-tolerant crops: altered metabolic processes, diminished reactive oxygen species production post anoxia, and altered hormone signaling. Comparing wild-type and cax1 expressing genetically encoded Ca indicators demonstrated altered cytosolic Ca signals in cax1 during reoxygenation. Anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole are involved in the control of numerous signaling events related to adaptation to low oxygen stress. This work suggests that cax1 anoxia response pathway could be engineered to circumvent the adverse effects of flooding that impair production agriculture. Plants lacking a vacuolar H+/Ca transporter are more tolerant to anoxia and submergence.Introduction Plants are frequently exposed to limited oxygen availability, influencing plant growth and, in an agricultural context, plant productivity (Loreti et al., 2016; Pedersen et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2018). The lack of oxygen (anoxia) reduces plant energy production (Rawyler et al., 2002). To survive and limit post-anoxic injuries, plants often regulate the flow of the little energy produced under stress conditions to essential processes (Blokhina et al., 2001; Virolainen et al., 2002; Huang et al., 2008; Atwell et al., 2015). In a natural context, submergence leads to multiple abiotic stress-related constraints, including limited light availability and the occurrence of oxidative stress either during or after the period of hypoxic conditions (Sasidharan et al., 2018). Plants respond to submergence by responding to ethylene, which accumulates in plant tissues because of the lower underwater gas diffusion rate. The perception and response to cellular oxygen (O2) levels per se is mediated by a subset of ethylene response factors (ERFs) belonging to the group VII of this large class of transcription factors (ERF-VII; Gibbs et al., 2015). ERF-VIIs induce a set of genes which are required to adapt plant metabolism and growth during low O2 conditions (Paul et al., 2016). Calcium (Ca) signaling is another, less studied, component of plant responses to hypoxia (Igamberdiev and Hill, 2018; Huang et al., 2022). Ca signaling was proposed to control the induction of hypoxia-responsive genes (HRGs) and this would imply a cross-talk of this signaling pathway with the ERF-VII-dependent regulation of HRGs (Subbaiah et al., 1994), although this is not yet been demonstrated. In response to changes in O2 levels, Ca signaling differs among plants, with marked differences between Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) in the spatiotemporal parameters of the observed Ca signatures (Bailey-Serres and Chang, 2005; Behera et al., 2015). Ca signaling differences appear to precede gene expression differences and metabolic fluxes, although precisely how Ca is triggering downstream events remains unclear (Schmidt et al., 2018). Conceptualizing signaling events involved in anoxia perception and tolerance might be useful to improve plant performance both during and after anoxic conditions. Ca is at the nexus between many facets of plant biology (Ali et al., 2007; Ma and Berkowitz, 2007; Choi et al., 2017; Costa et al., 2018; Demidchik et al., 2018). Ca transporters on various membranes help to orchestrate responses to stresses such as changes in temperature and anoxia (Catalá et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2017; Costa et al., 2018; Weigand et al., 2021). Ca pumps and exchangers are found in multiple membrane systems, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), vacuole, and plasma membrane (PM; Blumwald and Poole, 1986). Ca pumps are considered low-capacity, high-affinity efflux systems, but within this broad group of transporters, H+/Ca eXchangers (CAXs) are distinct because they have high capacity and low affinity (Kong et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020). While both Ca pumps and CAXs remove Ca from the cytoplasm, their individual contributions to the control of the magnitude or duration of different stimulus-specific Ca signals remains enigmatic. There are six CAXs in Arabidopsis, but only CAX1–4 are expressed and appear to be predominately localized to the vacuole (Manohar et al., 2011). CAX2 and CAX4 are expressed at lower levels in plants, and most of the research on Ca signaling and homeostasis in plants has focused on the more highly expressed CAX1 and CAX3 (29). CAX1 is expressed in aerial tissue and is the dominant mechanism for Ca accumulation in the leaf (Conn et al., 2011; Whitt et al., 2020); CAX3 is primarily expressed in the roots (Hocking et al., 2017). The absence of CAX1 induces ectopic expression of other CAXs, which is often sufficient to maintain mesophyll cellular uptake of Ca from the apoplast (Cheng et al., 2005). The numerous cax1 lines characterized have subtle phenotypes throughout their life cycle and are virtually indistinguishable from controls in normal growth conditions (Manohar et al., 2011). These subtle phenotypes could be due to the interplay between CAX transporters and other transporters; deletions in CAX1 reduce vacuolar H+/Ca antiport activity by 50%, decrease vacuolar V-type proton ATPase activity by 40% and increase vacuolar Ca-ATPase activity by 36% (Cheng et al., 2003). Plant responses to hypoxia and anoxia have been extensively studied (Atwell et al., 2015; Voesenek and Bailey-Serres, 2013; Voesenek et al., 2016); however, less is known about the contribution of Ca signaling processes governing a plant’s tolerance to low oxygen. Traditional approaches to study these events include differential gene expression studies and comparative genomic analysis (Yeung et al., 2018). Here, our analysis focuses on CAX1, a gene that is neither highly expressed during oxygen stress conditions nor thought to be modified in plants adapted to oxygen limitations. We demonstrate that cax1 plants are extremely tolerant to anoxia conditions and submergence. We established that during post anoxia, cax1 showed reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; additionally, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed cax1 plants displayed apparent changes in transcripts and proteins for Ca transport and numerous signaling pathways. We also investigated how cax1 changed the amplitude and duration of Ca signals during reoxygenation. Our work highlights a central role of tonoplast localized H+/Ca2+ transport in anoxia responses while further defining the molecular choreography of anoxia signaling.Results CAX1 mediates tolerance to anoxia and submergence Multiple studies have shown that Ca-regulated transporters and proteins like calmodulin demonstrate modified expression during conditions of low O2 (Otsuka et al., 2010; Lokdarshi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). We sought to clarify the role of CAX genes in anoxia tolerance using a seedling survival assay where plants are exposed to anoxic conditions for a period of time and survival monitored upon return to normoxic conditions (ambient air, i.e. ∼21% O2). In our assay, 21-day-old plants (nine rosette leaf development stage (Boyes et al., 2001) were placed in a GasPack anaerobic system that reduced O2 levels in the experimental chamber to ∼0% (Supplemental Figure S1A). After anoxia, phenotypes of the cax lines relative to Col-0 plants were well-defined: the cax1 lines (both cax1-1 and cax1-2) were more tolerant to anoxic conditions and this phenotype was clearly visible 4 days after being removed from the anoxic chamber (Figure 1A). Chlorophyll loss measurements were made to compare the damage during reoxygenation among the tolerant and susceptible lines. At 24-h and 48-h post-anoxia, Col-0 and cax3 displayed more chlorophyll loss, while both cax1 alleles maintained their leaf chlorophyll content (Figure 1B; Liang et al., 2017). After these anoxic conditions, >80% of the cax1 plants remained alive, whereas <15% of the cax3 and Col-0 grew to maturity (Supplemental Figure S1, B and S1C). This tolerance was lost when CAX1 driven by the CAX1 promoter region was expressed in cax1-1 (Figure 1C; Supplemental Figure S1D). Again, this susceptibility was verified by the loss of chlorophyll (Figure 1D). cax2, cax3, and cax4 had instead similar anoxia phenotypes as Col-0 (Supplemental Figure S1E). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Arabidopsis cax1 lines are anoxia tolerant. A, Enhanced anoxia tolerance in cax1-1 and cax1-2 compared to Col-0 and cax3. Twenty-one-day-old plants (nine-rosette leaf stage) were placed in a GasPack Anaerobic system. After 8 h, plants were returned to normoxia conditions and photographed after 4 days. Photographs represent more than 15 biological replicates in each condition. B, Post anoxia cax1 exhibited less chlorophyll loss than Col-0 and cax3. Plants belonging to nine-rosette leaf stage were treated as described in Figure 1B and aerial portions of the plants were sampled 24 and 48 h after returning to normoxia conditions. Plants sampled prior to the anoxic conditions were used as controls. All results are means ± sem, n = 3 and error bars indicate standard error of the mean. Individual data points represented with a gray circle and asterisk indicate significant difference from the pre-treatment conditions at P =0.01, as calculated from Student’s t test in Excel.

The increase in CAX1 expression in the transgenic lines has been confirmed by RT–qPCR as shown in Supplemental Figure S1E. Assay conditions similar to those described in (B) and (C).We investigated if knockingout CAX1 resulted in enhanced tolerance to submergence and waterlogging in adult Arabidopsis plants grown in soil. Although cax1 growth rate was initially reduced compared to the Col-0, it reached a similar size when grown in air. When plants were submerged for 48 h, followed by 7 days of aerobic recovery, Col-0 plants displayed stunted growth (Figure 2A; Supplemental Figure S2), indicating that the length of oxygen deprivation was long enough to severely affect the ability of the plants to recover from the stress. Remarkably, cax1 was extremely tolerant to submergence, showing none of the symptoms of prolonged hypoxia, namely inability to recover from the submergence treatment and yellowing. Both these parameters were quantified utilizing a phenotyping setup (Ventura et al., 2020), as described in Figure 2, B and C. Similar to the Col-0, the cax3 mutant was also intolerant, as was a CAX1 complementation line (cax1:sCAX1 in cax1-1). Figure 2.

Outliers have been identified using GraphPad 8.0.1 software (Q = 0.1%) and removed from the plots.Next, we explored the possibility that mutations in CAX1 would also result in a tolerant phenotype to waterlogging, whereby only the root system is submerged. This is of interest, given that CAX1 is predominantly expressed in leaves and CAX3 in roots. The phenotype of all genotypes under waterlogging were similar, with enhanced anthocyanin synthesis in the leaves (Figure 3A). The growth of all genotypes stopped under waterlogging (Figure 3B). The size of cax1-1 plants was slightly smaller than the other genotypes under waterlogging (Figure 3C), while the leaf color of cax1-1 turned from red to yellowish (Figure 3D). Overall, while tolerance to submergence was greatly enhanced in cax1-1, CAX1 seems to have a limited role in oxygen deprivation when it is restricted to the root system. Figure 3.

Oxidative-stress-induced lipid peroxidation (by malondialdehyde measurement in leaves) was elevated in Col-0 and cax3 at 8-h post-anoxia, but both cax1 lines displayed lower lipid peroxidation (Figure 4A; Sattler et al., 2006). Since ROS are important signal molecules mediating plant stress responses and have been closely linked to hypoxia response (Chapman et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021), staining with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was performed (Daudi and O'Brien, 2012). Although the leaves often varied in their responses, the cax1 lines consistently showed lower H2O2 accumulation (Figure 4B). We also measured hydrogen peroxide levels using the cell permeable dye H2DCFDA in plants exposed to anoxic conditions or to normoxia (Fichman et al., 2019). Although there was also variability among the leaves, Col-0 and cax3 plants generally displayed elevated H2O2 post anoxia while cax1 displayed lower levels (Figure 4C). Trypan blue staining of seedlings was performed to investigate cell death during the anoxia stress response. We observed a mild degree of cell death in standard aerobic conditions. Post anoxia, Col-0 and cax3 mutants displayed significantly greater cell death throughout the leaves, compared to cax1 (Figure 4D), which also showed greater survival at the whole plant level. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Effect of mutations in CAX genes on post-anoxia production of reactive oxygen species. A, Col-0 and cax3 displayed higher induction of lipid peroxidation as measured by MDA. Plants belonging to nine-rosette leaf stage were treated as described in Figure 1B and aerial portions of the plants were sampled 1 h and 8 after returning to normoxia conditions. Plants sampled prior to the anoxic conditions were used as controls. All results are means ± sem, n = 3. Asterisk indicate significant differences compared to pre-anoxia conditions at P < 0.01, as calculated from Student’s t test in Excel. B, Reduced H2O2 in cax1 compared to Col-0 and cax3 when recovering from anoxia as measured via DAB staining. A dark brown precipitate indicates the presence of H2O2. Whole rosettes from 3-week-old plants were exposed to anoxic conditions for 7 h. Rosettes were sampled 36 h after the plants were brought back to normoxia growth conditions. Unstressed plants were used as the control. Although there is variability among plants of the same genotype, the results were consistent. These data are representative of more than three independent experiments. C, Col-0 and cax3 plants demonstrated elevated H2O2 fluorescence using the cell permeable dye H2DCFDA in rosette leaves post anoxia compared to cax1. In the presence of ROS, H2DCF is oxidized to DCF, giving the fluorescence in Col-0 and cax3. Three-week-old plants were exposed to anoxic conditions for 8 h in dark. Following anoxia stress, mature whole rosette leaves were detached from the plants and were used for staining, Scale bar = 250 µM. Fluorescence signals quantified by ImageJ are given in the lower panel. Asterisks indicate significant differences compared to pre-anoxic conditions using Student’s t test in Excel (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.005). Although there is variability among plants, the trends were consistent. Data are a representative three independent experiments and error bars indicate standard error of the mean. D, Cell death in leaves as measured by trypan blue staining was higher in Col-0 and cax3 post anoxia compared to cax1. Plants belonging to nine-rosette leaf stage were subject to anoxia as described in Figure 1A and leaves were sampled 7 h after the plants were returned to normoxia. Nine leaves were used to quantify the cell death intensity. The letters indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between two columns (level of significance 95%) as calculated from Student’s t test in Excel. Error bars indicate standard error from mean.RNA-sequencing reveals cax1 changes in transcripts during anoxia and post-anoxia To identify molecular processes contributing to the observed difference between the sensitive lines (Col-0, cax3) and the tolerant line (cax1-1), the leaves of 21-day-old plants (nine-rosette leaf stage) were subject to RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis before, during, and after anoxic conditions (Safavi-Rizi et al., XXXX). Leaves were harvested from plants at the start of the treatment (0-h control-pre), after being in the anoxia chamber for 4 h (anoxia) and 1-h post 7-h anoxia treatment (post-anoxia; Figure 5). Each library consisted of at least 38 million reads mapped to the Col-0 genome. A large number of genes responded significantly to both treatments (anoxia and post-anoxia; Supplemental Figure S3). In Col-0, 5,292 genes were upregulated during anoxia, while 6,216 genes were downregulated. Post anoxia, 5,025 genes were upregulated and 5,050 genes downregulated (Supplemental Figure S3A). Enriched gene ontology (GO) categories for the genes up- and downregulated demonstrates that the anoxic conditions resulted in responses similar to those from previous hypoxia studies (van Veen et al., 2016; Yeung et al., 2018; Supplemental Tables S1–S12 and Supplemental Figure S4). Treatments and mutants clearly clustered separately in a principal component analysis (PCA) plot showing the first and second PCs which together explained 56.4% of variances, suggesting the RNA-seq was likely revealing differences between responses in the various genotypes (Figure 5A). We validated the RNA-seq data for several of the genes using reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR; Supplemental Figure S5). Figure 5. Open in a new tab CAX mutants transcriptome-wide responses to anoxia. A, PCA representation of Col-0, cax1, and cax3 transcriptomes before, during, and after anoxic treatment. B, GO groups identified in cax1 pre-anoxia that overlap with genes differentially expressed in col-0 and cax3 during anoxia (4-h) and post anoxia (1 h post 7-h anoxia).

G, Substantially differential expression GO groups specifically found in cax1 during post-anoxic conditions. H, Scheme and timing of leaf tissue harvesting for RNA-seq analysis. Plants belonging to nine rosette leaf stage were taken for RNA-seq analysis before anoxia (pre-conditions), after 4 h of anoxia (anoxia), and 1 h after a 7-h anoxia treatment (post anoxia).We posited that enhanced expression or repression of specific genes prior to the stress could prime cax1 for tolerance (cax1 1,423 genes upregulated–146 genes downregulated; cax3 526 genes upregulated–167 downregulated; Figure 5; Supplemental Figure S3B and Supplemental Tables S13–S15). We thus asked if any of the genes highly differentially expressed in cax1 in conditions (Figure 5B) were genes highly differentially expressed in Col-0 during anoxic or post-anoxic conditions (Supplemental Figure S6 and Supplemental Tables S15–S21). This proved to be true. Of the 1,423 genes upregulated in cax1 pre-anoxia, ∼50% of these genes (717) were upregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia (Supplemental Figure S6A and Supplemental Table S16). The gene concept network indicates that specifically up- and downregulated genes could be assigned to different clusters. The upregulated genes appear to be involved in root morphogenesis and cellular response to hypoxia (Supplemental Figure S6B). Only 34 genes were downregulated in cax1 with 80% (Kong et al., 2020) of these downregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia. These overlapping genes appeared to be involved in cold acclimation and photosynthesis (Supplemental Figure S6, C and S6D and Supplemental Table S17). Meanwhile, the sensitive cax3 line displayed 141 genes upregulated during normoxia and 33% (41 genes) were upregulated in Col-0 with many of these overlapping genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and root morphogenesis (Supplemental Figure S6, I and S6J and Supplemental Table S18). In terms of downregulated genes, 32 genes in cax3 were downregulated during normoxia, and 66% (Wang et al., 2016) were also downregulated in Col-0 during or post anoxia. These overlapping genes were involved in cold acclimation, defense responses, and leaf senescence (Supplemental Figure S6, K and S6L and Supplemental Table S19). Some of the ERF-VIIs target genes were expressed in cax1 prior to the stress (Figure 5, B and C). These ERF-VIIs are plant-specific transcription factors that are important regulators of low oxygen tolerance (Gibbs et al., 2015). Previously, a core hypoxia-specific gene set (n ≈ 49) have been identified that are primary targets of ERF-VIIs (Mustroph et al., 2009; Gasch et al., 2016). In cax1, 17 of these genes were substantially expressed at a higher level in cax1 even under aerobic conditions, indicating that the altered Ca homeostasis in cax1 influences the ERF-VII-dependent gene expression, even prior to anoxia stress (Figure 5C; Supplemental Table S20); in contrast, cax3 expressed only four of these genes at high levels prior to the stress (Figure 5C; Supplemental Table S20). This observation is consistent with the concept that cax1 is primed for low-oxygen environments during normal growth conditions. However, analysis of the expression of all the 49 core anaerobic genes revealed a marked dampening of the expression of these HRGs during anoxia (Figure 5D; Supplemental Figure S7). Indeed, cax1-1 only showed a modest induction of most of the 49 core HRGs, indicating that CAX1 is required to ensure a normal expression of the ERF-VII-dependent HRGs. This suggests that the tolerance to anoxia and submergence observed in cax1-1 may not be mediated by the ERF-VII-dependent pathway. During the anoxia phase, cax1-1 also displayed heightened expression of metabolic and photosystem genes (cax1 2,000 genes upregulated–2,225 downregulated; Figure 5, D–F; Supplemental Figure S3B). Apparently, the loss of CAX1 caused substantial changes in the way the plant manages depleted light and energy levels. To investigate cax1-1 anoxia tolerance more thoroughly during the stress, 141 and 586 unique (not found in either cax3 or Col-0) up- and downregulated were submitted for GO enrichment analysis (Supplemental Tables S21 and S22 and Supplemental Figure S8). The genes clustered with oxidative stress, defense responses, and nitrogen and hydrocarbon metabolic processes (Figure 5D). In contrast, genes involved in cell signaling, response to photooxidative stress, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, were downregulated (Supplemental Figure S8B). These may be related to downregulated genes for plastid organization and chloroplast organization, which likely results in suppressed carbohydrate metabolism (Supplemental Figures S9 and S10). The cluster response to oxidative stress were connected to a number of genes that showed both up- and downregulation during anoxia. To further conceptualize the cax1 anoxia tolerance recovery phase (cax1 1,432 genes upregulated–2,464 downregulated), 131 and 751 unique (not found in either cax3 or Col-0) up- and downregulated genes were also submitted for GO enrichment analysis (Supplemental Figure S3B and Supplemental Tables S23 and S24). The enriched GO category for these genes post-anoxia were predominately auxin-responsive genes, response to red light, and diterpenoid metabolism (Figure 5G). Meanwhile, the enriched GO category post-anoxia downregulated genes were cell wall biogenesis, anion transport, development, and cell growth related (Supplemental Figure S8C).Protein changes in cax1 post anoxia To provide additional insight into how the CAX proteins are involved in anoxia responses, global changes in protein abundance between Col-0, cax1, and cax3, pre- and post-anoxia were analyzed. In total, among the three genotypes, 463 unique proteins were identified from a total of 17,339 spectra. Normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) (Zybailov et al., 2006) of each protein served as the basis for PCA. Clear separations were shown for clusters in accordance with genotypes and treatments represented by 95% confidence ellipses from three biological replicates, with only slight overlap between the clusters of Col-0 and cax1 proteome post anoxia (Figure 6A). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Proteomic analysis of cax1 post-anoxia treatment. A, PCA of the proteome of Col-0, cax1, and cax3 pre (p) and post anoxia (a) conditions. Sample scores for the first and second principal components were plotted, the explained percentage of variance of PC1 and PC2 are indicated along the x and y axes. Clusters corresponding to the groups are represented by 95% confidence ellipses and include data from three biological replicates. The enlarged dots represent the means of the groups.

D, A combined GO enrichment study of transcriptomic and proteomic regulations in cax1 post-anoxia treatment. Each GO term is represented by a circle, and different groups are shown. The size of the GO term circle reflects the number of genes/proteins enriched in the corresponding item. T-up/down, enriched GO terms for significantly up/downregulated transcripts; P-increased/decreased, enriched GO terms for significantly increased/decreased proteins.A total of 242, 218, and 356 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified for Col-0, cax1, and cax3 post-anoxia treatment, respectively, based on their relative abundance, with details of increased and decreased proteins in each of the genotypes listed in Supplemental Table S25. DAPs in all three lines were subjected to enrichment analysis based on the functional annotation of GO terms. The top 20 significantly enriched GO terms (padj < 0.05, Bonferroni method) for increased and decreased proteins in all three lines (represented by different colors) are presented in Figure 6, B and C. The results suggested that increased proteins in all three lines were enriched in GO terms, including response to metal ion, photosynthesis, carbohydrate, and small molecule metabolic process, organic acid metabolic process, and sulfur compound metabolic process, while increased proteins from only cax1 and cax3 were enriched in carbon fixation, reductive pentose-phosphate cycle, and photosynthesis dark reaction (Figure 6B). In contrast, these GO terms were specifically enriched in Col-0 for proteins that had decreased abundance (Figure 6C). This is likely related to the decrease in proteins related to the GO term, chlorophyll metabolic processes, in this line which was also detected in the analysis as shown in Figure 6C. In addition, although decreased proteins in all three lines were enriched in GO terms for translational elongation, only Col-0 showed enrichment in decreased proteins for GO terms related to protein modification, such as peptidyl-amino acid modifications and protein nitrosylation (Figure 6C). GO enrichment analyses of significantly decreased proteins in cax1, and cax3 post anoxia also showed different clustering. For example, decreased proteins in cax1 were enriched for processes including response to stimulus and ribosome biogenesis, while decreased proteins in cax3 were enriched for metabolic processes (Figure 6C). A combined GO enrichment analysis of significantly altered transcripts and proteins provided insight into coordinated regulation occurring in cax1 post-anoxia treatment and is demonstrated by overlapping of clusters of significantly enriched GO terms (Figure 6D; Supplemental Figure S11). This highlighted processes such as increased energy metabolism, represented by generation of precursor metabolites, energy derivation by the oxidation of organic compounds, as well as an increase in oxidative scavenging shown as response to oxidative stress, response to reactive oxygen species, and response to hydrogen peroxide in cax1 post anoxia (Figure 6D; Supplemental Figure S11). Worth mentioning is that although proteomic analysis captured a decreased response to environmental stimulus such as chemical stress and salt stress (Figure 6, C and D), both transcriptomic and proteomic studies demonstrated an enrichment in GO terms for response to temperature (heat and cold) in cax1 post anoxia.Changes in cytosolic Ca levels at the onset of anoxia and during recovery from anoxia in cax1 Ca plays an important role in plant sensing of external signals (Sanders et al., 2002). CAX mutants may alter the distribution of Ca and thus influence anoxia responses. In order to investigate the relationship between CAX1 function and changes in cytosolic Ca and anoxia tolerance, we generated stable Col-0, cax3, and cax1 lines expressing the Ca biosensor GCaMP3, a GFP-based fluorescent protein made Ca2+-sensitive by the insertion of a calmodulin domain (Toyota et al., 2018). Under normal growth conditions, without anoxia stress, the Ca signals in Col-0 and cax1 were similar (Supplemental Figure S12). After 4 h of anoxia treatment, these lines were reoxygenated and imaged for their cytosolic Ca signature. In this assay, it took ∼15–30 s to unseal the container and begin the imaging, once the imaging progressed, Col-0 lines showed a prominent initial Ca signal which dissipated within 90 s (Figure 7; Supplemental Movie 1); a second less prominent Ca signal peaked around 200- 300-s post reoxygenation depending on the organ monitored. In cax1, the initial cytosolic Ca signal seen to decline over the initial 90 s in the Col-0 was absent. Meanwhile, a stronger Ca signal peaked at around 100–200 s, which was especially evident in the younger leaves and meristematic region (Figure 7; Supplemental Movie 1). The spatial distribution of the signal also changed: the second Ca signal appeared to have a more pronounced temporal and spatial progression in cax1 moving from the base of the meristem of the rosette along the petiole and into the leaf blade of the leaves. Although it is tempting to speculate that this represents a wave of response propagating outwards through the leaves, it is important to note that the reoxygenation post anoxia occurs plant wide and so these dynamics could equally report temporal differences in Ca signal generation in different parts of the plant.

Representative of ≥10 independent plants.Initial assessment for the roles of Ca signaling, ROS, and vacuolar function on anoxia tolerance Previous studies on anoxia stress responses (Loreti and Perata, 2020) and our RNA-seq, proteomics, and Ca imaging suggest anoxia tolerance may involve vacuolar function, Ca signaling, pH homeostasis, and signaling pathways similar to those involved in abiotic and biotic stresses (Voesenek et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2018). To further investigate the roles of these processes, we assessed various T-DNA insertion lines with alterations in vacuolar function, pH homeostasis, Ca transport, stress, and ROS signaling for anoxia tolerance (Table 1; Supplemental Figure S13). Using a simple visual screen, lines with altered expression of a tonoplast localized Ca-ATPase (Geisler et al., 2000), Na/H transporters (Reguera et al., 2015), and V-ATPase (Kriegel et al., 2015) displayed no changes in anoxia tolerance (Table 1; Supplemental Figure S13). Additionally, mutations in genes related to Ca signaling, ROS, and defense signaling, despite showing changes in gene expression in cax1, had loss-of-function phenotypes that closely resembled Col-0 (Supplemental Table 26).

Each of these mutants have been tested thrice; with a minimum of 15 seeds planted for each experiment.Discussion Hypoxia exerts a negative impact on energy production (Atwell et al., 2015). Hypoxic events can be viewed as a sequential, compound stress, where both the lack of oxygen and the reoxygenation periods pose distinct stressors; lack of light exerts another stress, eventually leading to carbon starvation (Loreti et al., 2018). Tolerance is determined by the plant’s ability to acclimate to all these stresses (Yeung et al., 2018). Plants may use spatial and temporal dynamics in Ca to convey information about anoxic conditions (Farnese et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). Here, we identified CAX1 as a Ca transporter whose expression is detrimental to anoxic conditions and submergence (Figures 1 and 2). Using this mutant, we have sought to identify various molecular and physiological processes influencing anoxia tolerance. Our work suggests that cax1 has numerous adaptations to endure anoxia stress (Figure 8): (1) The plant is primed for anoxia through altered expression of ROS, HRGs, and temperature perception genes (Figures 4 and 5; Supplemental Figures S6 and S13 and Supplemental Table S20); (2) During anoxia, changes in light and carbohydrate metabolism may mitigate the stress (Figures 5 and 6); (3) Post anoxia, altered Ca signaling could help dissipate the reoxygenation stress (Figure 7). These findings suggest that altered tonoplast H+/Ca transport impacts an array of biological processes associated with anoxia (Figures 4, 5, 6 and 8); however, mutants in tonoplast localized Ca transporters with different transport kinetics did not impact anoxia tolerance (Table 1). The loss of high-capacity low-affinity Ca transport caused by disruption of CAX1 led to numerous changes in gene expression and protein abundance; the breadth of these changes makes the identification of a single causative pathway for this submergence/anoxia tolerance a challenging endeavor. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Model comparing pre-anoxia and anoxia responses in CAX1 and cax1 lines. Before anoxia, plants appear to have altered regulation of ERF-VII-targeted transcripts and stress response genes such as those involved in systemic-acquired resistance (SAR). During anoxia and post anoxia, cax1 appears to have dampened ROS production, altered (Δ)Ca signaling, and differences in the expression of carbohydrate and metabolism genes.The fact that a subset of HRGs is upregulated in normoxia in cax1, while most of the HRGs are downregulated during hypoxia is intriguing. This suggests that altered Ca homeostasis caused by perturbed CAX1 activates some HRGs, most likely though an ERF-VII-independent pathway, given that this class of transcription factors are highly unstable and thus inactive under aerobic conditions (Weits et al., 2014). Under hypoxia, instead, ERF-VII are stable because of the inability of plant cysteine oxidases to utilize molecular oxygen (Weits et al., 2014). Under these conditions, which promote a vigorous expression of ERF-VII-dependent HRGs, we observed a dampening of the response, which could be beneficial to preserve the carbon reserves required during the recovery phase. Monitoring the protein stability of ERF-VII (e.g. by western blot) as a consequence of CAX1-dependent alterations in Ca fluxes could be difficult but could shed light on the role of Ca on the stability of ERF-VII. Furthermore, future experiments with erfVII/cax1 will be informative to define whether the tolerance in cax1 requires the activity of ERF-VIIs or it is an ERF-VII-independent mechanism of tolerance. As the lack of a waterlogging phenotypes demonstrates, plant roots and shoots have different mechanisms for hypoxia/anoxia stress tolerance (Ellis et al., 1999). Previous work in Arabidopsis has used tissue-specific root ion profiling to show roles of putative CAXs and Ca-ATPase transporters in hypoxia (Wang et al., 2016). These studies demonstrated a gene termed CCX5 (misidentified as CAX11) was involved in hypoxia responses; 3 weeks of waterlogging resulted in dramatic loss of shoot biomass in ccx5 (cax11) plants. It is important to clarify here that CCX5 is not a CAX (Shigaki et al., 2006) and is more closely related to mammalian K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ antiporters (Pittman and Hirschi, 2016). Our results showed that the leaf-expressed CAX1 is detrimental for both anoxia and submergence tolerance (Figures 1 and 2). Furthermore, the expression of CAX1 in cax1-1 suppressed these tolerance phenotypes (Figures 1 and 2). Waterlogging, which results in hypoxia restricted to the root system, provided support to the role of CAX1 limited to the aerial part of the plant (Figure 3). Additionally, CAX3 does not appear to be required for hypoxia signaling given that cax3 remained sensitive to both submergence and waterlogging. In cax1, signaling and metabolic mechanisms for anoxia tolerance are activated, suggesting that CAX1 plays a negative role in low oxygen tolerance (Figure 8). However, the mechanism by which the absence of this transporter positively impacts multiple biochemical mechanisms toward tolerance requires further research. In yeast, the tonoplast localized Ca/H+ antiporter, VCX1, functions to rapidly sequester cytosolic Ca and attenuate the activation of Ca signaling pathways (Miseta et al., 1999). However, the relationship between Ca signaling and CAX1 during limited oxygen conditions is less clear. Defining this relationship is confounded by the variable Ca responses among leaves within the same plant. This work focused on the two older leaves in the four-leaf rosette stage in young plants, where the changes between cax1 and Col-0 were most obvious. In cax1, during the first minute after exposure to oxygen, plants appeared to accumulate less cytosolic Ca in these leaves (Figure 7). One interpretation of this observation is that CAX1 has a minimal role in sequestering cytosolic Ca during this response as its loss would be expected to cause a larger Ca increase if it was removing signaling-related Ca from the cytosol. Indeed, such an increase in the magnitude of the pathogen elicitor-triggered Ca signal is seen when the two tonoplasts localized Ca2+-ATPases ACA4 and ACA 11 are knocked out, providing evidence that for these two pumps, they do normally act to attenuate the Ca signal (Hilleary et al., 2020). From our results, it seems likely that CAX1 is instead functioning to create an exchangeable Ca store that can be drawn upon to generate signals, and this is lost in the mutant. Alternatively, cax1 may cause compensatory upregulation of numerous endomembrane Ca transporters to diminish cytosolic Ca levels (Cheng et al., 2003, 2005). In yeast, the absence of Vcx1p results in heightened Ca-ATPase expression (Callewaert et al., 2020) and may result in the induction or activation of a set of transporters capable of coupling vacuolar Ca uptake to the vacuolar H+ gradient (Miseta et al., 1999). Indeed, our analyses reveal significant (P < 0.01) constitutive transcriptional upregulation to more than two-fold of some classic Ca transporters including ACAs 1 and 9–13 in the cax1 background and as noted above, ACA11 is thought to act to attenuate Ca signaling (Hilleary et al., 2020). We also cannot discount activation of another transport system, or post-translational regulation of, for example the ACAs or CAXs playing an important role in these processes. Caution regarding ascribing any direct mechanistic relationship between cax1-mediated Ca levels and anoxia tolerance is also warranted. For example, the phenotype of anoxia tolerance displayed in the mutant could be caused by heightened H+ pumping. For adequate energy production, residual H+ pumping is critical to cope with anoxia by importing energy-rich compounds (Felle, 2005). The perturbation of Arabidopsis H+-ATPase activities at both the plasma membrane and tonoplast in mutants lacking tonoplast Ca/H+ antiporters (Pittman et al., 2005; Barkla et al., 2008) suggests future studies that address how cax1 impacts transmembrane H+ gradients during oxygen limiting conditions (Reguera et al., 2015). This information may provide important insight into the molecular events underlying cax1 tolerance. A limitation of our model (Figure 8) is its inability to address the known variability in anoxic responses among different tissues and leaves (Banti et al., 2013; Klecker et al., 2014; Ventura et al., 2020). These differences were seen here in both the ROS and Ca imaging experiments (Figures 4 and 7). While the anoxic response is variable, the role of CAX1 in different tissues and leaves also fluctuates. In dicots, CAX1 is found predominately in the tonoplast of mesophyll cells (Conn et al., 2011). Each tissue will have a different proportion of mesophyll cells, and individual cells will have variations in vacuole size and shape (Tan et al., 2019). Thus, there will be developmental and spatial differences in the contribution of CAX1 to Ca and H+ fluxes. For example, in contrast to the major mesophyll expression observed in dicots, in monocots CAX1 is localized to epidermal cells (Conn et al., 2011), we posit monocot loss-of-function mutants will show very different responses to anoxic conditions. Loss-of-function mutations in Arabidopsis H+/Ca transporter CAX1 display a robust conditional phenotype, they gain tolerance to anoxic conditions (Figure 1). The disruption of CAX transport during this stress impacts a myriad of cellular processes: cell wall biosynthesis, metabolism, ROS, hormone, and Ca signaling (Figure 5). Furthermore, the mutants appear to be primed for the stress by having heightened expression of ROS-related transcripts and diminished expression of cold tolerance genes during normal growth conditions (Figure 4; Supplemental Figure S6). The cax1 lines also appear to be “warmed up” as they display heightened expression of heat-responsive transcripts during the anoxia recovery phase (Supplemental Figure S14). Heat shock response involves the induction of a wide range of molecular chaperones to aid in protecting and refolding damaged proteins and so this constitutive production of, for example heat shock proteins may equip cax1 with readymade machinery to cope with some of the cellular damage that anoxia and reoxygenation imposes. Previous work has also shown that cax1 has altered cold-acclimation responses (Catalá et al., 2003) and temperature perception may be an important factor in our anoxia tolerance phenotype.Conclusions This study adds granularity to the role of tonoplast localized Ca transport in plant stress responses. The cax1-mediated anoxia tolerance is caused by extensive changes in both metabolism and signaling. Indeed, one of the most important findings of this study is the breath and amplitude of changes caused by the loss of a single tonoplast H+/Ca transporter (Figures 5 and 6). To harness this knowledge for translational applications, judicious application is advised: CAX transporters impact a variety of plant signal transduction pathways (Pittman and Hirschi, 2016; Bradshaw, 2005; Baliardini et al., 2015, 2016). However, the CAX transporters appear to be autoinhibited, requiring a protein partner for activation (Shigaki and Hirschi, 2006). During anoxic conditions, CAX1 may be activated by a specific regulatory protein and downregulation of this activator during anoxic conditions may be a means of transiently impairing CAX1 function and improving anoxia tolerance.Materials and methods Plant materials The Arabidopsis (A. thaliana) Col-0 and CAX mutant seeds (cax1-1, cax1-2, cax3-1) and various CAX1 construct used in the study have been previously characterized (Catalá et al., 2003; Cheng et al., 2005). In normal growth conditions, the cax1 lines are virtually indistinguishable from Col-0 in terms of size and fertility (Cheng et al., 2003). The CAX mutants were genotyped to confirm the presence of the T-DNA insertions. The plants expressing the binary construct harboring p35S:sCAX1 or pCAX1::CAX1 have both been previously described and growth and stress response phenotypes are similar to Col-0 (Cheng et al., 2003; Conn et al., 2011). Col-0 harboring a stable p35S::GCaMP3 Ca biosensor construct (Toyota et al., 2018; GCamP3/Col-0) was crossed with cax1 to obtain GCamP3/cax1. F3 plants that were verified as cax1-1 were then assayed for expression of GCamP3.Plant growth, anoxia, and flooding treatment Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized in 20% bleach (v/v) for 15 min before they were planted on 1/2X Murashige and Skoog (MS) media containing 0.8% agar (w/v) and 0.5% sucrose (w/v), and were grown under equal day/night light conditions (12-h light, 22°C, 180 μmol·m−2·s −1, and 12-h night 20°C). For anoxia treatments, 21-day-old plants (nine-rosette leaf developmental stage) were foil covered at 2:00 pm and then placed in a GasPak using anaerobic atmosphere generation bags (Sigma) for 7 h or an anoxia chamber (Anaerobe Systems, AS-580, Morgan Hill, CA, USA). After the treatment the plants are returned to the growth chamber. Images were taken 3 or 4 days after the anoxia treatment to assess plant tolerance. Plants for the submergence and waterlogging experiments were grown as described (Ventura et al., 2020). Briefly, were grown in pots for 3–4 weeks at 23°C with a 12-/12-h photoperiod at 120 μmol photons m−2 s−1 before being used in our experiments. Waterlogging treatments were performed on 3-week-old plants, during which all the root system was immersed in water, but the leaves and petioles were above the water level. For the submergence experiments, the plants were submerged in tanks with a water level of 10-cm above leaf level. The submergence treatment was carried out in the dark (also the controls in air were in the dark), while waterlogged plants were kept under the normal day/night cycle.Plant phenotyping Plant trays were placed in a LabScanalyzer (LemnaTec, GmbH, Aachen, Germany) imaging box equipped with a Manta G-1236 camera (Allied Vision Technologies GmbH, Stadtroda, Germany) and a Kowa LM12XC lens (Kowa Optimed Deutschland GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany). Trays were illuminated by two cool white LED panels (polyscale GmbH & Co. KG, Aachen, Germany) mounted beside the camera at an angle of 30° to prevent direct reflection from the imaging area. The raw images acquired as previously described (Ventura et al., 2020) and analyzed with LemnaGrid software (LemnaTec, GmbH, Aachen). The parameters measured were the projected leaf area (PLA, area of the rosette) and color (HUE) as described in Ventura et al. (2020). In order to allow comparison of plants with different size in air, we used the ratio between the PLA values of individual plants subjected to either submergence or waterlogging and the average PLA value of aerobic plants of the same genotype (PLA ratio).Chlorophyll fluorescence measurement Chlorophyll content was measured via spectroscopic absorbance of chlorophyll a and b, as previously described (Yeung et al., 2018). Briefly chlorophyll was extracted from 3-week-old whole rosettes (nine-rosette leaf stage) using 96% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Approximately 100 mg of fresh leaf sample was ground in 96% DMSO and incubated at 65°C water bath for 4 h. After cooling, the supernatant was collected and absorbance at 664, 647, and 750 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer (Cary 50) in 1-mL cuvettes. Chlorophyll a and b concentrations, and total chlorophyll content were calculated following the equations of reference and were normalized to tissue fresh weight.RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis Approximately 100 mg of full rosettes from anoxia-treated or untreated plants were frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen, and were subjected to Trizol total RNA extraction. Total RNA samples were sent to BGI Genomics (BGI Americas Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA) for transcriptome sequencing on their DNBseq platform using 150-bp pair-end sequencing chemistry. Data processing and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis were also conducted by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Briefly, the reads obtained after sequencing were filtered to remove any low-quality, adapter-polluted, and high content of unknown base (N) reads. The clean reads thus obtained were mapped to the Arabidopsis reference genome (TAIR10_Araport11_www.arabidopsis.org_20190423) using HISAT2 (Kim et al., 2015). New transcripts were identified by StringTie (Pertea et al., 2015), Cuffcompare (Trapnell et al., 2012), and CP5 (Kong et al., 2007); and SNP and INDEl variants by GATK (McKenna et al., 2010). Total clean reads were again mapped to reference using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), and then calculated the gene expression level with RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). DEGs were detected with DEseq2, based on the negative binomial distribution (Love et al., 2014). Leaf tissue from 21-day-old plants were used for transcriptome analysis. RNA-seq data were obtained from three independent biological replicates for each of the conditions analyzed. On average, sequencing from the DNBseq platform generated 6.77 Gb bases per sample. All the samples had clean raw reads higher than 44 Mb. The average mapping ratio with the reference genome was 90.03% and the average mapping ratio was 78.29. Complete RNA-seq data have been deposited in the SRA database with the accession no. PRJNA666693.RNA extraction and RT–qPCR Total RNA was extracted using trizol from 50-mg full rosette leaves. For RT–qPCR, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1-μg RNA using oligo dT18 primers (Invitrogen). RT–qPCR was performed on a Biorad CFX96 Real-Time PCR System (Biorad) with iTAQ SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad). Primers used are listed in Supplemental Table S27. Relative transcript abundance was calculated using the comparative 2−ΔΔCT method normalized to UBQ10 (Czechowski et al., 2005). The absence of a complete functional transcript in the mutants were confirmed by semi-quantitative PCR using the primers spanning either sides of T-DNA insertion (Supplemental Figure S15).Mass spectrometry proteomic analysis Arabidopsis whole rosette leaves were harvested from 2.5-week-old plants (six-rosette leaf stage) and proteins were extracted from leaves (Barkla et al., 2009). Protein identification was carried out at the Institute for Molecular Biosciences proteomics facility at the University of Queensland, Brisbane. Proteins were analyzed using an Eksigent, Ekspert nano LC400 uHPLC coupled to a TripleTOF 6600+ System (SCIEX, Canada) equipped with a PicoView nanoflow ion source (New Objective, USA). For protein isolation, 3 g of tissue were ground in liquid N2 and were then subjected to extraction using prechilled buffer containing: 100-mm Tris-MES, pH 8.0, 1-mm EGTA, 5-mm dithiothreitol, 4-mm MgSO4, 5% [w/v] insoluble POLYVINYLPYRROLIDONE (PVP), and plant protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) to the recommended concentration by manufacturer. The homogenate was then filtrated through Miracloth (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA), and subsequently clarified by centrifugation to remove cellular debris. The total proteins in supernatant (500 μL) were then precipitated using 200-μL 10X TE, 200 μL of 0.3% sodium deoxycholate, and 200 μL of cold 72% TCA. The protein pellets were washed in 90% methanol at room temperature and subsequently lyophilized. Proteins were analyzed using an Eksigent, Ekspert nano LC400 uHPLC coupled to a TripleTOF 6600+ System (SCIEX, Canada) equipped with a PicoView nanoflow ion source (New Objective, USA). Protein extract (up to 5 μL) was injected onto a ChromXP C18-CL column (3 μm, 75 μm × 150 mm; SCIEX, Canada). Mobile phase solvents consisted of solvent A: 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Linear gradients of 5%–30% solvent B were run over 120 min at 400-nL min−1 flow rate, followed by 30%–90% solvent B for 3 min, then 90% solvent B for 17 min, for peptide elution. The gradient was then returned to 5% solvent B for equilibration prior to the next sample injection. Column temperature was maintained at 45°C throughout. The ion spray voltage was set to 2,600 V, declustering potential at 80V, curtain gas flow 25 psi, nebulizer gas 30 psi, and interface heater at 150°C. The mass spectrometer was set to acquire 100 ms of full scan time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) data over the mass range 350–1,500 m/z, followed by up to fifty 50-ms full scan product ion data in IDA mode over the mass range 100–1,500 m/z. Ions observed in the TOF-MS scan exceeding a threshold of 100 counts and a charge state of +2 to +5 were set to trigger the acquisition of product ion tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra of the resultant 50 most intense ions.Protein identification and quantification Protein Pilot 5.0.2 (SCIEX, Canada) was used to search spectra against the Uniprot Arabidopsis database (129,652 proteins, 12 May 2020) and encode the output mzIdentML file for the downstream analysis. Scaffold 4.8.6 (Proteome Software, Portland, OR, USA) was used to validate MS/MS-based protein identifications and quantification. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at >99% probability and contained at least two unique peptides. NSAF was used for protein quantification (Gulcicek et al., 2005; Searle, 2010).Bioinformatics analysis for GO enrichment analysis Proteins identified in at least two out of three biological replicates of leaf tissue from Col-0, cax1, and cax3 post anoxia (8 h) were considered as present in the corresponding genotypes. To evaluate the significance of comparative quantification by different genotypes, Student’s t test was performed on the data, and the differences were assigned to be significant at a P <0.05. DAPs (including exclusively present proteins) were submitted to GO enrichment using ClusterProfiler package in R (Wu et al., 2021).Malondialdehyde measurements Malondialdehyde (MDA) was quantified using a colorimetric method (Stewart and Bewley, 1980). Briefly, full rosette leaves of 3-week-old plants (nine-rosette leaf stage) were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in 80% (v/v) ethanol. The supernatant was collected and mixed with a reactant mixture of 0.65% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid and 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532 nm with a spectrophotometer (Cary 50) in 1-mL cuvettes. To reduce the nonspecific absorption from other organic compounds, absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 600 nm and subtracted from the absorbance at 532 nm.In situ staining of hydrogen peroxide and cell death in Arabidopsis leaves Production of hydrogen peroxide in the cell was visualized by DAB staining and quantitated by measuring the oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) (Daudi and O'Brien, 2012). Cell death was assayed by trypan blue staining (Bhadauria et al., 2010).In situ staining of hydrogen peroxide and cell death assays in Arabidopsis leaves DAB staining The in situ staining of hydrogen peroxide in Arabidopsis leaves was performed following established protocols (Daudi and O'Brien, 2012). Whole rosettes from 3-week-old plants were stained with 1 mg/mL 3,3′-freshly prepared DAB dissolved in 20-mM Na2HPO4 (pH 5.6) and 0.05% Tween-20. The leaves were stained at room temperature with shaking at 80–100 rpm under dark conditions for 6h. Following the incubation, the DAB staining solution was replaced with the destaining solution (80% ethanol) and incubated at 80°C for 15–20 min to remove the chlorophyll. This process was repeated until the chlorophyll was completely removed.H2DCFDA staining Cellular levels of H2O2 were studied by H2DCFDA staining (Pedersen et al., 2017). The mature outer rosette leaves from 3-week-old plants were detached and stained with 10-µM H2DCFDA prepared in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min. After incubation, the leaves were washed twice with potassium phosphate buffer to remove the extra staining solution. The leaves were examined under a Leica TCS SPE Microscope (Model: DMi8 automated) using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, under 10× magnification.Trypan blue staining Arabidopsis leaves were assayed for cell death using trypan blue (Rawyler et al., 2002). Whole rosettes from 3-week-old plants were covered with lactophenol–trypan blue solution (10 mL of lactic acid, 10 mL of glycerol, 10 g of phenol, 10 mg of trypan blue, dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water). Leaves were stained at room temperature without vacuum infiltration in the solution for 1 h. Following incubation, the staining solution was replaced with 100% ethanol solution and incubated at room temperature overnight. The leaves were washed repeatedly in absolute ethanol until the green tissue became colorless. Leaves were then mounted onto glass microscopic slide with 60% glycerol (v/v) and were observed under Nikon SMZ1500 Microscope (WD136-Nikon). The blue precipitation indicating location of cell death was quantified using ImageJ software.Real-time measurements of cytosolic Ca in plant leaves post anoxia Plants were transformed with p35S:GCaMP3 using Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 and floral dip according to (Atwell et al., 2015). Transformants were selected on hygromycin and T2 (or greater) lines used for analysis. Arabidopsis plants expressing the GFP-based Ca indicator GCaMP3 were imaged with a motorized fluorescence stereomicroscope (Zeiss Axio Zoom V16; Model, EMS3/SyCoP3) equipped with a PlanNeoFluar Z 1.0× objective lens and a Zeiss AxioCam HRm sCMOS camera. GCaMP3 was excited using a mercury lamp (with an intensity of 100% power of 150W Metal Halide Zeiss HXP 200c Illuminator), with a 470-/40-nm excitation filter, and a 500-nm dichroic mirror. The green fluorescent signal (Zeiss Filter Set 10 – GF) passing through a 535-/50-nm emission filter was acquired every 1 s for a total of 6 min with 210 Frames (360.55 s) using Zeiss Zen pro imaging software. Col-0 or cax1-1 harboring the GCaMP3 sensor constructs were grown on half-strength MS media supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) sucrose. For experiments that monitored the onset of anoxia, plants were grown in small Petri dishes then placed in a plastic bag with 1 AnaeroPack (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The bag was modified to contain a glass-slide as a viewing window. Upon the onset of anoxia, the plant was immediately viewed through the window under the microscope as anoxic conditions formed within the bag. To minimize condensation, and not obstruct the imaging, a small ice pack was placed away from the plant inside prior to sealing the bag. Numerous no anoxia controls were performed (n > 20) to establish that the ice did not impact Ca signaling. Additionally, numerous (n > 30) experiments were performed for 30 min or more to establish that no signaling occurred after the initial Ca changes at the onset of anoxia. For post-anoxia measurements, the surgical tape around the plates was removed to allow air exchange in and out of the plates. The plates were then foil covered and placed in heat-sealed AnaeroPouch with one bag of AnaeroPack (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). GCamP3 fluorescence was measured to assay cytosolic Ca concentrations immediately after the plants were re-exposed to atmospheric oxygen. It took 15–30 s to reproducibly transfer the plants from the anoxic chamber to the microscope, precluding precise measurement during this initial period. Fluorescence was analyzed using ImageJ. Mean fluorescence intensity over time was then measured in the background and subtracted from the plant measurement. It is important to note that GCamP3 shows a very low signal under low Ca2+ and then up to a six-fold increase when Ca2+ levels rise. Therefore, the background represents a substantial proportion of the unstimulated signal (Supplemental Figure S16). Background was Col-0: 11.7 ± 3.4; cax1: 16.8 ± 5.7, mean ± sd. Experiments were run in duplicate each day and experiments repeated on different days over the course of multiple months until data from at least 10 replicates was recorded. See supplementary data for full description.Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post hoc testing or the Student’s t test formula in Microsoft Excel. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Data were presented as means ± sems.Accession numbers Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession number PRJNA666693. cax1-A (ABRC: CS25435), cax1-D (SALK_021486C), cax3 (ABRC: CS25429).Supplemental data The following materials are available in the online version of this article.

    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10027818/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight presents a multifaceted environment for plants, combining the effects on growth of many stressors and factors including altered gravity, the influence of experiment hardware, and increased radiation exposure. To help understand the plant response to this complex suite of factors this study compared transcriptomic analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceflight experiments deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s GeneLab data repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing significant differential expression in spaceflight versus ground controls using a single common computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq datasets. Such a standardized approach to analysis should greatly increase the robustness of comparisons made between datasets. This analysis was coupled with extensive cross-referencing to a curated matrix of metadata associated with these experiments. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to define plant reactions to spaceflight. The metadata matrix allows selection of studies with high similarity scores, i.e., that share multiple elements of experimental design, such as plant age or flight hardware. Comparisons between these studies then helps reduce the complexity in drawing conclusions arising from comparisons made between experiments with very different designs. Subject terms: Plant sciences, Genetic databases",
    "introduction": "Introduction Spaceflight imposes a unique suite of environmental effects on biology. For example, microgravity severely curtails the signals normally generated on Earth from the intrinsic weight of a plant’s organs1 and by its gravity perceptive cells2–4. By contrast, in the terrestrial environment, these are key factors driving normal growth and development. In addition, gravitational forces on Earth govern a host of physical processes including gas and liquid flow that are important for normal plant function. Thus, the microgravity environment can lead to the development of anoxic regions around metabolically active plant tissues and altered patterns of evaporative and convective cooling that can impact leaf function and physiology5–8. Additionally, the increased radiation exposure inherent in spaceflight is likely to trigger its own array of responses within the plant. The combination of these spaceflight-linked effects is outside the evolutionary history of terrestrial biology and so it remains complicated to predict the effects of spaceflight on organisms. Yet, understanding the molecular and physiological responses of plants to these conditions remains an important goal for space biologists, not the least because plants are integral to many plans for life support on long-duration crewed missions and for colonization9. One way to probe the responses of organisms to spaceflight is by analysis of changes in their transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, genomes and epigenomes induced by exposure to this environment. In the field of plant biology the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab data repository10,11 has aggregated many such omics datasets. Critically, the deposited data are associated with extensive metadata covering elements of each experiment’s design ranging from features of the hardware, radiation exposure and lighting regime to treatment duration, genotype and organism age. Such extensive and accurate metadata are critical to understanding the breadth of differences in experimental designs when making comparisons between studies. This insight is important as the flight hardware used, the analysis methodology employed (e.g., microarray versus RNA-seq for transcriptome studies) and other experimental parameters likely superimpose their own, often poorly defined, influences on the results (so-called batch effects12). Indeed, recent analysis of rodent spaceflight data suggests differences in sample preservation eclipsed spaceflight-driven differences in mouse transcriptional profiling13. However, given the relatively few opportunities to conduct experiments in space, making comparisons between existing studies represents a potentially powerful approach to identify common responses in the often-limited available spaceflight data. We have therefore imported 15 spaceflight-related plant transcriptome datasets from the GeneLab data repository and manually curated the associated metadata to develop a metadata matrix (hereafter, the Matrix). This approach allows the more robust design of comparisons between studies that share commonalities in experimental design. Our meta-analyses broadly confirmed the spaceflight-related changes in cell wall processes and oxidative stress that were highlighted in many of the original publications associated with each individual study. Additionally, Matrix-driven analyses helped reveal new response elements, such as conserved spaceflight-triggered changes in expression of the cold response gene COLD RESPONSIVE 78 (COR78), and likely shifts in ion transport processes. We also identified factors within the experimental design such as choice of flight hardware and especially assay technique (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) that can impose greater differences between datasets than the spaceflight treatment. Thus, the Matrix allows researchers to explore the wealth of plant biology transcriptomic data generated during spaceflight-related studies and provides an approach to better understand underlying factors impacting the robustness of comparisons made between the different datasets.",
    "methods": "Methods Assay pipelines and datasets The GeneLab data repository currently holds the largest number of publicly accessible datasets of omics- (transcriptomics-, proteomics-, epigenomics- and genomics-) based studies of biological, spaceflight-related studies. For our analyses of plant responses using this resource we focused on the results assessing changes in the transcriptome as the most numerous kind of dataset available. We included such studies based on the minimal criteria that they: (1) were performed on the most widely used plant model species, Arabidopsis thaliana (which represents nearly all of the plant data currently deposited in GeneLab) and (2) had at least 3 biological replicates per treatment (to provide statistical rigor on subsequent analyses). A summary of the 15 studies (encompassing 10 microarray and 6 RNA-seq GeneLab Data Sets, or GLDS) that fulfill these requirements is presented in Table 2. These experiments were performed on missions run by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Chinese Space Agency. To ensure the greatest degree of comparability between results, all of the primary data was reanalyzed through common computational approaches developed by GeneLab and implemented in the Galaxy computing environment44. Briefly, the microarray analysis pipeline used the R/Bioconductor software package limma45 to perform differential gene expression analysis. Background correction by the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method and between array normalization by the quantile method46 were performed through the Bioconductor Oligo package47. Gene level estimation was generated using the Maximum Interquartile Range method and annotations were added using the Annotation-Db class gene annotations specific to Arabidopsis thaliana from the Bioconductor repository (www.bioconductor.org). In cases where multiple probes mapped to the same gene ID, representative probes were selected with the highest mean normalized intensity across all samples. Differential gene expression analysis used the linear model fit from the limma R package to perform pairwise comparisons for all groups. For each probe set, the variance of mean signal intensities was estimated, improved by an empirical Bayes method for combining variances of probes showing similar variability, and the significance of the difference between the means was evaluated with a t-test to obtain p-values. p-values were also adjusted to q-values to account for possible errors introduced through multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method48 and so control for the false discovery rate.

Datasets are publicly available at the GeneLab data repository using the url: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-#/, where # represents the GLDS accession number for each study.The RNA-seq analysis pipeline used the universal RNA-seq aligner STAR v2.7.1a49 and the RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization approach (RSEM v1.3.1)13,50 along with the TAIR10 genome assembly51 accessed through Ensembl Plants52,53. Raw sequence data were trimmed and filtered with Trim Galore! (v0.6.2). The Arabidopsis thaliana Ensembl reference genome TAIR10, release 44, and respective GTF file were used to align trimmed reads with STAR (v2.7.1a) then the aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (v1.3.1). Quantification data was imported to R (v3.6.0) using the tximport package (v1.14.0) and normalized using the DESeq2 (v1.26.0) median of ratios method54. Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 (v1.26.0) and pairwise comparisons of all groups were performed using the Wald test to generate p- and adjusted p-values, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the Bioconductor org.At.tair.db (v3.8.2), STRINGdb (v1.24.0)29, and PANTHER.db (v1.0.4)55 packages. Processing code for each RNA-seq dataset are available at https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNA-seq/GLDS_Processing_Scripts and both the raw and processed data are deposited at https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects. The associated metadata for each dataset was aggregated using a combination of the information provided alongside each GeneLab data submission, parallel manual curation from the literature and through interviews with the primary researchers. The Matrix of this data is available as both Supplementary Data 1 and as an interactive exploration environment developed in the Qlik database management software environment (Qlik Technologies Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA) at https://gilroy-qlik.botany.wisc.edu/a/sense/app/20aa802b-6915-4b1a-87bd-c029a1812e2b. When they have been employed in the data analyses, online tools such as the TOAST X-Species Transcriptional Explorer (https://gilroy-qlik.botany.wisc.edu/a/sense/app/ab2250b5-ee3a-4da8-b5da-fe87d5f2dbe6/overview), KnetMiner23, Metascape24, Ensembl GO53, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes56, AraCyc57 and Reactome58 are noted in the text and figure legends. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling analysis (MDS), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE), Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) and K-means statistical analyses were performed using the iDEP.94 R-package59. For these analyses, the normalized counts were imported from the GeneLab data repository and processed using R-studio.

    "results": "Results and discussion Comparative transcriptomics of plant spaceflight-response data One method to assess the similarities and differences in transcriptome-level responses between different plant spaceflight experiments is to make comparisons using the results of the analyses already presented in the primary literature on each study. This approach can be further expedited using tools, such as the Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database14 that aggregates these analyses into an interactive data exploration environment. Such comparative studies capitalize upon the unique insights of the researchers who performed each experiment and the tailored analytical tools and approaches they then employed to define differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in their original publications. We will refer to these studies as in-house analyses. However, the wide range of analytical pipelines used in such a primary literature-based approach inevitably imposes some limitations on the robustness of any conclusions that can be drawn between studies. This problem arises because differences in gene expression patterns between datasets likely involve both the effects of experimental treatments, such as growing plants in spaceflight versus a ground control, and of elements specific to the different analytical programs and statistical approaches used to analyze the data. Indeed, differences between results from different software packages analyzing the same raw transcriptomics datasets are well-documented in the literature15. Therefore, a complementary methodology was also applied by reanalyzing the plant studies used in our analysis via the common computational pipelines summarized in Fig. 1. A similar strategy of reanalyzing published datasets using a common computational approach has been used in the EMBL-EBI gene Expression Atlas. For example, when these researchers import RNA-seq data, a standardized analysis is performed using the integrated RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline, or iRAP, approach16. Although this analysis pipeline is different from the one we have adopted, the standardizing of analysis across all datasets for the EMBL-EBI gene Expression Atlas is designed with the same goal in mind: to reduce the potential for generating artifacts that are caused by making comparisons between datasets that have been the subject of different initial data analysis methodologies. Fig. 1. Uniform analysis pipeline applied to Arabidopsis GLDS datasets used in this study. Open in a new tab Normalized expression arrays are imported from NASA’s GeneLab repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) and then parsed by the TOAST X-Species Transcriptional Explorer (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/x-species-astrobiology-genelab) for analysis of common features between experiments (cross experiment intersect analysis). The iDEP.92 R-shiny app59 is then used to generate expression heatmaps for clustering, and to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling analysis (MDS), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE), Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) and K-means statistical analyses. Functional analyses are then performed using the online tools at Ensembl GO53, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes)56, AraCyc57 and Reactome58. These data are then visualized as tables and dendrograms of the enriched functional groups that are altered by spaceflight and/or related stimuli.Using our common analysis pipeline approach to comparing DEGs across all the Arabidopsis studies, batch effects (i.e., confounding variables imposing effects on patterns of gene expression over and above those of the spaceflight treatment) became readily evident. Thus, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Euclidean hierarchical clustering revealed that rather than the comparison between of spaceflight and ground control, whether RNA-seq or microarray was used to detect patterns of gene expression is the factor with the largest effect on separating studies (PCA1, explaining 83% of the variance between experiments; Fig. 2a, c). Similar analysis showed the important but lesser impact of lighting environment (Fig. 2b). It is important to note here that we have used a statistical threshold of p < 0.01 to define a DEG. Our analysis pipeline also generates the more stringent adjusted p-value (or q-value) that corrects the p-value for the false discovery rate associated with multiple testing. Although we have analyzed the p-value filtered results to encompass as broad a set of DEGs as possible, q-values are presented in the tables of Supplementary Data, to allow the reader to define DEG lists using this parameter. Similarly, a cut off related to fold-change in expression (such as only evaluating genes showing ≥2-fold change in e.g., spaceflight versus their paired ground control) is often used in the literature to limit the extent of the gene lists being analyzed. Again, we have opted not to apply such a fold-change cut off to maintain the most inclusive list of DEGs for analysis. However, fold-change in expression level is also presented in the Supplementary Data, allowing the reader to filter the gene lists using a fold-change cut off as appropriate for their analyses Fig. 2.

Genotypes: WT wild-type, act2 actin 2, arg1 altered response to gravity 1, atm1 ataxia-telangiectasia mutated 1, hsfa2 heat shock transcription factor A2, phyD phytochrome D.We next created a connectivity network visualization system using all the pairwise comparisons that can be made between the GLDS used in our analysis (Fig. 3a–g; Supplementary Data 2; an interactive version of this connectivity analysis is available at: https://gilroy-qlik.botany.wisc.edu/a/sense/app/20aa802b-6915-4b1a-87bd-c029a1812e2b/sheet/6241e71a-a3c5-4c63-9210-e05c743699d7/state/analysis). Pairwise factor correlation analysis was performed by inspection of the Matrix in Supplementary Data 1 and manually scoring factors that are similar between different pairs of studies, assigning a value of 1 for each factor shared between a pair and a value of zero if that factor was different. Thus, the more factors in common between a pair of studies, the greater their similarity scores. The full pairwise similarity matrix can be found in Supplementary Data 2. This approach linked the studies using similarity scores reflecting commonalities in the different experimental designs and metadata factors within the datasets in our study. Such network analysis allowed us to further visualize and dissect links between the factors that potentially cause the clustering of studies identified in the PCA (Fig. 2). When represented graphically as links between studies and metadata factors, this analysis demonstrated that hardware and its associated lighting regimes were indeed likely key components that influence clustering of responses in the data (Fig. 4).

An interactive version of this visualization is available at: https://gilroy-qlik.botany.wisc.edu/a/sense/app/20aa802b-6915-4b1a-87bd-c029a1812e2b/sheet/6241e71a-a3c5-4c63-9210-e05c743699d7/state/analysis.It is important to remember here that the lighting environment for an experiment is often dictated by the hardware that was used, for example, most plant experiments performed to date using the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware are conducted in the dark. Therefore, lighting and hardware are inevitably closely linked in our network analyses of current datasets. This observation also highlights the insight that could be gained by performing more studies that use the same hardware but with a range of lighting environments. Such analyses could help separate hardware-related effects on the plant during growth in space from those specifically triggered by the lighting environment under those conditions. Such network analyses distinguish those studies sharing a high degree of network linkages within the Matrix, i.e., studies with a larger number of common features in their experimental design. Results of comparisons between such highly connected studies are candidates for more robust analyses due to these shared factors. For example, although the overall experimental designs behind GLDS-7, GLDS-37, GLDS-38, and GLDS-120 differ from each other by ecotype, hardware or experiment duration, each links to multiple other spaceflight experiments within the Matrix and form hubs in networks related to hardware and/or tissue sample type (Fig. 3g). Thus, GLDS-7 was performed in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) and is of interest due to the high number of tissues and ecotypes in its experimental design that link to many other studies in the Matrix. GLDS-37 was conducted in the BRIC hardware and is extensively linked to other studies due to the large number of Arabidopsis ecotypes analyzed, as well as the many other Arabidopsis BRIC experiments available for comparison. GLDS-38 (BRIC) provides RNA-seq and paired proteomics data that likewise connect to many other BRIC datasets. GLDS-120 took place with a unique hardware setup (square Petri plates that were attached to the inside wall of the International Space Station), but contains multiple ecotypes, genotypes and light treatments that link it to many other studies in the Matrix. These connections to other studies suggest that comparisons within the local networks where each study acts as a hub are likely to be fruitful targets to extract common spaceflight-related responses. Conversely, such network analyses also revealed studies that are the most distinct (i.e., least shared metadata factors with other Matrix studies). One clear set of such studies are those designed around terrestrial spaceflight analogs such as GLDS-46, GLDS-136, and GLDS-144. These experiments use elements such as hyperbaric chambers, space radiation analog exposures, and microgravity simulation on clinostats and random positioning machines to mimic specific aspects of the spaceflight environment and so are more distant in design to the other spaceflight experiments. Thus, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, pairwise similarity matrix comparisons show spaceflight studies are most similar to other spaceflight studies (average pairwise similarity score of 5.88 ± 1.93) and significantly less similar (p < 0.01) when compared to ground analog studies (average similarity 4.21 ± 1.36), which are most similar to other ground analog studies. This Matrix-driven network visualization then highlights the opportunity to design follow-up experiments that use these analogs of putative spaceflight stressors but where the design of the study is more interconnected to the factors seen in their closest spaceflight studies within the Matrix. Such aligned experimental designs could help increase the robustness of subsequent comparisons to the existing spaceflight data. We next asked if we could define factors within the metadata other than spaceflight treatment that help define clustering within the studies. We therefore took the expression level data for each individual sample replicate (normalized probe fluorescence intensity for microarray and FPKM for RNAseq) from all the studies in the Matrix and calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient for all possible pairwise combinations (Supplementary Data 3). We next calculated the average Pearson’s correlation coefficient from this analysis for each set of replicates within an experiment, providing a measure of correlation for each treatment within a dataset to all other treatments in all datasets in the Matrix. We then sorted these data by each metadata factor within the Matrix to ask if a particular metadata factor stood out as explaining the patterns of correlation within the transcriptomics data. Of these, radiation treatment was the most highly correlated factor (Supplementary Data 3), followed by genotype, tissue/developmental stage, flight hardware and then altered gravity (i.e., spaceflight). This analysis again highlights the likelihood that many experimental factors are imposing patterns on spaceflight transcriptional profiles and reinforces the effects of radiation exposure as a key area for future spaceflight-related experimentation. Mining the Matrix for common patterns of spaceflight-responsive gene expression Insights from the network of connections between the spaceflight-related datasets in the Matrix were then used to make comparisons between gene expression patterns seen in spaceflight treatments and ground control samples (e.g., excluding the ground-based spaceflight analog studies). Having defined the assay type (microarray versus RNA-seq) as one of the most important confounding factors when comparing spaceflight responsive transcripts across multiple datasets (Fig. 2), the microarray and RNA-seq datasets were separated into two parallel analysis pipelines. The data of the DEGs within the two series of datasets was then analyzed using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Unguided WGCNA clustering identified 3 groupings within the microarray datasets and 4 within the RNA-seq data (Fig. 5a–c). Krishnamurthy et al.17 have compared microarray and RNA-seq analyses of identical samples from Arabidopsis roots, concluding that although the two approaches broadly agreed (on ~66% of ~6400 DEGs in their study), RNA-seq analysis revealed significantly more DEGs. Thus, in our study the RNA-seq is likely providing a broader dataset within which to find enriched Gene Ontologies likely leading to the increased number of groupings found by our analysis. Fig. 5. Unguided Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) clustering of the Arabidopsis datasets used in this study. Open in a new tab This analysis was performed on the DEGs identified in the RNA-seq (a) and microarray (c) datasets from the spaceflight experiments imported into the Matrix (see Table 2 for specific datasets used). This analysis identified 4 clusters of DEGs within the RNA-seq (a) and 3 clusters within the microarray analyses (c). b Overlap in the DEGs within each cluster between the WGCNA RNA-seq and microarray analyses. Purple curves link identical genes and light blue curves link genes that, although not identical, belong to the same enriched Gene Ontology term found in each clade. The inner circle represents gene lists, where hits are arranged along the arc. Genes that hit multiple clusters are colored in dark orange, and genes unique to a single cluster are shown in light orange. d List of top 20 significantly enriched Gene Ontologies drawn from the clusters of DEGs depicted in a–c that are shared by 2 or more clusters. The full list of enriched Gene Ontology terms is reproduced in Supplementary Data Fig. 1.

Count number of loci included in enrichment analysis, % proportion of all query genes that are found in the given Gene Ontology term, P p-value, q p-value adjusted for multiple testing. Analysis made using Metascape24.The top 20 enriched ontology groupings shared between the RNA-seq and microarray analyses are summarized in Fig. 5d and the full set of significantly enriched Gene Ontologies is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. Clade I in both the microarray and RNA-seq stands out as sharing the most common significantly DEGs. When expanding this analysis to include shared significantly enriched Gene Ontology terms (Fig. 5c), terms that broadly cover response to environmental stresses (such as to light, cold and bacteria) are seen (Supplementary Fig. 2). This observation supports the conclusions from numerous previous spaceflight analyses that plants exhibit a suite of stress-related responses when encountering the spaceflight environment. However, a further prominent and novel shared element seen across these analyses is changes in the expression of genes related to photosynthesis, other aspects of primary metabolism and also changes to secondary metabolism (Fig. 5d). This observation suggests that spaceflight and spaceflight-related treatments are likely impacting these fundamental aspects of plant function. However, as a note of caution, this analysis combines the responses across all the diverse plant datasets within the Matrix. Even though the analysis in Fig. 5d is filtered to exclude the broadest Gene Ontology terms (i.e., those terms encompassing more than 100 genes), such wide-ranging analysis might be expected to reveal only the most general common responses, whilst being relatively insensitive to more subtle or specific spaceflight responses. This is because of the variation likely imposed by the wide range of experimental designs encompassed by these datasets, i.e., in addition to spaceflight-related effects a host of other responses are likely superimposed on the data, diluting the signal from some spaceflight responses. It seems likely a similar reason explains the observation that, although there are shared spaceflight enriched gene ontologies between experiments, there is no individual DEG common to all these experiments. The Matrix facilitates a more targeted subset of comparisons between datasets (e.g., chosen based on commonalities in the hardware or plant samples used within each experiment) that might be expected to reduce this experimental design-driven noise to reveal these more specific shared gene groupings. An example of such an analysis described in the following section. Analysis of studies using common hardware: BRIC datasets provide 2 tissue types and 2 transcriptome assay types for meta-analysis The analyses in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that both the specific flight hardware used and its associated lighting regime significantly impact the patterns of gene expression noted in plants in spaceflight. Further, our network analyses (Fig. 3b) show that GLDS-17, GLDS-37, GLDS-38, GLDS-44, and GLDS-121 are all highly connected, especially for these factors. Thus, these studies all used etiolated seedlings grown in the dark in the Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) cassettes of the BRIC hardware. Additionally, samples were harvested at the young seedling stage of development (up to 12 days old) and all included a paired on-orbit and ground control design to allow for exploration of spaceflight-related patterns of DEGs18–22. Differences between the studies include ecotype and analysis type (microarray versus RNA-seq). Nevertheless, their high levels of similarity, especially at the level of the hardware and lighting used, suggested to us that they could provide an important set of similarly designed experimentation to help more robustly reveal common spaceflight responses. Additionally, all these studies have published in-house analyses from their respective research groups, allowing us to further test the relative merits of comparisons drawn between the in-house results from each original publication versus the common analytical pipeline that we have used in this study. Table 1 presents a summary of the total numbers of DEGs detected in these analyses at p ≤ 0.01 alongside the overlap in these gene lists between the in-house and common pipeline analyses (the full lists of DEGs are shown in Supplementary Data 4).

The significance threshold to identify DEGs was set at p < 0.01. In a previous comparative analysis, Johnson et al.23 reported no common genes amongst the BRIC-16 mission microarray studies (GLDS-17, -44 and -121) when using a cutoff of p < 0.01 but also applying a threshold of 5-fold or greater for induction or repression in transcript level as measured on their microarray (to define the most strongly regulated genes). We therefore reanalyzed these microarray results using a pipeline similar to the original authors’ analyses (Affymetrix Express pipeline and the Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error (PLIER) approach for normalization21, with a significance setting p < 0.01) but now using no fold-change filtering (Supplementary Data 4) to be more analogous to the GeneLab analytical pipeline we have also applied. Using the in-house analysis by the researchers (GLDS-1718, GLDS-4422) and the reanalysis of GLDS-12121 using PLIER, the results of our comparisons across all the microarray studies conducted with wild-type seedlings identified 86 spaceflight-related DEGs found across all studies (Supplementary Data 5). The GeneLab reanalysis identified 114 loci in common between the 3 studies, including 85% of the genes from the in-house analysis. Analysis of the 75 DEGs identified in all 3 studies by both analytical techniques using MetaScape24 (Fig. 6) revealed enrichment in Gene Ontology terms including: regionalization, response to Karrikin (a plant stress response pathway triggered by volatiles originally found in smoke), regulation of stomatal movement and tropism. These latter two terms are particularly interesting as disruption of gravitropic growth is one of the predicted responses of plants growing in the microgravity environment of spaceflight. Although patterns of development seen in plants growing in space often show more randomized directional growth than on the ground, molecular evidence for altered tropic response reflected in the patterns of transcriptional changes observed in spaceflight has been less clear. Thus, the highlighting of tropisms in Fig. 6c suggests the use of the Matrix approach for analyzing the available data may help reveal these molecular signatures. Further, this analysis revealed that stomatal behavior may be affected by spaceflight. Factors such as reduced buoyancy-driven convection in microgravity would be predicted to alter gas exchange at the stomatal pore5,8, likely playing out as altered stomatal function. Again, this effect has been difficult to reliably detect in the transcriptional fingerprints of spaceflight responses, but the targeted analyses driven by insights from the Matrix appear able to reveal evidence for these previously cryptic patterns of molecular changes. Repeating this analysis made using Metascape24 but with DAVID (the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery25) as an alternative, widely used tool to assess gene ontology enrichments agreed with the analysis outlined above and did not reveal any new significantly enriched ontology terms at p < 0.01. This observation suggests the Metascape analysis outlined in Fig. 6 is likely capturing most of the patterns of ontology enrichment in the data. Fig. 6.

Analysis in c and d performed using Metascape.GLDS-37 and GLDS-38 represent the BRIC samples studied with RNA-seq, necessitating independent analysis from the microarray datasets discussed above. Again, we used data from the published in-house bioinformatics approaches19,20 and the GeneLab common analytical pipeline. Comparison of these approaches in the WT Col-0 samples in both datasets shows that at a threshold of p < 0.01, the common pipeline identified 701 and 951 new loci as showing altered expression in spaceflight from GLDS-37 and GLDS-38 respectively, or about 25% more loci than found in the original authors’ analysis (Table 1 and Supplementary Data 4). Comparing the GeneLab pipeline-based analysis with that of the original peer-reviewed publications indicates agreement on 927 (GLDS-37) and 2404 (GLDS-38) DEGs. Further, within this analysis, 164 loci were significantly differentially expressed in both GLDS-37 and GLDS-38 (Supplementary Data 6). Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of these spaceflight-responsive DEGs across both studies and in both the in-house and GeneLab analytical pipelines (Fig. 6d) revealed enrichment in responses such as to oxidative stress, heat shock and changes in cell wall dynamics that have been highlighted in multiple previous plant spaceflight transcriptome studies (e.g., refs. 14,19,21,22,26,27). Reanalysis with the Matrix approach was also able to reveal a fingerprint of hypoxia which has been predicted as an important factor impacting biology operating with the reduced convective gas movements inherent in a microgravity environment6,7 but which has previously proven difficult to observe in analyses of transcriptional responses of individual flight experiments using the BRIC. In addition, Gene Ontologies related to various aspects of ion transport are prominent in our analysis targeting future investigations focused on both anion and cation transport as likely to be a fruitful targets for further understanding the effects of spaceflight on plants. Lastly, since processes associated with responses to spaceflight are still largely unknown, Supplementary Data 7 provides a list of spaceflight-responsive DEGs from this analysis that currently have no GO or KEGG annotation. These genes provide potential targets for study for novel processes triggered by plant growth in space. We next used Metascape analysis on these lists of DEGs from the analysis of GLDS-37 and GLDS-38 to explore potential protein:protein networks, applying Metascape’s protein-protein interaction enrichment analysis and Molecular Complex Detection (MCode)28. These analyses take the lists of differentially expressed genes and mine an array of protein interaction databases (STRING29, BioGrid30, OmniPath31, InWeb_IM32) for enriched networks of physical interactions. MCode then allows a focus on highly connected hubs when the numbers of proteins in the network become very high. These analyses again revealed enrichment for a response network associated with ion transport and chaperone activity (Fig. 7). In addition, multiple network clusters related to protein ubiquitinylation were identified. This observation suggests spaceflight may have triggered alterations in proteasome activity, possibly related to stress-induced protein turnover. Such a response to stress-related protein dysfunction would be consistent with the elevated chaperone activities suggested by the heat shock protein (HSP)-related protein:protein interaction cluster identified in this same analysis.

Intersection between RNA and microarray analyses By combining the differentially expressed gene lists from both microarray and RNA-seq analyses identified using the GeneLab common pipeline approach, 6 common spaceflight response loci were identified but in only three of the studies (GLDS-37, GLDS-38, and GLDS-121). This observation reinforces the idea that variation in experimental design and analysis approach may be obscuring some common patterns of response (see below). Within the BRIC-19 experiment that generated the data in GLDS-37, in addition to the Col-0 ecotype (also used in GLDS-38) and Ler-0 (also used in GLDS-121), two additional ecotypes were investigated (Cvi-0, Ws-2). These same six genes were also differentially expressed across all the ecotypes in this study, reinforcing their likely common response nature. These 6 common genes were: AT1G74310 (HOT1/HSP101; HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 101), AT1G58340 (ABS4, a plant MATE multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporter), AT5G52310 (COR78; COLD REGULATED 78), AT4G11290 (PRX39, a cell wall peroxidase), AT5G09220 (AAP2, AMINO ACID PERMEASE 2), and AT1G73480 (MAGL4, an α-β hydrolase). Analysis of these loci using the graph-based network analysis tool KnetMiner23 revealed broad connections to the plastid and membrane function (Fig. 8). Fig. 8.

However, the power of the current meta-analysis lies in highlighting these particular genes as possible core markers of the spaceflight response across multiple experiments within the BRIC hardware and revealing a difference in GLDS-17 and GLDS-44. Interrogating the experimental design reveals that one obvious difference between GLDS-17 and the other BRIC investigations is that 3% (w/v) sucrose was used in the seedling media in GLDS-17 compared to 0.3–1% (w/v) in the other studies. Sucrose is generally added to the media of Arabidopsis seedlings to support the heterotrophic growth of the plants in the dark conditions in the BRIC. However, the higher sucrose in BRIC-17 [https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-17] was specifically added to facilitate comparisons between the seedlings in this experiment and a parallel set of cell cultures that required much higher sucrose for growth. The differences in gene expression between BRIC-17 [https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-17] seedlings and the other BRIC experiments then implies that changes in primary metabolism experienced by the etiolated seedlings in the BRIC may be an important factor in determining spaceflight related transcriptional responses, echoing the altered primary metabolism inferred from our meta-analysis across all the spaceflight datasets analyzed as part of the Matrix in Fig. 5. Such observations are especially relevant in the context of possible spaceflight-related hypoxia discussed above. Indeed, Loreti et al.,33 used microarray analysis in ground-based research to investigate the changes that take place in seedlings that experience low oxygen stress with or without the addition of external sucrose. Their analyses revealed that exogenous sucrose significantly alters patterns of anoxia-related transcriptional change. Thus, the increased sucrose concentration in the media found in GLDS-17 should dramatically affect the plant hypoxia response and so is likely to alter responses to this particular effect of the spaceflight environment. Precisely why GLDS-44 also does not show the conserved transcriptional responses seen in GLDS-37, GLDS-38, and GLDS-121 is less obvious as its experimental design is very similar to these other BRIC-based experiments and it was flown side-by-side on the same mission as GLDS-121. However, subtle features such as the seed planting density differed between these studies and so effects of plant density and competition might be superimposed on these results. This analysis then highlights how understanding the feature(s) in these experiments responsible for the differences in expression pattern offers enormous potential to define factors with wide-ranging effects on the plant spaceflight response; i.e., the difference(s) between GLDS-44 and GLDS-121 and the other BRIC experiments clearly had dramatic effects on the patterns of spaceflight-related gene expression and so exploring how these studies differ in design should help define some key spaceflight-response related factors. Looking at the shared DEGs between GLDS-37, GLDS-38, and GLDS-121 identifies HSP101 as a common spaceflight response marker. Indeed, upregulation of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) in the spaceflight environment is well known18,19,27,34,35. Heat Shock Proteins are molecular chaperones associated with protecting and refolding proteins in response to cellular damage36. Consistent with the enriched clades corresponding to photosynthesis identified in Fig. 5, patterns of HSP101 upregulation and its relationship to the chloroplast (Fig. 8), suggest that this protein may play an important role in ameliorating chloroplastic proteotoxic stress possibly resulting from spaceflight-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the plastid. Indeed, the HSP100 family are known to be induced by abiotic stressors such as oxidative stress37 and have even been linked to tolerance to the proteotoxic damage caused by hypoxia38. Previous work14,19 has demonstrated a significant correspondence between patterns of gene expression altered by oxidative damage from the high light stress response on Earth (which is strongly linked to damaging levels of plastid ROS production) and the spaceflight-associated DEGs identified in the seedlings from BRIC experiments. Similarly, the large number of plastid genes responding to spaceflight identified in seedling samples from BRIC-16/GLDS-4422 reinforces the idea that this organelle may be an important site of spaceflight-induced responses. However, it is important to note that the BRIC experiments we have analyzed were all conducted under dark growth conditions. Therefore, the light-driven reactions of photosynthetic electron transport that are a major source of plastid ROS production on Earth are not responsible for these spaceflight-related effects and so the source of any spaceflight-triggered ROS production within the plastid remains to be defined. Our meta-analysis using the common GeneLab analysis pipelines also highlights COR78 as likely a part of a conserved transcriptional response of Arabidopsis on orbit in the BRIC hardware. Although originally identified as a cold induced transcript, COR78 is now known to be highly inducible in response to a range of abiotic factors ranging from wounding and salt exposure to osmotic stress, drought and even the hypobaric (low pressure) environments predicted for future large scale, space-based plant growth facilities39–41. A common feature of all these stressors is that they trigger signaling through ROS and induce oxidative stress. Indeed, COR78 expression is regulated through the same ROS-responsive transcriptional cascades (i.e., H2O2 responsive modulation through the DREB2A transcription factor) that modulates heat shock response elements such as HsfA342, providing a possible link to the heat shock factor component of the spaceflight response. In a further tantalizing link between the chloroplast and COR78 response, COR78 expression is co-regulated with elements of the plastid antioxidant system and indeed, its expression is thought to be tightly linked to the levels of H2O2 processing by the plant43. In summary, the GeneLab database is accumulating an ever-increasing number of datasets that investigate the transcriptional effects of spaceflight on early plant development. This aggregation of information, along with careful curation represents a powerful resource to begin to understand spaceflight responses in these organisms. Spaceflight imposes some commonly encountered and some unique challenges when comparing datasets. Thus, as with all large omics-level analyses, differences in protocols and analysis pipelines can impact the robustness of comparisons. However, spaceflight also leads to further challenges related to an often-restricted capacity for biological replication and with limitations on experimental design dictated by available spaceflight hardware. We have begun to address some of these issues by applying a common analytical pipeline for datasets and then constructing a matrix of metadata to allow for sorting and comparison across studies driven by their known similarities and differences. In this work we focused on two elements to highlight the potential of this approach: (1) making broad comparisons across the entire sets of data to draw conclusions about confounding variables that likely superimpose differences on spaceflight datasets, and (2) making analyses focusing on the commonly used BRIC hardware to help researchers understand the possibilities offered by designing comparative analyses in the context of the Matrix metadata. However, the possible comparisons guided by this Matrix are vast and so there remain many more opportunities for the research community to draw new insights from Matrix-focused analyses. From the Matrix-driven exploration presented here, we found that: (1) comparisons across different transcriptome monitoring technologies (RNA-seq versus microarray) should be performed with great care as differences in the technology used can impose greater variation on results than the biological treatment (spaceflight versus ground control); (2) environmental conditions and hardware-related constraints in the experimental design produce smaller but also important differences that can confound interpretation of the spaceflight versus ground control comparisons; (3) when these factors are controlled for, comparisons across the breadth of spaceflight-related Arabidopsis experiments reveal alterations in general responses to environmental stresses, photosynthesis, and other elements of primary and secondary metabolism (Fig. 5). These broad areas provide targets for the generation of future models of how spaceflight may affect plant physiology and development. Our analysis of the BRIC hardware shows how with a more targeted approach, common response genes can be identified that then point to potentially core spaceflight responses. For example, the BRIC analysis strongly points to the plastid as a likely shared response site across many spaceflight experiments. The observations of conserved roles for HSP101 and COR78 suggest that a fundamental disruption of the ROS and/or antioxidant systems related to the plastid may be accompanying plant growth in space. It is important to note limitations inherent in the approach we have applied to meta-analysis of these spaceflight datasets. Due to flight and hardware constraints, the spaceflight experiments collected for this meta-study were limited to young seedlings of Arabidopsis. Although some experiments have tested the viability of plants to reach mature and reproductive developmental stages these have generally not involved omics research. We must await the data from more studies throughout the phases of the plant life cycle to understand how well our developing insights from seedlings and young plants will apply to individuals at maturity. Similarly, we must await further studies on a wider array of plant species to extend these approaches beyond the plant most commonly grown in spaceflight, Arabidopsis. One further limitation on our approach is that at present we manually curate the import of each experiment’s metadata into the Matrix. However, the GeneLab data repository has standardized its metadata formats for both current and future datasets offering us the opportunity to automate both import and curation. This automated approach will be facilitated through GeneLab’s automatic programming interface (API) which offers a program-accessible link to the metadata files. Continual updates to the Matrix will allow the power of inferences drawn to grow as quickly as the new plant spaceflight datasets are deposited. Our analysis of the BRIC datasets suggests that focusing on a few hardware options that can then be the subject of multiple flight studies would greatly add to the power of such comparative omics-level analyses. Nevertheless, the results presented here offer the promise that as these experimental data become available, meta-analyses across the broad plant biology omics data landscape will provide a powerful approach to supplement the insights drawn from analyses focused on each individual study in isolation. The Matrix analysis presented herein provides a toolset to help expedite the development of such new investigations. Additionally, while the scope of potential hypotheses generated by these analyses is extensive, the current Matrix meta-analysis highlights three specific focus areas for future research that may prove particularly fruitful. These include: (1) studies examining the effect of variable light regimes on space grown plant productivity and physiology, (2) analyses aimed at determining the potential causes of altered redox activities in the plastids of space flown plants, and (3) experiments examining the function of HSP101, ABS4, COR78, PRX39, AAP2, and MAGL4 in response to spaceflight stressors.",

Copyright notice ID: 10027818 PMID: 36941263 Abstract Spaceflight presents a multifaceted environment for plants, combining the effects on growth of many stressors and factors including altered gravity, the influence of experiment hardware, and increased radiation exposure. To help understand the plant response to this complex suite of factors this study compared transcriptomic analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceflight experiments deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s GeneLab data repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing significant differential expression in spaceflight versus ground controls using a single common computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq datasets. Such a standardized approach to analysis should greatly increase the robustness of comparisons made between datasets. This analysis was coupled with extensive cross-referencing to a curated matrix of metadata associated with these experiments. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to define plant reactions to spaceflight. The metadata matrix allows selection of studies with high similarity scores, i.e., that share multiple elements of experimental design, such as plant age or flight hardware. Comparisons between these studies then helps reduce the complexity in drawing conclusions arising from comparisons made between experiments with very different designs. Subject terms: Plant sciences, Genetic databasesIntroduction Spaceflight imposes a unique suite of environmental effects on biology. For example, microgravity severely curtails the signals normally generated on Earth from the intrinsic weight of a plant’s organs1 and by its gravity perceptive cells2–4. By contrast, in the terrestrial environment, these are key factors driving normal growth and development. In addition, gravitational forces on Earth govern a host of physical processes including gas and liquid flow that are important for normal plant function. Thus, the microgravity environment can lead to the development of anoxic regions around metabolically active plant tissues and altered patterns of evaporative and convective cooling that can impact leaf function and physiology5–8. Additionally, the increased radiation exposure inherent in spaceflight is likely to trigger its own array of responses within the plant. The combination of these spaceflight-linked effects is outside the evolutionary history of terrestrial biology and so it remains complicated to predict the effects of spaceflight on organisms. Yet, understanding the molecular and physiological responses of plants to these conditions remains an important goal for space biologists, not the least because plants are integral to many plans for life support on long-duration crewed missions and for colonization9. One way to probe the responses of organisms to spaceflight is by analysis of changes in their transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, genomes and epigenomes induced by exposure to this environment. In the field of plant biology the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab data repository10,11 has aggregated many such omics datasets. Critically, the deposited data are associated with extensive metadata covering elements of each experiment’s design ranging from features of the hardware, radiation exposure and lighting regime to treatment duration, genotype and organism age. Such extensive and accurate metadata are critical to understanding the breadth of differences in experimental designs when making comparisons between studies. This insight is important as the flight hardware used, the analysis methodology employed (e.g., microarray versus RNA-seq for transcriptome studies) and other experimental parameters likely superimpose their own, often poorly defined, influences on the results (so-called batch effects12). Indeed, recent analysis of rodent spaceflight data suggests differences in sample preservation eclipsed spaceflight-driven differences in mouse transcriptional profiling13. However, given the relatively few opportunities to conduct experiments in space, making comparisons between existing studies represents a potentially powerful approach to identify common responses in the often-limited available spaceflight data. We have therefore imported 15 spaceflight-related plant transcriptome datasets from the GeneLab data repository and manually curated the associated metadata to develop a metadata matrix (hereafter, the Matrix). This approach allows the more robust design of comparisons between studies that share commonalities in experimental design. Our meta-analyses broadly confirmed the spaceflight-related changes in cell wall processes and oxidative stress that were highlighted in many of the original publications associated with each individual study. Additionally, Matrix-driven analyses helped reveal new response elements, such as conserved spaceflight-triggered changes in expression of the cold response gene COLD RESPONSIVE 78 (COR78), and likely shifts in ion transport processes. We also identified factors within the experimental design such as choice of flight hardware and especially assay technique (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) that can impose greater differences between datasets than the spaceflight treatment. Thus, the Matrix allows researchers to explore the wealth of plant biology transcriptomic data generated during spaceflight-related studies and provides an approach to better understand underlying factors impacting the robustness of comparisons made between the different datasets.Results and discussion Comparative transcriptomics of plant spaceflight-response data One method to assess the similarities and differences in transcriptome-level responses between different plant spaceflight experiments is to make comparisons using the results of the analyses already presented in the primary literature on each study. This approach can be further expedited using tools, such as the Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database14 that aggregates these analyses into an interactive data exploration environment. Such comparative studies capitalize upon the unique insights of the researchers who performed each experiment and the tailored analytical tools and approaches they then employed to define differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in their original publications. We will refer to these studies as in-house analyses. However, the wide range of analytical pipelines used in such a primary literature-based approach inevitably imposes some limitations on the robustness of any conclusions that can be drawn between studies. This problem arises because differences in gene expression patterns between datasets likely involve both the effects of experimental treatments, such as growing plants in spaceflight versus a ground control, and of elements specific to the different analytical programs and statistical approaches used to analyze the data. Indeed, differences between results from different software packages analyzing the same raw transcriptomics datasets are well-documented in the literature15. Therefore, a complementary methodology was also applied by reanalyzing the plant studies used in our analysis via the common computational pipelines summarized in Fig. 1. A similar strategy of reanalyzing published datasets using a common computational approach has been used in the EMBL-EBI gene Expression Atlas. For example, when these researchers import RNA-seq data, a standardized analysis is performed using the integrated RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline, or iRAP, approach16. Although this analysis pipeline is different from the one we have adopted, the standardizing of analysis across all datasets for the EMBL-EBI gene Expression Atlas is designed with the same goal in mind: to reduce the potential for generating artifacts that are caused by making comparisons between datasets that have been the subject of different initial data analysis methodologies. Fig. 1. Uniform analysis pipeline applied to Arabidopsis GLDS datasets used in this study. Open in a new tab Normalized expression arrays are imported from NASA’s GeneLab repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) and then parsed by the TOAST X-Species Transcriptional Explorer (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/x-species-astrobiology-genelab) for analysis of common features between experiments (cross experiment intersect analysis). The iDEP.92 R-shiny app59 is then used to generate expression heatmaps for clustering, and to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling analysis (MDS), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE), Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) and K-means statistical analyses. Functional analyses are then performed using the online tools at Ensembl GO53, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes)56, AraCyc57 and Reactome58. These data are then visualized as tables and dendrograms of the enriched functional groups that are altered by spaceflight and/or related stimuli.Using our common analysis pipeline approach to comparing DEGs across all the Arabidopsis studies, batch effects (i.e., confounding variables imposing effects on patterns of gene expression over and above those of the spaceflight treatment) became readily evident. Thus, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Euclidean hierarchical clustering revealed that rather than the comparison between of spaceflight and ground control, whether RNA-seq or microarray was used to detect patterns of gene expression is the factor with the largest effect on separating studies (PCA1, explaining 83% of the variance between experiments; Fig. 2a, c). Similar analysis showed the important but lesser impact of lighting environment (Fig. 2b). It is important to note here that we have used a statistical threshold of p < 0.01 to define a DEG. Our analysis pipeline also generates the more stringent adjusted p-value (or q-value) that corrects the p-value for the false discovery rate associated with multiple testing. Although we have analyzed the p-value filtered results to encompass as broad a set of DEGs as possible, q-values are presented in the tables of Supplementary Data, to allow the reader to define DEG lists using this parameter. Similarly, a cut off related to fold-change in expression (such as only evaluating genes showing ≥2-fold change in e.g., spaceflight versus their paired ground control) is often used in the literature to limit the extent of the gene lists being analyzed. Again, we have opted not to apply such a fold-change cut off to maintain the most inclusive list of DEGs for analysis. However, fold-change in expression level is also presented in the Supplementary Data, allowing the reader to filter the gene lists using a fold-change cut off as appropriate for their analyses Fig. 2.

Pairwise factor correlation analysis was performed by inspection of the Matrix in Supplementary Data 1 and manually scoring factors that are similar between different pairs of studies, assigning a value of 1 for each factor shared between a pair and a value of zero if that factor was different. Thus, the more factors in common between a pair of studies, the greater their similarity scores. The full pairwise similarity matrix can be found in Supplementary Data 2. This approach linked the studies using similarity scores reflecting commonalities in the different experimental designs and metadata factors within the datasets in our study. Such network analysis allowed us to further visualize and dissect links between the factors that potentially cause the clustering of studies identified in the PCA (Fig. 2). When represented graphically as links between studies and metadata factors, this analysis demonstrated that hardware and its associated lighting regimes were indeed likely key components that influence clustering of responses in the data (Fig. 4).

Therefore, lighting and hardware are inevitably closely linked in our network analyses of current datasets. This observation also highlights the insight that could be gained by performing more studies that use the same hardware but with a range of lighting environments. Such analyses could help separate hardware-related effects on the plant during growth in space from those specifically triggered by the lighting environment under those conditions. Such network analyses distinguish those studies sharing a high degree of network linkages within the Matrix, i.e., studies with a larger number of common features in their experimental design. Results of comparisons between such highly connected studies are candidates for more robust analyses due to these shared factors. For example, although the overall experimental designs behind GLDS-7, GLDS-37, GLDS-38, and GLDS-120 differ from each other by ecotype, hardware or experiment duration, each links to multiple other spaceflight experiments within the Matrix and form hubs in networks related to hardware and/or tissue sample type (Fig. 3g). Thus, GLDS-7 was performed in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) and is of interest due to the high number of tissues and ecotypes in its experimental design that link to many other studies in the Matrix. GLDS-37 was conducted in the BRIC hardware and is extensively linked to other studies due to the large number of Arabidopsis ecotypes analyzed, as well as the many other Arabidopsis BRIC experiments available for comparison. GLDS-38 (BRIC) provides RNA-seq and paired proteomics data that likewise connect to many other BRIC datasets. GLDS-120 took place with a unique hardware setup (square Petri plates that were attached to the inside wall of the International Space Station), but contains multiple ecotypes, genotypes and light treatments that link it to many other studies in the Matrix. These connections to other studies suggest that comparisons within the local networks where each study acts as a hub are likely to be fruitful targets to extract common spaceflight-related responses. Conversely, such network analyses also revealed studies that are the most distinct (i.e., least shared metadata factors with other Matrix studies). One clear set of such studies are those designed around terrestrial spaceflight analogs such as GLDS-46, GLDS-136, and GLDS-144. These experiments use elements such as hyperbaric chambers, space radiation analog exposures, and microgravity simulation on clinostats and random positioning machines to mimic specific aspects of the spaceflight environment and so are more distant in design to the other spaceflight experiments. Thus, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, pairwise similarity matrix comparisons show spaceflight studies are most similar to other spaceflight studies (average pairwise similarity score of 5.88 ± 1.93) and significantly less similar (p < 0.01) when compared to ground analog studies (average similarity 4.21 ± 1.36), which are most similar to other ground analog studies. This Matrix-driven network visualization then highlights the opportunity to design follow-up experiments that use these analogs of putative spaceflight stressors but where the design of the study is more interconnected to the factors seen in their closest spaceflight studies within the Matrix. Such aligned experimental designs could help increase the robustness of subsequent comparisons to the existing spaceflight data. We next asked if we could define factors within the metadata other than spaceflight treatment that help define clustering within the studies. We therefore took the expression level data for each individual sample replicate (normalized probe fluorescence intensity for microarray and FPKM for RNAseq) from all the studies in the Matrix and calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient for all possible pairwise combinations (Supplementary Data 3). We next calculated the average Pearson’s correlation coefficient from this analysis for each set of replicates within an experiment, providing a measure of correlation for each treatment within a dataset to all other treatments in all datasets in the Matrix. We then sorted these data by each metadata factor within the Matrix to ask if a particular metadata factor stood out as explaining the patterns of correlation within the transcriptomics data. Of these, radiation treatment was the most highly correlated factor (Supplementary Data 3), followed by genotype, tissue/developmental stage, flight hardware and then altered gravity (i.e., spaceflight). This analysis again highlights the likelihood that many experimental factors are imposing patterns on spaceflight transcriptional profiles and reinforces the effects of radiation exposure as a key area for future spaceflight-related experimentation.Mining the Matrix for common patterns of spaceflight-responsive gene expression Insights from the network of connections between the spaceflight-related datasets in the Matrix were then used to make comparisons between gene expression patterns seen in spaceflight treatments and ground control samples (e.g., excluding the ground-based spaceflight analog studies). Having defined the assay type (microarray versus RNA-seq) as one of the most important confounding factors when comparing spaceflight responsive transcripts across multiple datasets (Fig. 2), the microarray and RNA-seq datasets were separated into two parallel analysis pipelines. The data of the DEGs within the two series of datasets was then analyzed using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Unguided WGCNA clustering identified 3 groupings within the microarray datasets and 4 within the RNA-seq data (Fig. 5a–c). Krishnamurthy et al.17 have compared microarray and RNA-seq analyses of identical samples from Arabidopsis roots, concluding that although the two approaches broadly agreed (on ~66% of ~6400 DEGs in their study), RNA-seq analysis revealed significantly more DEGs. Thus, in our study the RNA-seq is likely providing a broader dataset within which to find enriched Gene Ontologies likely leading to the increased number of groupings found by our analysis. Fig. 5. Unguided Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) clustering of the Arabidopsis datasets used in this study. Open in a new tab This analysis was performed on the DEGs identified in the RNA-seq (a) and microarray (c) datasets from the spaceflight experiments imported into the Matrix (see Table 2 for specific datasets used). This analysis identified 4 clusters of DEGs within the RNA-seq (a) and 3 clusters within the microarray analyses (c). b Overlap in the DEGs within each cluster between the WGCNA RNA-seq and microarray analyses. Purple curves link identical genes and light blue curves link genes that, although not identical, belong to the same enriched Gene Ontology term found in each clade.

Analysis made using Metascape24.The top 20 enriched ontology groupings shared between the RNA-seq and microarray analyses are summarized in Fig. 5d and the full set of significantly enriched Gene Ontologies is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. Clade I in both the microarray and RNA-seq stands out as sharing the most common significantly DEGs. When expanding this analysis to include shared significantly enriched Gene Ontology terms (Fig. 5c), terms that broadly cover response to environmental stresses (such as to light, cold and bacteria) are seen (Supplementary Fig. 2). This observation supports the conclusions from numerous previous spaceflight analyses that plants exhibit a suite of stress-related responses when encountering the spaceflight environment. However, a further prominent and novel shared element seen across these analyses is changes in the expression of genes related to photosynthesis, other aspects of primary metabolism and also changes to secondary metabolism (Fig. 5d). This observation suggests that spaceflight and spaceflight-related treatments are likely impacting these fundamental aspects of plant function. However, as a note of caution, this analysis combines the responses across all the diverse plant datasets within the Matrix. Even though the analysis in Fig. 5d is filtered to exclude the broadest Gene Ontology terms (i.e., those terms encompassing more than 100 genes), such wide-ranging analysis might be expected to reveal only the most general common responses, whilst being relatively insensitive to more subtle or specific spaceflight responses. This is because of the variation likely imposed by the wide range of experimental designs encompassed by these datasets, i.e., in addition to spaceflight-related effects a host of other responses are likely superimposed on the data, diluting the signal from some spaceflight responses. It seems likely a similar reason explains the observation that, although there are shared spaceflight enriched gene ontologies between experiments, there is no individual DEG common to all these experiments. The Matrix facilitates a more targeted subset of comparisons between datasets (e.g., chosen based on commonalities in the hardware or plant samples used within each experiment) that might be expected to reduce this experimental design-driven noise to reveal these more specific shared gene groupings. An example of such an analysis described in the following section.Analysis of studies using common hardware: BRIC datasets provide 2 tissue types and 2 transcriptome assay types for meta-analysis The analyses in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that both the specific flight hardware used and its associated lighting regime significantly impact the patterns of gene expression noted in plants in spaceflight. Further, our network analyses (Fig. 3b) show that GLDS-17, GLDS-37, GLDS-38, GLDS-44, and GLDS-121 are all highly connected, especially for these factors. Thus, these studies all used etiolated seedlings grown in the dark in the Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) cassettes of the BRIC hardware. Additionally, samples were harvested at the young seedling stage of development (up to 12 days old) and all included a paired on-orbit and ground control design to allow for exploration of spaceflight-related patterns of DEGs18–22. Differences between the studies include ecotype and analysis type (microarray versus RNA-seq). Nevertheless, their high levels of similarity, especially at the level of the hardware and lighting used, suggested to us that they could provide an important set of similarly designed experimentation to help more robustly reveal common spaceflight responses. Additionally, all these studies have published in-house analyses from their respective research groups, allowing us to further test the relative merits of comparisons drawn between the in-house results from each original publication versus the common analytical pipeline that we have used in this study. Table 1 presents a summary of the total numbers of DEGs detected in these analyses at p ≤ 0.01 alongside the overlap in these gene lists between the in-house and common pipeline analyses (the full lists of DEGs are shown in Supplementary Data 4).

The significance threshold to identify DEGs was set at p < 0.01. In a previous comparative analysis, Johnson et al.23 reported no common genes amongst the BRIC-16 mission microarray studies (GLDS-17, -44 and -121) when using a cutoff of p < 0.01 but also applying a threshold of 5-fold or greater for induction or repression in transcript level as measured on their microarray (to define the most strongly regulated genes). We therefore reanalyzed these microarray results using a pipeline similar to the original authors’ analyses (Affymetrix Express pipeline and the Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error (PLIER) approach for normalization21, with a significance setting p < 0.01) but now using no fold-change filtering (Supplementary Data 4) to be more analogous to the GeneLab analytical pipeline we have also applied. Using the in-house analysis by the researchers (GLDS-1718, GLDS-4422) and the reanalysis of GLDS-12121 using PLIER, the results of our comparisons across all the microarray studies conducted with wild-type seedlings identified 86 spaceflight-related DEGs found across all studies (Supplementary Data 5). The GeneLab reanalysis identified 114 loci in common between the 3 studies, including 85% of the genes from the in-house analysis. Analysis of the 75 DEGs identified in all 3 studies by both analytical techniques using MetaScape24 (Fig. 6) revealed enrichment in Gene Ontology terms including: regionalization, response to Karrikin (a plant stress response pathway triggered by volatiles originally found in smoke), regulation of stomatal movement and tropism. These latter two terms are particularly interesting as disruption of gravitropic growth is one of the predicted responses of plants growing in the microgravity environment of spaceflight. Although patterns of development seen in plants growing in space often show more randomized directional growth than on the ground, molecular evidence for altered tropic response reflected in the patterns of transcriptional changes observed in spaceflight has been less clear. Thus, the highlighting of tropisms in Fig. 6c suggests the use of the Matrix approach for analyzing the available data may help reveal these molecular signatures. Further, this analysis revealed that stomatal behavior may be affected by spaceflight. Factors such as reduced buoyancy-driven convection in microgravity would be predicted to alter gas exchange at the stomatal pore5,8, likely playing out as altered stomatal function. Again, this effect has been difficult to reliably detect in the transcriptional fingerprints of spaceflight responses, but the targeted analyses driven by insights from the Matrix appear able to reveal evidence for these previously cryptic patterns of molecular changes. Repeating this analysis made using Metascape24 but with DAVID (the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery25) as an alternative, widely used tool to assess gene ontology enrichments agreed with the analysis outlined above and did not reveal any new significantly enriched ontology terms at p < 0.01. This observation suggests the Metascape analysis outlined in Fig. 6 is likely capturing most of the patterns of ontology enrichment in the data. Fig. 6.

Analysis in c and d performed using Metascape.GLDS-37 and GLDS-38 represent the BRIC samples studied with RNA-seq, necessitating independent analysis from the microarray datasets discussed above. Again, we used data from the published in-house bioinformatics approaches19,20 and the GeneLab common analytical pipeline. Comparison of these approaches in the WT Col-0 samples in both datasets shows that at a threshold of p < 0.01, the common pipeline identified 701 and 951 new loci as showing altered expression in spaceflight from GLDS-37 and GLDS-38 respectively, or about 25% more loci than found in the original authors’ analysis (Table 1 and Supplementary Data 4). Comparing the GeneLab pipeline-based analysis with that of the original peer-reviewed publications indicates agreement on 927 (GLDS-37) and 2404 (GLDS-38) DEGs. Further, within this analysis, 164 loci were significantly differentially expressed in both GLDS-37 and GLDS-38 (Supplementary Data 6). Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of these spaceflight-responsive DEGs across both studies and in both the in-house and GeneLab analytical pipelines (Fig. 6d) revealed enrichment in responses such as to oxidative stress, heat shock and changes in cell wall dynamics that have been highlighted in multiple previous plant spaceflight transcriptome studies (e.g., refs. 14,19,21,22,26,27). Reanalysis with the Matrix approach was also able to reveal a fingerprint of hypoxia which has been predicted as an important factor impacting biology operating with the reduced convective gas movements inherent in a microgravity environment6,7 but which has previously proven difficult to observe in analyses of transcriptional responses of individual flight experiments using the BRIC. In addition, Gene Ontologies related to various aspects of ion transport are prominent in our analysis targeting future investigations focused on both anion and cation transport as likely to be a fruitful targets for further understanding the effects of spaceflight on plants. Lastly, since processes associated with responses to spaceflight are still largely unknown, Supplementary Data 7 provides a list of spaceflight-responsive DEGs from this analysis that currently have no GO or KEGG annotation. These genes provide potential targets for study for novel processes triggered by plant growth in space. We next used Metascape analysis on these lists of DEGs from the analysis of GLDS-37 and GLDS-38 to explore potential protein:protein networks, applying Metascape’s protein-protein interaction enrichment analysis and Molecular Complex Detection (MCode)28. These analyses take the lists of differentially expressed genes and mine an array of protein interaction databases (STRING29, BioGrid30, OmniPath31, InWeb_IM32) for enriched networks of physical interactions. MCode then allows a focus on highly connected hubs when the numbers of proteins in the network become very high. These analyses again revealed enrichment for a response network associated with ion transport and chaperone activity (Fig. 7). In addition, multiple network clusters related to protein ubiquitinylation were identified. This observation suggests spaceflight may have triggered alterations in proteasome activity, possibly related to stress-induced protein turnover. Such a response to stress-related protein dysfunction would be consistent with the elevated chaperone activities suggested by the heat shock protein (HSP)-related protein:protein interaction cluster identified in this same analysis.

Size of circle shows the number of protein:protein interactions that each node/locus is annotated as being involved with as identified by the MCode analysis.Intersection between RNA and microarray analyses By combining the differentially expressed gene lists from both microarray and RNA-seq analyses identified using the GeneLab common pipeline approach, 6 common spaceflight response loci were identified but in only three of the studies (GLDS-37, GLDS-38, and GLDS-121). This observation reinforces the idea that variation in experimental design and analysis approach may be obscuring some common patterns of response (see below). Within the BRIC-19 experiment that generated the data in GLDS-37, in addition to the Col-0 ecotype (also used in GLDS-38) and Ler-0 (also used in GLDS-121), two additional ecotypes were investigated (Cvi-0, Ws-2). These same six genes were also differentially expressed across all the ecotypes in this study, reinforcing their likely common response nature. These 6 common genes were: AT1G74310 (HOT1/HSP101; HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 101), AT1G58340 (ABS4, a plant MATE multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporter), AT5G52310 (COR78; COLD REGULATED 78), AT4G11290 (PRX39, a cell wall peroxidase), AT5G09220 (AAP2, AMINO ACID PERMEASE 2), and AT1G73480 (MAGL4, an α-β hydrolase). Analysis of these loci using the graph-based network analysis tool KnetMiner23 revealed broad connections to the plastid and membrane function (Fig. 8). Fig. 8.

However, the power of the current meta-analysis lies in highlighting these particular genes as possible core markers of the spaceflight response across multiple experiments within the BRIC hardware and revealing a difference in GLDS-17 and GLDS-44. Interrogating the experimental design reveals that one obvious difference between GLDS-17 and the other BRIC investigations is that 3% (w/v) sucrose was used in the seedling media in GLDS-17 compared to 0.3–1% (w/v) in the other studies. Sucrose is generally added to the media of Arabidopsis seedlings to support the heterotrophic growth of the plants in the dark conditions in the BRIC. However, the higher sucrose in BRIC-17 [https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-17] was specifically added to facilitate comparisons between the seedlings in this experiment and a parallel set of cell cultures that required much higher sucrose for growth. The differences in gene expression between BRIC-17 [https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-17] seedlings and the other BRIC experiments then implies that changes in primary metabolism experienced by the etiolated seedlings in the BRIC may be an important factor in determining spaceflight related transcriptional responses, echoing the altered primary metabolism inferred from our meta-analysis across all the spaceflight datasets analyzed as part of the Matrix in Fig. 5. Such observations are especially relevant in the context of possible spaceflight-related hypoxia discussed above. Indeed, Loreti et al.,33 used microarray analysis in ground-based research to investigate the changes that take place in seedlings that experience low oxygen stress with or without the addition of external sucrose. Their analyses revealed that exogenous sucrose significantly alters patterns of anoxia-related transcriptional change. Thus, the increased sucrose concentration in the media found in GLDS-17 should dramatically affect the plant hypoxia response and so is likely to alter responses to this particular effect of the spaceflight environment. Precisely why GLDS-44 also does not show the conserved transcriptional responses seen in GLDS-37, GLDS-38, and GLDS-121 is less obvious as its experimental design is very similar to these other BRIC-based experiments and it was flown side-by-side on the same mission as GLDS-121. However, subtle features such as the seed planting density differed between these studies and so effects of plant density and competition might be superimposed on these results. This analysis then highlights how understanding the feature(s) in these experiments responsible for the differences in expression pattern offers enormous potential to define factors with wide-ranging effects on the plant spaceflight response; i.e., the difference(s) between GLDS-44 and GLDS-121 and the other BRIC experiments clearly had dramatic effects on the patterns of spaceflight-related gene expression and so exploring how these studies differ in design should help define some key spaceflight-response related factors. Looking at the shared DEGs between GLDS-37, GLDS-38, and GLDS-121 identifies HSP101 as a common spaceflight response marker. Indeed, upregulation of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) in the spaceflight environment is well known18,19,27,34,35. Heat Shock Proteins are molecular chaperones associated with protecting and refolding proteins in response to cellular damage36. Consistent with the enriched clades corresponding to photosynthesis identified in Fig. 5, patterns of HSP101 upregulation and its relationship to the chloroplast (Fig. 8), suggest that this protein may play an important role in ameliorating chloroplastic proteotoxic stress possibly resulting from spaceflight-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the plastid. Indeed, the HSP100 family are known to be induced by abiotic stressors such as oxidative stress37 and have even been linked to tolerance to the proteotoxic damage caused by hypoxia38. Previous work14,19 has demonstrated a significant correspondence between patterns of gene expression altered by oxidative damage from the high light stress response on Earth (which is strongly linked to damaging levels of plastid ROS production) and the spaceflight-associated DEGs identified in the seedlings from BRIC experiments. Similarly, the large number of plastid genes responding to spaceflight identified in seedling samples from BRIC-16/GLDS-4422 reinforces the idea that this organelle may be an important site of spaceflight-induced responses. However, it is important to note that the BRIC experiments we have analyzed were all conducted under dark growth conditions. Therefore, the light-driven reactions of photosynthetic electron transport that are a major source of plastid ROS production on Earth are not responsible for these spaceflight-related effects and so the source of any spaceflight-triggered ROS production within the plastid remains to be defined. Our meta-analysis using the common GeneLab analysis pipelines also highlights COR78 as likely a part of a conserved transcriptional response of Arabidopsis on orbit in the BRIC hardware. Although originally identified as a cold induced transcript, COR78 is now known to be highly inducible in response to a range of abiotic factors ranging from wounding and salt exposure to osmotic stress, drought and even the hypobaric (low pressure) environments predicted for future large scale, space-based plant growth facilities39–41. A common feature of all these stressors is that they trigger signaling through ROS and induce oxidative stress. Indeed, COR78 expression is regulated through the same ROS-responsive transcriptional cascades (i.e., H2O2 responsive modulation through the DREB2A transcription factor) that modulates heat shock response elements such as HsfA342, providing a possible link to the heat shock factor component of the spaceflight response. In a further tantalizing link between the chloroplast and COR78 response, COR78 expression is co-regulated with elements of the plastid antioxidant system and indeed, its expression is thought to be tightly linked to the levels of H2O2 processing by the plant43. In summary, the GeneLab database is accumulating an ever-increasing number of datasets that investigate the transcriptional effects of spaceflight on early plant development. This aggregation of information, along with careful curation represents a powerful resource to begin to understand spaceflight responses in these organisms. Spaceflight imposes some commonly encountered and some unique challenges when comparing datasets. Thus, as with all large omics-level analyses, differences in protocols and analysis pipelines can impact the robustness of comparisons. However, spaceflight also leads to further challenges related to an often-restricted capacity for biological replication and with limitations on experimental design dictated by available spaceflight hardware. We have begun to address some of these issues by applying a common analytical pipeline for datasets and then constructing a matrix of metadata to allow for sorting and comparison across studies driven by their known similarities and differences. In this work we focused on two elements to highlight the potential of this approach: (1) making broad comparisons across the entire sets of data to draw conclusions about confounding variables that likely superimpose differences on spaceflight datasets, and (2) making analyses focusing on the commonly used BRIC hardware to help researchers understand the possibilities offered by designing comparative analyses in the context of the Matrix metadata. However, the possible comparisons guided by this Matrix are vast and so there remain many more opportunities for the research community to draw new insights from Matrix-focused analyses. From the Matrix-driven exploration presented here, we found that: (1) comparisons across different transcriptome monitoring technologies (RNA-seq versus microarray) should be performed with great care as differences in the technology used can impose greater variation on results than the biological treatment (spaceflight versus ground control); (2) environmental conditions and hardware-related constraints in the experimental design produce smaller but also important differences that can confound interpretation of the spaceflight versus ground control comparisons; (3) when these factors are controlled for, comparisons across the breadth of spaceflight-related Arabidopsis experiments reveal alterations in general responses to environmental stresses, photosynthesis, and other elements of primary and secondary metabolism (Fig. 5). These broad areas provide targets for the generation of future models of how spaceflight may affect plant physiology and development. Our analysis of the BRIC hardware shows how with a more targeted approach, common response genes can be identified that then point to potentially core spaceflight responses. For example, the BRIC analysis strongly points to the plastid as a likely shared response site across many spaceflight experiments. The observations of conserved roles for HSP101 and COR78 suggest that a fundamental disruption of the ROS and/or antioxidant systems related to the plastid may be accompanying plant growth in space. It is important to note limitations inherent in the approach we have applied to meta-analysis of these spaceflight datasets. Due to flight and hardware constraints, the spaceflight experiments collected for this meta-study were limited to young seedlings of Arabidopsis. Although some experiments have tested the viability of plants to reach mature and reproductive developmental stages these have generally not involved omics research. We must await the data from more studies throughout the phases of the plant life cycle to understand how well our developing insights from seedlings and young plants will apply to individuals at maturity. Similarly, we must await further studies on a wider array of plant species to extend these approaches beyond the plant most commonly grown in spaceflight, Arabidopsis. One further limitation on our approach is that at present we manually curate the import of each experiment’s metadata into the Matrix. However, the GeneLab data repository has standardized its metadata formats for both current and future datasets offering us the opportunity to automate both import and curation. This automated approach will be facilitated through GeneLab’s automatic programming interface (API) which offers a program-accessible link to the metadata files. Continual updates to the Matrix will allow the power of inferences drawn to grow as quickly as the new plant spaceflight datasets are deposited. Our analysis of the BRIC datasets suggests that focusing on a few hardware options that can then be the subject of multiple flight studies would greatly add to the power of such comparative omics-level analyses. Nevertheless, the results presented here offer the promise that as these experimental data become available, meta-analyses across the broad plant biology omics data landscape will provide a powerful approach to supplement the insights drawn from analyses focused on each individual study in isolation. The Matrix analysis presented herein provides a toolset to help expedite the development of such new investigations. Additionally, while the scope of potential hypotheses generated by these analyses is extensive, the current Matrix meta-analysis highlights three specific focus areas for future research that may prove particularly fruitful. These include: (1) studies examining the effect of variable light regimes on space grown plant productivity and physiology, (2) analyses aimed at determining the potential causes of altered redox activities in the plastids of space flown plants, and (3) experiments examining the function of HSP101, ABS4, COR78, PRX39, AAP2, and MAGL4 in response to spaceflight stressors.Methods Assay pipelines and datasets The GeneLab data repository currently holds the largest number of publicly accessible datasets of omics- (transcriptomics-, proteomics-, epigenomics- and genomics-) based studies of biological, spaceflight-related studies. For our analyses of plant responses using this resource we focused on the results assessing changes in the transcriptome as the most numerous kind of dataset available. We included such studies based on the minimal criteria that they: (1) were performed on the most widely used plant model species, Arabidopsis thaliana (which represents nearly all of the plant data currently deposited in GeneLab) and (2) had at least 3 biological replicates per treatment (to provide statistical rigor on subsequent analyses). A summary of the 15 studies (encompassing 10 microarray and 6 RNA-seq GeneLab Data Sets, or GLDS) that fulfill these requirements is presented in Table 2. These experiments were performed on missions run by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Chinese Space Agency. To ensure the greatest degree of comparability between results, all of the primary data was reanalyzed through common computational approaches developed by GeneLab and implemented in the Galaxy computing environment44. Briefly, the microarray analysis pipeline used the R/Bioconductor software package limma45 to perform differential gene expression analysis. Background correction by the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method and between array normalization by the quantile method46 were performed through the Bioconductor Oligo package47. Gene level estimation was generated using the Maximum Interquartile Range method and annotations were added using the Annotation-Db class gene annotations specific to Arabidopsis thaliana from the Bioconductor repository (www.bioconductor.org). In cases where multiple probes mapped to the same gene ID, representative probes were selected with the highest mean normalized intensity across all samples. Differential gene expression analysis used the linear model fit from the limma R package to perform pairwise comparisons for all groups. For each probe set, the variance of mean signal intensities was estimated, improved by an empirical Bayes method for combining variances of probes showing similar variability, and the significance of the difference between the means was evaluated with a t-test to obtain p-values. p-values were also adjusted to q-values to account for possible errors introduced through multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method48 and so control for the false discovery rate.

The Arabidopsis thaliana Ensembl reference genome TAIR10, release 44, and respective GTF file were used to align trimmed reads with STAR (v2.7.1a) then the aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (v1.3.1). Quantification data was imported to R (v3.6.0) using the tximport package (v1.14.0) and normalized using the DESeq2 (v1.26.0) median of ratios method54. Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 (v1.26.0) and pairwise comparisons of all groups were performed using the Wald test to generate p- and adjusted p-values, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the Bioconductor org.At.tair.db (v3.8.2), STRINGdb (v1.24.0)29, and PANTHER.db (v1.0.4)55 packages. Processing code for each RNA-seq dataset are available at https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNA-seq/GLDS_Processing_Scripts and both the raw and processed data are deposited at https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects. The associated metadata for each dataset was aggregated using a combination of the information provided alongside each GeneLab data submission, parallel manual curation from the literature and through interviews with the primary researchers. The Matrix of this data is available as both Supplementary Data 1 and as an interactive exploration environment developed in the Qlik database management software environment (Qlik Technologies Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA) at https://gilroy-qlik.botany.wisc.edu/a/sense/app/20aa802b-6915-4b1a-87bd-c029a1812e2b. When they have been employed in the data analyses, online tools such as the TOAST X-Species Transcriptional Explorer (https://gilroy-qlik.botany.wisc.edu/a/sense/app/ab2250b5-ee3a-4da8-b5da-fe87d5f2dbe6/overview), KnetMiner23, Metascape24, Ensembl GO53, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes56, AraCyc57 and Reactome58 are noted in the text and figure legends. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling analysis (MDS), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE), Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) and K-means statistical analyses were performed using the iDEP.94 R-package59. For these analyses, the normalized counts were imported from the GeneLab data repository and processed using R-studio. The R programming language provides for the statistical analysis of data (https://www.r-project.org/about.html) within a commercial development environment called R-studio (R-Studio inc. Boston, MA, USA).Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplemental Material (1MB, pdf) Supplementary Data 1 (116.5KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 2 (44.5KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 3 (614.9KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 4 (2.1MB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 5 (17.7KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 6 (51.7KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 7 (10.7KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (1.4MB, pdf) Acknowledgements This work was coordinated through the GeneLab Plant Analysis Working Group and was supported by NASA grants 80NSSC19K0126, 80NSSC18K0132 and 80NSSC21K0577 to S.G. and R.B., through NASA 80NSSC19K1481 to S.W., NNX15AG55G to C.W., and NNX15AG56G to L.D. and N.L., from the Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigación grant RTI2018-099309-B-I00 and ESA 1340112 4000131202/20/NL/PG/pt to R.H.

    "abstract": "Abstract Osteoporosis can profoundly affect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause similar changes, although less is known about lower doses (≤100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively low doses of gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of skeletal aging. Mice (C57BL/6J-10 wk old, male) were irradiated (total body; 0-sham, 1, 10 or 100 cGy 137Cs) and tissues harvested on the day of irradiation, 1 or 4 months later. Microcomputed tomography was used to quantify microarchitecture of high turnover, cancellous bone. Irradiation at 100 cGy caused transient microarchitectural changes over one month that were only evident at longer times in controls (4 months). Ex vivo bone cell differentiation from the marrow was unaffected by gamma radiation. In conclusion, acute ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) exacerbated microarchitectural changes normally found during progressive, postpubertal aging prior to the onset of age-related osteoporosis.",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Osteoporosis can lead to devastating health consequences and poses a substantial health care burden currently affecting an estimated 44 million Americans (). In women, estrogen deficiency is primarily responsible for the rapid postmenopausal loss of bone mass and resulting structural fragility (type I osteoporosis) while a slower bone loss (type II or senile osteoporosis) affects both men and women late in life [1]. Bone structure begins to decline early [2]; peak bone mass is achieved in early adulthood and progressively declines in both high turnover, cancellous tissue and in the surrounding hard cortical shell. The compartments of bone affected by osteoporosis can include both the dense tissue that forms an outer structural shell (cortical bone) and the spongy tissue (cancellous bone) within the marrow cavity; the microarchitecture of cancellous bone is profoundly affected in osteoporosis and renders sites that are rich in cancellous tissue, such as the spine and proximal femur, prone to fracture. An age-related decline in cancellous tissue structure occurs in rodents over a matter of months, rather than years, as in humans. C57BL/6J mice provide a well-established animal model with relatively rapid postpubertal loss of cancellous tissue [3, 4], characteristic of that which precedes the development of senile, type II osteoporosis in humans. Bone turnover is regulated by a balance between the activities of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Osteoblasts progressively differentiate from progenitors and mesenchymal stem cells whereas osteoclasts are haematopoietic derivatives of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Stem cells, progenitors, and precursors of both lineages reside within the bone marrow. Bone marrow cells cultured ex vivo retain behavioral characteristics of in vivo function; thus bone marrow-derived cells cultured under conditions tailored either to stimulate osteoblast differentiation (osteoblastogenesis) or osteoclast differentiation (osteoclastogenesis) are useful tools to dissect cellular and molecular bases of physiological challenges such as skeletal aging and exposure to radiation [5–8]. Ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) both by the ionization of target molecules and by perturbations to the cellular redox state, also implicated in the development of osteoporosis [9–12]. The production of ROS/RNS causes oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, and protein influencing key cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) ionizing radiation (e.g., gamma rays, X-rays) at high cumulative doses (>200 cGy) can damage vascular supply (osteoradionecrosis), leading to loss of cortical and cancellous tissue and leading to skeletal fragility [13], while adverse effects of lower doses (100–200 cGy) appear to be confined to cancellous tissue in animal models [12, 14–16]. Much less is known about how low doses influence skeletal health. Here we hypothesized that low-to-moderate doses of ionizing radiation accelerate postpubertal and progressive loss of microarchitectural integrity over time. Ionizing radiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) caused structural changes in cancellous tissue within one month that occurred over 4 months in controls, with no further decrements following 1 month. The capability of marrow-derived cell populations to differentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts was unaffected.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experiment Design A total of 96 C57BL/6J 10-week old male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed 2/cage for up to 4 months. This age and duration of the experiment were selected on the basis of results reported by others, showing that this encompasses a period of microarchitectural changes that are associated with osteopenia (reduced bone density) over time [3, 4]. Mice were provided food (LabDiet 5001, Purina Mills, Gray Summit, MO) and water ad libitum. After three days of cage acclimation, unanesthetized mice (4 per exposure) were irradiated (IR; JL Shepherd Mark I, 137Cs gamma ray source, San Gabriel, CA) with 1, 10, or 100 cGy at 0.96, 0.96, or 88 cGy/min (±10%), respectively, or were sham-irradiated (0 cGy-controls). The exposure field was 26.5 × 19.5 cm2. To expose samples evenly, mice were placed in container (10 cm radius), centered 18 cm from the source, and rotated at 6 rpm. Radiation dose and uniformity was calibrated in air by JL Shepherd & Associates using an X-ray Monitor (no. 2025, MDH Industries, Monrovia, CA) with a 0.18 cm3 probe (National Institutes of Standards and Technology traceable). Tissues were harvested on the day of IR (basal) or 1 or 4 months later (n = 8/group), with cell culture being performed at the latter two endpoints. As an indicator of health, total body mass was measured (E0D120 scale, Ohaus Corporation, Parsippany, NJ) at least once per week until tissue harvest. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of NASA Ames Research Center approved all procedures. 2.2. Cancellous Microarchitecture Skeletal microarchitecture broadly characterizes the 3D network of cancellous (or spongy) bone. Microcomputed tomography (vivaCT 40, SCANCO Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) allows direct quantification of the microarchitecture of mineralized tissue (10.5 μm voxel size) within the proximal tibia metaphysis [17]. Standard indices [18] were generated within the excised right tibia in a region 0.2 to 1.2 mm distal to the proximal growth plate via semiautonomous contouring of cross-sectional slices, as reported in detail previously [15]. The relative amount of bone to total volume (BV/TV, bone volume fraction) quantifies the amount of bone present. The thickness of the bony struts, the thickness (or spacing) of the marrow voids, and trabecular number characterize trabecular morphologys on average [19]. Connectivity density quantifies the number of trabecular struts per volume in the bony network [20]. The structure model index measures the ratio of rod-like (=3) to plate-like (=0) trabeculae within the tissue [19]. The fabric tensor quantifies the anisotropic orientation of the structure, relating to mechanical properties [21, 22], with three eigenvalues describing the axial lengths of the anisotropy ellipsoid and the degree of anisotropy equaling the ratio of the maximum to minimum eigenvalues. 2.3. Primary Bone Marrow Culture Marrow cells from the hindlimbs (femora and tibiae) were grown as previously described [7]. In brief, cells were flushed from the bone marrow and plated in α-MEM supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum with osteoblastogenic supplements (ascorbate 50 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and β-glycerophosphate (10 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For osteoclastogenesis, cells were plated overnight in macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF, 30 ng/mL, R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN) and nonadherent cells collected, replated, and grown in α-MEM supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum with MCSF (30 ng/mL) and soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (sRANKL, 60 ng/mL, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Osteoclastogenesis was assessed 4-5 days after euthanasia by counting the number of multinucleated, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP+, Sigma Aldrich) cells in a defined area by microscopy (between 18 and 45 mm2) to count a minimum of 200 cells. Osteoblastogenesis was assessed one month after irradiation by quantifying the surface area covered by alizarin red-stained, mineralized nodules. 2.4. Statistics Statistical analyses were performed using JMP 8 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). To address aging, three groups of sham controls were collected at different time points for analysis. Least squares linear regressions were performed with time as regressor and the null hypothesis of the slope being zero to assess changes over time. The coefficient of determination (R 2) and the probability (P) of the slope being zero are reported, with P = 0.05 the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. For each time point after-irradiation, comparisons were made between the sham-irradiated and irradiated mice. Analyses proceeded using one-factor ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer Honestly Significant Difference post hoc test, and P = 0.05 considered the threshold for significance. All figures report mean ± standard deviation (SD).",
    "results": "3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Body Mass Body weights were measured weekly during the experiment. Sham-irradiated mice gained 10% body mass from 10–14 wk of age (Figure 1. inset, R 2 = 0.96, P < 0.05 for slope) and 30% body mass from 10–27 wk of age (R 2 = 0.99, P < 0.05 for slope). Compared to the age-matched controls, irradiation at any dose did not affect the mass accrual (Figure 1). These data are consistent with previous studies that monitored radiation and aging effects [3, 4] and show that normal accrual of body mass, as a broad measure of health over time at this age, was unimpeded by exposure to gamma irradiation with these doses. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Mouse body mass as a function of age and radiation exposure.

Male C57BL/6 mice (10 weeks of age, n = 8/group) were irradiated at 1, 10, and 100 cGy or were sham-irradiated (0 cGy) on day 0 and tissues harvested 1 month (inset) or 4 months after irradiation. Mean ± SD. #Denotes P < 0.05 for changes with age (linear regression) for the respective cohorts (1 and 4 months after irradiation). 3.2. Cancellous Microarchitecture: Temporal Changes Cancellous microarchitecture was evaluated using 3D microcomputed tomography. In sham-control mice, the cancellous bone volume fraction remained constant (Figure 2(a)), bone density increased, and most microarchitectural parameters declined as the mice aged over the 4-month period of this study. Trabecular number (−21%, R 2 = 0.79, P < 0.05) and connectivity density (−49%, R 2 = 0.75, P < 0.05) declined over 4 months (Figures 2(d) and 2(e)). Structure model index was unchanged within 4 months (Figure 2(f)). Each eigenvalue of the anisotropy tensor increased (all P < 0.05) within 4 months. The maximum eigenvalue increased 15%, R 2 = 0.30 (Figure 2(g)). The minimum eigenvalue increased 24%, R 2 = 0.49 (data not shown). The remaining eigenvalue increased 23%, R 2 = 0.59 (data not shown). The degree of anisotropy remained constant at 2.0 indicating a persistent longitudinal orientation of the structure (Figure 2(h)). In contrast to these indicators of increasing structural fragility with aging, trabecular thickness (+22%, R 2 = 0.35, P < 0.05) as in [3], and tissue density (+9%, R 2 = 0.59, P < 0.05) rose over 4 months (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Cancellous microarchitecture of the proximal tibial metaphysis as a function of age and radiation exposure at the time of irradiation (basal, 0 months) and 1 and 4 months after irradiation. During aging, sham-irradiated controls show relative bone volume (BV/TV) remaining constant (a), increases in tissue density (b) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th*) (c), and declines in trabecular number (Tb.N*) (d) and connectivity density (Conn.D) (e). The ratio of trabecular rods to plates, the structure model index (SMI), remains constant with age (f). The maximum eigenvalue (|H2|) of the fabric tensor increases with age (g), with the degree of anisotropy (h) remaining constant. At 1 month after irradiation, 100 cGy reduced Tb.N* by 20% (d), Conn.D by 36% (e) compared to age-matched controls. Irradiation at 100 cGy, but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy, altered cancellous structure within 1 month in a direction and magnitude similar to 4 months of normal aging, with no further modulation between 1 and 4 months after irradiation. Mean ± SD. *Denotes P < 0.05 for changes with IR dose (ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer posthoc compared to age-matched sham controls). #Denotes P < 0.05 for changes with age (linear regression).We observed age-related changes in the cancellous microarchitecture of the tibia within the 4-month timeframe. In our study, declines in trabecular number and connectivity density ensued, while relative bone volume, rod-like morphology and degree of anisotropy remained constant. Concurrently, the cancellous tissue consolidated gains into thicker and denser, though fewer, trabecular struts. Trabeculae were spaced farther apart with age (data not shown) and may increase the propensity for strut buckling [23, 24]. These changes are consistent with normal aging of male C57BL/6 mice, including declines of trabecular number and connectivity density, which appeared to start sooner and fall more rapidly with aging than the bone volume fraction [3, 4]. In sum, these data suggest that age-related alterations of microarchitecture within the mouse tibia may precede overt declines in cancellous bone volume. 3.3. Cancellous Microarchitecture: Ionizing Radiation-Induced Changes Radiation doses of 1 cGy or 10 cGy had no discernible effect on skeletal microarchitecture at either 1 or 4 months after-IR. In 100 cGy-IR mice, trabecular number and connectivity density declined (−20% and −36%, resp.; P < 0.05) and trabecular spacing and the maximum eigenvalues of the fabric tensor increased (+28% and +21%, resp.; P < 0.05) at one month after-IR compared to age-matched controls (Figure 2). There were no additional decrements in microarchitecture compared to age-matched controls between 1 and 4 months after-IR (Figure 2). These results indicate that 100 cGy irradiation caused rapid removal of trabecular, which resembled the normal microarchitectural changes expected to occur during 4 months of aging. Irradiation with 100 cGy caused reductions in trabecular number and connectivity density and increases in the major axis of the anisotropy ellipsoid within 1 month—changes that take 4 months to appear in sham-irradiated controls. In previous studies that used older mice (16 weeks of age), 100 cGy caused bone loss in the tibia via reduced trabecular thickness, but not trabecular number, with the onset of osteopenia appearing 10 days after-irradiation [15]. The 16-week-old mice are past peak cancellous bone volume in the tibia, whereas the 10-week-old mice in this study have not yet begun to decline. Microarchitectural changes following irradiation observed in this study resembled the effects of a larger dose in older, male mice (16 weeks, 200 cGy) within the lumbar spine (a denser, plate-like cancellous tissue) [15] and in the tibia (unpublished results), where gamma irradiation at 200 cGy caused vertebral and tibial bone loss via trabecular number and connectivity density decrements appearing within 3 days and persisting at least until 30 days after-irradiation. This supports trabecular thinning preceding strut removal during bone resorption. Furthermore, in young female mice (9 weeks), osteopenia and trabecular number and connectivity density decrements persist in the tibia at 120 days after-irradiation [14]. Taken together, the data indicate that bone resorption is a time-dependent process contingent on initial bone volume and morphology (i.e., structure model index) and that skeletal outcome is a function of age. In this study, microarchitectural differences between irradiated and age-matched controls were not evident 4 months after exposure to 100 cGy radiation. This result contrasts to the persistence of osteopenia in the tibia after low LET irradiation at higher doses (≥200 cGy X-ray or gamma rays) or with particulate irradiation at doses of 100 cGy (proton) [25] and 200 cGy (56Fe) [14] which present at 120 days after-irradiation in female mice (9 weeks). These findings highlight the importance of age at the time of irradiation; gender also may influence skeletal radioresponses and further study is needed in this area. 3.4. Bone Cell Differentiation Potential To assess differentiation of osteoblast lineage progenitors and precursors in the mesenchymal stem cell lineage, adherent cells from bone marrow were cultured in osteogenic medium up to one month and then stained for mineralized nodules (Figure 3). Irradiation did not affect the area covered by mineralized nodules (Figure 3(a)). These data suggest the osteoblast progeny of irradiated cells are not affected by a single, acute dose of low LET, ionizing radiation. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Bone-cell differentiation potential as a function of age and radiation exposure. Hindlimb bone marrow was flushed and cultured under osteoblastogenic or osteoclastogenic conditions to assess differentiation potential of the marrow. Between 1 and 4 months of aging (white columns), osteoblastogenesis (a), measured as the area of calcified matrix per well, and osteoclastogenesis (b), measured as number of TRAP-positive, multinuclear (≥3/cell) cells per area, remained constant in sham-control mice. Irradiation, at any dose (gray or black columns), did not affect the differentiation potential of bone cells in the marrow at 1 (not shown) or 4 months post-IR (a, b). Images of alizarin red-stained mineralized nodules (c) and TRAP-stained osteoclasts (d).Bone marrow cells were cultured after tissue harvest in osteoclastogenic media and then osteoclast number counted. In sham-irradiated controls, between 1 and 4 months after-IR, the density of osteoclasts remained constant (Figure 3(b)) and indicates the number of precursors did not vary with age. Furthermore, irradiation at any dose did not affect the differentiation potential of osteoclasts compared to controls. Per animal, the ratio of nodule area fraction to osteoclast density was calculated as a measure of the balance between formation and resorption potential; this was unchanged in controls between 1 and 4 months and unchanged after irradiation at any dose (data not shown). Thus, neither osteoblastogenesis nor osteoclastogenesis by bone marrow cells was affected by gamma irradiation, consistent with our previous findings. These results suggest the ability of marrow-derived progenitors to contribute to skeletal remodeling is preserved, despite exposure to ionizing radiation. Gamma rays or X-rays (200 cGy) can cause a rapid (within 3 days) increase in the numbers of osteoclasts lining the surfaces of trabeculae [15, 16], and a decrement in actively mineralizing surfaces, an index of the activity of mature, active osteoblasts [12]. Taken together, our results suggest that mature cells of the osteoblast and osteoclast lineage, rather than progenitors, are responsible for the near-term microarchitectural changes triggered by gamma radiation. A limitation of this study design is that bones were analyzed at only two time points after exposure to radiation. Additional timepoints would be useful to further characterize the influence of radiation on age-related changes in skeletal health.",

    "conclusion": "4. Conclusions A moderate dose (100 cGy) of gamma radiation accelerated changes in the trabecular microarchitecture of postpubertal, growing (10 wk old) male C57BL/6 mice at a rate comparable to later skeletal aging in controls, whereas no effects were observed at even lower doses (1 or 10 cGy). Together with the finding that BV/TV did not differ over this time, these results suggest age-related microarchitectural changes precede bone loss. Bone marrow-derived osteoblast progenitors and osteoclast precursors did not appear to be affected by the low-to-moderate doses of low LET gamma radiation used here, suggesting stem and progenitor cells that reside in the marrow will retain the ability to contribute to skeletal remodeling during subsequent aging following the low-to-moderate doses employed. In contrast, exposure to high doses of gamma radiation [6] or to high LET irradiation such as 56Fe can inflict acute and persistent damage to osteoprogenitors ([7], unpublished observations). In conclusion, ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) appeared to accelerate structural changes in the murine skeleton, expected also to occur during progressive, postpubertal aging in humans prior to the onset of type II osteoporosis.",

Copyright notice ID: 3337602 PMID: 22570786 Abstract Osteoporosis can profoundly affect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause similar changes, although less is known about lower doses (≤100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively low doses of gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of skeletal aging. Mice (C57BL/6J-10 wk old, male) were irradiated (total body; 0-sham, 1, 10 or 100 cGy 137Cs) and tissues harvested on the day of irradiation, 1 or 4 months later. Microcomputed tomography was used to quantify microarchitecture of high turnover, cancellous bone. Irradiation at 100 cGy caused transient microarchitectural changes over one month that were only evident at longer times in controls (4 months). Ex vivo bone cell differentiation from the marrow was unaffected by gamma radiation. In conclusion, acute ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) exacerbated microarchitectural changes normally found during progressive, postpubertal aging prior to the onset of age-related osteoporosis.1. Introduction Osteoporosis can lead to devastating health consequences and poses a substantial health care burden currently affecting an estimated 44 million Americans (). In women, estrogen deficiency is primarily responsible for the rapid postmenopausal loss of bone mass and resulting structural fragility (type I osteoporosis) while a slower bone loss (type II or senile osteoporosis) affects both men and women late in life [1]. Bone structure begins to decline early [2]; peak bone mass is achieved in early adulthood and progressively declines in both high turnover, cancellous tissue and in the surrounding hard cortical shell. The compartments of bone affected by osteoporosis can include both the dense tissue that forms an outer structural shell (cortical bone) and the spongy tissue (cancellous bone) within the marrow cavity; the microarchitecture of cancellous bone is profoundly affected in osteoporosis and renders sites that are rich in cancellous tissue, such as the spine and proximal femur, prone to fracture. An age-related decline in cancellous tissue structure occurs in rodents over a matter of months, rather than years, as in humans. C57BL/6J mice provide a well-established animal model with relatively rapid postpubertal loss of cancellous tissue [3, 4], characteristic of that which precedes the development of senile, type II osteoporosis in humans. Bone turnover is regulated by a balance between the activities of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Osteoblasts progressively differentiate from progenitors and mesenchymal stem cells whereas osteoclasts are haematopoietic derivatives of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Stem cells, progenitors, and precursors of both lineages reside within the bone marrow. Bone marrow cells cultured ex vivo retain behavioral characteristics of in vivo function; thus bone marrow-derived cells cultured under conditions tailored either to stimulate osteoblast differentiation (osteoblastogenesis) or osteoclast differentiation (osteoclastogenesis) are useful tools to dissect cellular and molecular bases of physiological challenges such as skeletal aging and exposure to radiation [5–8]. Ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) both by the ionization of target molecules and by perturbations to the cellular redox state, also implicated in the development of osteoporosis [9–12]. The production of ROS/RNS causes oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, and protein influencing key cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) ionizing radiation (e.g., gamma rays, X-rays) at high cumulative doses (>200 cGy) can damage vascular supply (osteoradionecrosis), leading to loss of cortical and cancellous tissue and leading to skeletal fragility [13], while adverse effects of lower doses (100–200 cGy) appear to be confined to cancellous tissue in animal models [12, 14–16]. Much less is known about how low doses influence skeletal health. Here we hypothesized that low-to-moderate doses of ionizing radiation accelerate postpubertal and progressive loss of microarchitectural integrity over time. Ionizing radiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) caused structural changes in cancellous tissue within one month that occurred over 4 months in controls, with no further decrements following 1 month. The capability of marrow-derived cell populations to differentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts was unaffected.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experiment Design A total of 96 C57BL/6J 10-week old male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed 2/cage for up to 4 months. This age and duration of the experiment were selected on the basis of results reported by others, showing that this encompasses a period of microarchitectural changes that are associated with osteopenia (reduced bone density) over time [3, 4]. Mice were provided food (LabDiet 5001, Purina Mills, Gray Summit, MO) and water ad libitum. After three days of cage acclimation, unanesthetized mice (4 per exposure) were irradiated (IR; JL Shepherd Mark I, 137Cs gamma ray source, San Gabriel, CA) with 1, 10, or 100 cGy at 0.96, 0.96, or 88 cGy/min (±10%), respectively, or were sham-irradiated (0 cGy-controls). The exposure field was 26.5 × 19.5 cm2. To expose samples evenly, mice were placed in container (10 cm radius), centered 18 cm from the source, and rotated at 6 rpm. Radiation dose and uniformity was calibrated in air by JL Shepherd & Associates using an X-ray Monitor (no. 2025, MDH Industries, Monrovia, CA) with a 0.18 cm3 probe (National Institutes of Standards and Technology traceable). Tissues were harvested on the day of IR (basal) or 1 or 4 months later (n = 8/group), with cell culture being performed at the latter two endpoints. As an indicator of health, total body mass was measured (E0D120 scale, Ohaus Corporation, Parsippany, NJ) at least once per week until tissue harvest. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of NASA Ames Research Center approved all procedures.2.2. Cancellous Microarchitecture Skeletal microarchitecture broadly characterizes the 3D network of cancellous (or spongy) bone. Microcomputed tomography (vivaCT 40, SCANCO Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) allows direct quantification of the microarchitecture of mineralized tissue (10.5 μm voxel size) within the proximal tibia metaphysis [17]. Standard indices [18] were generated within the excised right tibia in a region 0.2 to 1.2 mm distal to the proximal growth plate via semiautonomous contouring of cross-sectional slices, as reported in detail previously [15]. The relative amount of bone to total volume (BV/TV, bone volume fraction) quantifies the amount of bone present. The thickness of the bony struts, the thickness (or spacing) of the marrow voids, and trabecular number characterize trabecular morphologys on average [19]. Connectivity density quantifies the number of trabecular struts per volume in the bony network [20]. The structure model index measures the ratio of rod-like (=3) to plate-like (=0) trabeculae within the tissue [19]. The fabric tensor quantifies the anisotropic orientation of the structure, relating to mechanical properties [21, 22], with three eigenvalues describing the axial lengths of the anisotropy ellipsoid and the degree of anisotropy equaling the ratio of the maximum to minimum eigenvalues.2.3. Primary Bone Marrow Culture Marrow cells from the hindlimbs (femora and tibiae) were grown as previously described [7]. In brief, cells were flushed from the bone marrow and plated in α-MEM supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum with osteoblastogenic supplements (ascorbate 50 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and β-glycerophosphate (10 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For osteoclastogenesis, cells were plated overnight in macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF, 30 ng/mL, R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN) and nonadherent cells collected, replated, and grown in α-MEM supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum with MCSF (30 ng/mL) and soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (sRANKL, 60 ng/mL, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Osteoclastogenesis was assessed 4-5 days after euthanasia by counting the number of multinucleated, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP+, Sigma Aldrich) cells in a defined area by microscopy (between 18 and 45 mm2) to count a minimum of 200 cells. Osteoblastogenesis was assessed one month after irradiation by quantifying the surface area covered by alizarin red-stained, mineralized nodules.2.4. Statistics Statistical analyses were performed using JMP 8 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). To address aging, three groups of sham controls were collected at different time points for analysis. Least squares linear regressions were performed with time as regressor and the null hypothesis of the slope being zero to assess changes over time. The coefficient of determination (R 2) and the probability (P) of the slope being zero are reported, with P = 0.05 the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. For each time point after-irradiation, comparisons were made between the sham-irradiated and irradiated mice. Analyses proceeded using one-factor ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer Honestly Significant Difference post hoc test, and P = 0.05 considered the threshold for significance. All figures report mean ± standard deviation (SD).3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Body Mass Body weights were measured weekly during the experiment. Sham-irradiated mice gained 10% body mass from 10–14 wk of age (Figure 1. inset, R 2 = 0.96, P < 0.05 for slope) and 30% body mass from 10–27 wk of age (R 2 = 0.99, P < 0.05 for slope). Compared to the age-matched controls, irradiation at any dose did not affect the mass accrual (Figure 1). These data are consistent with previous studies that monitored radiation and aging effects [3, 4] and show that normal accrual of body mass, as a broad measure of health over time at this age, was unimpeded by exposure to gamma irradiation with these doses. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Mouse body mass as a function of age and radiation exposure. Experiment to determine whether a single dose of 137Cs gamma rays causes age-related changes in skeletal structure and bone cell differentiation. Male C57BL/6 mice (10 weeks of age, n = 8/group) were irradiated at 1, 10, and 100 cGy or were sham-irradiated (0 cGy) on day 0 and tissues harvested 1 month (inset) or 4 months after irradiation. Mean ± SD. #Denotes P < 0.05 for changes with age (linear regression) for the respective cohorts (1 and 4 months after irradiation).3.2. Cancellous Microarchitecture: Temporal Changes Cancellous microarchitecture was evaluated using 3D microcomputed tomography. In sham-control mice, the cancellous bone volume fraction remained constant (Figure 2(a)), bone density increased, and most microarchitectural parameters declined as the mice aged over the 4-month period of this study. Trabecular number (−21%, R 2 = 0.79, P < 0.05) and connectivity density (−49%, R 2 = 0.75, P < 0.05) declined over 4 months (Figures 2(d) and 2(e)). Structure model index was unchanged within 4 months (Figure 2(f)). Each eigenvalue of the anisotropy tensor increased (all P < 0.05) within 4 months. The maximum eigenvalue increased 15%, R 2 = 0.30 (Figure 2(g)). The minimum eigenvalue increased 24%, R 2 = 0.49 (data not shown). The remaining eigenvalue increased 23%, R 2 = 0.59 (data not shown). The degree of anisotropy remained constant at 2.0 indicating a persistent longitudinal orientation of the structure (Figure 2(h)). In contrast to these indicators of increasing structural fragility with aging, trabecular thickness (+22%, R 2 = 0.35, P < 0.05) as in [3], and tissue density (+9%, R 2 = 0.59, P < 0.05) rose over 4 months (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Cancellous microarchitecture of the proximal tibial metaphysis as a function of age and radiation exposure at the time of irradiation (basal, 0 months) and 1 and 4 months after irradiation. During aging, sham-irradiated controls show relative bone volume (BV/TV) remaining constant (a), increases in tissue density (b) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th*) (c), and declines in trabecular number (Tb.N*) (d) and connectivity density (Conn.D) (e). The ratio of trabecular rods to plates, the structure model index (SMI), remains constant with age (f). The maximum eigenvalue (|H2|) of the fabric tensor increases with age (g), with the degree of anisotropy (h) remaining constant. At 1 month after irradiation, 100 cGy reduced Tb.N* by 20% (d), Conn.D by 36% (e) compared to age-matched controls. Irradiation at 100 cGy, but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy, altered cancellous structure within 1 month in a direction and magnitude similar to 4 months of normal aging, with no further modulation between 1 and 4 months after irradiation. Mean ± SD. *Denotes P < 0.05 for changes with IR dose (ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer posthoc compared to age-matched sham controls). #Denotes P < 0.05 for changes with age (linear regression).We observed age-related changes in the cancellous microarchitecture of the tibia within the 4-month timeframe. In our study, declines in trabecular number and connectivity density ensued, while relative bone volume, rod-like morphology and degree of anisotropy remained constant. Concurrently, the cancellous tissue consolidated gains into thicker and denser, though fewer, trabecular struts. Trabeculae were spaced farther apart with age (data not shown) and may increase the propensity for strut buckling [23, 24]. These changes are consistent with normal aging of male C57BL/6 mice, including declines of trabecular number and connectivity density, which appeared to start sooner and fall more rapidly with aging than the bone volume fraction [3, 4]. In sum, these data suggest that age-related alterations of microarchitecture within the mouse tibia may precede overt declines in cancellous bone volume.3.3. Cancellous Microarchitecture: Ionizing Radiation-Induced Changes Radiation doses of 1 cGy or 10 cGy had no discernible effect on skeletal microarchitecture at either 1 or 4 months after-IR. In 100 cGy-IR mice, trabecular number and connectivity density declined (−20% and −36%, resp.; P < 0.05) and trabecular spacing and the maximum eigenvalues of the fabric tensor increased (+28% and +21%, resp.; P < 0.05) at one month after-IR compared to age-matched controls (Figure 2). There were no additional decrements in microarchitecture compared to age-matched controls between 1 and 4 months after-IR (Figure 2). These results indicate that 100 cGy irradiation caused rapid removal of trabecular, which resembled the normal microarchitectural changes expected to occur during 4 months of aging. Irradiation with 100 cGy caused reductions in trabecular number and connectivity density and increases in the major axis of the anisotropy ellipsoid within 1 month—changes that take 4 months to appear in sham-irradiated controls. In previous studies that used older mice (16 weeks of age), 100 cGy caused bone loss in the tibia via reduced trabecular thickness, but not trabecular number, with the onset of osteopenia appearing 10 days after-irradiation [15]. The 16-week-old mice are past peak cancellous bone volume in the tibia, whereas the 10-week-old mice in this study have not yet begun to decline. Microarchitectural changes following irradiation observed in this study resembled the effects of a larger dose in older, male mice (16 weeks, 200 cGy) within the lumbar spine (a denser, plate-like cancellous tissue) [15] and in the tibia (unpublished results), where gamma irradiation at 200 cGy caused vertebral and tibial bone loss via trabecular number and connectivity density decrements appearing within 3 days and persisting at least until 30 days after-irradiation. This supports trabecular thinning preceding strut removal during bone resorption. Furthermore, in young female mice (9 weeks), osteopenia and trabecular number and connectivity density decrements persist in the tibia at 120 days after-irradiation [14]. Taken together, the data indicate that bone resorption is a time-dependent process contingent on initial bone volume and morphology (i.e., structure model index) and that skeletal outcome is a function of age. In this study, microarchitectural differences between irradiated and age-matched controls were not evident 4 months after exposure to 100 cGy radiation. This result contrasts to the persistence of osteopenia in the tibia after low LET irradiation at higher doses (≥200 cGy X-ray or gamma rays) or with particulate irradiation at doses of 100 cGy (proton) [25] and 200 cGy (56Fe) [14] which present at 120 days after-irradiation in female mice (9 weeks). These findings highlight the importance of age at the time of irradiation; gender also may influence skeletal radioresponses and further study is needed in this area.3.4. Bone Cell Differentiation Potential To assess differentiation of osteoblast lineage progenitors and precursors in the mesenchymal stem cell lineage, adherent cells from bone marrow were cultured in osteogenic medium up to one month and then stained for mineralized nodules (Figure 3). Irradiation did not affect the area covered by mineralized nodules (Figure 3(a)). These data suggest the osteoblast progeny of irradiated cells are not affected by a single, acute dose of low LET, ionizing radiation. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Bone-cell differentiation potential as a function of age and radiation exposure. Hindlimb bone marrow was flushed and cultured under osteoblastogenic or osteoclastogenic conditions to assess differentiation potential of the marrow. Between 1 and 4 months of aging (white columns), osteoblastogenesis (a), measured as the area of calcified matrix per well, and osteoclastogenesis (b), measured as number of TRAP-positive, multinuclear (≥3/cell) cells per area, remained constant in sham-control mice. Irradiation, at any dose (gray or black columns), did not affect the differentiation potential of bone cells in the marrow at 1 (not shown) or 4 months post-IR (a, b). Images of alizarin red-stained mineralized nodules (c) and TRAP-stained osteoclasts (d).Bone marrow cells were cultured after tissue harvest in osteoclastogenic media and then osteoclast number counted. In sham-irradiated controls, between 1 and 4 months after-IR, the density of osteoclasts remained constant (Figure 3(b)) and indicates the number of precursors did not vary with age. Furthermore, irradiation at any dose did not affect the differentiation potential of osteoclasts compared to controls. Per animal, the ratio of nodule area fraction to osteoclast density was calculated as a measure of the balance between formation and resorption potential; this was unchanged in controls between 1 and 4 months and unchanged after irradiation at any dose (data not shown). Thus, neither osteoblastogenesis nor osteoclastogenesis by bone marrow cells was affected by gamma irradiation, consistent with our previous findings. These results suggest the ability of marrow-derived progenitors to contribute to skeletal remodeling is preserved, despite exposure to ionizing radiation. Gamma rays or X-rays (200 cGy) can cause a rapid (within 3 days) increase in the numbers of osteoclasts lining the surfaces of trabeculae [15, 16], and a decrement in actively mineralizing surfaces, an index of the activity of mature, active osteoblasts [12]. Taken together, our results suggest that mature cells of the osteoblast and osteoclast lineage, rather than progenitors, are responsible for the near-term microarchitectural changes triggered by gamma radiation. A limitation of this study design is that bones were analyzed at only two time points after exposure to radiation. Additional timepoints would be useful to further characterize the influence of radiation on age-related changes in skeletal health.4. Conclusions A moderate dose (100 cGy) of gamma radiation accelerated changes in the trabecular microarchitecture of postpubertal, growing (10 wk old) male C57BL/6 mice at a rate comparable to later skeletal aging in controls, whereas no effects were observed at even lower doses (1 or 10 cGy). Together with the finding that BV/TV did not differ over this time, these results suggest age-related microarchitectural changes precede bone loss. Bone marrow-derived osteoblast progenitors and osteoclast precursors did not appear to be affected by the low-to-moderate doses of low LET gamma radiation used here, suggesting stem and progenitor cells that reside in the marrow will retain the ability to contribute to skeletal remodeling during subsequent aging following the low-to-moderate doses employed. In contrast, exposure to high doses of gamma radiation [6] or to high LET irradiation such as 56Fe can inflict acute and persistent damage to osteoprogenitors ([7], unpublished observations). In conclusion, ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) appeared to accelerate structural changes in the murine skeleton, expected also to occur during progressive, postpubertal aging in humans prior to the onset of type II osteoporosis.Acknowledgments Research was supported by a DOE-NASA Interagency Award no.

    "abstract": "Abstract Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone-resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deficits. To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays (137Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions (56Fe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ≥10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, Rankl/Opg, in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-resorption balance. In the marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, strongly correlated with expression levels of Nfatc1, Csf1, Tnf, and Rankl. Radiation exposure increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week). We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.",
    "introduction": "Introduction During a spaceflight beyond the Earth's protective magnetosphere, astronauts are exposed to a complex mixture of ionizing radiation (Durante and Cucinotta 2011), including low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and protons, as well as more damaging high-LET radiation. Exposure to space radiation is characterized by relatively low doses (≤2 Gy) of ion species due to solar particle events (Shurshakov and others 1999; Parsons and Townsend 2000) or galactic cosmic rays (Zeitlin and others 2013; Hassler and others 2014). Simulated space radiation at these doses causes a rapid net decline in cancellous bone volume to total volume as well as a decrement relative to age-matched controls (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010). The bone loss is associated with increased osteoclast numbers and resorbing surfaces of osteoclasts lining trabeculae (Hamilton and others 2006; Alwood and others 2010; Kondo and others 2010; Willey and others 2010; Yumoto and others 2010; Lloyd and others 2012). Doses in the range of 1–2 Gy also are relevant to radiotherapy; total therapeutic doses can vary, but total body doses of 10–15 Gy typically are fractionated into single doses of ∼2 Gy, which ultimately can lead to increased fracture incidence (Baxter and others 2005). Exposure to radiation, particularly high-LET particles, has the potential to exacerbate the deleterious effects of musculoskeletal disuse, which occurs during prolonged bed rest or spaceflight (LeBlanc and others 2000; Lang and others 2004, 2006; Keyak and others 2009; Alwood and others 2010; Yumoto and others 2010). Previous work shows that radiation exposure elicits a transient (<2 weeks) pro-resorptive state in cancellous tissue, resulting in net bone loss compared with basal (time of radiation) and age-matched controls (Kondo and others 2010; Willey and others 2010; Alwood and others 2012). Bone-resorbing osteoclasts are thought to cause the rapid (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010; Turner and others 2013) cancellous strut losses following simulated space irradiation, leading to loss of microarchitectural integrity (Alwood and others 2010). Radiation exposure transiently and markedly increases the numbers of osteoclasts and the extent of cancellous surfaces covered by osteoclasts. However, the role that receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), the principal osteoclastogenic cytokine, plays in concert with other pro-osteoclastic inflammatory cytokines (Kim and others 2006; Takayanagi 2007; Boyce and Xing 2008) and oxidative stress is not fully understood with respect to the cancellous bone loss following radiation exposure (Kondo and others 2009). Total body irradiation (≤2 Gy) causes time-dependent changes in the bone formation by osteoblasts, although these changes do not account for the early and rapid decrement in bone mass observed following exposure to total body irradiation within this dose range. Within 3 days of exposure to radiation, the net bone formation rate to bone surface (BFR/BS) is unaffected (Kondo and others 2010). Although radiation does affect osteoblast function within the first week of exposure, as indicated by an observed increase in mineral apposition rate (MAR), a concomitant reduction in the mineralizing surface yields no net change in the bone formation rate (Kondo and others 2010). Similarly, Willey and others (2010) also report increased MAR within the first week after exposure, but subsequently BFR/BS declines by 2 and 3 weeks after exposure to 2 Gy X-ray, while Turner and others reported transient increased bone formation even after very high doses of radiation (6 Gy). Therefore, radiation-induced changes in bone formation are more likely to contribute to later remodeling deficits rather than acute bone loss. To better understand net bone loss in the acute response to radiation exposure, we examined the temporal expression within both marrow and mineralized tissue of Rankl and select pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines implicated in various models of inflammatory bone loss (Braun and Schett 2012) following exposure to low- or high-LET species of radiation. Furthermore, we investigated the temporal expression of a key antioxidant transcription factor (nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2,-like 2, Nfe2l2), which is responsible for mounting a rapid defense against oxidative challenges (Kobayashi and Yamamoto 2005) and is known to play a role in dampening osteoclastogenesis (Hyeon and others 2013). We hypothesized that radiation exposure induces expression of pro-osteoclastogenic, pro-inflammatory, and antioxidant genes within both marrow and mineralized tissue compartments and increases markers of bone resorption. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these changes are likely to contribute to later cancellous bone loss. This work shows an acute and time-dependent elevation of Rankl, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Mcp1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf) gene expression in the marrow or in skeletal compartments due to low- or high-LET irradiation. These molecular changes precede (<3 days) the manifestation of bone loss (3–7 days) following iron irradiation at a dose relevant to fractionated radiotherapy or space missions.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animals Post-pubescent (16 weeks±4 days at time of irradiation), male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were individually housed and provided food (LabDiet 5001) and water ad libitum, as described elsewhere (Yumoto and others 2010). Animals were euthanized by CO2 inhalation or anesthetized with isoflurane, followed by blood draw through cardiac puncture. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees for NASA Ames Research Center and Brookhaven National Laboratory approved all procedures. Experiment design and radiation exposure Experiments were conducted to determine the temporal changes in the levels of key genes and circulating proteins related to bone resorption in the latency period before the onset of overt structural loss. To evaluate heavy-ion effects, conscious mice were exposed to high-LET iron ions (56Fe, 600 MeV/ion, 5cGy or 2 Gy, at a rate of 5 or 0.50–1.10 Gy/min, respectively) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, or were sham irradiated as previously described (n=5–8/group). Mice were euthanized and tissues harvested at baseline (ie, time of irradiation) or 3 or 7 days after exposure. To evaluate gamma radiation effects, conscious mice were irradiated with low-LET 137Cs gamma rays [2 Gy, 0.80 Gy/min, as described in detail in Kondo and others (2010)] or were sham irradiated. Euthanasia and tissue harvest took place 4 h or 1 day (±2 h), 3 days, or 7 days after exposure (n=5–7/group). Bone microarchitecture Bone volume and microarchitecture of the proximal tibial metaphysis were quantified by microcomputed tomography (6.8 μm pixel size, 3,500 ms integration time, 50 kV, Skyscan 1174; Bruker microCT) similar to Kondo and others (2009). Briefly, a 1.0-mm thick region located 0.24 mm distal to the proximal growth plate of the tibia was selected and semiautonomously contoured to include cancellous tissue. To assess bone loss, the bone volume to total volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, μm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, μm) were calculated and reported following conventional guidelines (Bouxsein and others 2010). qRT-PCR for gene expression within marrow and skeletal tissue Femora and tibiae were dissected, cleaned of soft tissues, flushed of bone marrow with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored in RNALater (Qiagen, Inc.) at −80°C. Bone marrow cells were lysed and preserved with guanidine-thiocyanate-containing RLT buffer (Qiagen, Inc.) with 1% beta-mercaptoethanol at −80°C. RNA was extracted from homogenized bone or marrow lysates using Trizol (Ambion), QIAshredder, and an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.). For each tissue, RNA was treated with an RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality and quantity were determined using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop). The RNA quality was confirmed by electrophoresis using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Following the manufacturer's recommendations, RNA was reversed transcribed and simultaneously used for qPCR using the GoTaq® Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega). Portions of the following mouse gene sequences were amplified using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Inc.): receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl, assay ID: Mm00441906_m1), Osteoprotegerin (Opg, assay ID: Mm01205928_m1), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf, assay ID: Mm00443260_g1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Mcp1, assay ID: Mm00441242_m1), interleukin-6 (Il6, assay ID Mm00446190_m1), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (Acp5, assay ID: Mm00475698_m1), cathepsin-K (Ctk, assay ID: Mm00484039_m1), nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1, assay ID: Mm00479445_m1), nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2,-like 2 (Nfe2l2, assay ID: Mm00477784_m1), and colony-stimulating factor 1 (Csf1, assay ID: Mm00432686_m1). We standardized gene expression levels to mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 (L19, assay ID: Mm02601633_g1) to correct for differences in cellular input and RNA quality and facilitate comparison between samples. Hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt1, assay ID: Mm01545399_m1) and transmembrane protein 40 (Tmem40, assay ID: Mm00460636_m1) also were analyzed as alternate housekeeping genes. The reactions were performed in the 7300 RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems) or SmartCycler real-time PCR system (Cepheid). We analyzed multiple candidate housekeeping genes for normalization, including L19, Hprt1, and Tmem40. Gamma radiation exposure did not modulate levels of the gene L19 at the various time points, but transiently and modestly increased gene expression of Hprt1 (-0.4 cycles, 1.4-fold) and Tmem40 (-1 cycle, 2.3-fold). Following iron irradiation, L19 (as well as Hprt1) showed small increases in cycle number due to treatment (-0.4 cycles, 1.4-fold for L19). As these differences in housekeeping gene expression were small relative to those of cytokine and resorption marker levels, results reported were normalized relative to L19 for both gamma and iron irradiation experiments. Serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b Blood was collected from the heart at the time of euthanasia and serum was separated and stored at −80°C until processed. Enzyme immunoassays were performed for measurement of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP 5b), a biomarker for osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, using a commercial kit (Immunodiagnostic Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Statistics All data are reported as mean±standard deviation. To determine significant differences compared with sham-irradiated controls, a 1-way analysis of variance was used followed by Dunnett's post hoc test. If data were determined to be heteroscedastic (Bartlett's test), a Welch's ANOVA test followed by a post hoc test using the Bonferroni correction were used to determine significant differences from the sham-irradiated controls. Correlation analyses were performed on expression levels of select genes from marrow and bone specimens following gamma irradiation (for the sham and 1, 3, and 7 day endpoints) using the Pearson's product-moment coefficient (r). A P value ≤0.05 was accepted as significant for all analyses. All analyses were performed using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS).",
    "results": "Results Cancellous microarchitecture following iron irradiation To determine the extent of bone loss over the short term, mice were irradiated with 56Fe ions (600 MeV) or were sham irradiated (0 Gy controls), then 7 days later bones were harvested and cancellous microarchitecture in the proximal tibia quantified ex vivo using 3D microcomputed tomography. Body weights of irradiated and control animals at the time of tissue harvest did not differ (data not shown). Compared with sham controls, irradiation with 2 Gy reduced BV/TV by 16%, Tb.N by 15%, and showed a trend of increased Tb.Sp by 11% (P=0.053, ANOVA), but did not affect trabecular thickness (Fig. 1). This is consistent with previous reports (Hamilton and others 2006; Alwood and others 2010). We included a basal group in our experiments showing BV/TV of 25.1%±3.6%, which was not different from the age-matched sham control group. A lower dose of iron (5 cGy) failed to elicit changes in bone structural parameters compared with controls and is therefore below the threshold dose for causing bone loss (data not shown). These results validate the model of ionizing radiation-induced cancellous bone loss. FIG. 1. Open in a new tab 2 Gy iron irradiation caused acute bone loss in the tibial metaphysis by 7 days through removal of trabecular struts. (A) Bone volume fraction (BV/TV), (B) trabecular number (Tb.N), (C) trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and (D) trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp). Data are mean±SD, with * denoting P<0.05 versus sham. Marrow gene expression following iron irradiation To determine if irradiation altered expression of various pro-osteoclastogenic genes, mRNA levels in bone marrow cell lysates were measured using quantitative RT-PCR 3 days after exposure to high-LET iron or sham irradiation. Within 3 days of exposure, iron irradiation increased expression of the Rankl gene by 9.2-fold compared with sham-irradiated controls (Fig. 2). At this time point, transcripts of Opg and Mcp1 were not detected in the marrow (data not shown). Radiation exposure did not alter Tnf expression (Fig. 2). In contrast, a lower dose of iron (5 cGy) did not elicit changes in gene expression (data not shown). These data demonstrated that high-LET particulate irradiation with 2 Gy elicited pro-osteoclastogenic cytokine expression in the bone marrow tissue. FIG. 2. Open in a new tab 2 Gy iron irradiation effects on cytokine gene expression in tibial marrow cells on day 3 (expression level normalized to L19). Radiation exposure increased the gene expression levels of (A) Rankl. Gene expression levels of (B) Tnf were unchanged. Data are mean±SD, with ** denoting P<0.01 versus sham. Gene expression of skeletal tissue following iron irradiation To determine if ionizing radiation altered expression of select genes related to osteoclastogenesis (Rankl, Opg) and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (Ctk, Acp5) in cells within the mineralized compartment of skeletal tissue, RNA was purified from bone after removal of the marrow (leaving predominantly osteocytes). Within 3 days, iron irradiation increased expression of Rankl by 1.9-fold, Acp5 by 1.5-fold, and Ctk by 2.1-fold over sham controls (Fig. 3). Expression levels of Opg did not change. The ratio of Rankl/Opg expression increased 2.8-fold, which provides a relative index that, on balance, cytokine levels favored increased bone resorption. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab 2 Gy iron irradiation effects on gene expression in tibial tissue (sans marrow) by day 3. Comparison of expression levels of (A) Rankl, (B) Opg, (C) Rankl/Opg, (D) Acp5, and (E) Ctk genes after iron irradiation compared with controls (expression level normalized to L19). Data are mean±SD, with ** denoting P<0.01 versus sham. Marrow gene expression following gamma irradiation To determine whether irradiation altered osteoclastogenic and inflammation-related genes, mRNA expression was measured in bone marrow at 4 h or 1, 3, or 7 days after low-LET gamma irradiation and in sham-irradiated controls. Within 4 h, 2 Gy gamma irradiation elevated Rankl in bone marrow by 2.6-fold over the sham; gene expression of Opg was undetectable regardless of treatment (data not shown). Subsequently, the expression of many genes of interest measured in bone marrow (Rankl, Csf1, Nfatc1, Tnf, Mcp1, and Il6) transiently increased within 1 day and subsequently declined toward sham levels (Fig. 4). Expression of Tnf remained elevated through day 3 post-irradiation, while high Rankl expression persisted through day 7 post-irradiation. FIG. 4. Open in a new tab 2 Gy gamma radiation increased expression of pro-osteoclastic and resorption-related genes in pooled tibial and femoral marrow (expression level normalized to L19). Time course (+1, +3, and+7 days post-irradiation) for the following genes compared with sham control: (A) Rankl, (B) Opg, (C) Rankl/Opg, (D) Csf1, (E) Nfatc1, (F) Tnf, (G) Mcp1, (H) Il6, and (I) Nfe2l2. Data are mean±SD, with * denoting P<0.05 and **P<0.01 versus sham and # denoting P=0.061 for the ANOVA.At their peak, expression of pro-osteoclastogenic genes, Rankl and Csf1, and the osteoclast-related transcription factor, Nfatc1, increased by 4.1-fold, 4.2-fold, and 2.0-fold, respectively (Fig. 4A, D, E); the Rankl decoy receptor Opg showed a trend toward increased expression by 11.3-fold (P=0.053 by ANOVA, Fig. 4B); pro-inflammatory genes Tnf, Mcp1, and Il6 increased by 1.7-fold, 11.9-fold, and 1.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 4F, G, H), relative to controls. The ratio of Rankl/Opg increased by 1.8-fold at day 7 after irradiation (Fig. 4C). Additionally, radiation exposure showed a trend toward increased gene expression of Nfe2l2 by 1.6-fold on day 1 compared with controls (P=0.061 for the ANOVA, Fig. 4I). Notably, levels of Nfe2l2 expression were strongly and positively correlated with the osteoclast-related genes Nfatc1 (P<0.05, r=0.89), Csf1 (P<0.05, r=0.63), Tnf (P<0.05, r=0.62), and Rankl (P<0.05, r=0.56). These data show the temporal dependence of changes in cytokine gene expression in the marrow following radiation exposure. Gene expression of skeletal tissue following gamma irradiation Following gamma irradiation, mRNA levels in femoral mineralized tissue (sans marrow) were quantified at 3 and 7 days after irradiation or sham using qRT-PCR normalized to the housekeeping gene, L19, as shown in Fig. 5. Within 3 days, gamma radiation exposure increased the expression of Rankl (2.3-fold), Acp5 (2.2-fold), and Ctk (2.3-fold). Expression of Tnf, Opg, Nfe2l2, and the Rankl/Opg ratio was not changed (Fig. 5). These data suggest that bone-embedded and/or lining cells contribute to osteoclast stimulation and provide evidence for elevated expression of osteoclastogenic (Rankl) and resorption-related (Acp5, Ctk) genes in the skeletal tissue. FIG. 5. Open in a new tab 2 Gy gamma irradiation increased gene expression in femoral and tibial tissue (sans marrow) by day 3. Comparison of expression levels of (A) Rankl, (B) Opg, (C) Rankl/Opg, (D) Acp5, (E) Ctk, (F) Tnf, and (G) Nfe2l2 genes after iron irradiation compared with controls (expression level normalized to L19). Data are mean±SD, with * denoting P<0.05 and ** denoting P<0.01 versus sham. Serum TRACP 5b following gamma irradiation To determine if temporal changes in skeletal gene expression (Figs. 4 and 5) coincide with changes in a protein biomarker of resorption, the circulating levels of osteoclast-specific TRACP 5b were measured at 1, 3, and 7 days after gamma irradiation and in sham controls. Gamma irradiation increased TRACP 5b serum levels by 34% on day 1 and 17% on day 3 compared with sham, with a subsequent gradual decline toward control levels by day 7 (data not shown). Thus, circulating TRACP 5b levels showed a similar time course, although lower in magnitude compared with skeletal gene expression for Rankl and other pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines.",
    "discussion": "Discussion To better understand the mechanisms underlying radiation-induced stimulation of bone resorption, we investigated molecular signals within the latency period between radiation exposure and the manifestation of cancellous tissue loss. In summary, the results show that exposure to either gamma or heavy-ion radiation increased gene expression for the canonical osteoclastogenic factor, Rankl, as well as other pro-osteoclast cytokines (Mcp1, Tnf, Il6); this occurred in both marrow and mineralized tissue. These findings do not distinguish between changes in gene expression levels due to a shift in the cell population expressing osteoclastogenic cytokines, a generally higher level of expression for all the cells, or some combination of both. In fact, after exposure to radiation of sufficient dosage, there are pronounced, if transient, changes in marrow cell viability and increases in marrow macrophages, which are likely to contribute to the generation of new osteoclasts. Therefore, we interpret our results to show that exposure to ionizing radiation increased the tissue concentrations of mRNA levels generally so as to favor osteoclastogenesis. Radiation-induced changes in cytokine expression were temporally related to changes in several indices of bone resorption, including gene expression (Ctk, Acp5, Nfatc1) and a serum biomarker (TRACP 5b levels). In addition, marrow expression of the global antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, showed high correlation with the expression levels of several osteoclast-related genes. These data indicate that the activation of oxidative defenses and of osteoclast formation was temporally associated in response to radiation exposure. Our previous work showed radiation-induced oxidative damage presents later, at 10 days after exposure (Kondo and others 2010). Taken together, our results indicate that Nfe2l2-related antioxidant defense pathways were insufficient to prevent oxidative damage in bone. Changes in gene expression (as early as 4 h or 1 day) preceded bone loss, which manifested in these experiments by day 7 after exposure to 2 Gy iron, although in some cases such as gamma irradiation and lower doses of iron, decrements in cancellous bone volume can be observed as early as 3 days after exposure (Kondo and others 2009; Yumoto and others 2010). Furthermore, a dose threshold was observed, as 5 cGy iron exposure failed to elicit changes in cytokine gene expression in the marrow or cancellous bone structure (data not shown); these findings provide additional indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis that early induction of osteoclastogenic cytokine gene expression by biologically effective doses of radiation leads to cancellous bone loss. Together, the results demonstrate that radiation-induced structural changes were associated with a marrow environment favoring stimulation of osteoclast differentiation and activity by Rankl and other inflammation-related cytokines as follows: Radiation increased gene expression levels for pro-osteoclastogenic signaling molecules (Csf1, Rankl, Tnf), as well as a trend toward increasing antiosteoclastogenic molecules (Opg), in the marrow and mineralized tissue of irradiated mice compared with sham controls. Iron irradiation elevated the ratio of Rankl/Opg in both the marrow and skeletal tissue by day 3, whereas after gamma irradiation, the ratio was elevated in the marrow at 4 h and then again at day 7. A rapid stimulation of Rankl expression by irradiation in the marrow and bone compartment, potentially from hematopoietic lineage cells (Pacifici 2010, 2012; Fumoto and others 2014) or stromal lineage cells (Suda and others 1999; Boyle and others 2003), is consistent with studies that used radiotherapeutic doses and regimens. In young mice, a single dose of 5 or 10 Gy increased Rankl/Opg in whole femora within 3 days (Han and others 2014). Using mice deficient in the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, radiation exposure at high dose (20 Gy) increased RNA expression for Rankl in cultured osteoblasts grown ex vivo, but this was not observed in cells from wild-type mice (Rana and others 2012). These findings suggest an Nfe2l2-mediated increase in expression of antioxidant enzymes may dampen bone resorption responses to radiation. Furthermore, when a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) capable of differentiating into osteoclast-like cells after RANKL treatment is exposed to ionizing radiation (2 Gy gamma), gene expression levels rise for β3 integrin, an adhesion receptor that is important for osteoclast differentiation, as well as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (Rank), the receptor for Rankl on osteoclasts (Yang and others 2012). In other in vitro work, irradiation with 2 or 4 Gy increases Rankl in differentiated, MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells (Yang and others 2013). Our work is the first to demonstrate the time course of radiation-induced changes in expression of various osteoclastogenic cytokines following 2 Gy exposure (both low- and high-LET) with subsequent bone loss and within the upper range of space-relevant doses and types of radiation. Ionizing radiation also increased tissue expression of pro-inflammatory, osteoclastogenic ligands, Mcp1, Tnf, and Il6, which are all factors generally thought to stimulate osteoclast activity (Takayanagi 2007) in the presence of RANKL (Kostenuik and Shalhoub 2001; Yu and others 2004; Kim and others 2005, 2006; Sul and others 2012; Liu and others 2013). In some reports, TNF may act independently of RANKL to stimulate osteoclastogenesis (Kobayashi and others 2000). Our results are consistent with other work showing that in vivo exposure to ionizing radiation leads to rapid, complex, and interrelated sequence of signals constituting an immune-related cytokine response in bone marrow (Schaue and McBride 2010; Willey and others 2011; Schaue and others 2012; Buchwald and Aurora 2013). At a very high dose (10 Gy), which is sufficient to ablate the bone marrow of hematopoietic cells, radiation causes bone loss related to elevated fractalkine expression by vascular endothelial cells, inflammatory cytokines Tnf, interleukin 1 beta, and interferon gamma, and recruitment of preosteoclasts (CD11b) (Han and others 2014). Additionally, the time course of cytokine and resorption-related gene expression shown in this study coincides with that of marrow cell death and repopulation (Otsuka and others 2008; Kondo and others 2010), suggesting a possible relationship between an expanded population of marrow macrophages clearing apoptotic cells and debris after irradiation, the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclasts, and increased resorption activity. Taken together, these data lead us to propose a 2-stage process for radiation-induced osteoclastogenesis: first, radiation-induced gene expression of osteoclastogenic cytokines leads to enrichment of the marrow with osteoclast precursors (monocyte–macrophage, myeloid lineage cells) and drives differentiation into osteoclasts, and, second, that inflammation-related cytokines co-stimulate differentiating and mature osteoclasts. As a functional measure of active osteoclasts, we provide evidence that 2 Gy gamma irradiation elevated circulating levels of osteoclast-specific TRACP 5b protein, indicative of increased bone resorption. In this work, the radiation-induced elevation in serum TRACP 5b returned to control levels by day 7 following exposure, These results are consistent with those reported by Willey and others (2010, 2011) showing that X-irradiation (2 Gy) of female mice increases circulating TRACP 5b levels 1, 3, and 7 days after irradiation. Radiation-induced decrements in cancellous tissue observed in these experiments were consistent with our previous results. Acute cancellous bone loss temporally manifests on day 3 at a dose as low as 10 cGy iron (Yumoto and others 2010). Persistent structural decrements (lasting >1 week) manifest at doses above ∼50 cGy iron (Yumoto and others 2010) and 1 Gy gamma exposure (Hamilton and others 2006; Kondo and others 2010) before being overtaken, in the case of gamma irradiation, by age-related bone loss (Alwood and others 2012). Taken together, given the observed time course of skeletal gene expression and serum resorption markers, we conclude that the structural deficits arose from a spike in osteoclastogenic cytokine expression that follows exposure to ionizing radiation (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010). Limitations of this work include the dose rate used to model space radiation. It is an open question whether lower dose rate exposures that constitute true space radiation stimulate osteoclasts and bone loss to the same extent as the exposures used here. In addition, other signaling molecules, including various other cytokines not studied here, are likely also to play a role in regulating bone resorption after challenge with ionizing radiation, while changes in osteoblast lineage cells are likely to be important for maintaining structural integrity at later times post-irradiation. In conclusion, an improved understanding of the molecular response to radiation exposure may aid the development of biological treatments to mitigate potentially deleterious skeletal consequences during space flight.",

Copyright notice ID: 4490751 PMID: 25734366 Abstract Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone-resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deficits. To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays (137Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions (56Fe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ≥10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, Rankl/Opg, in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-resorption balance. In the marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, strongly correlated with expression levels of Nfatc1, Csf1, Tnf, and Rankl. Radiation exposure increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week). We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.Introduction During a spaceflight beyond the Earth's protective magnetosphere, astronauts are exposed to a complex mixture of ionizing radiation (Durante and Cucinotta 2011), including low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and protons, as well as more damaging high-LET radiation. Exposure to space radiation is characterized by relatively low doses (≤2 Gy) of ion species due to solar particle events (Shurshakov and others 1999; Parsons and Townsend 2000) or galactic cosmic rays (Zeitlin and others 2013; Hassler and others 2014). Simulated space radiation at these doses causes a rapid net decline in cancellous bone volume to total volume as well as a decrement relative to age-matched controls (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010). The bone loss is associated with increased osteoclast numbers and resorbing surfaces of osteoclasts lining trabeculae (Hamilton and others 2006; Alwood and others 2010; Kondo and others 2010; Willey and others 2010; Yumoto and others 2010; Lloyd and others 2012). Doses in the range of 1–2 Gy also are relevant to radiotherapy; total therapeutic doses can vary, but total body doses of 10–15 Gy typically are fractionated into single doses of ∼2 Gy, which ultimately can lead to increased fracture incidence (Baxter and others 2005). Exposure to radiation, particularly high-LET particles, has the potential to exacerbate the deleterious effects of musculoskeletal disuse, which occurs during prolonged bed rest or spaceflight (LeBlanc and others 2000; Lang and others 2004, 2006; Keyak and others 2009; Alwood and others 2010; Yumoto and others 2010). Previous work shows that radiation exposure elicits a transient (<2 weeks) pro-resorptive state in cancellous tissue, resulting in net bone loss compared with basal (time of radiation) and age-matched controls (Kondo and others 2010; Willey and others 2010; Alwood and others 2012). Bone-resorbing osteoclasts are thought to cause the rapid (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010; Turner and others 2013) cancellous strut losses following simulated space irradiation, leading to loss of microarchitectural integrity (Alwood and others 2010). Radiation exposure transiently and markedly increases the numbers of osteoclasts and the extent of cancellous surfaces covered by osteoclasts. However, the role that receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), the principal osteoclastogenic cytokine, plays in concert with other pro-osteoclastic inflammatory cytokines (Kim and others 2006; Takayanagi 2007; Boyce and Xing 2008) and oxidative stress is not fully understood with respect to the cancellous bone loss following radiation exposure (Kondo and others 2009). Total body irradiation (≤2 Gy) causes time-dependent changes in the bone formation by osteoblasts, although these changes do not account for the early and rapid decrement in bone mass observed following exposure to total body irradiation within this dose range. Within 3 days of exposure to radiation, the net bone formation rate to bone surface (BFR/BS) is unaffected (Kondo and others 2010). Although radiation does affect osteoblast function within the first week of exposure, as indicated by an observed increase in mineral apposition rate (MAR), a concomitant reduction in the mineralizing surface yields no net change in the bone formation rate (Kondo and others 2010). Similarly, Willey and others (2010) also report increased MAR within the first week after exposure, but subsequently BFR/BS declines by 2 and 3 weeks after exposure to 2 Gy X-ray, while Turner and others reported transient increased bone formation even after very high doses of radiation (6 Gy). Therefore, radiation-induced changes in bone formation are more likely to contribute to later remodeling deficits rather than acute bone loss. To better understand net bone loss in the acute response to radiation exposure, we examined the temporal expression within both marrow and mineralized tissue of Rankl and select pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines implicated in various models of inflammatory bone loss (Braun and Schett 2012) following exposure to low- or high-LET species of radiation. Furthermore, we investigated the temporal expression of a key antioxidant transcription factor (nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2,-like 2, Nfe2l2), which is responsible for mounting a rapid defense against oxidative challenges (Kobayashi and Yamamoto 2005) and is known to play a role in dampening osteoclastogenesis (Hyeon and others 2013). We hypothesized that radiation exposure induces expression of pro-osteoclastogenic, pro-inflammatory, and antioxidant genes within both marrow and mineralized tissue compartments and increases markers of bone resorption. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these changes are likely to contribute to later cancellous bone loss. This work shows an acute and time-dependent elevation of Rankl, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Mcp1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf) gene expression in the marrow or in skeletal compartments due to low- or high-LET irradiation. These molecular changes precede (<3 days) the manifestation of bone loss (3–7 days) following iron irradiation at a dose relevant to fractionated radiotherapy or space missions.Materials and Methods Animals Post-pubescent (16 weeks±4 days at time of irradiation), male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were individually housed and provided food (LabDiet 5001) and water ad libitum, as described elsewhere (Yumoto and others 2010). Animals were euthanized by CO2 inhalation or anesthetized with isoflurane, followed by blood draw through cardiac puncture. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees for NASA Ames Research Center and Brookhaven National Laboratory approved all procedures.Experiment design and radiation exposure Experiments were conducted to determine the temporal changes in the levels of key genes and circulating proteins related to bone resorption in the latency period before the onset of overt structural loss. To evaluate heavy-ion effects, conscious mice were exposed to high-LET iron ions (56Fe, 600 MeV/ion, 5cGy or 2 Gy, at a rate of 5 or 0.50–1.10 Gy/min, respectively) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, or were sham irradiated as previously described (n=5–8/group). Mice were euthanized and tissues harvested at baseline (ie, time of irradiation) or 3 or 7 days after exposure. To evaluate gamma radiation effects, conscious mice were irradiated with low-LET 137Cs gamma rays [2 Gy, 0.80 Gy/min, as described in detail in Kondo and others (2010)] or were sham irradiated. Euthanasia and tissue harvest took place 4 h or 1 day (±2 h), 3 days, or 7 days after exposure (n=5–7/group).Bone microarchitecture Bone volume and microarchitecture of the proximal tibial metaphysis were quantified by microcomputed tomography (6.8 μm pixel size, 3,500 ms integration time, 50 kV, Skyscan 1174; Bruker microCT) similar to Kondo and others (2009). Briefly, a 1.0-mm thick region located 0.24 mm distal to the proximal growth plate of the tibia was selected and semiautonomously contoured to include cancellous tissue. To assess bone loss, the bone volume to total volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, μm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, μm) were calculated and reported following conventional guidelines (Bouxsein and others 2010).qRT-PCR for gene expression within marrow and skeletal tissue Femora and tibiae were dissected, cleaned of soft tissues, flushed of bone marrow with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored in RNALater (Qiagen, Inc.) at −80°C. Bone marrow cells were lysed and preserved with guanidine-thiocyanate-containing RLT buffer (Qiagen, Inc.) with 1% beta-mercaptoethanol at −80°C. RNA was extracted from homogenized bone or marrow lysates using Trizol (Ambion), QIAshredder, and an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.). For each tissue, RNA was treated with an RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality and quantity were determined using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop). The RNA quality was confirmed by electrophoresis using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Following the manufacturer's recommendations, RNA was reversed transcribed and simultaneously used for qPCR using the GoTaq® Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega). Portions of the following mouse gene sequences were amplified using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Inc.): receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl, assay ID: Mm00441906_m1), Osteoprotegerin (Opg, assay ID: Mm01205928_m1), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf, assay ID: Mm00443260_g1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Mcp1, assay ID: Mm00441242_m1), interleukin-6 (Il6, assay ID Mm00446190_m1), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (Acp5, assay ID: Mm00475698_m1), cathepsin-K (Ctk, assay ID: Mm00484039_m1), nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1, assay ID: Mm00479445_m1), nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2,-like 2 (Nfe2l2, assay ID: Mm00477784_m1), and colony-stimulating factor 1 (Csf1, assay ID: Mm00432686_m1). We standardized gene expression levels to mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 (L19, assay ID: Mm02601633_g1) to correct for differences in cellular input and RNA quality and facilitate comparison between samples. Hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt1, assay ID: Mm01545399_m1) and transmembrane protein 40 (Tmem40, assay ID: Mm00460636_m1) also were analyzed as alternate housekeeping genes. The reactions were performed in the 7300 RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems) or SmartCycler real-time PCR system (Cepheid). We analyzed multiple candidate housekeeping genes for normalization, including L19, Hprt1, and Tmem40. Gamma radiation exposure did not modulate levels of the gene L19 at the various time points, but transiently and modestly increased gene expression of Hprt1 (-0.4 cycles, 1.4-fold) and Tmem40 (-1 cycle, 2.3-fold). Following iron irradiation, L19 (as well as Hprt1) showed small increases in cycle number due to treatment (-0.4 cycles, 1.4-fold for L19). As these differences in housekeeping gene expression were small relative to those of cytokine and resorption marker levels, results reported were normalized relative to L19 for both gamma and iron irradiation experiments.Serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b Blood was collected from the heart at the time of euthanasia and serum was separated and stored at −80°C until processed. Enzyme immunoassays were performed for measurement of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP 5b), a biomarker for osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, using a commercial kit (Immunodiagnostic Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Statistics All data are reported as mean±standard deviation. To determine significant differences compared with sham-irradiated controls, a 1-way analysis of variance was used followed by Dunnett's post hoc test. If data were determined to be heteroscedastic (Bartlett's test), a Welch's ANOVA test followed by a post hoc test using the Bonferroni correction were used to determine significant differences from the sham-irradiated controls. Correlation analyses were performed on expression levels of select genes from marrow and bone specimens following gamma irradiation (for the sham and 1, 3, and 7 day endpoints) using the Pearson's product-moment coefficient (r). A P value ≤0.05 was accepted as significant for all analyses. All analyses were performed using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS).Results Cancellous microarchitecture following iron irradiation To determine the extent of bone loss over the short term, mice were irradiated with 56Fe ions (600 MeV) or were sham irradiated (0 Gy controls), then 7 days later bones were harvested and cancellous microarchitecture in the proximal tibia quantified ex vivo using 3D microcomputed tomography. Body weights of irradiated and control animals at the time of tissue harvest did not differ (data not shown). Compared with sham controls, irradiation with 2 Gy reduced BV/TV by 16%, Tb.N by 15%, and showed a trend of increased Tb.Sp by 11% (P=0.053, ANOVA), but did not affect trabecular thickness (Fig. 1). This is consistent with previous reports (Hamilton and others 2006; Alwood and others 2010). We included a basal group in our experiments showing BV/TV of 25.1%±3.6%, which was not different from the age-matched sham control group. A lower dose of iron (5 cGy) failed to elicit changes in bone structural parameters compared with controls and is therefore below the threshold dose for causing bone loss (data not shown). These results validate the model of ionizing radiation-induced cancellous bone loss. FIG. 1.

Data are mean±SD, with * denoting P<0.05 versus sham.Marrow gene expression following iron irradiation To determine if irradiation altered expression of various pro-osteoclastogenic genes, mRNA levels in bone marrow cell lysates were measured using quantitative RT-PCR 3 days after exposure to high-LET iron or sham irradiation. Within 3 days of exposure, iron irradiation increased expression of the Rankl gene by 9.2-fold compared with sham-irradiated controls (Fig. 2). At this time point, transcripts of Opg and Mcp1 were not detected in the marrow (data not shown). Radiation exposure did not alter Tnf expression (Fig. 2). In contrast, a lower dose of iron (5 cGy) did not elicit changes in gene expression (data not shown). These data demonstrated that high-LET particulate irradiation with 2 Gy elicited pro-osteoclastogenic cytokine expression in the bone marrow tissue. FIG. 2. Open in a new tab 2 Gy iron irradiation effects on cytokine gene expression in tibial marrow cells on day 3 (expression level normalized to L19). Radiation exposure increased the gene expression levels of (A) Rankl. Gene expression levels of (B) Tnf were unchanged. Data are mean±SD, with ** denoting P<0.01 versus sham.Gene expression of skeletal tissue following iron irradiation To determine if ionizing radiation altered expression of select genes related to osteoclastogenesis (Rankl, Opg) and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (Ctk, Acp5) in cells within the mineralized compartment of skeletal tissue, RNA was purified from bone after removal of the marrow (leaving predominantly osteocytes). Within 3 days, iron irradiation increased expression of Rankl by 1.9-fold, Acp5 by 1.5-fold, and Ctk by 2.1-fold over sham controls (Fig. 3). Expression levels of Opg did not change. The ratio of Rankl/Opg expression increased 2.8-fold, which provides a relative index that, on balance, cytokine levels favored increased bone resorption. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab 2 Gy iron irradiation effects on gene expression in tibial tissue (sans marrow) by day 3. Comparison of expression levels of (A) Rankl, (B) Opg, (C) Rankl/Opg, (D) Acp5, and (E) Ctk genes after iron irradiation compared with controls (expression level normalized to L19). Data are mean±SD, with ** denoting P<0.01 versus sham.Marrow gene expression following gamma irradiation To determine whether irradiation altered osteoclastogenic and inflammation-related genes, mRNA expression was measured in bone marrow at 4 h or 1, 3, or 7 days after low-LET gamma irradiation and in sham-irradiated controls. Within 4 h, 2 Gy gamma irradiation elevated Rankl in bone marrow by 2.6-fold over the sham; gene expression of Opg was undetectable regardless of treatment (data not shown). Subsequently, the expression of many genes of interest measured in bone marrow (Rankl, Csf1, Nfatc1, Tnf, Mcp1, and Il6) transiently increased within 1 day and subsequently declined toward sham levels (Fig. 4). Expression of Tnf remained elevated through day 3 post-irradiation, while high Rankl expression persisted through day 7 post-irradiation. FIG. 4. Open in a new tab 2 Gy gamma radiation increased expression of pro-osteoclastic and resorption-related genes in pooled tibial and femoral marrow (expression level normalized to L19). Time course (+1, +3, and+7 days post-irradiation) for the following genes compared with sham control: (A) Rankl, (B) Opg, (C) Rankl/Opg, (D) Csf1, (E) Nfatc1, (F) Tnf, (G) Mcp1, (H) Il6, and (I) Nfe2l2. Data are mean±SD, with * denoting P<0.05 and **P<0.01 versus sham and # denoting P=0.061 for the ANOVA.At their peak, expression of pro-osteoclastogenic genes, Rankl and Csf1, and the osteoclast-related transcription factor, Nfatc1, increased by 4.1-fold, 4.2-fold, and 2.0-fold, respectively (Fig. 4A, D, E); the Rankl decoy receptor Opg showed a trend toward increased expression by 11.3-fold (P=0.053 by ANOVA, Fig. 4B); pro-inflammatory genes Tnf, Mcp1, and Il6 increased by 1.7-fold, 11.9-fold, and 1.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 4F, G, H), relative to controls. The ratio of Rankl/Opg increased by 1.8-fold at day 7 after irradiation (Fig. 4C). Additionally, radiation exposure showed a trend toward increased gene expression of Nfe2l2 by 1.6-fold on day 1 compared with controls (P=0.061 for the ANOVA, Fig. 4I). Notably, levels of Nfe2l2 expression were strongly and positively correlated with the osteoclast-related genes Nfatc1 (P<0.05, r=0.89), Csf1 (P<0.05, r=0.63), Tnf (P<0.05, r=0.62), and Rankl (P<0.05, r=0.56). These data show the temporal dependence of changes in cytokine gene expression in the marrow following radiation exposure.Gene expression of skeletal tissue following gamma irradiation Following gamma irradiation, mRNA levels in femoral mineralized tissue (sans marrow) were quantified at 3 and 7 days after irradiation or sham using qRT-PCR normalized to the housekeeping gene, L19, as shown in Fig. 5. Within 3 days, gamma radiation exposure increased the expression of Rankl (2.3-fold), Acp5 (2.2-fold), and Ctk (2.3-fold). Expression of Tnf, Opg, Nfe2l2, and the Rankl/Opg ratio was not changed (Fig. 5). These data suggest that bone-embedded and/or lining cells contribute to osteoclast stimulation and provide evidence for elevated expression of osteoclastogenic (Rankl) and resorption-related (Acp5, Ctk) genes in the skeletal tissue. FIG. 5. Open in a new tab 2 Gy gamma irradiation increased gene expression in femoral and tibial tissue (sans marrow) by day 3. Comparison of expression levels of (A) Rankl, (B) Opg, (C) Rankl/Opg, (D) Acp5, (E) Ctk, (F) Tnf, and (G) Nfe2l2 genes after iron irradiation compared with controls (expression level normalized to L19). Data are mean±SD, with * denoting P<0.05 and ** denoting P<0.01 versus sham.Serum TRACP 5b following gamma irradiation To determine if temporal changes in skeletal gene expression (Figs. 4 and 5) coincide with changes in a protein biomarker of resorption, the circulating levels of osteoclast-specific TRACP 5b were measured at 1, 3, and 7 days after gamma irradiation and in sham controls. Gamma irradiation increased TRACP 5b serum levels by 34% on day 1 and 17% on day 3 compared with sham, with a subsequent gradual decline toward control levels by day 7 (data not shown). Thus, circulating TRACP 5b levels showed a similar time course, although lower in magnitude compared with skeletal gene expression for Rankl and other pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines.Discussion To better understand the mechanisms underlying radiation-induced stimulation of bone resorption, we investigated molecular signals within the latency period between radiation exposure and the manifestation of cancellous tissue loss. In summary, the results show that exposure to either gamma or heavy-ion radiation increased gene expression for the canonical osteoclastogenic factor, Rankl, as well as other pro-osteoclast cytokines (Mcp1, Tnf, Il6); this occurred in both marrow and mineralized tissue. These findings do not distinguish between changes in gene expression levels due to a shift in the cell population expressing osteoclastogenic cytokines, a generally higher level of expression for all the cells, or some combination of both. In fact, after exposure to radiation of sufficient dosage, there are pronounced, if transient, changes in marrow cell viability and increases in marrow macrophages, which are likely to contribute to the generation of new osteoclasts. Therefore, we interpret our results to show that exposure to ionizing radiation increased the tissue concentrations of mRNA levels generally so as to favor osteoclastogenesis. Radiation-induced changes in cytokine expression were temporally related to changes in several indices of bone resorption, including gene expression (Ctk, Acp5, Nfatc1) and a serum biomarker (TRACP 5b levels). In addition, marrow expression of the global antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, showed high correlation with the expression levels of several osteoclast-related genes. These data indicate that the activation of oxidative defenses and of osteoclast formation was temporally associated in response to radiation exposure. Our previous work showed radiation-induced oxidative damage presents later, at 10 days after exposure (Kondo and others 2010). Taken together, our results indicate that Nfe2l2-related antioxidant defense pathways were insufficient to prevent oxidative damage in bone. Changes in gene expression (as early as 4 h or 1 day) preceded bone loss, which manifested in these experiments by day 7 after exposure to 2 Gy iron, although in some cases such as gamma irradiation and lower doses of iron, decrements in cancellous bone volume can be observed as early as 3 days after exposure (Kondo and others 2009; Yumoto and others 2010). Furthermore, a dose threshold was observed, as 5 cGy iron exposure failed to elicit changes in cytokine gene expression in the marrow or cancellous bone structure (data not shown); these findings provide additional indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis that early induction of osteoclastogenic cytokine gene expression by biologically effective doses of radiation leads to cancellous bone loss. Together, the results demonstrate that radiation-induced structural changes were associated with a marrow environment favoring stimulation of osteoclast differentiation and activity by Rankl and other inflammation-related cytokines as follows: Radiation increased gene expression levels for pro-osteoclastogenic signaling molecules (Csf1, Rankl, Tnf), as well as a trend toward increasing antiosteoclastogenic molecules (Opg), in the marrow and mineralized tissue of irradiated mice compared with sham controls. Iron irradiation elevated the ratio of Rankl/Opg in both the marrow and skeletal tissue by day 3, whereas after gamma irradiation, the ratio was elevated in the marrow at 4 h and then again at day 7. A rapid stimulation of Rankl expression by irradiation in the marrow and bone compartment, potentially from hematopoietic lineage cells (Pacifici 2010, 2012; Fumoto and others 2014) or stromal lineage cells (Suda and others 1999; Boyle and others 2003), is consistent with studies that used radiotherapeutic doses and regimens. In young mice, a single dose of 5 or 10 Gy increased Rankl/Opg in whole femora within 3 days (Han and others 2014). Using mice deficient in the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, radiation exposure at high dose (20 Gy) increased RNA expression for Rankl in cultured osteoblasts grown ex vivo, but this was not observed in cells from wild-type mice (Rana and others 2012). These findings suggest an Nfe2l2-mediated increase in expression of antioxidant enzymes may dampen bone resorption responses to radiation. Furthermore, when a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) capable of differentiating into osteoclast-like cells after RANKL treatment is exposed to ionizing radiation (2 Gy gamma), gene expression levels rise for β3 integrin, an adhesion receptor that is important for osteoclast differentiation, as well as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (Rank), the receptor for Rankl on osteoclasts (Yang and others 2012). In other in vitro work, irradiation with 2 or 4 Gy increases Rankl in differentiated, MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells (Yang and others 2013). Our work is the first to demonstrate the time course of radiation-induced changes in expression of various osteoclastogenic cytokines following 2 Gy exposure (both low- and high-LET) with subsequent bone loss and within the upper range of space-relevant doses and types of radiation. Ionizing radiation also increased tissue expression of pro-inflammatory, osteoclastogenic ligands, Mcp1, Tnf, and Il6, which are all factors generally thought to stimulate osteoclast activity (Takayanagi 2007) in the presence of RANKL (Kostenuik and Shalhoub 2001; Yu and others 2004; Kim and others 2005, 2006; Sul and others 2012; Liu and others 2013). In some reports, TNF may act independently of RANKL to stimulate osteoclastogenesis (Kobayashi and others 2000). Our results are consistent with other work showing that in vivo exposure to ionizing radiation leads to rapid, complex, and interrelated sequence of signals constituting an immune-related cytokine response in bone marrow (Schaue and McBride 2010; Willey and others 2011; Schaue and others 2012; Buchwald and Aurora 2013). At a very high dose (10 Gy), which is sufficient to ablate the bone marrow of hematopoietic cells, radiation causes bone loss related to elevated fractalkine expression by vascular endothelial cells, inflammatory cytokines Tnf, interleukin 1 beta, and interferon gamma, and recruitment of preosteoclasts (CD11b) (Han and others 2014). Additionally, the time course of cytokine and resorption-related gene expression shown in this study coincides with that of marrow cell death and repopulation (Otsuka and others 2008; Kondo and others 2010), suggesting a possible relationship between an expanded population of marrow macrophages clearing apoptotic cells and debris after irradiation, the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclasts, and increased resorption activity. Taken together, these data lead us to propose a 2-stage process for radiation-induced osteoclastogenesis: first, radiation-induced gene expression of osteoclastogenic cytokines leads to enrichment of the marrow with osteoclast precursors (monocyte–macrophage, myeloid lineage cells) and drives differentiation into osteoclasts, and, second, that inflammation-related cytokines co-stimulate differentiating and mature osteoclasts. As a functional measure of active osteoclasts, we provide evidence that 2 Gy gamma irradiation elevated circulating levels of osteoclast-specific TRACP 5b protein, indicative of increased bone resorption. In this work, the radiation-induced elevation in serum TRACP 5b returned to control levels by day 7 following exposure, These results are consistent with those reported by Willey and others (2010, 2011) showing that X-irradiation (2 Gy) of female mice increases circulating TRACP 5b levels 1, 3, and 7 days after irradiation. Radiation-induced decrements in cancellous tissue observed in these experiments were consistent with our previous results. Acute cancellous bone loss temporally manifests on day 3 at a dose as low as 10 cGy iron (Yumoto and others 2010). Persistent structural decrements (lasting >1 week) manifest at doses above ∼50 cGy iron (Yumoto and others 2010) and 1 Gy gamma exposure (Hamilton and others 2006; Kondo and others 2010) before being overtaken, in the case of gamma irradiation, by age-related bone loss (Alwood and others 2012). Taken together, given the observed time course of skeletal gene expression and serum resorption markers, we conclude that the structural deficits arose from a spike in osteoclastogenic cytokine expression that follows exposure to ionizing radiation (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010). Limitations of this work include the dose rate used to model space radiation. It is an open question whether lower dose rate exposures that constitute true space radiation stimulate osteoclasts and bone loss to the same extent as the exposures used here. In addition, other signaling molecules, including various other cytokines not studied here, are likely also to play a role in regulating bone resorption after challenge with ionizing radiation, while changes in osteoblast lineage cells are likely to be important for maintaining structural integrity at later times post-irradiation. In conclusion, an improved understanding of the molecular response to radiation exposure may aid the development of biological treatments to mitigate potentially deleterious skeletal consequences during space flight.Acknowledgments This research was supported by the National Space Biomedical Research Institute grant No. MA02501 under NASA cooperative agreement NCC 9-58 (R.K.G., J.S.A.), a DOE-NASA Interagency Award No. DE-SC0001507, supported by the Office of Science (Biological and Environmental Research), U.S. Department of Energy (R.K.G.), and 2 NASA Postdoctoral Program fellowships from NASA's Space Biology Program (J.S.A., A.K).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Even with recent scientific advancements, challenges posed by limited resources and capabilities at the time of sample dissection continue to limit the collection of high quality tissues from experiments that can be conducted only infrequently and at high cost, such as in space. The resources and time it takes to harvest tissues post-euthanasia, and the methods and duration of long duration storage, potentially have negative impacts on sample quantity and quality, thereby limiting the scientific outcome that can be achieved.Objectives The goals of this study were to optimize methods for both sample recovery and science return from rodent experiments, with possible relevance to both ground based and spaceflight studies. The first objective was to determine the impacts of tissue harvest time post-euthanasia, preservation methods, and storage duration, focusing on RNA quality and enzyme activities in liver and spleen as indices of sample quality. The second objective was to develop methods that will maximize science return by dissecting multiple tissues after long duration storage in situ at -80°C.Methods Tissues of C57Bl/6J mice were dissected and preserved at various time points post-euthanasia and stored at -80°C for up to 11 months. In some experiments, tissues were recovered from frozen carcasses which had been stored at -80°C up to 7 months. RNA quantity and quality was assessed by measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Additionally, the quality of tissues was assessed by measuring activities of hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH).Results Fresh tissues were collected up to one hour post-euthanasia, and stored up to 11 months at -80°C, with minimal adverse effects on the RNA quality of either livers or RNAlater-preserved spleens. Liver enzyme activities were similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effect observed at any time point. Tissues dissected from frozen carcasses that had been stored for up to 7 months at -80°C had variable results, depending on the specific tissue analyzed. RNA quality of liver, heart, and kidneys were minimally affected after 6–7 months of storage at -80°C, whereas RNA degradation was evident in tissues such as small intestine, bone, and bone marrow when they were collected from the carcasses frozen for 2.5 months.Conclusion These results demonstrate that 1) the protocols developed for spaceflight experiments with on-orbit dissections support the retrieval of high quality samples for RNA expression and some protein analyses, despite delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage, and 2) many additional tissues for gene expression analysis can be obtained by dissection even following prolonged storage of the tissue in situ at -80°C. These findings have relevance both to high value, ground-based experiments when sample collection capability is severely constrained, and to spaceflight experiments that entail on-orbit sample recovery by astronauts.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Challenges continue to exist in regards to acquiring high quality samples from animal tissues despite recent technical advances. From the time spent collecting the samples to the use of stabilizing or preserving agents, and ultimately to the storage conditions and duration prior to actual analysis, each step is critical and requires attention. Timing plays a key role in obtaining high quality samples. Ideally, samples are harvested immediately post-euthanasia by trained and experienced staff, and the time between death and sample stabilization is minimized to limit sample degradation. If the samples are not analyzed at the time of euthanasia, then additional factors that may affect sample quality are of concern, including freezing rate and duration of storage. Understanding these challenges faced in the laboratory aids the researcher to optimize protocols to maximize sample quality and accomplish science objectives; translating those practices for use in the space environment, however, raises new challenges. Several factors potentially affect sample quality, and ultimately, the downstream experimental results. The procedure to obtain high quality RNA varies between different laboratories [1]. The most reliable source for obtaining high quality RNA is by purification from freshly dissected tissues [2–7]. A factor to be taken into consideration when tissues are not processed immediately at the time of harvesting is the time samples are exposed to periods of warm ischemia, which may occur during and after surgery, and between sample thawing and processing. In some instances, warm ischemia-induced degradation alters gene expression profiles and RNA quality in certain tissues, although the process appears to have selective effects on individual genes [4, 8, 9]. RNA is subject to degradation by ubiquitous RNAses, and high quality RNA is needed for analysis of gene expression, next-generation sequencing, gene profiling and other “Omics” analyses in the study of molecular mechanisms. The addition of an RNA stabilization solution to tissues, either by immersion or perfusion, has become standard practice for RNA stabilization [7, 10, 11]. Studies where select tissues are frozen immediately upon harvesting, with or without stabilization buffer, show no significant detriment to the quality of the RNA [6, 12–16]. Frozen tissues that are allowed to thaw at room temperature up to 16 hours show significant degradation in samples without a stabilization buffer such as RNAlater, versus those stored in RNAlater [14]. Recent work published by Gupta et al describe retention of RNA quality in rodent male and female reproductive organs when samples are placed into RNAlater up to 40 minutes after euthanasia and in RNAlater treated samples stored at -80°C for 10 months [17]. Other studies reveal severe degradation of RNA in frozen tissues when allowed to thaw for up to 30 minutes prior to analysis, suggesting the necessity for immediate processing of certain tissues [18, 19]. In the studies reported here, we investigated various time points and storage conditions for retrieving tissues from mice, and then determined the impact that these conditions had on sample quality. By measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) and enzyme activities in tissues under various recovery scenarios, we have characterized and established an acceptable timeline for rodent tissue isolation, preservation, and storage to optimize science return from both ground based and on-orbit flight sample collection.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animals Adult female C57Bl/6J mice from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) were used in all the experiments. All animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol (Virbac, Fort Worth, TX) followed by cervical dislocation. All efforts were made to minimize suffering. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the NASA Ames Research Center approved the animal care and experimental procedures. Tissue collection Fresh tissue samples: To provide positive control tissues representing preservation by standard laboratory conditions, spleens and livers were harvested immediately post-euthanasia then were either promptly (within 5 min) frozen in liquid nitrogen (liver) or preserved in RNAlater (spleen). To simulate the anticipated dissection timing by astronauts on-orbit, spleens were removed at 6 or 22 minutes after euthanasia, and livers were removed at 9 or 25 minutes post-euthanasia (Fig 1), then placed in cryovials (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Spleens were preserved in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and livers were frozen by embedding the cryovials in pelleted dry ice. Samples were either stored at -80°C for 3.5 mo (spleen) and 4.5 mo (liver), or for 11 mo prior to analysis. Fig 1. Experimental design schematic. Open in a new tab Tissues were harvested at various times from C57Bl/6J mice post-euthanasia (fresh spleen and liver) or from frozen whole or partially dissected carcasses. Samples and carcasses were stored at -80°C for various durations as long as 11 months prior to tissue harvest (carcasses) and analysis of liver enzyme activities or RNA quality (RIN), as described in Methods.Time-delay between euthanasia and stabilization: To bracket the possible time frames that the astronaut crew may need to dissect then preserve the samples, spleens were harvested at 1, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 minutes post-euthanasia and preserved in RNAlater. Livers were harvested from the same mice at 2, 25, 45, 65, 85, and 105 minutes post-euthanasia and frozen in dry ice. Samples were stored at -80°C for 1 month prior to analysis. Whole Carcass (WC): Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol followed by cervical dislocation. The carcasses were then wrapped in two layers of foil and placed in Ziploc bags. The carcasses were frozen using an aluminum block that was pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen, to simulate the freezing kit used on-orbit, and transferred to a -80°C freezer for storage (up to 10 months). Various tissues (spleen, liver, heart, kidney, lung, brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus, small intestine, large intestine, femur, tibia, hindlimb muscle, and bone marrow) were collected from 2.5, 4 and 6–7 month frozen WC after thawing at room temperature for 20–30 minutes, and then preserved in RNAlater. Positive control WC were immersed in liquid nitrogen immediately after euthanasia and were stored in a 80°C freezer for 4 and 6–7 months. Partially Dissected Carcass (PC): Spleens and livers were removed following euthanasia, and utilized for a different study. The dissected carcasses then were wrapped with two layers of aluminum foil, and sealed in a Ziploc bag before freezing on dry ice. The time from euthanasia to the carcass freezing in dry ice was about 2 hours. PC were stored at -80°C for 2.5 months prior to harvesting the tissues (brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus, small intestine, hindlimb muscle, and bone marrow). PC were removed from the -80°C freezer, and placed at room temperature with the aluminum foils open for partial thawing to the extent that dissection commenced, which was up to 35 minutes after removal from -80°C. Tissues were preserved in RNAlater. RNA isolation and analysis RNA was extracted from homogenized tissues using TRIzol reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA concentration and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was measured by calculating the RNA integrity number (RIN) using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), where a RIN of 10 is considered intact and 0 totally degraded RNA [20, 21]. The analysis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Liver enzyme assays The activities of three hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH) were measured to assess sample quality after various collection conditions. Catalase activity was measured using the colorimetric assay for Catalase (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and normalized to total protein levels (Thermo Scientific™ Pierce™ Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Kit, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Catalase protein levels were measured using the Catalase Human ELISA Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and specific activity of the enzyme calculated (U/μg catalase protein). Glutathione reductase activity levels were determined using the Glutathione Reductase (GR) Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and GAPDH activity levels were determined using the colorimetric GAPDH assay kit (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA). The activity levels were also normalized by the total protein concentrations using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit. Positive controls were obtained according to standard laboratory protocols where dissections were followed by immersion of the samples in liquid nitrogen. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using either parametric or non-parametric tests. The data sets were first assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, where a p-value <0.05 indicated non-normally distributed data. If the data were normally distributed, one way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test was performed. For non-normally distributed data, non-parametric tests were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn post-hoc test (Joint Ranks, compared to Control). In non-parametric boxplots, medians within the interquartile (boxes) and full range (whiskers) are displayed. p<0.05 was considered significant throughout.",
    "results": "Results RNA quality in tissues collected at various time points post-euthanasia To determine if harvest times post-euthanasia alters RNA quality, freshly-dissected spleens and livers were isolated at various time points, preserved as shown in Fig 1 and Table 1, and stored at -80°C for less than 5 months prior to RNA purification. RNA purified from spleens and livers that were dissected up to 25 minutes post-euthanasia and stored at -80°C for 3.5 and 4.5 months, respectively, showed no significant detrimental effect on the quality of the RNA (RIN > 8), when compared to the control samples (Fig 2). Although spleen samples collected up to 100 minutes post-euthanasia, and preserved in RNA later, also showed that RNA quality was minimally affected (RIN > 8) (Fig 3a), liver samples showed a significant decline in RNA quality after collection times of 45 minutes (RIN < 8 at 65 minutes, RIN < 7 at 85 minutes and RIN < 6.8 at 105 minutes) (Fig 3b). Together, these data demonstrated that spleens can be collected up to 100 minutes after euthanasia to yield high quality RNA (RIN > 8) when preserved in RNAlater (stored at -80°C). In contrast, a significant decline in liver RIN values was observed 65 minutes after euthanasia, when compared to control samples. Table 1.

Effects of preservation times post-euthanasia on RNA quality in spleen and liver. Open in a new tab Spleens and livers were collected from up to 3 minutes (Positive Control), 9 minutes (Set 1), and 25 minutes (Set 2) post-euthanasia. Set 1 and 2 time points were selected to simulate anticipated dissection timing in microgravity. Spleens were preserved in RNAlater, and livers were frozen on dry ice. All samples were stored at -80°C, and analyzed after 3.5 months for spleen and 4.5 months for liver. RNA quality was measured by calculating the Bioanalyzer-based RNA integrity number (RIN) using the Bioanalyzer 2100. Samples harvested up to 25 minutes post-euthanasia, and stored for less than 5 months at -80°C, yielded RIN values greater than 8. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Values shown are medians within interquartile (boxes) and full range (whiskers). Spleens: n = 4, 9, and 8 for Control, Set 1 and 2, respectively. Livers: n = 3, 10, and 10 for Control, Set 1 and 2, respectively.Fig 3. Effects of delayed dissections on RNA quality in spleens and livers. Open in a new tab Spleens were collected at 1 (Positive Control), 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 minutes post-euthanasia, and were preserved in RNAlater. RNAlater-preserved spleen samples yielded high RIN values (RIN > 7.5) for all time points (A). Liver tissues from the same mice in (A) were collected at 2 (Positive Control), 25, 45, 65, 85, and 105 minutes post-euthanasia, and were frozen on dry ice. RNA quality in samples collected up to 45 minutes post-euthanasia were minimally affected, resulting in RIN values > 8. RIN value decreased by 24% in samples collected at 105 minutes post-euthanasia, compared to controls (B). All samples were stored at -80°C for 1 month prior to analysis. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the Dunn post-hoc test (Joint Ranks, compared to Control). Values shown are medians within interquartile (boxes) and full range (whiskers). (n = 4 for each time point). * p<0.05, ** p<0.01Activity levels of three liver enzymes also were measured from the time-delayed dissections. Glutathione reductase (Fig 4a) and GAPDH (Fig 4b) levels were similar to those of the positive controls. Catalase activities were only moderately lower in the samples collected at 105 minutes after dissection compared to the control samples (Fig 4c). Overall, the activities of these enzymes in harvested liver tissues were not significantly affected by collection time or storage at -80°C for 1 month. Fig 4. Effects of time-delayed dissections on hepatic enzyme levels. Open in a new tab Activities of three hepatic enzymes, glutathione reductase, GAPDH and catalase, were measured from samples collected at various times post-dissection. Glutathione reductase (A) and GAPDH (B) activity was similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effects observed at any time point. Catalase activities were similar to those of the positive controls; however, samples collected at 105 minutes post-euthanasia displayed significantly lower levels when compared to tissue collected at 65 minutes (C). Activity levels of glutathione reductase and GAPDH were normalized by the total protein concentrations. Catalase activity levels were normalized by catalase protein. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test. Values are means ± SD (n = 4). ** p<0.01 Effect of storage duration at -80°C on tissue quality To assess the influence of storage duration on sample quality, spleens and livers were collected per standard laboratory procedures (up to 5 minutes post-euthanasia), and then stored at -80°C for 1, 3.5, 4.5, and 11 months prior to analysis. At all time points investigated, no significant degradation was found in the RNA quality of any of the tissue samples (RIN > 8) (Fig 5). These data demonstrate that quality of the tissues can be maintained for up to 11 months when the tissues are stored at -80°C. Fig 5. Effects of long duration storage at -80°C on RNA quality in spleen and liver. Open in a new tab Spleens and livers were collected up to 5 minutes post-euthanasia. Spleens were preserved in RNAlater, and livers were frozen on dry ice. Samples were stored at -80°C for 1, 3.5, and 11 months for spleen, and 1, 4.5, and 11 months for liver. Samples stored up to 11 months at -80°C resulted in RIN values greater than 8. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Values shown are medians within interquartile (boxes) and full range (whiskers) (n = 4 for all months except for n = 3 for Liver 12 months). * p<0.05 Integrity of RNA harvested from whole frozen carcasses To assess RNA quality from whole frozen carcasses (WC), we analyzed the spleen, liver, heart, kidney, and lung dissected from WC that were stored at -80°C for 2.5, 4, and 6–7 months. Results from spleens showed that increased duration at -80°C from 2.5 to 6–7 months caused a 25% decline in RIN values. Long durations of storage (4-7months) had minimal effects on RNA quality of liver, heart, kidney, and lung although RIN values were 6% lower when comparing WC liver at 6–7 months (Fig 6) to fresh liver which was dissected first then frozen for 11 months at -80°C prior to analysis (Fig 5). Fig 6. Integrity of RNA harvested from whole frozen carcasses. Open in a new tab Whole frozen carcasses (WC) were frozen using an aluminum block that was pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen to simulate the freezing kit used on-orbit (2.5, 4 and 6–7 month WC) prior to being placed into a -80°C freezer. Spleen, liver, heart, kidney, and lung were collected within 30 minutes post thawing of the WC, and preserved in RNAlater prior to analysis. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test. Values are means ± SD (n = 9 for 2.5 month, except n = 8 for lung; n = 4, 5, 6, 3, 4 for 4 month spleen, liver, heart, kidney and lung, respectively; n = 3 for 6–7 month). * p<0.05; ** p<0.01Using a separate group of WC we dissected numerous additional tissues and determined the RNA quality. High quality RNA was recovered from various tissues (brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus and hindlimb muscle); RIN values were greater than 7.5 in all tissues (Fig 7a). Small intestine and bone marrow, however, showed severe degradation (RIN values less than 3,) despite rapid preservation in RNAlater at the time of dissection. Additionally, femur, large intestine, and tibia yielded RNA with RIN values less than 5 (Fig 7a). These findings suggest that after long term storage in -80C high quality RNA can be recovered from select tissues of whole carcasses. Fig 7. The effects on RNA quality in various tissues recovered from whole and partially dissected carcasses stored at -80°C for 2.5 months. Open in a new tab Tissue samples were removed from the frozen carcasses for RIN analysis. Tissues were preserved in RNAlater prior to analysis. Brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus, and hindlimb muscles resulted in high RIN values in both WC (A) and PC (B). RNA quality in WC and PC small intestine and bone marrow samples were severely degraded, resulting in RIN values < 3 (A and B). Values are means ± SD (n = 8 for Fig 7A, except n = 7 adrenal gland, n = 5 femur and bone marrow, and n = 4 tibia; n = 4 for Fig 7B, except n = 3 adrenal gland). Integrity of RNA harvested from partially dissected carcasses To determine if the carcasses that were stored after select tissue dissection also can yield high quality samples of other tissue types after long-term storage, tissues were harvested from partially dissected carcasses stored at -80°C for 2.5 months. Similar to the results found as in WC; PC tissue samples resulted in high RNA quality recovered from brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus and hindlimb muscles. Small intestine and bone marrow samples showed severe degradation similar to that seen in WC (Fig 7b).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Our results demonstrated that high quality RNA (RIN> 7) could be isolated from most of the tissues, even from tissues stored for a prolonged period of time (results summarized in Table 1). However, RNA samples isolated from select tissues dissected from frozen carcasses (e.g. spleen, small intestine, bone marrow and mineralized tissues) showed degradation even with short duration storage, probably due to high endogenous RNase activity. Tissues preserved in RNAlater showed significant improvement in RNA quality compared to tissues immersed in liquid nitrogen [22]. In the present study, we observed that freshly harvested spleens preserved in RNAlater showed a higher RIN (RIN >8) compared to spleens dissected from frozen carcasses (RIN = ~5.5). In the absence of RNAlater, liver samples yielded relatively high quality RNA (RIN >6.5). Sample quality collected under various conditions varied depending on tissue type and endpoint measured. Spleens collected up to 100 minutes after euthanasia yielded high quality RNA since they were preserved in RNAlater. Liver tissues collected up to 65 minutes after euthanasia, also yielded high quality samples. However, liver samples showed a significant decline in RNA quality (RIN <8) after 65 minutes post-euthanasia. These data demonstrate that tissues collected with appropriate timing that is typical for laboratory dissections (i.e., up to 30 minutes between euthanasia and tissue collection) can yield samples of acceptable quality to achieve exceptional science return, as expected [23]. These findings are consistent with those of others who showed that RNA samples from tonsils can be stable for several hours, and even after overnight storage at room temperature, RNA did not significantly degrade [6]. However, long-term storage (e.g. 16 hours) at room temperature could result in significant changes in expression levels of some genes. In addition to the time delay in tissue collection and storage, the repetitive freezing and thawing of the snap-frozen tissues could affect RNA integrity. However, RNA degradation in frozen liver tissue did not occur in seconds or over few minutes, but over 30 minutes of thawing at room temperature [18]. Thus, if tissues accidentally are thawed for a brief period, those tissues do not necessarily have to be discarded from gene expression analyses. Schoor et al. report that partially degraded RNA may still be usable even though suboptimal quality [24]. Furthermore, it was reported that RNA with low RIN still allows for reliable monitoring of mRNA expression by qPCR if small amplicon sizes are targeted, although large amplicons failed to generate measurable expression values [25]. These findings, along with our own, allow investigators in the future to use carcass that have been preserved by freezing, to address questions that may arise at a later time. Testing methods in ground based experiments by applying anticipated on-orbit scenarios, reduces the risk of recovering samples of inadequate quality from high cost spaceflight experiments. Spleens and livers collected at various time points post-euthanasia to simulate challenging conditions for dissections in microgravity yielded samples with high RIN values, thus anticipating return of samples with high quality from space even if preservation post-euthanasia is delayed up to 1 hour. When plant samples were placed into a -20°C freezer, severe RNA degradation resulted; however, when the plant samples were preserved in RNAlater and stored at either 4°C or -20°C, the integrity of RNA was maintained. Furthermore, wheat samples preserved in RNAlater from an experiment performed on the ISS, yielded RNA quality comparable to fresh samples, even after undergoing fluctuations of storage temperatures [26]. More recently, RNAlater preserved plant samples were shown to yield sufficient amounts of protein to allow broad-scale proteomics analyses [27]. We showed that multiple tissues collected from frozen carcasses yielded high quality RNA, which could be applied to RNAseq, gene profiling and qPCR. High quality sample recovery for RNA and at least some enzymes is possible from most tissues, despite either delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage. Based on our RIN results, it is our recommendation that the collection of tissue samples occur within 45 minutes for studies requiring high quality RNA and within 85 minutes for usual RNA studies. Should sample retrieval occur from frozen carcasses, our studies show that many, but not all tissues yield high RNA quality up to 7 months storage time at -80°C.",

Copyright notice ID: 5132293 PMID: 27907194 Abstract Background Even with recent scientific advancements, challenges posed by limited resources and capabilities at the time of sample dissection continue to limit the collection of high quality tissues from experiments that can be conducted only infrequently and at high cost, such as in space. The resources and time it takes to harvest tissues post-euthanasia, and the methods and duration of long duration storage, potentially have negative impacts on sample quantity and quality, thereby limiting the scientific outcome that can be achieved.Objectives The goals of this study were to optimize methods for both sample recovery and science return from rodent experiments, with possible relevance to both ground based and spaceflight studies. The first objective was to determine the impacts of tissue harvest time post-euthanasia, preservation methods, and storage duration, focusing on RNA quality and enzyme activities in liver and spleen as indices of sample quality. The second objective was to develop methods that will maximize science return by dissecting multiple tissues after long duration storage in situ at -80°C.Methods Tissues of C57Bl/6J mice were dissected and preserved at various time points post-euthanasia and stored at -80°C for up to 11 months. In some experiments, tissues were recovered from frozen carcasses which had been stored at -80°C up to 7 months. RNA quantity and quality was assessed by measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Additionally, the quality of tissues was assessed by measuring activities of hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH).Results Fresh tissues were collected up to one hour post-euthanasia, and stored up to 11 months at -80°C, with minimal adverse effects on the RNA quality of either livers or RNAlater-preserved spleens. Liver enzyme activities were similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effect observed at any time point. Tissues dissected from frozen carcasses that had been stored for up to 7 months at -80°C had variable results, depending on the specific tissue analyzed. RNA quality of liver, heart, and kidneys were minimally affected after 6–7 months of storage at -80°C, whereas RNA degradation was evident in tissues such as small intestine, bone, and bone marrow when they were collected from the carcasses frozen for 2.5 months.Conclusion These results demonstrate that 1) the protocols developed for spaceflight experiments with on-orbit dissections support the retrieval of high quality samples for RNA expression and some protein analyses, despite delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage, and 2) many additional tissues for gene expression analysis can be obtained by dissection even following prolonged storage of the tissue in situ at -80°C. These findings have relevance both to high value, ground-based experiments when sample collection capability is severely constrained, and to spaceflight experiments that entail on-orbit sample recovery by astronauts.Introduction Challenges continue to exist in regards to acquiring high quality samples from animal tissues despite recent technical advances. From the time spent collecting the samples to the use of stabilizing or preserving agents, and ultimately to the storage conditions and duration prior to actual analysis, each step is critical and requires attention. Timing plays a key role in obtaining high quality samples. Ideally, samples are harvested immediately post-euthanasia by trained and experienced staff, and the time between death and sample stabilization is minimized to limit sample degradation. If the samples are not analyzed at the time of euthanasia, then additional factors that may affect sample quality are of concern, including freezing rate and duration of storage. Understanding these challenges faced in the laboratory aids the researcher to optimize protocols to maximize sample quality and accomplish science objectives; translating those practices for use in the space environment, however, raises new challenges. Several factors potentially affect sample quality, and ultimately, the downstream experimental results. The procedure to obtain high quality RNA varies between different laboratories [1]. The most reliable source for obtaining high quality RNA is by purification from freshly dissected tissues [2–7]. A factor to be taken into consideration when tissues are not processed immediately at the time of harvesting is the time samples are exposed to periods of warm ischemia, which may occur during and after surgery, and between sample thawing and processing. In some instances, warm ischemia-induced degradation alters gene expression profiles and RNA quality in certain tissues, although the process appears to have selective effects on individual genes [4, 8, 9]. RNA is subject to degradation by ubiquitous RNAses, and high quality RNA is needed for analysis of gene expression, next-generation sequencing, gene profiling and other “Omics” analyses in the study of molecular mechanisms. The addition of an RNA stabilization solution to tissues, either by immersion or perfusion, has become standard practice for RNA stabilization [7, 10, 11]. Studies where select tissues are frozen immediately upon harvesting, with or without stabilization buffer, show no significant detriment to the quality of the RNA [6, 12–16]. Frozen tissues that are allowed to thaw at room temperature up to 16 hours show significant degradation in samples without a stabilization buffer such as RNAlater, versus those stored in RNAlater [14]. Recent work published by Gupta et al describe retention of RNA quality in rodent male and female reproductive organs when samples are placed into RNAlater up to 40 minutes after euthanasia and in RNAlater treated samples stored at -80°C for 10 months [17]. Other studies reveal severe degradation of RNA in frozen tissues when allowed to thaw for up to 30 minutes prior to analysis, suggesting the necessity for immediate processing of certain tissues [18, 19]. In the studies reported here, we investigated various time points and storage conditions for retrieving tissues from mice, and then determined the impact that these conditions had on sample quality. By measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) and enzyme activities in tissues under various recovery scenarios, we have characterized and established an acceptable timeline for rodent tissue isolation, preservation, and storage to optimize science return from both ground based and on-orbit flight sample collection.Materials and Methods Animals Adult female C57Bl/6J mice from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) were used in all the experiments. All animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol (Virbac, Fort Worth, TX) followed by cervical dislocation. All efforts were made to minimize suffering. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the NASA Ames Research Center approved the animal care and experimental procedures.Tissue collection Fresh tissue samples: To provide positive control tissues representing preservation by standard laboratory conditions, spleens and livers were harvested immediately post-euthanasia then were either promptly (within 5 min) frozen in liquid nitrogen (liver) or preserved in RNAlater (spleen). To simulate the anticipated dissection timing by astronauts on-orbit, spleens were removed at 6 or 22 minutes after euthanasia, and livers were removed at 9 or 25 minutes post-euthanasia (Fig 1), then placed in cryovials (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Spleens were preserved in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and livers were frozen by embedding the cryovials in pelleted dry ice. Samples were either stored at -80°C for 3.5 mo (spleen) and 4.5 mo (liver), or for 11 mo prior to analysis. Fig 1. Experimental design schematic. Open in a new tab Tissues were harvested at various times from C57Bl/6J mice post-euthanasia (fresh spleen and liver) or from frozen whole or partially dissected carcasses. Samples and carcasses were stored at -80°C for various durations as long as 11 months prior to tissue harvest (carcasses) and analysis of liver enzyme activities or RNA quality (RIN), as described in Methods.Time-delay between euthanasia and stabilization: To bracket the possible time frames that the astronaut crew may need to dissect then preserve the samples, spleens were harvested at 1, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 minutes post-euthanasia and preserved in RNAlater. Livers were harvested from the same mice at 2, 25, 45, 65, 85, and 105 minutes post-euthanasia and frozen in dry ice. Samples were stored at -80°C for 1 month prior to analysis. Whole Carcass (WC): Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol followed by cervical dislocation. The carcasses were then wrapped in two layers of foil and placed in Ziploc bags. The carcasses were frozen using an aluminum block that was pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen, to simulate the freezing kit used on-orbit, and transferred to a -80°C freezer for storage (up to 10 months). Various tissues (spleen, liver, heart, kidney, lung, brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus, small intestine, large intestine, femur, tibia, hindlimb muscle, and bone marrow) were collected from 2.5, 4 and 6–7 month frozen WC after thawing at room temperature for 20–30 minutes, and then preserved in RNAlater. Positive control WC were immersed in liquid nitrogen immediately after euthanasia and were stored in a 80°C freezer for 4 and 6–7 months. Partially Dissected Carcass (PC): Spleens and livers were removed following euthanasia, and utilized for a different study. The dissected carcasses then were wrapped with two layers of aluminum foil, and sealed in a Ziploc bag before freezing on dry ice. The time from euthanasia to the carcass freezing in dry ice was about 2 hours. PC were stored at -80°C for 2.5 months prior to harvesting the tissues (brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus, small intestine, hindlimb muscle, and bone marrow). PC were removed from the -80°C freezer, and placed at room temperature with the aluminum foils open for partial thawing to the extent that dissection commenced, which was up to 35 minutes after removal from -80°C. Tissues were preserved in RNAlater.RNA isolation and analysis RNA was extracted from homogenized tissues using TRIzol reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA concentration and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was measured by calculating the RNA integrity number (RIN) using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), where a RIN of 10 is considered intact and 0 totally degraded RNA [20, 21]. The analysis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Liver enzyme assays The activities of three hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH) were measured to assess sample quality after various collection conditions. Catalase activity was measured using the colorimetric assay for Catalase (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and normalized to total protein levels (Thermo Scientific™ Pierce™ Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Kit, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Catalase protein levels were measured using the Catalase Human ELISA Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and specific activity of the enzyme calculated (U/μg catalase protein). Glutathione reductase activity levels were determined using the Glutathione Reductase (GR) Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and GAPDH activity levels were determined using the colorimetric GAPDH assay kit (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA). The activity levels were also normalized by the total protein concentrations using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit. Positive controls were obtained according to standard laboratory protocols where dissections were followed by immersion of the samples in liquid nitrogen.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using either parametric or non-parametric tests. The data sets were first assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, where a p-value <0.05 indicated non-normally distributed data. If the data were normally distributed, one way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test was performed. For non-normally distributed data, non-parametric tests were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn post-hoc test (Joint Ranks, compared to Control). In non-parametric boxplots, medians within the interquartile (boxes) and full range (whiskers) are displayed. p<0.05 was considered significant throughout.Results RNA quality in tissues collected at various time points post-euthanasia To determine if harvest times post-euthanasia alters RNA quality, freshly-dissected spleens and livers were isolated at various time points, preserved as shown in Fig 1 and Table 1, and stored at -80°C for less than 5 months prior to RNA purification. RNA purified from spleens and livers that were dissected up to 25 minutes post-euthanasia and stored at -80°C for 3.5 and 4.5 months, respectively, showed no significant detrimental effect on the quality of the RNA (RIN > 8), when compared to the control samples (Fig 2). Although spleen samples collected up to 100 minutes post-euthanasia, and preserved in RNA later, also showed that RNA quality was minimally affected (RIN > 8) (Fig 3a), liver samples showed a significant decline in RNA quality after collection times of 45 minutes (RIN < 8 at 65 minutes, RIN < 7 at 85 minutes and RIN < 6.8 at 105 minutes) (Fig 3b). Together, these data demonstrated that spleens can be collected up to 100 minutes after euthanasia to yield high quality RNA (RIN > 8) when preserved in RNAlater (stored at -80°C). In contrast, a significant decline in liver RIN values was observed 65 minutes after euthanasia, when compared to control samples. Table 1.

Effects of preservation times post-euthanasia on RNA quality in spleen and liver. Open in a new tab Spleens and livers were collected from up to 3 minutes (Positive Control), 9 minutes (Set 1), and 25 minutes (Set 2) post-euthanasia. Set 1 and 2 time points were selected to simulate anticipated dissection timing in microgravity. Spleens were preserved in RNAlater, and livers were frozen on dry ice. All samples were stored at -80°C, and analyzed after 3.5 months for spleen and 4.5 months for liver. RNA quality was measured by calculating the Bioanalyzer-based RNA integrity number (RIN) using the Bioanalyzer 2100. Samples harvested up to 25 minutes post-euthanasia, and stored for less than 5 months at -80°C, yielded RIN values greater than 8. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Values shown are medians within interquartile (boxes) and full range (whiskers). Spleens: n = 4, 9, and 8 for Control, Set 1 and 2, respectively. Livers: n = 3, 10, and 10 for Control, Set 1 and 2, respectively.Fig 3. Effects of delayed dissections on RNA quality in spleens and livers. Open in a new tab Spleens were collected at 1 (Positive Control), 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 minutes post-euthanasia, and were preserved in RNAlater. RNAlater-preserved spleen samples yielded high RIN values (RIN > 7.5) for all time points (A). Liver tissues from the same mice in (A) were collected at 2 (Positive Control), 25, 45, 65, 85, and 105 minutes post-euthanasia, and were frozen on dry ice. RNA quality in samples collected up to 45 minutes post-euthanasia were minimally affected, resulting in RIN values > 8. RIN value decreased by 24% in samples collected at 105 minutes post-euthanasia, compared to controls (B). All samples were stored at -80°C for 1 month prior to analysis. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the Dunn post-hoc test (Joint Ranks, compared to Control). Values shown are medians within interquartile (boxes) and full range (whiskers). (n = 4 for each time point). * p<0.05, ** p<0.01Activity levels of three liver enzymes also were measured from the time-delayed dissections. Glutathione reductase (Fig 4a) and GAPDH (Fig 4b) levels were similar to those of the positive controls. Catalase activities were only moderately lower in the samples collected at 105 minutes after dissection compared to the control samples (Fig 4c). Overall, the activities of these enzymes in harvested liver tissues were not significantly affected by collection time or storage at -80°C for 1 month. Fig 4. Effects of time-delayed dissections on hepatic enzyme levels. Open in a new tab Activities of three hepatic enzymes, glutathione reductase, GAPDH and catalase, were measured from samples collected at various times post-dissection. Glutathione reductase (A) and GAPDH (B) activity was similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effects observed at any time point. Catalase activities were similar to those of the positive controls; however, samples collected at 105 minutes post-euthanasia displayed significantly lower levels when compared to tissue collected at 65 minutes (C). Activity levels of glutathione reductase and GAPDH were normalized by the total protein concentrations. Catalase activity levels were normalized by catalase protein. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test. Values are means ± SD (n = 4). ** p<0.01Effect of storage duration at -80°C on tissue quality To assess the influence of storage duration on sample quality, spleens and livers were collected per standard laboratory procedures (up to 5 minutes post-euthanasia), and then stored at -80°C for 1, 3.5, 4.5, and 11 months prior to analysis. At all time points investigated, no significant degradation was found in the RNA quality of any of the tissue samples (RIN > 8) (Fig 5). These data demonstrate that quality of the tissues can be maintained for up to 11 months when the tissues are stored at -80°C. Fig 5. Effects of long duration storage at -80°C on RNA quality in spleen and liver. Open in a new tab Spleens and livers were collected up to 5 minutes post-euthanasia. Spleens were preserved in RNAlater, and livers were frozen on dry ice. Samples were stored at -80°C for 1, 3.5, and 11 months for spleen, and 1, 4.5, and 11 months for liver. Samples stored up to 11 months at -80°C resulted in RIN values greater than 8. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Values shown are medians within interquartile (boxes) and full range (whiskers) (n = 4 for all months except for n = 3 for Liver 12 months). * p<0.05Integrity of RNA harvested from whole frozen carcasses To assess RNA quality from whole frozen carcasses (WC), we analyzed the spleen, liver, heart, kidney, and lung dissected from WC that were stored at -80°C for 2.5, 4, and 6–7 months. Results from spleens showed that increased duration at -80°C from 2.5 to 6–7 months caused a 25% decline in RIN values. Long durations of storage (4-7months) had minimal effects on RNA quality of liver, heart, kidney, and lung although RIN values were 6% lower when comparing WC liver at 6–7 months (Fig 6) to fresh liver which was dissected first then frozen for 11 months at -80°C prior to analysis (Fig 5). Fig 6. Integrity of RNA harvested from whole frozen carcasses. Open in a new tab Whole frozen carcasses (WC) were frozen using an aluminum block that was pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen to simulate the freezing kit used on-orbit (2.5, 4 and 6–7 month WC) prior to being placed into a -80°C freezer. Spleen, liver, heart, kidney, and lung were collected within 30 minutes post thawing of the WC, and preserved in RNAlater prior to analysis. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test. Values are means ± SD (n = 9 for 2.5 month, except n = 8 for lung; n = 4, 5, 6, 3, 4 for 4 month spleen, liver, heart, kidney and lung, respectively; n = 3 for 6–7 month). * p<0.05; ** p<0.01Using a separate group of WC we dissected numerous additional tissues and determined the RNA quality. High quality RNA was recovered from various tissues (brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus and hindlimb muscle); RIN values were greater than 7.5 in all tissues (Fig 7a). Small intestine and bone marrow, however, showed severe degradation (RIN values less than 3,) despite rapid preservation in RNAlater at the time of dissection. Additionally, femur, large intestine, and tibia yielded RNA with RIN values less than 5 (Fig 7a). These findings suggest that after long term storage in -80C high quality RNA can be recovered from select tissues of whole carcasses. Fig 7. The effects on RNA quality in various tissues recovered from whole and partially dissected carcasses stored at -80°C for 2.5 months. Open in a new tab Tissue samples were removed from the frozen carcasses for RIN analysis. Tissues were preserved in RNAlater prior to analysis. Brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus, and hindlimb muscles resulted in high RIN values in both WC (A) and PC (B). RNA quality in WC and PC small intestine and bone marrow samples were severely degraded, resulting in RIN values < 3 (A and B). Values are means ± SD (n = 8 for Fig 7A, except n = 7 adrenal gland, n = 5 femur and bone marrow, and n = 4 tibia; n = 4 for Fig 7B, except n = 3 adrenal gland).Integrity of RNA harvested from partially dissected carcasses To determine if the carcasses that were stored after select tissue dissection also can yield high quality samples of other tissue types after long-term storage, tissues were harvested from partially dissected carcasses stored at -80°C for 2.5 months. Similar to the results found as in WC; PC tissue samples resulted in high RNA quality recovered from brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus and hindlimb muscles. Small intestine and bone marrow samples showed severe degradation similar to that seen in WC (Fig 7b).Discussion Our results demonstrated that high quality RNA (RIN> 7) could be isolated from most of the tissues, even from tissues stored for a prolonged period of time (results summarized in Table 1). However, RNA samples isolated from select tissues dissected from frozen carcasses (e.g. spleen, small intestine, bone marrow and mineralized tissues) showed degradation even with short duration storage, probably due to high endogenous RNase activity. Tissues preserved in RNAlater showed significant improvement in RNA quality compared to tissues immersed in liquid nitrogen [22]. In the present study, we observed that freshly harvested spleens preserved in RNAlater showed a higher RIN (RIN >8) compared to spleens dissected from frozen carcasses (RIN = ~5.5). In the absence of RNAlater, liver samples yielded relatively high quality RNA (RIN >6.5). Sample quality collected under various conditions varied depending on tissue type and endpoint measured. Spleens collected up to 100 minutes after euthanasia yielded high quality RNA since they were preserved in RNAlater. Liver tissues collected up to 65 minutes after euthanasia, also yielded high quality samples. However, liver samples showed a significant decline in RNA quality (RIN <8) after 65 minutes post-euthanasia. These data demonstrate that tissues collected with appropriate timing that is typical for laboratory dissections (i.e., up to 30 minutes between euthanasia and tissue collection) can yield samples of acceptable quality to achieve exceptional science return, as expected [23]. These findings are consistent with those of others who showed that RNA samples from tonsils can be stable for several hours, and even after overnight storage at room temperature, RNA did not significantly degrade [6]. However, long-term storage (e.g. 16 hours) at room temperature could result in significant changes in expression levels of some genes. In addition to the time delay in tissue collection and storage, the repetitive freezing and thawing of the snap-frozen tissues could affect RNA integrity. However, RNA degradation in frozen liver tissue did not occur in seconds or over few minutes, but over 30 minutes of thawing at room temperature [18]. Thus, if tissues accidentally are thawed for a brief period, those tissues do not necessarily have to be discarded from gene expression analyses. Schoor et al. report that partially degraded RNA may still be usable even though suboptimal quality [24]. Furthermore, it was reported that RNA with low RIN still allows for reliable monitoring of mRNA expression by qPCR if small amplicon sizes are targeted, although large amplicons failed to generate measurable expression values [25]. These findings, along with our own, allow investigators in the future to use carcass that have been preserved by freezing, to address questions that may arise at a later time. Testing methods in ground based experiments by applying anticipated on-orbit scenarios, reduces the risk of recovering samples of inadequate quality from high cost spaceflight experiments. Spleens and livers collected at various time points post-euthanasia to simulate challenging conditions for dissections in microgravity yielded samples with high RIN values, thus anticipating return of samples with high quality from space even if preservation post-euthanasia is delayed up to 1 hour. When plant samples were placed into a -20°C freezer, severe RNA degradation resulted; however, when the plant samples were preserved in RNAlater and stored at either 4°C or -20°C, the integrity of RNA was maintained. Furthermore, wheat samples preserved in RNAlater from an experiment performed on the ISS, yielded RNA quality comparable to fresh samples, even after undergoing fluctuations of storage temperatures [26]. More recently, RNAlater preserved plant samples were shown to yield sufficient amounts of protein to allow broad-scale proteomics analyses [27]. We showed that multiple tissues collected from frozen carcasses yielded high quality RNA, which could be applied to RNAseq, gene profiling and qPCR. High quality sample recovery for RNA and at least some enzymes is possible from most tissues, despite either delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage. Based on our RIN results, it is our recommendation that the collection of tissue samples occur within 45 minutes for studies requiring high quality RNA and within 85 minutes for usual RNA studies. Should sample retrieval occur from frozen carcasses, our studies show that many, but not all tissues yield high RNA quality up to 7 months storage time at -80°C.Supporting Information S1 File.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Prolonged spaceflight is known to cause vascular deconditioning and remodeling. Tail suspension, a widely used spaceflight analog, is reported to result in vascular remodeling of rats. However, little is known about the cellular atlas of the heterogeneous cells of CA and FA from hindlimb-unloaded rats.Methods Firstly, we leveraged scRNA-seq to perform clustering analysis to identify diverse cell populations and sub-clusters within CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading. The dysregulated genes specific for artery types and cell types in HU group compared to Con were unraveled. Then R package “Cellchat” was used to reveal ligand-receptor cellular communication. At last, the TF network analysis was performed using the SCENIC R package to predict the pivotal TFs in rat artery remodeling induced by hindlimb unloading.Results Clustering analysis identified ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, and a spectrum of immune cells, as well as neuronal and stem cells. Notably, an increased percentage of ECs in the CA and a diminished proportion of SMCs in both CA and FA were observed following tail suspension. Intersection of dysregulated genes specific for artery type and cell type after tail suspension revealed several gene sets involved in ECM remodeling, inflammation, vasoconstriction, etc. Fibroblasts, in particular, exhibited the most significant gene expression variability, highlighting their plasticity. Subclustering within ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts revealed specialized subsets engaged in processes such as EndoMT and cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Additionally, enhanced intercellular interactions among major cell types, especially between SMC and fibroblast, underscored the importance of cell communication in vascular remodeling. Several TFs were identified as potentially influential in the vascular remodeling process under simulated microgravity conditions.Conclusions This study presents the first cellular atlas of the conductive arteries in hindlimb-unloaded rats, revealing a spectrum of dysregulated gene profiles. The identification of the subclusters of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, cellular communication analysis and transcription factors prediction are also included in this work. The findings provide a reference for future research on vascular deconditioning following long-duration spaceflight.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00018-024-05572-x.Keywords: Single-cell RNA sequencing, Weightlessness, Carotid artery, Femoral artery, Cellular communication, Transcription factor",
    "introduction": "Introduction With the increasing frequency of long-duration spaceflights, astronauts are confronted with a myriad of harsh conditions, including radiation, microgravity and circadian rhythm disruptions. These factors precipitate a cascade of cardiovascular changes, initially characterized by fluid shifts from the lower limbs to the head. Subsequent phenomena include decreased circulatory blood volume, diminished diastolic arterial pressure, reduced left ventricular dimensions, and post-flight orthostatic intolerance. Furthermore, there is evidence of accelerated physiological aging in the CA, which appears to be reversible [1]. The structural and functional vascular deconditioning observed in spaceflight has been attributed to alterations in the arterial wall. Studies have documented increased arterial stiffness and reduced compliance in the CA following 6 months of spaceflight, along with increased intima-media thickness in both CA and FA [2]. Several molecular regulators such as osteopontin [3], nuclear factor kappa B [4], and acid sphingomyelinase [5], have been implicated in the regional-specific arterial remodeling induced by weightlessness. However, a systematic genetic and molecular explanation for these vascular changes remains elusive. The vascular tissue is made up of several types of cells such as ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, macrophages, which exhibit different responsiveness to simulated microgravity. Traditional molecular biology techniques have struggled to discern the differential cellular responses to weightless environments, despite previous transcriptomic analyses of the vasculature under microgravity. While ECs and SMCs have been the focus of much research, the roles of fibroblasts and macrophages in vascular remodeling under simulated microgravity have not been well-defined. The advent of scRNA-seq has enabled the exploration of transcriptional heterogeneity across various vascular cell types. In this study, we conducted scRNA-seq on CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of tail suspension and compared them to age-matched controls under normal gravity conditions. This approach aimed to elucidate artery-specific and cell type-specific molecular signatures, identify key cell sub-clusters, assess intercellular communication networks, and identify important transcription factors. Our findings may shed light on the mechanisms underlying the structural and functional vascular changes observed in space.",
    "methods": "Methods Hindlimb unloading treatment A total of 12 male Sprague-Dawley rats (Fourth Military Medical University, Xi’an, China), aged eight weeks and sourced, were randomly allocated to either the hindlimb unloading (HU, n = 6) or the control group (Con, n = 6). The tail suspension technique, a well-established model for simulating microgravity conditions, was employed and has been comprehensively detailed in our previous work [6]. The detailed steps are shown in supplementary methods. Artery dissociation The rats were initially anesthetized using carbon dioxide according to AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2020). Subsequently, they were euthanized through exsanguination, facilitated by a transcardial perfusion with 50 mL of PBS. After the removal of surrounding perivascular adipose and connective tissues, the CA and FA were pooled from 6 rats in each group (Con and HU). As described before [7], the isolated arteries were then sectioned into smaller pieces. These sections were subjected to enzymatic digestion using 2 mg/mL of collagenase I (17018-029, Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and 2 mg/mL of dispase II (D4693, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) in Hank’s balanced salt solution, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The enzymatic digestion process was halted by adding PBS supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, followed by vigorous pipetting for 5 to 10 times to ensure thorough mixing. The resulting cell suspension was then filtered through a 30 μm cell strainer and subsequently centrifuged. ScRNA-seq of CA and FA cells Cells were enumerated using a cell counter and then adjusted to an optimal concentration, ensuring no less than 1000 cells per microliter. Subsequently, the cell suspension was prepared for single-cell sequencing on the 10× Genomics GemCode platform. The cells were combined with enzymes and bonded to Gel Beads, each impregnated with unique barcode information. This mixture was then processed through the 10× Genomics instrument, which encapsulated the cells within oil surfactant droplets to form single-cell GEM. Following this, primers were released and thoroughly mixed with the cell lysates upon the dissolution of the Gel Beads. This facilitated the reverse transcription of barcoded, full-length cDNA. PCR amplification was performed using cDNA as template for library construction. Finally, the libraries were sequenced utilizing the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits, version 3.1. The quality control, normalizing and dimentional reduction are shown in supplementary methods. Clustering, cell type annotation and subclustering of scRNA-seq data The graph-based clustering and the optimal cluster resolution were performed according to previously identified PCs. For visual representation, t-SNE was employed, utilizing the same set of PCs to encapsulate the data’s high-dimensional structure. Cluster identity was assigned by applying the Single R package according to classic cell type markers. Detailed methods are shown in Supplementary methods. For subclustering of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, gene expression data were processed with log-normalization, gene filtration, PCA, clustering, t-SNE. To identify subcluster-specific markers, the FindAllMarkers function from Seurat was utilized, providing a comprehensive set of differentially expressed genes that could distinguish each subcluster. Functional enrichment analysis Differentially expressed genes in specific cell types, clusters and differentially expressed genes between Con and HU were used to perform GO, KEGG and GSVA functional enrichment analysis. Each significantly enriched GO-term refers to a type of ontology which belongs to molecular function, cellular component or biological process. Similarly, KEGG analysis identifies metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways in differentially expressed genes. GSVA was performed using GSVA R package (version 1.26) to identify enriched pathways and cellular processes in different clusters and sub-clusters. Pseudotime trajectory analysis ECs clusters, SMCs and fibroblasts were isolated and reprocessed using Seurat. Then the R package Monocle 2 [8] (version 2.26.0) was used to convert the above Seurat subsets to a Monocle object. The pseudotime kinetics of differentially expressed genes and the heatmap were displayed using the corresponding functions in the R package. Cellular communication analysis Ligand-receptor pair analysis was conducted utilizing R package “Cellchat”. Briefly, the communication probability or interaction strength of a specific ligand-receptor pair was obtained according to the gene expression of signaling ligands, receptors and their cofactors contained in Cellchat software. Our analysis encompassed a spectrum of molecular interactions, including paracrine and autocrine signaling, ECM-receptor interactions, and direct cell-cell contact interactions. The probability of communication at the signaling pathway level was calculated according to the communication probabilities of all ligand-receptor interactions in each signaling pathway. Cell cycle analysis To perform the cell cycle analysis, the Seurat R package was utilized to assign a cell cycle score to each cell by the expression levels of cell cycle markers (15 marker genes for G1 phase, 20 marker genes for S phase, 61 marker genes for G2 phase, 64 marker genes for M phase). Cells were then assigned to G1, S, or G2/M phases based on cell cycle scores. TF analysis Analysis was performed through SCENIC software, which integrates the GENIE3 algorithm, RcisTarget, and AUCell. TFs and their targets were obtained via GENIE3 algorithm. RcisTarget was used to calculate motifs that were significantly enriched in each co-expression module. The potential direct targets of motif were then predicted. We then delineated gene regulatory networks, termed regulons, which encompass both the TFs and their associated target genes. The activity of each regulon was obtained based on normalized AUC score or AUC binary matrix via AUCell R package. Gene regulatory network was done using the cytoscape software. TF analysis in the part of pseudotime trajectory analysis was performed using FIMO tools from MEMEsuite (5.1.0). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at a 5 mm thickness using a cryomicrotome (RM2016, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and these sections were subsequently mounted onto glass microscope slides. The slides were first deparaffinized in xylene I and II (20 min each). Then xylene was eliminated in a graded series of alcohols (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%). The sections were incubated with H&E solution (G1005, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Finally, the stained images were digitized using a Pannoramic MIDI scanner (3DHISTECH, Budapest, Hungary). Immunofluorescent staining Sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (9036-19-5, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and then blocked for 0.5 h with goat serum. Sections were then incubated in primary antibody which was diluted 1:100 in TBST overnight at 4 °C. Following antibodies were used: anti-CD31 (28083-1-AP, Proteintech, Cook County, Illinois, USA), anti-eNOS (27120-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-α-SMA (67735-1-Ig, Proteintech), anti-CD68 (28058-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-CEBPB (66649-1-Ig, Proteintech), anti-SPARC (15274-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-KLF4 (11880-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-SERPINE2 (11303-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-TXNIP (18243-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-FOSB (ab184938, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-ET-1 (DF6125, Affinity Bioscience, Melbourne, Australia), anti-PDGFRα (sc-398206, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA), anti-CXCR4 (sc-53534, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PLN (ab219626, Abcam), anti-DPT (10537-1-AP, Proteintech). After washing with PBS (three times, 5 min each), the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies Fluor488 (1:500 dilution, EK011, Zhuangzhi Biotech, Xi’an, Shaanxi, China) or Cy3 (1:500 dilution, EK022, Zhuangzhi Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Images were scanned with Pannoramic MIDI scanner (3DHISTECH). Statistical analysis Intima-media thickness of CA and FA from Con and HU rats was represented as mean ± standard error of mean. P-value < 0.05 determined by unpaired Student’s t-test was considered statistically significant.",
    "results": "Results Construction of rat single-cell atlases by scRNA-Seq Although scRNA-seq has extensively profiled vascular changes in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, a detailed single-cell analysis of arterial adaptations in hindlimb-suspended rats remains absent. We performed a systematic scRNA-seq study on more than 22,000 cells from rat carotid and femoral arteries. These rats experienced three months of hindlimb unloading, with some serving as controls under normal gravity conditions. (Fig. 1A). After quality control, 6742, 2983, 4487, 2463 cells were acquired in Con-CA (carotid artery in contol group), Con-FA (femoral artery in contol group), HU-CA (carotid artery in hindlimb unloading group) and HU-FA (femoral artery in hindlimb unloading group) datasets (Fig. 1B), which correspond to the median of 2260.5, 2064, 1909 and 1825 genes per cell, respectively. The mean reads per cell were 37,089, 86,801, 62,761 and 113,861 in Con-CA, Con-FA, HU-CA and HU-FA. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of Con and HU CA and FA.

Vascular cell types represented in the distinct clusters included ECs (cluster 5, 7, 11, 13, 20), VSMCs (cluster 0, 3, 9, 10, 14, 15), fibroblasts (cluster 1, 2, 4, 6, 12), macrophages (cluster 8), B cells (cluster 21), T cells (cluster 18), dendritic cells (cluster 17), neutrophil (cluster 19), neuron (cluster 22), and stem cells (cluster 16). The expression of marker genes across the 10 cell clusters were shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S1. We then examined the distribution of major cell types within each group (Fig. 1E, F, Additional file 1: Table. S2). Notably, the proportion of SMCs was elevated in the CA relative to the FA. Interestingly, a reduction in SMC fraction was observed in HU-CA and HU-FA compared to Con (Fig. 1F). This finding contradicts prior studies suggesting that simulated weightlessness stimulates the proliferation of CA SMCs in rats [5]. Additionally, HU-CA demonstrated a higher percentage of ECs compared with Con-CA. Moreover, the HU-FA group exhibited increased percentage of immune cells—comprising B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils—compared to Con-FA. Then, we presented top 5 highest differential expression genes relative to all other cells in each cluster (Fig. 1G). For example, the specific markers of ECs are Mall, Cldn5, Vwf, Mmrn2, Gja5. Vwf is the canonical ECs gene. Cldn5, encoding a tight junction protein, and Mmrn2, encoding an extracellular matrix protein known as Multimerin 2, were also highlighted. The markers of SMCs are Acta1 and potassium channel subfamily K member 3 (Kcnk3). Fibroblast marker is Scara5, a class A scavenger receptor with the clearance function of foreign and endogenous material [9]. Here we also showed the number of upregulated genes with average fold change > 1.28, P value < 0.05 for each cell type compared to all other cells (Fig. 1H). Consistent with previous findings, monocytes including dendritic cells and macrophages have more differentially expressed genes than other cell clusters [10]. Artery-specific differentially expressed genes between con and HU group in ECs and distinct gene expression profiles for EC sub-clusters Currently, there’s no report on gene expression differences in SMCs, ECs, fibroblasts, and immune cells from carotid and femoral arteries under microgravity, mainly because isolating these cell types is difficult. After sequencing of flow-sorted vascular cells, datasets from different cell types were aggregated in this study. We first focused on the differentially expressed genes in ECs between Con and HU (Fig. 2A, B). For ECM remodeling, genes encoding collagen such as col4a1, col4a2 were downregulated in both HU-CA and HU-FA. For secretory function of ECs, the increase of Vcam1 and Nos3 suggested enhanced vasodilatation and adhesion of leukocytes in HU-CA ECs. Downregulation of Edn1 which encodes ET-1 may give rise to decreased vasoconstriction and basal vascular tone in HU-CA. The protein levels of eNOS (Fig. 2C), which was coded by Nos3, and ET-1 (Fig. 2D) were verified by immunofluorescence. Mmrn1 and Vwf were increased in HU-CA, promoting platelet adhesion and clotting [11]. Ccn1, essential for atherogenesis, was reported to be induced by oscillatory shear stress and inhibited by laminar shear stress [12]. It was upregulated in HU-FA but downregulated in HU-CA, highlighting the differential shear stress impacts on the CA and FA. KEGG pathway analysis revealed an upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, such as Rpl37, Rpl36, Rpl35, in ECs from both HU-CA and HU-FA when compared to their Con counterparts (Fig. 2E, F).

(O) Pseudotime trajectories of EC sub-cluster 4 in Con-CA and HU-CA. Scale bar, 40 μmSub-clustering analysis of ECs revealed 6 sub-clusters. Sub-cluster 0 showed high expression of Isl1 (Fig. 2G), a marker of embryonic stem cell-derived progenitors [13], indicating the potential of self-renewal. The sub-cluster also featured increased expression of Bmp6, a gene implicated in osteogenic differentiation of ECs during vascular calcification [14]. This sub-cluster showed enrichment for KEGG terms related to protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2H), which was confirmed by GSVA analysis result that sub-cluster 0 was involved in protein secretion and unfolded protein response (Fig. 2I). Compared to FA, more ECs from CA were in sub-cluster 0 (Fig. 2J). Contrary to sub-cluster 0, sub-cluster 1 demonstrated a more enrichment of cell number in FA (Fig. 2H). Lipe and Gpihbp1, involved in lipolytic process [15], were two markers for sub-cluster 1. Sub-cluster 1 specifically exhibited enrichment for the “Rap1 signaling pathway” and its downstream “PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway” (Fig. 2K), which are known to play roles in cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Consistent with this, Cxcl12, another marker of sub-cluster 1, is recognized for its involvement in endothelial migration [16]. For EC sub-cluster 2, marker genes Rpl30 and Rps25 were crucial for ribosome assembly and protein translation. Consistently, GO enrichment analysis indicated significant enrichment for the terms “Translation” and “Structural constituent of ribosome” in EC sub-cluster 2 (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). The EC sub-cluster 3 expressed Lyve1, a lymphatic endothelial marker, suggesting this population was lymphatic endothelium. The definition of sub-cluster 3 was further confirmed by the elevated expression of Ccl21, a chemokine produced by lymphatic endothelial cells. Notably, there were more lymphatic endothelial cells in FA than that in CA (Fig. 2J). Cnn1, a canonical marker of SMCs and a late indicator of EndoMT, is a hallmark of EC sub-cluster 4 [17]. EndoMT is a process whereby endothelial cells undergo phenotype changes towards to mesenchymal cells such as SMCs and fibroblasts. EndoMT is integral to the pathogenesis of conditions such as hypertension-induced vascular injury [18] and atherosclerosis [19]. The sub-cluster 4 also expresses the myogenic marker Acta2 which encodes α-SMA and Pln which encodes phospholamban, a regulator of ER Ca2+ homeostasis in angiogenesis [20], suggesting a mesenchymal cell phenotype possibly due to EndoMT. To further confirm EndoMT, we compared the differential expression of endothelial cell markers and mesenchymal cell markers between the HU group and the Con group. The dot plot showed that the expression of Tie1, Cdh5, and Vwf was downregulated, whereas the expression of S100a4, Vimentin and smooth muscle cell markers Acta2, Spp1 and Cnn1 was upregulated in EC sub-cluster 4 of HU-CA in comparison with Con counterpart (Additional file 1: Fig. S3A). Moreover, the expression of Cdh5 was decreased and the expression of S100a4, Vimentin was increased in EC sub-cluster 5 of both HU-CA and HU-FA compared to their Con counterparts (Additional file 1: Fig. S3B). Additionally, Cald1 is a molecule that distinguishes smooth muscle cells from fibroblasts, being exclusively expressed in smooth muscle cells [21]. The results demonstrated that the expression of Cald1 in sub-cluster 4 was significantly higher than that in sub-cluster 5 (Additional file 1: Fig. S3C), suggesting the smooth muscle cell phenotype in sub-cluster 4. To delve deeper, we employed pseudotime analysis to simulate the EndoMT transition of EC sub-clusters into fibroblasts and SMCs. As shown in Fig. 2L, a subset of EC sub-cluster 4 appeared to be positioned between the ECs and SMCs in biological evolution. Besides, sub-cluster 5 of ECs was located at the intermediate stage of differentiation between fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Then 3 different cell states were identified: state 1, 2, 3. The ECs were primarily distributed in states 1, located in the initial state of the cell differentiation trajectory. The fibroblasts and SMCs were predominantly distributed in states 2 and 3, representing the final stage of the differentiation trajectory. Subsequently, genes with significant changes over pseudotime were clustered, followed by KEGG enrichment analysis for each cluster (Fig. 2 M). Cluster 1 gene set manifested protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Cluster 2 gene set exhibited enrichment of vascular smooth muscle contraction. Additionally, we used gene clusters 1 and 2 as target genes for TF prediction and found Egr2, Spi1 and Nrf1 may play important roles in the differentiation process of ECs to fibroblasts, and Klf15, Nr5a2 and Zfx may be crucial for the transition of ECs into SMCs (Additional file 1: Fig. S4). We also compared the pseudotime trajectories between CA and FA. It was found that the process of EC sub-cluster 4 differentiating into SMCs occured only in the CA while transition of ECs into fibroblasts occurred in CA and FA (Fig. 2 N). Besides, EC sub-cluster 4 from HU-CA exclusively exhibited differentiation into SMCs compared to Con-CA, as shown in Fig. 2O. Tail suspension simulated weightlessness might also promote transition of EC sub-cluster 4 to fibroblasts in FA (Additional file 1: Fig. S5). Artery-specific differentially expressed genes between con and HU group in SMCs and distinct gene expression profiles for SMC sub-clusters In our study, SMCs exhibited heightened transcription of Acta2 in both HU-CA and HU-FA, signifying an increase in α-SMA levels (Fig. 3A, B). This could explain the observed increase in carotid artery intima-media thickness in tail-suspended rats [5], despite a reduced SMC cell count in HU-CA compared to Con-CA. Our research also confirmed the increased intima-media thickness in HU-CA (Fig. 3C). The selective upregulation of the ryanodine receptor (Trdn), the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel (Cacna1d) and Pln are integral to ER Ca2+ homeostasis [20]. The increased expression of these genes indicated a hypercontractile state in HU-CA SMCs. The protein level of PLN was verified by immunostaining (Fig. 3D). Regarding the ECM, HU-CA SMCs showed a decrease in genes encoding elastin (Eln), collagens (Col1a1, Col4a1, Col6a1), laminins (Lamc1, Lamb1, Lama2), thrombospondins (Thbs2, Thbs3), and fibronectin (Fn1) when compared to Con-CA. Notably, genes encoding components of the ribosome, such as Rpl37 and Rpl41, were upregulated in HU-CA SMCs relative to Con-CA. However, a downregulation of genes Rps2 and Rps27a was noted in HU-FA compared to Con-FA (Fig. 3B, Additional file 1: Fig. S6). Additionally, the expression level of genes (Spp1, Msx2, Bmp2) encoding vascular calcification markers (OPN, MSX2, BMP2) were elevated in HU-FA compared to Con-FA, indicating the tendency of calcification of FA but not CA. Collectively, these results highlighted the heterogeneity between the forebody and hindbody arteries of hindlimb-unloaded rats. This was possibly due to differential transmural pressures across the CA and FA as a result of hindlimb unloading [22]. Fig. 3.

(A, B) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (average log fold change > 0.23, average fold change > 1.28, P value < 0.05) in HU-CA SMCs (A) and HU-FA SMCs (B) in comparison with Con counterparts.

(K) Percentage of cells at different stages of cell cycle in each SMC sub-cluster. (L, M) Go enrichment analysis (L) and KEGG analysis (M) of specific genes in SMC sub-cluster 5. Scale bar, 40 μm. *P < 0.05Sub-clustering analysis of SMCs revealed 6 sub-clusters (Fig. 3E). Sub-cluster 0 was characterized by elevated levels of Col4a6, Acta2, and glutamine synthetase 2 (Gls2), a regulator of glutaminolysis and ferroptosis. The enriched GO term “organonitrogen compound metabolic process” highlighted this sub-cluster’s metabolic role (Fig. 3F). Sub-cluster 1 was marked by the presence of Sacsin, encoding a chaperone involved in intermediate filament assembly [23] and the ryanodine receptor 2 (Ryr2), crucial for calcium release and SMC contraction. Sub-cluster 2 featured the gene for vitronectin (Vtn), an glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion [24], and Higd1b, which maintains mitochondrial integrity under hypoxia [25]. This sub-cluster was more prevalent in the FA than in the CA (Fig. 3G). Sub-cluster 3 was defined by Ndufa4 and Rps20. NDUFA4 is a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain essential for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism [26]. Rps20 encodes a ribosomal protein. The sub-cluster’s contribution to ribosome construction was indicated by the GO terms “structure constituent of ribosome” (Fig. 3H). The markers of sub-cluster 4 are oncofetal gene Gpc3 and SMCs progenitor marker Pi16 [27]. According to GSVA (Fig. 3I), sub-cluster 4 showed enrichment of “Hedgehog signaling pathway” which is essential in embryogenesis and a key regulator of stem cell [28, 29]. High expression of ECM-related genes in this sub cluster, demonstrated by GO enrichment analysis (Fig. 3J), heralded that sub-cluster 4 was major contributor to the surrounding microenvironmental vascular matrix. The marker of sub-cluster 5 Esco2 is involved in tethering between sister chromatids during DNA double-strand break repair [30]. Another marker Gas2l3 is responsible for linking actin and microtubule filaments in interphase of cells and plays a pivotal role in mitosis and cytokinesis [31]. Consistently, GSVA revealed that “G2M checkpoint”, “mitotic spindle signaling pathway” were enriched in SMCs sub-cluster 5. The enrichment of GO term “cell cycle” (Fig. 3K) and the enrichment of KEGG terms “DNA replication” and “spliceosome” (Fig. 3L) further confirmed the role of this sub-cluster in cell cycle. Notably, this sub-cluster had a higher percentage of G2-phase cells and a lower percentage of non-cycling cells compared to others (Fig. 3M). The percentage of sub-cluster 4 and 5 in CA and FA was lower after hindlimb unloading (Fig. 3G), suggesting that hindlimb unloading may inhibit the cell cycle of SMCs. Artery-specific differentially expressed genes between con and HU group in fibroblasts and distinct gene expression profiles for fibroblast sub-clusters The outer adventitia is predominantly composed of collagen and fibroblasts. Fibroblasts showed the greatest number of both downregulated and upregulated genes in HU group compared to Con counterparts across all clusters (Fig. 4A, B), highlighting their high plasticity, which is consistent with previous findings that adventitial plays a pivotal role in vascular remodeling in response to hyperlipidemia or balloon injury [32, 33]. As for ECM, an upregulation of Serpine1 and Serpine2 (Fig. 4C), which encode PAI-1 and PN-1 respectively, indicated heightened antifibrinolytic activity [34] and the limitation in matrix breakdown in HU-CA. The upregulation of Nox4 and Txnip (Fig. 4C, D) may give rise to increased oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation [35] in HU-CA and HU-FA. The marker of fibroblast Pdgfra (Fig. 4C, D), which drives fibrosis and proliferation of fibroblast, was upregulated in both HU-CA and HU-FA. The protein level of TXNIP (Fig. 4E), PDGFRα and SERPINE2 (Fig. 4F) was verified by immunofluorescence. The upregulation of progenitor marker Pi16 (Fig. 4C, D) in HU-CA and HU-FA suggested the increased progenitor group of fibroblasts [27]. Phenotypic transformation of adventitial fibroblasts, which is characterized by elevated expression of Acta2 (Fig. 4C, D), is important in the process of vascular diseases [36]. The upregulation of Acta2 suggested a shift of fibroblasts towards a myofibroblast phenotype in HU-CA and HU-FA. GSVA analysis revealed an enrichment of myogenesis-related genes in HU-CA (Additional file 1: Fig. S7A), hinting at fibroblast involvement in the modulation of intima-media thickness during hindlimb unloading. It is worth noting that, following hindlimb unloading exposure, differentially expressed genes were enriched in metabolic process in fibroblast of CA and FA after microgravity according to GO terms analysis (Fig. 4G, H). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Artery-specific transcriptomic changes during hindlimb unloading and sub-clusters of fibroblasts.

(G) Heatmap of top 5 marker genes of each fibroblast sub-cluster. (H) Go analysis of specific genes in fibroblast sub-cluster 1. (I) GSVA analysis of specific genes in each fibroblast sub-cluster. Scale bar, 40 μmSub-clustering analysis of fibroblasts revealed 5 sub-clusters (Fig. 4I). Col1a1 and the glutamate transporter Slc1a3 were markers for sub-cluster 0. The markers of sub-cluster 1 Mup5 was involved in glucose and lipid metabolism [37]. The enrichment of GO terms (Fig. 4J) and GSVA analysis (Additional file 1: Fig. S7B) confirmed this sub-cluster’s role in glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The marker of fibroblast sub-cluster 2 included Alpl, which is involved in vascular calcification, and F2rl1 which encoded PAR2, a modulator in vascular inflammation and atherogenesis [38]. Sub-cluster 3 maybe progenitor of fibroblast as demonstrated by the expression of Procr, a signature gene providing stem cell signal in various type of cells [39]. Another marker Efhd1 was involved in mitochondrial morphology and energy metabolism in Ca2+ dependent and independent manner [40]. The marker of sub-cluster 4 Spp1 is involved in the process of atherosclerotic plaque formation [41]. GSVA analysis shows an enrichment of genes associated with angiogenesis (Additional file 1: Fig. S7B). Artery-specific differentially expressed genes between con and HU group in macrophages and differentially expressed genes shared across several cell types Macrophages are crucial for angiogenesis [42] and the formation of atherosclerosis plaques [43]. The binding of CXCR4 with chemokine CXCL12 activates of mTOR and NF-κB signaling pathway, which are known to promote cellular growth and proliferation [44]. The upregulation of Cxcr4 in macrophages (Fig. 5A) and the upregulation of Cxcl12 in fibroblasts of HU-CA suggested that the interaction of fibroblast CXCL12 with macrophage CXCR4 might be enhanced. The upregulated protein expression of CXCR4 in HU-CA was verified through immunofluorescence (Fig. 5B). KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that upregulated genes (Jund, Nfkbia, Hsp90ab1) were mainly enriched in IL-17 signalling in HU-CA and HU-FA. The downregulated genes (Cyb, Atp6, Cox2, Nd1, Nd4l, Nd5, Nd6) were mainly enriched in oxidative phosphorylation in HU-FA (Fig. 5A, D, E). Fig. 5.

(H-L) Immunostaining of CEPBPB (H), DPT (I), FOSB (J), SPARC (K), KLF4 (L) in Con and HU-CA. Scale bar, 40 μmThen we scrutinized genes with varying expression levels across multiple cell types to elucidate general vascular remodeling processes (Fig. 5F, J). Notably, several TFs were found to be dysregulated. Klf4, which is involved in the mechanotransduction mechanism and up-regulates many atheroprotective genes [45], was upregulated in HU-CA ECs and fibroblasts as well as in four HU-FA cell types. The upregulation of Cebpb and Cebpd, which encode the transcription factor C/EBPs, was observed across ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts in HU-CA and HU-FA, suggesting the possibility of overall inflammatory state [46]. This was further supported by increased levels of Fosb and Jun, which encode components of the proinflammatory AP1 transcription factor, in several cell types in both HU-CA and HU-FA. Additionally, the exclusive downregulation of ECM–related genes was observed, consistent with previous report that ECM related genes were downregulated in CA of mice [47]. Specifically, Lox, Eln and Dpt were downregulated across HU-CA and HU-FA endothelial cells, SMCs, and fibroblasts, indicating impaired vascular integrity and elasticity. The downregulation of col1a1, col3a1, and Sparc, which are involved in collagen binding and maturation, suggests compromised basal lamina assembly and cellular adhesion [48] in CA and FA after hindlimb unloading. Protein level confirmation was obtained for the upregulation of KLF4, FOSB, CEBPB and the downregulation of SPARC, DPT in HU-CA. (Fig. 5H, I, J, K, L). Cellular communication changes in FA and CA after hindlimb unloading in rats Intercellular communication between heterogenous clusters within artery was revealed leveraging CellChatDB. Among HU-related changes in ligand-receptor pairs in CA and FA, fibroblasts and SMCs played a crucial role in orchestrating intercellular communication changes, as supported by the more pronounced changes in the number of interactions and interaction strength (Fig. 6A, B). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab The effect of hindlimb unloading on intercellular communication between different cell types in CA and FA. (A, B) Circle plot showing the differential number of interactions and differential interaction strength among different artery cell types in HU-CA (A) and HU-FA (B) in comparison with Con counterparts. The red line represented increased number and strength of interaction. The blue line represented the opposite trend. The line thickness is proportional to the number of ligands-receptors pairs and interaction strength. (C, D) Heatmap of incoming signaling patterns (C) and outgoing signaling patterns (D) of different cell types identified by CellChat analysis in Con-CA and HU-CA. (E, F) Heatmap revealing top predicted differential expressed ligand-receptor pairs between different cell types in HU-CA (E) and HU-FA (F) compared to their counterpartsTo elucidate changes in cell-to-cell communication in the CA due to HU, we utilized CellChat analysis to identify key signaling pathways. This analysis underscored the significant role of fibroblasts and SMCs in cellular communication. Specifically, SMCs received signals from Spp1, Laminin, Collagen, Fn1, and Ptn, while fibroblasts were receptive to signals from Mif, Pdgf, and Wnt (Fig. 6C). In terms of signal emission, SMCs released signals including Spp1, Notch, and Ephb, whereas fibroblasts secreted Cd99, Fn1, Sema3, and Igf (Fig. 6D). Then we compared interaction strength between HU-CA and Con-CA (Fig. 6E). For ECM-related ligand-receptor pairs, Col4a1_Sdc4, Col4a4_Sdc4, Fn1_Itga8/Itgb1, Fn1_Sdc4, Lamb2_Itga7/Itgb1 were increased between ECs and SMCs. However, the interactions of ligands including lama4, lama5, lamb1 and lamc1 and receptors including Itga7/Itgb1 and Dag1 within SMCs of CA were decreased after HU. In our study, we also assessed the secreted signaling of specific ligand-receptor pairs. Notably, the anti-inflammatory interaction between Pros1 and Axl was diminished in the communication between fibroblasts and SMCs after HU in CA [49]. Midkine (Mdk), a heparin-binding growth factor involved in cell growth, survival, migration, and angiogenesis [50], exhibited reduced interactions from fibroblasts with its transmembrane receptors Lrp1, Ncl, Sdc2, and Sdc4 on SMCs in HU-CA compared to Con-CA. These ligand-receptor interactions were similarly attenuated within fibroblasts in HU-CA. Furthermore, arterial endothelial Ackr3, known to mediate endothelium-immune cell adhesion [51], showed an increased interaction with Mif from SMCs in HU-CA versus Con-CA. The interaction of Mif_Ackr3 pair was also enhanced within ECs. Additionally, the Pdgfa_Pdgfrb signaling pair was likewise augmented within SMCs. HU-induced alterations in cellular communication within the FA were also characterized. ECs received signals from Vegf, Cdh5, and Jam, while SMCs were responsive to Spp1, Laminin, and Sema3 (Additional file 1: Fig. S8). Post-HU analysis of the FA revealed changes in the interaction strength of specific ligand-receptor pairs (Fig. 6F). Notably, the Sema3c_Plxnd1 pair, which suppresses angiogenesis [52], exhibited reduced signaling between fibroblasts and SMCs in HU-FA compared to Con-FA. In contrast to the CA, the anti-inflammatory Pros1_Axl interaction was enhanced in fibroblast-SMC and fibroblast-fibroblast communications following HU in the FA. The secreted signaling pair Mif_Ackr3 was strengthened in SMCs-fibroblasts and fibroblasts-fibroblasts cell crosstalk. ECM-related pairs including Col1a1_Cd44, Col6a1_ Itga1/Itgb1, Col6a1_Cd44 were diminished in fibroblast-SMC crosstalk. Unlike in the CA, ECM pairs such as Col1a1_Itga1/Itgb1, Col4a1_Itga1/Itgb1, and Col4a1_Cd44 were also reduced in EC-SMC communications after HU in the FA. Furthermore, cell-cell contact interactions, including F11r_Jam3, Jag2_Notch1, Jag2_Notch2, and Jam2_Jam3, were attenuated in EC-SMC crosstalk in HU-FA relative to Con-FA. Transcription factor regulation features in FA and CA after hindlimb unloading in rats We performed SCENIC analysis to identify the key TFs responsible for vascular cell heterogeneity and alterations in transcription during HU. We first explored the cluster-specific TF regulation features. In a heatmap of average regulon activity, we found that Prrx2, Cebpd and Creb3l1 were highlighted in fibroblasts, while Mef2c, crucial for the maturation of smooth muscle cells [53], were exclusively more active in SMCs. SMCs and immune cells showed higher activity of AP-1 family members Junb, Jund and Fosb (Fig. 7A). Subsequently, we discerned differences in regulon activities between the HU and Con groups. The enhanced activity of Mef2a was observed in HU-CA compared to Con-CA. Ets1, which prevents vascular endothelial injury in diabetes [54], was predicted more active both in CA and FA of rats after HU. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Transcription factor analysis in different cell types of CA and FA. (A, B) Heatmap showing the enrichment of TFs based on normalized AUC values in each cell types (A) and in four groups (B). (C) Heatmap showing the activity of regulons within fibroblasts of HU-CA and Con-CA based on the AUC binary matrix.

(E) Heatmap showing the activity of regulons within ECs of HU-CA and Con-CA based on the AUC binary matrix. (F) TFs with significantly changed activity and their targeted genesNext, we studied the differences in TF activity between experimental and control groups within specific cell type. The enhanced activity of inflammation-related Fos, Jun, Cebpb in fibroblast might responsible for vascular remodeling in CA and FA after HU. Compared to the control group, the transcriptional activity of Ddit3, also known as Chop, was significantly increased in fibroblasts of the HU group (Fig. 7C, Additional file 1: Fig. S9A). Ddit3 plays a crucial role in endoplasmic reticulum stress and has recently been found to be important in glucose metabolism [55]. This finding may partially explain the observed changes in metabolic pathways in fibroblasts within the HU group as mentioned earlier (Fig. 5G, H). As of SMC, transcription factors Fos, Fosb, Srf and Jund exhibited differential expression between the CA and FA, while Mef2c is significantly upregulated in both CA and FA after HU (Fig. 7D, Additional file 1: Fig. S9B). Given the pivotal role of Mef2c in smooth muscle differentiation [53], the increased expression of Acta2 in HU-CA and HU-FA might be attributed to the enhanced activity of Mef2c. Zeb1, which is involved in epithelial–mesenchymal transition and plays a protective role in the process of atherosclerosis [56], had elevated activities in SMC of HU-CA (Fig. 7D). Atf4, recognized for its role in angiogenic activation and its ability to heterodimerize with other TFs such as Cebpb and Jund [57], and AP-1 family member Jun and Fos, exhibited greater activity in HU-FA and HU-CA compared to Con groups in EC. Meanwhile, the atheroprotective Klf4 demonstrated heightened activity in ECs of HU-FA but not HU-CA (Fig. 7E, Additional file 1: Fig. S9C). Additionally, we constructed the TF-target gene network of some TFs and noticed that Jun, Fosb and Mef2c shared some target genes. Acta2 is related to Srf and Ets1 according to this network (Fig. 7F), which has enlightening effects on studying the mechanism of Acta2 upregulation in several cell types.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Weightless environment has a wide range of physiological effects on blood vessels. Here, we present a comprehensive CA and FA cell atlas in rats subjected to hindlimb suspension by utilizing scRNA-seq. We observed hindlimb unloading-associated alterations in cell type composition. Cell type-specific and artery type-specific transcriptomic changes were presented. The heterogeneous sub-clusters of the major cell types were then identified. In addition, cellular communication and TF prediction in FA and CA of rats under hindlimb unweighting was described. Our study will collectively provide insights into the mechanisms underlying arterial remodeling in microgravity conditions. The most frequently reported duration for rat tail suspension is 28 days. However, as human spaceflight missions become increasingly prolonged, it is imperative to observe the physiological effects of long-term weightlessness on biological organisms. Consequently, we have extended the duration of rat tail suspension to three months. Using scRNA-sequencing method, we delineated 23 distinct cell clusters, representing the predominant cell types within the CA and FA. A comparative analysis between the HU and Con groups revealed a notable decrease in the proportion of SMCs in both the CA and FA after tail suspension. This observation contradicts earlier studies [5], possibly due to variations in the duration of hindlimb suspension, as vascular remodeling is an ongoing and dynamic process. Furthermore, an elevated proportion of immune cells in the HU-FA suggests heightened inflammation in the femoral arteries of rats subjected to weightlessness. Considering dysregulated genes may be highly specific for different vascular cell types, we provide transcriptomic changes of four major arterial cell types (SMCs, ECs, fibroblasts and macrophages). Notably, fibroblasts from both the CA and FA showed the most significant upregulation and downregulation of genes. This finding underscored their high plasticity and crucial role in vascular remodeling in hindlimb-unloaded rats. The adventitial fibroblast’s role in vascular remodeling is increasingly recognized [58, 59]. However, knowledge about vascular fibroblasts from rats exposed to hindlimb suspension is lacking. ScRNA-seq offers an opportunity to detect gene expression of vascular fibroblasts from HU-CA and HU-FA. The upregulation of Serpine1 and Serpine2 suggested impaired matrix degradation in CA and FA after microgravity. Additionally, the heightened expression of Txnip indicated the elevated oxidative stress and inflammatory state of fibroblasts in HU-CA and HU-FA. Metabolic processes in adventitial fibroblasts were also found to be altered post-hindlimb unloading in the CA and FA, emphasizing the importance of fibroblast metabolic changes in vascular remodeling. This result was consistent with a previous study that highlighted the significant role of metabolic changes in adventitial fibroblasts in the vascular remodeling of pulmonary arterial hypertension in pulmonary hypertension [60]. Considering the distinct hemodynamics between the upper and lower body, we hypothesized differential gene expression in the FA and CA. Our findings confirmed this, with the CA and FA showing some divergent changes. For instance, genes involved in ribosome subunits were upregulated in HU-CA SMCs but downregulated in HU-FA SMCs compared to controls. However, we also found some similarities in arterial changes between CA and FA, suggesting that there may be other factors contributing to arterial remodeling in addition to headward fluid shift under microgravity. Notably, the expression of Acta2, which encodes α-SMA, was enhanced in SMCs of both HU-CA and HU-FA. This, coupled with the reduced proportion of SMCs in the CA and FA, helps us understand the mechanism behind the intima-media thickening in HU-CA. We speculate that the elevated Acta2 expression may predominantly contribute to intima-media thickening in the CA, while the decreased SMC fraction in HU-FA could counteract the increased Acta2 expression. Moreover, the upregulation of inflammation-related TFs (Klf4, Fos, Jun, Cebpb) across several cell types, the upregulation of Cxcr4 in HU-CA and HU-FA macrophages, and heightened Txnip expression in fibroblasts collectively suggest a possible inflammatory state in the circulatory system of hindlimb-unweighted rats. This study reports for the first time the high levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in the upper and lower body blood vessels under simulated weightlessness. This finding was consistent to previous research showing an inflammatory response in the CA of rats subjected to hindlimb unloading [61]. Similarly, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation have been found elevated in astronauts following long-duration spaceflight [62]. Additionally, the downregulation of these genes associated with elastic fibers (Eln), collagens (Col1a1, Col3a1), and other ECM components (Lox, Sparc) in the CA and FA of hindlimb-unweighted rats may partially explain the observed decrease in vascular distensibility and the increased vascular stiffness reported previously [2]. Adding another layer of complexity to vascular remodeling in simulated microgravity, heterogeneous cell types exhibited specific features. ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts were extracted from total cells and divided into several sub-populations, respectively. Our study revealed two EndoMT-related EC sub-clusters which were in the process of differentiation into SMCs and fibroblasts. Notably, only EC sub-cluster 4 from HU-CA was in the process of differentiation into SMCs. This finding was evidenced by the pseudotime analysis. EndoMT is a kind of phenotypic switch through which ECs gain mesenchymal-like properties, resulting in enhanced migration and endothelial dysfunction. Inducers of EndoMT include biochemical and biomechanical stimuli [63]. We postulate that elevated transmural pressure in the CA of rats subjected to tail suspension could be a contributing factor. Another possibility is that increased expression of Serpine1 in fibroblasts mediated EndoMT as previously reported [64]. Endothelial impairment was reported during and after spaceflight [65]. The finding of EndoMT in this study may provide new insight of endothelial impairment. Moreover, we found a sub-cluster of SMCs responsible for DNA replication and mitosis, indicating the highly proliferative activity of this sub-cluster of SMCs. As adjacent component of blood vessels, ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts can communicate with each other through direct contact, paracrine and extracellular vesicles [66]. The communication between ECs and VSMCs has been studied intensively. Here we first reported that the number of significantly enriched ligand-receptor pairs between SMCs and fibroblasts was more than that between other cell types in HU-CA and HU-FA. Some studies have found that SMCs interact with fibroblasts in pathological conditions through extracellular vesicles [36, 67], highlighting the important role of cellular communication between SMCs and fibroblasts in artery remodeling process. This was also demonstrated in our study. Transcription factor network analysis unraveled the high activity of Fos, Jun, Cebpb in ECs and fibroblasts, indicating the hyperinflammatory state in CA and FA. This finding further suggests the important role of AP-1 family members and CEBPs in vascular remodeling in rats under simulated microgravity. Limitations of the study lie in the following aspects. First, most of the descriptive results in our study lack proof of protein level although some are verified using immunofluorescent staining. Second, the relatively small number of some cell types such as T and B immune cells and stem cells limits the research of genetic changes in response to simulated microgravity. Third, our study’s primary focus was on conduit arteries, namely the CA and FA. The impact of modeled microgravity on microcirculatory changes merits further exploration in future studies.",

Copyright notice ID: 11747068 PMID: 39833543 Abstract Background Prolonged spaceflight is known to cause vascular deconditioning and remodeling. Tail suspension, a widely used spaceflight analog, is reported to result in vascular remodeling of rats. However, little is known about the cellular atlas of the heterogeneous cells of CA and FA from hindlimb-unloaded rats.Methods Firstly, we leveraged scRNA-seq to perform clustering analysis to identify diverse cell populations and sub-clusters within CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading. The dysregulated genes specific for artery types and cell types in HU group compared to Con were unraveled. Then R package “Cellchat” was used to reveal ligand-receptor cellular communication. At last, the TF network analysis was performed using the SCENIC R package to predict the pivotal TFs in rat artery remodeling induced by hindlimb unloading.Results Clustering analysis identified ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, and a spectrum of immune cells, as well as neuronal and stem cells. Notably, an increased percentage of ECs in the CA and a diminished proportion of SMCs in both CA and FA were observed following tail suspension. Intersection of dysregulated genes specific for artery type and cell type after tail suspension revealed several gene sets involved in ECM remodeling, inflammation, vasoconstriction, etc. Fibroblasts, in particular, exhibited the most significant gene expression variability, highlighting their plasticity. Subclustering within ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts revealed specialized subsets engaged in processes such as EndoMT and cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Additionally, enhanced intercellular interactions among major cell types, especially between SMC and fibroblast, underscored the importance of cell communication in vascular remodeling. Several TFs were identified as potentially influential in the vascular remodeling process under simulated microgravity conditions.Conclusions This study presents the first cellular atlas of the conductive arteries in hindlimb-unloaded rats, revealing a spectrum of dysregulated gene profiles. The identification of the subclusters of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, cellular communication analysis and transcription factors prediction are also included in this work. The findings provide a reference for future research on vascular deconditioning following long-duration spaceflight.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00018-024-05572-x.Keywords: Single-cell RNA sequencing, Weightlessness, Carotid artery, Femoral artery, Cellular communication, Transcription factorIntroduction With the increasing frequency of long-duration spaceflights, astronauts are confronted with a myriad of harsh conditions, including radiation, microgravity and circadian rhythm disruptions. These factors precipitate a cascade of cardiovascular changes, initially characterized by fluid shifts from the lower limbs to the head. Subsequent phenomena include decreased circulatory blood volume, diminished diastolic arterial pressure, reduced left ventricular dimensions, and post-flight orthostatic intolerance. Furthermore, there is evidence of accelerated physiological aging in the CA, which appears to be reversible [1]. The structural and functional vascular deconditioning observed in spaceflight has been attributed to alterations in the arterial wall. Studies have documented increased arterial stiffness and reduced compliance in the CA following 6 months of spaceflight, along with increased intima-media thickness in both CA and FA [2]. Several molecular regulators such as osteopontin [3], nuclear factor kappa B [4], and acid sphingomyelinase [5], have been implicated in the regional-specific arterial remodeling induced by weightlessness. However, a systematic genetic and molecular explanation for these vascular changes remains elusive. The vascular tissue is made up of several types of cells such as ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, macrophages, which exhibit different responsiveness to simulated microgravity. Traditional molecular biology techniques have struggled to discern the differential cellular responses to weightless environments, despite previous transcriptomic analyses of the vasculature under microgravity. While ECs and SMCs have been the focus of much research, the roles of fibroblasts and macrophages in vascular remodeling under simulated microgravity have not been well-defined. The advent of scRNA-seq has enabled the exploration of transcriptional heterogeneity across various vascular cell types. In this study, we conducted scRNA-seq on CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of tail suspension and compared them to age-matched controls under normal gravity conditions. This approach aimed to elucidate artery-specific and cell type-specific molecular signatures, identify key cell sub-clusters, assess intercellular communication networks, and identify important transcription factors. Our findings may shed light on the mechanisms underlying the structural and functional vascular changes observed in space.Methods Hindlimb unloading treatment A total of 12 male Sprague-Dawley rats (Fourth Military Medical University, Xi’an, China), aged eight weeks and sourced, were randomly allocated to either the hindlimb unloading (HU, n = 6) or the control group (Con, n = 6). The tail suspension technique, a well-established model for simulating microgravity conditions, was employed and has been comprehensively detailed in our previous work [6]. The detailed steps are shown in supplementary methods.Artery dissociation The rats were initially anesthetized using carbon dioxide according to AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2020). Subsequently, they were euthanized through exsanguination, facilitated by a transcardial perfusion with 50 mL of PBS. After the removal of surrounding perivascular adipose and connective tissues, the CA and FA were pooled from 6 rats in each group (Con and HU). As described before [7], the isolated arteries were then sectioned into smaller pieces. These sections were subjected to enzymatic digestion using 2 mg/mL of collagenase I (17018-029, Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and 2 mg/mL of dispase II (D4693, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) in Hank’s balanced salt solution, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The enzymatic digestion process was halted by adding PBS supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, followed by vigorous pipetting for 5 to 10 times to ensure thorough mixing. The resulting cell suspension was then filtered through a 30 μm cell strainer and subsequently centrifuged.ScRNA-seq of CA and FA cells Cells were enumerated using a cell counter and then adjusted to an optimal concentration, ensuring no less than 1000 cells per microliter. Subsequently, the cell suspension was prepared for single-cell sequencing on the 10× Genomics GemCode platform. The cells were combined with enzymes and bonded to Gel Beads, each impregnated with unique barcode information. This mixture was then processed through the 10× Genomics instrument, which encapsulated the cells within oil surfactant droplets to form single-cell GEM. Following this, primers were released and thoroughly mixed with the cell lysates upon the dissolution of the Gel Beads. This facilitated the reverse transcription of barcoded, full-length cDNA. PCR amplification was performed using cDNA as template for library construction. Finally, the libraries were sequenced utilizing the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits, version 3.1. The quality control, normalizing and dimentional reduction are shown in supplementary methods.Clustering, cell type annotation and subclustering of scRNA-seq data The graph-based clustering and the optimal cluster resolution were performed according to previously identified PCs. For visual representation, t-SNE was employed, utilizing the same set of PCs to encapsulate the data’s high-dimensional structure. Cluster identity was assigned by applying the Single R package according to classic cell type markers. Detailed methods are shown in Supplementary methods. For subclustering of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, gene expression data were processed with log-normalization, gene filtration, PCA, clustering, t-SNE. To identify subcluster-specific markers, the FindAllMarkers function from Seurat was utilized, providing a comprehensive set of differentially expressed genes that could distinguish each subcluster.Functional enrichment analysis Differentially expressed genes in specific cell types, clusters and differentially expressed genes between Con and HU were used to perform GO, KEGG and GSVA functional enrichment analysis. Each significantly enriched GO-term refers to a type of ontology which belongs to molecular function, cellular component or biological process. Similarly, KEGG analysis identifies metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways in differentially expressed genes. GSVA was performed using GSVA R package (version 1.26) to identify enriched pathways and cellular processes in different clusters and sub-clusters.Pseudotime trajectory analysis ECs clusters, SMCs and fibroblasts were isolated and reprocessed using Seurat. Then the R package Monocle 2 [8] (version 2.26.0) was used to convert the above Seurat subsets to a Monocle object. The pseudotime kinetics of differentially expressed genes and the heatmap were displayed using the corresponding functions in the R package.Cellular communication analysis Ligand-receptor pair analysis was conducted utilizing R package “Cellchat”. Briefly, the communication probability or interaction strength of a specific ligand-receptor pair was obtained according to the gene expression of signaling ligands, receptors and their cofactors contained in Cellchat software. Our analysis encompassed a spectrum of molecular interactions, including paracrine and autocrine signaling, ECM-receptor interactions, and direct cell-cell contact interactions. The probability of communication at the signaling pathway level was calculated according to the communication probabilities of all ligand-receptor interactions in each signaling pathway.Cell cycle analysis To perform the cell cycle analysis, the Seurat R package was utilized to assign a cell cycle score to each cell by the expression levels of cell cycle markers (15 marker genes for G1 phase, 20 marker genes for S phase, 61 marker genes for G2 phase, 64 marker genes for M phase). Cells were then assigned to G1, S, or G2/M phases based on cell cycle scores.TF analysis Analysis was performed through SCENIC software, which integrates the GENIE3 algorithm, RcisTarget, and AUCell. TFs and their targets were obtained via GENIE3 algorithm. RcisTarget was used to calculate motifs that were significantly enriched in each co-expression module. The potential direct targets of motif were then predicted. We then delineated gene regulatory networks, termed regulons, which encompass both the TFs and their associated target genes. The activity of each regulon was obtained based on normalized AUC score or AUC binary matrix via AUCell R package. Gene regulatory network was done using the cytoscape software. TF analysis in the part of pseudotime trajectory analysis was performed using FIMO tools from MEMEsuite (5.1.0).Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at a 5 mm thickness using a cryomicrotome (RM2016, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and these sections were subsequently mounted onto glass microscope slides. The slides were first deparaffinized in xylene I and II (20 min each). Then xylene was eliminated in a graded series of alcohols (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%). The sections were incubated with H&E solution (G1005, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Finally, the stained images were digitized using a Pannoramic MIDI scanner (3DHISTECH, Budapest, Hungary).Immunofluorescent staining Sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (9036-19-5, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and then blocked for 0.5 h with goat serum. Sections were then incubated in primary antibody which was diluted 1:100 in TBST overnight at 4 °C. Following antibodies were used: anti-CD31 (28083-1-AP, Proteintech, Cook County, Illinois, USA), anti-eNOS (27120-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-α-SMA (67735-1-Ig, Proteintech), anti-CD68 (28058-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-CEBPB (66649-1-Ig, Proteintech), anti-SPARC (15274-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-KLF4 (11880-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-SERPINE2 (11303-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-TXNIP (18243-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-FOSB (ab184938, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-ET-1 (DF6125, Affinity Bioscience, Melbourne, Australia), anti-PDGFRα (sc-398206, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA), anti-CXCR4 (sc-53534, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PLN (ab219626, Abcam), anti-DPT (10537-1-AP, Proteintech). After washing with PBS (three times, 5 min each), the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies Fluor488 (1:500 dilution, EK011, Zhuangzhi Biotech, Xi’an, Shaanxi, China) or Cy3 (1:500 dilution, EK022, Zhuangzhi Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Images were scanned with Pannoramic MIDI scanner (3DHISTECH).Statistical analysis Intima-media thickness of CA and FA from Con and HU rats was represented as mean ± standard error of mean. P-value < 0.05 determined by unpaired Student’s t-test was considered statistically significant.Results Construction of rat single-cell atlases by scRNA-Seq Although scRNA-seq has extensively profiled vascular changes in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, a detailed single-cell analysis of arterial adaptations in hindlimb-suspended rats remains absent. We performed a systematic scRNA-seq study on more than 22,000 cells from rat carotid and femoral arteries. These rats experienced three months of hindlimb unloading, with some serving as controls under normal gravity conditions. (Fig. 1A). After quality control, 6742, 2983, 4487, 2463 cells were acquired in Con-CA (carotid artery in contol group), Con-FA (femoral artery in contol group), HU-CA (carotid artery in hindlimb unloading group) and HU-FA (femoral artery in hindlimb unloading group) datasets (Fig. 1B), which correspond to the median of 2260.5, 2064, 1909 and 1825 genes per cell, respectively. The mean reads per cell were 37,089, 86,801, 62,761 and 113,861 in Con-CA, Con-FA, HU-CA and HU-FA. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of Con and HU CA and FA. (A) Overview of experimental design and approach. CA and FA were collected from rats subjected to 3 months hindlimb unloading (HU) or exposed to normal gravity (Con). Then the single-cell suspension was sequenced using scRNA-seq method. Bioinformatics analysis was performed according to the results of scRNA-seq.

(G) Dot plot demonstrates the top 5 highest differential expression genes relative to all other cells in each type. Dot size corresponds to proportion of cells within the group expressing each transcript, and dot color corresponds to expression level. (H) The number of differentially expressed genes in each cell type compared to other cell typesIndividual clusters were labeled for cell type with known marker genes. In total, we identified 23 cell clusters (Fig. 1C) that could be divided into 10 major cell types (Fig. 1D). Integrated datasets of above four groups displayed satisfactory alignment. Known markers used to divide cell types were shown in Additional file 1: Table. S1. Vascular cell types represented in the distinct clusters included ECs (cluster 5, 7, 11, 13, 20), VSMCs (cluster 0, 3, 9, 10, 14, 15), fibroblasts (cluster 1, 2, 4, 6, 12), macrophages (cluster 8), B cells (cluster 21), T cells (cluster 18), dendritic cells (cluster 17), neutrophil (cluster 19), neuron (cluster 22), and stem cells (cluster 16). The expression of marker genes across the 10 cell clusters were shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S1. We then examined the distribution of major cell types within each group (Fig. 1E, F, Additional file 1: Table. S2). Notably, the proportion of SMCs was elevated in the CA relative to the FA. Interestingly, a reduction in SMC fraction was observed in HU-CA and HU-FA compared to Con (Fig. 1F). This finding contradicts prior studies suggesting that simulated weightlessness stimulates the proliferation of CA SMCs in rats [5]. Additionally, HU-CA demonstrated a higher percentage of ECs compared with Con-CA. Moreover, the HU-FA group exhibited increased percentage of immune cells—comprising B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils—compared to Con-FA. Then, we presented top 5 highest differential expression genes relative to all other cells in each cluster (Fig. 1G). For example, the specific markers of ECs are Mall, Cldn5, Vwf, Mmrn2, Gja5. Vwf is the canonical ECs gene. Cldn5, encoding a tight junction protein, and Mmrn2, encoding an extracellular matrix protein known as Multimerin 2, were also highlighted. The markers of SMCs are Acta1 and potassium channel subfamily K member 3 (Kcnk3). Fibroblast marker is Scara5, a class A scavenger receptor with the clearance function of foreign and endogenous material [9]. Here we also showed the number of upregulated genes with average fold change > 1.28, P value < 0.05 for each cell type compared to all other cells (Fig. 1H). Consistent with previous findings, monocytes including dendritic cells and macrophages have more differentially expressed genes than other cell clusters [10].Artery-specific differentially expressed genes between con and HU group in ECs and distinct gene expression profiles for EC sub-clusters Currently, there’s no report on gene expression differences in SMCs, ECs, fibroblasts, and immune cells from carotid and femoral arteries under microgravity, mainly because isolating these cell types is difficult. After sequencing of flow-sorted vascular cells, datasets from different cell types were aggregated in this study. We first focused on the differentially expressed genes in ECs between Con and HU (Fig. 2A, B). For ECM remodeling, genes encoding collagen such as col4a1, col4a2 were downregulated in both HU-CA and HU-FA. For secretory function of ECs, the increase of Vcam1 and Nos3 suggested enhanced vasodilatation and adhesion of leukocytes in HU-CA ECs. Downregulation of Edn1 which encodes ET-1 may give rise to decreased vasoconstriction and basal vascular tone in HU-CA. The protein levels of eNOS (Fig. 2C), which was coded by Nos3, and ET-1 (Fig. 2D) were verified by immunofluorescence. Mmrn1 and Vwf were increased in HU-CA, promoting platelet adhesion and clotting [11]. Ccn1, essential for atherogenesis, was reported to be induced by oscillatory shear stress and inhibited by laminar shear stress [12]. It was upregulated in HU-FA but downregulated in HU-CA, highlighting the differential shear stress impacts on the CA and FA. KEGG pathway analysis revealed an upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, such as Rpl37, Rpl36, Rpl35, in ECs from both HU-CA and HU-FA when compared to their Con counterparts (Fig. 2E, F).

(O) Pseudotime trajectories of EC sub-cluster 4 in Con-CA and HU-CA. Scale bar, 40 μmSub-clustering analysis of ECs revealed 6 sub-clusters. Sub-cluster 0 showed high expression of Isl1 (Fig. 2G), a marker of embryonic stem cell-derived progenitors [13], indicating the potential of self-renewal. The sub-cluster also featured increased expression of Bmp6, a gene implicated in osteogenic differentiation of ECs during vascular calcification [14]. This sub-cluster showed enrichment for KEGG terms related to protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2H), which was confirmed by GSVA analysis result that sub-cluster 0 was involved in protein secretion and unfolded protein response (Fig. 2I). Compared to FA, more ECs from CA were in sub-cluster 0 (Fig. 2J). Contrary to sub-cluster 0, sub-cluster 1 demonstrated a more enrichment of cell number in FA (Fig. 2H). Lipe and Gpihbp1, involved in lipolytic process [15], were two markers for sub-cluster 1. Sub-cluster 1 specifically exhibited enrichment for the “Rap1 signaling pathway” and its downstream “PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway” (Fig. 2K), which are known to play roles in cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Consistent with this, Cxcl12, another marker of sub-cluster 1, is recognized for its involvement in endothelial migration [16]. For EC sub-cluster 2, marker genes Rpl30 and Rps25 were crucial for ribosome assembly and protein translation. Consistently, GO enrichment analysis indicated significant enrichment for the terms “Translation” and “Structural constituent of ribosome” in EC sub-cluster 2 (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). The EC sub-cluster 3 expressed Lyve1, a lymphatic endothelial marker, suggesting this population was lymphatic endothelium. The definition of sub-cluster 3 was further confirmed by the elevated expression of Ccl21, a chemokine produced by lymphatic endothelial cells. Notably, there were more lymphatic endothelial cells in FA than that in CA (Fig. 2J). Cnn1, a canonical marker of SMCs and a late indicator of EndoMT, is a hallmark of EC sub-cluster 4 [17]. EndoMT is a process whereby endothelial cells undergo phenotype changes towards to mesenchymal cells such as SMCs and fibroblasts. EndoMT is integral to the pathogenesis of conditions such as hypertension-induced vascular injury [18] and atherosclerosis [19]. The sub-cluster 4 also expresses the myogenic marker Acta2 which encodes α-SMA and Pln which encodes phospholamban, a regulator of ER Ca2+ homeostasis in angiogenesis [20], suggesting a mesenchymal cell phenotype possibly due to EndoMT. To further confirm EndoMT, we compared the differential expression of endothelial cell markers and mesenchymal cell markers between the HU group and the Con group. The dot plot showed that the expression of Tie1, Cdh5, and Vwf was downregulated, whereas the expression of S100a4, Vimentin and smooth muscle cell markers Acta2, Spp1 and Cnn1 was upregulated in EC sub-cluster 4 of HU-CA in comparison with Con counterpart (Additional file 1: Fig. S3A). Moreover, the expression of Cdh5 was decreased and the expression of S100a4, Vimentin was increased in EC sub-cluster 5 of both HU-CA and HU-FA compared to their Con counterparts (Additional file 1: Fig. S3B). Additionally, Cald1 is a molecule that distinguishes smooth muscle cells from fibroblasts, being exclusively expressed in smooth muscle cells [21]. The results demonstrated that the expression of Cald1 in sub-cluster 4 was significantly higher than that in sub-cluster 5 (Additional file 1: Fig. S3C), suggesting the smooth muscle cell phenotype in sub-cluster 4. To delve deeper, we employed pseudotime analysis to simulate the EndoMT transition of EC sub-clusters into fibroblasts and SMCs. As shown in Fig. 2L, a subset of EC sub-cluster 4 appeared to be positioned between the ECs and SMCs in biological evolution. Besides, sub-cluster 5 of ECs was located at the intermediate stage of differentiation between fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Then 3 different cell states were identified: state 1, 2, 3. The ECs were primarily distributed in states 1, located in the initial state of the cell differentiation trajectory. The fibroblasts and SMCs were predominantly distributed in states 2 and 3, representing the final stage of the differentiation trajectory. Subsequently, genes with significant changes over pseudotime were clustered, followed by KEGG enrichment analysis for each cluster (Fig. 2 M). Cluster 1 gene set manifested protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Cluster 2 gene set exhibited enrichment of vascular smooth muscle contraction. Additionally, we used gene clusters 1 and 2 as target genes for TF prediction and found Egr2, Spi1 and Nrf1 may play important roles in the differentiation process of ECs to fibroblasts, and Klf15, Nr5a2 and Zfx may be crucial for the transition of ECs into SMCs (Additional file 1: Fig. S4). We also compared the pseudotime trajectories between CA and FA. It was found that the process of EC sub-cluster 4 differentiating into SMCs occured only in the CA while transition of ECs into fibroblasts occurred in CA and FA (Fig. 2 N). Besides, EC sub-cluster 4 from HU-CA exclusively exhibited differentiation into SMCs compared to Con-CA, as shown in Fig. 2O. Tail suspension simulated weightlessness might also promote transition of EC sub-cluster 4 to fibroblasts in FA (Additional file 1: Fig. S5).Artery-specific differentially expressed genes between con and HU group in SMCs and distinct gene expression profiles for SMC sub-clusters In our study, SMCs exhibited heightened transcription of Acta2 in both HU-CA and HU-FA, signifying an increase in α-SMA levels (Fig. 3A, B). This could explain the observed increase in carotid artery intima-media thickness in tail-suspended rats [5], despite a reduced SMC cell count in HU-CA compared to Con-CA. Our research also confirmed the increased intima-media thickness in HU-CA (Fig. 3C). The selective upregulation of the ryanodine receptor (Trdn), the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel (Cacna1d) and Pln are integral to ER Ca2+ homeostasis [20]. The increased expression of these genes indicated a hypercontractile state in HU-CA SMCs. The protein level of PLN was verified by immunostaining (Fig. 3D). Regarding the ECM, HU-CA SMCs showed a decrease in genes encoding elastin (Eln), collagens (Col1a1, Col4a1, Col6a1), laminins (Lamc1, Lamb1, Lama2), thrombospondins (Thbs2, Thbs3), and fibronectin (Fn1) when compared to Con-CA. Notably, genes encoding components of the ribosome, such as Rpl37 and Rpl41, were upregulated in HU-CA SMCs relative to Con-CA. However, a downregulation of genes Rps2 and Rps27a was noted in HU-FA compared to Con-FA (Fig. 3B, Additional file 1: Fig. S6). Additionally, the expression level of genes (Spp1, Msx2, Bmp2) encoding vascular calcification markers (OPN, MSX2, BMP2) were elevated in HU-FA compared to Con-FA, indicating the tendency of calcification of FA but not CA. Collectively, these results highlighted the heterogeneity between the forebody and hindbody arteries of hindlimb-unloaded rats. This was possibly due to differential transmural pressures across the CA and FA as a result of hindlimb unloading [22]. Fig. 3.

Scale bar, 40 μm. *P < 0.05Sub-clustering analysis of SMCs revealed 6 sub-clusters (Fig. 3E). Sub-cluster 0 was characterized by elevated levels of Col4a6, Acta2, and glutamine synthetase 2 (Gls2), a regulator of glutaminolysis and ferroptosis. The enriched GO term “organonitrogen compound metabolic process” highlighted this sub-cluster’s metabolic role (Fig. 3F). Sub-cluster 1 was marked by the presence of Sacsin, encoding a chaperone involved in intermediate filament assembly [23] and the ryanodine receptor 2 (Ryr2), crucial for calcium release and SMC contraction. Sub-cluster 2 featured the gene for vitronectin (Vtn), an glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion [24], and Higd1b, which maintains mitochondrial integrity under hypoxia [25]. This sub-cluster was more prevalent in the FA than in the CA (Fig. 3G). Sub-cluster 3 was defined by Ndufa4 and Rps20. NDUFA4 is a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain essential for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism [26]. Rps20 encodes a ribosomal protein. The sub-cluster’s contribution to ribosome construction was indicated by the GO terms “structure constituent of ribosome” (Fig. 3H). The markers of sub-cluster 4 are oncofetal gene Gpc3 and SMCs progenitor marker Pi16 [27]. According to GSVA (Fig. 3I), sub-cluster 4 showed enrichment of “Hedgehog signaling pathway” which is essential in embryogenesis and a key regulator of stem cell [28, 29]. High expression of ECM-related genes in this sub cluster, demonstrated by GO enrichment analysis (Fig. 3J), heralded that sub-cluster 4 was major contributor to the surrounding microenvironmental vascular matrix. The marker of sub-cluster 5 Esco2 is involved in tethering between sister chromatids during DNA double-strand break repair [30]. Another marker Gas2l3 is responsible for linking actin and microtubule filaments in interphase of cells and plays a pivotal role in mitosis and cytokinesis [31]. Consistently, GSVA revealed that “G2M checkpoint”, “mitotic spindle signaling pathway” were enriched in SMCs sub-cluster 5. The enrichment of GO term “cell cycle” (Fig. 3K) and the enrichment of KEGG terms “DNA replication” and “spliceosome” (Fig. 3L) further confirmed the role of this sub-cluster in cell cycle. Notably, this sub-cluster had a higher percentage of G2-phase cells and a lower percentage of non-cycling cells compared to others (Fig. 3M). The percentage of sub-cluster 4 and 5 in CA and FA was lower after hindlimb unloading (Fig. 3G), suggesting that hindlimb unloading may inhibit the cell cycle of SMCs.Artery-specific differentially expressed genes between con and HU group in fibroblasts and distinct gene expression profiles for fibroblast sub-clusters The outer adventitia is predominantly composed of collagen and fibroblasts. Fibroblasts showed the greatest number of both downregulated and upregulated genes in HU group compared to Con counterparts across all clusters (Fig. 4A, B), highlighting their high plasticity, which is consistent with previous findings that adventitial plays a pivotal role in vascular remodeling in response to hyperlipidemia or balloon injury [32, 33]. As for ECM, an upregulation of Serpine1 and Serpine2 (Fig. 4C), which encode PAI-1 and PN-1 respectively, indicated heightened antifibrinolytic activity [34] and the limitation in matrix breakdown in HU-CA. The upregulation of Nox4 and Txnip (Fig. 4C, D) may give rise to increased oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation [35] in HU-CA and HU-FA. The marker of fibroblast Pdgfra (Fig. 4C, D), which drives fibrosis and proliferation of fibroblast, was upregulated in both HU-CA and HU-FA. The protein level of TXNIP (Fig. 4E), PDGFRα and SERPINE2 (Fig. 4F) was verified by immunofluorescence. The upregulation of progenitor marker Pi16 (Fig. 4C, D) in HU-CA and HU-FA suggested the increased progenitor group of fibroblasts [27]. Phenotypic transformation of adventitial fibroblasts, which is characterized by elevated expression of Acta2 (Fig. 4C, D), is important in the process of vascular diseases [36]. The upregulation of Acta2 suggested a shift of fibroblasts towards a myofibroblast phenotype in HU-CA and HU-FA. GSVA analysis revealed an enrichment of myogenesis-related genes in HU-CA (Additional file 1: Fig. S7A), hinting at fibroblast involvement in the modulation of intima-media thickness during hindlimb unloading. It is worth noting that, following hindlimb unloading exposure, differentially expressed genes were enriched in metabolic process in fibroblast of CA and FA after microgravity according to GO terms analysis (Fig. 4G, H). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Artery-specific transcriptomic changes during hindlimb unloading and sub-clusters of fibroblasts.

(G) Heatmap of top 5 marker genes of each fibroblast sub-cluster. (H) Go analysis of specific genes in fibroblast sub-cluster 1. (I) GSVA analysis of specific genes in each fibroblast sub-cluster. Scale bar, 40 μmSub-clustering analysis of fibroblasts revealed 5 sub-clusters (Fig. 4I). Col1a1 and the glutamate transporter Slc1a3 were markers for sub-cluster 0. The markers of sub-cluster 1 Mup5 was involved in glucose and lipid metabolism [37]. The enrichment of GO terms (Fig. 4J) and GSVA analysis (Additional file 1: Fig. S7B) confirmed this sub-cluster’s role in glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The marker of fibroblast sub-cluster 2 included Alpl, which is involved in vascular calcification, and F2rl1 which encoded PAR2, a modulator in vascular inflammation and atherogenesis [38]. Sub-cluster 3 maybe progenitor of fibroblast as demonstrated by the expression of Procr, a signature gene providing stem cell signal in various type of cells [39]. Another marker Efhd1 was involved in mitochondrial morphology and energy metabolism in Ca2+ dependent and independent manner [40]. The marker of sub-cluster 4 Spp1 is involved in the process of atherosclerotic plaque formation [41]. GSVA analysis shows an enrichment of genes associated with angiogenesis (Additional file 1: Fig. S7B).Artery-specific differentially expressed genes between con and HU group in macrophages and differentially expressed genes shared across several cell types Macrophages are crucial for angiogenesis [42] and the formation of atherosclerosis plaques [43]. The binding of CXCR4 with chemokine CXCL12 activates of mTOR and NF-κB signaling pathway, which are known to promote cellular growth and proliferation [44]. The upregulation of Cxcr4 in macrophages (Fig. 5A) and the upregulation of Cxcl12 in fibroblasts of HU-CA suggested that the interaction of fibroblast CXCL12 with macrophage CXCR4 might be enhanced. The upregulated protein expression of CXCR4 in HU-CA was verified through immunofluorescence (Fig. 5B). KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that upregulated genes (Jund, Nfkbia, Hsp90ab1) were mainly enriched in IL-17 signalling in HU-CA and HU-FA. The downregulated genes (Cyb, Atp6, Cox2, Nd1, Nd4l, Nd5, Nd6) were mainly enriched in oxidative phosphorylation in HU-FA (Fig. 5A, D, E). Fig. 5.

(H-L) Immunostaining of CEPBPB (H), DPT (I), FOSB (J), SPARC (K), KLF4 (L) in Con and HU-CA. Scale bar, 40 μmThen we scrutinized genes with varying expression levels across multiple cell types to elucidate general vascular remodeling processes (Fig. 5F, J). Notably, several TFs were found to be dysregulated. Klf4, which is involved in the mechanotransduction mechanism and up-regulates many atheroprotective genes [45], was upregulated in HU-CA ECs and fibroblasts as well as in four HU-FA cell types. The upregulation of Cebpb and Cebpd, which encode the transcription factor C/EBPs, was observed across ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts in HU-CA and HU-FA, suggesting the possibility of overall inflammatory state [46]. This was further supported by increased levels of Fosb and Jun, which encode components of the proinflammatory AP1 transcription factor, in several cell types in both HU-CA and HU-FA. Additionally, the exclusive downregulation of ECM–related genes was observed, consistent with previous report that ECM related genes were downregulated in CA of mice [47]. Specifically, Lox, Eln and Dpt were downregulated across HU-CA and HU-FA endothelial cells, SMCs, and fibroblasts, indicating impaired vascular integrity and elasticity. The downregulation of col1a1, col3a1, and Sparc, which are involved in collagen binding and maturation, suggests compromised basal lamina assembly and cellular adhesion [48] in CA and FA after hindlimb unloading. Protein level confirmation was obtained for the upregulation of KLF4, FOSB, CEBPB and the downregulation of SPARC, DPT in HU-CA. (Fig. 5H, I, J, K, L).Cellular communication changes in FA and CA after hindlimb unloading in rats Intercellular communication between heterogenous clusters within artery was revealed leveraging CellChatDB. Among HU-related changes in ligand-receptor pairs in CA and FA, fibroblasts and SMCs played a crucial role in orchestrating intercellular communication changes, as supported by the more pronounced changes in the number of interactions and interaction strength (Fig. 6A, B). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab The effect of hindlimb unloading on intercellular communication between different cell types in CA and FA. (A, B) Circle plot showing the differential number of interactions and differential interaction strength among different artery cell types in HU-CA (A) and HU-FA (B) in comparison with Con counterparts. The red line represented increased number and strength of interaction. The blue line represented the opposite trend. The line thickness is proportional to the number of ligands-receptors pairs and interaction strength. (C, D) Heatmap of incoming signaling patterns (C) and outgoing signaling patterns (D) of different cell types identified by CellChat analysis in Con-CA and HU-CA. (E, F) Heatmap revealing top predicted differential expressed ligand-receptor pairs between different cell types in HU-CA (E) and HU-FA (F) compared to their counterpartsTo elucidate changes in cell-to-cell communication in the CA due to HU, we utilized CellChat analysis to identify key signaling pathways. This analysis underscored the significant role of fibroblasts and SMCs in cellular communication. Specifically, SMCs received signals from Spp1, Laminin, Collagen, Fn1, and Ptn, while fibroblasts were receptive to signals from Mif, Pdgf, and Wnt (Fig. 6C). In terms of signal emission, SMCs released signals including Spp1, Notch, and Ephb, whereas fibroblasts secreted Cd99, Fn1, Sema3, and Igf (Fig. 6D). Then we compared interaction strength between HU-CA and Con-CA (Fig. 6E). For ECM-related ligand-receptor pairs, Col4a1_Sdc4, Col4a4_Sdc4, Fn1_Itga8/Itgb1, Fn1_Sdc4, Lamb2_Itga7/Itgb1 were increased between ECs and SMCs. However, the interactions of ligands including lama4, lama5, lamb1 and lamc1 and receptors including Itga7/Itgb1 and Dag1 within SMCs of CA were decreased after HU. In our study, we also assessed the secreted signaling of specific ligand-receptor pairs. Notably, the anti-inflammatory interaction between Pros1 and Axl was diminished in the communication between fibroblasts and SMCs after HU in CA [49]. Midkine (Mdk), a heparin-binding growth factor involved in cell growth, survival, migration, and angiogenesis [50], exhibited reduced interactions from fibroblasts with its transmembrane receptors Lrp1, Ncl, Sdc2, and Sdc4 on SMCs in HU-CA compared to Con-CA. These ligand-receptor interactions were similarly attenuated within fibroblasts in HU-CA. Furthermore, arterial endothelial Ackr3, known to mediate endothelium-immune cell adhesion [51], showed an increased interaction with Mif from SMCs in HU-CA versus Con-CA. The interaction of Mif_Ackr3 pair was also enhanced within ECs. Additionally, the Pdgfa_Pdgfrb signaling pair was likewise augmented within SMCs. HU-induced alterations in cellular communication within the FA were also characterized. ECs received signals from Vegf, Cdh5, and Jam, while SMCs were responsive to Spp1, Laminin, and Sema3 (Additional file 1: Fig. S8). Post-HU analysis of the FA revealed changes in the interaction strength of specific ligand-receptor pairs (Fig. 6F). Notably, the Sema3c_Plxnd1 pair, which suppresses angiogenesis [52], exhibited reduced signaling between fibroblasts and SMCs in HU-FA compared to Con-FA. In contrast to the CA, the anti-inflammatory Pros1_Axl interaction was enhanced in fibroblast-SMC and fibroblast-fibroblast communications following HU in the FA. The secreted signaling pair Mif_Ackr3 was strengthened in SMCs-fibroblasts and fibroblasts-fibroblasts cell crosstalk. ECM-related pairs including Col1a1_Cd44, Col6a1_ Itga1/Itgb1, Col6a1_Cd44 were diminished in fibroblast-SMC crosstalk. Unlike in the CA, ECM pairs such as Col1a1_Itga1/Itgb1, Col4a1_Itga1/Itgb1, and Col4a1_Cd44 were also reduced in EC-SMC communications after HU in the FA. Furthermore, cell-cell contact interactions, including F11r_Jam3, Jag2_Notch1, Jag2_Notch2, and Jam2_Jam3, were attenuated in EC-SMC crosstalk in HU-FA relative to Con-FA.Transcription factor regulation features in FA and CA after hindlimb unloading in rats We performed SCENIC analysis to identify the key TFs responsible for vascular cell heterogeneity and alterations in transcription during HU. We first explored the cluster-specific TF regulation features. In a heatmap of average regulon activity, we found that Prrx2, Cebpd and Creb3l1 were highlighted in fibroblasts, while Mef2c, crucial for the maturation of smooth muscle cells [53], were exclusively more active in SMCs. SMCs and immune cells showed higher activity of AP-1 family members Junb, Jund and Fosb (Fig. 7A). Subsequently, we discerned differences in regulon activities between the HU and Con groups. The enhanced activity of Mef2a was observed in HU-CA compared to Con-CA. Ets1, which prevents vascular endothelial injury in diabetes [54], was predicted more active both in CA and FA of rats after HU. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Transcription factor analysis in different cell types of CA and FA. (A, B) Heatmap showing the enrichment of TFs based on normalized AUC values in each cell types (A) and in four groups (B). (C) Heatmap showing the activity of regulons within fibroblasts of HU-CA and Con-CA based on the AUC binary matrix.

(E) Heatmap showing the activity of regulons within ECs of HU-CA and Con-CA based on the AUC binary matrix. (F) TFs with significantly changed activity and their targeted genesNext, we studied the differences in TF activity between experimental and control groups within specific cell type. The enhanced activity of inflammation-related Fos, Jun, Cebpb in fibroblast might responsible for vascular remodeling in CA and FA after HU. Compared to the control group, the transcriptional activity of Ddit3, also known as Chop, was significantly increased in fibroblasts of the HU group (Fig. 7C, Additional file 1: Fig. S9A). Ddit3 plays a crucial role in endoplasmic reticulum stress and has recently been found to be important in glucose metabolism [55]. This finding may partially explain the observed changes in metabolic pathways in fibroblasts within the HU group as mentioned earlier (Fig. 5G, H). As of SMC, transcription factors Fos, Fosb, Srf and Jund exhibited differential expression between the CA and FA, while Mef2c is significantly upregulated in both CA and FA after HU (Fig. 7D, Additional file 1: Fig. S9B). Given the pivotal role of Mef2c in smooth muscle differentiation [53], the increased expression of Acta2 in HU-CA and HU-FA might be attributed to the enhanced activity of Mef2c. Zeb1, which is involved in epithelial–mesenchymal transition and plays a protective role in the process of atherosclerosis [56], had elevated activities in SMC of HU-CA (Fig. 7D). Atf4, recognized for its role in angiogenic activation and its ability to heterodimerize with other TFs such as Cebpb and Jund [57], and AP-1 family member Jun and Fos, exhibited greater activity in HU-FA and HU-CA compared to Con groups in EC. Meanwhile, the atheroprotective Klf4 demonstrated heightened activity in ECs of HU-FA but not HU-CA (Fig. 7E, Additional file 1: Fig. S9C). Additionally, we constructed the TF-target gene network of some TFs and noticed that Jun, Fosb and Mef2c shared some target genes. Acta2 is related to Srf and Ets1 according to this network (Fig. 7F), which has enlightening effects on studying the mechanism of Acta2 upregulation in several cell types.Discussion Weightless environment has a wide range of physiological effects on blood vessels. Here, we present a comprehensive CA and FA cell atlas in rats subjected to hindlimb suspension by utilizing scRNA-seq. We observed hindlimb unloading-associated alterations in cell type composition. Cell type-specific and artery type-specific transcriptomic changes were presented. The heterogeneous sub-clusters of the major cell types were then identified. In addition, cellular communication and TF prediction in FA and CA of rats under hindlimb unweighting was described. Our study will collectively provide insights into the mechanisms underlying arterial remodeling in microgravity conditions. The most frequently reported duration for rat tail suspension is 28 days. However, as human spaceflight missions become increasingly prolonged, it is imperative to observe the physiological effects of long-term weightlessness on biological organisms. Consequently, we have extended the duration of rat tail suspension to three months. Using scRNA-sequencing method, we delineated 23 distinct cell clusters, representing the predominant cell types within the CA and FA. A comparative analysis between the HU and Con groups revealed a notable decrease in the proportion of SMCs in both the CA and FA after tail suspension. This observation contradicts earlier studies [5], possibly due to variations in the duration of hindlimb suspension, as vascular remodeling is an ongoing and dynamic process. Furthermore, an elevated proportion of immune cells in the HU-FA suggests heightened inflammation in the femoral arteries of rats subjected to weightlessness. Considering dysregulated genes may be highly specific for different vascular cell types, we provide transcriptomic changes of four major arterial cell types (SMCs, ECs, fibroblasts and macrophages). Notably, fibroblasts from both the CA and FA showed the most significant upregulation and downregulation of genes. This finding underscored their high plasticity and crucial role in vascular remodeling in hindlimb-unloaded rats. The adventitial fibroblast’s role in vascular remodeling is increasingly recognized [58, 59]. However, knowledge about vascular fibroblasts from rats exposed to hindlimb suspension is lacking. ScRNA-seq offers an opportunity to detect gene expression of vascular fibroblasts from HU-CA and HU-FA. The upregulation of Serpine1 and Serpine2 suggested impaired matrix degradation in CA and FA after microgravity. Additionally, the heightened expression of Txnip indicated the elevated oxidative stress and inflammatory state of fibroblasts in HU-CA and HU-FA. Metabolic processes in adventitial fibroblasts were also found to be altered post-hindlimb unloading in the CA and FA, emphasizing the importance of fibroblast metabolic changes in vascular remodeling. This result was consistent with a previous study that highlighted the significant role of metabolic changes in adventitial fibroblasts in the vascular remodeling of pulmonary arterial hypertension in pulmonary hypertension [60]. Considering the distinct hemodynamics between the upper and lower body, we hypothesized differential gene expression in the FA and CA. Our findings confirmed this, with the CA and FA showing some divergent changes. For instance, genes involved in ribosome subunits were upregulated in HU-CA SMCs but downregulated in HU-FA SMCs compared to controls. However, we also found some similarities in arterial changes between CA and FA, suggesting that there may be other factors contributing to arterial remodeling in addition to headward fluid shift under microgravity. Notably, the expression of Acta2, which encodes α-SMA, was enhanced in SMCs of both HU-CA and HU-FA. This, coupled with the reduced proportion of SMCs in the CA and FA, helps us understand the mechanism behind the intima-media thickening in HU-CA. We speculate that the elevated Acta2 expression may predominantly contribute to intima-media thickening in the CA, while the decreased SMC fraction in HU-FA could counteract the increased Acta2 expression. Moreover, the upregulation of inflammation-related TFs (Klf4, Fos, Jun, Cebpb) across several cell types, the upregulation of Cxcr4 in HU-CA and HU-FA macrophages, and heightened Txnip expression in fibroblasts collectively suggest a possible inflammatory state in the circulatory system of hindlimb-unweighted rats. This study reports for the first time the high levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in the upper and lower body blood vessels under simulated weightlessness. This finding was consistent to previous research showing an inflammatory response in the CA of rats subjected to hindlimb unloading [61]. Similarly, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation have been found elevated in astronauts following long-duration spaceflight [62]. Additionally, the downregulation of these genes associated with elastic fibers (Eln), collagens (Col1a1, Col3a1), and other ECM components (Lox, Sparc) in the CA and FA of hindlimb-unweighted rats may partially explain the observed decrease in vascular distensibility and the increased vascular stiffness reported previously [2]. Adding another layer of complexity to vascular remodeling in simulated microgravity, heterogeneous cell types exhibited specific features. ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts were extracted from total cells and divided into several sub-populations, respectively. Our study revealed two EndoMT-related EC sub-clusters which were in the process of differentiation into SMCs and fibroblasts. Notably, only EC sub-cluster 4 from HU-CA was in the process of differentiation into SMCs. This finding was evidenced by the pseudotime analysis. EndoMT is a kind of phenotypic switch through which ECs gain mesenchymal-like properties, resulting in enhanced migration and endothelial dysfunction. Inducers of EndoMT include biochemical and biomechanical stimuli [63]. We postulate that elevated transmural pressure in the CA of rats subjected to tail suspension could be a contributing factor. Another possibility is that increased expression of Serpine1 in fibroblasts mediated EndoMT as previously reported [64]. Endothelial impairment was reported during and after spaceflight [65]. The finding of EndoMT in this study may provide new insight of endothelial impairment. Moreover, we found a sub-cluster of SMCs responsible for DNA replication and mitosis, indicating the highly proliferative activity of this sub-cluster of SMCs. As adjacent component of blood vessels, ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts can communicate with each other through direct contact, paracrine and extracellular vesicles [66]. The communication between ECs and VSMCs has been studied intensively. Here we first reported that the number of significantly enriched ligand-receptor pairs between SMCs and fibroblasts was more than that between other cell types in HU-CA and HU-FA. Some studies have found that SMCs interact with fibroblasts in pathological conditions through extracellular vesicles [36, 67], highlighting the important role of cellular communication between SMCs and fibroblasts in artery remodeling process. This was also demonstrated in our study. Transcription factor network analysis unraveled the high activity of Fos, Jun, Cebpb in ECs and fibroblasts, indicating the hyperinflammatory state in CA and FA. This finding further suggests the important role of AP-1 family members and CEBPs in vascular remodeling in rats under simulated microgravity. Limitations of the study lie in the following aspects. First, most of the descriptive results in our study lack proof of protein level although some are verified using immunofluorescent staining. Second, the relatively small number of some cell types such as T and B immune cells and stem cells limits the research of genetic changes in response to simulated microgravity. Third, our study’s primary focus was on conduit arteries, namely the CA and FA. The impact of modeled microgravity on microcirculatory changes merits further exploration in future studies.Conclusions Comprehensive single-cell compendium of the vascular remodeling process in rats at the molecular level under simulated microgravity is described in our study. The identification of region-specific and artery-specific transcriptomic changes, along with commonalities between the CA and FA, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the vascular remodeling process under microgravity conditions. By focusing on the less-explored fibroblasts and immune cells, as well as the sub-clusters within the major arterial cell types, our research sheds light on the intricate biological processes at play under simulated microgravity.Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

The purpose of this review is to describe current understanding of microgravity and radiation impacts on the mammalian skeleton and associated vasculature at the level of the whole organism. Recent experiments from spaceflight and ground-based models have provided fresh insights into how these environmental stresses influence mechanisms that are related to redox signaling, oxidative stress, and tissue dysfunction. Emerging mechanistic knowledge on cellular defenses to radiation and other environmental stressors, including microgravity, are useful for both screening and developing interventions against spaceflight-induced deficits in bone and vascular function. Keywords: spaceflight, bone, vasculature, oxidative stress, microgravity, hindlimb unloading, radiation, reactive oxygen species, antioxidant1. The Spaceflight Environment and Its Impact on Skeletal and Vascular Health Microgravity and radiation are two unique elements of the spaceflight environment that pose challenges to the health of an organism. Microgravity leads to a cephalad fluid shift and profound reductions in mechanical loading of bone and muscle. Spaceflight causes perturbations in calcium homeostasis and site-specific reductions in bone mass (osteopenia), and thus may pose long-term risks for skeletal health and tissue repair [1,2,3,4]. In rodent models of weightlessness such as hindlimb unloading (HU), the onset of osteopenia correlates with reductions in skeletal perfusion, vascular density (rarefication), and vasodilation responses similar to that observed in aging [5,6,7]. These are serious risks for long-duration, exploration-class missions when astronauts will face the challenges of increased exposure to space radiation and abrupt transitions between different gravitational states upon return to Earth. Beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere, astronauts will be exposed to a complex combination of ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and intermittent solar particle events (SPEs). GCR is comprised of α particles, protons and a small percentage of high-charge and high-energy (HZE) nuclei while SPEs generate highly energetic protons and heavy ions. HZE particles are of particular concern during exploration-class missions [8] (reviewed in [9]). HZE easily penetrate spacecraft shielding and biological tissue, deposit very large amounts of energy along linear tracks (high linear energy transfer, high LET) that cause DNA strand breakage, and generate secondary radiations that may have additional detrimental biological effects [10,11,12,13,14]. Other responses to ionizing radiation include oxidative stress, damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA, adversely affecting functions of membranes, the extracellular matrix, cell cycle and survival [15,16,17].2.

Evidence from Spaceflight Spaceflight and the return to Earth may lead to oxidative damage in blood and various tissues as a result of excessive reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) in both humans and animals [18,19,20,21,22,23]. Collectively, a number of studies indicate that various tissues undergo altered redox status during and/or after spaceflight. Urinary excretion of the oxidative damage markers, 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured in-flight (88 to 186 days in orbit) and post-flight (up to 14 days) in Mir mission crew [19]. The isoprostane, 8-iso-PGF2α, is a marker for oxidative damage to membrane lipids and is produced by the peroxidation of arachidonic acid in membrane phospholipids while 8-OHdG is an oxidized derivative of the nucleoside, deoxyguanosine, and is therefore used to assess oxidative damage to DNA. 8-OHdG excretion was unchanged during spaceflight and increased postflight. No changes in 8-OHdG levels were observed in Earth-based individuals that underwent bed rest although isoprostane was increased in the ensuing recovery period. Changes in isoprostane production were attributed to decreased generation of oxygen radicals from the electron transport chain due to reduced caloric intake in-flight, whereas the post-flight increases in the excretion of oxidative damage markers may be partly caused by a combination of increased metabolic activity following flight and the loss of some antioxidant defenses during flight. The downregulation of antioxidant defenses as a potential mechanism for the increased levels of oxidative damage post-flight is supported by the observation that hair follicle samples from International Space Station (ISS) crew members at post-flight display decreased expression of endogenous antioxidant genes, including Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), CuZnSOD, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), the regulator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2 a.k.a. NRF2), a master transcription factor that regulates hundreds of oxidative defense-related genes [24]. Consistent with the findings in spaceflight crew members, rodents subjected to spaceflight also exhibit alterations in redox signaling relative to ground controls. In rats, short-duration spaceflight (6 days) increases cardiac gene expression of mitochondrial redox-related enzymes [25], suggesting a possible stress response and/or change in energy metabolism. Although short duration spaceflight (7 days) does not alter heart mass in rats [26], differences between flight and ground controls were observed in the vasculature of mice [27,28]. Spaceflight induces similar effects in the liver of both rats and mice, which includes elevated expression levels of antioxidant genes and markers of oxidative damage [18,29]. Male rats flown in STS-63 for eight days showed reduced total glutathione (GSH) content and activities of CuZnSOD (SOD1), catalase, GSH reductase, and GSH sulfur-transferase in liver [18]. In ocular tissue, astronauts are susceptible to optic disc edema, globe flattening, and choroidal fold formation [30]. The mechanisms are unknown, although mice flown in STS-135 also showed ocular tissue damage as well as alterations in several critical genes involved in regulating vascular endothelial cell response to oxidative stress and apoptosis [31].2.1.2. Evidence from Ground-Based Models for Spaceflight Ground-based simulations of microgravity and space radiation also demonstrate a link between oxidative stress and tissue impairments. Rodents exposed to proton (50 cGy) or 56Fe (15 cGy) display increased oxidative damage in the heart and decrements in clinical measures of cardiac function [32] while γ-radiation exposure (137Cs, 1–2 Gy) increases ROS generation and lipid peroxidation in bone marrow, and decreases cancellous bone volume fraction [33]. Furthermore, bone marrow from rodents exposed to radiation display increased expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), and the pro-osteoclastogenic signal, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), as well as upregulation of NRF2 [34,35]. Hindlimb unloading (HU) is a widely accepted rodent model to simulate weightlessness for many different tissues (reviewed in [36,37,38]). Marrow cells of the osteoblast lineage from HU mice show elevated ROS within a week of HU [39]. Marrow and bone show parallel increases in gene expression of the cytosolic fraction of the free radical scavenger, superoxide dismutase (SOD), changes that coincide with HU-induced reductions in osteoblast activity and bone loss [39]. HU also causes adaptation-related changes in cardiovascular function [40,41,42,43,44], and several studies have linked HU-induced vascular responses and oxidative stress [45,46,47]. Taken together, observations from both spaceflight and ground-based rodent models that simulate weightlessness show that oxidative stress and damage may occur in response to microgravity and radiation across multiple, if not all, tissues.3. The Role of Nitric Oxide (NO) and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Signaling in Skeletal and Vascular Disease 3.1. NO and ROS Signaling: Mechanisms and Impact on Tissue Function Excess reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and inflammation are implicated both in age-related diseases, such as osteoporosis and atherosclerosis, and following insults such as radiation exposure [15]. ROS can directly stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts [48,49], and the bone loss due to aging and estrogen deficiency may be partly attributed to oxidative stress [50,51]. Furthermore, treatment with the potent antioxidant, α-lipoic acid, can prevent inflammation- and acute radiation-induced bone loss [33,52]. Oxidative damage from the production of excess ROS/RNS in skeletal tissues during spaceflight may lead to delayed deficits in bone structural integrity and reduced mechanical strength during recovery and the aging process. Under physiological conditions, ROS and RNS such as nitric oxide (NO) can function as signaling molecules to regulate important processes such as mechanotransduction [53,54,55,56,57,58,59] and vascular function [60]. However, at high levels, ROS are potent inducers of apoptosis in response to a vast array of cellular insults [61,62]. Superoxide (O2−) in particular is cytotoxic and is produced when molecular oxygen reacts with an aqueous electron. O2− can be generated by exposure of cells to ionizing irradiation and as a by-product of metabolism, primarily from mitochondria. O2− is an upstream component of many oxidative pathways and can be rapidly converted into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by members of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) family of antioxidants [63,64]. Catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and other peroxidases such as peroxiredoxin then convert H2O2 into H2O [65]. H2O2 can react with endogenous Fe2+ or other transition metals via a fenton mechanism to generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH•) [66] which is one of the most damaging free radical species produced by exposure to ionizing radiation [67]. Normal vascular function requires both basal and stimulated production of NO in the endothelium by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The eNOS enzyme utilizes l-arginine to produce NO and l-citrulline. NO then activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by binding to it. This leads to increased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) which in turn mediates vascular smooth muscle relaxation [68]. Genetic ablation studies of eNOS in rodents demonstrate the critical role of endothelial NO signaling in vascular health [69]. eNOS knockout (KO) mice lack endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) activity in response to endothelium-dependent vasodilators (e.g., acetylcholine) [70,71]. Furthermore, they are hypertensive [71], display increased vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [72], and platelet aggregation [73], as well as a higher predisposition to atherosclerosis [74], thrombosis [75], and stroke [69,76,77]. The activity of eNOS is regulated via complex and concerted processes, including transcriptional control, substrate availability, interactions with other proteins and co-factors and post-translational modification [69]. Under conditions of oxidative stress, the biological activity of NO may decline in resistance arteries. For example, in the presence of O2−, NO rapidly combines to form peroxynitrite. SOD neutralizes O2− by converting it to H2O2, thus preventing its reaction with NO and increasing the half-life and bioavailability of NO [64,78]. The generation of excess ROS is thought to be of one of the primary mechanisms by which ionizing radiation causes tissue damage. Dr. M. Delp [79] and others propose a model wherein microgravity and radiation promote the generation of ROS in the resistance vasculature of bone that creates an imbalance favoring peroxynitrite over NO production. This lowers the bioavailability of NO, diminishes endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and disrupts the coupling of bone circulation with bone remodeling. While more studies are required to test the validity of this model, results from our group and others, as described in the succeeding sections, appear to be consistent with such a model.3.2. Bone and Vascular Function during Development Are Intimately Associated Vasculature is critical for normal skeletal development, postnatal growth, remodeling, and fracture repair. The embryonic skeleton undergoes endochondral ossification (reviewed in [80,81]) where cartilage, an avascular tissue, is gradually converted into bone, one of the most vascularized tissues in vertebrates [80]. This process occurs through a series of complex and coordinated signals that induce terminal differentiation of chondrocytes and their subsequent death. The extracellular matrix produced by the chondrocytes is then mineralized and partly degraded by chondroclasts and preosteoclasts, thus promoting the invasion of blood vessels. Following vascular invasion, osteogenic progenitors are recruited to the site, where they form mineralized bone [81]. A similar mechanism occurs during postnatal growth of the long bones, fracture repair and bone remodeling, although smaller in scale than what occurs during development. There is evidence that re-vascularization in response to bone injury is impaired in spaceflight. Rats that underwent osteotomy and then exposed to microgravity display reduced angiogenesis at the site of injury [82]. Since proper repair of skeletal tissue requires competent vascular invasion, this raises concerns of a higher risk for impaired fracture healing in individuals as a consequence of spaceflight. The coupling of vascular perfusion and skeletal function has been demonstrated in a number of studies [83,84,85]. In addition, administration of anti-osteoporotic bisphosphonates improved blood flow and angiogenesis in aged rodents [86] while endochondral bone formation and angiogenesis are impaired in mice lacking certain isoforms of the pro-angiogenic signal, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [87]. Increased VEGF levels from over-expression of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFα) promotes both angiogenesis and osteogenesis, while loss of HIF1a in osteoblasts resulted in thinner and less vascularized bones [88].3.3. Vascular-Bone Coupling Occurs via Redox-Dependent Mechanisms: Implications for Tissue Responses to Spaceflight Cardiovascular deconditioning is one of the potential health risks associated with spaceflight [89,90]. A majority of astronauts experience orthostatic intolerance upon return from long-duration flight (129–190 days) [89,91,92,93] which is attributed to impairments in raising peripheral resistance [79]. Muscle vasculature plays an integral role in elevating peripheral resistance and, therefore, has been the subject of a number of studies using spaceflight models. In rodents, both spaceflight and hindlimb unloading impair vasoconstriction of gastrocnemius resistance arteries [94,95]. In addition, resistance arteries of mouse gastrocnemius [96] and rat soleus [97] both display defects in endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In rats, the soleus resistance arteries exhibit diminished expression levels of eNOS and SOD1, although the gastrocnemius resistance arteries do not show such alterations [97,98]. The basis for the site-specific differences in redox status of vascular resistance arteries is not fully understood. However, there is speculation that this is partly due to region-specific differences in perfusion and/or differences in metabolic rates of slow versus fast twitch muscle fibers and the relative abundance of these fiber types in the two muscle sites. Similar to the observations in muscle resistance arteries, the vasculature of bone also exhibits functional impairments under spaceflight conditions. Two weeks of HU in rats results in deficits in vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA) [99], the primary route for blood circulation to the femur. HU animals display decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and increases in vascular resistance. These changes are not attributed to enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries, but are associated with decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilation and vascular remodeling that reduces PNA maximal diameter. The skeleton, like muscle, undergoes deconditioning during spaceflight (and its analogs) which manifests as a reduction in bone mass due to a transient net increase in resorption [100,101,102] as well as diminished mechanical strength [4]. These coincide with functional impairments and changes in redox status in associated vasculature [93]. Greater decrements in percent cancellous bone volume were observed after 13 to 16 days of HU and exposure to simulated space radiation when treatments were combined, compared to untreated controls. HU reduced trabecular thickness, whereas irradiation reduced trabecular number but not thickness, accounting for the sometimes greater deficit in percent cancellous bone volume when HU and radiation are combined. In the gastrocnemius feed artery, which served as a surrogate artery for the PNA, the early effects of HU and IR (56Fe) are to each impair peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation, with the combination of HU and IR exacerbating this deficit. These group differences are abolished in the presence of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, indicating that the impairment induced by HU and IR was mediated through the NOS signaling pathway. Vasodilation response to the NO donor DEA-NONOate is also impaired by HU and IR, indicating that the depressed endothelium-dependent vasodilation could be mediated in part through a reduced smooth muscle responsiveness to NO. Further, peak vasodilation correlates positively with percent cancellous bone volume which suggests a coupling of bone and vasculature responses to stressors associated with spaceflight. In contrast to vasodilator responses, HU and IR as single treatments or combined have little effect on vasoconstrictor properties or pressure-diameter responses. HU and HU with IR results in decreased levels of eNOS protein, while IR and HU with IR leads to diminished superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) and higher xanthine oxidase (XO) protein content. Decrements in the bioavailability of NO via reduction in eNOS protein levels, lower anti-oxidant capacity (SOD1) and higher pro-oxidant capacity (XO) may contribute to the deficits in NOS signaling in resistance arteries. When the vascular effects of long-term (6–7 months) recovery from HU, IR (56Fe), and the combination of HU and IR are examined, only IR sustains an impairment in peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation [103]. The IR-induced deficit in endothelial vasodilator function is abolished by chemical inhibition of NOS, indicating that the sustained dysfunction is mediated through the NOS signaling pathway. Similar to the findings from an early timepoint (two weeks of HU with or without IR) [93], HU and IR have little effect on vasoconstrictor properties. These findings indicate that although both simulated weightlessness and irradiation produce early effects of impaired vascular endothelial function, only those produced by IR are sustained. IR and HU causes differential effects on loss and thinning of trabeculae, contributing to lower percent cancellous bone volume when the treatments were combined. Both treatments impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation of skeletal muscle resistance arteries via a NO-dependent signaling pathway. The impairment of NOS signaling, however, seems to be differentially affected by unloading and irradiation; HU diminishes vascular eNOS protein expression whereas IR reduces SOD expression and increases pro-oxidant XO protein levels. If these findings in skeletal muscle resistance arteries hold for bone vasculature, impairments in endothelium-dependent vasodilation may lead to reductions in skeletal perfusion and perturbations in the coupling of bone cell and vascular endothelium activity.3.4. Cellular Defenses to Oxidative Damage Are Important for Preserving Skeletal and Vascular Health Most aerobic organisms have multiple defenses against the damaging effects of ROS, which include enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Studies on perturbation of key antioxidant molecules and signaling pathways highlight the importance of antioxidant defenses in preserving the functional integrity of tissues and cells. In the following section, we summarize the state of knowledge on the role of endogenous antioxidant proteins in maintaining skeletal and vascular health with an emphasis on studies using genetic models of gain or loss of protein function. The cytoprotective effect of these proteins on Earth has, therefore, formed the rationale for investigating their importance in tissue and cellular defenses against the stressors associated with spaceflight [18,24] and its Earth-based analogs [34,35]. In this section, we also cite studies that illustrate the emerging role of these antioxidant proteins in modulating skeletal and vascular responses to spaceflight. 3.4.1. Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2) NRF2 is a master transcription factor that regulates cellular redox balance and protective antioxidant and detoxification responses across multiple species, from Drosophila to humans [104,105,106]. It is a member of the Cap-N-Collar family of regulatory proteins composed of NRF1, NRF3 and BACH1 and BACH2 [106] and is ubiquitously expressed with the highest concentrations occuring in heart, muscle and brain [107]. Under normal conditions, NRF2 is sequestered to the cytosol via binding to its inhibitor, KEAP1, and is therefore subject to proteosomal degradation. During conditions of excess ROS, NRF2 dissociates from KEAP1 and undergoes translocation into the nucleus. NRF2 then binds to antioxidant response-element sequences in the genome to promote transcription of hundreds of antioxidant genes [108] including SOD1 as well as phase II detoxification enzymes [106]. In Drosophila, loss-of-function mutations in dKEAP1, an endogenous inhibitor of the NRF2 fly homolog CncC, extends lifespan and increases resistance to the oxidizer paraquat [104]. Mice in which NRF2 is globally deleted are viable, fertile and exhibit no apparent phenotypic defects [109,110]. However, consistent with its cytoprotective function, NRF2 deletion in mice leads to increased sensitivity to radiation, oxidative damage and age-related disease pathologies [105,111]. Specifically, NRF2 knockouts display accelerated heart failure in a myocardial infarct model [112], enhanced retinal degeneration [113,114], bone loss [110,115,116], and deficits in bone and endothelial stem and progenitor cell populations [115,117]. A number of studies have characterized the skeletal phenotype of NRF2 knockouts and show that the effects of NRF2 appear to be sex- and age-dependent. Cultured osteoclasts from NRF2 knockout mice display elevated ROS levels, increased maturation and defective production of antioxidant enzymes. On the other hand, pre-treatment with NRF2 agonists sulforaphane and curcumin, inhibit osteoclast maturation via activation of NRF2 [118]. In female rodents, NRF2 deletion results in decrements in percent cancellous bone volume and trabecular number as well as increased trabecular separation, which persists up to eight months of age but are no longer apparent thereafter. In addition, primary cultures of bone marrow-derived stromal cells from these KOs show diminished colony formation with no differences in osteoblast proliferation in vivo. Similarly, ex vivo osteoclast cultures from NRF2 KOs mature faster than those from wild-type animals, although in vivo osteoclast counts are unchanged [115]. In contrast, NRF2 deletion in male rodents leads to higher bone mass, mineral apposition rate and osteoblast number compared to wild-type controls [119]. These sex-dependent differences were corroborated in a more rigorous study comparing male and female NRF2 KOs [110]. NRF2 deficiency in females results in reduced femoral and spinal bone mineral density, while loss of NRF2 in males leads to an improvement in the said bone structural parameters compared to sex-matched controls. Furthermore, both young (3-month old) and old (15-month old) KO females display decreased expression of NRF2 target antioxidant enzymes; in contrast, these deficits are only observed in aging males [110]. Collectively, the abovementioned studies demonstrate that NRF2 plays a critical role in maintaining the functional and structural integrity of bone and vasculature here on Earth, and that loss of the NRF2 gene mimics some of the features of spaceflight-induced bone loss. However, how NRF2 impacts tissue responses to elements of the space environment (radiation or microgravity) or its analogs is less clear. One study determined the consequence of NRF2 loss in a rodent radiotherapy model at high doses (20 Gy) of ionizing radiation [116] where it was found that NRF2 ablation exacerbates bone loss and impairs colony-forming capacity of bone marrow-derived progenitors [116]. Likewise, the role of NRF2 in tissue responses to microgravity has not been thoroughly examined, although there is some evidence of its function in mechanical load-driven bone formation. NRF2 KOs are less responsive to the anabolic effects of mechanical loading of the ulna compared to wild-type controls, as indicated by blunted bone formation rate and decreased relative mineralizing surface. In addition, cultured primary osteoblasts from mechanically loaded ulna of NRF2 KOs display reductions in the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes [120]. Microgravity causes a cephalad fluid shift [121] as well as changes in ion homeostasis [122,123,124] and there is indirect evidence that NRF2 may play a role in the endothelial response to perturbations in ionic balance. NRF2 KO and wild-type controls were fed either a low or high salt diet and vascular function was analyzed. Endothelium-dependent dilation to acetylcholine is unchanged in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) in both groups fed a low-salt diet. High-salt diet eliminates endothelium-dependent dilation to acetylcholine in both genotypes. However, unlike wild-type controls, NRF2 KO rats fail to respond to the rescuing effects of angiotensin II infusion on high-salt diet-induced endothelial dysfunction and microvessel rarefication [125].3.4.2. CuZn Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) SOD1 gene expression is downregulated in hair follicles of spacefight crew members [24] while its protein levels are decreased in livers of spaceflown rats [18] although its role in protecting vasculature and bone from spaceflight stressors needs to be further elucidated. SODs are the major antioxidant defense systems against O2−, catalyzing the conversion of O2− to H2O2, which is then further reduced to water by catalase, peroxiredoxins (PRx), or glutathione peroxidases (GPX) [64]. In mammals, the SOD family is comprised of three isoforms: cytoplasmic CuZnSOD (SOD1), mitochondrial MnSOD (SOD2), and the extracellular CuZnSOD (SOD3), and as their names indicate, require a metal co-factor (Cu, Mn, or Zn) for their activation. Both male and female SOD1 knockout mice exhibit increased oxidative stress, and decreased bone mineral density and mechanical strength (bending stiffness) as assessed by three-point bending compared to sex-matched wild type controls [126]. Consistent with the observations in bone, SOD1 deletion also leads to increased oxidative damage in skeletal muscle, accelerates age-dependent skeletal muscle atrophy and motor function deficits as assessed by voluntary wheel running and rotating rod test [127]. Similar to results from deletion of its transcriptional regulator NRF2, loss of the SOD1 gene leads to musculoskeletal deficits, also resembling some of tissue deficits observed in spaceflight and its Earth-based analogs.3.4.3. Catalase Catalase is an anti-oxidant that converts the reactive species, H2O2, into water and molecular oxygen. Transgenic mice over-expressing the human catalase (hCAT) gene targeted to the mitochondria (mCAT mice) display extended lifespan [128] and reductions in numerous pathologies [129,130,131] including cardiovascular disease [131,132,133] and Alzheimer-related amyloid deposition [130]. Further, the transgene effectively quenches mitochondrial oxidative stress in macrophages which are precursors to bone-resorbing osteoclasts [134]. Consistent with the latter finding, over-expression of catalase targeted to mitochondria of bone-resorbing osteoclasts protects from bone loss caused by the loss of estrogens [135]. In addition, the transgene rescues cardiomyopathy including impaired systolic and diastolic function in mice that carry homozygous mutations in the exonuclease encoding domain of mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (Polg(m/m)) [131]. Catalase protein levels and activity are decreased in livers of spaceflown rats [18]. Furthermore, a number of studies involving the mitochondrial hCAT transgene demonstrate the importance of mitochondrial ROS quenching in the cellular defense against HZE particles. mCAT animals display protection from proton-induced deficits in synaptic signaling, dendritic complexity, memory and cognition [136,137,138]. The impact of mitochondrial ROS quenching on skeletal and cardiovascular responses to microgravity and radiation is less understood and is currently under investigation by our team and others.4. Implications for the Development of Spaceflight Countermeasures Whole body irradiation increases ROS generation by bone marrow cells [33,139], damages skeletal lipids [33], and upregulates the activity of the antioxidant enzyme NRF2 in both bone marrow and mineralized tissue [35,140]. On the other hand, NRF2 deficiency can exacerbate radiation-induced bone loss [116]. Collectively, these data suggest that pharmacologic interventions directed toward limiting excess ROS may moderate the radiation stress response of bone cells. Within a period of three days to a month, relatively low doses of radiation (≤2 Gy) lead to progressive loss of cancellous bone, as shown by our group and others [34,35,141,142,143,144], which is preceeded by a rapid increase in expression levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL1 and TNFα and pro-osteoclastogenic signals RANKL and MCP1 as well as the oxidative defense gene, NRF2 [34,35]. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that diets or drugs capable of preventing early increases in these molecular signals can mitigate cancellous bone loss caused by both low LET and high LET radiation. The hypothesis was tested by evaluating a number of candidate interventions including: (1) an antioxidant diet cocktail (AOX) composed of N-acetyl cysteine, ascorbic acid, l-selenomethionine, dihydrolipoic acid and vitamin E which in combination has been shown to protect a variety of tissues from ionizing radiation [145,146,147]; (2) dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), which possesses antioxidant properties [148,149]; (3) the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, Ibuprofen [150,151]; and (4) Dried Plum (DP, 25% by weight), previously reported to inhibit osteoclast activity and protect from age-related bone loss [152,153,154,155]. Findings from this study indicate that high levels of pro-resorptive, pro-inflammatory, and oxidative stress-related genes in bone marrow strongly correlate with cancellous bone loss. DP diet completely prevents radiation-induced increases in these molecular signals and the ensuing cancellous bone loss [35] which appears to strengthen the rationale for using antioxidants to mitigate radiation-induced bone loss. However, seemingly paradoxical is that the other two antioxidant-based interventions, DHLA and AOX, failed to protect from bone loss induced by radiation. These findings do not nullify the feasibility of using antioxidants as a countermeasure, yet highlight very important considerations in countermeasure design for radiation-induced bone loss. Firstly, an effective strategy to mitigate radiation-induced bone loss must at least include components that prevent the early rise in expression of pro-resorptive, pro-inflammatory, and oxidative stress-related genes. This knowledge is gained from the observation that treatments which fail to mitigate the changes in all these three molecular signals (such as AOX and Ibuprofen) ultimately were unsuccessful in preventing radiation-induced bone loss. Secondly, there are additional, equally important signaling molecules likely to mediate radiation-induced bone loss. This is a lesson learned from the finding that DHLA, which appeared nearly as effective as DP in preventing radiation-induced increases in expression of these markers, did not protect skeletal microarchitecture. Lastly, an assessment of the efficacy of an intervention on multiple organ systems must be incorporated in countermeasure development efforts as antioxidants appear to confer various levels of protection in different tissues.5. Concluding Statements Studies overwhelmingly demonstrate a link between oxidative damage and tissue dysfunction that ensues from exposure to spaceflight factors (Figure 1). One of the outstanding questions that needs to be addressed is whether oxidative damage mediates or results from progressive tissue degeneration in the course of spaceflight [156]. More studies using genetic models for altered redox status will contribute to resolving this question. Future interplanetary travel will increase the duration of exposure of humans to spaceflight. Therefore, additional comprehensive investigations involving extended timepoints that simulate the duration of long-term missions and the ensuing recovery must be conducted to better estimate health risks to crew. Furthermore, the latent effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system and on stem and progenitor cells of the bone marrow must be examined for their potential to exacerbate the effects of aging. The use of antioxidant-based countermeasures must be guided by the understanding that low levels of ROS signaling are important for normal cellular function. Therefore, future studies must also assess the potential of any antioxidant-based countermeasure to perturb these essential signaling events and their consequences on the functional integrity of tissues. Research progress on the aformentioned areas will help in the development of effective approaches for maintaining crew health during and after interplanetary missions. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Hypothetical model on how spaceflight leads to deficits in tissue function and structural integrity. Exposure of tissues to elements of the spaceflight environment such as microgravity and radiation (and potentially other unknown factors) leads to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (NOS), increased levels of pro-inflammatory signals, and downregulation of endogenous antioxidant defenses. This leads to excess ROS/NOS due to an imbalance between endogenous antioxidant protein levels and ROS/NOS production. Excess ROS/NOS leads to oxidative damage of proteins, lipids and DNA which in turn result in deficits in tissue function and structural integrity. Other non-redox signaling processes may also contribute to these deficits. Some exogenous antioxidants found in the diet may block the increases in ROS/NOS levels and inflammatory signals, thereby preventing oxidative damage. It remains to be elucidated whether inflammation causes ROS production and/or vice versa in the context of spaceflight, and whether oxidative damage mediates or results from progressive tissue degeneration as a consequence of spaceflight. T-bar arrow: inhibitory effect; dotted line arrow: cause and effect needs further elucidation. Gray arrows depict the contribution of non-redox related processes in spaceflight-induced deficits in tissue structure and function.Acknowledgments We express gratitude to our valued collaborators, Michael Delp (Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA) and Charles Limoli (University of California, Irvine, CA, USA), as well as Joshua Alwood, Ann-Sofie Schreurs, Yasaman Shirazi-Fard, Mohammed Shahnazari and the many other motivated postdoctoral scholars and students in the Bone and Signaling Lab who performed some of the research described in this review.
