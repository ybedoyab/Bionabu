    "abstract": "Abstract Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity. Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1g. A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities.

    "introduction": "Introduction Plant tropisms are growth-mediated movements relative to the direction of an external stimulus. In early studies, these movements were first characterized by Darwin and Darwin (1880), however, description of plant movement actually dates back to the Ancient Romans (Ovid 8 AD 2008). Plants exhibit these growth-mediated responses to external cues, including water (hydrotropism, Kiss 2007), touch or contact (thigmotropism, Braam 2005), the sun or light (heliotropism and phototropism, respectively Briggs 1964; Vandenbrink et al. 2014a, b; Kutschera and Briggs 2016), and gravity (gravitropism, Chen et al. 1999; Kiss 2000) among others. Tropisms are important for plants, which as sessile organisms, utilize these movements to respond to external stimuli (Kaufman et al. 1987; Whippo and Hangarter 2004). Typically, in ground studies, plants respond to blue-light photostimulation positively (growth towards the light) in shoots, and negatively (growth away from the light source) in roots (Kutschera and Briggs 2012; Briggs 2014; Liscum et al. 2014). Recently, a positive red-light-based phototropic response in roots mediated by phytochromes has been observed and characterized (Kiss et al. 2003; Molas and Kiss 2008), in addition to positive hypocotyl phototropic response to red light in the conditions of microgravity (Millar et al. 2010). However, the magnitude of phototropic response is less during red-light stimulation compared with the robust response to blue light. In terms of gravitropic response, in general, plants respond to the gravity vector by growing roots in the direction of gravity, and shoots opposite of the gravity vector. The amalgamation of tropistic movements results in the overall direction and form of plant growth (Correll and Kiss 2002). Plants utilize both gravity and light cues to direct plant growth and development. In addition to directing root growth towards the gravity vector, sunlight can penetrate the soil up to several millimeters beneath the soil surface, having a direct effect on the growth and development of roots (Woolley and Stoller 1978; Tester and Morris 1987). The red and far-red part of the light spectrum can penetrate to greater depths than blue light (Mandoli and Briggs 1984) which has led to plants evolving blue-light receptors located near the upper portion of roots and red-light receptors near the apices due to this pattern of light penetration (Mo et al. 2015). In addition, it has been shown that plants utilize blue-light cues to control root architectural features, such as lateral root growth (Moni et al. 2015). Light perception by the roots may also impact plant growth and development elsewhere, as light signals sensed by root apices have also been shown to have an effect on shoot gravitropic response (Hopkins and Kiss 2012). Taken together, these observations suggest that light perception within the root plays a dynamic role in plant development. Specifically, an effect of light irradiation on shortening the root length has been reported (Silva-Navas et al. 2015), although other works have shown higher rates of root elongation under light-grown conditions (Laxmi et al. 2008). Modulation of cell-cycle progression by photoreceptors in meristems is well known, but there are data indicating that this action of light is different in the root and in the shoot meristems (López-Juez et al. 2008; Silva-Navas et al. 2015). To perceive light stimuli, plants contain specialized photoreceptor proteins specific to red, blue, and UV-B light. Plants sense blue light via two types of light receptors: cryptochromes and phototropins. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, PHOT1 and PHOT2 (Christie et al. 1999), and two cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2 (Christie et al. 2014). In addition, red-light perception is carried out by phytochromes, while UV-B perception is carried out by protein UVR8 (Brown and Jenkins 2008). In addition to regulating phototropic growth, phytochromes have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes, from seed germination to plant senescence. To date, five phytochromes have been identified in Arabidopsis, and all have been linked to phototropistic response (Correll et al. 2003; Kiss et al. 2003; Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004; Kumar et al. 2008). The relationship between phototropism and gravitropism is a complex, poorly characterized interaction, where the direction of growth is an amalgamation of the two processes. To isolate phototropic response to a directional light source, the confounding gravity vector must first be removed. The utilization of facilities on board the International Space Station (ISS) provides the ability to conduct experiments in an environment of near-weightlessness, allowing for the study of “pure” phototropism, in the absence of a gravitropic response (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). Specifically, using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus module of the ISS provides the ability to study phototropic response to red or blue light in the absence of a unidirectional gravity vector. While plant growth and development in microgravity environments has been well characterized, considerably less is known about plant growth and development in fractional or reduced gravity environments (less than the nominal 1g; Kiss 2014). The EMCS contains a centrifuge which allows for the creation of gravity vectors to better characterize the interplay between gravitropism and phototropism. Our previous space experiments examined the phototropic response to red and blue light in microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g, and 1g environments (Kiss et al. 2012), providing insight on how plant growth and development may be effected on the Moon or Mars. Understanding how plants grow and develop in fractional gravity environment is an important step in successful habitation of the Moon or Mars. Furthermore, fractional gravity studies are helpful for the determination of thresholds of the gravity sensing and response of plants. In this study, we utilize micro-gravity as well as a continuum of fractional gravity (μ-g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, and 1g) to better characterize the phototropic responses to red and blue light. In addition, we analyze the effects of a brief, red-light pretreatment on blue-light-based phototropism.",

Arabidopsis roots and shoots exhibit markedly different phototropic curvatures in different gravity conditions upon exposure to red or blue light. Initially, plants were grown for 96 h with unilateral white light and simulated 1g in an attempt to standardize the orientation of all seedlings (Fig. 2). During photostimulation, gravity levels of 0g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, or 1g were generated via centrifugation. Images taken prior to directional light photostimulation allowed assessment of seedling growth and development (Fig. 1). Seedlings with slow germination or improper development were excluded from analyses. The phototropic response in roots was measured as positive growth (towards photostimulation) or negative growth (away from photostimulation) from the initial vertical state. Multiple regression analysis of root phototropic response found significant effects from gravity (P <2.2 × 10−16), light quality (P <2.74 × 10−15), and position (P < 2.08 × 10−9). Genotype also had a significant effect on phototropic response in root (P = 0.02; Table S3). The phototropic response of roots grown in blue light demonstrates a novel, positive phototropic response under microgravity (Figs. 3, 4). This response was attenuated at 0.1g, and is not present at higher gravity levels. In plants pretreated with red light for 1 h and subsequently exposed to blue light (Fig. 5), roots experience greater phototropic response (larger angles) when compared with blue-light exposure. Similar to blue-light root phototropism, the response is attenuated at 0.1g and not present in higher gravity levels. Finally, we observe a positive root phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 6), and the positive phototropic curvature decreases steadily as the magnitude of gravity increases.

The positive phototropic response to red light in roots exhibits an inverse relationship with magnitude of the gravity vector Similarly, multiple regression analysis was conducted for hypocotyls. Arabidopsis hypocotyls displayed significant effects from light (P < 2.2 × 10−16), genotype (P <0.05) and position (P < 4.9 × 10−5). However, no significant effect was detected for gravity (P = 0.055; Table S4). Not surprisingly, on Earth, the phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue-light phototropism shows a robust response immediately upon stimulation, followed by cessation once the hypocotyl reaches ~90° (Fig. 7). This same trend is also exhibited in hypocotyls of plants initially pretreated with red light and subsequent illuminated with blue light (Fig. 8). There is no significant gravity effect on the phototropic response in red light pretreated or blue light illuminated hypocotyls. In hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to red light, we observe a positive phototropic curvature in plants exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 9). Unlike hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to blue light, red-light exposure causes a steady positive phototropic response over time. However, similar to hypocotyls exposed to blue light, there is no significant effect of gravity on phototropic curvature. Fig. 7.

Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment Seedling position within the cassette also was shown to have a significant effect on phototropic curvature in both hypocotyls and roots. This is likely due to the variation in light intensity experienced within the seedling cassettes. Blue-light intensity decreases significantly the further the plant is from the light (Suppl. Fig. S1) ranging from 41.5 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position furthest from the LED. A similar trend is seen in red-light intensity, with illumination ranging from 59.6 μmol m−2 s−1 of light nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 furthest from the LED (Suppl. Fig. S2). To study the effects of microgravity on overall growth, we measured root and shoot lengths during the period of photostimulation. ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test of root (Table 1) and shoot (Table 2) total growth indicate that there are no significant differences in growth between microgravity and 1-g treatments. In addition, Pearson’s correlations were conducted to determine if overall growth was significantly correlated with phototropic curvature of seedlings. The correlation between total root growth and rate of root curvature was not significant (r = 0.20, P = 0.14), suggesting no relationship between root growth and curvature. However, in hypocotyls, the correlation between shoot growth and curvature was significant (r = 0.31, P = 0.02), suggesting that total shoot growth has an impact on rate of shoot curvature.

    "discussion": "Discussion Continued technical improvements to space experiments on plant tropisms Results from these experiments expand upon and optimize the previous experiments performed under conditions of microgravity and reduced gravity on board the ISS (Table 3). During the TROPI-1 series of experiments, germination rates were severely hampered by excess stowage time (>8 months) of the seeds prior to the activation of the experiment in space (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). During TROPI-2, we found that reducing the stowage time of seeds (<3 months) resulted in a dramatic increase in seed germination (Kiss et al. 2009). In addition, it was discovered after the conclusion of the TROPI experiments that utilization of the EMCS’s two-rotor setup resulted in a slight light contamination between the two rotors, which may have caused non-unidirectional light sources (Kiss et al. 2014). The current seedling growth set of experiments were conducted utilizing a single rotor of the EMCS to remove the possibility of between-rotor light contamination and have been optimized in many other ways (Table 3). The large range in sample sizes (6–50) of the various conditions was a product of multiple factors. Due to limited space, the design of the experiment necessitated an unbalanced experimental design, where half as many plants were grown under blue light or were pretreated with red light. In addition, there was reduced germination during the second spaceflight experiment for the Ler WT and PhyA genotypes. The reduction in germination in likely due to the extended period of time the seeds remained in hardware prior to spaceflight, as germination counts during flight build were in excess of 85 % (data not shown). Reducing the time between hardware build and execution of the experiment can help to increase germination rates and to maximize scientific return of space-flight experiments. Phototropic responses in roots Under the conditions of microgravity, a novel positive blue-light phototropic response was observed in roots of seedlings (Figs. 3, 4). While blue-light-based negative phototropism in roots has been extensively characterized in ground studies (Correll and Kiss 2002), this positive phototropic response is greatly reduced at 0.1g, and effectively negated at 0.3g and higher gravity levels. To date, this phototropic response has not previously been observed in the roots of Arabidopsis. This observation suggests that positive phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots is masked by the much more robust gravitropic response in Earth normal conditions, and the response can only be observed when the gravity vector is greatly reduced or eliminated, as can be observed in space experiments in orbiting vehicles. Interestingly, the relationship between the blue-light-positive phototropic response and gravity appears to represent a threshold model, where gravity levels between 0g and 0.1g eliminate the blue positive phototropic response. Interestingly, the previous clinorotation studies conducted by our group did not demonstrate positive phototropic curvature of roots when exposed to blue light. This observation suggests that while informative and beneficial, clinorotation studies are not a perfect proxy for actual microgravity, and further highlights the need for true spaceflight experiments. In addition to the blue-light phototropic response, a 1-h red-light pretreatment, followed by continuous blue illumination was tested (Fig. 5). Similar to the blue-light exposure only phototropic response revealed in roots, red-light pretreated roots exhibited an immediate and robust response in the direction of the blue-light photostimulus. The magnitude of the total positive phototropic curvature was at least 25 % greater in roots exposed to red-light pretreatment compared with those exposed solely to blue light. These results are not unexpected, as the previous studies of Arabidopsis have shown that etiolated (dark-grown) seedlings exposed to red-light pretreatment experience an increase in the blue-light phototropic response (Sakai and Haga 2012; Goyal et al. 2013). In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that overhead pretreatment with blue-light illumination also enhances the phototropic response (Sullivan et al. 2016). It has been proposed that this effect is due to red, far red, and blue light all acting together as an activator of phytochrome A, which leads to enhancement of the phototropic response (Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004). However, it is interesting to note that we do not see a significant difference in phototropic response in phyA mutants when compared with the wild type. This observation suggests that phytochrome A does not contribute to enhancement of blue-light positive phototropic response in roots. In addition, there is no apparent effect of genotype on the overall magnitude of phototropic response of roots pretreated with red light. A similar attenuation of positive phototropic curvature at 0.1g is also exhibited under red-light pretreatment when compared with non-pretreated samples. Cessation of curvature appears as a similar thresholding response between 0g and 0.1g, which negates positive phototropic curvature in red-light pretreated samples. As noted in our previous space experiments (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012), plant roots exposed to illumination with red light also experienced positive phototropic curvature (Fig. 6). The positive phototropic response is confirmed and is similar to what has previously been characterized during the TROPI experiments, however, the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature is greater than in the previous results (Kiss et al. 2012). Interestingly, two distinctions exist when comparing the root phototropic response to red vs. blue light. First, the positive phototropic curvature in response to red light is not eliminated at the onset of gravitational acceleration. Rather, it appears that the rate of root positive phototropic curvature is inversely correlated with the magnitude of the gravity vector, with the largest magnitude of curvature being experienced in seedlings exposed to microgravity. Second, there appears to be a genotype-specific effect at low gravity conditions, where the WT shows much higher levels of positive phototropic curvature when compared with phytochrome mutant varieties. However, this genotype effect appears to be negated at gravity levels of 0.5g and greater. Comparison of the root phototropic responses to red light and blue light reveals unique patterns between the two treatments. Utilization of fractional or reduced gravity conditions allowed for the identification of gravity levels that correspond with an attenuation of response, which differed between the two light treatments. Interestingly, a threshold value of 0.1–0.3g is enough to cease phototropic curvature in roots illuminated with blue light; however, this same threshold is not observed in red light, which exhibits something akin to a gravity dose response. This difference in response suggests that the mechanisms controlling the interaction between gravitropic response and phototropic response are different for red and blue light. In addition, the enhancement of the blue-light phototropic response in roots after red-light pretreatment suggests that while the two responses differ in pattern and potentially, mechanisms, there is still an additive effect that causes an enhancement to total phototropic curvature. The notion of positive blue-light phototropism in roots tends to contradict the traditional understanding of phototropic function, where roots move in the opposite direction of blue light to grow deeper into soil. However, these observed differences in phototropism between 1g and μg in Arabidopsis may reflect the evolutionary history of plants. For instance, plants from older evolutionary lineages, such as mosses and ferns, have a very versatile directional response to both red and blue light (Kiss 1994; Wada 2007; Li and Mathews 2016). Thus, microgravity may reveal mechanisms of phototropism that are normally masked by Earth nominal gravity conditions. It is possible that the near-linear relationship between red-light phototropic response and gravity in roots is a result of cytosolic calcium ions which have been thought to play a key role in the transmission of gravity sensing (Poovaiah et al. 1987; Gilroy et al. 1993; Correll et al. 2013), potentially through regulating the distribution of auxin and auxin transporters within the root cells (Benjamins et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2011; Shih et al. 2015). A study conducted by Toyota et al. (2013) utilized parabolic flight to examine the effects of reduced gravity gradients on calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This study examined the gravitropic response to gravity vectors ranging from 0.5g to 2.0g and found intercellular Ca2+ signaling exhibits a near-linear relationship with gravistimulation. This linear relationship between gravity sensing and Ca2+ signaling is the inverse of the observed red-light-induced phototropic curvature in roots observed in our present study, suggesting a potential antagonistic relationship with the root red-light phototropic response mechanisms. A recent study also utilized parabolic flights to examine cytosolic calcium levels on Arabidopsis cell cultures (Neef et al. 2015). In addition, this report demonstrated a clear link between several known Ca2+ inhibitors/antagonists and changes in cytosolic calcium due to gravity. However, this study also identified a single Ca2+ (nifedipine) inhibitor that had no effect on calcium signaling, suggesting the possibility of unique calcium channels or pumps involved in gravity signaling. It is possible that a gradual reduction in cytosolic calcium levels is responsible for the decreased positive phototropic response associated with increasing gravity. Phototropic responses in hypocotyls As in ground studies, plant hypocotyls exposed to continuous blue-light illumination showed an immediate and robust positive phototropic response in the direction of the light stimulus, followed by continuous growth at 90° in the direction of the light source (Fig. 7). As expected, there is no statistically significant effect of genotype on the phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to blue light. Gravity also did not have a significant effect on the direction, response time, or magnitude of hypocotyl phototropic curvature in response to unidirectional blue-light illumination. However, we do see a significant statistical correlation between the distances of the seedling from the light source, and the rate of positive phototropic curvature. These results correspond to our previous characterization of blue-light phototropic response in hypocotyls, where no increase in curvature was observed when exposed to microgravity conditions (Kiss et al. 2012). Red-light pretreatment of seedlings exposed to blue light did not result in an observable increase in the rate of positive phototropic response, and the pattern of phototropic curvature mirrored those seedlings that were not exposed to red-light pretreatment (Fig. 8). Interestingly, a recent study found that curvature enhancements stemming from red- or blue-light pretreatments were affected by light intensity, where higher fluence rates of the directional light caused a reduction in phototropic curvature (Sullivan et al. 2016). It is possible that enhancement of phototropic curvature was not observed in this case due to fluence rates that were high enough to inhibit the enhancement of curvature. In addition, it is possible that due to the rapid phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue light, we were unable to capture differences in curvature rate from the frequency of images we obtained (every 30 min). Increasing the rate of image capture (e.g., every 5 min) would likely help to identify enhancements in phototropic curvature of hypocotyls pretreated with red light. Analyses of seedlings grown in microgravity conditions and exposed to red light (Fig. 9) have confirmed previously characterized positive phototropic curvature of Arabidopsis hypocotyls (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). This positive hypocotyl curvature was previously characterized during the TROPI experiment series, however, it must be noted that the magnitude of the positive phototropic curvatures is less than what was measured during TROPI-2 (Kiss et al. 2012). These results are similar in magnitude and in accordance with results obtained from the TROPI-1 experiment (Millar et al. 2010). These differences can likely be attributed to the light contamination between rotors in the earlier experiments (Kiss et al. 2014), as all other conditions within the experiment were unaltered. In addition, the magnitude of positive hypocotyl phototropism when exposed to red light does not appear to be contingent on the gravity vector, whereas the previous study found a significant difference in rates of phototropic curvature in hypocotyls exposed to low gravity (μg or 0.1g) versus more substantial gravity vectors (0.3g or 1g). Previously, positive phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to red light was shown to be enhanced in phyB mutants when compared with phyA and WT varieties (Kiss et al. 2012). However, as all three genotypes tested show positive phototropic responses that were not significantly different, these results were not reproduced in this study. Again, we attribute these differences to the fact that we have improved the experimental conditions in this report by eliminating the stray light between rotors in the current studies. Phototropic responses and illumination intensity Multiple regression analyses of phototropic curvature in both roots and shoots revealed position as a significant variable that predicts the rate of phototropic curvature. This effect is due to the observed differences in illumination across the membrane as the distance from the light source increases (Suppl. Fig. S1 and S2). Therefore, within a cassette where all seedlings are exposed to directional light for the same duration, seedlings furthest from the light source receive reduced fluency from the lights, and, in turn, exhibit reduced phototropic curvature. However, while the magnitude of curvature differed significantly across fluence rates, the overall proportional trend in curvature was conserved. The relationship between fluence rates and phototropic curvature is well characterized (Janoudi and Poff 1990; Sakai et al. 2001). Traditionally, illumination and curvature of hypocotyls follow the Bunsen-Roscoe law, where curvature is a product of illumination intensity and the duration of exposure (Bunsen and Roscoe 1863). However, the previous studies characterizing phototropic response have reported that this relationship ceases to be valid at illumination intensities of greater than 0.01 μmol m−2 (Janoudi and Poff 1990), well below the light intensity used in this study. In addition, illumination intensity has previously been shown to have no effect on phototropic curvature of hypocotyls of WT seedlings (Sakai et al. 2001). It also is possible that the significant effect of position on phototropic curvature is the result of the use of non-etiolated seedlings, which our previous spaceflight studies utilized.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions In this study, we characterize a novel blue-light phototropism that is present in microgravity, but is attenuated at low (0.1–0.3g) gravity levels. One-hour red-light pre-treatment followed by blue-light illumination enhanced the rate of positive phototropic curvature in roots. In addition, positive phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red-light was observed; however, increasing levels of gravity causes a gradual reduction in the magnitude of curvature as opposed to the drastic cessation observed under blue-light exposure. The red-light phototropic response of hypocotyls in microgravity, which we have previously characterized, was also confirmed. In addition, the present report shows the value of repetition of space experiments as is usual in ground experiments (Kiss 2015). In the first experiments (TROPI-1 and TROPI-2), we encountered a number of technical issues and obstacles (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). In the more recent Seedling Growth experiments, we were able to solve the technical issues and overcome the limitations of the previous projects (Table 3; Kiss et al. 2014). Thus, in this better controlled light environment in the EMCS, we were able to make new discoveries on the positive phototropism of roots in response to blue light that has added to the previous reports of novel mechanisms of red-light sensing that has been revealed in microgravity. It is clear that effectively removing the ubiquitous gravity vector in spaceflight experiments allows researchers to better understand the myriad of phototropic responses in plants.",

Copyright notice ID: 5748516 MSID: MS926550 PMID: 27507239 The publisher's version of this article is available at Planta Abstract Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity. Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1g. A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities. Keywords: Arabidopsis, Fractional gravity, Microgravity, Phototropism, Reduced gravity, SpaceflightIntroduction Plant tropisms are growth-mediated movements relative to the direction of an external stimulus. In early studies, these movements were first characterized by Darwin and Darwin (1880), however, description of plant movement actually dates back to the Ancient Romans (Ovid 8 AD 2008). Plants exhibit these growth-mediated responses to external cues, including water (hydrotropism, Kiss 2007), touch or contact (thigmotropism, Braam 2005), the sun or light (heliotropism and phototropism, respectively Briggs 1964; Vandenbrink et al. 2014a, b; Kutschera and Briggs 2016), and gravity (gravitropism, Chen et al. 1999; Kiss 2000) among others. Tropisms are important for plants, which as sessile organisms, utilize these movements to respond to external stimuli (Kaufman et al. 1987; Whippo and Hangarter 2004). Typically, in ground studies, plants respond to blue-light photostimulation positively (growth towards the light) in shoots, and negatively (growth away from the light source) in roots (Kutschera and Briggs 2012; Briggs 2014; Liscum et al. 2014). Recently, a positive red-light-based phototropic response in roots mediated by phytochromes has been observed and characterized (Kiss et al. 2003; Molas and Kiss 2008), in addition to positive hypocotyl phototropic response to red light in the conditions of microgravity (Millar et al. 2010). However, the magnitude of phototropic response is less during red-light stimulation compared with the robust response to blue light. In terms of gravitropic response, in general, plants respond to the gravity vector by growing roots in the direction of gravity, and shoots opposite of the gravity vector. The amalgamation of tropistic movements results in the overall direction and form of plant growth (Correll and Kiss 2002). Plants utilize both gravity and light cues to direct plant growth and development. In addition to directing root growth towards the gravity vector, sunlight can penetrate the soil up to several millimeters beneath the soil surface, having a direct effect on the growth and development of roots (Woolley and Stoller 1978; Tester and Morris 1987). The red and far-red part of the light spectrum can penetrate to greater depths than blue light (Mandoli and Briggs 1984) which has led to plants evolving blue-light receptors located near the upper portion of roots and red-light receptors near the apices due to this pattern of light penetration (Mo et al. 2015). In addition, it has been shown that plants utilize blue-light cues to control root architectural features, such as lateral root growth (Moni et al. 2015). Light perception by the roots may also impact plant growth and development elsewhere, as light signals sensed by root apices have also been shown to have an effect on shoot gravitropic response (Hopkins and Kiss 2012). Taken together, these observations suggest that light perception within the root plays a dynamic role in plant development. Specifically, an effect of light irradiation on shortening the root length has been reported (Silva-Navas et al. 2015), although other works have shown higher rates of root elongation under light-grown conditions (Laxmi et al. 2008). Modulation of cell-cycle progression by photoreceptors in meristems is well known, but there are data indicating that this action of light is different in the root and in the shoot meristems (López-Juez et al. 2008; Silva-Navas et al. 2015). To perceive light stimuli, plants contain specialized photoreceptor proteins specific to red, blue, and UV-B light. Plants sense blue light via two types of light receptors: cryptochromes and phototropins. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, PHOT1 and PHOT2 (Christie et al. 1999), and two cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2 (Christie et al. 2014). In addition, red-light perception is carried out by phytochromes, while UV-B perception is carried out by protein UVR8 (Brown and Jenkins 2008). In addition to regulating phototropic growth, phytochromes have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes, from seed germination to plant senescence. To date, five phytochromes have been identified in Arabidopsis, and all have been linked to phototropistic response (Correll et al. 2003; Kiss et al. 2003; Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004; Kumar et al. 2008). The relationship between phototropism and gravitropism is a complex, poorly characterized interaction, where the direction of growth is an amalgamation of the two processes. To isolate phototropic response to a directional light source, the confounding gravity vector must first be removed. The utilization of facilities on board the International Space Station (ISS) provides the ability to conduct experiments in an environment of near-weightlessness, allowing for the study of “pure” phototropism, in the absence of a gravitropic response (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). Specifically, using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus module of the ISS provides the ability to study phototropic response to red or blue light in the absence of a unidirectional gravity vector. While plant growth and development in microgravity environments has been well characterized, considerably less is known about plant growth and development in fractional or reduced gravity environments (less than the nominal 1g; Kiss 2014). The EMCS contains a centrifuge which allows for the creation of gravity vectors to better characterize the interplay between gravitropism and phototropism. Our previous space experiments examined the phototropic response to red and blue light in microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g, and 1g environments (Kiss et al. 2012), providing insight on how plant growth and development may be effected on the Moon or Mars. Understanding how plants grow and develop in fractional gravity environment is an important step in successful habitation of the Moon or Mars. Furthermore, fractional gravity studies are helpful for the determination of thresholds of the gravity sensing and response of plants. In this study, we utilize micro-gravity as well as a continuum of fractional gravity (μ-g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, and 1g) to better characterize the phototropic responses to red and blue light. In addition, we analyze the effects of a brief, red-light pretreatment on blue-light-based phototropism.Materials and methods Plant materials and the spaceflight experiment Three genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana were utilized for this study (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA): wild-type ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler), and the phytochrome mutant’s phyA-201 and phyB-1 (Kiss et al. 2003). Space-flight studies were conducted utilizing the EMCS on the ISS. The EMCS consists of two centrifuges with atmosphere regulation, including ethylene removal, as well as remote hydration control (Brinckmann and Schiller 2002; Brinckmann 2005; Kiss et al. 2014). The utilization of the onboard centrifuge provides an important control with the ability to separate microgravity effects from the other environmental conditions associated with spaceflight (Vandenbrink and Kiss 2016). The EMCS also contains a Sony FCB-IX470 video camera for image acquisition. This experiment was conducted in two parts, with the first set of seedlings being transferred to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-2 (March 2013) followed by return via CRS-3, and the second set being carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (September 2015). Two sets of experimental runs were performed, the first set during ISS increments 35–36, and the second during ISS increment 41.Space hardware and procedures Hardware utilized in this experiment has previously been described (Correll and Kiss 2005; Kiss et al. 2009). Briefly, each experimental container (EC) holds five individual seedling growth cassettes with an LED light source (white, red and blue; Fig. 1). Before flight, seeds were surface sterilized in ethanol and air dried under a laminar flow. The seedling growth media contain 50 % (w/v) Murashige and Skoog salts with 1-mM Mes buffer (pH 5.5). Whatman # 17filter paper was soaked in media and allowed to dry.Seeds were attached to a black gridded nitrocellulose membrane via 1 % (w/v) gum guar. Five seedling cassettes were placed into each EC and stored until launch (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Images of seedlings in cassettes in an EC during a spaceflight experiment run in the EMCS. Seedlings in white light (a) at the beginning of the photostimulation period (0 h) and in red light (b) at the end of photostimulation (48 h). The vertical numbers indicate GMT, Greenwich mean time. White arrows labeled g and L represent the direction of gravity and light vectors, respectivelyProcedures during the spaceflight experiment Experimental containers (Ecs) were transferred to the EMCS on the ISS as described in Kiss et al. (2014). Briefly, experimental conditions were controlled telemetrically from the Norwegian User Support and Operations Centre (N-USOC, Trondheim, Norway), and the initiation of the experiment was conducted via hydration of the seeds. Plants were grown under six gravity conditions: microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, and 1.0g. Seedlings were initially grown under white light (30–40 μmol m−2 s−1) for 96 h, followed by unidirectional photostimulation with red light, blue light, or red → blue light (Fig. 2). Directional photostimulation occurred for 48 h. Illumination intensity throughout the cassette was measured for both blue (Suppl. Fig. S1) and red light (Suppl. Fig. S2) with a Li-Cor LI-189 Quantum Radiometer Photometer. After conclusion of the experiments, seedlings were frozen and stored at −80 °C on the ISS. This manuscript presents the results of image analyses, and future papers will consider the gene experiment profile obtained from the frozen seedlings. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Timeline of operations for the seedling growth experimentsImage and data analyses Growth and curvature of seedlings were measured using the program ImageJ (v.1.50e). Curvature was measured as change in degrees from starting position (defined as 0°). Angles were measured at the initiation of directional red or blue light and subsequently every 30 min for a total of 48.5 h. The number of samples measured for growth and angle per treatment ranged from 6 to 50 and are indicated in Tables S1 and S2. Positive curvature values were defined as growth in the direction of stimulus, and negative curvature was defined as growth away from the stimulus. Analysis of growth and curvature for each genotype was conducted utilizing linear regression of growth rate using the program R 64-bit (version 3.1.3). Regression coefficients compared via one-way ANOVA and subsequent Tukey’s honest significant difference test (P <0.05) were used to identify significant differences between plant growth rates. Data analyses were conducted via linear regression and subsequent ANOVA in R (3.1.3) using the car, multcomp, and agricolae packages. The multiple test correction was conducted using Tukey’s honest significance test (P <0.05). Multiple regression analysis was performed utilizing the following response variables: light-red, blue, or a 1 h red pretreatment before continuous blue illumination; genotype—Ler wild-type, or phytochrome mutants phyA and phyB; gravity—a continuum ranging from 0g/microgravity to 1g; and seedling position—ranging 1–14, with 1 being closes to the source of illumination and 14 the furthest.Results The aim of this study was to investigate phototropism under a continuum of gravity conditions from microgravity, to partial (reduced) gravity, to 1g. Arabidopsis roots and shoots exhibit markedly different phototropic curvatures in different gravity conditions upon exposure to red or blue light. Initially, plants were grown for 96 h with unilateral white light and simulated 1g in an attempt to standardize the orientation of all seedlings (Fig. 2). During photostimulation, gravity levels of 0g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, or 1g were generated via centrifugation. Images taken prior to directional light photostimulation allowed assessment of seedling growth and development (Fig. 1). Seedlings with slow germination or improper development were excluded from analyses. The phototropic response in roots was measured as positive growth (towards photostimulation) or negative growth (away from photostimulation) from the initial vertical state. Multiple regression analysis of root phototropic response found significant effects from gravity (P <2.2 × 10−16), light quality (P <2.74 × 10−15), and position (P < 2.08 × 10−9). Genotype also had a significant effect on phototropic response in root (P = 0.02; Table S3). The phototropic response of roots grown in blue light demonstrates a novel, positive phototropic response under microgravity (Figs. 3, 4). This response was attenuated at 0.1g, and is not present at higher gravity levels. In plants pretreated with red light for 1 h and subsequently exposed to blue light (Fig. 5), roots experience greater phototropic response (larger angles) when compared with blue-light exposure. Similar to blue-light root phototropism, the response is attenuated at 0.1g and not present in higher gravity levels. Finally, we observe a positive root phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 6), and the positive phototropic curvature decreases steadily as the magnitude of gravity increases.

Open in a new tab Phototropic response in roots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. The positive phototropic response to red light in roots exhibits an inverse relationship with magnitude of the gravity vectorSimilarly, multiple regression analysis was conducted for hypocotyls. Arabidopsis hypocotyls displayed significant effects from light (P < 2.2 × 10−16), genotype (P <0.05) and position (P < 4.9 × 10−5). However, no significant effect was detected for gravity (P = 0.055; Table S4). Not surprisingly, on Earth, the phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue-light phototropism shows a robust response immediately upon stimulation, followed by cessation once the hypocotyl reaches ~90° (Fig. 7). This same trend is also exhibited in hypocotyls of plants initially pretreated with red light and subsequent illuminated with blue light (Fig. 8). There is no significant gravity effect on the phototropic response in red light pretreated or blue light illuminated hypocotyls. In hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to red light, we observe a positive phototropic curvature in plants exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 9). Unlike hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to blue light, red-light exposure causes a steady positive phototropic response over time. However, similar to hypocotyls exposed to blue light, there is no significant effect of gravity on phototropic curvature. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to unilateral blue light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. Positive phototropic response of shoots to blue light is not significantly affected by gravityFig. 8. Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to blue light preceded by a 1-h red pretreatment in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. Positive phototropic response of shoots to blue light is not enhanced by 1-h red-light pretreatmentFig. 9. Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experimentSeedling position within the cassette also was shown to have a significant effect on phototropic curvature in both hypocotyls and roots. This is likely due to the variation in light intensity experienced within the seedling cassettes. Blue-light intensity decreases significantly the further the plant is from the light (Suppl. Fig. S1) ranging from 41.5 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position furthest from the LED. A similar trend is seen in red-light intensity, with illumination ranging from 59.6 μmol m−2 s−1 of light nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 furthest from the LED (Suppl. Fig. S2). To study the effects of microgravity on overall growth, we measured root and shoot lengths during the period of photostimulation. ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test of root (Table 1) and shoot (Table 2) total growth indicate that there are no significant differences in growth between microgravity and 1-g treatments. In addition, Pearson’s correlations were conducted to determine if overall growth was significantly correlated with phototropic curvature of seedlings. The correlation between total root growth and rate of root curvature was not significant (r = 0.20, P = 0.14), suggesting no relationship between root growth and curvature. However, in hypocotyls, the correlation between shoot growth and curvature was significant (r = 0.31, P = 0.02), suggesting that total shoot growth has an impact on rate of shoot curvature.

During the TROPI-1 series of experiments, germination rates were severely hampered by excess stowage time (>8 months) of the seeds prior to the activation of the experiment in space (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). During TROPI-2, we found that reducing the stowage time of seeds (<3 months) resulted in a dramatic increase in seed germination (Kiss et al. 2009). In addition, it was discovered after the conclusion of the TROPI experiments that utilization of the EMCS’s two-rotor setup resulted in a slight light contamination between the two rotors, which may have caused non-unidirectional light sources (Kiss et al. 2014). The current seedling growth set of experiments were conducted utilizing a single rotor of the EMCS to remove the possibility of between-rotor light contamination and have been optimized in many other ways (Table 3). The large range in sample sizes (6–50) of the various conditions was a product of multiple factors. Due to limited space, the design of the experiment necessitated an unbalanced experimental design, where half as many plants were grown under blue light or were pretreated with red light. In addition, there was reduced germination during the second spaceflight experiment for the Ler WT and PhyA genotypes. The reduction in germination in likely due to the extended period of time the seeds remained in hardware prior to spaceflight, as germination counts during flight build were in excess of 85 % (data not shown). Reducing the time between hardware build and execution of the experiment can help to increase germination rates and to maximize scientific return of space-flight experiments.Phototropic responses in roots Under the conditions of microgravity, a novel positive blue-light phototropic response was observed in roots of seedlings (Figs. 3, 4). While blue-light-based negative phototropism in roots has been extensively characterized in ground studies (Correll and Kiss 2002), this positive phototropic response is greatly reduced at 0.1g, and effectively negated at 0.3g and higher gravity levels. To date, this phototropic response has not previously been observed in the roots of Arabidopsis. This observation suggests that positive phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots is masked by the much more robust gravitropic response in Earth normal conditions, and the response can only be observed when the gravity vector is greatly reduced or eliminated, as can be observed in space experiments in orbiting vehicles. Interestingly, the relationship between the blue-light-positive phototropic response and gravity appears to represent a threshold model, where gravity levels between 0g and 0.1g eliminate the blue positive phototropic response. Interestingly, the previous clinorotation studies conducted by our group did not demonstrate positive phototropic curvature of roots when exposed to blue light. This observation suggests that while informative and beneficial, clinorotation studies are not a perfect proxy for actual microgravity, and further highlights the need for true spaceflight experiments. In addition to the blue-light phototropic response, a 1-h red-light pretreatment, followed by continuous blue illumination was tested (Fig. 5). Similar to the blue-light exposure only phototropic response revealed in roots, red-light pretreated roots exhibited an immediate and robust response in the direction of the blue-light photostimulus. The magnitude of the total positive phototropic curvature was at least 25 % greater in roots exposed to red-light pretreatment compared with those exposed solely to blue light. These results are not unexpected, as the previous studies of Arabidopsis have shown that etiolated (dark-grown) seedlings exposed to red-light pretreatment experience an increase in the blue-light phototropic response (Sakai and Haga 2012; Goyal et al. 2013). In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that overhead pretreatment with blue-light illumination also enhances the phototropic response (Sullivan et al. 2016). It has been proposed that this effect is due to red, far red, and blue light all acting together as an activator of phytochrome A, which leads to enhancement of the phototropic response (Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004). However, it is interesting to note that we do not see a significant difference in phototropic response in phyA mutants when compared with the wild type. This observation suggests that phytochrome A does not contribute to enhancement of blue-light positive phototropic response in roots. In addition, there is no apparent effect of genotype on the overall magnitude of phototropic response of roots pretreated with red light. A similar attenuation of positive phototropic curvature at 0.1g is also exhibited under red-light pretreatment when compared with non-pretreated samples. Cessation of curvature appears as a similar thresholding response between 0g and 0.1g, which negates positive phototropic curvature in red-light pretreated samples. As noted in our previous space experiments (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012), plant roots exposed to illumination with red light also experienced positive phototropic curvature (Fig. 6). The positive phototropic response is confirmed and is similar to what has previously been characterized during the TROPI experiments, however, the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature is greater than in the previous results (Kiss et al. 2012). Interestingly, two distinctions exist when comparing the root phototropic response to red vs. blue light. First, the positive phototropic curvature in response to red light is not eliminated at the onset of gravitational acceleration. Rather, it appears that the rate of root positive phototropic curvature is inversely correlated with the magnitude of the gravity vector, with the largest magnitude of curvature being experienced in seedlings exposed to microgravity. Second, there appears to be a genotype-specific effect at low gravity conditions, where the WT shows much higher levels of positive phototropic curvature when compared with phytochrome mutant varieties. However, this genotype effect appears to be negated at gravity levels of 0.5g and greater. Comparison of the root phototropic responses to red light and blue light reveals unique patterns between the two treatments. Utilization of fractional or reduced gravity conditions allowed for the identification of gravity levels that correspond with an attenuation of response, which differed between the two light treatments. Interestingly, a threshold value of 0.1–0.3g is enough to cease phototropic curvature in roots illuminated with blue light; however, this same threshold is not observed in red light, which exhibits something akin to a gravity dose response. This difference in response suggests that the mechanisms controlling the interaction between gravitropic response and phototropic response are different for red and blue light. In addition, the enhancement of the blue-light phototropic response in roots after red-light pretreatment suggests that while the two responses differ in pattern and potentially, mechanisms, there is still an additive effect that causes an enhancement to total phototropic curvature. The notion of positive blue-light phototropism in roots tends to contradict the traditional understanding of phototropic function, where roots move in the opposite direction of blue light to grow deeper into soil. However, these observed differences in phototropism between 1g and μg in Arabidopsis may reflect the evolutionary history of plants. For instance, plants from older evolutionary lineages, such as mosses and ferns, have a very versatile directional response to both red and blue light (Kiss 1994; Wada 2007; Li and Mathews 2016). Thus, microgravity may reveal mechanisms of phototropism that are normally masked by Earth nominal gravity conditions. It is possible that the near-linear relationship between red-light phototropic response and gravity in roots is a result of cytosolic calcium ions which have been thought to play a key role in the transmission of gravity sensing (Poovaiah et al. 1987; Gilroy et al. 1993; Correll et al. 2013), potentially through regulating the distribution of auxin and auxin transporters within the root cells (Benjamins et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2011; Shih et al. 2015). A study conducted by Toyota et al. (2013) utilized parabolic flight to examine the effects of reduced gravity gradients on calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This study examined the gravitropic response to gravity vectors ranging from 0.5g to 2.0g and found intercellular Ca2+ signaling exhibits a near-linear relationship with gravistimulation. This linear relationship between gravity sensing and Ca2+ signaling is the inverse of the observed red-light-induced phototropic curvature in roots observed in our present study, suggesting a potential antagonistic relationship with the root red-light phototropic response mechanisms. A recent study also utilized parabolic flights to examine cytosolic calcium levels on Arabidopsis cell cultures (Neef et al. 2015). In addition, this report demonstrated a clear link between several known Ca2+ inhibitors/antagonists and changes in cytosolic calcium due to gravity. However, this study also identified a single Ca2+ (nifedipine) inhibitor that had no effect on calcium signaling, suggesting the possibility of unique calcium channels or pumps involved in gravity signaling. It is possible that a gradual reduction in cytosolic calcium levels is responsible for the decreased positive phototropic response associated with increasing gravity.Phototropic responses in hypocotyls As in ground studies, plant hypocotyls exposed to continuous blue-light illumination showed an immediate and robust positive phototropic response in the direction of the light stimulus, followed by continuous growth at 90° in the direction of the light source (Fig. 7). As expected, there is no statistically significant effect of genotype on the phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to blue light. Gravity also did not have a significant effect on the direction, response time, or magnitude of hypocotyl phototropic curvature in response to unidirectional blue-light illumination. However, we do see a significant statistical correlation between the distances of the seedling from the light source, and the rate of positive phototropic curvature. These results correspond to our previous characterization of blue-light phototropic response in hypocotyls, where no increase in curvature was observed when exposed to microgravity conditions (Kiss et al. 2012). Red-light pretreatment of seedlings exposed to blue light did not result in an observable increase in the rate of positive phototropic response, and the pattern of phototropic curvature mirrored those seedlings that were not exposed to red-light pretreatment (Fig. 8). Interestingly, a recent study found that curvature enhancements stemming from red- or blue-light pretreatments were affected by light intensity, where higher fluence rates of the directional light caused a reduction in phototropic curvature (Sullivan et al. 2016). It is possible that enhancement of phototropic curvature was not observed in this case due to fluence rates that were high enough to inhibit the enhancement of curvature. In addition, it is possible that due to the rapid phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue light, we were unable to capture differences in curvature rate from the frequency of images we obtained (every 30 min). Increasing the rate of image capture (e.g., every 5 min) would likely help to identify enhancements in phototropic curvature of hypocotyls pretreated with red light. Analyses of seedlings grown in microgravity conditions and exposed to red light (Fig. 9) have confirmed previously characterized positive phototropic curvature of Arabidopsis hypocotyls (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). This positive hypocotyl curvature was previously characterized during the TROPI experiment series, however, it must be noted that the magnitude of the positive phototropic curvatures is less than what was measured during TROPI-2 (Kiss et al. 2012). These results are similar in magnitude and in accordance with results obtained from the TROPI-1 experiment (Millar et al. 2010). These differences can likely be attributed to the light contamination between rotors in the earlier experiments (Kiss et al. 2014), as all other conditions within the experiment were unaltered. In addition, the magnitude of positive hypocotyl phototropism when exposed to red light does not appear to be contingent on the gravity vector, whereas the previous study found a significant difference in rates of phototropic curvature in hypocotyls exposed to low gravity (μg or 0.1g) versus more substantial gravity vectors (0.3g or 1g). Previously, positive phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to red light was shown to be enhanced in phyB mutants when compared with phyA and WT varieties (Kiss et al. 2012). However, as all three genotypes tested show positive phototropic responses that were not significantly different, these results were not reproduced in this study. Again, we attribute these differences to the fact that we have improved the experimental conditions in this report by eliminating the stray light between rotors in the current studies.Phototropic responses and illumination intensity Multiple regression analyses of phototropic curvature in both roots and shoots revealed position as a significant variable that predicts the rate of phototropic curvature. This effect is due to the observed differences in illumination across the membrane as the distance from the light source increases (Suppl. Fig. S1 and S2). Therefore, within a cassette where all seedlings are exposed to directional light for the same duration, seedlings furthest from the light source receive reduced fluency from the lights, and, in turn, exhibit reduced phototropic curvature. However, while the magnitude of curvature differed significantly across fluence rates, the overall proportional trend in curvature was conserved. The relationship between fluence rates and phototropic curvature is well characterized (Janoudi and Poff 1990; Sakai et al. 2001). Traditionally, illumination and curvature of hypocotyls follow the Bunsen-Roscoe law, where curvature is a product of illumination intensity and the duration of exposure (Bunsen and Roscoe 1863). However, the previous studies characterizing phototropic response have reported that this relationship ceases to be valid at illumination intensities of greater than 0.01 μmol m−2 (Janoudi and Poff 1990), well below the light intensity used in this study. In addition, illumination intensity has previously been shown to have no effect on phototropic curvature of hypocotyls of WT seedlings (Sakai et al. 2001). It also is possible that the significant effect of position on phototropic curvature is the result of the use of non-etiolated seedlings, which our previous spaceflight studies utilized.Conclusions In this study, we characterize a novel blue-light phototropism that is present in microgravity, but is attenuated at low (0.1–0.3g) gravity levels. One-hour red-light pre-treatment followed by blue-light illumination enhanced the rate of positive phototropic curvature in roots. In addition, positive phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red-light was observed; however, increasing levels of gravity causes a gradual reduction in the magnitude of curvature as opposed to the drastic cessation observed under blue-light exposure. The red-light phototropic response of hypocotyls in microgravity, which we have previously characterized, was also confirmed. In addition, the present report shows the value of repetition of space experiments as is usual in ground experiments (Kiss 2015). In the first experiments (TROPI-1 and TROPI-2), we encountered a number of technical issues and obstacles (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). In the more recent Seedling Growth experiments, we were able to solve the technical issues and overcome the limitations of the previous projects (Table 3; Kiss et al. 2014). Thus, in this better controlled light environment in the EMCS, we were able to make new discoveries on the positive phototropism of roots in response to blue light that has added to the previous reports of novel mechanisms of red-light sensing that has been revealed in microgravity. It is clear that effectively removing the ubiquitous gravity vector in spaceflight experiments allows researchers to better understand the myriad of phototropic responses in plants.Supplementary Material SuppFig1 MS926550-supplement-SuppFig1.tif (155KB, tif) SuppFig2 MS926550-supplement-SuppFig2.tif (149.8KB, tif) SuppTable1 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable1.tif (141.4KB, tif) SuppTable2 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable2.tif (146.5KB, tif) SuppTable3 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable3.tif (90.7KB, tif) SuppTable4 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable4.tif (89.3KB, tif) Acknowledgments Funding for this study was provided by NASA Grant NNX12A065G, and we would like to acknowledge the fine support of NASA’s Ames Research Center.

In addition, all three studies found differential regulation of genes associated with cell wall remodeling and stress responses between spaceflight-grown and ground control plants.Keywords: cell wall, cytoskeleton, dehydration, glycome profiling, transcriptome, heat shock, XERO1, FH2, AGP, XTH Spaceflight is potentially stressful for biological systems. Understanding this unique environment and its impact on gene regulation is a critical step in planning for long-duration spaceflight missions (Perbal, 2008; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). In support of these exploration missions, bioregenerative life support systems will use plants as a source of food, fuel, and fiber for space explorers (Mitchell, 1994; Paradiso et al., 2013). However, environmental factors such as cosmic radiation, craft vibration, and microgravity (μg) can detrimentally influence plant development (Kranz, 1986; Mitchell, 1994). Morphological variances have been previously observed in spaceflight-grown plants relative to ground controls. These include decreased starch content and altered cell shape as a result of cell wall perturbation (Johnson et al., 2015), as well as more adventitious roots, waving of roots (Paul et al., 2012b) and a unidirectional skewing of shoots and roots (Millar et al., 2011). Consequently, the unique environment of spaceflight may negatively impact the yield of crops grown as part of the bioregenerative life support systems. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which plants respond to spaceflight, including alterations in gene expression, is critical for designing crops that can produce high yields in these unique environments. Transcriptomics provides a means of screening for gene expression in biological specimens. Microarrays are used for transcriptomic spaceflight experiments because they can produce meaningful results from small sample sizes. Several recent studies have compared the transcriptomes of spaceflight-grown and Earth-grown Arabidopsis seedlings (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013; Zupanska et al., 2013; Correll et al., 2013; Fengler et al., 2015; Kwon et al., 2015). In these experiments, four different types of flight hardware were used: the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS), Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS), Science in Microgravity box (SIMbox), and Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC). EMCS and ABRS were used in the International Space Station, SIMbox was used on the Shenzhou 8 Chinese spacecraft, and BRIC was used on the Space Shuttle. Unfortunately, comparative analyses among these transcriptomics experiments are limited due to differences in hardware, different genotypes, varying numbers of replicates, and different procedures for handling tissues (Paul et al., 2012b). However, despite these different approaches, there are some overlapping biochemical pathways that have been identified to be differentially regulated in spaceflight. These include pathways involved in heat shock, stress response, cell wall modification, and cell defense. Spaceflight experiments are complex, and the results obtained by plant space biologists have been variable due to differences in approaches and hardware design. For example, using the EMCS hardware on the ISS, the TROPI2 experiment investigated gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings (Correll et al., 2013). This transcriptomics study had 280 transcripts differentially regulated at least 2-fold in spaceflight compared with the ground controls. The spaceflight hardware included an onboard centrifuge, so a comparison of 1 g spaceflight with μg spaceflight was possible. This spaceflight 1 g vs. μg comparison revealed only 27 transcripts differentially regulated 2-fold or more (P < 0.01). The transcripts that were differentially expressed included many that were responsible for cell wall functionality, cell defense, cell stress, oxygen status, cell wall development, cell polarity including auxin, and lipid metabolism, among others. Another study used the ABRS flight hardware, which is a different hardware system from the EMCS (Paul et al., 2012a, 2013). These studies found that 408 transcripts were differentially regulated at least 1.9-fold and 58 that were at least 7-fold different in spaceflight compared with the ground control (P < 0.01). Each organ was found to have specific and unique responses to the spaceflight environment, which followed an overall change in morphology of the plant body including a change in cell wall architecture (Paul et al., 2013). In yet another hardware scenario, SIMbox, was flown in a joint Chinese and German experiment (Fengler et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017), and the hardware included a centrifuge to provide a 1 g spaceflight control. In this project, 298 genes, with a high P-value (P < 0.1), were reported as differentially regulated 2-fold or more between space and ground control plants. Transcripts involved with cell defense response, pathogen-response, and pathogen-resistance genes were among the differentially expressed genes reported, along with calcium-signaling related MAP kinases and reactive oxygen species (Fengler et al., 2015). Thus, with these several recent spaceflight studies, it is difficult to find similar correlations in the data among the different investigators, largely due to differences in experimental design and diverse hardware. However, one cluster of recent studies from spaceflight experiments is distinguished by similar methodology and hardware, and, therefore, these results can be thoroughly compared. In 2010, three research groups performed individual experiments in the BRIC-Petri Dish Fixation Unit (BRIC-PDFU) hardware as part of the STS-131 mission on the Space Shuttle. Each group used Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism, and all of these experiments performed transcriptome analyses on the spaceflight samples and compared them to ground controls. These experiments were entitled: Actin Regulation of Arabidopsis Root Growth and Orientation During Space Flight (BRIC-16-Regulation; NASA, 2016b). Impact of Spaceflight on Arabidopsis: Deep Sequencing and DNA Arrays as Collaborative Readouts of the Transcriptome of Arabidopsis Seedlings and Undifferentiated Cells in Space (BRIC-16-DNA; NASA, 2016c). Investigations of the Plant Cytoskeleton in Microgravity with Gene Profiling and Cytochemistry (BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton; NASA, 2016a). The purpose of the BRIC-16-Regulation (BRIC-16-Reg; E. Blancaflor, Principal Investigator) experiment was to compare microtubule development within the roots of wild-type and actin mutants in μg (Kwon et al., 2015; Nakashima et al., 2014). The wild type used in this experiment was Columbia (Col-0). This experiment found that there were more transcripts downregulated (148) than upregulated (26) at least 4-fold or more in spaceflight. Downregulated transcripts were mainly nuclear-encoded, while upregulated were mainly encoded in the plastid. The BRIC-16-Reg project focused on oxidative stress and cell wall structure in response to μg, as exhibited by the shorter root hairs present in spaceflight samples compared to ground controls (Kwon et al., 2015). BRIC-16-DNA (A.-L. Paul, Principal Investigator) studied gene expression profiles from seedlings and callus tissues (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013; Zupanska et al., 2013). The wild type used in this experiment was Col-0. This experiment found that approximately 300 genes were differentially regulated more than 2-fold in whole seedlings, and another approximately 300 in tissue culture samples (P < 0.01). However, in the case of seedlings alone, only 45 were differentially regulated 5-fold or more in spaceflight vs. ground control. BRIC-16-DNA compared their work with other experiments conducted in parabolic and simulated μg environments, and concluded that heat shock proteins (HSPs) were active only in prolonged spaceflight (Zupanska et al., 2013). In addition, Paul et al. (2012b) indicated that there were no differences in gross morphology between spaceflight-grown and ground control seedlings. Our BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton (BRIC-16-Cyt; J. Z. Kiss, Principal Investigator) studies focused on the structure of shoot statocytes and on the effects of spaceflight on plant gene expression. The wild type used in this study was Landsberg erecta (Ler-0). BRIC-16-Cyt reported a unidirectional skewing of roots and shoots was observed in μg compared with ground control plants, and adventitious roots were present in greater abundance in the spaceflight samples (Millar et al., 2011). Additionally, morphometric measurements of the endodermal cells in petioles of seedlings demonstrated a significant change in endodermal cell shape. Cells were more rounded in spaceflight vs. ground control, which was likely due to cell wall structural differences due to μg (Johnson et al., 2015). All three of these BRIC-16 experiments were run simultaneously in the same flight hardware, with differences in sample preparation, and all three generated transcriptome data using microarrays. BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-DNA used the Col-0 ecotype accession while BRIC-16-Cyt used Ler-0. Each of these groups grew seedlings on agar plates for 14 d, at which point seedlings were stabilized with RNAlater in-flight. Use of in-flight −80°C cold stowage for rapid freezing was unavailable for STS-131, so all samples were returned to Earth in RNAlater at ambient temperature. In this paper, we present comparative analyses of our BRIC-16-Cyt spaceflight experiment with the other two BRIC-16 experiments (BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-DNA). We demonstrate that even the same species grown in the same hardware can yield differing results due to specific experimental conditions including variations in genotypes, tissues used, and analytical techniques. These discrepancies led to a finding of little overlap among differentially regulated genes in these three spaceflight studies that used the same BRIC hardware system. However, transcripts within the same functional categories, including stress response, defense, auxin signaling, metabolic processes, and cell wall modification, were found to be common among these studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS The materials and methods for our BRIC-16-Cyt study are described in detail below. The materials and methods for the other experiments in BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-DNA are described briefly here as a comparison. Additional information regarding sample preparation is presented in Kwon et al. (2015) for BRIC-16-Reg and Paul et al. (2012b) for BRIC-16-DNA. Preflight preparation of BRIC-16-Cyt For the BRIC-16-Cyt experiment (J. Z. Kiss, Principal Investigator), seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (Ler-0) were surface-sterilized in a solution of 1 drop octyl phenol ethoxylate (TX-100) in 100 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min, followed by two, 1-min rinses in 95% (v/v) ethanol. An additional washing with 1 drop TX-100 in 100 mL water was followed by four final rinses in sterile water. Under sterile conditions within a laminar flow hood, seeds were sown in one row of 40 seeds on 13 total Petri plates (60 mm) on 1.2% (w/v) agar containing 1 mM MES buffer at pH 5.5, 1% (w/v) sucrose, one-half strength Murashige and Skoog basal salts (Millar et al., 2011). During the sowing process of the BRIC-16-Cyt seeds, the quality of each seed was assessed using a stereomicroscope and damaged seeds were discarded. Petri plates were sealed with Parafilm M (Bemis Company, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA), placed in a sealed sterile box then allowed 1 day incubation in darkness at a controlled 24°C before integration into the Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Unit (BRIC-PDFU) flight hardware (Kern et al., 1999; Millar et al., 2011). Integration of biological specimens into the flight hardware was conducted in sterile conditions within a laminar flow hood by engineering staff at the NASA Space Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL, Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA). Directionality of each PDFU was maintained as its fluid compartment was filled with 13 mL of RNAlater (Ambion, Foster City, California, USA). Each PDFU was then tested for leaks and placed within the external BRIC shell. The assembled BRIC-PDFUs were placed within a half-sized middeck locker on the Space Shuttle Discovery 36 h before launch (see Millar et al., 2011; Kwon et al., 2015; and Paul et al., 2012b for additional details on preparation of the BRIC-PDFU spaceflight hardware).Comparison of preflight preparation among the BRIC-16 investigative teams All three groups used the BRIC-PDFU flight hardware. BRIC-16-Cyt was conducted using the Ler-0 ecotype, while BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Reg used the Col-0 ecotype as the wild type. All plants were grown in the dark on 60 mm petri plates and on a similar agar substrate that included MS salts. Plates from both BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-Cyt were made up of 1.2% (w/v) agar with half-strength MS salts and 1% (w/v) sucrose. BRIC-16-DNA used 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel Arabidopsis Plate Media with half-strength MS salts (Paul et al., 2013; Schultz et al., 2012). Quantities of medium were equivalent for each group (6.5–6.7 mL per plate). While all seeds were sown before loading the hardware, the patterns in which they were sown were different. BRIC-16-DNA contained seeds sown in a grid pattern, with approximately 75 seeds per plate (Paul et al., 2012b; Schultz et al., 2012), while BRIC-16-Cyt seeds were sown in a dense line of 39–42 seeds across the center of each plate (see Millar et al., 2011), and BRIC-16-Reg plates contained 150–200 seeds in a series of lines for molecular studies (Kwon et al., 2015). Seeds for the BRIC-16-Cyt were wet-sown in nanopure water, while BRIC-16-Reg seeds were dry-sown from sterile filter paper following surface-sterilization (supplemental photo from Kwon et al., 2015). Thus, sowing techniques and substrates varied among the three investigative groups.Launch, landing, and sample processing For all of the BRIC-16 flight samples, stabilization in RNAlater was completed in-orbit by an astronaut after 309 h of growth of the plants in darkness in the BRIC-PDFU. Following landing and after 53 h in RNA later, the BRIC-16 samples were prepared for deintegration. The three BRIC-16 investigative teams followed this timeline. Petri plates then were removed from the flight hardware and the BRIC-16-Cyt plates with seedlings were photographed for gross morphology and germination analyses. BRIC-16-Cyt seedlings were placed in RNAse-free vials with fresh RNAlater and transported on ice to the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida (USA). Upon arrival at the university, microarray samples were placed in a freezer at −80°C for storage until extraction for RNA. Ground controls for all BRIC-16 samples were prepared in the same initial manner but with a 24-h delay from spaceflight samples. A ground control locker was placed within a growth chamber known as the orbital environmental simulator (OES) at the SLSL, which attempted to duplicate the temperature and humidity data collected from Discovery’s middeck, on a 24-h delay. The ground control locker was repositioned manually to mimic the directionality changes of the Shuttle’s launch sequence. Stabilization of all BRIC-16 samples was conducted in parallel to the process in-orbit, again on the same 24-h delay.Cell wall glycomics of BRIC-16-Cyt The cell wall glycomics analyses were performed at the University of Georgia Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC, Athens, GA). Tissue that remained in the shredder columns from the RNA extraction process from BRIC-16-Cyt samples were used to run an ELISA-based glycome analysis employing a comprehensive suite of plant cell wall glycan directed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Pattathil et al., 2012, 2015, 2016). This zero waste procedure allowed us to maximize the data produced from a minimal amount of spaceflight-grown tissue. Briefly, cell wall materials (alcohol insoluble residues; AIR) were isolated from ground and spaceflight grown plant tissues as described previously (Pattathil et al., 2012). Cell wall materials were subsequently subjected to a high alkaline extraction (4 M KOH with 1% w/v sodium borohydride) to extract most major noncellulosic cell wall glycans. The 4 M KOH extract was then neutralized, exhaustively dialyzed, and lyophilized for subsequent ELISA screens with the entire collection of cell-wall-glycan-directed mAbs (Pattathil et al., 2012). This process was extensively tested by CCRC staff with small quantities of Earth-grown Arabidopsis tissue samples before conducting these spaceflight studies, and their results were largely comparable to the results obtained with the BRIC-16-Cyt samples. Heat maps were produced using antibodies binding strength values obtained after ELISA screens (Pattathil et al., 2012). Cell walls were extracted from the shoot tissues to obtain a glycome profile, as explained above. ELISAs were performed with 0.3 μg glucose equivalent carbohydrate per-well basis in technical duplicates, and the presented data represent background-noise-subtracted means of the replicate assay. Cell-wall-glycan-directed mAbs were obtained from laboratory stocks (CCRC, JIM and MAC series) at the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (available through Carbo-Source Services; http://www.carbosource.net) and BG1 and LAMP (LAMP2HI2H7) were from BioSupplies (Yagoona, Australia). Cell wall glycomics analyses were not conducted by the other two BRIC-16 investigative teams.Microarray preparations for the BRIC-16-Cyt seedlings The contents of one BRIC from spaceflight (F) and two BRICs, each from a separate ground control (G), were set aside for the molecular component of the study. Each BRIC included five PDFUs (which contained one Petri plate). To clarify the sample size: each Petri plate was sown with 40 seeds, and germination rates were 89% for flight and 90% for ground Petri plates in the BRIC-16-Cyt study, providing a total of approximately 178 seedlings from spaceflight and 360 from ground control for molecular work. Of these, half of the seedlings harvested from four spaceflight PDFUs (79 seedlings) and nine ground control PDFUs (160 seedlings) were used for the microarray analyses. Samples were transferred to RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes containing fresh RNAlater for transportation. To process the BRIC-16-Cyt samples before the microarray studies, we thawed the samples and bisected them to separate roots from shoots. Tissues from shoots only were used for this study. Tissue of shoots was disrupted in a microcentrifuge tube using a Pellet Pestle motor (Kontes, Vineland, New Jersey, USA) and sterile RNase-free pestle tip (Stimpson et al., 2009). Extraction was conducted using the RNeasy Mini Plant Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the procedure outlined in the RNeasy Mini Handbook. The total RNA was provided to the University of Florida’s Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) Gene Expression Core Facility. There, sample was quantified using the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND-8000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, Delaware, USA), and quality was determined using the RNA 6000 Pico LabChip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) and its corresponding ladder (RNA 6000 ladder, Ambion, Foster City, California, USA) containing transcript sizes of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 6.0 kb on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Of the samples prepared, the three plates with the highest quality RNA were chosen from ground control and spaceflight to run the microarray in Appendix S1 (see the Supplemental Data with this article). RNA amplification and purification of BRIC-16-Cyt were conducted by the ICBR using the Ovation Pico WTA system for biotin target labeling. Chemical and enzymatic fragmentation of cRNA was completed in a thermal cycler at 37°C for 60 min, and 70°C for 10 min, with a final holding at 4°C until sample removal. The NanoDrop spectrophotometer was used to assess the yield of the labeled cRNA. Hybridization to the microarray gene chip was conducted following the standard protocol outlined in the technical manual for Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The BRIC-16-Cyt microarrays were washed and stained using the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 according to the Affymetrix standard protocol outlined in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis technical manual. Nonstringent wash buffer was used for washing. Streptavidin phycoerythrin (SAPE) was used for the staining process. Scanning was completed using the GeneChip Scanner 3000. Raw data were presented in the form of 570 nm light emission, the intensity of which is proportional to the number of targets bound at each locus of the array. Raw data from microarray studies was processed using Microarray Suite Version 5 software (Affymetrix) to convert the intensity information to quantitative values.Analyses of microarrays Raw microarray data were generated by each of the three investigative teams. The data obtained from BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-DNA were deposited in the ArrayExpress electronic database (Kolesnikov et al., 2015). BRIC-16-Reg can be found under the identifier E-MTAB-3011, while BRIC-16-DNA is identified as E-MTAB-1009. BRIC-16-Cyt data were deposited in the NASA GeneLab under accession number GLDS-121 (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-121/). For analysis of the raw microarray data from all three investigative teams (BRIC-16-Cyt, BRIC-16-Reg, and BRIC-16-DNA), the Expression Console (EC) software (Affymetrix) was used for normalization. For a point of comparison, three normalization methods were separately employed for all data sets: RMA (robust multi-array average), PLIER (probe logarithmic intensity error), and MAS5 (Affymetrix MicroArray Suite version 5) (Quackenbush, 2002; Irizarry et al., 2003; McClintick and Edenberg, 2006; Seo and Hoffman, 2006; Therneau and Ballman, 2008; Qu et al., 2010). Quality control tests were run on each normalized data set. Each normalized set was further processed by running gene-level unpaired one-way between subject ANOVA analyses using the Transcription Analysis Console (TAC) (Affymetrix) (Reis et al., 2015). Specifics of this workflow were described by Ode et al. (2014). Volcano plots were generated using Excel Professional Plus 2013 (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA). Hierarchical clustering of the BRIC-16-Cyt data was generated from the RMA-normalized BRIC-16-Cyt data using TAC. Gene Ontology (GO) data for each transcript was found using The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (Rhee et al., 2003). Graphs were generated showing that the main categories were molecular function, biological process, and cellular composition for the BRIC-16-Cyt data. Raw data for the other two investigative teams were obtained from EMBL: E-MTAB-3011 (BRIC-16-Reg) and E-MTAB-1009 (BRIC-16-DNA). For comparative transcriptomics, raw data sets from the three investigative groups (BRIC-16-Cyt, BRIC-16-Reg, BRIC-16-DNA) underwent QC testing using EC software and were processed separately using three normalization methods: MAS5, PLIER, and RMA. Normalized data sets then underwent unpaired one-way between-subject ANOVA analyses. Results of these analyses were augmented with TAIR GO data (Berardini et al., 2004), and genes were further annotated if linked to cell wall extractabilities by previous glycomics studies. To test the hypothesis that the observed transcriptomic differences among BRIC-16-Cyt, -Reg, and -DNA were due to experimental differences (and not random due to poor RNA or experimental error), we conducted a pairwise analysis of the ground controls from each experiment. Then, we performed a pairwise analysis of the spaceflight samples from each experiment. The data were then checked for overlap between the spaceflight and ground control. This process was repeated using each normalization method (RMA, MAS5, PLIER). To show that the number of stress genes was not abnormally high in the BRIC-16-Cyt samples as compared with the other investigative teams, we conducted a gene-level differential expression analysis: a one-way between-subject unpaired ANOVA to compare BRIC-16-Cyt ground controls with BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Reg ground control samples. The GO data were collected for the resulting gene lists and sorted.Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of BRIC-16-Cyt seedlings Shoots of seedlings from the BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton (BRIC-16-Cyt) group’s spaceflight-grown and ground control were also used for the qRT-PCR, and the following procedures took place at Miami University (Oxford, Ohio, USA). Seedlings were shipped overnight on dry ice from −80°C storage at the University of Florida and placed in −80°C storage upon arrival. Seedlings were defrosted, then dissected in RNAlater, disrupted using a pellet pestle motor and sterile pestle, and RNA was extracted from the shoots using the RNeasy Mini Plant Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA), according to the procedure outlined previously (Stimpson et al., 2009). Following extraction, excess fluid was evaporated using a centrifugal vacuum evaporator Savant Speed Vac Concentrator (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Evaporated RNA was re-eluted using RNase-free water and converted to cDNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). First, genomic DNA was removed by incubating RNA for 2 min with gDNA Wipeout Buffer in a 42°C water bath. Next, the samples underwent reverse transcription through incubation at 42°C with Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase, Qantiscript RT Buffer, and RT Primer mix, followed by inactivation of the process by placing them in a 95°C water bath for 3 min. A negative control was run alongside spaceflight and ground samples during the reverse transcription process. This negative control lacked reverse transcriptase, but contained all other reaction products. Real-time quantification of PCR was conducted to compare ground control and spaceflight samples using a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) and a Bio-Rad iCycler (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA) at Miami University’s Center for Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics, using the standard procedure outlined in the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Handbook. Primers for each gene of interest were designed using Primer 3 Plus (Untergasser, 2007; Untergasser et al., 2007; Thornton and Basu, 2011). Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 10 (UBC10; AT5G53300) was used as the standard. Primers are provided in Table 1. Incubation of cDNA with primers and SYBR Green Master Mix was conducted at 95°C for 15 min to activate the DNA polymerase and followed by 3-step cycling for 40 cycles. The cycles included a denaturing step for 15 s at 94 ° C, annealing for 30 s at 50 ° C, and extension at 72°C for 30 s A comparison of expression levels for each gene was conducted against our standard, UBC 10 (Stimpson et al., 2009), and negative controls— one that contained no reverse-transcriptase and one that lacked templates. Next, a melting curve analysis of the PCR products was conducted by plotting the results with the 2(−ΔΔCt) method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) to visualize the fold-change in RNA expression (also used by Paul et al. [2012b]). Resulting values of each were averaged, and the means were used to determine statistical significance using a Student’s t test in Excel. TABLE 1.

Cell wall materials isolated from these small sample amounts were subjected to a single-step strong alkaline extraction, an optimized method while working with trace amounts of starting tissue materials, to isolate most major noncellulosic matrix cell wall glycans. These extracts from ground and spaceflight samples were screened with a comprehensive suite of cell wall glycan-directed mAbs that could monitor most major noncellulosic glycan epitopes in plants. The results of this screening study are shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Comparative glycomics analyses of ground and spaceflight grown shoot samples of Arabidopsis thaliana. Cell-wall-glycan-directed mAbs-based ELISA screening of 4 M KOH cell wall extracts prepared from ground- and spaceflight-grown shoot samples of Arabidopsis thaliana was conducted to enable a comparative glycomics analysis. This comprehensive collection of 155 mAbs (labels in lower panel) used in the screen monitored most major classes of noncellulosic matrix cell wall glycans. The binding strengths of the mAbs that corresponded to the abundance of matrix glycan epitopes are depicted as a heatmap with a bright yellow to black color scheme in which bright yellow depicts the strongest binding and the black no binding.The results obtained showed that despite the small amounts of samples being used to start with, the 4 M KOH extraction step could recover significant abundance of matrix cell wall glycan epitopes for enabling mAb-based comparative glycomics studies. The most abundant epitopes detected in both sample types were nonfucosylated and fucosylated xyloglucan epitopes. However, interestingly, tissues from the spaceflight-grown samples reproducibly exhibited subtle differences from that of ground samples. For instance, the abundance of xylan epitopes was reduced in the spaceflight samples (those detected by xylan-3 through -7 groups of the mAbs), and similarly, the abundance of pectic backbone epitopes, including those recognized by homogalacturonan (HG) backbone-1, HG backbone 2, rhamnogalacturonan (RG)-I backbone, and RG-Ic groups of mAbs (Fig. 1) was marginally reduced in spaceflight-grown plants in comparison to the ground control. Overall, the results of the glycomics study of the BRIC-16-Cyt samples suggest that biosynthesis of xylan and pectic components of the walls may be impacted by microgravity, resulting in a compositional difference in the cell wall matrix. Table 2 outlines the genes involved in cell wall modification that are upregulated in spaceflight as determined by the BRIC-16-Cyt microarray, including the arabinogalactan protein AGP31 (AT1G28290), the xyloglucan XTH9 (AT4G03210), the glycosidase XTH32 (AT2G36870), and the glycosyl hydrolases GH9C2 (AT1G64390) and GH9B7 (AT1G75680) (Table 2).

The first indication of poor RNA quality was provided by the Bioanalyzer data (Appendix S1), which was further assessed with a QC threshold test. The QC threshold test confirmed that the microarray data were outside bounds for all three normalization methods conducted on BRIC-16-Cyt, with a percentage spread that was ≥10% among arrays. The BRIC-16-Reg group also noted poor RNA quality (Kwon et al., 2015) and was confirmed by a QC threshold test that was ≥10% among arrays. Raw data provided by the BRIC-16-DNA group also did not pass our QC threshold tests, as their percentage present spread was also ≥10% among arrays, and their log scale factor spread was high. Since sample sizes were limited and these spaceflight experiments could not readily undergo duplication, we continued with analyses of BRIC-16-Cyt based on the successful reporting of the BRIC-16-Reg (Kwon et al., 2015) and BRIC-16-DNA results (Paul et al., 2012b). BRIC-16-Cyt microarrays were normalized using three separate methods: RMA, MAS5, and PLIER. The BRIC-16-Cyt microarrays normalized using RMA showed that 126 transcripts were differentially expressed in spaceflight vs. ground control. Of these transcripts, 71 were upregulated while 55 were downregulated (−5 ≥ FC ≥ 5, P < 0.01). MAS5 analysis yielded 187 upregulated and 121 downregulated (−5 ≥ FC ≥ 5, P < 0.01), while PLIER analysis yielded the most, with 384 upregulated and 66 downregulated transcripts (−5 ≥ FC ≥ 5, P < 0.01) (Table 3). With all these methods, more were upregulated than downregulated overall (RMA data are displayed in Appendices S2 and S3). Of note, 71 transcripts were differentially regulated after all three normalization methods, but their fold-change values varied. Of these, only 37 transcripts were consistently upregulated, while only six were consistently downregulated among all three normalization techniques. Such differences in fold-change values among normalization methods are mentioned in the literature (Qu et al., 2010) and are to be expected. Many of the genes that were downregulated in spaceflight were annotated with gene ontology (GO) data (TAIR, 2017) for involvement in water stress response (Fig. 2). TABLE 3. Three normalization methods applied to the BRIC-16-Cyt microarray data. The number of differentially expressed genes in Space Flight/Ground Control (F/G) (P < 0.01) are listed.

Open in a new tab The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) Gene Ontology data showing (A1) upregulated cellular component, (A2) downregulated cellular component, (B1) upregulated biological process, (B2) downregulated biological process, and (C1) upregulated molecular function, (C2) downregulated molecular function for the BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton group. A comparison of Space Flight/Ground Control (F/G) with RMA-normalized data, −5 ≤ fold-change ≥ 5 (P < 0.01). The most downregulated biological process was response to stress. The nucleus was the most common cellular component localized for downregulated transcripts.GO cellular component data for our BRIC-16-Cyt experiments (Fig. 2A) indicated that most transcripts that were upregulated in spaceflight conditions were localized in the extracellular matrix, membranes, and the cell wall, while the majority of downregulated transcripts were localized in the nucleus. Biological process GO data (Fig. 2B) showed many upregulated transcripts were implicated in metabolic processes and transport, while the downregulated were often involved in stress response. GO molecular function data (Fig. 2C) indicated that the most upregulated transcripts were involved in enzyme activity, while the downregulated were implicated in some form of binding, including protein binding and DNA or RNA binding (Fig. 2C). GO data were used when identifying genes involved in hypoxia, heat shock response, cell wall organization, and water relations, as presented in the discussion. Hierarchical clustering of RMA-normalized BRIC-16-Cyt data showed that the transcriptomes of the flight samples clustered together, while the transcriptomes of the ground samples formed another distinct cluster. Within the genes, we found a clustering of dehydration-responsive genes that were downregulated including XERO1 (AT3G50980) and LTI78 (AT5G52310). Another cluster grouped the arabinogalactan protein FLA8 (aka AGP8; AT2G45470) with expansin expression, including EXPA4 (aka EXP4; AT2G39700) (Fig. 3). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Hierarchical clustering of BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton data, normalized using RMA: spaceflight vs. ground control; −5 ≤ fold-change ≥ 5 (P < 0.01). Downregulated transcripts (black) and upregulated transcripts (white) are shown on a grayscale gradient of black to white. DRT100 (AT3G12610) is a DNA damage repair protein that is downregulated in ground control. Water stress genes, including LTI78 (AT5G52310), XERO1 (AT3G50980), are clustered, and DREB2A (AT5G05410) are clustered as downregulated in spaceflight and upregulated in ground control. To produce this heat map and dendrogram, we calculated the Euclidean distance between expression vectors to determine the similarity between two genes. Cluster-to-cluster distances were determined by complete linkage.For cell-wall-modifying components in the BRIC-16-Cyt experiment, a number of genes were identified by all three normalization methods (RMA, MAS5, and PLIER) as differentially upregulated (F/G) 5-fold or more (P < 0.01) in the BRIC-16-Cyt study. These genes include AGP31 (AT1G28290), GH9C2 (AT1G64390), and XTH32 (AT2G36870). For xyloglucans specifically, genes that were differentially upregulated (F/G) 5-fold or more (P < 0.01) using one or more normalization method included: XTH32 (AT2G36870), XTH9 (AT4G03210), XTH8 (AT1G11545), XTH6 (AT5G65730), GH9A1 (AT5G49720), GH9B7 (AT1G75680), GH9B13 (AT4G02290), and GH9C2 (AT1G64390). Also, genes for some heat shock proteins were found to be differentially regulated 5-fold or more (P < 0.01), including the downregulated (F/G) HSP101 (AT1G74310) and HSP90.1 (AT5G52640), and HSP40 (AT2G20550), which was upregulated (F/G) in the BRIC-16-Cyt data. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the results of the microarray analysis. Four differentially regulated genes from the BRIC-16-Cyt microarray results: CCX2 (AT3G11490), XYL1 (AT1G68556), MYB2 (AT2G47190), EXPA10 (AT1G26770) were analyzed using qRT-PCR. The analysis showed that the expression of MYB2 was reduced in flight and EXPA10 was increased in flight, while CCX2 and XYL1 were unchanged. The results for unchanged genes are likely due to insufficient sample size, an unfortunate constraint of spaceflight studies. In the BRIC-16-Cyt microarray, MYB2 was downregulated, while EXPA10 was upregulated. These results show consistency between the two tests.Comparison of BRIC-16 spaceflight results Many studies that have been performed in spaceflight suggest that there is a stress response exhibited by plants (for reviews, see Musgrave, 2002; Paul et al., 2001; and Perbal, 2008). Thus, alterations in gene expression have been shown to occur between plants grown in spaceflight compared to ground controls. Here, we compared the results from three experiments that used the same hardware and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana during the same mission (STS-131), but had notable differences in sample preparation methodologies (Table 4).

Off-loading from the Space Shuttle and postprocessing were conducted at the same time and in a similar fashion for each group. Whole seedlings were analyzed by the BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Reg groups, while BRIC-16-Cyt dissected the seedlings before extraction, and we used only the shoots from seedlings for our molecular analyses. Extraction of RNA and the microarrays for BRIC-16-Cyt and BRIC-16-DNA were conducted by staff at the ICBR (Gainesville, Florida, USA) and by staff at the Noble Foundation (Ardmore, Oklahoma, USA) for BRIC-16-Reg. All three groups reported relatively poor quality RNA (Appendix S1; Kwon et al., 2015; Paul et al., 2012b). RNAlater was used by all three investigative groups to stabilize the RNA between the end of the experiment and the time of extraction. Each investigative team chose a normalization method for their microarray data that was suited to their specific data set. In our primary comparison of the three studies (Fig. 4), we used the same normalization method that was indicated by each group’s published methods. BRIC-16-Cyt and BRIC-16-Reg (Kwon et al., 2015) were normalized using RMA for the results presented here, while BRIC-16-DNA (Paul et al., 2012b) was normalized using MAS5. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Venn diagram showing a comparison of gene transcripts in a comparison of Space Flight/Ground Control (F/G) (downregulated and upregulated combined) in each study. BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton and BRIC-16-Regulation data were normalized using RMA, while BRIC-16-DNA microarrays were normalized using MAS5. For all groups, −5 ≤ fold-change ≥ 5 (P < 0.01). No transcripts were found in common among the three investigative teams. One transcript was in common between BRIC-16-Cyt and BRIC-16-DNA. Six transcripts were in common between BRIC-16-Cyt and BRIC-16-Reg.The comparison of these groups, presented in a Venn diagram (Fig. 4), was conducted using each group’s reported normalization method. No transcripts were found in common among all three groups using reported normalization methods, although one transcript was in common between BRIC-16-Cyt and BRIC-16-DNA (AT3G50980), and six were in common between BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-Cyt (Table 5), but these were upregulated in BRIC-16-Cyt and downregulated in BRIC-16-Reg. Overall, BRIC-16-Reg had more transcripts downregulated (Appendix S2), while BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Cyt saw more transcripts upregulated in spaceflight vs. ground control. An additional analysis was conducted on the raw data for the three groups using both normalization methods (Appendix S4). To confirm that our results were not obscured by experimental error, we conducted additional pairwise analyses between each groups’ ground controls and also between their spaceflight (not reported). The greatest similarities were found among the RMA data sets, with >8500 transcripts appearing in this pairwise comparison of 5-fold or more (P ≤ 0.01) in ground controls. This high level of overlap among the ground controls of the three investigative teams adds credibility to our results, indicating that the observed trends were not a product of experimental error.

In this comparison, 12% of the biological process GO terms of the BRIC-16-Cyt samples were categorized as response to stress, while only 5% of the GO terms of the combined BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Reg ground controls were categorized as response to stress. This series of comparisons indicates that more stress-response genes were present in the BRIC-16-Cyt ground controls compared with the other two investigative teams.DISCUSSION Here, we discuss the differences observed in the transcriptomes of the spaceflight studies, in relation to the environmental conditions of the spaceflight study. First, we consider changes in the cell wall during spaceflight, followed by convection as it relates to hypoxia in spaceflight, and then discuss the water status of plants in spaceflight. The emphasis is on the BRIC-16-Cyt results, but we compare our results with those of BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-DNA throughout. Changes in cell wall during spaceflight Cell wall integrity is important to a plant’s overall stability. In a recent report on our spaceflight studies, we showed that alterations in the cell wall occurred when seedlings were grown in spaceflight. Specifically, the individual endodermal cells were smaller and more rounded in spaceflight than in ground controls (Johnson et al., 2015). Transcriptomic data showed that a number of genes involved with cell wall (Table 2) and cytoskeletal structure (Table 6) were differentially regulated (F/G). AGP31 (AT1G28290) is an integral cell wall protein that is often abundant within etiolated hypocotyls, which acts as a scaffolding to strengthen the cell wall (Hijazi et al., 2014). AGP31 was found to be differentially upregulated (F/G, −5 ≥ FC ≥ 5, P < 0.01) in BRIC-16-Cyt. A difference in mechanical load in μg led to structural differences within the cell wall during a spaceflight study (Klymchuk et al., 2003). BRIC-16-Reg noted a similar trend and linked these differences to the actin cytoskeleton (Nakashima et al., 2014). TABLE 6.

BRIC-16-Cyt noted 7 differentially regulated genes relating to cytoskeleton within the shoots of seedlings grown in spaceflight (Table 6). These include four within the formin homology 2 (FH2) gene family, which are involved in cell elongation (Cao et al., 2015). Hemicelluloses such as xylans and xyloglucans are involved in the structural integrity of cell walls (Xiao et al., 2016). Cell wall components have previously been shown to be dependent on environmental growth conditions and are specific to each plant organ, with roots and leaves differing in composition in response to moisture availability (Pattathil et al., 2016). The glycomics results of our BRIC-16-Cyt study confirmed these previous studies, as they indicated that many xylan and pectic backbone epitopes were marginally less abundant in spaceflight-grown plants vs. ground control (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown the existence of xylan–pectin linkages in plant cell walls (Tan et al., 2013). These results suggest that the biosynthesis of such pectin–xylan networks may be altered in microgravity; however, further studies are advised. Xyloglucan-cleaving molecules were upregulated (F/G, −5 ≥ FC ≥ 5, P < 0.01) in BRIC-16-Cyt, including XTH32 (AT2G36870), XTH9 (AT4G03210), GH9C2 (AT1G64390), and GH9C2 (AT1G64390) (Table 2). These findings are in line with the results of several investigators (Hoson et al., 2002, 2003; Soga et al., 2002), who found that a breakdown of xyloglucan led to cell wall structural differences in spaceflight-grown hypocotyls. Taken together, the transcriptomic and glycomic results from this study also support the hypothesis that cell wall structural components differ between spaceflight-grown plants and ground controls.Convection issues and hypoxia during spaceflight Previous spaceflight studies have investigated the alteration of convection in μg (Porterfield et al., 1999) and determined that insufficient levels of oxygen, or hypoxia, were present in spaceflight-grown plants (Stout et al., 2001; Liao et al., 2004). Altered air circulation was also a factor in this study, as evidenced by differences in temperature among BRICs (Millar et al., 2011; Paul et al., 2012b). This hypoxic condition impacts the sugar and starch content of the plant, with differences among the stems, leaves, and roots (Porterfield et al., 1997). BRIC-16-Cyt and BRIC-16-Reg showed differentially regulated genes with GO data that indicated a hypoxic response. These are HSFA2 and PLA2A. HSFA2 (AT2G26150) was found to be differentially regulated in BRIC-16-Cyt, and PLA2A (AT2G26560) was differentially regulated in our analysis of BRIC-16-Reg. Both of these genes were downregulated (F/G, −5 ≥ FC ≥ 5, P < 0.01) in these studies, which indicates that in this hardware, hypoxia was less of an issue for spaceflight-grown plants than for their ground control equivalents. In flooded or otherwise hypoxic environments, plants develop adventitious roots, which immediately transport oxygen from the substrate to shoots (Ayi et al., 2016). Interestingly, in BRIC-16-Cyt, we observed an abundance of adventitious roots growing from the shoots of spaceflight samples (Millar et al., 2011). Thus, this abundance of adventitious roots could account for the reduction in shoot hypoxia. Water and gas distribution within μg is unreliable (Hoehn et al., 2000; Stout et al., 2001); yet when water is accessible to the roots, it can travel to the rest of the plant body via capillary motion (Saint-Jalmes et al., 2007). Rounder cells observed in the shoot endodermis of spaceflight-grown seedlings (Johnson et al., 2015) may be accounted for by a higher turgor potential in the shoots along with the observed cell wall structural differences. An earlier spaceflight study noted increased turgor through vacuolation of soybean root cells (Klymchuk et al., 2003). In contrast to roots, shoot statocytes contain a large vacuole when grown in 1 g, and the vacuole pushes against the cell wall. Because roots have smaller vacuoles than shoots, alterations in gas convection and fluid dynamics that are unique to μg can impact them differently. The difference in the mechanical load of water in μg has been linked to structural and compositional differences within the cell wall (Chebli et al., 2013). This trend is further supported by the glycomic results of the BRIC-16-Cyt shoots, which indicate a decrease in the abundance of xylan, rhamnogalacturonan, and homogalacturonan epitopes in spaceflight vs. ground control (Fig. 1) and differences observed in cell shape (Johnson et al., 2015).Water status in spaceflight A striking abundance of genes related to water stress were highly differentially upregulated in ground control vs. spaceflight for BRIC-16-Cyt (Table 5; Appendices S2 and S4). An additional comparison of ground controls of all three spaceflight experiments indicated the relative absence of stress-response genes in the ground controls. Taken together, these results suggest that there was less water stress in spaceflight than there was on Earth. Interestingly, a water-stress-responsive transcript, XERO1, was downregulated (F/G) in both the BRIC-16-Cyt and BRIC-16-DNA studies. XERO1 (RAB18/LEA34) is a dehydrin, a late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein, that has been implicated in the freezing tolerance of seeds during dormancy (Hundertmark et al., 2011; Mäntylä et al., 1995) and was implicated in tissue-specific response to water deficit (Nylander et al., 2001). Like many stress-response genes, XERO1 was shown to be responsive to abscisic acid (Lång and Palva, 1992; Ghelis et al., 2000a) and dependent on calcium influx (Ghelis et al., 2000b) for activity. While many genes associated with stress response were differentially regulated in the three studies that we compared, BRIC-16-Cyt had much higher absolute (log2)-fold change values than BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-DNA. The BRIC-16-Cyt study included transcriptomic analyses on shoots alone. The BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-DNA studies used complete seedlings for their transcriptome analysis. BRIC-16-DNA also used callus tissue samples, but the transcriptomes were not compared in the present analysis. In a spaceflight experiment using the ABRS hardware, Paul et al. (2013) explained the importance of separating plant organs rather than using entire seedlings for transcriptomics studies. They showed that Arabidopsis underwent organ-specific changes in response to spaceflight, with differential gene expression in leaves, hypocotyls, and roots under each condition. When organs were pooled together they provided an incomplete picture, even having a gene be oppositely regulated in different organs grown under the same conditions (Paul et al., 2013). This observation explains the comparatively high FC values with downregulation of stress-response genes in the BRIC-16-Cyt results. These results also suggest that roots may undergo greater hypoxic stress than shoots during spaceflight. Since there were abundant adventitious roots observed on the hypocotyls of spaceflight seedlings compared with ground controls, some of the differences in expression profiles may be accounted for by including root tissues (Millar et al., 2011).CONCLUSIONS During our analyses of the literature on spaceflight experiments, we noted that many studies conducted on different types of organisms reported on stress responses (Barrila et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017), cell expansion (Jha et al., 2016; Soga et al., 2002), cellular defense (Matía et al., 2007; Martzivanou et al., 2006), and cell polarity (Lorenzi and Perbal, 1990; Testa et al., 2014). The three BRIC-16 experiments (BRIC-16-Cyt, BRIC-16-Reg, and BRIC-16-DNA) also found many genes in these categories to be differentially regulated in Arabidopsis, with contrasting results in entire seedlings compared with shoots. By addressing the data of three similar experiments in one spaceflight project, we acquired detailed information regarding the Arabidopsis transcriptome in microgravity. However, we noted similarities and differences in the microarray data among the three BRIC-16 studies. Minor differences in methodologies could account for the dissimilarities that we observed among the three data sets, with data analytics accounting for the majority of these differences. In addition, it is important to again note that we used shoot tissue only in our BRIC-16-Cyt studies, while the other two groups used entire seedlings. Overall, the results from this comparison support previous findings that stress response pathways and cell wall structure are altered in spaceflight. The current study was aided by the close collaboration of three investigative groups, who participated in an experiment using identical hardware in the BRIC-16 project during the STS-131 mission of the Space Shuttle. Sharing raw data among investigative teams studying Arabidopsis has become common due to large open data sets accessible through TAIR and similar databases. In an effort to maximize collaborations, NASA has built an open bioinformatics-driven platform entitled GeneLab (Alwood et al., 2017), which brings together NASA space life science research-omics data from the diverse research programs of ISS and NASA. GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov) will facilitate additional bioinformatics analyses of diverse spaceflight studies to help improve our understanding of how plants and other biological systems respond to the challenges of spaceflight.Supplementary Material S1 MS926549-supplement-S1.pdf (1.9MB, pdf) S2 MS926549-supplement-S2.pdf (1.2MB, pdf) S3 MS926549-supplement-S3.pdf (1.3MB, pdf) S4 MS926549-supplement-S4.pdf (928.3KB, pdf) Acknowledgments The authors thank the anonymous reviewers and the editors of the American Journal of Botany for their additional insights and suggestions to improve this manuscript.

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Traveling to nearby extraterrestrial objects having a reduced gravity level (partial gravity) compared to Earth’s gravity is becoming a realistic objective for space agencies. The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions. Materials and Methods: Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-g, several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 h. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using the GEDI tool, gene networks and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment. Results: Differential gene expression analysis revealed only one differentially expressed gene (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar protein) across all gravity conditions using FDR correction (q < 0.05). However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro-g, low-g level (< 0.1g) or the Moon g-level with 1g control conditions. Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes was similar in microgravity and the Moon g-level and increased in the intermediate g-level (< 0.1g), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at each g-level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low-g, and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon g-level. Discussion: Transcriptional analyses of plants under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism in microgravity. Competition among tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro-g level, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms.

    "introduction": "Introduction Long-term exploration of the Solar System will require that humans travel within a nearly close life-support systems, reducing to the minimum the amount of water, oxygen, and nutrients to be transported and optimizing the recycling of reusable waste. Such a system is being under development, for example, in the Melissa project from the European Space Agency (Godia et al., 2004), but it will require an edible plant to be successfully cultivated in the environmental conditions expected to be achieved during spaceflight and on arrival at nearby objects. Isolation chambers could avoid, at least partially, some of the suboptimal environmental conditions that can greatly compromise organism adaptation to spaceflight (Beckingham, 2010), including temperature, radiation, air, and soil composition constrains. However, providing artificial gravity will require large diameter centrifuge (Van Loon et al., 2008) or even expensive railroad-based platforms that could be subjected to other biological limitations. Gravity influences the direction of plant growth and the pattern of development, from seedlings to adult plants (Volkmann and Baluska, 2006), and even gravitational effects on in vitro plant cell cultures have been reported (Babbick et al., 2007; Barjaktarovic et al., 2007). Light is the only tropistic response that plays a substantial role in determining overall plant architecture with a contribution similar to gravity. Typically, plants orient their roots towards the gravity vector (positive gravitropic response), and away from blue/white light exposure (negative phototropic response). Shoots show the opposite orientation, growing away from the gravity vector (negative gravitropic response) and towards a blue/white light source (positive phototropic response; Kutschera and Briggs, 2016; Briggs, 2014; Chen et al., 1999). Any tropistic response is divided into three stages; perception, transduction and response. During the perception phase, starch-filled statoliths interact with other cellular components in the specialized columella cells. Once the gravity signal is perceived, a differential auxin gradient develops along the root to the root elongation zone (transduction stage), where differential plant growth occurs and leads to reorientation of the root in the direction of the gravity vector (reviewed in Vandenbrink et al., 2014). Phototropism and gravitropism have been well characterized, but little was known about the interaction among tropisms until recently. Experiments with plants in microgravity have allowed for the study of phototropism in the absence of the influence of gravity (Kiss, 2015). Our previous research showed that light perception by the roots can have an effect on shoot gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana (Hopkins and Kiss, 2012). In addition, phototropic curvature of roots in response to unilateral blue light was tied to the magnitude of the gravity vector (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). This latter study also identified an association between red-light-based phototropism in roots and the magnitude of the gravity vector. Other experiments involving assays of cell growth and cell proliferation have demonstrated that there is an imbalance between these key plant development functions in microgravity (Matía et al., 2010) in dark-grown plants. Recent spaceflight results also demonstrated that red light can compensate this effect (Valbuena et al., 2018), particularly increasing cell growth (i.e., as assayed by ribosome biosynthesis in the nucleolus) that was depleted without light stimulation. Studies on the response of living organisms to altered gravity are greatly facilitated by the development of ground-based facilities for simulation of gravity alterations to perform basic science as well as to design and prepare for space experiments (Herranz et al., 2013). The biological system (cell proliferation and growth during early plant development) had previously been studied under real microgravity in the ISS (Driss-Ecole et al., 2008; Matía et al., 2010; Mazars et al., 2014). Similar effects to the ones observed during spaceflight (increased cell proliferation rates together with decreased cell growth parameters) also were observed in root meristem cells in simulated microgravity studies (Bouchern-Dubuisson et al., 2016; Valbuena et al., 2018) and in two partial-g paradigms. The imbalance of the cell proliferation and cell growth rates is also observable at the Moon´s gravity level, while less pronounced effects were observed at Mars g level (Kamal et al., 2018; Manzano et al., 2018). In terms of spaceflight transcriptional experiments, a number of studies performed in orbit are available in public databases (Paul et al., 2012; Paul et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2017; Zupanska et al., 2017). In these studies, some Gene Ontology categories as responses to biotic or abiotic stress, oxidative stress, cell wall reorganization and secondary metabolism remodeling commonly show the highest variation in gene expression. Transcriptional response in microgravity is different in each experiment, due to both the biological material (developmental stage or organ analyzed) and the technical/environmental constraints of each spaceflight experiment [late or early access to the sample during spaceflight, the hardware used, type of dissection/fixation/preservation see for example (Kruse et al., 2017)]. In a previous report, we focused on the effects of microgravity in the transcriptional profile of blue-light photostimulated seedlings (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). Here, we will describe the plant transcriptional response to several partial gravity levels in young blue-light photostimulated A. thaliana seedlings cultivated into the European Module Cultivation System (EMCS) centrifuge on board the International Space Station (ISS). The results from plants cultivated on the ISS within the SEEDLING GROWTH experiment series illustrate the adaptation strategy of plants at the level of the whole transcriptome to cope with reduced gravity conditions.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Seedling Growth Spaceflight Experiments Seeds of A. thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler) were flown to the ISS via the SpaceX Dragon. Spaceflight experiments were conducted utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus Module of the ISS. The EMCS facility provides two centrifuges for creation of simulated gravity vectors, as well as atmospheric, temperature and hydration monitoring and control (Brinckmann and Schiller, 2002; Brinckmann, 2005; Kiss et al., 2014). In addition, the EMCS contains a video camera for image acquisition as well as monitoring of growth. The Seedling Growth series of experiments was conducted in two parts. The first set of seedlings were uploaded on SpaceX CRS-2 (March 2013) followed by return via CRS-3 (May 2014), and the second set of seedlings were carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (February 2015). Spaceflight Procedures Experimental containers were uploaded to the ISS and loaded into the EMCS as previously described (Kiss et al., 2014; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016; Vandenbrink et al., 2019). Experimental conditions were controlled remotely from the Norwegian User Support and Operations Centre (N-USOC; Trondheim, Norway). The experiment was initiated via hydration of the seeds. Plants were grown under 6 nominal gravity conditions produced by different rotational speeds on the EMCS centrifuge, microgravity (stopped EMCS centrifuge), 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 g. The angular speed to generate each fractional gravity level was calculated for the cassette in the center of the Experimental Container. In the case of the 1.0 g cassettes, the value was calculated for the fifth cassette in order to prevent values higher than Earth nominal gravity. Seedlings were illuminated under white light (30–40 µmol m−2 s−1) for 96 h, followed by 48 h of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light. Light sources were LEDs (Kiss et al., 2014). RNA-Seq analysis was only conducted on seedlings exposed to unidirectional blue light. After conclusion of the experiments, seedlings were frozen in dedicated holders by placing them at -80°C in the General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIER) freezer of the ISS. Upon return of frozen seedlings to Earth, samples were transported on dry ice and immediately preserved with RNALater for subsequent RNA-Seq analysis. RNA Extraction and Sequencing RNA was extracted individually for each EC TROPI cassette for most of the samples (i.e. from 24 cassettes, 20 samples were obtained to collect approximately 10–15 seedlings per extraction). A plant specific RNA extraction NucleoSpin kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Catalog # 740949.250) including a DNase treatment was used to isolate whole plant mRNA. The quantity and quality of the extracted RNA was determined by Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). Extracted RNA was keep frozen at −80 C until shipped on dry ice to the David H. Murdoch Research Institute in Kannapolis; North Carolina, USA. During sequencing, twenty total RNA samples were used to generate twenty sequencing libraries using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA). Samples were individually indexed. The samples then were combined at equimolar proportions into three pools with 6–7 samples per pool. Each pool was loaded onto a single lane of a flow cell. A 125bp paired end sequencing run was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500. Paired-end 125bp reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis TAIR10 genomes using the HISAT2 pipeline on the Clemson University Palmetto Cluster (Kim et al., 2015). Fragments with a Phred score below 33 were filtered using Trimmomatic (Trimmomatic, 2013). HISAT2 (v2.1.0) was used to align sequencing reads. Reads were assembled into transcripts using StringTie (v1.3.4). Annotation was conducted using TAIR10 FASTA sequence the TAIR10 genome GTF annotation file (www.arabidopsis.org). This transcriptional dataset has been submitted to the GENELAB database (https://genelab.nasa.gov) and it will be released with the reference GLDS-251. Differential Gene Expression Analysis Statistical analyses of differential gene expression was conducted utilizing DESeq2 (v1.18.1; Anders and Huber, 2010). A multiple-test corrected p-value (q-value; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) of 0.05 was employed. The 20 samples were organized to reduce the g-level interval within biological replicates so the following groups were established: microgravity (stopped EMCS centrifuge, 4 replicates), low gravity (0.09 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates), Moon gravity (0.18 ± 0.04g, 3 replicates), Mars gravity (0.36 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates), reduced Earth gravity (0.57 ± 0.05g, 4 replicates) and 1g control (0.99 ± 0.06g, 3 replicates). Venn Diagrams comparing the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) across gravity levels were created using jvenn [http://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/index.html (Bardou et al., 2014)] with both q-value < 0.05 and p-value < 0.05. Afterwards, gene ontology (GO) analysis of specific groups of DEGs was performed using BinGO (Maere et al., 2005) with the full list of GO terms (GO_Full) or using PANTHER (Mi et al., 2019) with the molecular functions, biological process and cellular component GO lists. Subcellular localization of DEGs was analyzed using the abundance tool (MMAP) of the Subcellular Localization Database for Arabidopsis Proteins [SUBA4, (Hooper et al., 2017)]. For a global view of the whole genome transcriptional status along g-levels into the SG1 and SG2 experiment (comparisons versus 1g), global expression patterns were calculated using the Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector (GEDI v2.1) program analysis (Eichler et al., 2003). GEDI profile allows the visualization of the gene expression across the transcriptome generating a mosaic image or dot matrix, consisting of 5 x 9 pixels (average of 5–14 probe sets/tile) using a self-organizing map algorithm and standard setting of the software (Eichler et al., 2003). Analysis was done using the signal log2 ratio of the selected probe sets through using the 5,571 probes with any significant (p < 0.05) change in expression from more than 21,000 sequences assignated to annotated genes. The same study was repeated adding the false discovery rate correction (FDR, q < 0.05, 861 genes). Each pixel represents a group or cluster of genes that share a similar transcriptional profile in any experimental condition. Each pixel has a color which reflects the average expression of the genes included in the cluster for each experimental condition compared to 1g control in each panel. The GEDI program SOM algorithm determines which genes should be assigned to each cluster, and then places similar clusters in a nearby area of the mosaic, creating an image and allowing global transcriptome analysis as a single entity for display in different gravitational conditions. For certain pixels of interest, the gene list extracted from the clusters was used to find functional links between genes using Genemania App embedded into the Cytoscape v3.6.1 (Shannon et al., 2003) software with default settings.",
    "results": "Results Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) We performed transcriptomic studies with young seedlings of A. thaliana that were grown on the ISS at different gravity levels depending on the rotational speed of the EMCS centrifuge (nominal g levels) and the distance of each cassette to the rotation center (Figure 1). Seeds were hydrated to initiate our spaceflight experiment as previously described (Kiss, 2015; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2019) showing a positive blue-light phototropism in the microgravity samples that it is greatly reduced at 0.1g, and effectively negated at 0.3g and higher gravity levels (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Root growth was also determined after blue-light stimulation. The results show longer roots in microgravity and 1g samples in comparison with 0.1g seedlings (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Setup of SG1/SG2 experiment on board the International Space Station. (A) Image of an experimental container with 5 seedling cassettes inside the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) with the direction to the EMCS rotor center included. (B) Calculated g-level in each of the five culture chambers depending on the distance to the EMCS centrifuge rotor (note that only samples in the 3 positions in bold were included in this analysis, cassettes at 174 and 206 mm from EMCS center did not contain wildtype samples) and different EMCS rotational speed (nominal g value). Different background grey tones are used to indicate the samples that were used as replicates for low gravity (0.09 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates), Moon gravity (0.18 ± 0.04g, 3 replicates), Mars gravity (0.36 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates) and reduced Earth gravity (0.57 ± 0.05g, 4 replicates) and 1g control (0.99 ± 0.06g, 3 replicates) in addition to the microgravity samples (stopped centrifuge, 4 replicates). (C) Closer view of 6 day-old seedlings growing within a seed cassette at microgravity (CC116), low g (0.07g, CC136), Moon g (0.21g, CC156) or 1g control (1.05g, CC175) conditions with blue light stimulation (from the left). Hypocotyls show a clear positive phototropism at any g-level but roots only show this tropism at microgravity (arrows). For comparison, seed cassettes at low g (0.07g, CC126) and 1g control (1.05g, CC165) conditions exhibiting root positive phototropism to red light stimulation (from the left) are provided (see Vandenbrink et al., 2016 for a detailed phototropism discussion).Differential expression analysis was conducted via DESeq2 (Anders and Huber, 2010) among all five reduced gravity conditions taking into account the calculated g-level experienced in each EC due to the geometry of the EMCS container (Figure 1B), using Earth’s gravity (1g) as the reference group, extending previous results from the microgravity samples (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). Initially, a reduced stringency analysis was done to isolate all genes identified as differentially expressed with a p-value of p < 0.05. Comparison between µg and 1g revealed 2067 differentially expressed genes, comparisons between low gravity (lower than 0.1g) and 1g peaked at 2552 genes, comparisons between Moon g-level and 1g reduced to 2088 genes, comparisons between Mars g-level and 1g revealed 978 genes, and lastly, comparisons between reduced Earth g-level (0.57g) and 1g identified only 411 differentially expressed genes (Figure 2A). In addition to an uncorrected p-value of p < 0.05, a stringent Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) FDR q-value <0.05 was used in the identification of differentially expressed genes (Figure 2B). Comparison between µg and 1g revealed 296 differentially expressed genes, while fractional gravity comparisons between low gravity (lower than 0.1g) and 1g revealed 568 genes. Comparisons between Moon g-level and 1g revealed 123 genes and comparisons between Mars g-level and 1g revealed 19 genes. Lastly, comparisons between reduced Earth g-level (0.57g) and 1g identified only 2 differentially expressed genes. Only one DEG appeared in all reduced gravity conditions (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar protein sorting homolog gene), another in all but reduced Earth g level (AT5G45428). There were 12 common DEG in microgravity, low g and Moon g conditions, being most of them related with calcium signaling, redox status and stress response (Supplementary Table 1). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across the different gravity levels. (A) Venn diagram classifying DEGs using uncorrected p-value (p < 0.05). (B) Venn diagram classifying DEGs including an adjusted FDR q-value (p and q < 0.05). (C) Ten most significant gene ontology (BinGO GO Full Enrichment) categories from DEG in µg vs. 1g only (FDR q < 0.05). (D) Ten most significant gene ontology (BinGO GO Full Enrichment) categories from DEG in low gravity (circa 0.1g) vs. 1g only (FDR q < 0.05). (E) Ten most significant gene ontology (BinGO GO Full Enrichment) categories from DEG in Moon gravity vs. 1g only (FDR q < 0.05).The ten most significant GO terms (BinGO full GO terms list) of the genes differentially expressed (obtained with the adjusted q-value in Figure 2B) specifically expressed in µg, low-g, or Moon gravity only were identified (Figures 2C–E). Not only the number of significantly affected genes, but also the type of genes affected, were clearly different with the increasing partial g level. In microgravity, we observed an enrichment in GO terms related with light and photosynthesis. In low gravity, there was a quite global stress effect together with chemical and hormone responses. Finally, when plants are grown under the Moon gravity level, the more representative enrichment is related to cell wall and membrane structure and function related genes. In fact, the differential subcellular localization of the DEGs at the Moon g level shows a clear enrichment in plastid related genes and other cell wall/membrane systems, while the general stress response observed at the low g level is characterized by the very large unassigned Subcellular compartment group (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 2). Partial Gravity Differential Effect Although the effects of partial-g on gene expression (at the levels of the Moon or Mars) appeared limited in the first analysis (Figure 2), we then evaluated how the expression recovers to normal values from microgravity to 1g condition by using a visual tool that creates a mosaic image for each g-level representing the gene expression level of similarly behaving DEG (in at least one of the conditions, n = 5571, p < 0.05 without FDR correction, Figure 3 first row). Except in the case of the low g condition, it is clear that the areas in red (up-regulated gene clusters) and the areas in blue (down-regulated genes clusters) that appear in the microgravity panels became quantitative and qualitatively smaller with increasing g-level. In the case of the low g condition, different clusters and with greater expression changes appears, suggesting an overlapping of two different responses at <0.1g level. The same result is shown if we apply the FDR correction (n = 861, p < 0.05 and q < 0.05 FDR correction, Figure 3 second row). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Whole-genome transcriptional status variations along g-levels into the SG1/SG2 experiments (comparisons versus 1g). A 5x9 clustering analysis of the differentially expressed genes (in at least one of the partial g levels, using normal p values (first row, n = 5,571 genes) or adjusted q-values (second row, n = 861 genes) on the transcriptome have been done with the average of each gene expression level within a similarly expressed cluster across the samples. Values are shown according to the log2 ratio scales at the border of the figure (from highly overrepresented in red to highly down-represented in blue). The mean value of −0.3 or −0.7 indicates an overall repression in gene expression under microgravity. The gene density maps are shown in the middle of the figure for each analysis. Calculated g-levels have been obtained by considering replicates the more similar samples across the nominal µg, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g and 1g (precisely, µg (4 replicates), 0.09 ± 0.02g (3 replicates), Moon level (0.18 ± 0.04g, 3 replicates), Mars-level (0.36 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates), 0.57 ± 0.05g (4 replicates) and control 1g (0.99 ± 0.06g, 3 replicates).Additionally, we took advantage of the GEDI self-organizing maps to select the list of commonly upregulated genes due to reduced gravity from the clusters in the first row of the GEDI panels. When the list of obtained genes (Supplementary Table 3) is used as a query in GeneMANIA, a tool to create networks from gene database content, a putative pathway for gravity response is proposed. Several processes related to mitochondria, plastid, cell wall and cell membrane processes are clearly affected together with 4 proteins (out of 156 annotated in the genome) belonging to the F-box/RMI-like/FDB-like domain family (including members as TIR-1 auxin signaling gene, cell wall remodeling and even cyclins, Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Fifteen up-regulated genes in reduced gravity conditions can be connected in a gravity-response putative pathway. Large circles shown the genes detected in the first row clusters from the previous GEDI analysis (Figure 3) and small circles are candidates to be members of a shared pathway (as detected by Genemania App in Cytoscape v3.6.1). While most of the genes have unknown function, color have been used to highlight shared features among their GO properties. Solid lines shown related features as detected by Genemania app, dotted lines have been added by manual datamining comparisons. Note that four genes expressing F-box/RMI-like proteins (in red) out of 156 genes (related examples are auxin polar transport genes as TIR-1, cell wall remodeling and even cyclins) in the genome may be key in the definition of a microgravity specific pathway characterized by the highly interconnected nodes in this graph.Finally, in an attempt to further dissect the differential response to partial gravity, we analyzed separately the up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs (Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 2). We can observe a general pattern in which the number of DEG fades with increasing g level but with a remarkable exception. In the list of down-regulated DEGs without FDR correction there is an unusually high number of affected genes in both low g and Moon g level (not shown). These DEGs are more clearly confirmed only in low g after FDR correction, in which more than 50% of the non-corrected DEG remains significant after the FDR correction. These genes belong to stress related GO terms, particularly related with the accessibility to plant nutrients (Figure 5). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Biological processes affected by reduced gravity (Panther Enrichment in biological process GO). Total number of up-regulated and down-regulated DEG (p < 0.05) are shown for the five reduced gravity conditions vs. 1g control.

    "discussion": "Discussion Blue Light Phototropism May Be Enough to Reduce the Gravitational Stress Response on Orbit Image analysis of seedlings grown during the Seedling Growth suite of experiments previously characterized a novel blue-light phototropic response in roots of A. thaliana grown in conditions of microgravity (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). This relationship was shown to be linearly related to the magnitude of the gravity vector for plants exposed to red light, but plants exposed to blue light showed rapid attenuation of the response in the presence of increasing gravity levels. To determine the differential response to reduced gravity and attempt to dissect the molecular mechanisms of gravisensing, we performed RNA-seq analysis to characterize changes in gene expression that may be associated with the novel blue phototropic response. Interestingly, the effect of blue-light illumination is clearly observable in the microgravity samples, with a clear enrichment in GO terms related with light perception, photosynthesis and biosynthesis of the photosynthetic complexes as previously reported (Vandenbrink et al., 2019), but it is barely appearing in the GO enrichment analyses that we performed on partial gravity samples, even bellow 0.1g (low g conditions). Surprisingly, the phototropic response to the blue light seems to be enough to cancel the effects of other genes of interest in gravitational research (as the ones observed at low g or Moon g level) to be not significantly affected in microgravity conditions. This result may be complementing previous reports from the same Seedling Growth spaceflight experiment but with plants exposed to red photostimulation. Fundamental plant functions, as cell proliferation and cell growth activity in root meristems, known to be affected by microgravity in the absence of light (Matía et al., 2010) are balanced just by providing a red photostimulation phase (Valbuena et al., 2018). In both red and blue photostimulation samples within the Seedling Growth experiment, roots are exhibiting a positive phototropism that can compensate the gravitropism stimuli role that it is required to preserve meristematic competence in orbit, as shown by the longer root growth in microgravity and 1g samples in comparison with 0.1g seedlings (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Low-g Effect: Competition Between Tropisms or Artifacts of Reduced-Gravity Simulation? The large number of DEGs detected in the low-g conditions (<0.1g) is a striking result of this study. The type of transcriptional response observed in this group is similar to stress-related responses reported in other spaceflight or simulated microgravity datasets (Paul et al., 2012; Correll et al., 2013; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Paul et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Zupanska et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). In this case, there is a very clear component of “Response to General Stress” with a FDR q value <10−10, without any other GO terms to be similarly affected. In contrast the responses at the microgravity level (FDR q value <10−6), or at the Moon g-level (FDR q value <10−2) are very subtle. We explain these results as being the consequence of the combination of two tropistic responses acting with very low intensity. It is very likely that the subtle blue phototropism and the weak gravitropism signal at approximately 0.09g are competing to take the leading role in providing the fundamental cue for driving seedling growth and plant development. The result is a stress for the plant (blue-LEDS are located laterally while the gravity vector is towards the bottom of the cassette), which needs to adapt its developmental plan to an environment without the usual tropistic cues. The transcriptional adaptation to provide a response to this evolutionary novel and challenging environment requires the modification of more than five hundred genes, while microgravity only requires half of this number. An alternative explanation to the low-g effects that cannot be completely excluded could be put in connection with simulated microgravity experiments. Secondary effects of microgravity simulation facilities (shear or inertial forces) and even small variations in the environmental conditions of experimental and control samples may lead to gene expression variations in a similar set of genes as those observed in the low-g subgroup in this work. Similarly, it is important to take into account the existence of hardware effects when growing plants in real microgravity (Kiss, 2015), including lack of convection, reduced CO2 levels, improper temperature, elevated ethylene, spacecraft vibrations, increased radiation exposure, among others. However, the tropism conflict interpretation introduced early on this section seems to have a greater contribution than the artifacts of centrifugation in the low-g effects. A hardware side-effect explanation is less conceivable since the present study was conducted utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System, which contains an air scrubbing/filtration system designed for removing excess ethylene from the seedlings during the growth phase (Kiss et al., 2014; Kiss, 2015). Thus, even with proper ventilation, a reduction in gene expression of photosynthetic genes was observed in the microgravity samples (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). In the case of the samples exposed to centrifugation, the ventilation effect should be less important, but the centrifugation by itself could lead to additional stress in the samples. However, this centrifugation factor is also present in the 1g control sample, exposed to even higher angular speeds. Spaceflight experimentation is required to verify that simulation strategies on Earth analogues are reliable and worthy. The continuous validation of the best simulation strategies will optimize and increase our chances of success in future spaceflight experiments (Herranz et al., 2013). Additional research in simulated low-g conditions on Earth or even in the Moon surface will help to extend and validate this research work. Moon and Mars-g Effects and the Consequences for Manned Spaceflight Missions Cultivating plants as part of life support systems in nearby objects of our planet will require us to expose the plants to the partial-g interval within the two values we examined here, namely, Moon g-level (0.18 ± 0.04g) and Mars gravity (0.36 ± 0.02g). Although some of the genes and GO terms observed affected at lower g-levels also appeared in these conditions, the existence of the gravitropic response, in combination with blue light illumination, seems to be enough to restore a nearly normal transcriptional state, particularly at the Mars g-level. These results are consistent with previous data coming from partial gravity simulation paradigms that validated that Arabidopsis developmental plan is still affected at the Moon g-level (even more intensely affected than in similar simulated microgravity samples) but that the “normal” developmental plan is almost completely restored at Mars g-levels (Kamal et al., 2018; Manzano et al., 2018). The identity of some of the GO terms significantly affected at the Moon g-level suggest some structural stress at the level of the cell wall and membrane systems. This result is consistent with other results in spaceflight experiments (Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Zupanska et al., 2017). This effect is progressively weaker from Moon-g (almost similar to microgravity) to Mars-g, which shows a less intense response, but it is still visible at g-levels as high as 0.57g, when utilizing the less stringent analysis (Figure 2A). At these g-levels, gravitropism response may be acting and suppressing the recently described blue-light root phototropism, (already at the Moon g-level, see Figure 1C). Therefore, we suggest that this transcriptional response could be related with the graviresistance signal that the cells without professional gravisensing organelles (as the statolith in the columella cells of the root) may use to detect g-force (Soga, 2013). Particularly at the Moon g-level, the very weak gravitropic signal may be still in conflict with a graviresistance tension in the cell wall and membrane systems (also weak), inducing and additional stress that is progressively removed when Mars g-level is reached. In that regard, we have found that some of the genes changing throughout the series of reduced gravity levels can be connected in a pathway in which certain genes may have a central position (Figure 4). The most connected nodes in the pathway would be the genes involved in the cross-talk between the cell-membrane-localized (AT3G44430 and AT2G34840) and the F-box/RMI-like/FDB-like domain proteins (AT5G56370 and AT5G56380) candidate genes. An important caveat to our results is that RNA was obtained from whole seedlings, despite our assumption that the root is the organ that can discriminate better the weak phototropism and gravitropism signals that are proposed here to be responsible of the transcriptional variations we have shown here.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions The results of this study take advantage of the induction of subtle blue-light phototropism in roots in spaceflight to discern the transcriptional responses to different tropisms in orbit. Removal of the influence of gravity on blue-light-illuminated seedlings showed a reduction in gene expression in multiple pathways associated with photosynthesis, suggesting shared molecular pathways between the two tropistic responses, or a functional compensation among them. It is important to emphasize that the effects shown at microgravity here are gradually removed by increasing g-load. While the phototropic effect is noted at the microgravity level, a general stress response is detected at <0.1g, probably due to conflicting stimuli, just at the detection threshold of photo- and gravi-sensing mechanisms. Membrane-related gene ontologies became the more significant at the Moon g-level, and they become progressively weaker at higher g-levels, allowing us to discriminate the differential contribution of the classical statolith-based gravitropism from other responses based on cell tensegrity that may require a higher g-threshold to be fully active (Hoson et al., 2005; Hoson and Wakabayashi, 2015). Therefore, our results are starting to isolate, at the whole transcriptional level, the global effects that are produced by the gravitropism, phototropism and graviresistance mechanisms, working at different g-level thresholds. Future use of mutant lines will help us to confirm and extend these findings, which suggests an intricate connection between gravity and light perception in A. thaliana. In the long term, these results on the interaction among tropisms will be important for the use of plants in bioregenerative support systems needed for the human exploration of the Solar System.",

Copyright notice ID: 6889863 PMID: 31850027 Abstract Introduction: Traveling to nearby extraterrestrial objects having a reduced gravity level (partial gravity) compared to Earth’s gravity is becoming a realistic objective for space agencies. The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions. Materials and Methods: Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-g, several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 h. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using the GEDI tool, gene networks and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment. Results: Differential gene expression analysis revealed only one differentially expressed gene (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar protein) across all gravity conditions using FDR correction (q < 0.05). However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro-g, low-g level (< 0.1g) or the Moon g-level with 1g control conditions. Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes was similar in microgravity and the Moon g-level and increased in the intermediate g-level (< 0.1g), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at each g-level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low-g, and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon g-level. Discussion: Transcriptional analyses of plants under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism in microgravity. Competition among tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro-g level, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms. Keywords: Arabidopsis, fractional gravity, microgravity, stress response, RNA-Seq, spaceflightIntroduction Long-term exploration of the Solar System will require that humans travel within a nearly close life-support systems, reducing to the minimum the amount of water, oxygen, and nutrients to be transported and optimizing the recycling of reusable waste. Such a system is being under development, for example, in the Melissa project from the European Space Agency (Godia et al., 2004), but it will require an edible plant to be successfully cultivated in the environmental conditions expected to be achieved during spaceflight and on arrival at nearby objects. Isolation chambers could avoid, at least partially, some of the suboptimal environmental conditions that can greatly compromise organism adaptation to spaceflight (Beckingham, 2010), including temperature, radiation, air, and soil composition constrains. However, providing artificial gravity will require large diameter centrifuge (Van Loon et al., 2008) or even expensive railroad-based platforms that could be subjected to other biological limitations. Gravity influences the direction of plant growth and the pattern of development, from seedlings to adult plants (Volkmann and Baluska, 2006), and even gravitational effects on in vitro plant cell cultures have been reported (Babbick et al., 2007; Barjaktarovic et al., 2007). Light is the only tropistic response that plays a substantial role in determining overall plant architecture with a contribution similar to gravity. Typically, plants orient their roots towards the gravity vector (positive gravitropic response), and away from blue/white light exposure (negative phototropic response). Shoots show the opposite orientation, growing away from the gravity vector (negative gravitropic response) and towards a blue/white light source (positive phototropic response; Kutschera and Briggs, 2016; Briggs, 2014; Chen et al., 1999). Any tropistic response is divided into three stages; perception, transduction and response. During the perception phase, starch-filled statoliths interact with other cellular components in the specialized columella cells. Once the gravity signal is perceived, a differential auxin gradient develops along the root to the root elongation zone (transduction stage), where differential plant growth occurs and leads to reorientation of the root in the direction of the gravity vector (reviewed in Vandenbrink et al., 2014). Phototropism and gravitropism have been well characterized, but little was known about the interaction among tropisms until recently. Experiments with plants in microgravity have allowed for the study of phototropism in the absence of the influence of gravity (Kiss, 2015). Our previous research showed that light perception by the roots can have an effect on shoot gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana (Hopkins and Kiss, 2012). In addition, phototropic curvature of roots in response to unilateral blue light was tied to the magnitude of the gravity vector (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). This latter study also identified an association between red-light-based phototropism in roots and the magnitude of the gravity vector. Other experiments involving assays of cell growth and cell proliferation have demonstrated that there is an imbalance between these key plant development functions in microgravity (Matía et al., 2010) in dark-grown plants. Recent spaceflight results also demonstrated that red light can compensate this effect (Valbuena et al., 2018), particularly increasing cell growth (i.e., as assayed by ribosome biosynthesis in the nucleolus) that was depleted without light stimulation. Studies on the response of living organisms to altered gravity are greatly facilitated by the development of ground-based facilities for simulation of gravity alterations to perform basic science as well as to design and prepare for space experiments (Herranz et al., 2013). The biological system (cell proliferation and growth during early plant development) had previously been studied under real microgravity in the ISS (Driss-Ecole et al., 2008; Matía et al., 2010; Mazars et al., 2014). Similar effects to the ones observed during spaceflight (increased cell proliferation rates together with decreased cell growth parameters) also were observed in root meristem cells in simulated microgravity studies (Bouchern-Dubuisson et al., 2016; Valbuena et al., 2018) and in two partial-g paradigms. The imbalance of the cell proliferation and cell growth rates is also observable at the Moon´s gravity level, while less pronounced effects were observed at Mars g level (Kamal et al., 2018; Manzano et al., 2018). In terms of spaceflight transcriptional experiments, a number of studies performed in orbit are available in public databases (Paul et al., 2012; Paul et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2017; Zupanska et al., 2017). In these studies, some Gene Ontology categories as responses to biotic or abiotic stress, oxidative stress, cell wall reorganization and secondary metabolism remodeling commonly show the highest variation in gene expression. Transcriptional response in microgravity is different in each experiment, due to both the biological material (developmental stage or organ analyzed) and the technical/environmental constraints of each spaceflight experiment [late or early access to the sample during spaceflight, the hardware used, type of dissection/fixation/preservation see for example (Kruse et al., 2017)]. In a previous report, we focused on the effects of microgravity in the transcriptional profile of blue-light photostimulated seedlings (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). Here, we will describe the plant transcriptional response to several partial gravity levels in young blue-light photostimulated A. thaliana seedlings cultivated into the European Module Cultivation System (EMCS) centrifuge on board the International Space Station (ISS). The results from plants cultivated on the ISS within the SEEDLING GROWTH experiment series illustrate the adaptation strategy of plants at the level of the whole transcriptome to cope with reduced gravity conditions.Materials and Methods Seedling Growth Spaceflight Experiments Seeds of A. thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler) were flown to the ISS via the SpaceX Dragon. Spaceflight experiments were conducted utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus Module of the ISS. The EMCS facility provides two centrifuges for creation of simulated gravity vectors, as well as atmospheric, temperature and hydration monitoring and control (Brinckmann and Schiller, 2002; Brinckmann, 2005; Kiss et al., 2014). In addition, the EMCS contains a video camera for image acquisition as well as monitoring of growth. The Seedling Growth series of experiments was conducted in two parts. The first set of seedlings were uploaded on SpaceX CRS-2 (March 2013) followed by return via CRS-3 (May 2014), and the second set of seedlings were carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (February 2015).Spaceflight Procedures Experimental containers were uploaded to the ISS and loaded into the EMCS as previously described (Kiss et al., 2014; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016; Vandenbrink et al., 2019). Experimental conditions were controlled remotely from the Norwegian User Support and Operations Centre (N-USOC; Trondheim, Norway). The experiment was initiated via hydration of the seeds. Plants were grown under 6 nominal gravity conditions produced by different rotational speeds on the EMCS centrifuge, microgravity (stopped EMCS centrifuge), 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 g. The angular speed to generate each fractional gravity level was calculated for the cassette in the center of the Experimental Container. In the case of the 1.0 g cassettes, the value was calculated for the fifth cassette in order to prevent values higher than Earth nominal gravity. Seedlings were illuminated under white light (30–40 µmol m−2 s−1) for 96 h, followed by 48 h of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light. Light sources were LEDs (Kiss et al., 2014). RNA-Seq analysis was only conducted on seedlings exposed to unidirectional blue light. After conclusion of the experiments, seedlings were frozen in dedicated holders by placing them at -80°C in the General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIER) freezer of the ISS. Upon return of frozen seedlings to Earth, samples were transported on dry ice and immediately preserved with RNALater for subsequent RNA-Seq analysis.RNA Extraction and Sequencing RNA was extracted individually for each EC TROPI cassette for most of the samples (i.e. from 24 cassettes, 20 samples were obtained to collect approximately 10–15 seedlings per extraction). A plant specific RNA extraction NucleoSpin kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Catalog # 740949.250) including a DNase treatment was used to isolate whole plant mRNA. The quantity and quality of the extracted RNA was determined by Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). Extracted RNA was keep frozen at −80 C until shipped on dry ice to the David H. Murdoch Research Institute in Kannapolis; North Carolina, USA. During sequencing, twenty total RNA samples were used to generate twenty sequencing libraries using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA). Samples were individually indexed. The samples then were combined at equimolar proportions into three pools with 6–7 samples per pool. Each pool was loaded onto a single lane of a flow cell. A 125bp paired end sequencing run was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500. Paired-end 125bp reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis TAIR10 genomes using the HISAT2 pipeline on the Clemson University Palmetto Cluster (Kim et al., 2015). Fragments with a Phred score below 33 were filtered using Trimmomatic (Trimmomatic, 2013). HISAT2 (v2.1.0) was used to align sequencing reads. Reads were assembled into transcripts using StringTie (v1.3.4). Annotation was conducted using TAIR10 FASTA sequence the TAIR10 genome GTF annotation file (www.arabidopsis.org). This transcriptional dataset has been submitted to the GENELAB database (https://genelab.nasa.gov) and it will be released with the reference GLDS-251.Differential Gene Expression Analysis Statistical analyses of differential gene expression was conducted utilizing DESeq2 (v1.18.1; Anders and Huber, 2010). A multiple-test corrected p-value (q-value; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) of 0.05 was employed. The 20 samples were organized to reduce the g-level interval within biological replicates so the following groups were established: microgravity (stopped EMCS centrifuge, 4 replicates), low gravity (0.09 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates), Moon gravity (0.18 ± 0.04g, 3 replicates), Mars gravity (0.36 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates), reduced Earth gravity (0.57 ± 0.05g, 4 replicates) and 1g control (0.99 ± 0.06g, 3 replicates). Venn Diagrams comparing the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) across gravity levels were created using jvenn [http://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/index.html (Bardou et al., 2014)] with both q-value < 0.05 and p-value < 0.05. Afterwards, gene ontology (GO) analysis of specific groups of DEGs was performed using BinGO (Maere et al., 2005) with the full list of GO terms (GO_Full) or using PANTHER (Mi et al., 2019) with the molecular functions, biological process and cellular component GO lists. Subcellular localization of DEGs was analyzed using the abundance tool (MMAP) of the Subcellular Localization Database for Arabidopsis Proteins [SUBA4, (Hooper et al., 2017)]. For a global view of the whole genome transcriptional status along g-levels into the SG1 and SG2 experiment (comparisons versus 1g), global expression patterns were calculated using the Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector (GEDI v2.1) program analysis (Eichler et al., 2003). GEDI profile allows the visualization of the gene expression across the transcriptome generating a mosaic image or dot matrix, consisting of 5 x 9 pixels (average of 5–14 probe sets/tile) using a self-organizing map algorithm and standard setting of the software (Eichler et al., 2003). Analysis was done using the signal log2 ratio of the selected probe sets through using the 5,571 probes with any significant (p < 0.05) change in expression from more than 21,000 sequences assignated to annotated genes. The same study was repeated adding the false discovery rate correction (FDR, q < 0.05, 861 genes). Each pixel represents a group or cluster of genes that share a similar transcriptional profile in any experimental condition. Each pixel has a color which reflects the average expression of the genes included in the cluster for each experimental condition compared to 1g control in each panel. The GEDI program SOM algorithm determines which genes should be assigned to each cluster, and then places similar clusters in a nearby area of the mosaic, creating an image and allowing global transcriptome analysis as a single entity for display in different gravitational conditions. For certain pixels of interest, the gene list extracted from the clusters was used to find functional links between genes using Genemania App embedded into the Cytoscape v3.6.1 (Shannon et al., 2003) software with default settings.Results Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) We performed transcriptomic studies with young seedlings of A. thaliana that were grown on the ISS at different gravity levels depending on the rotational speed of the EMCS centrifuge (nominal g levels) and the distance of each cassette to the rotation center (Figure 1). Seeds were hydrated to initiate our spaceflight experiment as previously described (Kiss, 2015; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2019) showing a positive blue-light phototropism in the microgravity samples that it is greatly reduced at 0.1g, and effectively negated at 0.3g and higher gravity levels (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Root growth was also determined after blue-light stimulation. The results show longer roots in microgravity and 1g samples in comparison with 0.1g seedlings (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Setup of SG1/SG2 experiment on board the International Space Station. (A) Image of an experimental container with 5 seedling cassettes inside the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) with the direction to the EMCS rotor center included. (B) Calculated g-level in each of the five culture chambers depending on the distance to the EMCS centrifuge rotor (note that only samples in the 3 positions in bold were included in this analysis, cassettes at 174 and 206 mm from EMCS center did not contain wildtype samples) and different EMCS rotational speed (nominal g value). Different background grey tones are used to indicate the samples that were used as replicates for low gravity (0.09 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates), Moon gravity (0.18 ± 0.04g, 3 replicates), Mars gravity (0.36 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates) and reduced Earth gravity (0.57 ± 0.05g, 4 replicates) and 1g control (0.99 ± 0.06g, 3 replicates) in addition to the microgravity samples (stopped centrifuge, 4 replicates). (C) Closer view of 6 day-old seedlings growing within a seed cassette at microgravity (CC116), low g (0.07g, CC136), Moon g (0.21g, CC156) or 1g control (1.05g, CC175) conditions with blue light stimulation (from the left). Hypocotyls show a clear positive phototropism at any g-level but roots only show this tropism at microgravity (arrows). For comparison, seed cassettes at low g (0.07g, CC126) and 1g control (1.05g, CC165) conditions exhibiting root positive phototropism to red light stimulation (from the left) are provided (see Vandenbrink et al., 2016 for a detailed phototropism discussion).Differential expression analysis was conducted via DESeq2 (Anders and Huber, 2010) among all five reduced gravity conditions taking into account the calculated g-level experienced in each EC due to the geometry of the EMCS container (Figure 1B), using Earth’s gravity (1g) as the reference group, extending previous results from the microgravity samples (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). Initially, a reduced stringency analysis was done to isolate all genes identified as differentially expressed with a p-value of p < 0.05. Comparison between µg and 1g revealed 2067 differentially expressed genes, comparisons between low gravity (lower than 0.1g) and 1g peaked at 2552 genes, comparisons between Moon g-level and 1g reduced to 2088 genes, comparisons between Mars g-level and 1g revealed 978 genes, and lastly, comparisons between reduced Earth g-level (0.57g) and 1g identified only 411 differentially expressed genes (Figure 2A). In addition to an uncorrected p-value of p < 0.05, a stringent Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) FDR q-value <0.05 was used in the identification of differentially expressed genes (Figure 2B). Comparison between µg and 1g revealed 296 differentially expressed genes, while fractional gravity comparisons between low gravity (lower than 0.1g) and 1g revealed 568 genes. Comparisons between Moon g-level and 1g revealed 123 genes and comparisons between Mars g-level and 1g revealed 19 genes. Lastly, comparisons between reduced Earth g-level (0.57g) and 1g identified only 2 differentially expressed genes. Only one DEG appeared in all reduced gravity conditions (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar protein sorting homolog gene), another in all but reduced Earth g level (AT5G45428). There were 12 common DEG in microgravity, low g and Moon g conditions, being most of them related with calcium signaling, redox status and stress response (Supplementary Table 1). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across the different gravity levels. (A) Venn diagram classifying DEGs using uncorrected p-value (p < 0.05). (B) Venn diagram classifying DEGs including an adjusted FDR q-value (p and q < 0.05). (C) Ten most significant gene ontology (BinGO GO Full Enrichment) categories from DEG in µg vs. 1g only (FDR q < 0.05). (D) Ten most significant gene ontology (BinGO GO Full Enrichment) categories from DEG in low gravity (circa 0.1g) vs. 1g only (FDR q < 0.05). (E) Ten most significant gene ontology (BinGO GO Full Enrichment) categories from DEG in Moon gravity vs. 1g only (FDR q < 0.05).The ten most significant GO terms (BinGO full GO terms list) of the genes differentially expressed (obtained with the adjusted q-value in Figure 2B) specifically expressed in µg, low-g, or Moon gravity only were identified (Figures 2C–E). Not only the number of significantly affected genes, but also the type of genes affected, were clearly different with the increasing partial g level. In microgravity, we observed an enrichment in GO terms related with light and photosynthesis. In low gravity, there was a quite global stress effect together with chemical and hormone responses. Finally, when plants are grown under the Moon gravity level, the more representative enrichment is related to cell wall and membrane structure and function related genes. In fact, the differential subcellular localization of the DEGs at the Moon g level shows a clear enrichment in plastid related genes and other cell wall/membrane systems, while the general stress response observed at the low g level is characterized by the very large unassigned Subcellular compartment group (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 2).Partial Gravity Differential Effect Although the effects of partial-g on gene expression (at the levels of the Moon or Mars) appeared limited in the first analysis (Figure 2), we then evaluated how the expression recovers to normal values from microgravity to 1g condition by using a visual tool that creates a mosaic image for each g-level representing the gene expression level of similarly behaving DEG (in at least one of the conditions, n = 5571, p < 0.05 without FDR correction, Figure 3 first row). Except in the case of the low g condition, it is clear that the areas in red (up-regulated gene clusters) and the areas in blue (down-regulated genes clusters) that appear in the microgravity panels became quantitative and qualitatively smaller with increasing g-level. In the case of the low g condition, different clusters and with greater expression changes appears, suggesting an overlapping of two different responses at <0.1g level. The same result is shown if we apply the FDR correction (n = 861, p < 0.05 and q < 0.05 FDR correction, Figure 3 second row). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Whole-genome transcriptional status variations along g-levels into the SG1/SG2 experiments (comparisons versus 1g). A 5x9 clustering analysis of the differentially expressed genes (in at least one of the partial g levels, using normal p values (first row, n = 5,571 genes) or adjusted q-values (second row, n = 861 genes) on the transcriptome have been done with the average of each gene expression level within a similarly expressed cluster across the samples. Values are shown according to the log2 ratio scales at the border of the figure (from highly overrepresented in red to highly down-represented in blue). The mean value of −0.3 or −0.7 indicates an overall repression in gene expression under microgravity. The gene density maps are shown in the middle of the figure for each analysis. Calculated g-levels have been obtained by considering replicates the more similar samples across the nominal µg, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g and 1g (precisely, µg (4 replicates), 0.09 ± 0.02g (3 replicates), Moon level (0.18 ± 0.04g, 3 replicates), Mars-level (0.36 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates), 0.57 ± 0.05g (4 replicates) and control 1g (0.99 ± 0.06g, 3 replicates).Additionally, we took advantage of the GEDI self-organizing maps to select the list of commonly upregulated genes due to reduced gravity from the clusters in the first row of the GEDI panels. When the list of obtained genes (Supplementary Table 3) is used as a query in GeneMANIA, a tool to create networks from gene database content, a putative pathway for gravity response is proposed. Several processes related to mitochondria, plastid, cell wall and cell membrane processes are clearly affected together with 4 proteins (out of 156 annotated in the genome) belonging to the F-box/RMI-like/FDB-like domain family (including members as TIR-1 auxin signaling gene, cell wall remodeling and even cyclins, Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Fifteen up-regulated genes in reduced gravity conditions can be connected in a gravity-response putative pathway. Large circles shown the genes detected in the first row clusters from the previous GEDI analysis (Figure 3) and small circles are candidates to be members of a shared pathway (as detected by Genemania App in Cytoscape v3.6.1). While most of the genes have unknown function, color have been used to highlight shared features among their GO properties. Solid lines shown related features as detected by Genemania app, dotted lines have been added by manual datamining comparisons. Note that four genes expressing F-box/RMI-like proteins (in red) out of 156 genes (related examples are auxin polar transport genes as TIR-1, cell wall remodeling and even cyclins) in the genome may be key in the definition of a microgravity specific pathway characterized by the highly interconnected nodes in this graph.Finally, in an attempt to further dissect the differential response to partial gravity, we analyzed separately the up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs (Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 2). We can observe a general pattern in which the number of DEG fades with increasing g level but with a remarkable exception. In the list of down-regulated DEGs without FDR correction there is an unusually high number of affected genes in both low g and Moon g level (not shown). These DEGs are more clearly confirmed only in low g after FDR correction, in which more than 50% of the non-corrected DEG remains significant after the FDR correction. These genes belong to stress related GO terms, particularly related with the accessibility to plant nutrients (Figure 5). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Biological processes affected by reduced gravity (Panther Enrichment in biological process GO). Total number of up-regulated and down-regulated DEG (p < 0.05) are shown for the five reduced gravity conditions vs. 1g control. The ten most significant gene ontology (Panther biological process GO Enrichment) categories for the three upregulated and the three downregulated DEGs are shown for the microgravity, low gravity (circa 0.1g) and Moon gravity (0.18g) vs. 1g (*** FDR q < 0.001, **FDR q < 0.01, *FDR q > 0.05).Discussion Blue Light Phototropism May Be Enough to Reduce the Gravitational Stress Response on Orbit Image analysis of seedlings grown during the Seedling Growth suite of experiments previously characterized a novel blue-light phototropic response in roots of A. thaliana grown in conditions of microgravity (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). This relationship was shown to be linearly related to the magnitude of the gravity vector for plants exposed to red light, but plants exposed to blue light showed rapid attenuation of the response in the presence of increasing gravity levels. To determine the differential response to reduced gravity and attempt to dissect the molecular mechanisms of gravisensing, we performed RNA-seq analysis to characterize changes in gene expression that may be associated with the novel blue phototropic response. Interestingly, the effect of blue-light illumination is clearly observable in the microgravity samples, with a clear enrichment in GO terms related with light perception, photosynthesis and biosynthesis of the photosynthetic complexes as previously reported (Vandenbrink et al., 2019), but it is barely appearing in the GO enrichment analyses that we performed on partial gravity samples, even bellow 0.1g (low g conditions). Surprisingly, the phototropic response to the blue light seems to be enough to cancel the effects of other genes of interest in gravitational research (as the ones observed at low g or Moon g level) to be not significantly affected in microgravity conditions. This result may be complementing previous reports from the same Seedling Growth spaceflight experiment but with plants exposed to red photostimulation. Fundamental plant functions, as cell proliferation and cell growth activity in root meristems, known to be affected by microgravity in the absence of light (Matía et al., 2010) are balanced just by providing a red photostimulation phase (Valbuena et al., 2018). In both red and blue photostimulation samples within the Seedling Growth experiment, roots are exhibiting a positive phototropism that can compensate the gravitropism stimuli role that it is required to preserve meristematic competence in orbit, as shown by the longer root growth in microgravity and 1g samples in comparison with 0.1g seedlings (Vandenbrink et al., 2016).Low-g Effect: Competition Between Tropisms or Artifacts of Reduced-Gravity Simulation? The large number of DEGs detected in the low-g conditions (<0.1g) is a striking result of this study. The type of transcriptional response observed in this group is similar to stress-related responses reported in other spaceflight or simulated microgravity datasets (Paul et al., 2012; Correll et al., 2013; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Paul et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Zupanska et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). In this case, there is a very clear component of “Response to General Stress” with a FDR q value <10−10, without any other GO terms to be similarly affected. In contrast the responses at the microgravity level (FDR q value <10−6), or at the Moon g-level (FDR q value <10−2) are very subtle. We explain these results as being the consequence of the combination of two tropistic responses acting with very low intensity. It is very likely that the subtle blue phototropism and the weak gravitropism signal at approximately 0.09g are competing to take the leading role in providing the fundamental cue for driving seedling growth and plant development. The result is a stress for the plant (blue-LEDS are located laterally while the gravity vector is towards the bottom of the cassette), which needs to adapt its developmental plan to an environment without the usual tropistic cues. The transcriptional adaptation to provide a response to this evolutionary novel and challenging environment requires the modification of more than five hundred genes, while microgravity only requires half of this number. An alternative explanation to the low-g effects that cannot be completely excluded could be put in connection with simulated microgravity experiments. Secondary effects of microgravity simulation facilities (shear or inertial forces) and even small variations in the environmental conditions of experimental and control samples may lead to gene expression variations in a similar set of genes as those observed in the low-g subgroup in this work. Similarly, it is important to take into account the existence of hardware effects when growing plants in real microgravity (Kiss, 2015), including lack of convection, reduced CO2 levels, improper temperature, elevated ethylene, spacecraft vibrations, increased radiation exposure, among others. However, the tropism conflict interpretation introduced early on this section seems to have a greater contribution than the artifacts of centrifugation in the low-g effects. A hardware side-effect explanation is less conceivable since the present study was conducted utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System, which contains an air scrubbing/filtration system designed for removing excess ethylene from the seedlings during the growth phase (Kiss et al., 2014; Kiss, 2015). Thus, even with proper ventilation, a reduction in gene expression of photosynthetic genes was observed in the microgravity samples (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). In the case of the samples exposed to centrifugation, the ventilation effect should be less important, but the centrifugation by itself could lead to additional stress in the samples. However, this centrifugation factor is also present in the 1g control sample, exposed to even higher angular speeds. Spaceflight experimentation is required to verify that simulation strategies on Earth analogues are reliable and worthy. The continuous validation of the best simulation strategies will optimize and increase our chances of success in future spaceflight experiments (Herranz et al., 2013). Additional research in simulated low-g conditions on Earth or even in the Moon surface will help to extend and validate this research work.Moon and Mars-g Effects and the Consequences for Manned Spaceflight Missions Cultivating plants as part of life support systems in nearby objects of our planet will require us to expose the plants to the partial-g interval within the two values we examined here, namely, Moon g-level (0.18 ± 0.04g) and Mars gravity (0.36 ± 0.02g). Although some of the genes and GO terms observed affected at lower g-levels also appeared in these conditions, the existence of the gravitropic response, in combination with blue light illumination, seems to be enough to restore a nearly normal transcriptional state, particularly at the Mars g-level. These results are consistent with previous data coming from partial gravity simulation paradigms that validated that Arabidopsis developmental plan is still affected at the Moon g-level (even more intensely affected than in similar simulated microgravity samples) but that the “normal” developmental plan is almost completely restored at Mars g-levels (Kamal et al., 2018; Manzano et al., 2018). The identity of some of the GO terms significantly affected at the Moon g-level suggest some structural stress at the level of the cell wall and membrane systems. This result is consistent with other results in spaceflight experiments (Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Zupanska et al., 2017). This effect is progressively weaker from Moon-g (almost similar to microgravity) to Mars-g, which shows a less intense response, but it is still visible at g-levels as high as 0.57g, when utilizing the less stringent analysis (Figure 2A). At these g-levels, gravitropism response may be acting and suppressing the recently described blue-light root phototropism, (already at the Moon g-level, see Figure 1C). Therefore, we suggest that this transcriptional response could be related with the graviresistance signal that the cells without professional gravisensing organelles (as the statolith in the columella cells of the root) may use to detect g-force (Soga, 2013). Particularly at the Moon g-level, the very weak gravitropic signal may be still in conflict with a graviresistance tension in the cell wall and membrane systems (also weak), inducing and additional stress that is progressively removed when Mars g-level is reached. In that regard, we have found that some of the genes changing throughout the series of reduced gravity levels can be connected in a pathway in which certain genes may have a central position (Figure 4). The most connected nodes in the pathway would be the genes involved in the cross-talk between the cell-membrane-localized (AT3G44430 and AT2G34840) and the F-box/RMI-like/FDB-like domain proteins (AT5G56370 and AT5G56380) candidate genes. An important caveat to our results is that RNA was obtained from whole seedlings, despite our assumption that the root is the organ that can discriminate better the weak phototropism and gravitropism signals that are proposed here to be responsible of the transcriptional variations we have shown here.Conclusions The results of this study take advantage of the induction of subtle blue-light phototropism in roots in spaceflight to discern the transcriptional responses to different tropisms in orbit. Removal of the influence of gravity on blue-light-illuminated seedlings showed a reduction in gene expression in multiple pathways associated with photosynthesis, suggesting shared molecular pathways between the two tropistic responses, or a functional compensation among them. It is important to emphasize that the effects shown at microgravity here are gradually removed by increasing g-load. While the phototropic effect is noted at the microgravity level, a general stress response is detected at <0.1g, probably due to conflicting stimuli, just at the detection threshold of photo- and gravi-sensing mechanisms. Membrane-related gene ontologies became the more significant at the Moon g-level, and they become progressively weaker at higher g-levels, allowing us to discriminate the differential contribution of the classical statolith-based gravitropism from other responses based on cell tensegrity that may require a higher g-threshold to be fully active (Hoson et al., 2005; Hoson and Wakabayashi, 2015). Therefore, our results are starting to isolate, at the whole transcriptional level, the global effects that are produced by the gravitropism, phototropism and graviresistance mechanisms, working at different g-level thresholds. Future use of mutant lines will help us to confirm and extend these findings, which suggests an intricate connection between gravity and light perception in A. thaliana. In the long term, these results on the interaction among tropisms will be important for the use of plants in bioregenerative support systems needed for the human exploration of the Solar System.Data Availability Statement The datasets generated for this study can be found in the GeneLab database https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-251/.Author Contributions RH and JV designed this partial gravity experiment within the Seedling Growth and wrote the manuscript.

Although aquatic life experiences reduced gravity effects, land plants have evolved under a 1-g environment. Understanding gravitational effects requires changing the magnitude of this force. One method of eliminating gravity'’s influence is to enter into a free-fall orbit around the planet, thereby achieving a balance between centripetal force of gravity and the centrifugal force of the moving object. This balance is often mistakenly referred to as microgravity, but is best described as weightlessness. In addition to actually compensating gravity, instruments such as clinostats, random-positioning machines (RPM), and magnetic levitation devices have been used to eliminate effects of constant gravity on plant growth and development. However, these platforms do not reduce gravity but constantly change its direction. Despite these fundamental differences, there are few studies that have investigated the comparability between these platforms and weightlessness. Here, we provide a review of the strengths and weaknesses of these analogs for the study of plant growth and development compared to spaceflight experiments. We also consider reduced or partial gravity effects via spaceflight and analog methods.

    "introduction": "Introduction Plants have evolved under the influence of Earth'’s gravity, a force of “1 g.” This ubiquitous force affects plant growth, development, and morphology at all levels, from the molecular to the whole plant (Vandenbrink et al., 2014). In addition, gravity underlies other physical phenomena like buoyancy, convection, and sedimentation, which affect many physical and chemical processes and therefore also shape plant growth and development. For example, buoyancy affects gas exchange, cellular respiration, and photosynthesis, but itself is a function of varying densities (Braun et al., 2018). Studying the direct and indirect effects of gravity on plant growth, however, is complicated by the difficulty of changing gravity on Earth. One means of reducing gravity'’s influence is to establish free fall and eliminate the effect of gravity either for a few seconds in so-called drop towers and parabolic flights or for the long term by using orbital free fall, which creates weightlessness. This condition is achieved by the balance between Earth'’s gravity and the velocity required to maintain free fall (Kiss, 2015). Experiments focusing on plant growth and development have been carried out in this environment almost from the advent of human spaceflight in the 1960s (Wolverton and Kiss, 2009; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). Fascinating insights into plant biology have been provided by spaceflight studies aboard orbiting spacecraft. For instance, at the cell/molecular level, changes in the cell cycle (Manzano et al., 2009; Matía et al., 2010) and the cell wall (Soga et al., 2002; Johnson et al., 2015) have been observed when plants develop in microgravity. Recently, there have been a plethora of spaceflight experiments on the effects of varying gravity levels on gene expression in plants (Paul et al., 2012; Correll et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Paul et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). And facilitated by the absence of significant gravitational accelerations in spaceflight, novel mechanisms of phototropism (Molas and Kiss, 2009) have been discovered in flowering plants (Millar et al., 2010; Kiss et al., 2012; Vandenbrink et al., 2016). On the applied side of plant space research, there has also been progress on cultivating plants for use in bioregenerative life support systems (Braun et al., 2018). Because of the scarcity of access to spaceflight, researchers have used other approaches to minimize or eliminate constant 1-g conditions (Kiss, 2015). These methods include drop towers (samples are weightlessness for seconds), parabolic flights in specialized airplanes (samples are weightlessness for approximately 10–20 s), and sounding rockets (minutes of weightlessness) as attractive alternatives (see also Beysens and van Loon, 2015). Sounding rockets are retrieved in the same general area after their launch without entering into orbit. In the free-fall phase, these missions typically provide 3–8 min of microgravity (Böhmer and Schleiff, 2019). In recent years, private companies such as Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are promising suborbital flight with several minutes of microgravity (Pelton, 2019). However, for most systems in plant biology, these suborbital methods provide a period of weightlessness that is too short to effectively assay growth and development. A conceptual alternative to these methods of creating brief free-fall conditions is to develop conditions in which the direction of the gravity vector is constantly changing through the use of clinostats and similar devices.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions and Future Directions Numerous studies have compared the biological effects of clinostats and other microgravity analogs to space experiments (e.g., Brown et al., 1996; Kraft et al., 2000; Herranz et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2018). The experiments to date suggest that while these devices may be useful tools in some cases, there are great differences observed between plants that grow and develop on these devices and plants that are grown in weightlessness during spaceflight. In fact, rotation on certain types of clinostats may have deleterious effects in some biological systems (Hensel and Sievers, 1980; Kozeko et al., 2018; Ruden et al., 2018). The conditions under which ground-based simulation can provide useful information and compare various gravitational regimens need to be systematically determined through carefully controlled experiments in which ground analog studies are compared with spaceflight experiments. A problem with past studies of microgravity simulators/analogs is that it can be difficult to compare results between spaceflight experiments to those of simulation devices (Herranz et al., 2013). Thus, ground-based experiments should be performed to maximize comparability between spaceflight and experimental ground-based devices. For example, in plant studies, factors to consider include identical seed stock, growth substrate, nutrient media, and light composition and intensity. In addition, containers should be identical for space and ground-based studies. This latter consideration can be made difficult by the reluctance of space agencies to provide access to their expensive spaceflight hardware (Kiss, 2015). Nevertheless, in this era of the International Space Station, we must take advantage of its unique facilities to compare effects observed in clinostats and other space simulators. We also should use the centrifuges available on the ISS to systematically explore the effects of partial gravity on plant growth and development. Understanding plant biology in space under different gravity levels will be useful as we develop technologies needed for human habitation of other worlds.",

However, for most systems in plant biology, these suborbital methods provide a period of weightlessness that is too short to effectively assay growth and development. A conceptual alternative to these methods of creating brief free-fall conditions is to develop conditions in which the direction of the gravity vector is constantly changing through the use of clinostats and similar devices.Clinostats Clinostats have been developed since gravity was identified as a major contributor of plant growth and development by Knight, Sachs, and Ciesielski in the late 1800s (reviewed in Hoson et al., 1997; van Loon 2007; Hasenstein, 2009; Herranz et al., 2013). A clinostat is a device that rotates specimens around one or more axes. A number of different types of clinostats have been used to study plant growth and development as well as to address basic issues in fundamental biology. These clinostats can be divided into several types: one-axis clinostats with slow (1–4 rpm) or fast (50–120 rpm) rotation and clinostats with two or three axes of rotation. If the rate of rotation for the axes varies, such systems are distinguished as random positioning machines (RPMs). In addition to these instruments, magnetic levitation has been used to balance gravity (Kamal et al., 2016). One-Axial Clinostats The first experiments to expose plants to altered gravity environments were performed nearly 160 years before humans reached low-Earth orbit. Early in the 19th century, T.A. Knight used a water wheel as a centrifuge to expose oat seedlings to variable acceleration, demonstrating that plants were indeed sensing this physical force when carrying out “geotropic” growth (Knight, 1806). Later in the same century, Sachs developed a device, which he named a “klinostat,” to alter the effects of gravity by constantly rotating its longitudinal axis horizontally, thereby averaging the presumed effect of the gravitational force over the rotated axis (Sachs, 1882). Clinostats have been employed as a control for the gravitational force in numerous studies investigating plant development and responses to directional stimuli ( Figure 1 ). The clinostat has frequently been used for studies in which the researcher wished to reorient the organ or cell in the gravitational field for a period of time, then eliminate, as much as possible, the influence of constant gravity on the organ. Such was the use of clinostats in experiments investigating both the presentation time, perception time, and lag time of the gravitropic response of various species and organs (Pickard 1973; Johnsson and Pickard, 1979; Kiss et al., 1989). The theoretical justification for the use of clinostats was elaborated by Dedolph and Dipert (1971); they demonstrated the importance of the rotation rate on the effectiveness of the clinostat due to its influence on the sedimentation path of the starch statoliths, thought to be the primary means of gravity susception in plants (Kiss, 2000). They found that rotation rates of 2–4 rpm corresponded to a more effective randomization because it minimized the path length of statolith sedimentation. Figure 1. Open in a new tab A standard two-dimensional clinostat used to grow Medicago seedlings (green arrows) at 1 rpm. Blue arrow indicated the direction of rotation. Scale bar, 10.5 cm.In addition to their use as a means of minimizing the unidirectional effects of gravity, several studies have incorporated modified versions of the clinostat that expose the axial organ to a fractional g treatment either through a programmed rotation pattern or through the incorporation of a centrifuge as the innermost rotating axis of the clinostat. These instruments have been key in estimating the threshold acceleration necessary to activate gravity perception and growth responses (Shen-Miller et al., 1968; Brown et al., 1995; Laurinavicius et al., 1998; Galland et al., 2004; Duemmer et al., 2015; Bouchern-Dubuisson et al., 2016; Frolov et al., 2018), as well as identifying cellular-level responses of plants to microgravity (Murakami and Yamada, 1988; Kraft et al., 2000; Dauzart et al., 2016; Manzano et al., 2018) and the persistence of the gravity stimulus (John and Hasenstein, 2011). Despite their usefulness for temporarily changing the unidirectional force of gravity, there is also evidence that such treatments introduce their own sets of stimuli that may compete with or confound interpretation of those pathways of most interest to the user (Hasenstein and van Loon, 2015). Centrifugal forces resulting from rotation about one or two axes varies as a function of the position of the organ under study along the radius and speed of rotation, and the organ will experience variable g levels across its axis. Because the force of gravity itself is never altered, the bending due to differential growth will cause the position of the organ with respect to the radius of rotation to change over the course of an experiment. For example, the growth of an axial organ over the course of a long-term experiment will result in the organ experiencing a change in acceleration if the growth direction is away from the center of the axis of rotation. This factor is one source of complexity when interpreting the results of clinostat experiments, as indicated by the observation that plants respond differently when rotated around one axis versus the other (John and Hasenstein, 2011; Hasenstein and van Loon, 2015). Long-term experiments on clinostats are particularly challenging because as the organs increase in mass, the changing weight distribution will cause bending stresses and other non-random mechanical stimulation that will vary as a function of the specific load-bearing structure of each organ. Thus, growing plants on a rotating clinostat can result in mechanical stress (van Loon, 2007; Manzano et al., 2009). The use of clinostats to study developmental effects of gravity are also limited because of their inability to control for constantly changing loads and rotational forces, thus restricting their usefulness with plants mainly to studies of directional growth responses. Thus, many factors, such as weighting distribution and rotation velocity, need to be considered when designing clinostats for life science experiment (Brown et al., 1996). Despite these disadvantages, the simplicity and availability of clinostats are the main reasons that these devices are the most common approach to attempt to simulate altered gravity conditions. Although the artifacts associated with clinostats require caution of the assessment of gravitational effects, they can provide valuable comparisons with space experiments and have been widely used by many researchers (e.g., Brown et al., 1995; Kraft et al., 2000).Fast-Rotating Clinostats Slow-rotating clinostats as described above simply consider the overall geometry and develop a scheme of rotation that fulfills certain conditions (such as centrifugal accelerations less than 10−3 g). However, fast-rotating clinostats (typically 50–120 rpm) also utilize the path of sedimentation in a fluid, usually an aqueous growth medium for small (<1 mm) organisms (Aleshcheva et al., 2016; Warnke et al., 2016). In liquids, sedimentation and a relatively slow rotation result in potentially significant artifacts including spirally movements from centrifugation, sedimentation, and a viscosity-dependent Coriolis force. When the speed of rotation is increased as in a fast-rotating clinostat, sedimentation of a particle will be less than the movement of the liquid, thereby resulting in a reduced radius that finally produces a smaller diameter than the size of the particle or a cell. Thus, in the conditions as found in the fast-rotating clinostat, the rotation stabilizes the fluid around the particle, which in turn eliminates the gravity effects for all practical purposes. While the fast-rotating clinostat can provide conditions that mimic weightlessness very well, it is limited to small organisms such as unicells or bacteria but, generally, not applicable for plant studies (Cogoli, 1992).Non-Uniformly Rotating Clinostats In addition to positioning one-axial clinostats at certain angles to mimic fractional gravity levels (<1 g), it is possible to achieve a similar condition by changing the rate of horizontal rotation such that the rotation is stopped during the bottom time (Brungs et al., 2016). The bottom dwell time determines the effective residual acceleration. When uniform rotation represents complete gravity compensation for a 1-rpm (∼0.1 rad s−1) clinostat, extending each rotation by the amount of gravity that is supposed to be established, for example 0.1 g, would require a bottom dwell time of 6 s. The extra 6 s relative to the normal rotation of 60 s (=1 rpm) spent at the “bottom” position ( Figure 2 ) creates 0.1 g net acceleration. Because additional acceleration or deceleration needs to be minimized, the movement requires precise algorithms and motor control. The advantage of such designs is that fractional g-levels can be established. Nonetheless, this principle also depends on rotation and therefore suffers from the same shortcomings as standard clinostats (Hasenstein and van Loon, 2015). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Motion profile of a an object experiencing fractional gravity as a result of non-uniform rotation. The trace of a point rotating around an axis shows an extended resting position during phase T1. The ratio between the dwell time in the bottom position (T1) and complete rotation (T0) corresponds to the fractional gravity experienced by plants, provided that the dwell time does not exceed the gravity perception time.Random Positioning Machines The limited ability to average gravity effects by horizontal rotation led to the evolution of RPMs in order not to generate constant accelerations in any particular direction (Kraft et al., 2000; van Loon, 2007; Herranz et al., 2013). The idea is to provide a more complex motion patterns than constant rotation around one or two axes such that no directional preference remains. Ideally rotation should occur around all three spatial axes (x, y, and z, i.e., pitch, yaw, and roll) and would require a three gimbal or Cardan suspension. However, most RPM systems are based on two axes or an “altazimuth mount” such that the two axes are mounted perpendicular to each other ( Figure 3 ). This arrangement is sufficient to position any object on the experimental platform in any desirable direction (i.e., the vector normal to the experimental platform can point in any direction). Thus, seedlings that develop on an RPM appear to grow randomly as achieved in spaceflight ( Figure 4 ). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Three random positioning machines (RPMs) each with two independently driven perpendicular frames. The discrete rotation axes allow the implementation of slip rings to provide power and exchange data with the experiment that can be mounted onto the inner frame. Both the full-sized RPM (A) and the two desktop models (B) are shown with 10-cm square Petri dishes (pd). The diameter of the disk (asterisk) on the full-sized RPM is 40 cm and provides the generation of partial gravity.Figure 4. Open in a new tab Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight hardware for 3.5 days in the dark. Arrowheads indicate the hypocotyl apex. (A) Seedlings that germinated and developed on the random positioning machine (RPM) are disoriented. (B) Ground controls (GR) are oriented to the gravity vector which is toward the bottom of the photograph. Scale bar, 6 mm. Figure is from Kraft et al. (2000) and is used with permission from Springer Nature publishers.Randomness is achieved when the rotational angle differs between the two axes and changes over time. While these systems provide the best gravity compensation, they do so despite apparently exceeding the maximum permissible angular acceleration (approx. 30 deg s−1 for a 10-cm radius). Apparently better results are obtained when the sum of both axes movements exceeds 60–80 deg s−1 (Brungs et al., 2016). While this puzzling observation deserves future studies, it also highlights some postulated gravisensing mechanisms, namely that the movement of the suspected gravity sensors (starch-filled amyloplasts; Kiss, 2000) is sensitive to mechanostimulation, and thus describes dynamic gravisensing (Hasenstein, 2009). Nevertheless, in gravity-perceiving root columella cells, the position of amyloplasts was similar in weightlessness in spaceflight and on the RPM, but was significantly different between spaceflight and two-axial clinostats ( Figure 5 ). For in vitro systems like Arabidopsis cell cultures, it is important to realize that in fluid-filled experimental containers, there is also a fluid shear applied to the cells (Leguy et al., 2017). This issue can be mitigated by increasing the cell substrate viscosity (Kamal et al., 2019). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Plastid position in central columella cells of root tips of Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the ground (GR), during spaceflight (FL), on a random positioning machine (RPM), and on a clinostat (CL). These cells are involved in gravity perception (Kiss, 2000). There is no statistical difference (P > 0.05) between the FL and RPM samples as indicated by *, while the FL samples are significantly different (P < 0.05) from the CL specimens as indicaated by ** and determined by an ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-test.Thus, the RPM can be a useful proxy for weightlessness for certain biological parameters, as shown in studies with plant cells, Drosophila, and mammalian cell cultures (Kraft et al., 2000; Herranz et al., 2010; Wuest et al., 2015). In addition, due to the difficulty, availability, and cost of spaceflight experiments, the RPM may in fact be one of the best substitutes/analogs especially when this instrument can potentially generate results comparable to those in true microgravity. This scenario is true especially when the changes in direction are faster than the response time of the object (e.g., plant body) to gravity (Borst and van Loon, 2009).Magnetic Levitation In contrast to the various clinostats that attempt to randomize the effect of gravity by changing the direction of its vector, magnetic forces counteract the gravity force by a magnetic force that results from a magnetic gradient and the diamagnetic susceptibility of the object which together generate a force that can be equal to gravity (Geim et al., 1999; Kamal et al., 2016). Interestingly, based on the orientation of the magnetic core, this gradient exists in two opposing directions such that in a vertically oriented magnetic field the top gradient balances gravity effects on biological, i.e., diamagnetic material at the point where F mag = Fg. The opposite pole of the magnetic gradient also generates a 1-g force equivalent and therefore provides a 2-g equivalent (1 g attributed to the magnetic gradient in addition to the original gravity). While the effect of magnetic gradients and diamagnetic properties of the levitated object (e.g., frogs, seeds, or seedlings) balances the effect of gravity (i.e., stably suspend biological objects is space), the very strong magnetic field (about 15 T) and gradient is likely to affect the movement of charged particles (ions) and therefore alters the physiological conditions which affect gene expression (Paul et al., 2006). In addition, the small space in a magnet bore, the requirement to cool magnets while maintaining “room temperature” for biological objects, and to provide light, contributes to the complexity of magnetic levitation. The required strong magnetic field and gradient (about 1,400 T2/m) also require specialized magnetic systems that are expensive to operate. Additional research is needed to determine which systems best mimic reduced gravity conditions, especially for plants that occupy a large volume and are therefore affected by any gradient of rotational, inertial, or magnetic conditions. Despite the above-mentioned complications, the ability to produce partial or even excess gravity forces makes magnetic gradients an attractive alternative to clinostat-based research. As indicated earlier, the precise and narrow space that corresponds to the desired level makes studies on whole plants problematic because the compensation point averages all forces acting on the levitated object by susceptibility, density, and distance. Thus, the most valuable aspect of high-gradient magnetic fields is the ability to precisely move (levitate) cellular organelles, such as statoliths in roots (Kuznetsov and Hasenstein, 1996), hypocotyls (Kuznetsov and Hasenstein, 1997), rhizoids (Kuznetsov and Hasenstein, 2001), and seedlings (Hasenstein and Kuznetsov, 1999). In addition, magnetic levitation has been shown to be a useful ground-based proxy for microgravity in a number of other systems including osteoblast cells (Hammer et al., 2009), Drosophila melanogaster (Herranz et al., 2012), and bacteria (Dijkstra et al., 2010).Centrifuges Although it sounds somewhat counterintuitive, we can also explore the effects of microgravity by the application of centrifuges. This reduced gravity paradigm (RGP) is based on the premise that adaptations seen going from a hypergravity level to a lower gravity level are similar to changes seen going from 1 g to microgravity (van Loon, 2016). Using such a paradigm, we are not focusing on the absolute acceleration values but rather on the responses generated due to the change between the two accelerations levels. The premise of such an experiment is that the plant sample has to be adapted and stable to a higher gravity level such as 2 g. Then, as the g-level is lowered to 1 g, the plant will respond to this reduced gravity level. It is hypothesized that the processes in such adaptations are of the same type as one would see going from 1 g into free fall, although the magnitude might be different. Thus, this reduced gravity paradigm is best used for stable and steady systems at a certain higher g level combined with measuring a relatively fast responding phenomenon when reducing the acceleration load.Reduced or Partial Gravity Studies Numerous studies on plant growth and development have been performed in space (Wolverton and Kiss, 2009; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). In contrast, we know little about plant physiology in reduced gravity environments, which are less than the normal 1 g that characterizes Earth-based studies. Reduced gravity can also be termed partial-g or fractional-g. The exploration of the Moon and Mars will be important in the future and will rely upon optimized plant cultivation because plants will be essential for life support systems (Kiss, 2014). Therefore, it is important to develop new knowledge about the biology of plants at the lunar and Martian g-levels, 0.17 g and 0.38 g, respectively. Studies on plants in partial gravity environments also can provide new information on basic biological questions such as what is the threshold of gravisensing in plants (e.g., Kiss et al., 1989; Perbal, 2009; Duemmer et al., 2015). To establish partial gravity on-board sounding rockets or orbiting laboratories, a centrifuge is needed to produce the desired accelerations. Centrifuges can be used to generate any acceleration from near zero to 1 g. Especially 1-g experiments are valuable as in-flight controls, which provide context for the analyses of spaceflight experiments (Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). Fortunately, there are several facilities on the International Space Station (ISS) that are equipped with centrifuges, and the ISS can be used to study partial gravity effects on plant development. Plant Responses in Reduced or Partial Gravity in Spaceflight A series of experiments have recently been performed on the ISS with Arabidopsis thaliana and have focused on 1) the interaction between gravitropism and phototropism in microgravity and fractional gravity (Kiss et al., 2012; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016; Vandenbrink et al., 2016) and 2) identification of the threshold for gravity perception in roots in the wild-type and starchless (pgm-1) mutants (Wolverton, in progress). These experiments utilized the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) which had onboard centrifuges allowing for gravitational ranges from microgravity to small fractions of a g up to 1 g (Kiss et al., 2014). The EMCS was decommissioned in 2017, but international space agencies have developed hardware such as Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) and Biolab support research at fractional g (Brinckmann, 2012). In experiments in which directional light and fractional gravity were applied simultaneously, Kiss and colleagues reported strong positive phototropism in response to unilateral red light in the stem-like hypocotyls and roots of plants grown in microgravity (Millar et al., 2010). In time course studies, shoots had positive phototropism in response to red light in microgravity and at 0.1 g, and the curvature was not significantly different between two gravity conditions ( Figure 6A ). However, the red-light-based phototropism at 0.3 g was not significantly different from the red-light phototropic response of the 1-g control, and there was significant reduction of red-light phototropism at 0.3 g and 1 g (see also Kiss et al., 2012). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Time course studies of positive phototropic curvature in seedlings of Arabidopsis at indicated gravity levels in a spaceflight experiment. Different letters indicate significant differences among the plots. (A) Response of the shoot-like hypocotyls of Arabidopsis seedlings to red light. The response at 0.3 g was not significantly different from the value of the 1-g control, and there was attenuation of red-light phototropism at 0.3 g and 1 g. (B) Response of the roots of Arabidopsis seedlings to red light. The responses at 0.1 g and 0.3 g were not significantly different from the value of the 1-g control, and these values were attenuated compared to the robust response in microgravity. Figure is adapted from Kiss et al. (2012).In experiments with seedlings, roots exhibited a strong positive phototropism in response to unidirectional red illumination in microgravity conditions ( Figure 6B ). In contrast to the experiments with shoots, the red-light-based phototropic response in roots at 0.1 g was reduced and not significantly different from the red phototropic curvature at 0.3 g and 1 g. Thus, our fractional gravity experiments demonstrated a reduction of red-light-based phototropic curvature in the shoot-like hypocotyls at the level of 0.3 g, but the level of 0.1 g was enough to reduce the red-light-based phototropism in roots. This range of fractional gravity is approximately the same as the g-levels found on the Moon and Mars, 0.17 g and 0.38 g, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest that this range of reduced g represents a significant sensory threshold. This hypothesis is being investigated further in a separate series of experiments designed to test the threshold force required to activate gravity sensing and response of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. Ground-based clinostat experiments have estimated the gravity perception threshold at or around 0.003 g (Shen-Miller et al., 1968; Laurinavicius et al., 1998; Duemmer et al., 2015). This threshold was tested in these space experiments, and the analysis currently is in progress. Extending these results to include the starchless mutant in addition to wild-type seedlings will allow for the comparison of gravity perception threshold in roots that lack sedimenting statoliths (Kiss et al., 1989), which we predict will require greater accelerations to activate perception and response in these seedlings.Plant Responses to Simulated Partial or Reduced Gravity Using Analogs While the main focus of this paper has been on the simulation of microgravity, we also see that there is potential to use the analog devices to simulate partial or reduced gravity conditions that are found on the Moon and Mars (Kiss, 2014). This approach has been recently used in RPM studies of the effects of simulated partial gravity on the balance between cell growth and cell proliferation during early plant development (Manzano et al., 2018). In another recent study using Arabidopsis tissue culture cells, cell proliferation and growth were uncoupled under simulated reduced gravity also using an RPM (Kamal et al., 2018). The results of these few studies are promising and encourage future exploration of simulated partial gravity for other biological systems. Successful application of partial gravity simulation could develop into new avenue of research. For example, the simulated Mars gravity of 0.38 g could be used in various biological studies to help prepare for a human mission to Mars.Conclusions and Future Directions Numerous studies have compared the biological effects of clinostats and other microgravity analogs to space experiments (e.g., Brown et al., 1996; Kraft et al., 2000; Herranz et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2018). The experiments to date suggest that while these devices may be useful tools in some cases, there are great differences observed between plants that grow and develop on these devices and plants that are grown in weightlessness during spaceflight. In fact, rotation on certain types of clinostats may have deleterious effects in some biological systems (Hensel and Sievers, 1980; Kozeko et al., 2018; Ruden et al., 2018). The conditions under which ground-based simulation can provide useful information and compare various gravitational regimens need to be systematically determined through carefully controlled experiments in which ground analog studies are compared with spaceflight experiments. A problem with past studies of microgravity simulators/analogs is that it can be difficult to compare results between spaceflight experiments to those of simulation devices (Herranz et al., 2013). Thus, ground-based experiments should be performed to maximize comparability between spaceflight and experimental ground-based devices. For example, in plant studies, factors to consider include identical seed stock, growth substrate, nutrient media, and light composition and intensity. In addition, containers should be identical for space and ground-based studies. This latter consideration can be made difficult by the reluctance of space agencies to provide access to their expensive spaceflight hardware (Kiss, 2015). Nevertheless, in this era of the International Space Station, we must take advantage of its unique facilities to compare effects observed in clinostats and other space simulators. We also should use the centrifuges available on the ISS to systematically explore the effects of partial gravity on plant growth and development. Understanding plant biology in space under different gravity levels will be useful as we develop technologies needed for human habitation of other worlds.Author Contributions JK wrote the first draft of the manuscript.

    "abstract": "Summary Understanding plant adaptive responses to the space environment is a requisite for enabling space farming. Spaceflight produces deleterious effects on plant cells, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis, a complex stress-sensitive process coordinated with cell division and differentiation, known to be activated by red light. Here, in a series of ground studies, we have used mutants from the two Arabidopsis nucleolin genes (NUC1 and NUC2, nucleolar regulators of ribosome biogenesis) to better understand their role in adaptive response mechanisms to stress on Earth. Thus, we show that nucleolin stress-related gene NUC2 can compensate for the environmental stress provided by darkness in nuc1 plants, whereas nuc2 plants are not able to provide a complete response to red light. These ground control findings, as part of the ESA/NASA Seedling Growth spaceflight experiments, will determine the basis for the identification of genetic backgrounds enabling an adaptive advantage for plants in future space experiments.

    "introduction": "Introduction Space exploration will soon include new human missions to the Moon as a first step in the human exploration of Mars. Recent studies in human (i.e., NASA Twin Study, Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) and mammalian systems (rodent missions, Beheshti et al., 2019; Ronca et al., 2019) are paving the way to understand the effects of the microgravity environment on human physiology, but human life in space will rely on the essential role of plants in bioregenerative life support systems (Zabel et al., 2016), not only as a source of water, food, and removal of CO2 but also by providing a terrestrial-like environment for the psychological well-being of astronauts. Due to their sessile condition, plants have to promote adaptive responses to cope with changes in environmental conditions. Light plays multiple roles in the mechanisms of these adaptive responses. On the one hand, light is the source of energy by means of photosynthesis and regulates indirectly cell proliferation and cell growth via the central regulator TOR kinase through the expression of S-phase genes, and also ribosome biogenesis (Caldana et al., 2013; Xiong et al., 2013; Sablowski and Carnier Dornelas, 2014). In addition, light is a major driver in the establishment of the patterns of plant growth and development, by means of phototropism and photomorphogenesis. In playing this role, light is associated with gravity as one of the major tropistic cues, such that gravitropism and phototropism (and the interaction between them) are essential modulators of plant development (Vandenbrink et al., 2014). At the cellular and molecular levels, plant development relies on the activity of cell growth and proliferation taking place in the meristems, which supply differentiated cells and are influenced by the tropistic cues (Perrot-Rechenmann, 2010). Darkness is indeed a stress condition for plants. Several articles describe that in the dark, apical meristem proliferation is arrested in the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle (López-Juez et al., 2008; Mohammed et al., 2017), but in the root meristem, light induces the production of flavonols and other metabolites leading to the reduction of cell proliferation (Silva-Navas et al., 2016). This reduction could be related to the sugar starvation that results from the inability to perform photosynthesis. However, red light has a stimulating effect on ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. An increase in the mitotic index, in the expression of some regulators of these processes at both gene expression and protein levels, and in post-translational modifications of some protein factors has been described in plants irradiated with red light (Tong et al., 1997; Reichler et al., 2001). The absence of gravity (weightlessness, or microgravity, as it exists in free-fall, or in spaceflight) is also, by itself, a stress condition for plants, and specifically for the functions of meristematic cells (Matía et al., 2010; Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., 2016). An experiment performed in the International Space Station (ISS) in which Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grew for 4 days in darkness resulted in an increase in the rate of cell proliferation and a decrease in the cell growth rate, estimated by the activity of ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus, compared with the 1g control (Matía et al., 2010). As the coordination of these two activities defines meristematic competence, the effect of the lack of tropistic stimuli, particularly of gravity signals, may result in serious alterations of the developmental pattern of the plant, as was also shown in simulated microgravity experiments (Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., 2016). The Seedling Growth (SG) experiments, recently performed in the ISS, aimed at unraveling the link between phototropism and gravitropism, using the weightless environment of spaceflight (Vandenbrink et al., 2019; Herranz et al., 2019). In the first SG experiment, A. thaliana seedlings corresponding to wild-type (WT) ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler) and two phytochrome mutants (phyA and phyB) known to be involved in phototropism (Kiss et al., 2003; Molas and Kiss, 2008) were grown in space for 6 days and photostimulated for the last 2 days, revealing differential blue and red light phototropism in space (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). The analysis of the expression of regulatory genes of cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis showed that red light irradiation produced a significant reversion of the uncoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth caused by microgravity in darkness (Matía et al., 2010) and, consequently, a compensation of the loss of meristematic competence (Valbuena et al., 2018). In view of these results from our previous space experiments, we decided to focus on the cellular process of ribosome biogenesis for the successive spaceflight experiments of the SG project, with the purpose of testing the separate and synergistic effects of the light and gravity tropistic signals on specific molecular and cellular components of this process. Ribosome biogenesis, which takes place in the nucleolus, represents the most complex multi-step process that the cell must perform and is one of the most intricately regulated and controlled (Sáez-Vásquez and Medina, 2008; Pelletier et al., 2018). Therefore, its regulation must adapt to the environmental conditions in which the cell finds itself and coordinate with other cellular processes, such as cell division and differentiation. Several studies have described and used the nucleolus as a major stress sensor, using stress-induced changes in the organization and composition of this organelle (Mayer and Grummt, 2005; Boulon et al., 2010; Lewinska et al., 2010; Kalinina et al., 2018). Briefly, ribosome biogenesis consists of the transcription of 45S rRNA genes (45S rDNA) containing the sequences of 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs, followed by the multi-step cleavage of 45S pre-rRNA to produce, in association with 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins (RPs), the mature ribosomal subunits, which are then exported to the cytoplasm and assembled as mature ribosomes. In addition to RPs, hundreds of non-ribosomal proteins (NRPs), or nucleolar proteins and small nucleolar RNAs are required for ribosome biogenesis, playing regulatory roles (Sáez-Vásquez and Delseny, 2019). Among NRPs, nucleolin is the most abundant protein of the nucleolus, where it plays a key role in the different steps involved in ribosome biogenesis, including RNA polymerase (Pol) I transcription, processing of pre-rRNA (Ginisty et al., 1999; Roger et al., 2003), and assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport of ribosome particles (Bouvet et al., 1998). Moreover, nucleolin has been even implicated in other functions, with or without collateral relationship with ribosome biogenesis (Angelov et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2007; Mongelard and Bouvet, 2007; Stepiński, 2012). Animal and yeast genomes encode a single nucleolin gene, whereas plants offer various examples of gene multiplicity. In A. thaliana, two genes encoding nucleolin proteins have been described: NUC1 and NUC2 (Pontvianne et al., 2007, 2010). The NUC1 gene is highly and ubiquitously expressed in normal growth conditions and NUC1 protein is required to inhibit NUC2 gene expression at the transcriptional level and may also influence the accumulation of NUC2 protein. In contrast, NUC2 is a functional protein-coding gene developmentally controlled in most plant tissues and organs (Durut et al., 2014). NUC1 and NUC2 proteins localize in the nucleolus. Disruption of NUC1 gene (nuc1-2 mutant) leads to severe defects in plant growth and development. At the molecular level, this mutant produces NUC2 expression, nucleolus disorganization, rDNA (NOR) heterochromatin decondensation, pre-rRNA accumulation, de-repression of specific rDNA variants, and de-methylation of some sequences of rDNA (Pontvianne et al., 2010). In contrast, disruption of NUC2 gene (nuc2-2 mutant) has much weaker effects. The nuc2-2 mutant seedlings grow quite similarly to WT plants, but flowering occurs later. Knockout of the NUC2 gene induces expression of some rDNA variants and hypermethylation of some sequences of pre-rRNA. In addition, NUC2 is required for the stability of rDNA variants' copy number (Durut et al., 2014). In this article, in a series of ground studies to complement space experiments, we have exposed A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) WT, nuc1-2 and nuc2-2 seedlings to two different illumination regimes at the beginning of the plant development (6 days from germination). In addition to highlighting the importance of Earth reference controls in spaceflight -omics experiments, our goal was to better understand the responses of nucleolin mutants to red light stimulation for further uses in space experiments under altered gravity conditions. The differential adaptive responses to the light are shown, suggesting that stress-related mutants may show a reduced response to environmental stress. In the long term, these results may lead to more efficient agriculture if an exaggerated response may reduce plant development under suboptimal environmental conditions.",

Seedlings were germinated in the same spaceflight hardware during 4 days with a day/night cycle of illumination, and then half of the samples were exposed to 2 days of darkness and the other group to 2 days of continuous red light (Figure 1A). After 6 days growth in the culture chamber (CC), the experiment was completed and the phenotypes of the three mutants were observed (Figure 1B, Supplemental Information, Figure S1). Seedling growth was homogeneous within each cassette, with clearly smaller seedlings in the case of the nuc1-2 mutant. No clear phenotypical differences were observed in the root system physiology between darkness- and red light-stimulated samples (including the absence of red phototropism at 1g conditions). The phenotype was compared with a previous experiment with the same duration and genotypes but in petri dishes and with a 6-day photoperiod illumination profile (Manzano et al., 2020 submitted). Despite the effects of the TROPI cassette volume, the overall phenotype of the seedlings is also very similar in both studies. Figure 1.

(C) Principal-component analysis (PCA) of the 18 samples (three replicates per condition) using read counts data from FeatureCounts. This diagram gives an overview of the similarities and dissimilarities between samples and the experimental conditions' overall effects (see Data S1 for an RNA quality report on the red light samples). All replicates are consistently grouped according to their experimental conditions, and two clear PC1 (for illumination conditions during the last 2 days of growth: darkness and red light) and PC2 (for genetic background: WT, nuc1-2, and nuc2-2) are observed.The quality of the replicates and overall similarities among the illumination regimes and different plants used is shown by principal-component analysis (PCA, Figure 1C and Supplemental Information, Data S1). First, a clear difference between the transcriptional profile of the WT, nuc1-2, and nuc2-2 plants exposed to darkness or red light photostimulation during the last 2 days of growth is shown by principal component 1 (PC1). Second, the differences between the genotypes can be observed in principal component 2 (PC2), where the nuc1-2 genotype has the most disrupted nucleolus phenotype, in that the nuc2-2 mutant is closer to the WT. The effect is clearer in the dark samples, because the red light stimulation produces more similarities among the three genotypes. Last, all the biological replicates included in the study cluster together according to the experimental condition, strengthening the statistical validity of the study. The use of three biological replicates (including up to 10 seedlings each) is enough considering the difficulties in increasing this number due to the availability of spaceflight research capabilities. Global Effect of Red Light Photostimulation Differs in Each Arabidopsis thaliana Line To understand the effect of the two lighting regimes (red light and darkness) on the transcriptional status, we compared seedlings with the differential illumination during the last 2 days of the plant growth period for each of the lines used (WT, nuc1-2, and nuc2-2). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the WT is 1,428 genes, of which 1,067 have their expression activated and 361 have it repressed. In the nuc1-2 mutant, the total number of DEGs is lower (1,001), mainly at the expense of the up-regulated genes (633 are over-expressed and 368 are repressed). The number of DEGs from the comparison (red light versus darkness) in the nuc2-2 mutant is very similar as in the WT: a total of 1,017 up-regulated genes and 339 down-regulated genes, making a total of 1,365 DEGs (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG p adj<0.05, Red Light Photostimulation versus Darkness) in WT and Nucleolin Mutants (nuc1-2 and nuc2-2) (A) Venn diagram comparing all DEGs and the five most significant gene ontology (GO Enrichment) categories in the common DEG in the three genotypes. (B) Venn diagram comparing up-regulated DEGs and the five most significant gene ontology (GO Enrichment) categories in the common DEGs in the WT and nuc2-2 genotypes and in the three genotypes, respectively. (C) Venn diagram comparing down-regulated DEGs and the five most significant gene ontology (GO Enrichment) categories from common DEGs in the three genotypes.Venn diagrams illustrate the group of DEGs that is affected in a single genotype or shared by others (Figure 2). Red light up-regulated genes affected only 298 genes in the WT, 134 genes in nuc1-2 mutant, and 199 genes for nuc2-2 mutant. On the other hand, the WT has 34 up-regulated genes in common with nuc1-2 but a large collection of 353 genes in common with nuc2-2 (note that the total number of up-regulated genes common for the three genotypes is 382), and only 83 genes for both nucleolin mutants (Figure 2B). Among DEGs down-regulated by the red light compared with the dark, there is a similar number of unique DEGs for each of them; 139 genes for the WT, 142 genes for the nuc1-2 mutant, and 104 genes for the nuc2-2 mutant. In this case, the number of DEGs down-regulated in the three lines is 125 genes, without any of the pair comparisons reaching that level (the nuc1-2 and nuc2-2 mutants have 44 and 53 genes in common with WT, respectively, whereas the two nucleolin mutants share 57 down-regulated genes, Figure 2C). In summary, the line with the least number of DEGs, when we compare plants illuminated with red light with those kept in darkness, is the nuc1-2 mutant. As the down-regulation response seems similar in all genotypes, the global effect is mainly due to a higher number of up-regulated DEGs in both nuc2-2 and WT genotypes. In fact, we can easily extrapolate from Figure 2B and compare the gene lists, including the common responses to red light (382 genes) and the list of up-regulated genes not detected in the nuc1-2 phenotype (353 genes). The main difference between these lists is shown by the functional analysis “GO Enrichment” included in Figure 2. All genotypes show the obvious photosynthesis/light-harvesting response together with increased Calvin cycle activity, but the nuc1-2 genotype is the only one lacking an increased secondary metabolism, together with a response to stress elements (cold) observed in both WT and nuc2-2. These results suggest that the presence of the NUC1 protein is necessary for the known effect of red light in the stimulation of cell proliferation, but the NUC2 protein is not an important player in that response. A complementary functional analysis has been done using the full lists of up- or down-regulated genes in each genotype, obtained by means of a Heatmap GO Enrichment. Up-regulated gene lists reveal that red light photostimulation versus darkness mainly leads to an unequivocal activation of genes involved in different phases of photosynthesis, together with processes that involve external encapsulation, secondary metabolism, and drug catabolism in all three A. thaliana lines examined (Supplemental Information, Figure S2A). Other significantly affected categories are the GO involving cell wall modification, pathogenesis, responses to insects, and defense mechanisms to bacteria. In addition to the mentioned GO groups, red light activates different biosynthetic processes (ketone, cutin, and small molecules) and the response to stimuli, such as cold and UV light, in the WT and nuc2-2 mutant lines. Solely in the WT line, an enrichment in cell division-related genes (microtubule-based movement, cell cycle, meiotic cell cycle) is produced. In the case of down-regulated GO groups, red light photostimulation reduces expression of genes involved in the response to different stimuli (temperature, hypoxia, light, abscisic acid, oxidative stress) as well as the circadian rhythm of plants (Supplemental Information, Figure S2B). Additional down-regulated genes involved in the response to stress appear in WT and nuc2-2 comparison (heat and osmotic stress), in the WT and nuc1-2 comparison (cold acclimation, response to karrikin, hormone metabolism, and cell wall modification), or nuc1-2 only (response to gibberellin). The two nucleolin mutant lines share a repression of the amino acid metabolism (alpha-amino acid catabolic process and leucine degradation). Dissecting Transcriptional Status for Each Genotype for Illumination Conditions at Normal Earth Gravity To better understand the differences in the transcriptional status of each genotype that could be attributed to the illumination conditions designed to be used in the SG spaceflight experiment, we performed a series of comparisons between the different lines, namely, nuc1-2 versus WT, nuc2-2 versus WT, and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2, when they are either photostimulated with red light or kept in darkness for 48 h, after a growth period of 4 days under a 16 h/8 h white light photoperiod regime (regular growth condition). The total number of DEGs when comparing the severe mutant nuc1-2 with the WT is remarkable, with thousands of genes affected in the different illumination conditions. A similar result was obtained in the comparison of nuc1-2 with nuc2-2. This number was much higher in the comparisons of the nuc1-2 mutant with both the Col-0 and nuc2-2 mutant in darkness: 3,363 genes and 2,121 genes, respectively. Under red light stimulation, the numbers dropped to half: 1,499 genes compared with the WT and 1,069 compared with nuc2-2, respectively. In contrast, the small number of DEGs between the WT and nuc2-2 mild mutant (just 149 genes in darkness conditions) peaked to 225 when red light photostimulation was provided (Figure 3). The up- and down-regulated genes showed similar trends in this case (Supplemental Information, Figure S3). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG p adj<0.05, in the Three Genotype Pair-Comparisons among WT, nuc1-2, and nuc2-2) within the Same Experimental Condition (A) Venn diagram comparing all DEGs between plants exposed to darkness the last 2 days. (B) Venn diagram comparing all DEGs between plants exposed to red light stimulation the last 2 days.The differential numbers in DEGs can be assigned to particular GO groups. Ontology analysis shows that both comparisons involving the nuc1 mutant in the darkness produced an increase in the expression of genes mainly involved in cell division, such as cell cycle, meiotic cell cycle, microtubule cytoskeleton, nuclear chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, and cell cycle-G2/M transition (Supplemental Information, Figure S4A). Furthermore, in the nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparisons, categories of responses to different stimuli, namely, responses to auxin, red light, gravity, and UV and ionizing radiations, also appeared overrepresented. In the comparison nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 in darkness, most functional categories (GO terms) appearing up-regulated in the nuc1-2 mutant are related to the cell wall (cell wall macromolecule catabolic process, pectin biosynthetic process), the cuticle (cuticle development and cutin, suberin, and wax biosyntheses), and the plasma membrane (anchored component of plasma membrane, very-long-chain fatty acid biosynthetic process, transmembrane receptor protein kinase activity). The up-regulated processes when red light is applied are quite different (Supplemental Information, Figure S4B). In the nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparisons, DEGs appeared involved in cell wall (structural constituents of cell wall) and in development (positive regulation of growth, post-embryonic plant morphogenesis, cellular response to ethylene stimulus). In the nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparison, many genes with a red-light-activated expression were involved in ribosome biogenesis (preribosome, maturation of SSU-rRNA, 90S preribosome, maturation of 5.8S RNA, ribosomal large subunit biogenesis). The two nucleolin mutant lines relative to WT (nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc2-2 versus WT comparisons) in conditions of red light photoactivation have up-regulated genes involved in different response processes, such as the responses to hypoxia, drug, antibiotic, salicylic acid, and wounding. The number of response processes was increased in the nuc2-2 versus WT comparison with the GO categories: responses to cold, bacterium, and abscisic acid. The identification of common gene categories down-regulated in both darkness and red light conditions was more challenging (Supplemental Information, Figures S4C and S4D). In darkness, nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparisons were very similar and mainly related to developmental processes (regulation post-embryonic development, meristem development, regulation of seed development, plant organ senescence), mRNA quality (mRNA surveillance pathway), response to temperature (response to temperature stimulus, endopeptidase Clp complex, heat shock protein), and immune system (immune response, response to toxic substance, glutathione metabolism). In the comparisons indicated above, genes involved in long-day photoperiodism, flowering, rhythmic process, and response to light intensity were also less represented. In the same way, cellular responses to light stimulus category was over-represented in both nucleolin mutants with respect to WT and responses to light stimulus was a common GO category in all three comparisons. The gene categories repressed only in the nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparison were involved in the spliceosome, protein demethylation, chromatin organization, mRNA binding, and histone acetyltransferase activity. The gene categories with repressed expression under red light for any of the comparisons (nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2) were related to mRNA splicing (alternative mRNA splicing via spliceosome), light responses (response to light stimulus, photoperiodism flowering, circadian rhythm), photosynthesis (chlorophyll biosynthesis process, chloroplast envelope), and the immune system (immune system process, defense response to bacterium, regulation of salicylic acid metabolic process, Supplemental Information, Figure S4D). Protein-Protein Interaction Networks Helps to Visualize the Differential Transcriptional State of nuc1-2 Genotype in 1g Control References Enrichment-PPI analysis (protein-protein interaction network) also showed that, in darkness, the mutant nuc1-2 has up-regulated the expression of genes involved in the regulation of G2/M transition of the mitotic cell cycle, mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, and auxin-activated signaling pathway, with respect to both the WT and the mutant nuc2-2 (Figure 4). In the down-regulation side, nuc1-2 mutant, when compared with WT, showed down-regulated genes involved in transcription regulator activity, sequence-specific DNA binding, defense response, and regulation of developmental process. In addition, the nuc1-2 mutant has genes with repressed expression in darkness condition related to negative regulation of circadian rhythm, responses to light stimulus, and responses to jasmonic acid, when compared with WT and nuc2-2 mutant (Figure 4). These results were in agreement with functional GO analysis (Supplemental Information, Figures S2 and S4). Figure 4.

    "discussion": "Discussion Results from Spaceflight Experiments Can Have Several Limitations that Are Not Often Present in Other Biological -Omics Works Major constraints of spaceflight experiments are the reduced amount of material and reproducibility, but other issues include the storage of samples before and after the experiment execution in space, causing staggered preparation and processing of the samples (Millar et al., 2010; Correll et al., 2013). In this work, we have shown that, using the spaceflight hardware and procedures, we can perform a transcriptomic analysis with enough reliability to describe the differential transcriptional state of the nucleolin mutants under different light conditions. Three replicates could be considered low for current standards for animal -omics studies in Earth, but in our experiment each replica already represents the average of 10 plants. We show here that the replicates expected to be collected from the spaceflight experiment can be estimated to be sufficient for performing a sequencing study that allows clustering of the different genotypes and environmental conditions (Figure 1). Due to logistical considerations, a specific constraint for plant space biology is the limited number of different mutants/genotypes that can be used in a spaceflight experiment in true microgravity. We have to be sure that the mutants of choice will provide valuable information. In that sense, the use of nucleolin mutants is a promising choice to provide insight into both the cell cycle and stress response mechanisms, apart from the ribosome biogenesis in which this protein is directly involved. These processes are known to be recurrently affected in space -omics experiments with plants (Choi et al., 2019; Ferl et al., 2015; Herranz et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2017; Kruse et al., 2017; Paul et al., 2013, 2017). The analysis performed here allows us to know the specific functions assumed by the two nucleolin proteins of A. thaliana (NUC1 and NUC2) in different environmental conditions, such as red light photostimulation and darkness, affecting tropistic stimuli. This information can be considered as the 1g reference control required to obtain the best possible understanding of the changes produced by the spaceflight conditions on plant development, and how the gravitational stress could be counteracted by changing phototropic stimuli. A longer-term goal is to use this knowledge for plant cultivation into bioregenerative life support systems. The Transcriptomic Baseline for Nucleolin Mutants Is Different under Red Light Photostimulation and Darkness Red light illumination mainly produces the activation of genes involved in photosynthesis, cell wall modification, drug catabolism, pathogenesis, and biotic stress response. Conversely, different abiotic stimuli responses (temperature, hypoxia, light, abscisic acid, oxidative stress) are down-regulated by the photostimulation treatment, as well as the circadian rhythm of plants. This transcriptional effect is similar in the three lines studied (Col-0 WT, nuc1-2, and nuc2-2), suggesting that it may be independent of the nucleolin protein functions. Therefore, the interpretation of transcriptional effects on plants' grown during spaceflight will be straightforward. In contrast, red light illumination produces a down-regulation of genes involved in the response to karritin, cold acclimation, and hormone metabolism in WT and nuc1-2, indicating that the NUC2 protein, and/or other proteins up-regulated in nuc1-2 (Pontvianne et al., 2007), could participate in these functions. In addition, in the nuc1-2 mutant, genes coding for response to gibberellin with the red light appear repressed. Gibberellin is a hormone involved in seed germination, bud and fruit formation, shoot longitudinal growth, and axial organ elongation (Hedden and Sponsel, 2015), which could support the relationship of defective plant growth and development with NUC1 gene disruption. Exposure to the dark during the last 2 days of cultivation of seedlings promotes gene categories mainly involved in processes of cell division and in the response to different stimuli (red light, UV, ionizing radiation, gravity, auxins). They are common in nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparisons and unique in nuc1-2 versus WT comparison. These observations could indicate that, in a stress condition such as darkness, the NUC2 protein is capable of rescuing functions that the NUC1 protein performs under normal growth conditions. Indeed, a role of nucleolin in mitosis has been reported (de Carcer and Medina, 1999; Ma et al., 2007). Therefore, in the nuc1 mutant, the NUC2 protein would be capable of performing functions necessary for plant survival, such as ribosome biogenesis regulation (Pontvianne et al., 2007), cell proliferation, and DNA repair. It is important to note that cell division GO was only significantly up represented in the WT when red light was provided (Figure 2B). In contrast, the gene categories down-regulated in darkness are mainly related to developmental processes, mRNA quality, response to temperature, and immune system. This may indicate that in the dark stress condition, the NUC2 protein is not capable of supplying the function of the NUC1 protein in these processes. These results, together with those previously described, indicate that the functional rescue of NUC1 by NUC2, when NUC1 is not expressed, would be only partial, which may be due to the structural difference between both proteins, including longer N-terminal acidic domain and less-conserved GAR domain I in the C terminal (Durut and Sáez-Vásquez, 2015). Differential Role of Nucleolin Mutants' Transcriptomic Baseline May Offer New Insight in Spaceflight Experiments Differential transcriptional response is observed when comparing the two nucleolin mutants. The categories of genes activated differentially in both mutants (nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparison) are mainly involved in the cell wall and membrane systems. This finding is potentially interesting in space -omics to discriminate gravitropism from graviresistance mechanisms (Herranz and Medina, 2014) and could be related to the phenotype described in the nuc1-2 mutant, in which a reduction in the cell number and a disorganization in every cell layer is observed in transversal sections of primary leaves (Pontvianne et al., 2007). Moreover, the gene categories repressed only in the above-mentioned comparison are involved in the spliceosome, protein demethylation, chromatin organization, mRNA binding, and histone acetyltransferase activity, which could be related to the described antagonist activity of these two proteins in pre-rRNA methylation and with their role in chromatin remodeling, RNA Pol I transcription, mRNA stability, and RNA/DNA metabolism (Pontvianne et al., 2010; Durut et al., 2014). In the nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparison under red light photostimulation, the ribosome biogenesis GO shows the most significant enrichment within the up-regulated genes (Supplemental Information, Figure S4B). This result indicates that the described activating effect of red light in this process depends more on the expression of NUC2 protein than on the NUC1 expression. Ultimately, the two nucleolin mutant lines, compared with WT, have genes up-regulated by red light involved in different response processes, such as the response to hypoxia, drug, antibiotic, salicylic acid, and wounding. These response processes are extended in the nuc2-2 versus WT comparison, including response to cold, bacteria, and abscisic acid. These results indicate that even though both nucleolar proteins, NUC1 and NUC2, are involved in response processes, the implication of NUC2 is higher as to the number of processes. Therefore, NUC2 has a greater response capacity to environmental signals, such as illumination with red light, thus being more sensitive. A major challenge to be overcome in spaceflight -omics research is to differentiate and characterize which of the spaceflight environmental conditions (including not only microgravity and cosmic radiation but also the constraints imposed to the upload/download and storage processes in orbit, the gaseous atmosphere, among other factors) are responsible for each of the observed alterations in the transcriptome. According to our results, space -omics researchers need to pay special attention to the analysis of ground reference controls on Earth before conclusions can be made on the results obtained in spaceflight. In our particular example, the two nucleolin mutants are the perfect complement to the WT genotype to study how the NUC2 protein can replace the essential functions of NUC1 in orbit, and how light can modulate it, even rescuing WT transcriptional profiles in the nuc1-2 mutant. The fact that nuc2-2 mutant shows an increase in stress response GO when exposed to red light connects the red light stimulus with the modulation of the stress response. In parallel, the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis functions required to be restored in microgravity are also light dependent in both the nuc1-2 mutant (in Earth, as shown here) and the WT plants in orbit (Valbuena et al., 2018). Limitations of the Study Due to logistical constraints, this study lacks a continuously illuminated control set of samples performed simultaneously due to the absence of those samples in the spaceflight experiment as well as the reference experiment. The next step in this research is to analyze the samples from the space experiment in microgravity and the partial gravity conditions produced by the centrifuge in the EMCS on the ISS. We anticipate confirming that the duplicated nucleolin gene system works during spaceflight will lead us to discover novel mechanisms for plant adaptation to spaceflight conditions. Thus, this research will be eventually translated into better crops for life support systems in the human spaceflight ventures of the 21st century.

Copyright notice ID: 7607443 PMID: 33163940 Summary Understanding plant adaptive responses to the space environment is a requisite for enabling space farming. Spaceflight produces deleterious effects on plant cells, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis, a complex stress-sensitive process coordinated with cell division and differentiation, known to be activated by red light. Here, in a series of ground studies, we have used mutants from the two Arabidopsis nucleolin genes (NUC1 and NUC2, nucleolar regulators of ribosome biogenesis) to better understand their role in adaptive response mechanisms to stress on Earth. Thus, we show that nucleolin stress-related gene NUC2 can compensate for the environmental stress provided by darkness in nuc1 plants, whereas nuc2 plants are not able to provide a complete response to red light. These ground control findings, as part of the ESA/NASA Seedling Growth spaceflight experiments, will determine the basis for the identification of genetic backgrounds enabling an adaptive advantage for plants in future space experiments.

Recent studies in human (i.e., NASA Twin Study, Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) and mammalian systems (rodent missions, Beheshti et al., 2019; Ronca et al., 2019) are paving the way to understand the effects of the microgravity environment on human physiology, but human life in space will rely on the essential role of plants in bioregenerative life support systems (Zabel et al., 2016), not only as a source of water, food, and removal of CO2 but also by providing a terrestrial-like environment for the psychological well-being of astronauts. Due to their sessile condition, plants have to promote adaptive responses to cope with changes in environmental conditions. Light plays multiple roles in the mechanisms of these adaptive responses. On the one hand, light is the source of energy by means of photosynthesis and regulates indirectly cell proliferation and cell growth via the central regulator TOR kinase through the expression of S-phase genes, and also ribosome biogenesis (Caldana et al., 2013; Xiong et al., 2013; Sablowski and Carnier Dornelas, 2014). In addition, light is a major driver in the establishment of the patterns of plant growth and development, by means of phototropism and photomorphogenesis. In playing this role, light is associated with gravity as one of the major tropistic cues, such that gravitropism and phototropism (and the interaction between them) are essential modulators of plant development (Vandenbrink et al., 2014). At the cellular and molecular levels, plant development relies on the activity of cell growth and proliferation taking place in the meristems, which supply differentiated cells and are influenced by the tropistic cues (Perrot-Rechenmann, 2010). Darkness is indeed a stress condition for plants. Several articles describe that in the dark, apical meristem proliferation is arrested in the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle (López-Juez et al., 2008; Mohammed et al., 2017), but in the root meristem, light induces the production of flavonols and other metabolites leading to the reduction of cell proliferation (Silva-Navas et al., 2016). This reduction could be related to the sugar starvation that results from the inability to perform photosynthesis. However, red light has a stimulating effect on ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. An increase in the mitotic index, in the expression of some regulators of these processes at both gene expression and protein levels, and in post-translational modifications of some protein factors has been described in plants irradiated with red light (Tong et al., 1997; Reichler et al., 2001). The absence of gravity (weightlessness, or microgravity, as it exists in free-fall, or in spaceflight) is also, by itself, a stress condition for plants, and specifically for the functions of meristematic cells (Matía et al., 2010; Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., 2016). An experiment performed in the International Space Station (ISS) in which Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grew for 4 days in darkness resulted in an increase in the rate of cell proliferation and a decrease in the cell growth rate, estimated by the activity of ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus, compared with the 1g control (Matía et al., 2010). As the coordination of these two activities defines meristematic competence, the effect of the lack of tropistic stimuli, particularly of gravity signals, may result in serious alterations of the developmental pattern of the plant, as was also shown in simulated microgravity experiments (Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., 2016). The Seedling Growth (SG) experiments, recently performed in the ISS, aimed at unraveling the link between phototropism and gravitropism, using the weightless environment of spaceflight (Vandenbrink et al., 2019; Herranz et al., 2019). In the first SG experiment, A. thaliana seedlings corresponding to wild-type (WT) ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler) and two phytochrome mutants (phyA and phyB) known to be involved in phototropism (Kiss et al., 2003; Molas and Kiss, 2008) were grown in space for 6 days and photostimulated for the last 2 days, revealing differential blue and red light phototropism in space (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). The analysis of the expression of regulatory genes of cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis showed that red light irradiation produced a significant reversion of the uncoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth caused by microgravity in darkness (Matía et al., 2010) and, consequently, a compensation of the loss of meristematic competence (Valbuena et al., 2018). In view of these results from our previous space experiments, we decided to focus on the cellular process of ribosome biogenesis for the successive spaceflight experiments of the SG project, with the purpose of testing the separate and synergistic effects of the light and gravity tropistic signals on specific molecular and cellular components of this process. Ribosome biogenesis, which takes place in the nucleolus, represents the most complex multi-step process that the cell must perform and is one of the most intricately regulated and controlled (Sáez-Vásquez and Medina, 2008; Pelletier et al., 2018). Therefore, its regulation must adapt to the environmental conditions in which the cell finds itself and coordinate with other cellular processes, such as cell division and differentiation. Several studies have described and used the nucleolus as a major stress sensor, using stress-induced changes in the organization and composition of this organelle (Mayer and Grummt, 2005; Boulon et al., 2010; Lewinska et al., 2010; Kalinina et al., 2018). Briefly, ribosome biogenesis consists of the transcription of 45S rRNA genes (45S rDNA) containing the sequences of 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs, followed by the multi-step cleavage of 45S pre-rRNA to produce, in association with 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins (RPs), the mature ribosomal subunits, which are then exported to the cytoplasm and assembled as mature ribosomes. In addition to RPs, hundreds of non-ribosomal proteins (NRPs), or nucleolar proteins and small nucleolar RNAs are required for ribosome biogenesis, playing regulatory roles (Sáez-Vásquez and Delseny, 2019). Among NRPs, nucleolin is the most abundant protein of the nucleolus, where it plays a key role in the different steps involved in ribosome biogenesis, including RNA polymerase (Pol) I transcription, processing of pre-rRNA (Ginisty et al., 1999; Roger et al., 2003), and assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport of ribosome particles (Bouvet et al., 1998). Moreover, nucleolin has been even implicated in other functions, with or without collateral relationship with ribosome biogenesis (Angelov et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2007; Mongelard and Bouvet, 2007; Stepiński, 2012). Animal and yeast genomes encode a single nucleolin gene, whereas plants offer various examples of gene multiplicity. In A. thaliana, two genes encoding nucleolin proteins have been described: NUC1 and NUC2 (Pontvianne et al., 2007, 2010). The NUC1 gene is highly and ubiquitously expressed in normal growth conditions and NUC1 protein is required to inhibit NUC2 gene expression at the transcriptional level and may also influence the accumulation of NUC2 protein. In contrast, NUC2 is a functional protein-coding gene developmentally controlled in most plant tissues and organs (Durut et al., 2014). NUC1 and NUC2 proteins localize in the nucleolus. Disruption of NUC1 gene (nuc1-2 mutant) leads to severe defects in plant growth and development. At the molecular level, this mutant produces NUC2 expression, nucleolus disorganization, rDNA (NOR) heterochromatin decondensation, pre-rRNA accumulation, de-repression of specific rDNA variants, and de-methylation of some sequences of rDNA (Pontvianne et al., 2010). In contrast, disruption of NUC2 gene (nuc2-2 mutant) has much weaker effects. The nuc2-2 mutant seedlings grow quite similarly to WT plants, but flowering occurs later. Knockout of the NUC2 gene induces expression of some rDNA variants and hypermethylation of some sequences of pre-rRNA. In addition, NUC2 is required for the stability of rDNA variants' copy number (Durut et al., 2014). In this article, in a series of ground studies to complement space experiments, we have exposed A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) WT, nuc1-2 and nuc2-2 seedlings to two different illumination regimes at the beginning of the plant development (6 days from germination). In addition to highlighting the importance of Earth reference controls in spaceflight -omics experiments, our goal was to better understand the responses of nucleolin mutants to red light stimulation for further uses in space experiments under altered gravity conditions. The differential adaptive responses to the light are shown, suggesting that stress-related mutants may show a reduced response to environmental stress. In the long term, these results may lead to more efficient agriculture if an exaggerated response may reduce plant development under suboptimal environmental conditions.Results Overall Transcriptional Profile Effects Confirm a Suitable Quality of Plant Material and Clustering of the Replicates Two environmental conditions (light) are compared here, both of them as part of the SG Earth control reference experiment using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). Seedlings were germinated in the same spaceflight hardware during 4 days with a day/night cycle of illumination, and then half of the samples were exposed to 2 days of darkness and the other group to 2 days of continuous red light (Figure 1A). After 6 days growth in the culture chamber (CC), the experiment was completed and the phenotypes of the three mutants were observed (Figure 1B, Supplemental Information, Figure S1). Seedling growth was homogeneous within each cassette, with clearly smaller seedlings in the case of the nuc1-2 mutant. No clear phenotypical differences were observed in the root system physiology between darkness- and red light-stimulated samples (including the absence of red phototropism at 1g conditions). The phenotype was compared with a previous experiment with the same duration and genotypes but in petri dishes and with a 6-day photoperiod illumination profile (Manzano et al., 2020 submitted). Despite the effects of the TROPI cassette volume, the overall phenotype of the seedlings is also very similar in both studies. Figure 1.

All replicates are consistently grouped according to their experimental conditions, and two clear PC1 (for illumination conditions during the last 2 days of growth: darkness and red light) and PC2 (for genetic background: WT, nuc1-2, and nuc2-2) are observed.The quality of the replicates and overall similarities among the illumination regimes and different plants used is shown by principal-component analysis (PCA, Figure 1C and Supplemental Information, Data S1). First, a clear difference between the transcriptional profile of the WT, nuc1-2, and nuc2-2 plants exposed to darkness or red light photostimulation during the last 2 days of growth is shown by principal component 1 (PC1). Second, the differences between the genotypes can be observed in principal component 2 (PC2), where the nuc1-2 genotype has the most disrupted nucleolus phenotype, in that the nuc2-2 mutant is closer to the WT. The effect is clearer in the dark samples, because the red light stimulation produces more similarities among the three genotypes. Last, all the biological replicates included in the study cluster together according to the experimental condition, strengthening the statistical validity of the study. The use of three biological replicates (including up to 10 seedlings each) is enough considering the difficulties in increasing this number due to the availability of spaceflight research capabilities.Global Effect of Red Light Photostimulation Differs in Each Arabidopsis thaliana Line To understand the effect of the two lighting regimes (red light and darkness) on the transcriptional status, we compared seedlings with the differential illumination during the last 2 days of the plant growth period for each of the lines used (WT, nuc1-2, and nuc2-2). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the WT is 1,428 genes, of which 1,067 have their expression activated and 361 have it repressed. In the nuc1-2 mutant, the total number of DEGs is lower (1,001), mainly at the expense of the up-regulated genes (633 are over-expressed and 368 are repressed). The number of DEGs from the comparison (red light versus darkness) in the nuc2-2 mutant is very similar as in the WT: a total of 1,017 up-regulated genes and 339 down-regulated genes, making a total of 1,365 DEGs (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG p adj<0.05, Red Light Photostimulation versus Darkness) in WT and Nucleolin Mutants (nuc1-2 and nuc2-2) (A) Venn diagram comparing all DEGs and the five most significant gene ontology (GO Enrichment) categories in the common DEG in the three genotypes. (B) Venn diagram comparing up-regulated DEGs and the five most significant gene ontology (GO Enrichment) categories in the common DEGs in the WT and nuc2-2 genotypes and in the three genotypes, respectively. (C) Venn diagram comparing down-regulated DEGs and the five most significant gene ontology (GO Enrichment) categories from common DEGs in the three genotypes.Venn diagrams illustrate the group of DEGs that is affected in a single genotype or shared by others (Figure 2). Red light up-regulated genes affected only 298 genes in the WT, 134 genes in nuc1-2 mutant, and 199 genes for nuc2-2 mutant. On the other hand, the WT has 34 up-regulated genes in common with nuc1-2 but a large collection of 353 genes in common with nuc2-2 (note that the total number of up-regulated genes common for the three genotypes is 382), and only 83 genes for both nucleolin mutants (Figure 2B). Among DEGs down-regulated by the red light compared with the dark, there is a similar number of unique DEGs for each of them; 139 genes for the WT, 142 genes for the nuc1-2 mutant, and 104 genes for the nuc2-2 mutant. In this case, the number of DEGs down-regulated in the three lines is 125 genes, without any of the pair comparisons reaching that level (the nuc1-2 and nuc2-2 mutants have 44 and 53 genes in common with WT, respectively, whereas the two nucleolin mutants share 57 down-regulated genes, Figure 2C). In summary, the line with the least number of DEGs, when we compare plants illuminated with red light with those kept in darkness, is the nuc1-2 mutant. As the down-regulation response seems similar in all genotypes, the global effect is mainly due to a higher number of up-regulated DEGs in both nuc2-2 and WT genotypes. In fact, we can easily extrapolate from Figure 2B and compare the gene lists, including the common responses to red light (382 genes) and the list of up-regulated genes not detected in the nuc1-2 phenotype (353 genes). The main difference between these lists is shown by the functional analysis “GO Enrichment” included in Figure 2. All genotypes show the obvious photosynthesis/light-harvesting response together with increased Calvin cycle activity, but the nuc1-2 genotype is the only one lacking an increased secondary metabolism, together with a response to stress elements (cold) observed in both WT and nuc2-2. These results suggest that the presence of the NUC1 protein is necessary for the known effect of red light in the stimulation of cell proliferation, but the NUC2 protein is not an important player in that response. A complementary functional analysis has been done using the full lists of up- or down-regulated genes in each genotype, obtained by means of a Heatmap GO Enrichment. Up-regulated gene lists reveal that red light photostimulation versus darkness mainly leads to an unequivocal activation of genes involved in different phases of photosynthesis, together with processes that involve external encapsulation, secondary metabolism, and drug catabolism in all three A. thaliana lines examined (Supplemental Information, Figure S2A). Other significantly affected categories are the GO involving cell wall modification, pathogenesis, responses to insects, and defense mechanisms to bacteria. In addition to the mentioned GO groups, red light activates different biosynthetic processes (ketone, cutin, and small molecules) and the response to stimuli, such as cold and UV light, in the WT and nuc2-2 mutant lines. Solely in the WT line, an enrichment in cell division-related genes (microtubule-based movement, cell cycle, meiotic cell cycle) is produced. In the case of down-regulated GO groups, red light photostimulation reduces expression of genes involved in the response to different stimuli (temperature, hypoxia, light, abscisic acid, oxidative stress) as well as the circadian rhythm of plants (Supplemental Information, Figure S2B). Additional down-regulated genes involved in the response to stress appear in WT and nuc2-2 comparison (heat and osmotic stress), in the WT and nuc1-2 comparison (cold acclimation, response to karrikin, hormone metabolism, and cell wall modification), or nuc1-2 only (response to gibberellin). The two nucleolin mutant lines share a repression of the amino acid metabolism (alpha-amino acid catabolic process and leucine degradation).Dissecting Transcriptional Status for Each Genotype for Illumination Conditions at Normal Earth Gravity To better understand the differences in the transcriptional status of each genotype that could be attributed to the illumination conditions designed to be used in the SG spaceflight experiment, we performed a series of comparisons between the different lines, namely, nuc1-2 versus WT, nuc2-2 versus WT, and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2, when they are either photostimulated with red light or kept in darkness for 48 h, after a growth period of 4 days under a 16 h/8 h white light photoperiod regime (regular growth condition). The total number of DEGs when comparing the severe mutant nuc1-2 with the WT is remarkable, with thousands of genes affected in the different illumination conditions. A similar result was obtained in the comparison of nuc1-2 with nuc2-2. This number was much higher in the comparisons of the nuc1-2 mutant with both the Col-0 and nuc2-2 mutant in darkness: 3,363 genes and 2,121 genes, respectively. Under red light stimulation, the numbers dropped to half: 1,499 genes compared with the WT and 1,069 compared with nuc2-2, respectively. In contrast, the small number of DEGs between the WT and nuc2-2 mild mutant (just 149 genes in darkness conditions) peaked to 225 when red light photostimulation was provided (Figure 3). The up- and down-regulated genes showed similar trends in this case (Supplemental Information, Figure S3). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG p adj<0.05, in the Three Genotype Pair-Comparisons among WT, nuc1-2, and nuc2-2) within the Same Experimental Condition (A) Venn diagram comparing all DEGs between plants exposed to darkness the last 2 days. (B) Venn diagram comparing all DEGs between plants exposed to red light stimulation the last 2 days.The differential numbers in DEGs can be assigned to particular GO groups. Ontology analysis shows that both comparisons involving the nuc1 mutant in the darkness produced an increase in the expression of genes mainly involved in cell division, such as cell cycle, meiotic cell cycle, microtubule cytoskeleton, nuclear chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, and cell cycle-G2/M transition (Supplemental Information, Figure S4A). Furthermore, in the nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparisons, categories of responses to different stimuli, namely, responses to auxin, red light, gravity, and UV and ionizing radiations, also appeared overrepresented. In the comparison nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 in darkness, most functional categories (GO terms) appearing up-regulated in the nuc1-2 mutant are related to the cell wall (cell wall macromolecule catabolic process, pectin biosynthetic process), the cuticle (cuticle development and cutin, suberin, and wax biosyntheses), and the plasma membrane (anchored component of plasma membrane, very-long-chain fatty acid biosynthetic process, transmembrane receptor protein kinase activity). The up-regulated processes when red light is applied are quite different (Supplemental Information, Figure S4B). In the nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparisons, DEGs appeared involved in cell wall (structural constituents of cell wall) and in development (positive regulation of growth, post-embryonic plant morphogenesis, cellular response to ethylene stimulus). In the nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparison, many genes with a red-light-activated expression were involved in ribosome biogenesis (preribosome, maturation of SSU-rRNA, 90S preribosome, maturation of 5.8S RNA, ribosomal large subunit biogenesis). The two nucleolin mutant lines relative to WT (nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc2-2 versus WT comparisons) in conditions of red light photoactivation have up-regulated genes involved in different response processes, such as the responses to hypoxia, drug, antibiotic, salicylic acid, and wounding. The number of response processes was increased in the nuc2-2 versus WT comparison with the GO categories: responses to cold, bacterium, and abscisic acid. The identification of common gene categories down-regulated in both darkness and red light conditions was more challenging (Supplemental Information, Figures S4C and S4D). In darkness, nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparisons were very similar and mainly related to developmental processes (regulation post-embryonic development, meristem development, regulation of seed development, plant organ senescence), mRNA quality (mRNA surveillance pathway), response to temperature (response to temperature stimulus, endopeptidase Clp complex, heat shock protein), and immune system (immune response, response to toxic substance, glutathione metabolism). In the comparisons indicated above, genes involved in long-day photoperiodism, flowering, rhythmic process, and response to light intensity were also less represented. In the same way, cellular responses to light stimulus category was over-represented in both nucleolin mutants with respect to WT and responses to light stimulus was a common GO category in all three comparisons. The gene categories repressed only in the nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparison were involved in the spliceosome, protein demethylation, chromatin organization, mRNA binding, and histone acetyltransferase activity. The gene categories with repressed expression under red light for any of the comparisons (nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2) were related to mRNA splicing (alternative mRNA splicing via spliceosome), light responses (response to light stimulus, photoperiodism flowering, circadian rhythm), photosynthesis (chlorophyll biosynthesis process, chloroplast envelope), and the immune system (immune system process, defense response to bacterium, regulation of salicylic acid metabolic process, Supplemental Information, Figure S4D).Protein-Protein Interaction Networks Helps to Visualize the Differential Transcriptional State of nuc1-2 Genotype in 1g Control References Enrichment-PPI analysis (protein-protein interaction network) also showed that, in darkness, the mutant nuc1-2 has up-regulated the expression of genes involved in the regulation of G2/M transition of the mitotic cell cycle, mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, and auxin-activated signaling pathway, with respect to both the WT and the mutant nuc2-2 (Figure 4). In the down-regulation side, nuc1-2 mutant, when compared with WT, showed down-regulated genes involved in transcription regulator activity, sequence-specific DNA binding, defense response, and regulation of developmental process. In addition, the nuc1-2 mutant has genes with repressed expression in darkness condition related to negative regulation of circadian rhythm, responses to light stimulus, and responses to jasmonic acid, when compared with WT and nuc2-2 mutant (Figure 4). These results were in agreement with functional GO analysis (Supplemental Information, Figures S2 and S4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Protein-Protein Interaction Network of Nuc1-2 Differential Response under Darkness Conditions Enrichment network visualization for results from the over-represented gene lists in Nuc1-2 versus the other genotypes. Gene in each node is represented by a chart indicating the functional category to which each one belongs (following the color legend). The networks show that processes such as cell cycle (left part or up-regulated genes), circadian rhythms, and stress responses (right part or down-regulated genes) are already affected in the 1×g control conditions as a reference for the Seedling Growth spaceflight experiments.Discussion Results from Spaceflight Experiments Can Have Several Limitations that Are Not Often Present in Other Biological -Omics Works Major constraints of spaceflight experiments are the reduced amount of material and reproducibility, but other issues include the storage of samples before and after the experiment execution in space, causing staggered preparation and processing of the samples (Millar et al., 2010; Correll et al., 2013). In this work, we have shown that, using the spaceflight hardware and procedures, we can perform a transcriptomic analysis with enough reliability to describe the differential transcriptional state of the nucleolin mutants under different light conditions. Three replicates could be considered low for current standards for animal -omics studies in Earth, but in our experiment each replica already represents the average of 10 plants. We show here that the replicates expected to be collected from the spaceflight experiment can be estimated to be sufficient for performing a sequencing study that allows clustering of the different genotypes and environmental conditions (Figure 1). Due to logistical considerations, a specific constraint for plant space biology is the limited number of different mutants/genotypes that can be used in a spaceflight experiment in true microgravity. We have to be sure that the mutants of choice will provide valuable information. In that sense, the use of nucleolin mutants is a promising choice to provide insight into both the cell cycle and stress response mechanisms, apart from the ribosome biogenesis in which this protein is directly involved. These processes are known to be recurrently affected in space -omics experiments with plants (Choi et al., 2019; Ferl et al., 2015; Herranz et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2017; Kruse et al., 2017; Paul et al., 2013, 2017). The analysis performed here allows us to know the specific functions assumed by the two nucleolin proteins of A. thaliana (NUC1 and NUC2) in different environmental conditions, such as red light photostimulation and darkness, affecting tropistic stimuli. This information can be considered as the 1g reference control required to obtain the best possible understanding of the changes produced by the spaceflight conditions on plant development, and how the gravitational stress could be counteracted by changing phototropic stimuli. A longer-term goal is to use this knowledge for plant cultivation into bioregenerative life support systems.The Transcriptomic Baseline for Nucleolin Mutants Is Different under Red Light Photostimulation and Darkness Red light illumination mainly produces the activation of genes involved in photosynthesis, cell wall modification, drug catabolism, pathogenesis, and biotic stress response. Conversely, different abiotic stimuli responses (temperature, hypoxia, light, abscisic acid, oxidative stress) are down-regulated by the photostimulation treatment, as well as the circadian rhythm of plants. This transcriptional effect is similar in the three lines studied (Col-0 WT, nuc1-2, and nuc2-2), suggesting that it may be independent of the nucleolin protein functions. Therefore, the interpretation of transcriptional effects on plants' grown during spaceflight will be straightforward. In contrast, red light illumination produces a down-regulation of genes involved in the response to karritin, cold acclimation, and hormone metabolism in WT and nuc1-2, indicating that the NUC2 protein, and/or other proteins up-regulated in nuc1-2 (Pontvianne et al., 2007), could participate in these functions. In addition, in the nuc1-2 mutant, genes coding for response to gibberellin with the red light appear repressed. Gibberellin is a hormone involved in seed germination, bud and fruit formation, shoot longitudinal growth, and axial organ elongation (Hedden and Sponsel, 2015), which could support the relationship of defective plant growth and development with NUC1 gene disruption. Exposure to the dark during the last 2 days of cultivation of seedlings promotes gene categories mainly involved in processes of cell division and in the response to different stimuli (red light, UV, ionizing radiation, gravity, auxins). They are common in nuc1-2 versus WT and nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparisons and unique in nuc1-2 versus WT comparison. These observations could indicate that, in a stress condition such as darkness, the NUC2 protein is capable of rescuing functions that the NUC1 protein performs under normal growth conditions. Indeed, a role of nucleolin in mitosis has been reported (de Carcer and Medina, 1999; Ma et al., 2007). Therefore, in the nuc1 mutant, the NUC2 protein would be capable of performing functions necessary for plant survival, such as ribosome biogenesis regulation (Pontvianne et al., 2007), cell proliferation, and DNA repair. It is important to note that cell division GO was only significantly up represented in the WT when red light was provided (Figure 2B). In contrast, the gene categories down-regulated in darkness are mainly related to developmental processes, mRNA quality, response to temperature, and immune system. This may indicate that in the dark stress condition, the NUC2 protein is not capable of supplying the function of the NUC1 protein in these processes. These results, together with those previously described, indicate that the functional rescue of NUC1 by NUC2, when NUC1 is not expressed, would be only partial, which may be due to the structural difference between both proteins, including longer N-terminal acidic domain and less-conserved GAR domain I in the C terminal (Durut and Sáez-Vásquez, 2015).Differential Role of Nucleolin Mutants' Transcriptomic Baseline May Offer New Insight in Spaceflight Experiments Differential transcriptional response is observed when comparing the two nucleolin mutants. The categories of genes activated differentially in both mutants (nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparison) are mainly involved in the cell wall and membrane systems. This finding is potentially interesting in space -omics to discriminate gravitropism from graviresistance mechanisms (Herranz and Medina, 2014) and could be related to the phenotype described in the nuc1-2 mutant, in which a reduction in the cell number and a disorganization in every cell layer is observed in transversal sections of primary leaves (Pontvianne et al., 2007). Moreover, the gene categories repressed only in the above-mentioned comparison are involved in the spliceosome, protein demethylation, chromatin organization, mRNA binding, and histone acetyltransferase activity, which could be related to the described antagonist activity of these two proteins in pre-rRNA methylation and with their role in chromatin remodeling, RNA Pol I transcription, mRNA stability, and RNA/DNA metabolism (Pontvianne et al., 2010; Durut et al., 2014). In the nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2 comparison under red light photostimulation, the ribosome biogenesis GO shows the most significant enrichment within the up-regulated genes (Supplemental Information, Figure S4B). This result indicates that the described activating effect of red light in this process depends more on the expression of NUC2 protein than on the NUC1 expression. Ultimately, the two nucleolin mutant lines, compared with WT, have genes up-regulated by red light involved in different response processes, such as the response to hypoxia, drug, antibiotic, salicylic acid, and wounding. These response processes are extended in the nuc2-2 versus WT comparison, including response to cold, bacteria, and abscisic acid. These results indicate that even though both nucleolar proteins, NUC1 and NUC2, are involved in response processes, the implication of NUC2 is higher as to the number of processes. Therefore, NUC2 has a greater response capacity to environmental signals, such as illumination with red light, thus being more sensitive. A major challenge to be overcome in spaceflight -omics research is to differentiate and characterize which of the spaceflight environmental conditions (including not only microgravity and cosmic radiation but also the constraints imposed to the upload/download and storage processes in orbit, the gaseous atmosphere, among other factors) are responsible for each of the observed alterations in the transcriptome. According to our results, space -omics researchers need to pay special attention to the analysis of ground reference controls on Earth before conclusions can be made on the results obtained in spaceflight. In our particular example, the two nucleolin mutants are the perfect complement to the WT genotype to study how the NUC2 protein can replace the essential functions of NUC1 in orbit, and how light can modulate it, even rescuing WT transcriptional profiles in the nuc1-2 mutant. The fact that nuc2-2 mutant shows an increase in stress response GO when exposed to red light connects the red light stimulus with the modulation of the stress response. In parallel, the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis functions required to be restored in microgravity are also light dependent in both the nuc1-2 mutant (in Earth, as shown here) and the WT plants in orbit (Valbuena et al., 2018).Limitations of the Study Due to logistical constraints, this study lacks a continuously illuminated control set of samples performed simultaneously due to the absence of those samples in the spaceflight experiment as well as the reference experiment. The next step in this research is to analyze the samples from the space experiment in microgravity and the partial gravity conditions produced by the centrifuge in the EMCS on the ISS. We anticipate confirming that the duplicated nucleolin gene system works during spaceflight will lead us to discover novel mechanisms for plant adaptation to spaceflight conditions. Thus, this research will be eventually translated into better crops for life support systems in the human spaceflight ventures of the 21st century.Resource Availability Lead Contact Further information and requests for materials should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Raúl Herranz (r.herranz@csic.es)Materials Availability Materials generated in this study are available from the lead contact with a completed materials transfer agreement.Data and Code Availability The GLDS-313 datasets generated during this study have been deposited and it is available at GENELAB repository (Ray et al., 2019).

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as “water lentils” or “duckweed”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions.

    "introduction": "Introduction Wolffia globosa, commonly known as “water lentils” is a member of the Wolffoideae subfamily within the Lemnaceae family, shares similar biological traits with its Lemnoideae relatives: it is the smallest flowering plant and shows the fastest growth rate in the plant kingdom and lacks a pseudo root system1,2. Due to its rapid growth rate, high protein content, and nutritional value, it has emerged as a promising candidate for sustainable food production, particularly in agriculturally challenging regions3–6. This unique plant has recently garnered attention also as a potential bioregenerative life support system (BLSS) candidate7, offering traits that align with closed-loop, resource-efficient systems like those adopted for the ESA MELiSSA Loop8. Nevertheless, as for other candidate space crops9,10 to assess the suitability of Wolffia’s in space cultivation and its ability to recycle resources efficiently, further laboratory tests investigating growth, nutrition, and genetic responses under extreme conditions are fundamental7. Studying the effects of various stimuli, including different gravity environments, radiations, and their interactions, on the growth and development of plants can be challenging and costly7,11. Space limitations within onboard test facilities, such as the International Space Station or orbiting vectors, often restrict the number of replicates, making studies under these conditions even more demanding12–14. However, cost-effective alternatives exist in the form of facilities that simulate microgravity and partial gravity levels by continuously altering the gravitational vector15–17. These facilities offer higher replicate numbers and serve as robust testbeds for experiments involving different gravity levels18,19. Hypergravity, characterized by gravitational forces greater than Earth’s standard 1 g, is a significant factor in space exploration, affecting humans, and plant life20,21. Hypergravity is most prominent during the manuvers of take-off and landing phases of spacecraft. These brief yet intense episodes of increased gravitational force can influence various aspects of plant biology and growth21. Understanding how plants respond to hypergravity is essential for optimizing their cultivation in space environments and for Earth’s agriculture22,23. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights into the mechanisms plants employ to withstand and adapt to extreme gravitational conditions24,25. Earlier studies under simulated microgravity have shown stable anatomical morphology in Wolffia plants26, possible effects of hypergravity on plant growth and reproduction have not yet been investigated. Testing plant reactions of potential space crops under varying gravity levels, including those experienced during take-off, landing, or in partial gravities, is reported as crucial27. Consequently, exploring the adaptability of Wolffia plants under different gravitational conditions significantly contributes to our understanding of their potential7. Recent genome sequencing of Wolffia australiana has shed light on the gravity-sensing mechanisms and photomorphogenesis in Wolffia plants28,29. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia australiana, we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics. More specifically, we aim to study the effects of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphology of Wolffia globosa. Leveraging the capabilities of random positioning machines and large-diameter centrifuges, we simulated microgravity, partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity conditions to comprehensively explore the impact of varying gravitational environments on this plant species. These machines allow us to generate and study a range of gravity conditions, thereby elucidating Wolffia globosa's responses to these diverse gravity environments and assessing its potential utilisation in space-based food production systems.",

    "results": "Results Relative growth rate (RGR) The analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant difference (F = 16.47, p < 0.001) for the RGR among the different gravity treatments. The Eta-squared and Epsilon-squared effect sizes indicated a large effect of the treatments on the RGR (Eta-squared = 0.54, Epsilon-squared = 0.51). The post hoc 'Tukey's test, conducted to determine the specific differences between the treatments, showed that the simulated microgravity treatment (sim-µg) (mean difference = 0.33, p < 0.001) had a significantly lower RGR (Fig. 6) compared to the control treatment (1 g) (mean difference = 0.38 ± 0.02). The simulated Moon partial gravity treatment (sim-Moon g) also exhibited a lower RGR than the control treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant (mean difference = 0.36, p = 0.25). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Observed RGR across the different treatments. Graph shows the relative growth rate (RGR) resulting from the different gravities levels. Data refer to means ± SD of the means (N = 12). The letters on top of the bars describes the homogenous subsets calculated with the Tukey's post-hoc analysis.In contrast, hypergravity treatments (2 g and 4 g) showed higher RGR compared to the control treatment. However, there was no significant difference between the control and 2 g hypergravity treatments (mean difference = 0. 38, p = 0.99). The 4 g hypergravity treatment (4 g) showed the highest RGR among all treatments, however the difference was not statistically significant compared to the control treatment (mean difference = 0.39, p < 0.50). Furthermore, the doubling time is reported. The sim-µg treatment exhibited the longest doubling time of 2.18 days, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments with doubling times of 1.99, 1.83, 1.82, and 1.82 days, respectively (Fig. 7). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Observed DT across the different treatments. The graph shows the calculated doubling time-based on the RGR expressed in the different gravity levels. Data refer to means ± SD of the means N = 12. Morphological difference Analysis of the morphological characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds revealed differences in frond length among the gravity treatments. Resulting in a variation in the length of both short and long axes. Results of the ANOVA for the long side length showed a significant difference among gravity treatments (F = 17.34, p < 0.001). Results revealed that the fronds in the 1 g treatment exhibited the longest length (mean = 0.76 mm), followed by the sim-Moon g treatment (mean = 0.76 mm), the sim-µg treatment (mean = 0.75 mm), the 2 g treatment (mean = 0.73 mm), and the 4 g treatment (mean = 0.71 mm) (Fig. 8). Similarly, for the short side length, a significant main effect of gravity treatment was found (F = 5.349, p < 0.001). Post hoc tests showed that the fronds in the sim-µg treatment displayed the shortest length (mean = 0.56 mm), followed by the 4 g treatment (mean = 0.57 mm), the sim-Moon g treatment (mean = 0.57 mm), the 2 g treatment (mean = 0.58 mm), and the 1 g treatment (mean = 0.59 mm). These results suggest that the gravity environment significantly affects the morphological characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds, resulting in shorter (long axis) plants for those that exhibited the highest growth and vice versa. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Comparison between average long and short sides across different treatments. Graphs show the average length in mm of the long and short sides of different mother fronds across different gravity treatments. Data refer to means ± SD of the means, N = 100. The letters on top of the bars describe the homogenous subsets calculated with Tukey's post-hoc analysis.Analysis of the ratio in relation to the long side of Wolffia globosa fronds revealed significant differences among the different gravity treatments (F = 11.162, p < 0.001). Post hoc tests reported that the sim-µg treatment exhibited the highest ratio value (mean = 1.33), followed by the sim-Moon g treatment (mean = 1.32), the 1 g treatment (mean = 1.30), the 2 g treatment (mean = 1.27), and the 4 g treatment (mean = 1.26). These results suggest that the low gravity environment (sim-µg and sim-Moong) significantly impacts the ratio in relation to the long side of Wolffia globosa fronds (Fig. 9). Figure 9.

    "discussion": "Discussion The findings of this study shed light on the response of Wolffia globosa to altered gravitational conditions. While the results revealed some variations in growth and morphological traits among the different gravity treatments, these observations present exciting opportunities for further exploration and potential applications. In the realm of plant cultivation for space exploration (on orbital platforms, the Moon, and Mars), a more profound comprehension of plant reactions to altered gravitational conditions is essential16. Previous studies have shown various effects of microgravity on the growth of several plant species, but research on the effects of partial gravity and hypergravity on plants has been limited15,18. The aid of facilities such as RPMs and LDC can be the perfect testing ground before experimenting with true microgravity18,19 and testing the effect of different gravity levels on the performances of novel space crop species7. Plants grown under microgravity conditions manifest a slower growth rate compared to those grown under Earth’s gravity35. Results from our investigation show that simulated microgravity and simulated Moon gravity treatments resulted in slightly lower growth rates than the control treatment (Fig. 5). Although these differences, it is important to note that the relative growth rates observed in these treatments were still substantial, with the simulated microgravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.33 per day and the simulated Moon partial gravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.36 per day while it was 0.38 per day in the 1 g control plants. In addition, although reduced by the altered gravity conditions, growth rates of the Wolffia plants remain higher than those typically observed in other higher plant species36. Results from past experiments show the relative growth rate over a span of 40 days of lettuce grown under simulated microgravity, yielding a rate of 0.08/day37. The effects of altered gravity, especially microgravity (whether real or simulated), on higher plant species have been the subject of numerous scientific studies38. Wolffia globosa is the smallest higher plant, and its morphology is entirely distinct from other higher plants39. It doesn’t exhibit the typical morphology of roots, stems, and leaves but only has a frond that cannot be associated with any of the three main organs39. The results of previous studies on the effects of altered gravity on plant growth are not directly comparable to this species. Most of the research conducted focuses on the interactions between microgravity and roots10–12,14,21. Wolffia globosa is famously known as a rootless plant39. To further complicate matters, their rootless nature makes comparison with what has been studied so far challenging. Additionally, while microgravity has often been reported as a limiting growth factor for plants40–42, results from tests performed under hypergravity are disagreeing. Studies on the nucleolar activity or on the elongation of hypocotyls in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Cucumis sativus, showed a decrease in growth rates43,44. At the same time, other results suggest that hypergravity might not affect growth45. In our experiment, the 2g and 4g hypergravity treatments manifest an increasing (although not statistically significant) trend in growth rates compared to the control treatment (Fig. 6). This possible positive response to hypergravity treatments opens up interesting possibilities for future studies and potential applications in space agriculture but requires new ad hoc tests, eventually applying higher levels of hypergravity to amplify the phenomenon. In such a scenario, hypergravity conditions could be leveraged to enhance plant productivity and biomass accumulation in controlled environments, such as space stations. Considering that morphology plays a crucial role in plant growth, survival, and productivity46, we investigated the effect of different gravitational treatments on the shape of Wolffia globosa frond. Moreover, results revealed significant differences among the treatments for both the long and short sides. Worth mentioning that such an effect occurred on plants that can be considered genetically identical. The study findings revealed that the fronds of Wolffia globosa were most extended in the 1 g treatment, both on the front and back sides. Subsequently, the sim-Moon g, sim-µg, 2 g, and 4 g treatments followed in terms of frond length. These results suggest that both simulated microgravity and simulated Moon’s partial gravity have don’t have an impact on frond elongation. Furthermore, when analysing the ratio in relation to the longer side, significant differences were observed among the gravity treatments, indicating distinct frond shapes. The sim-µg treatment resulted in the most elongated frond shape, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments. These findings provide compelling evidence supporting the significant influence of gravity on the morphological characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds. The observed variations in frond length and shape among the treatments underscore the role of gravity in shaping plant growth and development. Specifically, the sim-µg treatment consistently induced the most pronounced changes, suggesting its potential as a key factor in determining frond morphology. These results contribute to our understanding of how different gravity environments impact the growth and shape of Wolffia globosa, highlighting the importance of considering gravity conditions in cultivating and manipulating these plants for various space applications. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving these morphological changes could provide valuable insights into the plant's ability to perceive and respond to gravitational cues. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa to altered gravity conditions suggested by our data hints at the potential use of plants from the genus Wolffia in space agriculture. These plants, characterised by rapid growth and high nutrient content, are strong candidates for food production in space, where resource constraints are critical7,13. Our findings further appraise the possible use of Wolffia globosa for space exploration and the establishment of sustainable agriculture in extraterrestrial environments. The robust growth and adaptability to altered gravity conditions can be added to the small size, rapid growth rate, and high nutrient content, confirming that this genus deserves consideration for cultivation in limited space and resource-constrained environments7. Although Wolffia globosa exhibited a reduced growth rate in our experiment under simulated microgravity, previous research has seen growth enactment of Wolffia globosa under simulated microgravity26. As already mentioned by the authors of the up-mentioned work, the enhanced growth might be linked to better utilisation of dissolved oxygen and organic substances in the growth medium due to the type of cultivation system they have employed26. The varying responses observed among different gravity treatments in our experiment could be attributed to the interplay between genetic variability within the Lemnaceae family and the specific environmental conditions experienced by each individual plant. Notably, the genus Wolffia comprises numerous species with significant genetic diversity. Testing the effects of altered gravity on only one clone of Wolffia globosa, as done in our experiment, provides a valuable starting point but may not fully capture the entire range of responses within the genus Wolffia. Further investigations involving multiple Wolffia species and clones are warranted to explore the full extent of the species' reaction to altered gravity and better understand the role of genetic variability in shaping their growth patterns. The recent sequencing of the genome of Wolffia australiana has provided valuable insights into the genetic characteristics of Wolffia species47. One intriguing finding is the absence of gravity-sensing genes commonly observed in higher plants. More specifically, new findings have shed light on the missing LAZY proteins in Wolffia australiana28. This genetic difference suggests that Wolffia species have evolved alternative mechanisms to perceive and respond to gravity cues, which may explain the distinct growth patterns exhibited under altered gravitational conditions.

Copyright notice ID: 10764921 PMID: 38172193 Abstract Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as “water lentils” or “duckweed”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions. Subject terms: Plant sciences, Light responses, Photosynthesis, Plant developmentIntroduction Wolffia globosa, commonly known as “water lentils” is a member of the Wolffoideae subfamily within the Lemnaceae family, shares similar biological traits with its Lemnoideae relatives: it is the smallest flowering plant and shows the fastest growth rate in the plant kingdom and lacks a pseudo root system1,2. Due to its rapid growth rate, high protein content, and nutritional value, it has emerged as a promising candidate for sustainable food production, particularly in agriculturally challenging regions3–6. This unique plant has recently garnered attention also as a potential bioregenerative life support system (BLSS) candidate7, offering traits that align with closed-loop, resource-efficient systems like those adopted for the ESA MELiSSA Loop8. Nevertheless, as for other candidate space crops9,10 to assess the suitability of Wolffia’s in space cultivation and its ability to recycle resources efficiently, further laboratory tests investigating growth, nutrition, and genetic responses under extreme conditions are fundamental7. Studying the effects of various stimuli, including different gravity environments, radiations, and their interactions, on the growth and development of plants can be challenging and costly7,11. Space limitations within onboard test facilities, such as the International Space Station or orbiting vectors, often restrict the number of replicates, making studies under these conditions even more demanding12–14. However, cost-effective alternatives exist in the form of facilities that simulate microgravity and partial gravity levels by continuously altering the gravitational vector15–17. These facilities offer higher replicate numbers and serve as robust testbeds for experiments involving different gravity levels18,19. Hypergravity, characterized by gravitational forces greater than Earth’s standard 1 g, is a significant factor in space exploration, affecting humans, and plant life20,21. Hypergravity is most prominent during the manuvers of take-off and landing phases of spacecraft. These brief yet intense episodes of increased gravitational force can influence various aspects of plant biology and growth21. Understanding how plants respond to hypergravity is essential for optimizing their cultivation in space environments and for Earth’s agriculture22,23. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights into the mechanisms plants employ to withstand and adapt to extreme gravitational conditions24,25. Earlier studies under simulated microgravity have shown stable anatomical morphology in Wolffia plants26, possible effects of hypergravity on plant growth and reproduction have not yet been investigated. Testing plant reactions of potential space crops under varying gravity levels, including those experienced during take-off, landing, or in partial gravities, is reported as crucial27. Consequently, exploring the adaptability of Wolffia plants under different gravitational conditions significantly contributes to our understanding of their potential7. Recent genome sequencing of Wolffia australiana has shed light on the gravity-sensing mechanisms and photomorphogenesis in Wolffia plants28,29. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia australiana, we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics. More specifically, we aim to study the effects of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphology of Wolffia globosa. Leveraging the capabilities of random positioning machines and large-diameter centrifuges, we simulated microgravity, partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity conditions to comprehensively explore the impact of varying gravitational environments on this plant species. These machines allow us to generate and study a range of gravity conditions, thereby elucidating Wolffia globosa's responses to these diverse gravity environments and assessing its potential utilisation in space-based food production systems.Materials and methods Plant material and cultivation Plants of Wolffia globosa (9910) have been provided by Prof. Klaus Apperoth from the Department of Plant Physiology of the University of Jena, Germany. Upon receive, plant material was surface sterilised with 0.3% bleach/water solution for 5 min30. After 14 days from disinfection, plants were subcultured for 30 days in N-medium30 under axenic conditions. Therefore, plant material has been transferred under a laminar flow hood in sets of 6-well plates, each filled with 5 ml of N-medium solution and sealed with micropore® tape. Before the experimental run, plants were acclimatised for 24 h at 30 °C. After acclimatisation, an average of 20 ± 4 fronds were transferred in each well of a 6-multiwell plate previously filled with 5 ml of N-medium and 0.8% of Agar to achieve a semi-solid substrate. The experiment was conducted at 30 ± 0.5 °C average temperature with a photoperiod of 16/8 h light/dark and a total Photon Flux Density (PFD) of 72.37 ± 10.30 μmol m−2 s−1 for 168 h2. Carbon dioxide concentration has been monitored throughout the experiment, resulting in an average concentration of 303 ± 34 ppm.Hardware description and dimensions Experimental hardware has been developed to hold two multiwell plates in a setup that minimises the gravity gradient between the upper and lower multiwell plates. Furthermore, the experimental hardware had to be designed to fit in most test facilities, setting the lower constraints to an overall dimension of 15*15*15 cm of the smallest Random Positioning Machine (RPM) available.. Considering these constraints, we designed and developed the experimental hardware using the free available software SketchUp® (Fig. 1). Due to the constraints described before, multiwell plates had to be stacked vertically. This setup minimises the distance of the two centres of mass of both multiwells so that the difference in acceleration can be neglected. The experimental hardware has been equipped with LED white light (Goming LTD) to ensure proper plant development. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental hardware: (A) In the Front view, the black arrows show the LED light strips, the star shapes marks the biological containers (multiwell plates), and the triangular shape marks the base plate of the experimental hardware. (B) Assembled hardware from a back view, the red arrows points at the 30 mm fan re-circulating air within the experimental hardware.Furthermore, 3 cm 5 V fans have been added to the experimental hardware to increase uniformity between the temperature inside and outside the experimental hardware (Fig. 1). The prototype of the experimental hardware has been built in plywood. Plywood has been laser cut, and parts have been glued in place with vinyl glue. The template for laser cutting can be found in supplementary material Appendix A. Nevertheless, the experimental hardware can be 3D printed in any plastic material, and information for the 3D model can be found on the directory: GitHub. The inner dimension of each experimental hardware is designed to fit a multiwell plate of standard dimensions (12.7 × 8.5 × 2.2 cm). From the multiwell lid to the lighting system, a fixed distance of 2.0 cm has been set up to guarantee optimal light intensity for plant growth. The experimental hardware's design and dimensions are reported below (Fig. 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Experimental hardware, with the exact dimensions of every component.Lighting system Light treatment has been achieved utilising two 10 cm 5 V LED stripes illuminating each multiwell plate (Fig. 1). Via USB connector, the light was connected to a Wi-Fi USB switch that controlled the lighting system and photoperiod to a 16/8 light/dark cycle. Light emission spectrum has been determined with a spectroradiometer (SS-110, Apogee Instruments Inc.) measuring in six different positions within the experimental hardware (N = 6) in a wavelength range of 340–820 nm. A more detailed composition of the light spectrum is described in Table 1 and Fig. 3. Table 1. Light measurements.

Dotted lines limit the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).Gravity treatments The study encompassed four different gravity treatments: simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and two levels of hypergravity (2g ad 4g). In addition, a control group under Earth gravity conditions was included for comparison (Fig. 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Experimental hardware implementation. The different images show the implementation of the experimental hardware in the different gravity treatments. (A) RPM simulated partial gravity (Moon) (B) Simulated microgravity (sim-µg) (c) LDC gondola implemented with the experimental hardware within the LDC.Simulated microgravity (sim-µg) was achieved using an RPM (Random Positioning Machine, original Dutch Space Leiden, NL; currently Yuri Space, Meckenbeuren, DE) that allowed the plants to be positioned within 10 cm from the centre of rotation. The RPM was set to a maximum random speed of 60 °/s, minimising residual acceleration31. RPM was also set to random interval and random direction. Simulated Partial gravity (Moon) (sim-Moon) was simulated using a similar RPM, which was running a different program which does not provide a complete random rotation during the experiment but generates vector orientations and values that are biased such that the averaged resulted gravity vector simulates the Moon. This proprietary software generated motion can enabled the examination of plant responses to partial gravity ranging from nearly zero to 0.9 g levels27. Hypergravity conditions were obtained using the large-diameter centrifuge (LDC)32. Two hypergravity levels were tested: 2g and 4g, corresponding to twice and four times the gravitational force on Earth, respectively. These conditions allowed investigation of how Wolffia globosa responded to increased gravitational forces. A control group was included, where plants were grown under normal gravity conditions (1g) in a static gondola. This control group served as a baseline for comparing the growth and morphology of Wolffia globosa under different gravity treatments. The experimental setup and the number of replicates for each treatment are summarised in Table 2: Table 2. Gravity treatments and replicates.

Two imaging setups were used: Camera Setup: a Sony Alpha II camera with an 18–70 mm objective was fixed to a camera stand. It captured top-down images of the multiwell plate placed on a lighting table with a white semi-transparent Polyvinyl chloride panel illuminated by an LED light panel, ensuring uniform lighting conditions. The images thaken with this setup were used to evaluate growth. Morespecificaly, the relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated by comparing the area occupied by the plants in pixels at the start of the experiment (t0) and after 168 h (t168). Doubling time (DT) was determined based on RGR. Stereo Microscope Setup: detailed morphological analysis was performed using a Leica® MZ8 Stereo zoom Microscope. Images representing replicates for each treatment were captured. Images acquired with the steromicroscope were used to evaluate the morphological traits of Wolffia globosa were compared among gravity treatments. Morphological traits, such as the dimensions of the long and short axes of the mother fronds, were measured using Fiji® software. Ratios between the long and short axes of the mother fronds were also calculated to assess frond roundness. Image analysis has been performed on the images gathered during the experimental run. Two types of analysis have been conducted: (1) Analysis of the growth parameters (RGR and DT) (2) Analysis of the morphological differences. RGR has been calculated by comparing the area expressed in pixels occupied by the plant at two-time intervals (N = 12). Images were analysed using the ilastik® software described by Romano et al.33. We calculated DT based on RGR as described by Naumann34. To perform morphological comparison among treatments, one hundred mother fronds have been randomly selected throughout the different wells of the same multiwell plate within the same treatment. For coherent results, a phenological standard was determined. We have measured only mother fronds that had a well-formed daughter frond still attached. Morphological traits have been evaluated by measuring the long and short side of the mother frond. Long and short side have been always measured as shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, we have evaluated the existing ratios with respect to the long side between these two measurements (N = 100)26 (Fig. 5). Measurements have been taken utilising Fiji® software. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Wolffia globosa plant. The dotted line divides the daughter frond (DF) from the mother frond (MF). The (LS) arrow shows the long side, and the (SS) arrow shows the short side.Image analysis data were processed and analysed using SPSS Statistics ver. 21 (IBM Corp.). Differences in growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa among gravity treatments was assessed by one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05). Pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey's post-hoc test (P < 0.05) to identify differences among individual treatments.IUCN policy statement Experimental studies and field research on plants (cultivated or wild), including the collection of plant material, must comply with relevant institutional, national and international guidelines and legislation. We will strictly adhere to the IUCN Policy Statement on Research on Endangered Species and the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Prof. Klaus Apperoth provided specimens in this utilised in this study from the Department of Plant Physiology of the University of Jena, Germany and are available in the collection of the up mentioned university. We confirm compliance with the IUCN policy for plant.Results Relative growth rate (RGR) The analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant difference (F = 16.47, p < 0.001) for the RGR among the different gravity treatments. The Eta-squared and Epsilon-squared effect sizes indicated a large effect of the treatments on the RGR (Eta-squared = 0.54, Epsilon-squared = 0.51). The post hoc 'Tukey's test, conducted to determine the specific differences between the treatments, showed that the simulated microgravity treatment (sim-µg) (mean difference = 0.33, p < 0.001) had a significantly lower RGR (Fig. 6) compared to the control treatment (1 g) (mean difference = 0.38 ± 0.02). The simulated Moon partial gravity treatment (sim-Moon g) also exhibited a lower RGR than the control treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant (mean difference = 0.36, p = 0.25). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Observed RGR across the different treatments. Graph shows the relative growth rate (RGR) resulting from the different gravities levels. Data refer to means ± SD of the means (N = 12). The letters on top of the bars describes the homogenous subsets calculated with the Tukey's post-hoc analysis.In contrast, hypergravity treatments (2 g and 4 g) showed higher RGR compared to the control treatment. However, there was no significant difference between the control and 2 g hypergravity treatments (mean difference = 0. 38, p = 0.99). The 4 g hypergravity treatment (4 g) showed the highest RGR among all treatments, however the difference was not statistically significant compared to the control treatment (mean difference = 0.39, p < 0.50). Furthermore, the doubling time is reported. The sim-µg treatment exhibited the longest doubling time of 2.18 days, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments with doubling times of 1.99, 1.83, 1.82, and 1.82 days, respectively (Fig. 7). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Observed DT across the different treatments. The graph shows the calculated doubling time-based on the RGR expressed in the different gravity levels. Data refer to means ± SD of the means N = 12.Morphological difference Analysis of the morphological characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds revealed differences in frond length among the gravity treatments. Resulting in a variation in the length of both short and long axes. Results of the ANOVA for the long side length showed a significant difference among gravity treatments (F = 17.34, p < 0.001). Results revealed that the fronds in the 1 g treatment exhibited the longest length (mean = 0.76 mm), followed by the sim-Moon g treatment (mean = 0.76 mm), the sim-µg treatment (mean = 0.75 mm), the 2 g treatment (mean = 0.73 mm), and the 4 g treatment (mean = 0.71 mm) (Fig. 8). Similarly, for the short side length, a significant main effect of gravity treatment was found (F = 5.349, p < 0.001). Post hoc tests showed that the fronds in the sim-µg treatment displayed the shortest length (mean = 0.56 mm), followed by the 4 g treatment (mean = 0.57 mm), the sim-Moon g treatment (mean = 0.57 mm), the 2 g treatment (mean = 0.58 mm), and the 1 g treatment (mean = 0.59 mm). These results suggest that the gravity environment significantly affects the morphological characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds, resulting in shorter (long axis) plants for those that exhibited the highest growth and vice versa. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Comparison between average long and short sides across different treatments. Graphs show the average length in mm of the long and short sides of different mother fronds across different gravity treatments. Data refer to means ± SD of the means, N = 100. The letters on top of the bars describe the homogenous subsets calculated with Tukey's post-hoc analysis.Analysis of the ratio in relation to the long side of Wolffia globosa fronds revealed significant differences among the different gravity treatments (F = 11.162, p < 0.001). Post hoc tests reported that the sim-µg treatment exhibited the highest ratio value (mean = 1.33), followed by the sim-Moon g treatment (mean = 1.32), the 1 g treatment (mean = 1.30), the 2 g treatment (mean = 1.27), and the 4 g treatment (mean = 1.26). These results suggest that the low gravity environment (sim-µg and sim-Moong) significantly impacts the ratio in relation to the long side of Wolffia globosa fronds (Fig. 9). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Long side ratio of the measured mother fronds across different treatments. Data refer to means ± SD of the means, N = 50. The letters on top of the bars describes the homogenous subsets calculated with the Tukey’s post-hoc analysis.Discussion The findings of this study shed light on the response of Wolffia globosa to altered gravitational conditions. While the results revealed some variations in growth and morphological traits among the different gravity treatments, these observations present exciting opportunities for further exploration and potential applications. In the realm of plant cultivation for space exploration (on orbital platforms, the Moon, and Mars), a more profound comprehension of plant reactions to altered gravitational conditions is essential16. Previous studies have shown various effects of microgravity on the growth of several plant species, but research on the effects of partial gravity and hypergravity on plants has been limited15,18. The aid of facilities such as RPMs and LDC can be the perfect testing ground before experimenting with true microgravity18,19 and testing the effect of different gravity levels on the performances of novel space crop species7. Plants grown under microgravity conditions manifest a slower growth rate compared to those grown under Earth’s gravity35. Results from our investigation show that simulated microgravity and simulated Moon gravity treatments resulted in slightly lower growth rates than the control treatment (Fig. 5). Although these differences, it is important to note that the relative growth rates observed in these treatments were still substantial, with the simulated microgravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.33 per day and the simulated Moon partial gravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.36 per day while it was 0.38 per day in the 1 g control plants. In addition, although reduced by the altered gravity conditions, growth rates of the Wolffia plants remain higher than those typically observed in other higher plant species36. Results from past experiments show the relative growth rate over a span of 40 days of lettuce grown under simulated microgravity, yielding a rate of 0.08/day37. The effects of altered gravity, especially microgravity (whether real or simulated), on higher plant species have been the subject of numerous scientific studies38. Wolffia globosa is the smallest higher plant, and its morphology is entirely distinct from other higher plants39. It doesn’t exhibit the typical morphology of roots, stems, and leaves but only has a frond that cannot be associated with any of the three main organs39. The results of previous studies on the effects of altered gravity on plant growth are not directly comparable to this species. Most of the research conducted focuses on the interactions between microgravity and roots10–12,14,21. Wolffia globosa is famously known as a rootless plant39. To further complicate matters, their rootless nature makes comparison with what has been studied so far challenging. Additionally, while microgravity has often been reported as a limiting growth factor for plants40–42, results from tests performed under hypergravity are disagreeing. Studies on the nucleolar activity or on the elongation of hypocotyls in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Cucumis sativus, showed a decrease in growth rates43,44. At the same time, other results suggest that hypergravity might not affect growth45. In our experiment, the 2g and 4g hypergravity treatments manifest an increasing (although not statistically significant) trend in growth rates compared to the control treatment (Fig. 6). This possible positive response to hypergravity treatments opens up interesting possibilities for future studies and potential applications in space agriculture but requires new ad hoc tests, eventually applying higher levels of hypergravity to amplify the phenomenon. In such a scenario, hypergravity conditions could be leveraged to enhance plant productivity and biomass accumulation in controlled environments, such as space stations. Considering that morphology plays a crucial role in plant growth, survival, and productivity46, we investigated the effect of different gravitational treatments on the shape of Wolffia globosa frond. Moreover, results revealed significant differences among the treatments for both the long and short sides. Worth mentioning that such an effect occurred on plants that can be considered genetically identical. The study findings revealed that the fronds of Wolffia globosa were most extended in the 1 g treatment, both on the front and back sides. Subsequently, the sim-Moon g, sim-µg, 2 g, and 4 g treatments followed in terms of frond length. These results suggest that both simulated microgravity and simulated Moon’s partial gravity have don’t have an impact on frond elongation. Furthermore, when analysing the ratio in relation to the longer side, significant differences were observed among the gravity treatments, indicating distinct frond shapes. The sim-µg treatment resulted in the most elongated frond shape, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments. These findings provide compelling evidence supporting the significant influence of gravity on the morphological characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds. The observed variations in frond length and shape among the treatments underscore the role of gravity in shaping plant growth and development. Specifically, the sim-µg treatment consistently induced the most pronounced changes, suggesting its potential as a key factor in determining frond morphology. These results contribute to our understanding of how different gravity environments impact the growth and shape of Wolffia globosa, highlighting the importance of considering gravity conditions in cultivating and manipulating these plants for various space applications. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving these morphological changes could provide valuable insights into the plant's ability to perceive and respond to gravitational cues. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa to altered gravity conditions suggested by our data hints at the potential use of plants from the genus Wolffia in space agriculture. These plants, characterised by rapid growth and high nutrient content, are strong candidates for food production in space, where resource constraints are critical7,13. Our findings further appraise the possible use of Wolffia globosa for space exploration and the establishment of sustainable agriculture in extraterrestrial environments. The robust growth and adaptability to altered gravity conditions can be added to the small size, rapid growth rate, and high nutrient content, confirming that this genus deserves consideration for cultivation in limited space and resource-constrained environments7. Although Wolffia globosa exhibited a reduced growth rate in our experiment under simulated microgravity, previous research has seen growth enactment of Wolffia globosa under simulated microgravity26. As already mentioned by the authors of the up-mentioned work, the enhanced growth might be linked to better utilisation of dissolved oxygen and organic substances in the growth medium due to the type of cultivation system they have employed26. The varying responses observed among different gravity treatments in our experiment could be attributed to the interplay between genetic variability within the Lemnaceae family and the specific environmental conditions experienced by each individual plant. Notably, the genus Wolffia comprises numerous species with significant genetic diversity. Testing the effects of altered gravity on only one clone of Wolffia globosa, as done in our experiment, provides a valuable starting point but may not fully capture the entire range of responses within the genus Wolffia. Further investigations involving multiple Wolffia species and clones are warranted to explore the full extent of the species' reaction to altered gravity and better understand the role of genetic variability in shaping their growth patterns. The recent sequencing of the genome of Wolffia australiana has provided valuable insights into the genetic characteristics of Wolffia species47. One intriguing finding is the absence of gravity-sensing genes commonly observed in higher plants. More specifically, new findings have shed light on the missing LAZY proteins in Wolffia australiana28. This genetic difference suggests that Wolffia species have evolved alternative mechanisms to perceive and respond to gravity cues, which may explain the distinct growth patterns exhibited under altered gravitational conditions. Furthermore, to some degree, the enhanced growth rate seen under the hypergravity treatment could be attributed to gravity resistance genes such as PTH248. Our results partially confirmed the expected limited reaction to gravity also of Wolffia globosa. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa to different gravitational conditions supported the hypothesis that the loss of gravity-sensing genes reported in the sister species Wolffia australiana might also occur in Wolffia globosa. The slight variations in growth rates and morphological traits observed among the treatments open up interesting avenues for future research and potential applications in space agriculture. In addition to its implications for space agriculture, this research also contributes to our understanding of fundamental plant biology. The findings of our experiment might encourage further investigations to clarify the evolutionary pathways that shaped the peculiar adaptation to gravity associated to a return to an ancestral aquatic environment of Wolffia genus.Supplementary Information Supplementary Information 1.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction We have recently commemorated the 50th anniversary of the first time that a human being stepped on the surface of the Moon, the first terrestrial body outside the Earth in receiving humans. Nowadays, fifty years after Astronaut Armstrong’s epic achievement, space exploration by humans is commonly recognized as an exciting and attractive challenge and a powerful booster for scientific and technological progress in order to improve human life on Earth [1]. This is true despite some minor criticisms that question the high costs that it entails [2]. The establishment of permanent settlements in the Moon and Mars is becoming a realistic possibility in the near future. After a decade of successful rover explorations to the surface of Mars [3], both ESA and NASA, and more recently, the agencies from growing economies in Asian countries, are working to promote a human mission, first to the Moon, and then to Mars. The objectives of deep space exploration by humans, including of the Moon and Mars, require the implementation of a complex system of life support for space explorers, capable of supplying the elements necessary for sustaining their life (oxygen, food, moisture, etc.) and of removing their waste products. The system needs to be bioregenerative, i.e., the components need to self-regenerate without the addition of new elements brought from Earth, and energy-efficient, only using the power sources available in space. Plants are a candidate to occupy a key position in these bioregenerative life support systems (BLSSs). They are indeed being used in all the initiatives tested currently, such as MELiSSA—Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative [4,5]. There is no doubt that plants must accompany humans in space exploration ventures, because they offer the potential to provide food, replenish the air, filter water, and improve the psychological wellbeing of the crew during long-duration missions in space. The achievement of a true “space agriculture” is a fundamental objective of this global enterprise, and the advances in this task are already producing substantial benefits for the efficiency and sustainability of the terrestrial agriculture [6,7]. The existence of “Martian greenhouses” is an image that appears to be more common to the public eye. In these greenhouses, plants could be provided with the necessary environmental elements to enable their development. These elements include light, water, temperature, oxygen, CO2, and aeration, in addition, obviously, to a substrate in which to anchor, from which the plant will take nutrients through its roots. Apart from anchoring the root, the substrate (e.g., soil) has to be capable of sustaining root development. Some published experiments have demonstrated that terrestrial plants can grow in an analogue of lunar soil or Martian soil, provided that this substrate is supplemented with additional elements and substances that provide the plant with the water, mineral salts, and nutrients that it needs for its survival and development [8]. Recently, plants have been grown in real Lunar regoliths brought back by Apollo missions, showing that the Lunar regolith is capable of supporting plant growth; however, it is not certainly the best substrate, because some stress was generated in samples grown on it [9]. In addition to the issues originated by the alien soils and the supply of the environmental conditions required for the growth of terrestrial plants, two important adverse factors need to be counteracted. These are the gravity level, different from the Earth value (microgravity—near 0 g—in orbit, 0.17 g for the Moon surface, and 0.38 g for the Mars surface) and the existence of cosmic radiation. These two are the only environmental factors that are unavoidable and unable to be counteracted using technological solutions or elements available on Earth. Moreover, plants have not encountered these conditions throughout their evolutionary history. Thus, the cultivation of plants in spaceflight, as well as on the Moon and Mars, requires that the specimens to be cultivated become adapted to grow and develop in the presence of these two environmental factors. To achieve this objective, we first need a full understanding of the biological mechanisms of response and adaptation to conditions of the spaceflight environment. Obviously, the development of technological countermeasures or the use of biological strategies that would mitigate the unfavorable impact of gravity and radiation is a complementary strategy to consider.",

Conclusions and Future Prospects The SG series of experiments has constituted a significant contribution to furthering the knowledge of alterations induced by the space environment, specifically by microgravity and different levels of partial gravity, on the physiology of plants. Investigations have focused on the earliest stages of plant development, and a variety of cellular and molecular (transcriptomic) parameters have been studied. Among the key findings of our spaceflight project are the new results on phototropism induced by red and blue light illumination, the effect of red light illumination in counteracting the adverse effects of altered gravity, and the discovery that Moon gravity could trigger more severe transcriptomic responses than spaceflight. However, we also observed that Mars gravity is capable of inducing the gravitropic orientation of roots, and the different responses to the space environment of the various mutants used, suggesting that the selection of plants for their culture in alien environments should require prior detailed analysis of their genotypes in order to select the varieties capable of adapting better. The SG experiments have been among the first in performing a comparative analysis, using microgravity, different levels of partial gravity (including Moon and Mars gravity), and an on-board 1 g control in flight. This has been possible due to the use of the EMCS incubator, equipped with centrifuges providing this capacity. Unfortunately, the EMCS was decommissioned in 2018 and not replaced by any other spaceflight facility with these exact capabilities. The novel advanced NASA incubators for plant culture, Veggie, APH, and X-ROOTS, do not allow for these comparative studies at different gravity levels, which are of the highest importance. In the immediate future, in our next studies, we should incorporate other space environmental factor that, along with gravity, is key to the survival of living beings and particularly of plants: radiation. Fortunately, there are experiments under development in different laboratories, including ours, and different devices and facilities providing the simultaneous application of radiation and different levels of simulated microgravity and partial gravity for experimental analyses. In addition, we need to extend the cellular and molecular studies on plant adaptation to the space environment, such as SG, to the use of crop species. NASA is actively promoting plant studies on the ISS using the aforementioned spaceflight incubators Veggie, APH, and X-ROOTS, but this activity is basically oriented to nutritional aspects, without giving the necessary priority to fundamental studies at cellular and molecular level. Surprisingly, the activity of ESA in plant biology studies has been relatively slow after completion of the SG project. Obviously, the decommission of EMCS, an ESA facility, has been an important factor, but not the only one. There is an ongoing project to adapt the Biolab, a seriously underused spaceflight facility, to plant experiments of this type. It is vital that Europe regains the initiative in this research area as soon as possible, and thus again being able to play a relevant role in meeting the need for an effective culture of plants in space. Nowadays, this need, as a key human life support mechanism in space exploration, is becoming more and more urgent.",

Introduction We have recently commemorated the 50th anniversary of the first time that a human being stepped on the surface of the Moon, the first terrestrial body outside the Earth in receiving humans. Nowadays, fifty years after Astronaut Armstrong’s epic achievement, space exploration by humans is commonly recognized as an exciting and attractive challenge and a powerful booster for scientific and technological progress in order to improve human life on Earth [1]. This is true despite some minor criticisms that question the high costs that it entails [2]. The establishment of permanent settlements in the Moon and Mars is becoming a realistic possibility in the near future. After a decade of successful rover explorations to the surface of Mars [3], both ESA and NASA, and more recently, the agencies from growing economies in Asian countries, are working to promote a human mission, first to the Moon, and then to Mars. The objectives of deep space exploration by humans, including of the Moon and Mars, require the implementation of a complex system of life support for space explorers, capable of supplying the elements necessary for sustaining their life (oxygen, food, moisture, etc.) and of removing their waste products. The system needs to be bioregenerative, i.e., the components need to self-regenerate without the addition of new elements brought from Earth, and energy-efficient, only using the power sources available in space. Plants are a candidate to occupy a key position in these bioregenerative life support systems (BLSSs). They are indeed being used in all the initiatives tested currently, such as MELiSSA—Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative [4,5]. There is no doubt that plants must accompany humans in space exploration ventures, because they offer the potential to provide food, replenish the air, filter water, and improve the psychological wellbeing of the crew during long-duration missions in space. The achievement of a true “space agriculture” is a fundamental objective of this global enterprise, and the advances in this task are already producing substantial benefits for the efficiency and sustainability of the terrestrial agriculture [6,7]. The existence of “Martian greenhouses” is an image that appears to be more common to the public eye. In these greenhouses, plants could be provided with the necessary environmental elements to enable their development. These elements include light, water, temperature, oxygen, CO2, and aeration, in addition, obviously, to a substrate in which to anchor, from which the plant will take nutrients through its roots. Apart from anchoring the root, the substrate (e.g., soil) has to be capable of sustaining root development. Some published experiments have demonstrated that terrestrial plants can grow in an analogue of lunar soil or Martian soil, provided that this substrate is supplemented with additional elements and substances that provide the plant with the water, mineral salts, and nutrients that it needs for its survival and development [8]. Recently, plants have been grown in real Lunar regoliths brought back by Apollo missions, showing that the Lunar regolith is capable of supporting plant growth; however, it is not certainly the best substrate, because some stress was generated in samples grown on it [9]. In addition to the issues originated by the alien soils and the supply of the environmental conditions required for the growth of terrestrial plants, two important adverse factors need to be counteracted. These are the gravity level, different from the Earth value (microgravity—near 0 g—in orbit, 0.17 g for the Moon surface, and 0.38 g for the Mars surface) and the existence of cosmic radiation. These two are the only environmental factors that are unavoidable and unable to be counteracted using technological solutions or elements available on Earth. Moreover, plants have not encountered these conditions throughout their evolutionary history. Thus, the cultivation of plants in spaceflight, as well as on the Moon and Mars, requires that the specimens to be cultivated become adapted to grow and develop in the presence of these two environmental factors. To achieve this objective, we first need a full understanding of the biological mechanisms of response and adaptation to conditions of the spaceflight environment. Obviously, the development of technological countermeasures or the use of biological strategies that would mitigate the unfavorable impact of gravity and radiation is a complementary strategy to consider.2. Altered Gravity/Microgravity Disturbs Plant Growth Plant seeds were, strictly speaking, the first organisms in space, launched on a U.S. V-2 rocket in 1946, representing some early suborbital biological experiments handled by Harvard University and the Naval Research Laboratory [10]. Later, in 1966, the Soviet Kosmos 110 was launched, carrying two dogs and moisturized seeds; some of the seeds actually germinated. However, the first scientific experiment consisting of growing plants in space was carried out within the Oasis 1 hardware aboard the spacecraft Salyut 1 in 1971 [11], (reviewed by [12]). Then, experiments were performed on facilities installed in the NASA Space Shuttle, or on the Soviet MIR Station. As for space research in general, investigations on the response of plants to the space environment were significantly boosted after the assembly and operation of the International Space Station (ISS) [13]. In parallel, similar plant growth experiments on Earth, using ground-based facilities for microgravity simulation, such as clinostats and random positioning machines (RPMs), have successfully been performed [14,15]. In general, depending on the parameters studied, these have provided a reliable replica of the biological results obtained in space experiments under real microgravity, even though the gravity vector cannot possibly be avoided or removed on the Earth’s surface [15,16,17]. Only drop-towers provide a real microgravity on Earth, but the period of time for which the microgravity condition is generated in them is limited to just a few seconds [18], which is too short for plant research. Parabolic flights also provide a real microgravity for experimentation, but it is preceded by a period of hypergravity [19], which may alter the way an organism responds to microgravity. Suborbital flights, especially sounding rockets, have successfully been used for exposing plants to microgravity for limited periods of time (i.e., in the order of minutes) [13,20]. The main conclusion obtained from pioneering space experiments in orbit was that plants could survive and grow in space, although alterations were soon reported [21,22]. The results were sometimes contradictory, in most cases due to deficiencies in the experimental setup and the devices used to germinate seeds and grow plants. Major improvements in culture facilities have allowed us to conclude that microgravity itself does not prevent plant growth and reproduction. In fact, the use of newly implemented research facilities on the ISS led to impressive progress in plant biology research in space over the last two decades [13,23]. However, the number of pending unresolved questions is enormous and the difficulties and constraints of spaceflight research still represent major obstacles. The first European experiment on plant biology, carried out on the ISS in 2003, was the ROOT experiment, included in the experimental program of the “Cervantes” Mission (Spanish Soyuz Mission) with the objective of investigating alterations induced by the space environment on cellular features of the root meristem. This experiment was performed using autonomous hardware based on the former Biorack containers [24,25], still seriously constrained regarding the environmental control of plant growth parameters [26]. Subsequently, a key step in this research on the ISS was the installation of the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS), a facility specifically dedicated to the growth of seedlings and small plants equipped with advanced environmental controls for plant growth, as well as centrifuges for setting specific gravity conditions [27]. The first experiment carried out in the EMCS was the TROPI project, in 2006, aiming to study the interacting effects of gravity and other stimuli, such as light, on plant growth, to gain insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tropisms and to better understand the interaction between gravitropism and phototropism [28]. Since then, the influence of gravity on early plant development and growth, as well as gravity perception thresholds for species such as lentils and Arabidopsis, and, more recently, the changes in the patterns of gene expression induced by the microgravity environment, have been studied on the ISS using the ESA’s EMCS and KUBIK incubators [29,30], NASA’s BRIC—Biological Research in Canisters [31], ABRS—Advanced Biological Research System [32] and APEX—Advanced Plant Experiment [33], and the JAXA’s PEU—Plant Experimental Unit [34]. All these studies have demonstrated serious alterations in the physiology and development of seedlings and young plants grown in space. The results of the ROOT experiment revealed that one of the most relevant effects of altered gravity is the disruption of the meristematic competence in cells of the root apical meristem [26,35]. This observation means that, under microgravity conditions, cell proliferation and cell growth appear uncoupled, losing their coordinated progress, which is characteristic of these cells under normal ground gravity conditions [36]. The cell proliferation rate is increased and cell growth, estimated by the rate of production of ribosomes, the cellular factories of protein biosynthesis, is depleted. Further complementary experiments performed on ground-based facilities for microgravity simulation, including sequential sampling at different growth times and the analysis of expression of some key genes of cell cycle regulation, have confirmed the uncoupling of cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis caused by altered gravity, showing that microgravity induces serious alterations in the root meristem. This tissue plays a central role in establishing developmental patterns of the plant; therefore, the alterations induced by microgravity represent a serious compromise for plant development and, maybe, even for plant viability. Interestingly, the effects of gravitational stress are detected from the very beginning of germination, in two-day-old seedlings [37,38]. The observations and interpretations made on root meristems from seedlings have been confirmed and demonstrated in studies performed on cells cultured in vitro and grown in simulated microgravity. Flow cytometry analysis provided evidence for an accelerated cell cycle in cells grown in the random positioning machine (RPM). The final acceleration was the result of a shorter G2 phase and a slightly longer G1 phase. Analysis of gene expression showed a general downregulation of genes involved in the G2/M transition checkpoint and the upregulation of many genes controlling the G1/S transition. This is accompanied by the downregulation of significant genes regulating ribosome biogenesis and by the depletion of levels of nucleolin and fibrillarin, two nucleolar proteins considered markers of this process. In addition, a general depletion of the nuclear transcription was detected, accompanied by an increase in chromatin condensation, which was associated with changes in enzymes involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression [39,40,41]. According to data from many studies, the factor triggering the cascade of functional events that eventually resulted in the alteration of meristematic cell proliferation and growth and in the disruption of meristematic competence is the phytohormone auxin [42]. This hormone is a chief controller of the balance between cell proliferation and cell differentiation existing in meristems, which is the basis of the fundamental involvement of the meristematic tissue in plant development [43]. Moreover, auxin influences multiple aspects of plant growth and development, including the regulation of cell cycle progression and the coordination between cell growth and cell division [44]. From a more general perspective, auxin regulates the connection between stimuli perceived by the plant and the cellular responses to them [45]. The TROPI-1 experiment, the first experiment carried out in the EMCS, produced high-quality video downlinks of growing seedlings. It was shown that emissions with blue light might give an increased phototropic response in the hypocotyls. In addition, a novel positive phototropic response was observed after exposure to red light in hypocotyls and roots developed in microgravity [46]. In a complementary experiment with shared objectives, called TROPI-2, the positive phototropic curvature in hypocotyls and roots mediated by phytochrome, observed as a response to red light, was confirmed. At gravitational accelerations ranging from 0.1 g to 0.3 g, an attenuation of red-light-based phototropism of both roots and hypocotyls was observed [47]. Furthermore, from the frozen TROPI-2 samples returned, high-quality RNA was isolated and transcriptomic analysis was performed. Differences in expression between spaceflight samples and ground controls mostly affected genes involved in regulating cell polarity, cell wall development, oxygen status, and cell defense or stress. These differences represent the adaptive mechanisms of plants to the spaceflight environment [48]. The transcriptomic study carried out in the TROPI-2 project was part of a considerable effort made by different research groups directed to determine the effects of spaceflight on the plant genome, especially how microgravity conditions change gene and protein expression, using advanced -omics methodologies. Various experimental approaches have been assayed. Transcriptomic studies have used seedlings, plant organs, whole plants, and cultured cells of different types (established lines and callus cultures) exposed to real microgravity (spaceflight) or to simulated microgravity in ground-based facilities (see, for example, [33,49,50,51,52,53]). Collectively, these and other studies have demonstrated the complex responses in plants, involving reprogramming of the gene expression patterns. To date, specific genes of responses to gravity alterations have not been found; instead, genes known to participate in general mechanisms of the response to abiotic stresses have been shown to modify their expression in the microgravity environment. Genes coding for heat-shock-related elements, cell wall remodeling factors, oxidative burst intermediates, and components of the general mechanisms of plant defense are the main and most frequent targets of gene reprogramming induced by microgravity.3. However, Plants May Overcome Gravitational Stress and Adapt to the Space Environment All the aforementioned research has focused on studies of the alterations of biological mechanisms in plants induced by the space environment. Using molecular, cellular, and physiological methods, this has led to the conclusion that the space environment is deleterious for normal plant life, such as it is known on Earth. However, together with this fundamental research, mainly using model plant species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, an alternative approach has consisted of the direct in situ production of vegetable crops on the ISS, and their eventual use as fresh food to supplement the packaged diet of astronauts. This has been (and still it is) a specific objective of NASA. Obviously, food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions (e.g., reduced gravity and elevated radiation levels) compared with plants grown on Earth, which have been revealed as potentially harmful to plant life. However, the first result of this novel approach was that red romaine lettuce was successfully grown in three tests in the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) facility with two different harvest methods, and yields were comparable to growth on Earth. The production and tasting of the first “space salad” and, shortly after, the development of a Zinnia flower, received much attention from mass media all over the world, and the first nutritional analysis of space-grown plants has recently been published [54], showing that lettuces grown on the ISS are nutritionally and microbiologically safe for humans. In addition to Veggie, NASA has recently implemented the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) on the ISS, a more sophisticated facility with similar purposes, and complemented the Veggie facility with the Exposed Roots On-Orbit Test System (X-ROOTS). The general purpose of this effort is to perform compatible plant-related scientific research on ISS, using molecular, cellular, and physiological methods, with the direct production of fresh and nutritious food in bioregenerative life support systems (BLSSs). The final objective is that reduced plant growth in space can be directly translated into larger planting areas. In addition to applications for the production of food for space explorers, these experiments enable the drawing of relevant conclusions related to the physiology of plants in microgravity. Lettuce and other crops cultured in Veggie and APH are indeed adult plants; therefore, despite the stresses on plant growth and development caused by the space environment, and specifically, by microgravity, plants are capable of overcoming adverse circumstances, removing the obstacles, and achieving successful development until the adult stage, including reproduction. These results complement experiments specifically addressed to complete the full life cycle of plants (seed-to-seed) in space, carried out with A. thaliana. Using advanced growth chambers which, in general, provide a well-regulated environment for growing plants in microgravity on the ISS, fertile adult plants have been produced from seeds germinated in space; seeds obtained from these plants have, in turn, been germinated. The ADVANCED ASTROCULTURE (ADVASC) experiment, consisting of two successive experiments, was carried out in 2001–2002, in which the plant life cycle was completed [55]. A second experiment was the Japanese SPACE SEED, carried out in the Kibo module of the ISS in 2009 [34]. It is therefore clear that plants are capable of acclimating/adapting to the space environment. However, we currently lack knowledge of the mechanisms (cellular or molecular) by which the adaptation takes place and eventually succeeds. Currently, a key challenge for plant space research is to determine how and when the plant triggers mechanisms of adaptation in order to attenuate, or even overcome, the survival problems associated with a weightless environment.4. Plant Culture in Space May Benefit from Other Environmental Cues Replacing Gravity The optimization of plant growth in the microgravity environment of spaceflight, as well as in any other condition of reduced gravity, could become feasible by implementing the substitution of gravity by another external cue, which could play the same or a similar role in driving plant growth and development as gravity does on Earth. Light is a good candidate to be one of these cues because it is a tropistic stimulus. Phototropism complements gravitropism under normal ground conditions, with the objective of optimizing the efficiency of the capture of nutrients. In addition, illumination, especially by red light, is sensed and mediated by phytochromes to produce changes in the regulation of auxin-responsive genes and many growth coordinators [56]. A specific effect of red light in the activation of specific cellular processes known to be depleted in the microgravity environment, such as cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis, had previously been reported [57]. Furthermore, light is known to induce the reorganization of chromatin architecture, as well as a global amplification of nuclear transcription [58]. These effects could potentially reverse the epigenetic de-activation that was found to be an effect of the simulated microgravity in cultured cells, as mentioned above. Interestingly, the enhancement of light signaling to compensate for the absence of gravity was found to be a spontaneous response of plants to the lack of gravitropic stimuli in spaceflight, as shown by the upregulation of genes associated with plastid functioning, some of them closely related to photosynthesis [52]. This genetic response took place even in etiolated seedlings, in the absence of an effective light signal. The culture of seedlings in simulated microgravity under a photoperiod regime was capable of reverting many of the alterations found on etiolated seedlings incubated in the same facility for microgravity simulation [59]. Actually, light induces variable tropism in the aerial part of the plant (shoot and leaves; hypocotyl in seedlings) and in roots. Recent experiments have shown that seedling orientation in simulated microgravity can be improved by illuminating hypocotyls while keeping roots in darkness, by the action of a “light avoidance” mechanism that operates in roots [60]. This behavior, which mimics the natural situation of growing plants in soil, can be used advantageously to improve plant culture in space.5. The Advantages of Red Light Illumination to Improve Seedling Viability in Space, as Revealed by the SEEDLING GROWTH Experiments The series of three experiments, termed the SEEDLING GROWTH (SG) Project, was conducted on the ISS (2013–2017) with the aim of ascertaining the link between light and gravity, and of determining the combined influence of light and gravity on plant development, at reduced gravity levels. Among other objectives, the project investigated to what extent light could act as a signal capable of counteracting the deleterious effects caused by the lack of gravity. Specifically, we aimed to explore if, and to what extent, specific light conditions could be applied to modulate the alterations caused by the lack of gravity on plant growth and development, thus facilitating the adaptation of plants to the space environment. The project consisted of three phases, termed SG1, SG2, and SG3, each performed in different spaceflights to the ISS, or ISS increments, between 2013 and 2017. The last experiment was the Ground Reference Control, carried out in 2018. This project was the result of the cooperation of NASA and ESA, using a European incubator (European Modular Cultivation System, EMCS) [27] equipped with two centrifuges, enabling control of the gravity level. The use of this spaceflight incubator was combined with culture chambers for the incubation of seeds and the growth of seedlings developed by NASA, and termed “TROPI cassettes” [28], and with a novel device, called FixBox, specifically designed and built in Europe for the chemical fixation of samples within cassettes to allow their microscopical examination postflight [61]. Different collections of mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, affecting phytochromes, nucleolar proteins, and auxin-responsive genes were used, as well as the DII-Venus reporter line for the visualization of auxin localization [62]. Depending on the specific mutants, the corresponding wild-type ecotypes were Landsberg erecta (Ler), for the phytochrome mutants, and Columbia (Col-0) for all the other mutants and lines. Seeds germinated in-flight and grew for six days under different regimens of illumination and gravity. In addition to microgravity existing in space, seedlings were subjected to different levels of gravity between microgravity and 1 g, including Moon and Mars gravity levels, achieved with the on-board EMCS centrifuges. In the SG1 and SG2 experiments, phytochrome mutants (phyA and phyB) and Ler wild-type seeds were germinated after hydration. Seedlings were initially grown at 1 g under white light for 96 h with the purpose of establishing a robust growth axis, followed by unidirectional (lateral) photostimulation for 48 h with red light, blue light, or red followed by blue light, under six gravity conditions: microgravity, 0.1 g, 0.3 g, 0.5 g, 0.8 g, and 1.0 g. Videorecording during the photostimulation phase enabled the identification of new phototropic responses to blue light in space, which complement findings obtained in previous TROPI I and II experiments [63]. Blue light is a known source of phototropic stimulus on Earth [64]. In plants grown in space under phototropic stimulation with blue light and under different gravity levels, which were preserved by ultra-freezing (−80 °C) and returned to Earth, a global transcriptomic study provided a very clear differential transcriptional response to each gravity level, from microgravity to 1 g. In the case of the microgravity-exposed plants, functions associated with light sensing and response, such as photosynthesis and related factors, appeared to be downregulated with respect to 1 g controls, suggesting that the growth was not following the phototropic environmental cue in the absence of the gravitropic cue. This observation would mean that gravity responses influence plant development under exposure to directional blue light. [65]. A similar analysis performed under the different levels of gravity mentioned above, including those corresponding to the Moon and Mars, showed that the effects induced by microgravity, especially those affecting plastid-related genes, were gradually removed by increasing the g-load, and that different functions appeared to be affected at different g-levels. However, a strong general abiotic stress response was detected at levels lower than the Moon gravity (lower than 0.1 g), probably due to the confluence of different altered stimuli at the detection threshold of photo- and gravi-sensing mechanisms, which could cause conflicting responses. At higher g-levels, the alteration became progressively weaker [66]. In general, blue light phototropism was found to be capable of reducing the gravitational stress response in spaceflight. The effect of red light on Ler wild-type samples grown with the same protocol described above was investigated in roots by selecting marker genes for cell growth and proliferation and analyzing their differential expression under different conditions of gravity and light using qPCR. The results showed a positive effect of photoactivation with this wavelength in counteracting the stress caused by spaceflight in the root meristem, which had previously been identified and described. In these conditions, marker genes for cell proliferation, cell growth, and auxin polar transport showed a concerted upregulation [67]. Therefore, unilateral illumination with red light during the last two days of culture in microgravity on the ISS, after four days of growth under white light at 1 g, was capable of reverting, totally or partially, the alterations caused by microgravity on the root meristem. This included re-establishing meristematic competence and auxin transport. A parallel study on the ground using simulated microgravity (RPM) confirmed the spaceflight data [67]. In additional experiments of the series (SG2 and SG3), Col-0 seedlings and mutants were grown for 4 days under illumination with a photoperiod (16 h white light/8 h dark) and were then photostimulated with directional red light for two days. Control samples were kept in darkness for this period. Seedlings grew either in microgravity, at 0.3 g (a gravity level near that of Mars which was obtained with the centrifuge installed in the EMCS), and at 1 g (flight control), also produced by the rotating centrifuge. The effects of light and gravity on the growth of seedlings were noted on images taken after the 4-day period of growth and after the 6th day, including red light photostimulation (Figure 1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Images of Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (Col-0) seedlings grown on the ISS in the Seedling Growth-3 (SG3) experiment. Seeds were affixed to a black gridded membrane (the distance between the grid lines on the membrane was 3 mm) and hydrated to promote germination. Upper row: seedlings grown for 4 days under a white light photoperiod (16 h/8 h). The light source was positioned in the upper part of the images. Different levels of gravity were applied using the centrifuges installed in the EMCS facility, namely, microgravity (micro-g), near-Mars gravity (0.3 g), and Earth gravity (1 g). Notably, in all cases, white light was capable of determining the orientation of hypocotyls; however, the orientation of roots depended on the level of gravity. Lower row: seedlings grown for two additional days under continuous unilateral illumination with red light. The light source was positioned at the left side of the images. Red light was not capable, per se, of inducing orientation of seedlings, as shown in the microgravity image; only a few seedlings appeared to orient their root tips towards the light source. However, partial gravity, as well as Earth gravity levels, were sufficient to produce the seedling orientation according to the gravity vector.Regarding wild-type seedlings, illumination in the photoperiod showed a differential effect on hypocotyls and roots. Under microgravity, hypocotyls appeared generally oriented towards the light source, showing little differences with the orientation exhibited by control seedlings grown at 1 g. In contrast, light did not appear to influence the orientation of roots in microgravity, which showed considerable differences with the oriented roots of seedlings grown at 1 g (Figure 1). These features are in agreement with the results of experiments performed in simulated microgravity [59]. Photoactivation with directional red light suppressed the orientation of hypocotyls achieved under white light. In general, seedlings appeared randomly oriented, although the effect was stronger in seedlings located closer to the red light source, whereas seedlings placed further from light preserved some orientation (Figure 1). Red light phototropism, described in the roots of seedlings grown in microgravity [46], was weak; thus, it was difficult to observe when the starting point was disoriented roots. Nevertheless, signs of this root tropism could be detected in some seedlings (Figure 1). The images of seedlings grown at 0.3 g were especially significant, because they showed seedlings almost totally oriented in their hypocotyls and roots according to the partial gravity vector. This orientation, very similar to the result of growth at 1 g, was not suppressed by red light, indicating that it was a clear effect of this level of gravity (Figure 1). Thus, the gravity vector existing at the surface of Mars is capable, per se, of inducing a positive gravitropism in the roots of A. thaliana. This finding could be relevant to realizing the culture of plants on the Red Planet. A full-genome global transcriptomic analysis of red-light-photostimulated plants versus plants grown in darkness was performed on samples grown in the SG2 spaceflight experiment. A specific purpose of this analysis was to find answers to two relevant questions: (a) Is red light irradiation capable of reverting the pattern of gene expression under microgravity to a pattern closer to that of control 1 g conditions?; and (b) Is red light irradiation capable of counteracting gravitational stress? Transcriptomic data were analyzed using a bioinformatics tool called Gene Expression Dynamic Inspector (GEDI v2.1) [68]. The GEDI profile enabled visualization of the gene expression across the transcriptome, generating a mosaic image or dot matrix, using a self-organizing map algorithm [68]. GEDI creates clusters of genes that share dynamic expression patterns, irrespective of gene ontology or cellular function. The output of GEDI is a characteristic mosaic or GEDI Map, a color-coded two-dimensional grid image (20 × 16 pixels) for each sample (Figure 2a). Each tile in the mosaic (each pixel) represents a cluster of genes that share a similar transcriptional profile in any experimental condition. The color of each tile indicates the relative expression of the genes in that cluster. Finally, clusters of similarly expressing genes are placed in the same neighborhood on the grid, creating an image that enables global transcriptome analysis as a single entity for display in different conditions. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Analysis of the transcriptomic data obtained from samples grown in the Seedling Growth-2 (SG2) experiment on the ISS. Seedlings were grown for 4 days under a white light photoperiod (16 h/8 h), and were then either photoactivated with continuous unidirectional red light for an additional 2 days, or kept in darkness. (a) Global transcriptomic patterns obtained with the bioinformatic tool called Gene Expression Dynamic Inspector (GEDI) of Col-0 wild-type samples grown under different conditions. Genes showing similar degrees of expression were treated together, attributed a color code, and are presented as a tile or pixel in the diagram. Upper row: full genome. Lower row: differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in microgravity, with respect to 1 g. The pattern significantly changed from red-light-1 g conditions to dark-micro-g conditions, but it was reverted in micro-g with red light photoactivation. Reversion was higher for the full genome than for DEGs only. (b) Comparison of the transcriptomic effects of a change in illumination, at constant micro-g (left), and of a change in g at constant red light (right). Diagrams show the percentages of upregulated and downregulated genes in the different ontology groups. (c): GEDI maps, under different conditions of light and gravity, of the comparison in gene expression of the Col-0 wild-type and the nuc2 mutant, defective in a gene participating in the stress response mechanisms. Differences in gene expression between the two genotypes in each condition were used to estimate the stress of this condition.Global patterns of the gene expression of seedlings grown for six days in the different conditions of the SG2 experiment, represented as GEDI maps, allowed the comparison of the effects of gravity and red light photoactivation (Figure 2a). The upper row shows the patterns obtained for the full genome (22,719 genes analyzed). The pattern of seedlings grown at 1 g under red light photoactivation was significantly changed in seedlings grown in microgravity and not photoactivated. Interestingly, the pattern was reversed under microgravity when samples were photoactivated, indicating a possible effect of red light in compensation of the alterations induced by microgravity (Figure 2a). Unfortunately, the samples in darkness and at 1g were lost during processing on the ISS and could not be incorporated in the analysis. If the same comparison was restricted to the set of genes showing differential expression in microgravity versus ground gravity (12,950 genes), differences in the pattern were increased and the reversion induced by red light in microgravity was only partial (Figure 2a). Transcriptomic data were subjected to gene ontology (GO) analysis in order to identify the functions especially altered by the different conditions and to differentiate downregulated and upregulated genes (Figure 2b). The results of this analysis were compared, first under constant microgravity, between red light photoactivation and darkness, and then under constant red light photoactivation, between microgravity and ground gravity. Differences in gene expression, caused by either up- or downregulation, in the different ontology groups were much greater in the first case than in the second case (Figure 2b). The interpretation was that red light photoactivation attenuated the differences in gene expression induced by microgravity. Under constant microgravity, there was a profound difference in gene expression between photoactivated and non-photoactivated samples, but red light illumination significantly mitigated the differences caused by the gravity change (Figure 2b). In these studies, we also used mutants of the nucleolar protein nucleolin, a multifunctional protein that plays key roles in the regulation of the fundamental cellular process of ribosome biogenesis, at multiple steps [69]. The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes two genes for nucleolin, called NUC1 and NUC2. From these two nucleolin genes, one of them, NUC2, is known to participate in the mechanisms of adaptive responses to different stresses [70]. We took advantage of this feature to evaluate the role of red light photoactivation in the attenuation or mitigation of stress caused by microgravity on seedlings. For this purpose, we analyzed differences in the patterns of gene expression, expressed as GEDI maps, between the Col-0 wild type and the nuc2 mutant, under different conditions of gravity and light in spaceflight. The differences in response between the two genotypes should be attributed to the role played by the Nuc2 protein in the stress response, because normal expression of the NUC1 gene should be sufficient to ensure normal regulation of ribosome biogenesis. Under 1 g ground gravity and red light photoactivation, the GEDI map revealed very minor differences in gene expression between the two compared genotypes (Figure 2c). These conditions were not identified as stressful; therefore, there was no need for triggering the mechanisms of stress response mediated by the Nuc2 protein. For this reason, the presence or absence of the NUC2 gene was irrelevant for the global pattern of gene expression. In contrast, microgravity and no photoactivation by red light were identified as stress-generating conditions in cells, capable of triggering the mechanisms of stress response in which the Nuc2 protein is involved. Consequently, the presence or absence of the NUC2 gene greatly affected this response. The result was a significant difference in the global pattern of gene expression, revealed by the GEDI map, between the Col-0 wild type, in which the NUC2 gene is expressed, and the nuc2 mutant, which does not express this gene (Figure 2c). These differences in gene expression were considerably attenuated under microgravity and red light photoactivation in spaceflight, although the GEDI map of the comparison was not totally reversed to the pattern indicative of a full absence of stress (Figure 2c). The conclusion was that red light photoactivation could significantly contribute to realizing the adaptation of plants to the microgravity environment; therefore, it could be used to improve the culture of plants in space. These results were confirmed and extended by a complementary analysis of the nucleolin mutants nuc1 and nuc2, together with the Col-0 wild type, which was performed using samples grown in the SG3 experiment. In parallel, the response of these genotypes to red light photoactivation was investigated under 1 g ground gravity [71]. The basis of these studies was the finding that plant nucleolin gene expression is upregulated by red light on Earth [57]. A global transcriptomic study performed on the ground using WT and both nuc1 and nuc2 mutant lines, comparing conditions of red light photoactivation for two days versus darkness, revealed that illumination at this wavelength enhanced the capability of the NUC2 gene to replace the functions of NUC1 in ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle, when this gene was knocked out in the nuc1 mutant. In addition, in the nuc2 mutant, photoactivation induced an increase in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) belonging to functional groups associated with stress responses. This means that the NUC2 gene may counteract the environmental stress produced by darkness in nuc1 seedlings, although nuc2 seedlings cannot develop a full response to red light [71]. Furthermore, the analysis of these samples grown in spaceflight (SG3) comprised, first, a phenotypic analysis including morphometric parameters of seedlings during development in space in combination with microscopical studies of the root meristems on samples fixed in orbit [61]. Study at the cellular level of the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis in root meristematic cells resulted in values closer to the 1 g control in samples stimulated with red light. Then, gene expression alterations were evaluated by RNAseq. The nuc2 mutant showed differential requirements in response to red light photoactivation and exhibited normal development in space by changing the expression of a smaller number of genes than the wild type, i.e., with reduced requirements in the number of DEGs, which could mean a better capacity than the wild type for adaptation to a microgravity environment. Therefore, a mutant line with this attenuated response may constitute an advantage to be taken into account when selecting the most productive plant varieties for life support systems, and opens the way to directed-mutagenesis strategies in crop design to be used in space colonization scenarios (Manzano et al., 2022, submitted for publication). In addition, the localization of nuclear proteins and auxin distribution were analyzed by confocal and electron microscopy, in studies that were also performed on SG3 samples fixed in space on the ISS. Confocal microscopic images of the root tips of seedlings of the DII-Venus reporter line of A. thaliana showed an altered pattern of auxin distribution in seedlings grown in microgravity with respect to the 1 g control, indicative of some inhibition of the auxin polar transport. This finding confirmed previous experiments on simulated microgravity [72]. In contrast, the pattern of roots grown at 0.3 g was basically similar to the control pattern, indicating that auxin polar transport was not altered at these partial-g levels [73]. This is in agreement with the images of seedlings grown for six days on the ISS under this level of gravity (near-Mars g), showing that roots and hypocotyls appeared to be oriented following the direction of the gravity vector (Figure 1) and, consequently, that normal gravitropism was operating at these levels of gravity. Samples of the Col-0 wild-type ecotype, grown in the SG3 experiment, were also analyzed by confocal and electron microscopy, together with transcriptomic analysis, to obtain additional data on the response of seedlings to microgravity and Mars gravity levels and on the effects of red light photostimulation at these two gravity levels, compared with 1 g ground gravity [74]. The cellular analysis was focused on root meristematic cells. Red light increased meristem and nucleolar size, as observed in the confocal microscopy images. In addition, ultrastructural analysis of meristematic cell nucleoli showed more active nucleoli in the red-light-photostimulated seedlings, as shown by the relative distribution of the nucleolar subcomponents, according to previously described models of the nucleolar structure in relation to activity [75,76]. This observation suggests that red light indeed counteracts the decoupling between cell proliferation and growth, as reported in the aforementioned prior experiments in space and simulated microgravity [35,37]. The transcriptomic RNA-seq analysis, globally considered, showed, as expected, that microgravity has a considerable impact on the transcriptome in A. thaliana seedlings. However, interestingly, partial gravity influences the transcriptome differently from microgravity. Red light photostimulation modulates the response to microgravity and also to partial gravity, producing a clear attenuation of the functional changes induced by altered gravity. Specifically, the transcriptomic analysis of phytohormone signaling indicated an activation of proliferation-promoting pathways in microgravity, such as cytokinin and auxin [74]. Cytokinin alterations in spaceflight were reported previously [77], and the changes in auxin polar transport in the different conditions of light and gravity, as detected in situ with the reporter line DII-Venus, are discussed above. An important result of this analysis was observation of the downregulation of photosynthetic functions in red-light-photostimulated seedlings in microgravity, but not at the Mars gravity level [74]. This result was also obtained from seedlings grown in microgravity and photostimulated with blue light in the course of the SG1 experiment [65]. In both cases, the GO analysis exhibited downregulation in PSI and PSII, the photosynthetic electron transport chain, and chlorophyll metabolism. In addition, overexpression of the plastid and the mitochondrial genome was observed in microgravity. Overexpression of the plastid genes had previously been interpreted as an attempt by the seedlings to enhance light signaling to compensate for the lack of gravity in dark-grown seedlings [52]. However, this overexpression was recorded at different light conditions, and it was indeed more pronounced in red-light-photostimulated seedlings than in seedlings that were kept in the dark. This observation indicated that this effect was not exclusive for etiolated seedlings [74]. The downregulation of photosynthesis functions in seedlings with red or blue light photostimulation could, in fact, be a result of altered plastid function due to alterations in nuclear–organelle communication. These alterations in nuclear–organelle communication could account for the elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression, which was only observed in microgravity conditions, both in darkness and under red light photoactivation. There are two types of nucleus–organelle communication, namely, anterograde (nucleus-to-organelle signaling) and retrograde (organelle-to-nucleus signaling). The dysregulation could take place in either of them: anterograde if the nucleus response does not reach the organelles; retrograde if the nucleus does not perceive the upregulation of plastid and mitochondrial genome expression [78]. However, the Mars gravity level corrected these effects and promoted an adaptive response, with the upregulation of genes of hormone pathways associated with the stress response (abscisic acid, ethylene, and salicylic acid). Furthermore, the upregulation of environmental-acclimation-related transcription factors (WRKY and NACs families) [79,80] was also observed, especially in samples photostimulated with red light, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial gravity levels are able to acclimate by modulating genome expression in routes activated to cope with space-environment-associated stress [74]. Strikingly, samples grown at near-Mars g (0.3 g) showed significant alterations in gene expression, more than expected in view of the data obtained in the SG1 experiment, as noted above [65,66]. There are differences between the two sets of samples (SG1 and SG3), which could be due to the different results, namely, ecotype, light conditions, and time of exposure to altered gravity, among others. Despite the differences, the Mars gravity level was found to cause a more adaptive response than microgravity on SG3 samples. In addition, the upregulation of WRKY transcription factors at the Mars gravity level showed that adaptive mechanisms were activated [74]. Collectively considered, the results showed a differential response to each gravity level, triggering different adaptive responses, involving changes in the regulation of different sets of genes. These changes in gene expression were more reduced under Mars gravity than under microgravity conditions. In all cases, the adaptive response appeared to be enhanced by red light photostimulation.6. Conclusions and Future Prospects The SG series of experiments has constituted a significant contribution to furthering the knowledge of alterations induced by the space environment, specifically by microgravity and different levels of partial gravity, on the physiology of plants. Investigations have focused on the earliest stages of plant development, and a variety of cellular and molecular (transcriptomic) parameters have been studied. Among the key findings of our spaceflight project are the new results on phototropism induced by red and blue light illumination, the effect of red light illumination in counteracting the adverse effects of altered gravity, and the discovery that Moon gravity could trigger more severe transcriptomic responses than spaceflight. However, we also observed that Mars gravity is capable of inducing the gravitropic orientation of roots, and the different responses to the space environment of the various mutants used, suggesting that the selection of plants for their culture in alien environments should require prior detailed analysis of their genotypes in order to select the varieties capable of adapting better. The SG experiments have been among the first in performing a comparative analysis, using microgravity, different levels of partial gravity (including Moon and Mars gravity), and an on-board 1 g control in flight. This has been possible due to the use of the EMCS incubator, equipped with centrifuges providing this capacity. Unfortunately, the EMCS was decommissioned in 2018 and not replaced by any other spaceflight facility with these exact capabilities. The novel advanced NASA incubators for plant culture, Veggie, APH, and X-ROOTS, do not allow for these comparative studies at different gravity levels, which are of the highest importance. In the immediate future, in our next studies, we should incorporate other space environmental factor that, along with gravity, is key to the survival of living beings and particularly of plants: radiation. Fortunately, there are experiments under development in different laboratories, including ours, and different devices and facilities providing the simultaneous application of radiation and different levels of simulated microgravity and partial gravity for experimental analyses. In addition, we need to extend the cellular and molecular studies on plant adaptation to the space environment, such as SG, to the use of crop species. NASA is actively promoting plant studies on the ISS using the aforementioned spaceflight incubators Veggie, APH, and X-ROOTS, but this activity is basically oriented to nutritional aspects, without giving the necessary priority to fundamental studies at cellular and molecular level. Surprisingly, the activity of ESA in plant biology studies has been relatively slow after completion of the SG project. Obviously, the decommission of EMCS, an ESA facility, has been an important factor, but not the only one. There is an ongoing project to adapt the Biolab, a seriously underused spaceflight facility, to plant experiments of this type. It is vital that Europe regains the initiative in this research area as soon as possible, and thus again being able to play a relevant role in meeting the need for an effective culture of plants in space. Nowadays, this need, as a key human life support mechanism in space exploration, is becoming more and more urgent.Acknowledgments We would like to express our gratitude to astronauts, technicians, engineers, and management personnel who participated in our spaceflight and ground-based experiments.Author Contributions F.-J.M. wrote the first draft of the manuscript, which was edited by A.M., R.H. and J.Z.K.

Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOSμ translocation from the sarcolemma and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as an early event during mechanical unloading. Thus, redox signaling may serve as a biological switch for nNOS to initiate morphological changes in skeletal muscle fibers. Keywords: atrophy, disuse, skeletal muscle, nNOS, oxidative stress, FoxO3a skeletal muscle is a highly specialized and adaptable mesodermic tissue capable of rapid remodeling in response to changes in mechanical loading and stretch (28, 38). Transmittance and detection of loading in skeletal muscle are paramount in regulating differentiation, cell growth, and protein turnover. The ability to sense and relay loading (i.e., mechanotransduction) is, in part, performed by proteins adjacent to and spanning cell membranes (i.e., sarcolemma) in skeletal muscle (47). Mechanical unloading that occurs with limb casting, splinting, bed rest, and spaceflight, elicits a substantial loss of force-generating capacity, linked to a diminishment in muscle fiber cross-sectional area or atrophy (12, 23). The unloading phenotype also includes a shift of a portion of skeletal muscle fibers from slow-twitch to fast-twitch (12). Muscle atrophy that occurs with unloading is coupled to a net loss of contractile proteins, a function of increased protein degradation combined with a decrease in protein synthesis (12, 23). Recent studies emphasize the importance of proteolytic pathways, including ubiquitin proteasome, calpains, autophagy, and caspase-3 in triggering the early stages of atrophy (4, 10, 11, 26, 34, 35, 39). For example, elevation of ubiquitin ligases with unloading is initiated via dephosphorylation of FoxO3a and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (26, 34, 42). Elegant experiments by Suzuki et al. (42) ushered in a new paradigm, whereby disassembly of skeletal muscle in response to mechanical unloading is accelerated by translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm. The mu (μ)-splice variant of nNOS is a key signaling protein located in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) of skeletal muscle (29, 42), anchored through binding of a PDX motif at its NH2 terminus to α and β-syntrophins, and, thus, to dystrophin and dystrobrevin (13, 29). Fourteen days of mechanical unloading of the soleus resulted in movement of nNOSμ to the sarcoplasm, where nNOSμ directly led to dephosphorylation of FoxO3a at Thr-32, and stimulated ubiquitin ligases and atrophy (42). Interestingly, the loss of nNOSμ from the DGC also occurs in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), where it may exacerbate further disruption of the DGC proteins, thus increasing susceptibility to muscle damage and inflammation (19, 43). Furthermore, knockout of the nNOSμ gene has been recently shown to elicit myopathy and a reduction in contractile force (29). In addition, new data from Ito et al. (15) demonstrate that nNOS activation of the NADPH oxidase isoform Nox4 contributes to hypertrophy when skeletal muscle is overloaded. These data suggest in total that nNOSμ may serve as an effector of dynamic changes in mechanical loading, regardless of whether loading is increased or decreased. While the mechanisms underlying translocation of nNOS are unknown, increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent oxidative stress is possible. For example, oxidative stress from NADPH oxidase and possibly mitochondrial sources play a role in damage in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where nNOS that is lost from the sarcolemma contributes directly to pathology (17, 45). Elevated skeletal muscle ROS from mitochondrial sources during mechanical unloading has been reported by Powers and colleagues (27). Recent data suggest that the Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase, a gp91phox containing NADPH oxidase, is important in stretch-induced Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and damage (17, 45). NADPH oxidase is a family of membrane-bound oxidoreductases in nonphagocytic and phagocytic cells that produce superoxide anions (O2·−) in response to mechanical strain, hypoxia, and damage (17). Elevated oxidative stress from mitochondria and possibly Nox2 could result in a loss or translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma (21, 41). Therefore, we hypothesized that translocation of nNOSμ during an early stage of mechanical unloading would be linked to changes in oxidative stress and downstream dephosphorylation of FoxO3a at Thr-32. We further postulated that attenuation of oxidative stress would mitigate translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemmal region and significantly ameliorate two predominant phenotypic changes that begin early in mechanical unloading: 1) muscle fiber atrophy and 2) fiber-type shift from slow to fast. Previous antioxidant supplementation studies using nonspecific scavengers have yielded inconsistent findings in reducing morphological responses to unloading (3, 6, 20). In contrast, transfection of the antioxidant enzyme catalase yielded significant protection against atrophy (9). To test the importance of redox signaling, we used a novel cell-permeable, saline-manganese compound (EUK-134), which mimics the catalytic function of superoxide dismutase (SOD) coupled with catalase. In addition, to target redox signaling that is active early in the unloading process, and, therefore, involvement in initiation of atrophy, we chose a 54-h period of hindlimb unloading when oxidative stress is peaking (4). METHODS Animals. Young adult (4–6 mo) Fischer-344 (F344) rats were used to model disuse via hindlimb unloading. Animals were housed and cared for in accordance with National Institutes of Health policy (; DHEW publication no. 85–23, revised 1985). Procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas A&M University and meet all federal requirements, as defined in the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) and the Public Health Service Policy and the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Rat chow and water were provided ad libitum, and the animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled room (23 ± 2°C) with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Rodents are valuable mammalian models for muscle wasting that occur in human disuse and unloading, with changes in muscle fiber cross-sectional area, weakness, and fiber-type shift from slow to fast, resembling responses in humans.Hindlimb unloading. An adaptation of the rodent hindlimb unloading model (7) was utilized to induce mechanical unloading. Briefly, the hindlimbs of the hindlimb unloading (HU) group were elevated to a spinal orientation of 55° above horizontal. We secured the tail with flexible, orthopedic tape around the middle one-third of the tail. The tail harness was attached to a linear mobile system with the line and adjusted, so that the hindlimb paws were suspended, while the rats were free to ambulate around the cage with their forelimbs for food and water.Experimental design. A hindlimb unloading period was chosen to target the early phase of skeletal muscle remodeling during hindlimb unloading. Markers of atrophy and oxidative stress are first seen in the hindlimb unloading model for limb muscles at 2–3 days (4). We used a cell-permeable, catalytic saline-manganese compound developed by Eukarion (EUK-134) as an intervention for elevated oxidative stress. Adult F344 rats were divided into three groups (n = 8/group): loaded controls (CON), 54 h of hindlimb unloading, and hindlimb unloading + 3 mg·kg−1·day−1 ip of the SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134 (HU-EUK). This dosage used for EUK-134 was similar to that used by Bianca et al. (5). Administration of EUK-134 commenced 24 h prior to hindlimb unloading. The EUK series mimics the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase and, thus, remove superoxide anions (O2·−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). SOD/catalase mimetics have high specificity for O2·−, H2O2, and low toxicity with potential for translational use (32). EUK-134 had no effect on endogenous antioxidant enzyme (e.g., MnSOD and Cu, ZnSOD) protein levels (data not shown).Skeletal muscle preparation. The soleus was chosen as a model of skeletal muscle response to mechanical unloading. As a postural muscle with a high percentage of Type I (slow-twitch) fibers, the soleus is susceptible to rapid atrophy and remodeling when exposed to mechanical unloading (7). Following a dose of pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg), the soleus muscles were carefully dissected, cleaned, rinsed with Krebs-Ringer solution, laid along the longitudinal axis on a polyurethane splint, and then frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen for histological analysis or directly in liquid nitrogen for protein assays. Muscle samples were ground into homogenates with a glass-on-glass pestle at a 26:1 dilution of lysis buffer cooled in melting ice (4°C). The lysis buffer contained 20 mM HEPES free acid, 10 mM HEPES Na salt, 350 mM mannitol, 10% glycerol, 25 mM KCL, and 0.5 mM EDTA. Homogenates were centrifuged 10 min at 3,000 g at 4°C, and supernatant 1 was removed as the soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended (9:1 vol/vol) in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES free acid, 20 mM HEPES Na salt, 350 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM EDTA, and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatant 1 was then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatant 2 from this spin served as the cytosolic fraction and was verified using MnSOD. The remaining pellet was the crude membrane fraction, which was resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES free acid, 20 mM HEPES Na salt, 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM EDTA. Protein content was assessed using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit.Fiber-type analysis and morphology. We adapted a method for fiber-type identification previously described by Kanatous et al. (16). Transverse muscle sections from the soleus of six animals per group were cut (10 μm) in a cryotome at −15°C and then air-dried for 30 min. Sections were placed in acidic (pH = 4.25) or alkaline (pH = 10.4) preincubation medium. The sections were rinsed thrice in 100 mM Tris buffer (pH = 7.8) with 18 mM CaCl2 for 2 min each. Slides were then placed in an ATP incubation solution (pH = 9.4) for 25 min at room temperature, and rinsed 3 times in 1% CaCl2 solution. Sections were counterstained in 0.1% toluidine blue solution for 90 s and then briefly washed in dH2O. Sections were dehydrated in 95% ethanol, twice in 100% ethanol, and then cleared in xylene 2 times (5 min each). Coverslips were then mounted with Vectamount (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Type I fibers stain lightly with alkaline preincubation. Type II fibers have differential lability under acidic conditions where Type IIa stain lightest and Type IIb/d fibers stain medium blue. Delp and Duan (8) previously estimated the fiber-type distribution in Fischer-344 rats as 84% Type I, 7% Type IIa, and 9% Type IId. Muscle cross-sectional areas were measured, recorded, and calibrated against a stage micrometer. Images were captured on a Zeiss Axioplot Vision-series microscope, and quantified using the  ImageJ program. Six soleus muscles per group were analyzed with each fiber cross-sectional area in square micrometer units calculated using ImageJ against the stage micrometer standard. There were ∼400–600 fibers/muscle quantified, with three groups of six samples, for a total of nearly 9,000 fibers analyzed for morphology and fiber type.Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. For histochemical and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays, muscle samples were mounted and embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) medium. Cross sections were cut at a temperature of −15°C in a Shandon Cryotome FSE (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA) and dried for 30 min. For visualization via hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) staining, each section had a brief gentle rinse of dH2O after drying. Briefly, soleus sections were then incubated with alum hematoxylin for 4 min at room temperature and rinsed with tap water to enhance bluing of nuclei. Differentiation was induced to remove background with 75% ethanol and 0.3% glacial acetic acid (acid-alcohol solution) for 15 min in a Coplar jar. Following another brief rinse in tap water, sections were incubated in eosin Y for 4 min at room temperature. Samples were then dehydrated with two changes of 95% ethanol and two short incubations (2 min) in 100% ethanol. Slides were cleared in xylene and sealed under a cover slip in mounting media (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured on an Olympus IX-51 (Olympus Imaging America, Center Valley, PA) inverted epifluorescence microscope. For immunohistochemistry assays, muscle cross sections were cut at −15°C and fixed in acetone for 60 min. Sections were then blocked in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 10% serum from a source matched with the host of the secondary antibody. The appropriate primary antibody for nNOS (1:50 dilution; Cayman 160870), gp91phox (1:100; SC-5827; specific for Nox2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and p47phox (1:100; Santa Cruz SC-7660) were applied in blocking buffer and placed on each section for an hour. After washing in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, biotinylated secondary antibody from Vector Laboratories was applied to the sections (1:200 dilution) and incubated in PBS buffer for 30 min. Cross sections were stained for 30 min with Vectastain Elite ABC reagent and incubated in NovaRed peroxidase substrate solution (Vector Laboratories) for 5 min. For nNOS localization, IHCs were also run using a TSA (tyramide signal amplification) kit (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA) to enhance localization of both sarcolemmal and cytosolic locations of nNOS, as recommended by Punkt et al. (31). Within each protein of interest, slides from samples in all three groups were completed during the same day. Images were taken on a Zeiss Axioplot Vision-series microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY). Membrane protein localization for p47phox and gp91phox was quantified using an edge filter macrodeveloped for the  ImageJ software program. Samples in each group were analyzed under identical conditions.Immunofluorescence. Soleus sections were cut 10 μm thick in a cryostat at −15°C and placed onto microscope slides. Sections were dried for 30 min and fixed in methanol (−20°C) for 10 min, then acetone (−20°C) for 10 min. After 20 min of air-drying, samples were washed for 5 min 3 times in PBS. Sections were then blocked in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20, and 10% goat serum for 15 min. After air drying for 10 min, primary antibodies (1:100 dilution) for 4-hydroxynonenal (Calbiochem; no. 393206) and laminin (Sigma; no. L8271) were applied and incubated for 60 min in blocking buffer at 25°C. After three 10-min washes in PBS, sections were incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) with a fluorochrome attached (e.g., goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594) for 30 min at room temperature. Sections are washed thrice in PBS, and air-dried for 20 min. Slides were then mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade medium (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Images were captured on a Zeiss Axioplot Vision series microscope. The antibody used for 4-hydroxynonenal is specific for any protein adducted or attached to 4-HNE, a stable breakdown product of lipid peroxidation. Therefore, visual 4-HNE adducts were used as a marker of damage or alteration of muscle proteins by oxidative stress. 4-HNE and laminin localization staining for all three groups were completed in a single day's run under the same conditions. We also verified sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 subunits (gp91phox, p47phox) using β-sarcoglycan, a membrane protein integrated into the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Membrane protein localization for 4-hydroxynonenol (4-HNE) was quantified using an edge filter macro developed for the  ImageJ software program. Cell membranes were traced using the membrane-binding protein laminin as a standard. Each sample among groups was analyzed using the same procedure. The edge filter width was set at 5 μm.Western immunoblot. Protein abundance was determined by Western immunoblot analysis in the cytosolic and crude membrane fractions. Twenty micrograms of protein were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoresed using a Bio-Rad Protein III gel-box. Briefly, separating gel (375 mM Tris·HCl; pH = 8.8; 0.4% SDS; 10% acrylamide) and stacking gel (125 mM Tris·HCl; pH = 6.8; 0.4% SDS; 10% acrylamide monomer) solutions were made, and polymerization was initiated by TEMED and ammonium persulfate. Separating and stacking gels were quickly poured into a Bio-Rad Protein III gel-box (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Soleus samples in sample buffer (Tris pH = 6.8 with 2% SDS, 30 mM DTT, 25% glycerol) were then loaded into the wells of the gels, and electrophoresed at 150 V. The gels were transferred at 30 V overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 for 6 h and then incubated in the appropriate 1° Ab. Antibodies for nNOS (BD: 610309) and FoxO3a phosphorylation at Thr-32 (Cell Signaling: 9464) (1:1,000) were incubated for 12 h at room temperature. Following three washings in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20, membranes were incubated in a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 90 min. Then an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) was used for visualization. Densitometry and quantification were performed using the  ImageJ software program. The product of blot intensity and area was used to identify abundance. To ensure equal loading of protein, Ponceau-S-staining was performed for each membrane to verify loading, and the lane background reading was subtracted from each protein blot density reading. Membranes were stripped and reprobed for GAPDH or dystrophin when normalizing for abundance vs. a control protein. Both GAPDH and β-actin were tested as loading controls. Neither GAPDH nor β-actin exhibited any mean differences in protein abundance (Fig. 10). Fig. 10. Open in a new tab No significant differences in GAPDH nor β-actin among controls (CON), hindlimb unloaded (HU), and hindlimb unloaded + EUK-134 in the rat soleus muscle.Statistics. A one-way ANOVA was conducted for protein content, mean muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), and fiber-type with Fisher-LSD run post hoc to determine group mean differences. Analyses were verified for normal distribution with variance homogenously distributed among groups. A Chi-square test was used for determining group differences among muscle fiber CSA profiles. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.RESULTS Alterations in soleus muscle morphology with 54 h of mechanical unloading are regulated by oxidative stress. In the first experiment, we tested the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species were a causal factor in the unloading-induced phenotype: reduction of muscle fiber cross-sectional and partial shift of fiber type from slow-to-fast twitch. Previously, nitric oxide synthase inhibition was shown to regulate muscle hypertrophy and fiber-type shift in response to overloading (15, 38). In addition, inhibition or genetic ablation of nNOS substantially reduced proteolysis and muscle fiber atrophy during mechanical unloading (42). nNOSμ may, indeed, be responsible for guiding skeletal muscle remodeling in response to a dynamic change in mechanical loading (42). Body masses (means ± SD) were not statistically different among ambulatory control (435.1 ± 17.6 g), hindlimb unloaded (437.4 ± 22.4g), and hindlimb unloaded + EUK-134 (415.8 ± 22.5 g). While the EUK-134 trended lower, their mass also trended lower prior to the commencement of the study. Soleus-to-body mass ratio trended lower for HU (158.6 ± 11.4 mg/kg) than CON (165.5 ± 15.6 mg/kg) or HU+EUK (163.8 ± 9.27 mg/kg) but did not reach statistical significance. Total protein concentration was significantly lower in HU (1,160 ± 126 μg/g) than CON (1,649 ± 90 μg/g), suggestive of greater water and/or reduced protein levels during the early phase of mechanical unloading. However, HU + EUK total protein content (1,302 ± 175 μg/g) was not significantly lower than that of controls. We quantified muscle CSA and observed that the fiber cross-sectional area profile (Fig. 1A) for the soleus exposed to hindlimb unloading shifted to the left, illustrating a marked reduction in muscle fiber cross-sectional area (Fig. 1B). The greatest number of soleus fibers was found in the 1,800–2,400 μm2 range after unloading, in contrast with the 3,000–3,600 μm2 range in the ambulatory control group. Remarkably, muscle fiber atrophy was virtually completely abolished by EUK-134 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we found that EUK-134 reduced muscle fiber atrophy primarily in Type I fibers (Fig. 1, A and B) but offered no protection in Type IIa and Type IIb/d fibers (Fig. 1, C and D). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Oxidative stress elicits muscle fiber atrophy with mechanical unloading. Fifty-four hours of hindlimb unloading reduced muscle fiber size as displayed by fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) distribution (A) for CON, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and HU-EUK rats (n = 8/group). EUK-134 protected against the left shift in muscle fiber CSA distribution, indicating that oxidative stress was causal in fiber atrophy in the early phase of unloading. Muscle fiber atrophy was apparent in slow-twitch of Type I fibers of the soleus (B) (P < 0.01), but not in Type IIa fibers (C) or Type IIb/d fibers (D) of the soleus. a,bLetters that differ are significantly different from each other (P < 0.05).To determine whether EUK-134 affected muscle mass and fiber cross-sectional area, independent of unloading, we conducted a set of follow-up control experiments. We tested 10 additional rats under loaded, ambulatory conditions, in which rats received three saline or EUK-134 injections over a 78-h period. This strategy covered the 54-h unloading period plus the injection, given 24 h prior to HU. Body weights, soleus mass (Fig. 2A), and the ratio of muscle mass to body mass (Fig. 2B) were not different between the saline and EUK-134 groups. In addition, means for skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area (Fig. 2C) did not significantly differ between saline and EUK-134-injected rats when loaded with normal ambulation. These data are consistent with the notion that EUK-134's effects on skeletal muscle mass were specific to the unloading protocol. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab EUK-134 has no effect on soleus mass or fiber cross-sectional area in ambulatory rats. Seventy-eight hours EUK-134 or saline injection had no differential effect on soleus muscle mass (A), soleus mass/body mass ratio (B), or soleus muscle cross-sectional area (C).We tested the hypothesis that unloading-induced shift of skeletal muscle fiber-type from slow to fast was dependent on oxidative stress. Representative ATPase stains with acid and alkaline preincubation that are labile for Type II and Type I fibers, respectively, are displayed in Fig. 3A. Mechanical unloading caused a significant reduction in the percentage of Type I fibers, as expected (Fig. 3B). In addition, hindlimb unloading also caused an elevation in the percentage of Type IIa- (Fig. 3C) and Type IIb/d (Fig. 3D)-positive fibers. Remarkably, EUK-134 virtually halted the unloading-induced reduction in slow-twitch or Type I fibers within the rat soleus (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistent with the effect on Type I fibers, EUK-134 also prevented elevation of fast-twitch Type IIa (Fig. 3C) and Type IIb/d fibers observed with unloading (Fig. 3D). To our knowledge, these are the first data to indicate that redox signaling plays a significant role in the fiber-type shift that occurs in response to mechanical unloading. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Unloading-induced fiber-type shift is redox regulated in CON, HU, and HU-EUK rats (n = 8/group). A modified ATPase-staining technique revealed that significant shift in muscle soleus muscle fiber-type from fast to slow in the soleus as a result of HU. A: representative sections for both alkaline (pH = 10.4) and acidic (pH = 4.25) preincubations are presented. A reduction of slow-twitch fibers (Type I) was noted with HU (B) (P < 0.05), accompanied by an elevation in Type IIa (C), and Type IIb/d fibers (D). EUK-134 abrogated the unloading-induced fiber-type shift (A–D). a,bLetters that differ are significantly different from each other (P < 0.05).EUK-134 attenuates nNOS translocation with hindlimb unloading. In the next set of experiments, we tested the hypothesis that perturbations in the location of nNOSμ would be reduced by EUK-134. Hematoxylin-and-eosin stains are presented in Fig. 4A. Using immunohistochemistry, we initially observed substantial delocalization of nNOS from the sarcolemma as a result of short-term hindlimb unloading (Fig. 4, B and C). Suzuki et al. (42) had previously reported that nNOS leaves the sarcolemma and is dispersed through the sarcoplasm after 14 days of hindlimb unloading. Figure 4B features IHCs for nNOS without tyramide signaling amplification (TSA), and Fig. 1C with TSA. Utilizing both methods, we found that localization of nNOS at the sarcolemma was dramatically reduced in the soleus by 54 h of hindlimb unloading. However, cytosolic nNOS localization (29) was more readily observed with TSA with the greatest positive staining in the sarcoplasm within the HU + saline group. Remarkably, 3 days of injections with EUK-134 virtually prevented the loss of nNOS-positive staining from the sarcolemmal region in Fischer-344 rats (Fig. 4, B and C). Indeed, there was robust positive staining of nNOS on the soleus muscle fiber periphery in the EUK-treated group, similar to ambulatory control rats injected with saline. Thus, we provide the first evidence that dislocation of nNOSμ may occur in less than 3 days of mechanical unloading in the rat soleus muscle. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab EUK-134 reduces dislocation of nNOSμ from the sarcolemma of the soleus from HU Fischer-344 rats. Hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E)-stained muscle cross sections are visualized in Fig. 4 (left) for control (CON), HU (middle), and HU + EUK-134 (HU-EUK) (n = 6/group; right). Immunolocalization of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the sarcolemma was lost in the rat soleus muscle as a result of HU, an effect abrogated by the catalytic SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134 as visualized without tyramide signaling amplification (TSA) (B) and with TSA (C). Protein immunoblotting for nNOS was analyzed from membrane (D) and cytosolic (E) fractions. nNOS protein abundance per expression of dystrophin decreased with HU and was protected by EUK-134. EUK-134 attenuated HU-induced elevation in the cytosolic fraction. aSignificantly different (P < 0.01) than the CON group. bSignificantly different (P < 0.01) than the HU group. Scale bar = 100 μm.nNOS protein abundance measured via immunoblot paralled our IHC findings. nNOS levels in the membrane fraction levels, when equated for dystrophin, significantly decreased in the hindlimb unloading group when compared with ambulatory controls (Fig. 4, D and E). Treatment with EUK-134 prevented the reduction in membrane nNOS levels observed with HU, consistent with localization results visualized in Fig. 4, B and C. In contrast, nNOS protein abundance in soluble, cytosolic fraction, equated per GAPDH levels, increased significantly in the HU group (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, EUK-134 prevented the unloading-induced increase in cytosolic nNOS protein abundance. Our immunohistological and protein localization data, therefore, clearly demonstrate that nNOSμ is, indeed, translocated away from the sarcolemma within the first 54 h of mechanical unloading. Furthermore, translocation of nNOSμ with mechanical unloading appeared to be redox-signaling dependent.EUK-134 protects against unloading-related reduction in FoxO3a phosphorylation (Thr-32). Important regulators of muscle atrophy with mechanical unloading include FoxO3a via dephosphorylation and NF-κB via phosphorylation of its inhibitor regulator IκB (IκB) (35). Suzuki et al. (42) demonstrated that dephosphorylation and activation of FoxO3a was dependent upon nNOS translocation from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. Given that EUK-134 attenuated nNOS translocation with 54 h of HU, we tested the hypothesis that EUK-134 would also attenuate loss of phosphorylation at Thr-32 for FoxO3a. Levels of FoxO3a phosphorylation (Thr-32) significantly decreased with the short-term unloading protocol (Fig. 5), as expected. EUK-134 treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation levels at Thr-32 for FoxO3a during HU that were significantly greater than the soleus of unloaded rats injected with saline. In addition, FoxO3a phosphorylation was not significantly different in the HU group injected with EUK-134. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Effect of EUK-134 on FoxO3a phosphorylation. Effect of EUK-134 on FoxO3a phosphorylation at Thr-32 in the soleus of rats that were hindlimb-unloaded for 54 h in CON, HU, and HU-EUK rats (n = 6/group). aSignificantly different than the CON group (P < 0.01). bSignificantly different than the HU group (P < 0.05).Unloading-induced elevation of oxidative stress and Nox2 is reduced by EUK-134. To determine whether EUK-134, indeed, ameliorated unloading-induced oxidative stress in the soleus muscle, we tracked 4-HNE-positive imaging. Previously, elevation of oxidative stress in response to mechanical unloading has been reported in both hindlimb unloading and mechanical ventilation models (23, 24, 26). In the current study, we found that 4-HNE protein adducts increased in the soleus following 54 h of hindlimb unloading (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, there was increased localization of 4-HNE around the sarcolemma with short-term unloading, using laminin immunofluorescence in parallel images to confirm localization (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, elevation in soleus 4-HNE fluorescence caused by hindlimb unloading was partially abrogated by EUK-134 treatment (Fig. 6A), confirming the inhibitory effect of EUK-134 on oxidative stress. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab EUK-134 reduces 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the HU soleus. We demonstrated that oxidative stress (A) was increased by hindlimb unloading using 4-hydroxynonenal as a marker. Highest positive staining occurred near the sarcolemma as localized via immunofluorescence with laminin (B) used as a control for identifying muscle cells. Quantification of 4-HNE fluorescence intensity can be found in Fig. 6C. aSignificantly different than the CON group (P < 0.001). bSignificantly different than the HU group (P < 0.01).We also measured NF-κB using an ELISA technique previously outlined (22). However, we saw no effects of HU or EUK-134 (data not shown), suggesting the importance of NF-κB likely increases as unloading duration increases. Given the potential for high oxidative stress in the sarcolemmal microenvironment (14) during mechanical unloading, 4-HNE oxidation, and upregulation of Nox2 noted in DMD (46), we also determined immunolocalization of two Nox2 subunits: gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox. Short-term hindlimb unloading, indeed, elevated immunostaining intensity at the sarcolemma of the p47phox-positive in the soleus of F344 rats (Fig. 7, B and D). The EUK-134 group displayed lower gp91phox-positive sarcolemmal localization, while p47phox sarcolemmal intensity levels in the EUK-134 group were not significantly different than controls (Fig. 7, A–C). Membrane-positive staining for gp91phox was demonstrated using immunofluorescence against β-sarcoglycan as our membrane proteins. gp91phox, β-sarcoglycan, merged images, and negative control are pictured in Fig. 8. We also determined p47phox protein abundance using Western immunoblot analysis (Fig. 9). p47phox levels were significantly upregulated in both HU groups. Combined with our DHE data, this is, to our knowledge, the first evidence that the Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase in skeletal muscle is elevated in the first 3 days of mechanical unloading. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Effect of EUK-134 on Nox2 subunit localization at the sarcolemma in for CON, HU, and HU-EUK groups (n = 6/group). Localization of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits gp91phox (Nox2) (A) and p47phox (B) increased in response to mechanical unloading. The HU-EUK-134 displayed significantly lower (P < 0.05) levels of gp91phox (A, C) than the HU group. p47phox-positive immunostaining (B and D) was significantly greater (P < 0.05) for HU vs. CON, but not for rats treated with EUK-134. Scale bar = 100 μm.Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Immunofluorescence of gp91phox in soleus muscles from control (CON) and hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. β-sarcoglycan is used as a sarcolemmal marker. Merged images are also displayed. Rabbit IgG is used as a negative control for the primary antibody.Fig. 9. Open in a new tab Protein abundance for p47phox, expressed as a ratio relative to GAPDH (top) and β-actin expression (bottom). Representative blots and summary statistics are presented in HU and HU + EUK-134 groups exhibited significantly greater p47phox than controls (CON).Both GAPDH and β-actin were tested as loading controls. Neither GAPDH nor β-actin exhibited any mean differences in protein abundance (Fig. 10).DISCUSSION In this study, EUK-134, a mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, attenuated the mechanical unloading or “spaceflight phenotype” in skeletal muscle in the hindlimb-unloading ground model: muscle fiber atrophy and slow-twitch to fast-twitch fiber-type shift. EUK-134 protection of unloading-induced muscle atrophy was linked to abrogation of nNOS translocation away from the sarcolemma. Furthermore, EUK-134 also prevented dephosphorylation of FoxO3a at Thr-32, previously shown to be regulated by nNOS translocation. EUK-134 reduced oxidative stress and upregulation of Nox2. A discussion of the principle finding follows. EUK-134 attenuation of nNOS translocation and morphological changes. Our data indicate that unloading-induced translocation of nNOSμ away from the sarcolemma is part of an early adaptation to alterations in mechanotransduction during the unloading process. Moreover, given that EUK-134 mitigated unloading-related upregulation of oxidative stress, we propose nNOSμ translocation in response to mechanical unloading in skeletal muscle is a redox-dependent phenomenon. nNOSμ translocation has previously been associated with increased FoxO3a activation and MuRF-1 activation and muscle atrophy during ground hindlimb unloading (42) and during 91 days of spaceflight (33). In contrast, a new publication indicates that nNOS is necessary in triggering an anabolic signaling pathway involving Nox4 and mTOR, which responds to overloading and regulates muscle hypertrophy (15). Furthermore, nitric oxide and NF-κB were also found to be essential for stretch-induced proliferation of myoblasts (40). Indeed, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase has been shown to attenuate muscle remodeling and fiber-type shift in response to altered mechanical loading, whether the magnitude be increased or decreased (15, 38, 42). Therefore, redox signaling may couple with nNOS to regulate remodeling of skeletal muscle morphology in response to dynamic changes in loading. In contrast, nitric oxide appears not to be requisite for basal proliferation of myoblasts and development (1, 39). Intervention with EUK-134 not only mitigated unloading-induced atrophy, but also appeared to arrest a shift away from the slow-twitch phenotype in the rat soleus. This was an unexpected finding, but potentially significant, in understanding regulation of slow- and fast-twitch fibers in response to use and disuse. For example, Smith et al. (38) reported that inhibition of nitric oxide synthase abrogated a fiber-type shift from fast to slow in the plantaris with increased loading as a result of ablation of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, as they are all plantar flexor muscles. Therefore, we postulate that nNOS translocation may contribute to a shift in fiber type from slow to fast. We did note that EUK-134 protection against muscle fiber atrophy was confined to Type I fibers. These findings could be consistent with preferential response of Type I fibers by mechanical unloading or an unloading-induced shift in muscle fiber type from slow-twitch fibers, which are paradoxically larger in the soleus (Fig. 1). It is possible that the time course of the study (54 h) may be too short to elicit morphological alterations in Type II fibers. In addition, the shift from slow- to fast-twitch fibers may seek to preserve cross-sectional area. Thus, additional study is warranted.EUK-134 protection of FoxO3a phosphorylation. EUK-134 ameliorated the reduction in phosphorylation of FoxO3a at Thr-32 caused by hindlimb unloading (Fig. 5), thus reducing a trigger of proteolysis and fiber atrophy (9). Previously, Suzuki et al. (42) demonstrated that translocation of nNOS and cytosolic nitric oxide release by nNOS were required to dephosphorylate FoxO3a in the rat soleus during 14 days of mechanical unloading. FoxO3a activation stimulates upregulation of the ubiquitin ligases MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 (42). Therefore, protection against FoxO3a dephosphorylation at Thr-32 by EUK-134 is consistent with a pathway, whereby oxidative stress participates in translocation of nNOS with mechanical unloading, directly leading to FoxO3a activation, as well as increased proteolysis through ubiquitin ligases (e.g., MuRF-1), leading to fiber atrophy (42).Oxidative stress and mechanical unloading. Our results are consistent with the hypotheses that oxidative stress 1) is elevated early during mechanical unloading in skeletal muscle and 2) contributes significantly to the atrophy as a consequence of unloading. Protective effects of EUK-134 were specific to changes caused during the unloading protocol, as EUK-134 injections had no effect on normally loaded skeletal muscle mass or morphology (Fig. 2). Furthermore, elevated oxidative stress, as detected with 4-hydroxynonenal, was attenuated with EUK-134, which corresponded with sparing of muscle fiber atrophy. Elevation of oxidative stress after 54 h of mechanical unloading of the rat soleus is consistent with previous studies that indicate oxidative stress is elevated during the first few days of mechanical unloading. Localization of 4-HNE adducts near the sarcolemma (Fig. 6) suggests a source nearby (e.g., Nox2, subsarcolemmal mitochondria). Previously, Abrogast et al. (4) reported that oxidative stress was elevated in unloaded skeletal muscle after 1–3 days. Bowman-Birk inhibitor complex (BBIC), which exhibits antiproteasome and antioxidant properties, significantly reduced unloading-induced fiber atrophy and reduction of force-generating capacity (4). In addition, Powers and colleagues (48) also demonstrated that elevation in oxidative stress occurs in just 12–24 h of unloading in the diaphragm muscle during mechanical ventilation. In a series of studies, oxidative stress was found to be causal in stimulating apoptosis and muscle fiber atrophy in the unloaded diaphragm muscle (25, 26, 34, 48). Recently, transfection of catalase in the soleus has been shown to reduce soleus muscle atrophy during leg immobilization, while lowering oxidative stress (9). It should be noted that evidence supportive of a contribution of oxidative stress in eliciting muscle atrophy with unloading has not been consistent across studies. Indeed, while some antioxidant strategies have been successful in reducing skeletal muscle atrophy with mechanical unloading (4, 25, 30), other interventions have not (6, 20). For example, administration of BBIC significantly attenuated muscle atrophy in limb muscles (4), while Trolox was less successful (6). Vitamin E reduced unloading-induced atrophy when preinjected for 21 days (3), while a broad, nonspecific cocktail of antioxidants was ineffective (20). However, more recent, mechanistic studies indicate that ROS play an important role in unloading-induced atrophy. For example, catalase transfection suppressed activation of FoxO3a and NF-κB, while attenuating one-half of the soleus mass loss during 7 days of unloading (9). Inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative stress using SS-31 also significantly ameliorated muscle atrophy in a casting model of mechanical unloading (27). The reasons underlying differential responses to antioxidant strategies have not been resolved, but length of time, localized effects, specificity, and catalytic vs. scavenger approaches could all play a role. It is also possible that antioxidant therapeutics may be more effective in the early phase of mechanical unloading (1–7 days) than in later phases (14+ days). While redox regulation of subsarcolemmal proteins, including nNOS in skeletal muscle remains poorly understood, there is growing acceptance that ROS sources participate in subcellular regulation of microenvironments, including Nox2 signaling in caveolae and lipid rafts (18, 44). We found increased Nox2 subunit localization at the membrane (Fig. 4) and elevated protein abundance of p47phox (Fig. 9); however, we cannot conclude a causal relationship. In addition, it is possible that Nox2 could serve to amplify or augment mitochondrial ROS (27), recently established as a causal factor in disuse-related atrophy.Study limitations. Recent studies have suggested that the cytokine TNF-α may play a significant role in apoptosis and ubiquitin ligase activation in skeletal muscle during mechanical unloading (2). It is possible that EUK-134 might play a protective role in unloading-induced atrophy by suppressing TNF-α levels, possibly via NF-κB. However, we found no change in NF-κB activity with unloading or EUK-134 at this stage of mechanical unloading. It is possible that under high levels (mM) of H2O2 EUK-134 may oxidize to oxo-EUK and quench nitric oxide (·NO) (37). While H2O2 levels in skeletal muscle are believed to exist in the high-nM to low-μM range, future experiments could specifically inhibit iNOS as a source of RNS. In addition, high levels of EUK-134 at the tissue level may also remove or prevent the production of peroxynitrite (OONO−). Thus, it is possible that nNOS may contribute to its own dislocation. It is also possible that mechanical unloading affects nNOS via transcriptional regulation rather than posttranslational mechanisms or interaction with other proteins (e.g., caveolin-3). These provocative questions should be foci of future investigations. In summary, translocation of nNOSμ during short-term mechanical unloading in the rat soleus was reduced by the SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134 and linked to protection against muscle fiber atrophy and fiber-type shift from slow to fast. In addition, prevention of nNOS translocation by EUK-134 was directly associated with protection against dephosphorylation of FoxO3a. Finally, EUK-134 reduced oxidative stress and normalized Nox2 levels. Our results suggest that loss of nNOSμ from the sarcolemma is an early, redox-dependent event in the response to mechanical unloading, linked to morphological changes in skeletal muscle phenotype.GRANTS Funding for this study was provided by support from the NASA Space Biology program (NNX12AR62G), National Institutes of Health (AR-054084), National Science Foundation (055185F), and the Sydney and J.

    "abstract": "Abstract Contractility of the heart is impaired with advancing age via mechanical remodeling, as myocytes are lost through apoptosis and collagenous fibers accumulate. Exercise training confers protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We recently reported that exercise training elevates Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the aging heart, concomitant with reduction in oxidative stress and fibrosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MnSOD would be causal in protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart. Hearts were extracted from young (8 months) wild-type, young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene, old (28 months) wild-type, and old transgenic mice. Left ventricle MnSOD protein levels were elevated in young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene and old transgenic mice. MnSODTg mice exhibited lower oxidative stress (total hydroperoxides, 4-hydroxynonenal, and 8-isoprostane) in the old group. Age-related cardiac remodeling and fibrosis was mitigated in MnSOD Tg mice with reductions in extramyocyte space (−65%), collagen-I, and transforming growth factor-β. Pro-apoptotic markers Bax (−38%) and caspase-3 cleavage (−41%) were reduced and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive nuclei, DNA laddering) was mitigated in MnSOD Tg hearts compared with old wild-type. We conclude that MnSOD elevation is indeed protective against oxidative stress, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the aging heart. Key Words: Aging, Heart, Superoxide dismutase, Oxidative stress, Fibrosis.",
    "introduction": "",
    "methods": "Methods Animals The Sod2 transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing MnSOD used in this study were obtained from Dr. Epstein’s Laboratory (24). A 13-kb genomic Sod2 clone isolated from C57BL/6J mice, which encompassed 2kb of the native Sod2 promoter, was used to generate Sod2 Tg mice. Subsequent generations of Sod2 Tg mice were bred by mating male Sod2 Tg mice to female C57BL/6J WT, purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were cared for at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio in accordance with National Institutes of Health and the institutional animal care committee standards. An animal use protocol had been approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio for all procedures used in the study. Male WT and Sod2 Tg mice were housed four per cage in a temperature-controlled (23 ± 2°C) room with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle. Water and mouse chow were provided ad libitum. Young adult (8 months) and old (28 months) mice were divided into the following groups: young adult (8 months) WT (YWT; n = 10), young adult MnSOD Tg (YTg; n = 10), old (28 mo) WT (OWT; n = 10), and old MnSOD Tg (OTg; n = 10) mice. Tissue Preparation Before collecting the heart, mice were euthanized using a CO2 chamber followed by cervical dislocation. The LV was quickly extracted, weighed, and placed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH = 7.4). The LV samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until analysis. We focused on the LV because it is the primary target in the aging heart with increased apoptosis and remodeling (5,9). Homogenization Procedure To measure markers of oxidative stress and the protein levels of apoptotic signaling, LV samples were minced into fine pieces and homogenized (20:1 w/v) in ice-cold (4°C) lysis buffer solution (pH = 7.4) containing the following: 20mM (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 350mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Igepal-CA630, 1mM MgCl2, 0.1mM dithiothreitol, 0.5mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.1mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Minced LV were homogenized using a ground glass on ground glass homogenizer (Bellco Biotechnology, Vineland, NJ) at 4°C, and then twice centrifuged (4°C) for 10 minutes at 10,000g with the supernatant extracted. Total protein was determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Histology and Immunofluorescence In our histological experiments, cross-sections of the LV were cut (10 µm thick) in a cryostat (Thermo-Fisher, Shandon Cryotome FSE) at −15°C, placed on slides, and air-dried for 30 minutes. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted at room temperature and utilized to localize cardiomyocyte nuclei, extramyocyte space, and geometry. Hematoxylin (QT) was also used as a counterstain for visualization at room temperature. In order to conduct immunofluorescence staining, sections were first dried for 30 minutes and then fixed in acetone (−20°C) for 10 minutes. Sample slides were next blocked with 10% serum of the secondary antibody with Tris-buffered saline (100 μL) for 30 minutes after three washes with PBS with Tween-20. After air drying for 10 minutes, primary antibodies (1:100 dilution) for collagen-I (SC-25974; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), TGF-β1 (MAB240; R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN), and laminin (L9393; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were applied and incubated for 60 minutes in blocking buffer at room temperature. After three 10 minutes washes in PBS, sections were incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) with a fluorochrome attached (eg, goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then washed three times in PBS and air-dried for 20 minutes. Samples were covered with 1.2-mm cover slide with ProLong mounting medium (Invitrogen). Collagen-I, TGF-β1, and laminin for all groups were completed in single day runs under the same conditions. Images were captured on an Olympus inverted epifluorescence microscope (IX51) fitted with a ×20 objective (numerical aperture: 0.45). Microscope and camera settings were kept constant throughout the process for each protein assessed using the Q-capture system. Images were quantified using the  ImageJ (Version 1.46) analysis program. Oxidative Stress Markers We measured total hydroperoxides as a marker of oxidative stress using the xylenol orange technique with FeSO4 (250 µM) in sulfuric acid (25mM) reacting with xylenol orange (100 µM) (25). The principle relies on the oxidization Fe2+ to Fe3+ when hydroperoxides are reduced. Ionized sulfuric acid assists in the reduction and prevents spontaneous reaction of Fe2+ with xylenol orange, unless oxidized by hydroperoxides first. The Fe3+ then reacts with the xylenol orange to form a Fe3+–xylenol complex and changes to a purple color. Absorbance of the purple Fe3+–xylenol complex was measured at 580nm. Concentrations of hydroperoxides were quantified against a t-butyl hydroperoxide standard curve. 8-Isoprostane was determined using a Cayman EIA kit. 4-Hydroxynonenal was assessed using a modified Western blot analysis. DNA Fragmentation Histone-associated DNA fragmentation was assessed using a cell death detection ELISA (Roche Applied Science). About 20 µL from supernatant was transferred into a microplate and 80 µL of the immunoreagent was added to each well, followed by gentle shaking of the plate for 2 hour at 25°C. Then, 100 µL of ABTS solution was pipetted to each well, and the solution was incubated on a plated shaker at 250rpm until the color development was sufficient for a photometric analysis (10 minutes). Finally, we measured absorbance of the oxidized ABTS solution at 405nm (reference wavelength of 490nm), using a microplate reader (Spectra Max 190; Molecular Devices). TUNEL-Positive Staining TUNEL evaluation of myonuclei positive for DNA strand breaks was determined using fluorescence detection (Roche Applied Science). Cross-sections of LV were cut (10 µm) in cryostat (−15°C), and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature in a Coplar jar. Sections were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 20 minutes at 4°C. The TUNEL reaction mixture containing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, fluorescein-dUTP was added to the sections in 50-µL drops and incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C in a humidified chamber in the dark. The sections were rinsed three times in PBS for 5 minutes each and mounted in Vector antifade media with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to tag all nuclei. Sections were then visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot2; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with parallel positive control (DNase-I) and negative controls (label solution only). TUNEL-positive nuclei were then counted on multiple sections of the LV. Western Immunoblot Protein levels for MnSOD, 4-hydroxynonenal adducts, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 were determined by Western immunoblot analysis, in a manner similar to the outline mentioned previously (4). About 30 µg of LV homogenate were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed using a Bio-Rad Protein III gel system. Briefly, solutions for separating gel (375mM Tris–HCl; pH = 8.8; 0.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate; 10% acrylamide) and stacking gel (125mM Tris–HCl; pH = 6.8; 0.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate; 10% acrylamide monomer) solutions were made, and polymerization was then initiated by tetramethylethylenediamine and ammonium persulfate. Separating and stacking gels were then quickly poured into a Bio-Rad Protein III gel-box (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). LV homogenates in sample buffer (Tris pH = 6.8 with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 30 mM DTT, 25% glycerol) were then electrophoresed at 150 V for 50 minutes. The gels were then transferred at 30 V overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 for 6 hours. After blocking, membranes were incubated at room temperature in blocking buffer for overnight with the appropriate primary antibodies in blocking buffer: MnSOD (1:10,000, SC-7977; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 4-hydroxynonenal (1:1,000, #393206; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), Bax (1:200, SC-6236; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and cleaved caspase-3 (1:500, #9661; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Following three membranes washings in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, membranes were then incubated in horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour. An enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech., Piscataway, NJ) was used for visualization. To ensure equal loading of protein, Ponceau-S staining was performed for each membrane. In addition, membranes were stripped and reprobed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:5,000, RGM2; Advanced Immunochemical, Long Beach, CA) to verify equal loading among lanes as an internal control. Densitometry (ie, area times grayscale relative to background) was performed using a Kodak film cartridge and film.  Image J analysis software was used for quantification of the blots. Statistics Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. Two-way analysis of variance with Fishers-least significant difference used post hoc where appropriate were used to determine the existence of mean differences among test groups. Analysis of variance with Tukey’s post hoc test was used for analyzing collagen-I and TGF-β1 signal intensity. Significance level was set at 0.05.",
    "results": "Results To demonstrate that MnSOD protein levels remained elevated in the old Tg mice, we measured protein abundance of LV from young (8 months) and old (28 months) WT and Sod2 Tg mice. As shown in Figure 1, the protein abundance of MnSOD in the LV was elevated by MnSOD genetic overexpression of YTg (+54%) compared with YWT mice. MnSOD protein abundance continued to be upregulated as well in the LV of OTg (+95%) compared with OWT. Total protein levels in the heart were not altered with age. Furthermore, we previously reported that MnSOD enzyme activity was increased approximately twofold in both young and old Tg mouse hearts (24). In summary, these data indicate that elevated MnSOD function was retained in Tg mice with advancing age. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protein expression in left ventricle samples of wild-type (WT) and Sod2 transgenic (Tg) mice assigned to the following groups: young adult (8 mo) wild-type (YWT), young adult Sod2 Tg (YTg), old (28 mo) WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg). Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “b” indicates a significant difference vs YTg (p < .05). “c” indicates a significant difference vs OWT (p < .05). We then tested the hypothesis that elevation of MnSOD protein levels reduced oxidative stress in the aging mouse heart. Indeed, hydroperoxide levels increased in the LV with age (+33%) but were decreased by MnSOD overexpression in the old (−29%) age group (Figure 2A). 8-Isoprostane was also measured as a marker of oxidative stress in heart from WT and MnSOD Tg mice. We found that 8-isoprostane was significantly elevated in the old WT, but not in the old Tg mice (Figure 2B). Similarly, 4-hydroxynonenal adducts, a marker of oxidative stress, were 20% higher in the LV of aging mice compared with young counterparts (Figure 2C). MnSOD overexpression significantly reduced 4-HNE by 31% in the LVs in the old age group (Figure 2C). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Total hydroperoxides (A), 8-isoprostane (B), and 4-hydroxynonenal adducts (C) in left ventricle samples of young adult wild-type (YWT), young adult Sod2 Tg (YTg), old WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg). Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “c” indicates a significant difference vs OWT (p < .05). We then assessed whether overexpression of the MnSOD gene and elevation of MnSOD protein levels protected against age-associated cardiac remodeling in mouse LV. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed significant structural changes in the LVs from old mice (Figure 3A and B). Extramyocyte space was dramatically greater in LVs from OWT than LVs from YWT (Figure 3C). In addition, the number of myonuclei per cross-sectional area from hematoxylin-stained sections was significantly decreased in the LVs from OWT compared with YWT (Figure 3D). These observations mirrored previous aging studies using the Fischer-344 strain of rat (4) and Fischer-344 × Brown Norway F1 hybrid strain of rat (21). In contrast, LV cross-sections from OTg exhibited less age-related cardiac remodeling than WTs, suggesting overexpression of MnSOD reduced cardiac remodeling in the aging LVs (Figure 3A–D). MnSOD overexpression and enhancement of protein levels also reduced extramyocyte space (−65%) in the OTg compared with OWT (Figure 3C). Furthermore, increasing MnSOD protein levels also enhanced the number of myonuclei (+191%) per cross-sectional area (Figure 3D). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Histologic cross-sections stained with hematoxylin (×16; A), hematoxylin and eosin (×20; B), percent (%) extramyocyte space (C), and number (D) of myonuclei per 100,000 µm2 area in left ventricle samples of young adult wild-type (YWT), young adult Sod2 Tg (YTg), old WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg). Unstained areas indicate extramyocyte space for hematoxylin staining.

Stage micrometer indicates 100 μm. To determine whether age and MnSOD overexpression-induced differences in extramyocyte space could be explained by changes in connective tissue, we measured collagen-I localization or positive staining. Consistent with extramyocyte space described previously, we found that significant collagen-I positive staining was visualized in the LV samples from OWT compared with YWT. In contrast, overexpression of MnSOD resulted in limited collagen-I positive staining (Figure 4A and B), consistent with the notion that MnSOD protection against extracellular matrix proliferation with old age was linked to reduced levels of collagen-I. In healthy, young hearts, a thin, linear layer of connective tissue surrounds “pods” of myocardial cells. Collagen-I and hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed a less linear and thicker layers of connective tissue surrounding cardiomyocytes. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Collagen type-I (top), 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole DAPI (middle), and merged (bottom) are visualized by immunofluorescence staining (A; ×16), and collagen type-I signal intensity is shown (B) in left ventricle samples of young adult wild-type (YWT), old WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg). Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “b” indicates a significant difference vs OWT (p < .05). In order to determine potential upstream mechanisms for protection against fibrosis in old hearts where MnSOD was overexpressed, we determined positive staining and protein abundance of the ECM-regulating cytokine TGF-β1, a consensus upstream regulator of fibrosis (26) and deposition of collagen-I and laminin. We used immunofluorescence staining with TGF-β1 and laminin-specific antibodies to visualize their location near the myocyte membrane and extramyocyte space. We found greater positive staining for TGF-β1 in LVs from the OWT mice compared with that from YWT (Figure 5A). Similar to the hematoxylin and eosin staining, a more web-like and alinear pattern was observed for TGF-β1 in the extramyocyte area (Figure 5B), as indicated by laminin-positive (Figure 5B) in LVs from OWT compared with YWT. Remarkably, MnSOD overexpression substantially mitigated age-induced elevation in TGF-β1 staining (Figure 5A and B), suggesting that MnSOD indeed protects against age-related fibrosis in the murine LVs. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1; top) and laminin (bottom; A) are visualized by immunofluorescence staining (×20), and TGF-β1 signal intensity is shown (B) in left ventricle samples of young adult wild-type (YWT), old WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg). Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “b” indicates a significant difference vs OWT (p < .05). Given that MnSOD is a mitochondrial-specific antioxidant enzyme, we tested the protective role of MnSOD overexpression against mitochondrial pro-apoptotic signaling (Bcl-2 pathway). Protein levels for Bax and cleaved (ie, active) caspase-3 were assessed in the LVs. No significant changes in Bax protein levels were found in the OWT compared with YWT. However, LVs from OTg exhibited significantly lower protein levels (−38%) for Bax by MnSOD overexpression (Figure 6A). Levels of cleaved caspase-3 (a marker of caspase-3 activation), downstream of the mitochondrial Bax (4), were significantly increased in the LVs of OWT compared with YWT (Figure 6B). Conversely, MnSOD overexpression resulted in a significant decrease (−41%) of cleaved caspase-3 protein levels in the LVs of old groups (Figure 6B). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Protein expression for Bax (A) and cleaved caspase-3 (B) using Western immunoblotting in left ventricle samples of young adult wild-type (YWT), young adult Sod2 Tg (YTg), old WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg). Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “b” indicates a significant difference vs YTg (p < .05). “c” indicates a significant difference vs OWT (p < .05). Given that enhancement of MnSOD levels provides significant protection against pro-apoptotic signaling (eg, Bax, cleaved caspase-3) in the aging heart, we tested the hypothesis that MnSOD overexpression would also mitigate age-induced elevation of apoptosis in the LV. Histone-associated DNA fragmentation and TUNEL-positive staining were used as direct markers of apoptosis and visualized using the TUNEL method with fluorescence microscopy. Positive controls revealed excellent co-localization with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and TUNEL-positive nuclei (Figure 7A). Representative TUNEL-positive nuclei and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorescence micrographs are shown in Figure 7A for LVs from YWT, OWT, and OTg groups, respectively. Aging increased TUNEL-positive nuclei in the LVs of WT mice. Conversely, MnSOD overexpression greatly reduced both markers of apoptosis in old Tg mice versus age-matched WTs. In addition, aging significantly increased histone-associated DNA fragmentation (Figure 7B) in the OWT LVs compared with YWT. MnSOD overexpression also attenuated DNA fragmentation in the LV in the old age group when compared with old WTs. In summary, these data indicate that the induction of MnSOD via genetic overexpression ameliorates the apoptotic process of myocytes in the LV of aging hearts. Figure 7.

    "discussion": "Discussion The goal of this study was to investigate the role of MnSOD in protection of fibrosis, apoptosis, and remodeling of the aging heart, by overexpressing the Sod2 gene. We found that Tg mice overexpressing MnSOD had reduced markers of oxidative stress (eg, total hydroperoxides, 4-HNE, 8-isoprostane) in the LV. MnSOD overexpression also attenuated age-associated elevation in extramyocyte space, collagen-I, and TGF-β1-positive staining in the LVs of old mice. In addition, enhancement of MnSOD proteins levels in Sod2 Tg mice protected against age-related increase of pro-apoptotic signaling (eg, Bax, cleaved caspase-3) and apoptosis (eg, TUNEL-positive nuclei, DNA fragmentation) in the LVs of mouse hearts. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that enhancement of MnSOD in the aging heart attenuates age-associated elevation in markers of oxidative stress and remodeling. Indeed, this is the first data to indicate that MnSOD overexpression has a protective effect against age-induced remodeling in the aging heart. A discussion of the primary findings follows. MnSOD Overexpression and Oxidative Stress in Aging Heart The MnSOD is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide anions (O2•−), produced from complexes I and III of the electron transport chain, to H2O2. H2O2 then diffuses out of mitochondrial matrix, or undergoes further reduction to water by other antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase or catalase. MnSOD is thus an important first defense against mitochondrial oxidative stress and protection of mitochondrial integrity (24). In this study, we showed that Sod2 Tg mice significantly expressed higher MnSOD protein levels in the LVs of both young and old mice (Figure 1). Consistent with these observations, our previous report showed that the activity of MnSOD increased approximately twofold in heart of Sod2 Tg mice (24). Although overexpression of MnSOD does not increase life span, it does reduce pathology (24). Overexpression of catalase localized in the mitochondria enhances longevity (27,28), suggesting that mitochondrial damage via H2O2 reduces life span. In addition, the heterozygous knockout (SOD−/+) exhibits significant pathology (20). Thus, mitochondrial function is critical to both health and longevity, and may be disrupted by oxidative stress. Consistent with previous observations, heterozygous knockout of the Sod2 gene demonstrates the importance of MnSOD role in the antioxidant defense system (11–15). Indeed, MnSOD Tg mice models with homozygous (Sod2 −/−) or heterozygous (Sod2 −/+) null mutations in the Sod2 gene display pathologic phenotypes. For example, Sod2 −/− knockout mice exhibited severe oxidative mitochondrial injury and cardiomyopathy (14,15). In addition, Sod2 −/+ mice also have decreased mitochondrial respiration and impaired activities of mitochondrial enzymes (13). Increased oxidative damage to mitochondria is typical of heterozygous knockout mice (11–13). Furthermore, Sod2 −/+ mice have a greater susceptibility to permeability transition pore opening and thus apoptosis (11,13). Therefore, protection against fibrosis and apoptosis observed in this study is consistent with the genetic ablation data for MnSOD. Moreover, it is possible that mitochondrial H2O2 may shorten life span, whereas elevated O2•− may enhance age-related pathology. However, additional study is warranted to test this hypothesis directly. Indeed, aging is characterized by enhanced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the heart (9,22,24,29,30). There is emerging evidence that oxidative stress plays a central role in pathophysiology such as insulin resistance, apoptosis, activation of NF-κB, and proteolytic systems (eg, calpains, caspase-3, ubiquitin/proteasome) (31–33). In this study, we observed elevation of total hydroperoxides, 4-HNE, and 8-isoprostane as markers of oxidative stress in the hearts with advancing age (Figure 2). Previously, MnSOD overexpression in skeletal muscle reduced protein carbonyls and F2-isoprostanes indicators of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress that were elevated with aging (24). This study is the first direct evidence that overexpression of MnSOD attenuates oxidative stress in the LV of old mammals, as indicated by lower total hydroperoxides, 4-HNE, and 8-isoprostane adducts. Although the mechanisms underlying reduced oxidative stress with MnSOD overexpression are not fully delineated, it is logical that reduced levels of mitochondrial superoxide in the old Tg mice may protect against lipid peroxide and radical formation via suppressing Haber-Weiss or Fenton reactions. Furthermore, our results also suggest an important role of mitochondrial superoxide in aging of the myocardium. Thus, MnSOD plays an important role in protecting the mitochondria from oxidative stress and damage by enzymatically scavenging superoxide anions generated as a by-product of the mitochondrial respiration. These results are consistent with previous findings, which indicated that cardiomyocytes of Sod2 −/+ mice were more sensitive to oxidative stress than those of Sod2 +/+ mice (14–16,20). MnSOD may protect against protonation of superoxide anions (O2•−), a highly reactive species, in old Tg mice. However, this hypothesis is untested. MnSOD protein levels were overexpressed in the young, but markers of oxidative stress were not reduced. This suggests that overexpression of MnSOD may be more effective when (a) reactive oxygen species levels are elevated or (b) mice are old. We have noticed in previous studies that the effect of exercise training on oxidative stress and apoptosis is more pronounced in older rats (4). Therefore, MnSOD performs an important protective role against oxidative damage and remodeling primarily in the aging heart. MnSOD Overexpression and Fibrosis in Aging Heart We also observed that MnSOD overexpression attenuated age-induced remodeling (eg, increased extramyocyte space, collagen-I) in the LVs of OTg (Figures 3 and 4). Previous data have demonstrated that cardiac remodeling occurs consistently with aging, characterized by a loss of cardiac myocytes, reactive hypertrophy of remaining cardiomyocytes, and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (4,8,34,35). Consistent with previous findings, old WT mice expressed higher level of pro-fibrotic proteins (collagen-I, TGF-β1) and resulted in a more web-like geometry of collagenous sheaths, with removal of more linear sheaths surrounding myocytes in the LV. Interestingly, our findings in old MnSOD Tg mirror previous data that demonstrate exercise training upregulates MnSOD and reduces fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging rat heart (4,8,9). This supports the notion that interventions, including exercise, that upregulate MnSOD play a protective role against remodeling in the aging heart. In this study, overexpression of MnSOD reduced markers of fibrosis (eg, extramyocyte space, collagen-I, TGF-β1). Thus, we have established three tenants. First, oxidative stress is indeed causal in the age-associated fibrotic process. Second, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species may play a role in fibrosis in the aging heart. Third, at least part of the mechanism of exercise protection against age-associated fibrosis and remodeling in the aging heart may be attributed to inducibility of MnSOD. Recent evidence has linked age-related cardiac fibrosis to elevated levels of TGF-β1, a potent stimulator of collagen synthesis via fibroblasts (8,36–39). Previously, we found that exercise training mitigated age-related upregulation of TGF-β1 in the FBNF1 rat (8). In this study, we observed that MnSOD overexpression substantially reduced levels of TGF-β1 (Figure 5) and collagen-I (Figure 4) in the aging LV of OTg mice versus age-matched WTs. These finding support the hypothesis that MnSOD is involved in inhibitory regulation of TGF-β1 and cardiac fibrosis. Further research is required to delineate the redox-sensitive mechanism(s) responsible for the link between MnSOD and TGF-β1 in ameliorating cardiac fibrosis in the aging heart. MnSOD Overexpression and Apoptosis in Aging Heart We expected that overexpression of MnSOD would reduce mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic signaling and apoptosis, as part of age-related remodeling. Oxidative stress can induce activation of the Bcl-2 family of pro-apoptotic proteins including Bax and downstream activation of caspase-3, a key promoter of apoptosis (21). Caspase-3 activation via cleavage of the pro-form is usually a consequence of an increase in mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and cytochrome c release (21,40). In this study, Sod2 Tg mice displayed significantly lower levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in hearts of the old age group compared with WT of the same age (Figure 6A and B). In addition, MnSOD overexpression also reduced direct markers of apoptosis in the aging LV: TUNEL-positive myonuclei and DNA fragmentation (Figure 7). Therefore, the current sets of data indicate that MnSOD protects against age-related elevation of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in the aging mouse heart. Our data are also consistent with previous studies establishing an inhibitory relationship between MnSOD and apoptosis. Previously, Van Remmen and colleagues(20) showed that heterozygous MnSOD (Sod2 −/+) knockout mice exhibited increased permeability transition pore and apoptosis in the heart. In addition, Majima and colleagues(41) reported that overexpression of MnSOD protected cells against cell death induced by alkaline condition in a mouse fibrosarcoma cell line. Lee and colleagues(42) recently demonstrated that exercise increased MnSOD levels and prevented ischemia–reperfusion-induced elevation of pro-apoptotic proteins in heart mitochondria. Therefore, emerging data, including our study, are consistent with the notion that upregulation of MnSOD via overexpression or exercise training (9) may indeed suppresses excess apoptosis in the aging heart (4). Study Limitations Unfortunately, we did not have enough frozen tissue remaining in the young Tg mice to complete TGF-β1 and collagen-I analyses, as well as Western blots on all four groups of mice. Thus, we may have missed a potential interactive effect of age and overexpression of MnSOD, and our conclusions are less robust. Because oxidative stress markers were not significantly depressed in the YTg group and collagen-I levels are low, we suspect a minimal effect in overexpressing MnSOD in the young group, but further study is warranted. TGF-β1-positive staining in the LV appears much different than both young and old WTs, suggesting a potential regulatory role of MnSOD on pro-fibrotic signaling. In addition, we were not able to measure in vivo cardiac function (echocardiography) or in an isolated heart preparation. Thus, we cannot be certain that blunting of fibrosis in remodeling in the OTg mice was accompanied by improved functional measures (eg, diastolic filling, shortening velocity, ejection fraction). Clearly, further study is warranted to elucidate the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying remodeling in the aging heart. In summary, MnSOD overexpression protected against oxidative stress, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the aging mouse heart. Age-related elevation of cardiac collagen-I and TGF-β were abrogated in the MnSOD Tg mouse. In addition, the old MnSOD Tg mouse experienced significant less pro-apoptotic signaling (Bax, cleaved caspase-3) than the old WT. We conclude that MnSOD is an important protective protein against fibrosis and remodeling in the aging heart. Our results are also consistent with the hypothesis that exercise-induced upregulation of MnSOD in the aging heart previously observed in our laboratory (9) may be cardioprotective against fibrosis (8) and apoptosis (4).",

Copyright notice ID: 4462657 PMID: 25016531 Abstract Contractility of the heart is impaired with advancing age via mechanical remodeling, as myocytes are lost through apoptosis and collagenous fibers accumulate. Exercise training confers protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We recently reported that exercise training elevates Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the aging heart, concomitant with reduction in oxidative stress and fibrosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MnSOD would be causal in protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart. Hearts were extracted from young (8 months) wild-type, young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene, old (28 months) wild-type, and old transgenic mice. Left ventricle MnSOD protein levels were elevated in young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene and old transgenic mice. MnSODTg mice exhibited lower oxidative stress (total hydroperoxides, 4-hydroxynonenal, and 8-isoprostane) in the old group. Age-related cardiac remodeling and fibrosis was mitigated in MnSOD Tg mice with reductions in extramyocyte space (−65%), collagen-I, and transforming growth factor-β. Pro-apoptotic markers Bax (−38%) and caspase-3 cleavage (−41%) were reduced and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive nuclei, DNA laddering) was mitigated in MnSOD Tg hearts compared with old wild-type. We conclude that MnSOD elevation is indeed protective against oxidative stress, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the aging heart. Key Words: Aging, Heart, Superoxide dismutase, Oxidative stress, Fibrosis. Aging reduces cardiac function due to impaired Ca2+ homeostasis (1,2) and progressive structural remodeling. Age-related remodeling includes the loss of cardiac myocytes, a product of increased apoptosis and necrosis as well as reduced replacement by progenitor cells (3–5). Indeed, the loss of cardiac myocytes increases exponentially with advancing age in the heart, although the impact may be gender-dependent (5,6). For example, aging resulted in approximately 30% reduction in the number of cardiac myocytes in 70-year-old man (7). In addition, remaining cardiac myocytes experience reactive hypertrophy, and there is an accumulation of connective tissue (ie, fibrosis) (8). Increased fibrotic tissue reduces cardiac filling and enhances the risk of chronic heart failure (2). Previously, we reported that treadmill exercise training reduced age-induced apoptosis and remodeling in the rat heart (4). In a follow-up study (5), we reported that exercise training reduced collagenous fibrosis that was associated with aging. Collagen-I and upstream regulatory proteins tissue inhibition of metalloproteinase-1 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were lower in the hearts of exercise trained rats. Treadmill exercise training also upregulated the mitochondrial cell protective Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and reduced oxidative stress in the aging heart (9). However, the causal relationship between elevation of MnSOD in the aging heart and reduction in fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart is unknown. MnSOD is an essential antioxidant enzyme located in the mitochondrial matrix, protecting proteins, lipids, and DNA. MnSOD catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide anion (O2•−) produced in the mitochondrial inner membrane to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (10,11). MnSOD has been shown to confer cardioprotection in a number of models. For example, homozygous MnSOD (Sod2 −/−) knockout mice exhibit impaired mitochondrial enzyme and high susceptibility to oxidative mitochondrial injury (12,13). Furthermore, Sod2 −/− mice have enlarged hearts with dilated left ventricles (LV), leading to early postnatal mortality (12). In addition, the heterozygous MnSOD (Sod2 − /+) knockout mouse expresses a phenotype characterized by impaired mitochondrial enzyme activity and respiration (14). Moreover, the Sod2 −/+ mouse has a higher probability of permeability transition pore opening (15) and oxidative damage to mitochondria (16) than wild-types (WT). In contrast, overexpression of MnSOD in transgenic mice appears to protect against oxidative stress, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, apoptosis, and in liver, brain, and skeletal muscle (10,17–19). Exercise enhances stress response including enhancement of MnSOD (20), heat-shock proteins (19), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (1,3). Indeed, upregulation of stress proteins may abrogate apoptosis and remodeling in the heart. Elevation of MnSOD is an attractive protection-mechanism of habitual exercise against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart because inducibility of MnSOD by exercise training is retained with age (9). Exercise may also attenuate redox-sensitive inflammatory cytokines (21), which stimulate cardiac remodeling. A primary source of elevated oxidative stress in the aging heart is believed to be complexes I and III of mitochondrial electron transport chain of the inner mitochondrial membrane (22). Furthermore, elevation of mitochondrial oxidative stress is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (22,23). Indeed, age-related elevation of oxidative stress has been linked to pro-apoptotic proteins (eg, Bax, Bad, Bid) resulting in increased permeability transition pore opening and subsequent activation of caspases-9 and -3 (21). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MnSOD (Sod2 Tg) would attenuate age-related remodeling. Specifically, we postulated that old MnSOD Tg would exhibit significantly lower levels of cardiac oxidative stress, fibrotic markers (collagen-I, TGF-β), and apoptosis (Bax, caspase-3 cleavage, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling [TUNEL]-positive staining, DNA fragmentation) compared with old WT. Methods Animals The Sod2 transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing MnSOD used in this study were obtained from Dr. Epstein’s Laboratory (24). A 13-kb genomic Sod2 clone isolated from C57BL/6J mice, which encompassed 2kb of the native Sod2 promoter, was used to generate Sod2 Tg mice. Subsequent generations of Sod2 Tg mice were bred by mating male Sod2 Tg mice to female C57BL/6J WT, purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were cared for at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio in accordance with National Institutes of Health and the institutional animal care committee standards. An animal use protocol had been approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio for all procedures used in the study. Male WT and Sod2 Tg mice were housed four per cage in a temperature-controlled (23 ± 2°C) room with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle. Water and mouse chow were provided ad libitum. Young adult (8 months) and old (28 months) mice were divided into the following groups: young adult (8 months) WT (YWT; n = 10), young adult MnSOD Tg (YTg; n = 10), old (28 mo) WT (OWT; n = 10), and old MnSOD Tg (OTg; n = 10) mice.Tissue Preparation Before collecting the heart, mice were euthanized using a CO2 chamber followed by cervical dislocation. The LV was quickly extracted, weighed, and placed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH = 7.4). The LV samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until analysis. We focused on the LV because it is the primary target in the aging heart with increased apoptosis and remodeling (5,9).Homogenization Procedure To measure markers of oxidative stress and the protein levels of apoptotic signaling, LV samples were minced into fine pieces and homogenized (20:1 w/v) in ice-cold (4°C) lysis buffer solution (pH = 7.4) containing the following: 20mM (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 350mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Igepal-CA630, 1mM MgCl2, 0.1mM dithiothreitol, 0.5mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.1mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Minced LV were homogenized using a ground glass on ground glass homogenizer (Bellco Biotechnology, Vineland, NJ) at 4°C, and then twice centrifuged (4°C) for 10 minutes at 10,000g with the supernatant extracted. Total protein was determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL).Histology and Immunofluorescence In our histological experiments, cross-sections of the LV were cut (10 µm thick) in a cryostat (Thermo-Fisher, Shandon Cryotome FSE) at −15°C, placed on slides, and air-dried for 30 minutes. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted at room temperature and utilized to localize cardiomyocyte nuclei, extramyocyte space, and geometry. Hematoxylin (QT) was also used as a counterstain for visualization at room temperature. In order to conduct immunofluorescence staining, sections were first dried for 30 minutes and then fixed in acetone (−20°C) for 10 minutes. Sample slides were next blocked with 10% serum of the secondary antibody with Tris-buffered saline (100 μL) for 30 minutes after three washes with PBS with Tween-20. After air drying for 10 minutes, primary antibodies (1:100 dilution) for collagen-I (SC-25974; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), TGF-β1 (MAB240; R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN), and laminin (L9393; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were applied and incubated for 60 minutes in blocking buffer at room temperature. After three 10 minutes washes in PBS, sections were incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) with a fluorochrome attached (eg, goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then washed three times in PBS and air-dried for 20 minutes. Samples were covered with 1.2-mm cover slide with ProLong mounting medium (Invitrogen). Collagen-I, TGF-β1, and laminin for all groups were completed in single day runs under the same conditions. Images were captured on an Olympus inverted epifluorescence microscope (IX51) fitted with a ×20 objective (numerical aperture: 0.45). Microscope and camera settings were kept constant throughout the process for each protein assessed using the Q-capture system. Images were quantified using the  ImageJ (Version 1.46) analysis program.Oxidative Stress Markers We measured total hydroperoxides as a marker of oxidative stress using the xylenol orange technique with FeSO4 (250 µM) in sulfuric acid (25mM) reacting with xylenol orange (100 µM) (25). The principle relies on the oxidization Fe2+ to Fe3+ when hydroperoxides are reduced. Ionized sulfuric acid assists in the reduction and prevents spontaneous reaction of Fe2+ with xylenol orange, unless oxidized by hydroperoxides first. The Fe3+ then reacts with the xylenol orange to form a Fe3+–xylenol complex and changes to a purple color. Absorbance of the purple Fe3+–xylenol complex was measured at 580nm. Concentrations of hydroperoxides were quantified against a t-butyl hydroperoxide standard curve. 8-Isoprostane was determined using a Cayman EIA kit. 4-Hydroxynonenal was assessed using a modified Western blot analysis.DNA Fragmentation Histone-associated DNA fragmentation was assessed using a cell death detection ELISA (Roche Applied Science). About 20 µL from supernatant was transferred into a microplate and 80 µL of the immunoreagent was added to each well, followed by gentle shaking of the plate for 2 hour at 25°C. Then, 100 µL of ABTS solution was pipetted to each well, and the solution was incubated on a plated shaker at 250rpm until the color development was sufficient for a photometric analysis (10 minutes). Finally, we measured absorbance of the oxidized ABTS solution at 405nm (reference wavelength of 490nm), using a microplate reader (Spectra Max 190; Molecular Devices).TUNEL-Positive Staining TUNEL evaluation of myonuclei positive for DNA strand breaks was determined using fluorescence detection (Roche Applied Science). Cross-sections of LV were cut (10 µm) in cryostat (−15°C), and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature in a Coplar jar. Sections were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 20 minutes at 4°C. The TUNEL reaction mixture containing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, fluorescein-dUTP was added to the sections in 50-µL drops and incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C in a humidified chamber in the dark. The sections were rinsed three times in PBS for 5 minutes each and mounted in Vector antifade media with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to tag all nuclei. Sections were then visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot2; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with parallel positive control (DNase-I) and negative controls (label solution only). TUNEL-positive nuclei were then counted on multiple sections of the LV.Western Immunoblot Protein levels for MnSOD, 4-hydroxynonenal adducts, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 were determined by Western immunoblot analysis, in a manner similar to the outline mentioned previously (4). About 30 µg of LV homogenate were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed using a Bio-Rad Protein III gel system. Briefly, solutions for separating gel (375mM Tris–HCl; pH = 8.8; 0.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate; 10% acrylamide) and stacking gel (125mM Tris–HCl; pH = 6.8; 0.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate; 10% acrylamide monomer) solutions were made, and polymerization was then initiated by tetramethylethylenediamine and ammonium persulfate. Separating and stacking gels were then quickly poured into a Bio-Rad Protein III gel-box (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). LV homogenates in sample buffer (Tris pH = 6.8 with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 30 mM DTT, 25% glycerol) were then electrophoresed at 150 V for 50 minutes. The gels were then transferred at 30 V overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 for 6 hours. After blocking, membranes were incubated at room temperature in blocking buffer for overnight with the appropriate primary antibodies in blocking buffer: MnSOD (1:10,000, SC-7977; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 4-hydroxynonenal (1:1,000, #393206; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), Bax (1:200, SC-6236; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and cleaved caspase-3 (1:500, #9661; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Following three membranes washings in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, membranes were then incubated in horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour. An enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech., Piscataway, NJ) was used for visualization. To ensure equal loading of protein, Ponceau-S staining was performed for each membrane. In addition, membranes were stripped and reprobed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:5,000, RGM2; Advanced Immunochemical, Long Beach, CA) to verify equal loading among lanes as an internal control. Densitometry (ie, area times grayscale relative to background) was performed using a Kodak film cartridge and film.  Image J analysis software was used for quantification of the blots.Statistics Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. Two-way analysis of variance with Fishers-least significant difference used post hoc where appropriate were used to determine the existence of mean differences among test groups. Analysis of variance with Tukey’s post hoc test was used for analyzing collagen-I and TGF-β1 signal intensity. Significance level was set at 0.05.Results To demonstrate that MnSOD protein levels remained elevated in the old Tg mice, we measured protein abundance of LV from young (8 months) and old (28 months) WT and Sod2 Tg mice. As shown in Figure 1, the protein abundance of MnSOD in the LV was elevated by MnSOD genetic overexpression of YTg (+54%) compared with YWT mice. MnSOD protein abundance continued to be upregulated as well in the LV of OTg (+95%) compared with OWT. Total protein levels in the heart were not altered with age. Furthermore, we previously reported that MnSOD enzyme activity was increased approximately twofold in both young and old Tg mouse hearts (24). In summary, these data indicate that elevated MnSOD function was retained in Tg mice with advancing age. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protein expression in left ventricle samples of wild-type (WT) and Sod2 transgenic (Tg) mice assigned to the following groups: young adult (8 mo) wild-type (YWT), young adult Sod2 Tg (YTg), old (28 mo) WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg). Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “b” indicates a significant difference vs YTg (p < .05). “c” indicates a significant difference vs OWT (p < .05).We then tested the hypothesis that elevation of MnSOD protein levels reduced oxidative stress in the aging mouse heart. Indeed, hydroperoxide levels increased in the LV with age (+33%) but were decreased by MnSOD overexpression in the old (−29%) age group (Figure 2A). 8-Isoprostane was also measured as a marker of oxidative stress in heart from WT and MnSOD Tg mice. We found that 8-isoprostane was significantly elevated in the old WT, but not in the old Tg mice (Figure 2B). Similarly, 4-hydroxynonenal adducts, a marker of oxidative stress, were 20% higher in the LV of aging mice compared with young counterparts (Figure 2C). MnSOD overexpression significantly reduced 4-HNE by 31% in the LVs in the old age group (Figure 2C). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Total hydroperoxides (A), 8-isoprostane (B), and 4-hydroxynonenal adducts (C) in left ventricle samples of young adult wild-type (YWT), young adult Sod2 Tg (YTg), old WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg). Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “c” indicates a significant difference vs OWT (p < .05).We then assessed whether overexpression of the MnSOD gene and elevation of MnSOD protein levels protected against age-associated cardiac remodeling in mouse LV. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed significant structural changes in the LVs from old mice (Figure 3A and B). Extramyocyte space was dramatically greater in LVs from OWT than LVs from YWT (Figure 3C). In addition, the number of myonuclei per cross-sectional area from hematoxylin-stained sections was significantly decreased in the LVs from OWT compared with YWT (Figure 3D). These observations mirrored previous aging studies using the Fischer-344 strain of rat (4) and Fischer-344 × Brown Norway F1 hybrid strain of rat (21). In contrast, LV cross-sections from OTg exhibited less age-related cardiac remodeling than WTs, suggesting overexpression of MnSOD reduced cardiac remodeling in the aging LVs (Figure 3A–D). MnSOD overexpression and enhancement of protein levels also reduced extramyocyte space (−65%) in the OTg compared with OWT (Figure 3C). Furthermore, increasing MnSOD protein levels also enhanced the number of myonuclei (+191%) per cross-sectional area (Figure 3D). Figure 3.

Unstained areas indicate extramyocyte space for hematoxylin staining. Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “b” indicates a significant difference vs YTg (p < .05). “c” indicates a significant difference vs OWT (p < .05). Stage micrometer indicates 100 μm.To determine whether age and MnSOD overexpression-induced differences in extramyocyte space could be explained by changes in connective tissue, we measured collagen-I localization or positive staining. Consistent with extramyocyte space described previously, we found that significant collagen-I positive staining was visualized in the LV samples from OWT compared with YWT. In contrast, overexpression of MnSOD resulted in limited collagen-I positive staining (Figure 4A and B), consistent with the notion that MnSOD protection against extracellular matrix proliferation with old age was linked to reduced levels of collagen-I. In healthy, young hearts, a thin, linear layer of connective tissue surrounds “pods” of myocardial cells. Collagen-I and hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed a less linear and thicker layers of connective tissue surrounding cardiomyocytes. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Collagen type-I (top), 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole DAPI (middle), and merged (bottom) are visualized by immunofluorescence staining (A; ×16), and collagen type-I signal intensity is shown (B) in left ventricle samples of young adult wild-type (YWT), old WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg). Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “b” indicates a significant difference vs OWT (p < .05).In order to determine potential upstream mechanisms for protection against fibrosis in old hearts where MnSOD was overexpressed, we determined positive staining and protein abundance of the ECM-regulating cytokine TGF-β1, a consensus upstream regulator of fibrosis (26) and deposition of collagen-I and laminin. We used immunofluorescence staining with TGF-β1 and laminin-specific antibodies to visualize their location near the myocyte membrane and extramyocyte space. We found greater positive staining for TGF-β1 in LVs from the OWT mice compared with that from YWT (Figure 5A). Similar to the hematoxylin and eosin staining, a more web-like and alinear pattern was observed for TGF-β1 in the extramyocyte area (Figure 5B), as indicated by laminin-positive (Figure 5B) in LVs from OWT compared with YWT. Remarkably, MnSOD overexpression substantially mitigated age-induced elevation in TGF-β1 staining (Figure 5A and B), suggesting that MnSOD indeed protects against age-related fibrosis in the murine LVs. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1; top) and laminin (bottom; A) are visualized by immunofluorescence staining (×20), and TGF-β1 signal intensity is shown (B) in left ventricle samples of young adult wild-type (YWT), old WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg). Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “b” indicates a significant difference vs OWT (p < .05).Given that MnSOD is a mitochondrial-specific antioxidant enzyme, we tested the protective role of MnSOD overexpression against mitochondrial pro-apoptotic signaling (Bcl-2 pathway). Protein levels for Bax and cleaved (ie, active) caspase-3 were assessed in the LVs. No significant changes in Bax protein levels were found in the OWT compared with YWT. However, LVs from OTg exhibited significantly lower protein levels (−38%) for Bax by MnSOD overexpression (Figure 6A). Levels of cleaved caspase-3 (a marker of caspase-3 activation), downstream of the mitochondrial Bax (4), were significantly increased in the LVs of OWT compared with YWT (Figure 6B). Conversely, MnSOD overexpression resulted in a significant decrease (−41%) of cleaved caspase-3 protein levels in the LVs of old groups (Figure 6B). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Protein expression for Bax (A) and cleaved caspase-3 (B) using Western immunoblotting in left ventricle samples of young adult wild-type (YWT), young adult Sod2 Tg (YTg), old WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg). Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “b” indicates a significant difference vs YTg (p < .05). “c” indicates a significant difference vs OWT (p < .05).Given that enhancement of MnSOD levels provides significant protection against pro-apoptotic signaling (eg, Bax, cleaved caspase-3) in the aging heart, we tested the hypothesis that MnSOD overexpression would also mitigate age-induced elevation of apoptosis in the LV. Histone-associated DNA fragmentation and TUNEL-positive staining were used as direct markers of apoptosis and visualized using the TUNEL method with fluorescence microscopy. Positive controls revealed excellent co-localization with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and TUNEL-positive nuclei (Figure 7A). Representative TUNEL-positive nuclei and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorescence micrographs are shown in Figure 7A for LVs from YWT, OWT, and OTg groups, respectively. Aging increased TUNEL-positive nuclei in the LVs of WT mice. Conversely, MnSOD overexpression greatly reduced both markers of apoptosis in old Tg mice versus age-matched WTs. In addition, aging significantly increased histone-associated DNA fragmentation (Figure 7B) in the OWT LVs compared with YWT. MnSOD overexpression also attenuated DNA fragmentation in the LV in the old age group when compared with old WTs. In summary, these data indicate that the induction of MnSOD via genetic overexpression ameliorates the apoptotic process of myocytes in the LV of aging hearts. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive staining (A) is visualized by immunofluorescence staining (×40) in left ventricle (LV) samples of young adult wild-type (YWT), old WT (OWT), and old Sod2 Tg (OTg), and DNA fragmentation (B) was used as a marker of apoptosis through quantification of mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes via ELISA in LV samples of YWT, young adult Sod2 Tg (YTg), OWT, and OTg. Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. “a” indicates a significant difference vs YWT (p < .05). “b” indicates a significant difference vs YTg (p < .05).Discussion The goal of this study was to investigate the role of MnSOD in protection of fibrosis, apoptosis, and remodeling of the aging heart, by overexpressing the Sod2 gene. We found that Tg mice overexpressing MnSOD had reduced markers of oxidative stress (eg, total hydroperoxides, 4-HNE, 8-isoprostane) in the LV. MnSOD overexpression also attenuated age-associated elevation in extramyocyte space, collagen-I, and TGF-β1-positive staining in the LVs of old mice. In addition, enhancement of MnSOD proteins levels in Sod2 Tg mice protected against age-related increase of pro-apoptotic signaling (eg, Bax, cleaved caspase-3) and apoptosis (eg, TUNEL-positive nuclei, DNA fragmentation) in the LVs of mouse hearts. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that enhancement of MnSOD in the aging heart attenuates age-associated elevation in markers of oxidative stress and remodeling. Indeed, this is the first data to indicate that MnSOD overexpression has a protective effect against age-induced remodeling in the aging heart. A discussion of the primary findings follows. MnSOD Overexpression and Oxidative Stress in Aging Heart The MnSOD is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide anions (O2•−), produced from complexes I and III of the electron transport chain, to H2O2. H2O2 then diffuses out of mitochondrial matrix, or undergoes further reduction to water by other antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase or catalase. MnSOD is thus an important first defense against mitochondrial oxidative stress and protection of mitochondrial integrity (24). In this study, we showed that Sod2 Tg mice significantly expressed higher MnSOD protein levels in the LVs of both young and old mice (Figure 1). Consistent with these observations, our previous report showed that the activity of MnSOD increased approximately twofold in heart of Sod2 Tg mice (24). Although overexpression of MnSOD does not increase life span, it does reduce pathology (24). Overexpression of catalase localized in the mitochondria enhances longevity (27,28), suggesting that mitochondrial damage via H2O2 reduces life span. In addition, the heterozygous knockout (SOD−/+) exhibits significant pathology (20). Thus, mitochondrial function is critical to both health and longevity, and may be disrupted by oxidative stress. Consistent with previous observations, heterozygous knockout of the Sod2 gene demonstrates the importance of MnSOD role in the antioxidant defense system (11–15). Indeed, MnSOD Tg mice models with homozygous (Sod2 −/−) or heterozygous (Sod2 −/+) null mutations in the Sod2 gene display pathologic phenotypes. For example, Sod2 −/− knockout mice exhibited severe oxidative mitochondrial injury and cardiomyopathy (14,15). In addition, Sod2 −/+ mice also have decreased mitochondrial respiration and impaired activities of mitochondrial enzymes (13). Increased oxidative damage to mitochondria is typical of heterozygous knockout mice (11–13). Furthermore, Sod2 −/+ mice have a greater susceptibility to permeability transition pore opening and thus apoptosis (11,13). Therefore, protection against fibrosis and apoptosis observed in this study is consistent with the genetic ablation data for MnSOD. Moreover, it is possible that mitochondrial H2O2 may shorten life span, whereas elevated O2•− may enhance age-related pathology. However, additional study is warranted to test this hypothesis directly. Indeed, aging is characterized by enhanced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the heart (9,22,24,29,30). There is emerging evidence that oxidative stress plays a central role in pathophysiology such as insulin resistance, apoptosis, activation of NF-κB, and proteolytic systems (eg, calpains, caspase-3, ubiquitin/proteasome) (31–33). In this study, we observed elevation of total hydroperoxides, 4-HNE, and 8-isoprostane as markers of oxidative stress in the hearts with advancing age (Figure 2). Previously, MnSOD overexpression in skeletal muscle reduced protein carbonyls and F2-isoprostanes indicators of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress that were elevated with aging (24). This study is the first direct evidence that overexpression of MnSOD attenuates oxidative stress in the LV of old mammals, as indicated by lower total hydroperoxides, 4-HNE, and 8-isoprostane adducts. Although the mechanisms underlying reduced oxidative stress with MnSOD overexpression are not fully delineated, it is logical that reduced levels of mitochondrial superoxide in the old Tg mice may protect against lipid peroxide and radical formation via suppressing Haber-Weiss or Fenton reactions. Furthermore, our results also suggest an important role of mitochondrial superoxide in aging of the myocardium. Thus, MnSOD plays an important role in protecting the mitochondria from oxidative stress and damage by enzymatically scavenging superoxide anions generated as a by-product of the mitochondrial respiration. These results are consistent with previous findings, which indicated that cardiomyocytes of Sod2 −/+ mice were more sensitive to oxidative stress than those of Sod2 +/+ mice (14–16,20). MnSOD may protect against protonation of superoxide anions (O2•−), a highly reactive species, in old Tg mice. However, this hypothesis is untested. MnSOD protein levels were overexpressed in the young, but markers of oxidative stress were not reduced. This suggests that overexpression of MnSOD may be more effective when (a) reactive oxygen species levels are elevated or (b) mice are old. We have noticed in previous studies that the effect of exercise training on oxidative stress and apoptosis is more pronounced in older rats (4). Therefore, MnSOD performs an important protective role against oxidative damage and remodeling primarily in the aging heart.MnSOD Overexpression and Fibrosis in Aging Heart We also observed that MnSOD overexpression attenuated age-induced remodeling (eg, increased extramyocyte space, collagen-I) in the LVs of OTg (Figures 3 and 4). Previous data have demonstrated that cardiac remodeling occurs consistently with aging, characterized by a loss of cardiac myocytes, reactive hypertrophy of remaining cardiomyocytes, and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (4,8,34,35). Consistent with previous findings, old WT mice expressed higher level of pro-fibrotic proteins (collagen-I, TGF-β1) and resulted in a more web-like geometry of collagenous sheaths, with removal of more linear sheaths surrounding myocytes in the LV. Interestingly, our findings in old MnSOD Tg mirror previous data that demonstrate exercise training upregulates MnSOD and reduces fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging rat heart (4,8,9). This supports the notion that interventions, including exercise, that upregulate MnSOD play a protective role against remodeling in the aging heart. In this study, overexpression of MnSOD reduced markers of fibrosis (eg, extramyocyte space, collagen-I, TGF-β1). Thus, we have established three tenants. First, oxidative stress is indeed causal in the age-associated fibrotic process. Second, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species may play a role in fibrosis in the aging heart. Third, at least part of the mechanism of exercise protection against age-associated fibrosis and remodeling in the aging heart may be attributed to inducibility of MnSOD. Recent evidence has linked age-related cardiac fibrosis to elevated levels of TGF-β1, a potent stimulator of collagen synthesis via fibroblasts (8,36–39). Previously, we found that exercise training mitigated age-related upregulation of TGF-β1 in the FBNF1 rat (8). In this study, we observed that MnSOD overexpression substantially reduced levels of TGF-β1 (Figure 5) and collagen-I (Figure 4) in the aging LV of OTg mice versus age-matched WTs. These finding support the hypothesis that MnSOD is involved in inhibitory regulation of TGF-β1 and cardiac fibrosis. Further research is required to delineate the redox-sensitive mechanism(s) responsible for the link between MnSOD and TGF-β1 in ameliorating cardiac fibrosis in the aging heart.MnSOD Overexpression and Apoptosis in Aging Heart We expected that overexpression of MnSOD would reduce mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic signaling and apoptosis, as part of age-related remodeling. Oxidative stress can induce activation of the Bcl-2 family of pro-apoptotic proteins including Bax and downstream activation of caspase-3, a key promoter of apoptosis (21). Caspase-3 activation via cleavage of the pro-form is usually a consequence of an increase in mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and cytochrome c release (21,40). In this study, Sod2 Tg mice displayed significantly lower levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in hearts of the old age group compared with WT of the same age (Figure 6A and B). In addition, MnSOD overexpression also reduced direct markers of apoptosis in the aging LV: TUNEL-positive myonuclei and DNA fragmentation (Figure 7). Therefore, the current sets of data indicate that MnSOD protects against age-related elevation of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in the aging mouse heart. Our data are also consistent with previous studies establishing an inhibitory relationship between MnSOD and apoptosis. Previously, Van Remmen and colleagues(20) showed that heterozygous MnSOD (Sod2 −/+) knockout mice exhibited increased permeability transition pore and apoptosis in the heart. In addition, Majima and colleagues(41) reported that overexpression of MnSOD protected cells against cell death induced by alkaline condition in a mouse fibrosarcoma cell line. Lee and colleagues(42) recently demonstrated that exercise increased MnSOD levels and prevented ischemia–reperfusion-induced elevation of pro-apoptotic proteins in heart mitochondria. Therefore, emerging data, including our study, are consistent with the notion that upregulation of MnSOD via overexpression or exercise training (9) may indeed suppresses excess apoptosis in the aging heart (4).Study Limitations Unfortunately, we did not have enough frozen tissue remaining in the young Tg mice to complete TGF-β1 and collagen-I analyses, as well as Western blots on all four groups of mice. Thus, we may have missed a potential interactive effect of age and overexpression of MnSOD, and our conclusions are less robust. Because oxidative stress markers were not significantly depressed in the YTg group and collagen-I levels are low, we suspect a minimal effect in overexpressing MnSOD in the young group, but further study is warranted. TGF-β1-positive staining in the LV appears much different than both young and old WTs, suggesting a potential regulatory role of MnSOD on pro-fibrotic signaling. In addition, we were not able to measure in vivo cardiac function (echocardiography) or in an isolated heart preparation. Thus, we cannot be certain that blunting of fibrosis in remodeling in the OTg mice was accompanied by improved functional measures (eg, diastolic filling, shortening velocity, ejection fraction). Clearly, further study is warranted to elucidate the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying remodeling in the aging heart. In summary, MnSOD overexpression protected against oxidative stress, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the aging mouse heart. Age-related elevation of cardiac collagen-I and TGF-β were abrogated in the MnSOD Tg mouse. In addition, the old MnSOD Tg mouse experienced significant less pro-apoptotic signaling (Bax, cleaved caspase-3) than the old WT. We conclude that MnSOD is an important protective protein against fibrosis and remodeling in the aging heart. Our results are also consistent with the hypothesis that exercise-induced upregulation of MnSOD in the aging heart previously observed in our laboratory (9) may be cardioprotective against fibrosis (8) and apoptosis (4).Funding This study was supported by the American Heart Association (0555064Y and 0855158F), National Institutes of Health (AR054084), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA; NNX12AR62G), and the Sydney and J.

Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. However, the efficacy of CR and WR with CR to attenuate caspase-independent apoptosis and preserve HSPs in aging skeletal muscle are unknown.

Keywords: EndoG, HSP27, aging, caloric restriction, wheel running, exerciseINTRODUCTION Skeletal muscles in mammals suffer from a progressive loss of muscle mass and function with advancing age, a process known as sarcopenia. The mechanisms responsible for sarcopenia are believed to be multi-factorial. From an epidemiological standpoint, impaired neuromuscular (e.g., loss of β-motor neurons) and endocrine (e.g., low testosterone, growth hormone, thyroxine levels, and increased insulin resistance) function, poor nutritional status, and physical inactivity have all been implicated (Dreyer and Volpi 2005; Lee and others 2007; Szulc and others 2004). At the cellular level, a host of etiological candidates driving sarcopenia include apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and insufficient stress response including heat shock proteins (HSPs) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) (Jensen 2008; Marzetti and others 2008b). Apoptosis is a highly conserved set of programs activated by diverse internal and external stimuli leading to cell rounding, DNA fragmentation, plasma membrane blebbing, and removal of nuclei and cells, as well as proteolysis. Because skeletal muscles are post-mitotic and multinucleated, apoptotic signaling contributes to both fiber death and a reduction in fiber cross-sectional area by removal of myonuclei and satellite cells during disease, inactivity, and aging (Alway and others 2002; Leeuwenburgh and others 2005; Siu and others 2005). Signaling pathways of apoptosis are dependent or independent of cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases (caspase) endonucleases. Caspase-dependent pathways include TNF-alpha and cytokine receptor (caspase-8 dependent), the mitochondrial Bcl-2 (caspase-9 dependent), and SR/Ca2+ stress (caspase-12 dependent) pathways. Caspase-independent mediators, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG), also induce apoptosis. However, limited studies have implicated the involvement of caspase-independent apoptotic signaling as a potential etiological factor in aging skeletal muscle. Leeuwenburgh et al., (Leeuwenburgh and others 2005) demonstrated that EndoG is co-localized with the nucleus and augmented in aged soleus muscle. Marzetti and colleagues (Marzetti and others 2008c) also reported that cytosolic and nuclear levels of EndoG and AIF are higher in aged gastrocnemius muscle than in adult control. In addition, translocation of EndoG to the nucleus has also been linked to atrophy with disuse (Dupont-Versteegden and others 2006), particularly in old rats (Leeuwenburgh and others 2005). Exercise training using either forced treadmill or voluntary wheel running regimens has been well known to convey benefits as an intervention against sarcopenia, including an involvement of caspase-dependent apoptosis (Marzetti and others 2008a; Song and others 2006). Exercise training also elevates heat shock proteins including HSP27 and HSP70 (Starnes and others 2005), which are thought to be cell protective upstream regulating caspase-dependent and independent pathways in disuse and aging models (CL Williamson 2007; McArdle and others 2004). However, HSP protection of exercise training against EndoG and AIF in skeletal muscle is poorly understood. Caloric restriction, one of the most robust interventions to extend mean and maximum life span and retard many age-related diseases, may also attenuate age-associated muscle atrophy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and especially apoptosis via caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling pathways. Dirks et al.,(Dirks and Leeuwenburgh 2004) demonstrated that moderate caloric restriction (40%) attenuated the age-induced increase in apoptosis by reducing caspase-12 and caspase-3 protein levels in gastrocnemius muscle. Indeed, Wohlgemuth and colleagues (Wohlgemuth and others 2010) reported that mild calorie restriction (8%) combined with long-term voluntary exercise could significantly attenuate the age-induced increase in apoptotic DNA fragmentation in rat skeletal muscle. However, the role of long-term mild caloric restriction on caspase-independent apoptotic signaling (e.g., EndoG, AIF) remains unknown. Although the effectiveness of forced and voluntary exercises as well as mild and moderate caloric restrictions on sarcopenia and apoptosis need to be fully compared, in the current study wheel running as a form of voluntary exercise and mild caloric restriction has been examined because those experimental models are easier to sustain and more adaptable to human models. Despite the great importance of long-term exercise and caloric restriction in reducing sarcopenia, the effect of long-term, voluntary exercise and caloric restriction on EndoG and AIF remain unknown in aging muscle. Therefore, we hypothesized that long-term caloric restriction and wheel running exercise with caloric restriction will attenuate the age-associated apoptosis via caspase-independent EndoG and AIF signaling, which is associated with an upregulation in HSPs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of long-term exercise and mild caloric restriction on skeletal muscle caspase-independent apoptosis in aged rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Male Fischer 344 rats were purchased from the Harlan colony (Indianapolis, IN) at 10–11 weeks of age. Animal Care Services facilities and all procedures had been approved by the University of Florida’s Institute on Animal Care and Use Committee. All rats were singly housed in a pathogen-free conditioned room in a temperature 20±2.5°C, and kept on a room with a 12h light: 12h dark diurnal cycle. Water and rat chow (Harlan Teklad Rodent Diet #8604) composed of a high protein (24.5%), carbohydrate including hemicelluloses (46.6%), low fat (4.4%), vitamins and minerals were given to animals and food intake for the caloric restricted groups and wheel running + caloric restriction groups was reduced by 8% below compared with age-matched ad libitum group.Experimental design After acclimatization for at least one-week in the animal facility, age-matched rats were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: 1) 6-month-old sedentary ad libitum group (YAL; n=12), 2) 24-month-old sedentary ad libitum group (OAL; n=12), 3) long-term 8% caloric restriction (CR) from 11 weeks until 24 months (OCR; n=12), 4) long-term voluntary wheel running exercise (WR) with CR from 11 weeks until 24 months (OExCR; n=12). Rats fed an ad libitum diet tend to abruptly decrease their running activity within 6 months, but mild caloric restriction (8–10%) has been previously shown to prevent this decline with age (McCarter and others 1997). The amount of food intake of OCR and OExCR group was controlled weekly based on ad libitum food intake from the previous week with adequate nutrition provided (vitamins, minerals). All rats in the sedentary group were housed in standard rodent cages, with Nalgene Activity Wheels obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) assembled in the same cage for OExCR group. Each wheel was 1.08m in circumference and equipped with a magnetic switch and a LCD counter to record the number of wheel revolutions and distance per day. Rats in OAL, OCR, and OExCR group continued their regimen from 11 weeks of age until 24 months of age and time of sacrifice. We selected the plantaris muscles because 1) plantaris muscles are mainly comprised of type II fast-twitch fibers which are affected by age-induced muscle atrophy and dysfunction; and 2) In a previous study we found that age-related plantaris muscle atrophy and increased connective tissue and extracellular matrix have been attenuated by both mild caloric restriction and lifelong wheel running exercise with mild caloric restriction. Body mass, plantaris muscle mass and muscle fiber cross sectional area in four groups have been previously reported (Kim and others 2008).Homogenization, cytosol & nucleosome tissue fractionization Rats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane 1L/min O2 and sacrificed via heart puncture. Upon sacrifice, plantaris muscles were rapidly removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at −80°C until subsequent analysis. The muscle was minced into fine pieces, weighted and suspended (50:1 w/v) in ice-cold complete lysis buffer (pH=7.4) comprised of the following: 20 mM HEPES, 350 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Igepal-CA630, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). Each plantaris was homogenized in a ground glass-on-ground glass homogenizer (Bellco Biotechnology; Vineland, NJ) at 4°C. Cytosolic and nucleosome muscle fractions were isolated for analysis as adapted from Zheng et al., (Zheng and others 2001). The plantaris samples were homogenized (7:1 w/v) in lysis buffer A containing 20mM HEPES free acid, 10mM HEPES Na salt, 350mM mannitol, 10% glycerol, 25mM KCl, and 0.5mM EDTA, and first centrifuged (4°C) for 10 min at 3,000g. The supernatant was separated from the pellet and then further centrifuged (4°C) for 10 min at 10,000g to get the soluble or cytosolic fraction. The supernatant acquired from the centrifugation contained the mitochondria and was verified using MnSOD immunoblotting. The first pellet was resuspended (9:1 v/v) in complete lysis buffer B containing 20mM HEPES free acid, 20mM HEPES Na salt, 350mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1mM MgCl2, and 0.5mM EDTA, and centrifuged again for 30 min at 12,000g and 4°C. The supernatant was removed as the nuclear fraction. PARP (poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase) in the first supernatant (cytosolic fraction) vs. the nucleosome fraction in the resuspended the second pellet were used as markers to assure the efficacy of the procedure in separating the nucleosome fraction from soluble fraction. Protein concentration was measured using BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) using a spectrophotometer at 562 nm absorbance.Western immunoblot analysis Protein levels were measured by Western immunoblot analysis. Separating gel (375 mM Tris-HCl; pH=8.8; 0.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS); 10% acrylamide) and stacking gel (125 mM Tris-HCl; pH=6.8; 0.4% SDS; 10% acrylamide monomer) solutions were made, and polymerization then was initiated by N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylene diamine (TEMED) and ammonium persulfate (APS). Separating and stacking gels were then quickly poured into a Bio-Rad Protein III gel-box (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Twenty to thirty μg of protein from plantaris homogenates in sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH=6.8, 2% SDS, 30 mM dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol) were then loaded into the wells of the 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and electrophoresed at 150V for 60 min. The gels were then transferred at 30V overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 for 7 hours. After blocking, membranes were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature overnight with the appropriate primary antibodies: anti-HSP70 (Stressgen, 1:7500), anti-HSF1 (Santa Cruz, 1:200), anti-HSP27 (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), anti-P-HSP27 at Ser82 (Cell Signaling, 1:500), anti-HSP90 (Stressgen,1:2500), anti-EndoG (ProScience, 1:1500), anti-AIF (Santa Cruz, 1:500). Following three washings in PBS with 0.4% Tween-20, membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies in PBS at room temperature for 90 min. After three times of washings in PBS with 0.4% Tween-20, an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) was used for visualization. Densitometry and quantification were performed using a Kodak film cartridge, a scanner interfaced with a microcomputer, and the  Image J Analysis software program. Background from each was subtracted to ensure optimal comparison between lanes. Ponceau-S-staining and anti-β-Actin (Sigma, 1:3000) were used to loading controls.Statistical Analysis All data were indicated as mean ± standard errors of the mean (SEM) and analyzed with one-way ANOVAs to determine the mean differences among YAL, OAL, OCR, and OExCR using Prism 4.0.3 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The Fisher-LSD test was used for the post-hoc comparisons. The level of significance was set at P<0.05.RESULTS EndoG and AIF protein levels We quantified EndoG and AIF protein levels in the plantaris muscle of the YAL, OAL, OCR, and OExCR rats. The protein abundance for EndoG in the soluble (mitochondrial) fraction was not different in old control (OAL; +17%) compared with young control (YAL). Further, EndoG was not affected by caloric restriction and lifelong wheel running (Figure 1A). However, there was a striking increase (+153%, p<0.001) in EndoG protein level in nucleosome fraction with age in the ad libitum group (Figure 1B). When we tested the effectiveness of long-term interventions, 8% caloric restriction attenuated the age-associated increase in the levels of EndoG in nuclear fraction (−38%, p=0.002). In addition, lifelong wheel running exercise with mild caloric restriction also mitigated upregulation of nuclear EndoG levels (−46%, p<0.001). Thus mild caloric restriction and exercise with caloric restriction may slow or prevent age-induced increase in pro-apoptotic EndoG signaling by limiting translocation from cytosol to nucleus. Figure 1. Open in a new tab EndoG protein levels in (A) soluble fraction and (B) nuclear fraction in young (6 mo.) Fischer-344 rats fed ad libitum (YA), old (24 mo.) rats fed ad libitum (OA), old rats that underwent lifelong 8% caloric restriction (OCR), and old rats that participated in lifelong voluntary wheel running plus 8% caloric restriction (OExCR). Values are means±SEM. (a) Indicates significant difference from YA group. (b) Indicates significant difference from OA group.In contrast, when we evaluated protein levels of AIF in isolated soluble and nuclear fractions from plantaris muscles we observed no changes in content with age. In addition, no significant alterations were noted with either caloric restriction or wheel running with caloric restriction (Figure 2A & 2B). Thus, we conclude that caloric restriction and exercise with caloric restriction preferentially target caspase-independent EndoG signaling in the plantaris muscle. Figure 2. Open in a new tab AIF protein levels in (A) soluble fraction and (B) nuclear fraction in young (6 mo.) Fischer-344 rats fed ad libitum (YA), old (24 mo.) rats fed ad libitum (OA), old rats that underwent lifelong 8% caloric restriction (OCR), and old rats that participated in lifelong voluntary wheel running plus 8% caloric restriction (OExCR). Values are means±SEM. (a) Indicates significant difference from YA group. (b) Indicates significant difference from OA group.Age-associated changes in HSPs with caloric restriction and exercise HSP27 protein levels were significantly lower in OAL (−63%, p=0.013) as compared to YAL (Figure 3A). Caloric restriction increased total HSP27 protein levels in the plantaris by 136% (p=0.049) compared with old rats exposed to ad libitum feeding. Moreover, voluntary exercise with mild caloric restriction also significantly increased HSP27 protein levels of the plantaris muscle by 155% (p=0.026) (Figure 3A). Figure 3. Open in a new tab (A) HSP27 and (B) phosphorylated (p)-HSP27 at Ser82 protein levels in young (6 mo.) Fischer-344 rats fed ad libitum (YA), old (24 mo.) rats fed ad libitum (OA), old rats that underwent lifelong 8% caloric restriction (OCR), and old rats that participated in lifelong voluntary wheel running plus 8% caloric restriction (OExCR). Values are means±SEM. (a) Indicates significant difference from YA group. (b) Indicates significant difference from OA group.Given that phosphorylation of HSP27 directly interact with death associated-protein 6 (Daxx), a mediator of Fas-mediated apoptotic pathways, which also mediate a caspase-independent cell death (Charette and others 2000b), we tested the hypotheses that aging would decrease HSP27 phosphorylation at Ser82, and mild caloric restriction and lifelong wheel running would increase phosphorylation of HSP27 at Ser82 (p-HSP27). We found that p-HSP27 significantly decreased with age by 49% when rats were fed ad libitum (p=0.037) (Figure 3B). Lifelong wheel running exercise with caloric restriction resulted in a substantial elevation of p-HSP27 by 254% (p<0.001), well above both the OAL and YAL groups. However, mild caloric restriction without wheel running did not increase p-HSP27 protein levels in the plantaris of old rats compared with the ad libitum group (Figure 3B). In contrast, HSP70 protein abundance was not different between the YAL and OAL groups (Figure 4A). No difference was found between old ad libitum and caloric restricted groups. In addition, lifelong exercise with caloric restriction had little effect on HSP70 protein levels as well. Heat shock factor-1 (HSF1) is a major upstream transcriptional molecule that exists bound to HSP70 and HSP90. We found no age-related differences in HSF-1 protein levels for OAL compared with YAL. Further, neither caloric restriction nor wheel running with caloric restriction had a significant effect on HSF-1 protein levels (Figure 4B). Furthermore, HSP90 also displayed no significant effect with age, caloric restriction, or wheel running exercise, similar to HSP70 (Figure 4C). Thus these data clearly demonstrated that HSP27 is a primary stress protein target by daily, voluntary running exercise combined with mild caloric restriction. Figure 4. Open in a new tab HSP70, HSF-1, and HSP90 protein levels in young (6 mo.) Fischer-344 rats fed ad libitum (YA), old (24 mo.) rats fed ad libitum (OA), old rats that underwent lifelong 8% caloric restriction (OCR), and old rats that participated in lifelong voluntary wheel running plus 8% caloric restriction (OExCR). Values are means±SEM. (a) Indicates significant difference from YA group. (b) Indicates significant difference from OA group.DISCUSSION The main objective of this study was to examine the effect of lifelong mild caloric restriction and voluntary wheel running exercise with caloric restriction on caspase-independent apoptosis. We also determined whether age-associated dysregulation of heat shock proteins is a potential protective mechanism against age-induced elevation of caspase-independent apoptotic signaling in skeletal muscle. A primary finding was that both lifelong mild caloric restriction and wheel running exercise with caloric restriction effectively abrogated age-induced translocation or accumulation of EndoG in the nucleus. This is highly novel data, suggesting that part of the amelioration of apoptosis by caloric restriction and long-term exercise demonstrated previously in the literature (Marzetti and others 2008b) is linked to prevention of nuclear EndoG accumulation in skeletal muscle nuclei. A secondary novel finding of our study indicates that caloric restriction and wheel running exercise over the lifespan with caloric restriction upregulated HSP27 protein levels, and caloric restriction with wheel running exercise increased phosphorylation of HSP27 at the Ser82 site. In contrast, wheel running exercise and mild caloric restriction demonstrated little positive effect on HSP70, HSF-1, and HSP90. To our knowledge, these are the first data to indicate that long-term exercise and mild caloric restriction protect against age-related elevation of caspase-independent apoptotic signaling. We suggest that phosphorylation of HSP27 may be an upstream mechanism of protection for lifelong exercise against apoptosis and sarcopenia, which afflict aging populations. In current study, we demonstrated that the caspase-independent apoptosis via EndoG signaling is responsive, but not via AIF signaling to aged skeletal muscle. Our results showed an age-induced increase in EndoG from nucleus but not from cytosol in skeletal muscles. The results are consistent with previous findings from Gouspillou et al. (Gouspillou and others 2014), Marzetti et al. (Marzetti and others 2008a; Marzetti and others 2008c), and Leeuwenburgh et al. (Leeuwenburgh and others 2005). Gouspillou and colleagues (Gouspillou and others 2014) reported that EndoG translocation to nucleus was significantly increased in physically active old human showing muscle atrophy. Marzetti and colleagues (Marzetti and others 2008a) have demonstrated no significant change in cytosolic levels of EndoG with age, but an age-associated upregulation of apoptotic cell death in skeletal muscle. Leeuwenburgh and Marzetti (Leeuwenburgh and others 2005; Marzetti and others 2008c) have shown an increased nuclear EndoG protein content and localization in F344BN rats began at 29–32 months of age. In that study nuclear EndoG protein levels in aging skeletal muscle were positively related with apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Our finding underlies that EndoG release from mitochondria initiates caspase-independent apoptotic process, but actual DNA fragmentation and cell death may take place only after EndoG translocate to the nucleus, regardless of their cytosolic levels (Danial and Korsmeyer 2004). Thus, the accumulation of EndoG in the nucleosome fraction in aged skeletal muscle may be a signature of caspase-independent signaling linked with age-associated DNA damage and subsequent muscle sarcopenia. Although some preclinical studies have also implicated caspase-independent EndoG translocation and apoptosis in aging skeletal muscle (Gouspillou and others 2014; Marzetti and others 2012), the physiological relevance of caspase-independent EndoG pathways associated with muscle mass/size/function and physical performance further need to be established. Recent study from Marzetti et al.,(Marzetti and others 2012) indicated no significant correlations between caspase-independent apoptotic signaling proteins and muscle mass or functional measures. Instead, they found a direct physiological association of caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways. Our previous study using the same model with current study showed that a myofiber atrophy (−27%) occurred with age (Kim and others 2008). However, we could not directly compare the caspase-independent EndoG pathways with muscle cell morphology, mitochondrial function and physical functions due to small sample size, tissue limitation, and the lack of the functional parameter data, which make our finding highly relevant. Therefore, further study will have to determine if caspase-independent apoptosis directly affect cellular function and physical performance. The amelioration of age-induced increase in caspase-independent apoptosis by mild caloric restriction and long-term voluntary exercise via EndoG, but not AIF, is not consistent with data from previous two studies. Dirks et al., (Dirks and Leeuwenburgh 2004) proposed that age-induced increase in total AIF protein contents in whole plantaris could be ameliorated by lifelong moderate (40%) caloric restriction. However, they also reported no age and caloric restriction effect on nuclear AIF protein content. In contrast, Marzetti and colleagues (Marzetti and others 2008c) demonstrated that both cytosolic and nuclear AIF protein contents were significantly increased with age in rat gastrocnemius. In our study, we found that AIF contents were not different with age, caloric restriction and even exercise with caloric restriction in both cytosolic and nucleosome fraction. The cause of this discrepancy is not clear but may involve labile protein and stability, difficulty in detection of AIF due to its rapid protein turnover (Dirks and Leeuwenburgh 2004), different experimental models (e.g., mild vs. moderate caloric restriction), or methodological differences among studies. Regardless, our study suggest a more robust effect of exercise and caloric restriction on EndoG, and thus EndoG pathways may play a more prominent role in protecting against apoptosis and muscle loss. Mild caloric restriction and exercise-induced decline in nucleus EndoG in aged skeletal muscle implies another potential protective downstream mechanism against sarcopenia. Indeed, Wohlgemuth and colleagues (Wohlgemuth and others 2010) reported that both mild caloric restriction and voluntary wheel running exercise with a similar protocol and muscle selected as current study reduced apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Our laboratory also previously demonstrated that mild caloric restriction and lifelong wheel running exercise with caloric restriction attenuate an age-related decrease in fiber cross-sectional area and increase in fibrosis from plantaris muscles (Kim and others 2008). Collectively, downregulation of EndoG may be linked to protection against apoptosis and myonuclei loss when exercise and caloric restriction interventions begin as young adults and cover a large percentage of lifespan. Further investigations of the protective effects of lifelong exercise or physical activity on EndoG signaling and apoptosis are warranted. The positive effects of mild caloric restriction and voluntary lifelong wheel running exercise with caloric restriction on EndoG in aging muscle are exciting, and suggest the potential for protective, regulatory upstream pathways, including chaperone proteins capable of inactivating apoptosis. Thus we sought to determine if potential upstream mediators of protection by mild caloric restriction and lifelong wheel running exercise with caloric restriction against apoptosis might include key heat shock proteins (HSPs). In current study, we found neither mild caloric restriction nor long-term exercise with caloric restriction in old group affected HSP70 protein levels. Huffman et al., (Huffman and others 2008) demonstrated that long-term (24-week) mild (either 9% or 18%) caloric restriction did not affect muscle HSP70. In contrast, higher levels (40%) of caloric restriction increased HSP70 protein levels in skeletal muscle (Selsby and others 2005). Thus, mild caloric restriction may not reach a threshold sufficient to stimulate HSP70 and stress response. It is also likely that the exercise intensity involved in wheel running in rats was insufficient in metabolic or heat stress to elevate or protect HSP70. Indeed, Milne et al., (Milne and Noble 2002) demonstrated that HSP70 response in skeletal muscle with exercise is intensity-dependent. The notion of wheel running in the F344 strain of rats as a low intensity exercise is consistent with a lack of response of citrate synthase activity in the plantaris muscle to lifelong wheel running in our previous study (Kim and others 2008). In addition, there might be an interaction or a non-specific response to other stressors in voluntary exercise compared with mandatory exercise environment. Noble et al., (Noble and others 2006) demonstrated that typical enforced treadmill exercise-induced hyperthermia as well as additional unavoidable stressors such as noise and animal handling can be potent activators of HSP70. Furthermore, caloric restriction and exercise had no impact on anti-apoptotic HSP90 and HSF-1, a transcriptional factor responsible for triggering the response to increase HSP70 level. Our data clearly indicate that HSP27 protein levels and phosphorylation are more responsive to 8% caloric restriction and voluntary wheel running exercise than HSP70, HSF-1, and HSP90. In addition, reduction in HSP27 protein levels with age and elevation with caloric restriction is consistent with the Selsby’s study (Selsby and others 2005). Our findings are novel as they are the first to demonstrate that voluntary wheel running exercise with lifelong mild caloric restriction elevated both HSP27 protein abundance and phosphorylation of HSP27 at its active Ser82 site. Thus it is possible that elevation of HSP27 and p-HSP27 with voluntary wheel running exercise with caloric restriction may provide cell protection against damage and inhibit apoptosis through a direct inhibition of caspase-independent or caspase-dependent signal transduction (Whitlock and others 2005). In addition, elevated HSP27 can help stabilize actin-cytoskeleton and linkages between muscle fibers and surrounding connective tissue, in proximity with myonuclei (Koh and Escobedo 2004; Landry and Huot 1999). Furthermore, we previously showed that light activity, such as ambulation, stimulates phosphorylation of HSP27 during the early stages of recovery from disuse (Lawler and others 2012). This warrants further investigation to test HSP27 as an important mediator of myocyte integrity and function in skeletal muscles in response to long-term exercise and caloric restriction. The underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms by which HSP27 could interfere with caspase-independent apoptotic signaling remain unknown. However, HSP27 may interact with the release of EndoG and/or AIF proteins from the mitochondria, much as HSP27 prevents cytochrome-c/dATP-mediated interaction of apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) with caspase-dependent apoptosis (Whitlock and others 2005). In addtion, the phosphorylation of HSP27 can directly interact with the Daxx, a mediator of Fas-induced apoptosis, which connect with the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1), which mediates caspase-independent apoptosis (Charette and others 2000a). In short, our findings suggest that mild caloric restriction and lifelong voluntary exercise with mild caloric restriction may attenuate muscle apoptosis in caspase-independent manner through EndoG signaling, and HSP27 upregulation and phosphorylation as a prime upstream candidate of caloric restriction- and exercise-induced protection. These data are therefore stimulus for further investigation which 1) examined the role of HSP27 in mediating EndoG-activated apoptosis or cell death by using HSP27 over-expressed or deficient cells and animals; and 2) examined the effects on muscle atrophy, cellular function, and physical performance.Highlights. EndoG levels in nucleosome fraction are higher in old rats than in young rats. Both caloric restriction and exercise attenuate age-induced nucleic EndoG levels. HSP27 and p-HSP27 at Ser82 are protected by exercise as upstream targets that suppress EndoG levels.
