    "abstract": "Abstract The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO2-enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus Carnobacterium, most closely related to C. inhibens (five isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of Carnobacterium (C. alterfunditum, C. divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. maltaromaticum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans) were all capable of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the low-pressure extreme at which life can function.

    "methods": "Materials and Methods Permafrost Samples. Permafrost samples with a mean annual temperature of −7 °C were taken in the forest-tundra zone of northeastern Siberia (68.633°N, 159.079°E, the right bank of the Kolyma River) (Fig. 1) using a dry drilling rig that operates without fluids and prevents down-hole contamination (20). Four frozen soil samples, 4, 5, 8, and 9, were collected from the depths of 12.7, 16.5, 20.1, and 21.8 m below the surface, respectively. The strict protocols for drilling and the subsequent handling of cores were designed to ensure that uncontaminated material was retrieved (20). After removal from the corer, the surfaces of the cores (68- to 107-mm diameter) were cleaned by shaving off the outer layers with an alcohol-sterilized knife. For microbiological studies the cores were split into 5-cm-long segments, placed into sterile plastic bags, stored frozen in the field within a hole excavated in the permafrost, transported frozen to the Soil Cryology Laboratory in Pushchino, Russia, and then transported frozen by air to Kennedy Space Center, FL. The samples represent epigenetically frozen layers of Holocene age (6–8 kyBP) formed by refreezing of sediments that had melted and drained. They are hydrocarbonate-calcium fine-grained peaty sandy-loams, firmly bound by ice (ice content 25–37%), with pH close to neutral (6.8–7.2) and containing organic carbon (0.5–2.0%). Microbiological Techniques. Medium used throughout was TSBYS medium containing (per L): trypticase soy broth, 30 g; yeast extract, 3 g; NaCl, 13 g; KCl, 0.34 g; MgCl2 × 6H2O, 4 g; MgSO4 × 7 H2O, 3.45 g; NH4Cl, 0.25 g; CaCl2 × 2H2O, 0.14 g. For plates, TSBYS was solidified with agar (15 g/L). Permafrost samples (0.9–1.4 g) were diluted serially 10-fold in double-distilled water, plated on TSBYS agar, and incubated at room temperature (ca. 23 °C) for times ranging from 1 to 30 d. Colonies arising were either replica-plated or picked onto fresh TSBYS plates in 100-colony grid patterns and exposed to environmental simulations (example in Fig. 2). Each colony able to grow under simulated Mars conditions was picked, streak-purified, grown overnight in TSBYS liquid medium, and stored as a frozen glycerol stock at −70 °C. Carnobacterium type strains were obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ)-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (www.dsmz.de). All strains used are listed in Table 2. Low-PTA Simulations. The hypobaric system used for attaining low-PTA conditions has been described in detail (7). In brief, a 4-L polystyrene desiccator was placed in a low-temperature incubator set at 0 °C and connected to a low-pressure controller and vacuum pump (model PU-842; KNF Neuberger). Inoculated TSBYS plates were inserted into the desiccator, agar surface upward (i.e., not inverted). Six anaerobic pouches (model R681001 AnaeroPacks, Remel, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were placed inside with the vertically stacked plates. The system was then flushed with ultra-high-purity CO2 and the desiccator sealed; this constituted anoxic atmosphere. The pressure inside the desiccator was either left at Earth-normal level (1,013 mbar) or pumped down to 7 mbar, the global average Mars surface pressure (5). At 7-d intervals the hypobaric chamber was vented to laboratory atmosphere, samples removed for assay, the anaerobic pouches replaced, and the system returned to test conditions. The anaerobic pouches have been shown to reduce the O2 concentration to <0.1% within 1 h (21). All plates were maintained for up to 30 d at 0 °C. Quantitative Growth Assays. Two microliters of a fresh overnight culture made in liquid TSBYS (containing from 5 × 104 to 5 × 106 cells) were spotted in triplicate onto TSBYS plates and incubated under low-PTA conditions. At weekly intervals, agar blocks containing the cell spots were cut out of the plates with a sterile scalpel and placed individually into 1 mL of sterile PBS (10 mM potassium phosphate and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Cells were suspended by vortexing, diluted serially 10-fold, and plated for viable cells on TSBYS plates incubated at room temperature. Numbers of generations (n) were calculated using the equation where N1 and N2 are the number of cells per spot at 0 and 4 wk, respectively (22). Molecular Taxonomy of Strains by 16S rDNA Analysis. Chromosomal DNA was purified and 16S rDNAs were amplified and sequenced as described previously (23). 16S rDNA sequences were used to query the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database (24) (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). The phylogenetic tree was built with the RDP Tree Builder using the Weighbor weighted neighbor-joining tree-building algorithm. All 16S rDNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers denoted in Fig. 3.",

Samples of permafrost obtained from the Siberian arctic (Fig. 1) were suspended and plated on trypticase soy broth yeast extract salt (TSBYS) medium and incubated at room temperature (ca. 23 °C) for up to 28 d. Colonies were either picked or replica-plated onto fresh TSBYS plates and incubated for 30 d under low-PTA conditions. Out of a total of ∼9.3 × 103 colonies tested from four different permafrost soil samples, 6 colonies were observed to grow under low-PTA conditions (Table 1). Five isolates, (strains WN1359 and WN1370–WN1373) were obtained from permafrost soil sample 4, and a single isolate (strain WN1374) was obtained from soil sample 9 (Table 1). Fig. 1.

Growth of Permafrost Isolates Under Low-PTA Conditions. To further understand the effects of temperature, atmospheric composition, and pressure on permafrost isolates, the following experiment was performed, depicted in Fig. 2. One hundred isolates from permafrost samples 4, 5, 8, and 9 were picked onto triplicate TSBYS plates. All plates were incubated at 0 °C for 30 d under different combinations of atmosphere and pressure. The TSBYS plate incubated at Earth atmospheric composition and pressure (i.e., low-T conditions) showed luxuriant colony development with a variety of different colony morphotypes, including distinctive orange colonies (Fig. 2A). On the replicate TSBYS plate incubated under anoxic atmosphere but Earth-normal pressure of 1,013 mbar (i.e., low-TA conditions) only one colony, number 43, was able to grow (Fig. 2B). This same colony was also able to grow at 7 mbar pressure under full low-PTA conditions (Fig. 2C); in fact, it seemed that colony 43 actually grew best under low-PTA conditions (compare in Fig. 2 panels A, B, and C). Isolate 43 was streak-purified and designated strain WN1359. Despite the fact that growth of the other 99 colonies was severely inhibited by 30 d of exposure to low-PTA conditions, all colonies recovered and grew rapidly (within 24 h) upon return to laboratory benchtop conditions (Fig. 2D). This result is in good agreement with previous observations that growth inhibition of microbes caused by exposure to low pressure is apparently nonlethal and rapidly reversible (7, 10). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Growth of 100 isolates from Siberian permafrost samples on TSBYS plates. Isolates are from permafrost sample 5 (colonies 1–25), 4 (colonies 26–50), 8 (colonies 51–75), and 9 (colonies 76–100). (A–C) All isolates were cultivated for 30 d at 0 °C under the following conditions: (A) Earth atmosphere and pressure. (B) Simulated Mars atmosphere, Earth pressure. (C) Simulated Mars atmosphere and pressure. Colony 43 from permafrost sample 4 was designated strain WN1359. (D) Same plate as in C, but after 1 additional day of incubation on the laboratory bench (i.e., at room temperature, Earth atmospheric composition and pressure). Identification of Permafrost Isolates as Carnobacterium spp. The 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences were determined for all six isolates that could grow under low-PTA conditions (Table 1) and were compared with the16S rDNA database in the Ribosomal Database Project (Fig. 3). All five isolates from permafrost sample 4 were found to be most closely related to Carnobacterium inhibens type strain DSM13024T, with the following % identities: WN1359 (94.9%), WN1370 (95.7%), WN1371 (95.9%), WN1372 (96.4%), and WN1373 (96.6%). The sole isolate from permafrost sample 9, strain WN1374, was found to be most closely related to Carnobacterium viridans type strain DSM14451T (96.7%). Using the molecular criteria that bacterial species and genera demonstrate >97% and >95% 16S rDNA sequence identity, respectively (11, 12), the permafrost isolates likely represent unique species of the genus Carnobacterium; however, definitive designation of species status must await more rigorous taxonomic characterization (13). It is quite interesting to note that the 16S rDNA sequences from all five Carnobacterium spp. isolates obtained from permafrost sample 4 were found to be >97% identical to Carnobacterium sp. strain LV62:W1 isolated from Lake Vanda, Antarctica (GenBank accession no. AF076637) (14). Furthermore, 16S rDNA from the single strain isolated from permafrost sample 9 was >97% identical to that of Carnobacterium sp. strain ARCTIC-P35 (GenBank accession no. AY573048 (15). Thus, all of the permafrost isolates obtained in this study were most closely related to other Carnobacterium spp. isolated from Arctic and Antarctic environments. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree depicting the relatedness of permafrost isolates (gray boxes) to Carnobacterium type strains. The tree was constructed using the Tree Builder program on the Ribosomal Database Project server, using Desemzia incerta as the outgroup. Numbers to the right of strain names are the GenBank accession numbers of the corresponding 16S rDNA sequences.Several of the distinctive orange colonies (Fig. 2) were also characterized by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as most closely related to the Gram-positive psychrophile Exiguobacterium sibiricum strain 7-3, which was previously reported to have been isolated from permafrost samples obtained from the Kolyma region by one of the authors (D.G.) (16). Although these isolates were unable to grow under low-PTA conditions (Fig. 2), this observation lent greater confidence that the Carnobacterium spp. isolates described here indeed originated from permafrost and were not contaminants. Growth Kinetics of Permafrost Isolates and Carnobacterium Type Species Under Low-PTA Conditions. At present, the genus Carnobacterium consists of ten recognized species: C. alterfunditum, C. divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. jeotgali, C. maltaromaticum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans. All Carnobacterium species to date are capable of growing at low temperatures and have been isolated from a wide variety of environments, including the Arctic and Antarctic (Table 2). This observation prompted us to quantify the growth kinetics under low-PTA conditions of both the permafrost isolates and nine type species of Carnobacterium. A typical experiment performed on triplicate samples of permafrost strain WN1359 (Fig. 4) showed that strain WN1359 grew better under low-TA conditions (triangles) than low-T conditions (circles), and grew best under low-PTA conditions (squares).

Data are averages and SDs of triplicate determinations.The same experiment depicted for strain WN1359 in Fig. 4 was also conducted on all six permafrost isolates (Fig. 5A) and nine Carnobacterium spp. type strains (Fig. 5B); to conserve space, the data were converted to number of generations each strain grew over the 28-d course of the experiment (Materials and Methods). All bacteria were capable of growth under low-PTA conditions, but several distinct patterns of growth under different environmental conditions emerged (Fig. 5). For convenience, the growth pattern observed by strain WN1359 is designated here as abc, following its statistical grouping (Fig. 5A). In other words, growth followed the pattern low-PTA > low-TA > low-T (Fig. 5A). In addition to strain WN1359, strains WN1370, WN1373, C. mobile, and C. inhibens also exhibited the abc pattern of growth (Fig. 5). Other growth patterns were also discernible. For example, several bacteria demonstrated an abb growth pattern (i.e., their growth followed the pattern low-TA = low-PTA > low-T). These strains included permafrost strain WN1374, C. gallinarum, C. viridans, C. divergens, C. funditum, and C. alterfunditum. Strains WN1372 and C. pleistocenium exhibited an aab growth pattern, in which they only grew better under low-PTA conditions (Fig. 5). Finally, strains WN1371 and C. maltaromaticum exhibited an aaa growth pattern in which no statistical difference in growth was detected under the three conditions tested. For comparative purposes, the same experiment was performed on S. liquefaciens strain ATCC7529, also recently shown to grow at 7 mbar, which exhibited an aaa type growth pattern. Fig. 5.

Conclusions. From this work it can be seen that microbial communities from Siberian permafrost contain organisms capable of growing under conditions of low temperature, low pressure, and anoxic CO2-dominated atmosphere. It should be stressed, however, that low-PTA conditions are only a subset of the total potentially biotoxic physical factors constraining the survival or growth of terrestrial microbes on Mars, such as solar UV, extreme desiccation, solar particle events, and galactic cosmic rays. In addition, the martian regolith itself contains numerous potentially biotoxic factors, such as salinity, pH, and Eh of available liquid water; oxidizing soils created by UV-induced processes and soil chemical reactions; or the presence of heavy metals (discussed extensively in refs. 7 and 17). Not all of the tested permafrost soil samples yielded isolates, perhaps because the initial incubations were performed at room temperature (ca. 23 °C), which would inhibit the growth of strict psychrophiles; however, all isolates obtained from this set of experiments belonged to the genus Carnobacterium. As its name suggests, the first isolates of the genus were obtained as putative spoilage organisms of meat products. In this regard it is interesting to note that three species, C. gallinarum, C. viridans, and C. divergens, were all isolated from refrigerated vacuum-packed meats (Table 2), suggesting the ability of these microbes to grow under cold, low-pressure conditions. Several Carnobacterium spp. have also been isolated from permanently cold environments (C. alterfunditum, C. funditum), including arctic permafrost (C. pleistocenium) (Table 2). The extreme age of the Siberian permafrost isolates reported here (∼6,000–8,000 y) and the Alaskan permafrost isolate C. pleistocenium (∼32,000 y) (18) indicates that these species are capable of long periods of survival in permanently frozen environments. Terrestrial life has evolved mechanisms to tolerate and indeed flourish in extreme high-pressure habitats such as the deep ocean (19), but very little is understood regarding microbial responses to low pressure, a physical constraint not found in nature on the Earth’s surface. The discovery of terrestrial bacteria that can inhabit cold, low-pressure, anoxic environments has implications for the fields of extremophile biology, astrobiology, the search for extraterrestrial life, and planetary protection. Permafrosts seem to be promising locations for the isolation of microbes capable of growth under cold, anoxic, and hypobaric conditions such as are encountered on Mars. It is anticipated that further sampling of permafrost from other locations or depths will yield additional microbes exhibiting this unique set of properties.",

Strains WN1372 and C. pleistocenium exhibited an aab growth pattern, in which they only grew better under low-PTA conditions (Fig. 5). Finally, strains WN1371 and C. maltaromaticum exhibited an aaa growth pattern in which no statistical difference in growth was detected under the three conditions tested. For comparative purposes, the same experiment was performed on S. liquefaciens strain ATCC7529, also recently shown to grow at 7 mbar, which exhibited an aaa type growth pattern. Fig. 5.

Conclusions. From this work it can be seen that microbial communities from Siberian permafrost contain organisms capable of growing under conditions of low temperature, low pressure, and anoxic CO2-dominated atmosphere. It should be stressed, however, that low-PTA conditions are only a subset of the total potentially biotoxic physical factors constraining the survival or growth of terrestrial microbes on Mars, such as solar UV, extreme desiccation, solar particle events, and galactic cosmic rays. In addition, the martian regolith itself contains numerous potentially biotoxic factors, such as salinity, pH, and Eh of available liquid water; oxidizing soils created by UV-induced processes and soil chemical reactions; or the presence of heavy metals (discussed extensively in refs. 7 and 17). Not all of the tested permafrost soil samples yielded isolates, perhaps because the initial incubations were performed at room temperature (ca. 23 °C), which would inhibit the growth of strict psychrophiles; however, all isolates obtained from this set of experiments belonged to the genus Carnobacterium. As its name suggests, the first isolates of the genus were obtained as putative spoilage organisms of meat products. In this regard it is interesting to note that three species, C. gallinarum, C. viridans, and C. divergens, were all isolated from refrigerated vacuum-packed meats (Table 2), suggesting the ability of these microbes to grow under cold, low-pressure conditions. Several Carnobacterium spp. have also been isolated from permanently cold environments (C. alterfunditum, C. funditum), including arctic permafrost (C. pleistocenium) (Table 2). The extreme age of the Siberian permafrost isolates reported here (∼6,000–8,000 y) and the Alaskan permafrost isolate C. pleistocenium (∼32,000 y) (18) indicates that these species are capable of long periods of survival in permanently frozen environments. Terrestrial life has evolved mechanisms to tolerate and indeed flourish in extreme high-pressure habitats such as the deep ocean (19), but very little is understood regarding microbial responses to low pressure, a physical constraint not found in nature on the Earth’s surface. The discovery of terrestrial bacteria that can inhabit cold, low-pressure, anoxic environments has implications for the fields of extremophile biology, astrobiology, the search for extraterrestrial life, and planetary protection. Permafrosts seem to be promising locations for the isolation of microbes capable of growth under cold, anoxic, and hypobaric conditions such as are encountered on Mars. It is anticipated that further sampling of permafrost from other locations or depths will yield additional microbes exhibiting this unique set of properties.",

Series information From the CoverIssue date 2013 Jan 8.  Copyright notice ID: 3545801 PMID: 23267097 Abstract The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO2-enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus Carnobacterium, most closely related to C. inhibens (five isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of Carnobacterium (C. alterfunditum, C. divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. maltaromaticum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans) were all capable of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the low-pressure extreme at which life can function. Keywords: astrobiology, planetary protection A central goal of astrobiology is to explore the limits at which life can occur and to search for life and habitable locations outside Earth (1). The planet Mars is considered a promising astrobiological exploration target owing to its relative proximity and similarity to Earth, coupled with increasing evidence pointing to the past and present existence of liquid water at the surface and near subsurface (2–4). The current surface environment of Mars presents formidable challenges to life, such as a scarcity of liquid water and organic nutrients, extreme low temperatures, a low-pressure CO2-dominated atmosphere, harsh solar and galactic cosmic radiation, and a lack of organic nutrients (5). To address the question of whether terrestrial life could survive and grow in the martian environment, several researchers have turned to Mars environmental simulations conducted in chambers that replicate the temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition, regolith composition, and solar radiation environment of the Mars surface and near subsurface (6). Results from past experiments testing the ability of dozens of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in one such simulator demonstrated that the combination of low pressure (P; 7 mbar), low temperature (T; 0 °C), and anoxic atmosphere (A), called here low-PTA conditions, posed significant barriers to growth (5, 7, 8). Because much of the water on present-day Mars exists in a permanently frozen state mixed with mineral matrix, permafrosts on Earth are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian environment (9). On the basis of similarities between martian regolith and terrestrial permafrost, we reasoned that permafrost might contain microbes capable of growth under low-PTA conditions. In this communication we report that screening of ca. 10,000 microbes obtained from four Siberian permafrost samples resulted in the isolation of six bacterial strains capable of growth under low-PTA conditions, and that all of these isolates belonged to the Gram-positive genus Carnobacterium. Results and Discussion Isolation of Microorganisms from Siberian Permafrost. Samples of permafrost obtained from the Siberian arctic (Fig. 1) were suspended and plated on trypticase soy broth yeast extract salt (TSBYS) medium and incubated at room temperature (ca. 23 °C) for up to 28 d. Colonies were either picked or replica-plated onto fresh TSBYS plates and incubated for 30 d under low-PTA conditions. Out of a total of ∼9.3 × 103 colonies tested from four different permafrost soil samples, 6 colonies were observed to grow under low-PTA conditions (Table 1). Five isolates, (strains WN1359 and WN1370–WN1373) were obtained from permafrost soil sample 4, and a single isolate (strain WN1374) was obtained from soil sample 9 (Table 1). Fig. 1.

To further understand the effects of temperature, atmospheric composition, and pressure on permafrost isolates, the following experiment was performed, depicted in Fig. 2. One hundred isolates from permafrost samples 4, 5, 8, and 9 were picked onto triplicate TSBYS plates. All plates were incubated at 0 °C for 30 d under different combinations of atmosphere and pressure. The TSBYS plate incubated at Earth atmospheric composition and pressure (i.e., low-T conditions) showed luxuriant colony development with a variety of different colony morphotypes, including distinctive orange colonies (Fig. 2A). On the replicate TSBYS plate incubated under anoxic atmosphere but Earth-normal pressure of 1,013 mbar (i.e., low-TA conditions) only one colony, number 43, was able to grow (Fig. 2B). This same colony was also able to grow at 7 mbar pressure under full low-PTA conditions (Fig. 2C); in fact, it seemed that colony 43 actually grew best under low-PTA conditions (compare in Fig. 2 panels A, B, and C). Isolate 43 was streak-purified and designated strain WN1359. Despite the fact that growth of the other 99 colonies was severely inhibited by 30 d of exposure to low-PTA conditions, all colonies recovered and grew rapidly (within 24 h) upon return to laboratory benchtop conditions (Fig. 2D). This result is in good agreement with previous observations that growth inhibition of microbes caused by exposure to low pressure is apparently nonlethal and rapidly reversible (7, 10). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Growth of 100 isolates from Siberian permafrost samples on TSBYS plates. Isolates are from permafrost sample 5 (colonies 1–25), 4 (colonies 26–50), 8 (colonies 51–75), and 9 (colonies 76–100). (A–C) All isolates were cultivated for 30 d at 0 °C under the following conditions: (A) Earth atmosphere and pressure. (B) Simulated Mars atmosphere, Earth pressure. (C) Simulated Mars atmosphere and pressure. Colony 43 from permafrost sample 4 was designated strain WN1359. (D) Same plate as in C, but after 1 additional day of incubation on the laboratory bench (i.e., at room temperature, Earth atmospheric composition and pressure).Identification of Permafrost Isolates as Carnobacterium spp. The 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences were determined for all six isolates that could grow under low-PTA conditions (Table 1) and were compared with the16S rDNA database in the Ribosomal Database Project (Fig. 3). All five isolates from permafrost sample 4 were found to be most closely related to Carnobacterium inhibens type strain DSM13024T, with the following % identities: WN1359 (94.9%), WN1370 (95.7%), WN1371 (95.9%), WN1372 (96.4%), and WN1373 (96.6%). The sole isolate from permafrost sample 9, strain WN1374, was found to be most closely related to Carnobacterium viridans type strain DSM14451T (96.7%). Using the molecular criteria that bacterial species and genera demonstrate >97% and >95% 16S rDNA sequence identity, respectively (11, 12), the permafrost isolates likely represent unique species of the genus Carnobacterium; however, definitive designation of species status must await more rigorous taxonomic characterization (13). It is quite interesting to note that the 16S rDNA sequences from all five Carnobacterium spp. isolates obtained from permafrost sample 4 were found to be >97% identical to Carnobacterium sp. strain LV62:W1 isolated from Lake Vanda, Antarctica (GenBank accession no. AF076637) (14). Furthermore, 16S rDNA from the single strain isolated from permafrost sample 9 was >97% identical to that of Carnobacterium sp. strain ARCTIC-P35 (GenBank accession no. AY573048 (15). Thus, all of the permafrost isolates obtained in this study were most closely related to other Carnobacterium spp. isolated from Arctic and Antarctic environments. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree depicting the relatedness of permafrost isolates (gray boxes) to Carnobacterium type strains. The tree was constructed using the Tree Builder program on the Ribosomal Database Project server, using Desemzia incerta as the outgroup. Numbers to the right of strain names are the GenBank accession numbers of the corresponding 16S rDNA sequences.Several of the distinctive orange colonies (Fig. 2) were also characterized by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as most closely related to the Gram-positive psychrophile Exiguobacterium sibiricum strain 7-3, which was previously reported to have been isolated from permafrost samples obtained from the Kolyma region by one of the authors (D.G.) (16). Although these isolates were unable to grow under low-PTA conditions (Fig. 2), this observation lent greater confidence that the Carnobacterium spp. isolates described here indeed originated from permafrost and were not contaminants.Growth Kinetics of Permafrost Isolates and Carnobacterium Type Species Under Low-PTA Conditions. At present, the genus Carnobacterium consists of ten recognized species: C. alterfunditum, C. divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. jeotgali, C. maltaromaticum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans. All Carnobacterium species to date are capable of growing at low temperatures and have been isolated from a wide variety of environments, including the Arctic and Antarctic (Table 2). This observation prompted us to quantify the growth kinetics under low-PTA conditions of both the permafrost isolates and nine type species of Carnobacterium. A typical experiment performed on triplicate samples of permafrost strain WN1359 (Fig. 4) showed that strain WN1359 grew better under low-TA conditions (triangles) than low-T conditions (circles), and grew best under low-PTA conditions (squares).

Data are averages and SDs of triplicate determinations.The same experiment depicted for strain WN1359 in Fig. 4 was also conducted on all six permafrost isolates (Fig. 5A) and nine Carnobacterium spp. type strains (Fig. 5B); to conserve space, the data were converted to number of generations each strain grew over the 28-d course of the experiment (Materials and Methods). All bacteria were capable of growth under low-PTA conditions, but several distinct patterns of growth under different environmental conditions emerged (Fig. 5). For convenience, the growth pattern observed by strain WN1359 is designated here as abc, following its statistical grouping (Fig. 5A). In other words, growth followed the pattern low-PTA > low-TA > low-T (Fig. 5A). In addition to strain WN1359, strains WN1370, WN1373, C. mobile, and C. inhibens also exhibited the abc pattern of growth (Fig. 5). Other growth patterns were also discernible. For example, several bacteria demonstrated an abb growth pattern (i.e., their growth followed the pattern low-TA = low-PTA > low-T). These strains included permafrost strain WN1374, C. gallinarum, C. viridans, C. divergens, C. funditum, and C. alterfunditum. Strains WN1372 and C. pleistocenium exhibited an aab growth pattern, in which they only grew better under low-PTA conditions (Fig. 5). Finally, strains WN1371 and C. maltaromaticum exhibited an aaa growth pattern in which no statistical difference in growth was detected under the three conditions tested. For comparative purposes, the same experiment was performed on S. liquefaciens strain ATCC7529, also recently shown to grow at 7 mbar, which exhibited an aaa type growth pattern. Fig. 5.

Several Carnobacterium spp. have also been isolated from permanently cold environments (C. alterfunditum, C. funditum), including arctic permafrost (C. pleistocenium) (Table 2). The extreme age of the Siberian permafrost isolates reported here (∼6,000–8,000 y) and the Alaskan permafrost isolate C. pleistocenium (∼32,000 y) (18) indicates that these species are capable of long periods of survival in permanently frozen environments.

Permafrosts seem to be promising locations for the isolation of microbes capable of growth under cold, anoxic, and hypobaric conditions such as are encountered on Mars. It is anticipated that further sampling of permafrost from other locations or depths will yield additional microbes exhibiting this unique set of properties.Materials and Methods Permafrost Samples. Permafrost samples with a mean annual temperature of −7 °C were taken in the forest-tundra zone of northeastern Siberia (68.633°N, 159.079°E, the right bank of the Kolyma River) (Fig. 1) using a dry drilling rig that operates without fluids and prevents down-hole contamination (20). Four frozen soil samples, 4, 5, 8, and 9, were collected from the depths of 12.7, 16.5, 20.1, and 21.8 m below the surface, respectively. The strict protocols for drilling and the subsequent handling of cores were designed to ensure that uncontaminated material was retrieved (20). After removal from the corer, the surfaces of the cores (68- to 107-mm diameter) were cleaned by shaving off the outer layers with an alcohol-sterilized knife. For microbiological studies the cores were split into 5-cm-long segments, placed into sterile plastic bags, stored frozen in the field within a hole excavated in the permafrost, transported frozen to the Soil Cryology Laboratory in Pushchino, Russia, and then transported frozen by air to Kennedy Space Center, FL. The samples represent epigenetically frozen layers of Holocene age (6–8 kyBP) formed by refreezing of sediments that had melted and drained. They are hydrocarbonate-calcium fine-grained peaty sandy-loams, firmly bound by ice (ice content 25–37%), with pH close to neutral (6.8–7.2) and containing organic carbon (0.5–2.0%).Microbiological Techniques. Medium used throughout was TSBYS medium containing (per L): trypticase soy broth, 30 g; yeast extract, 3 g; NaCl, 13 g; KCl, 0.34 g; MgCl2 × 6H2O, 4 g; MgSO4 × 7 H2O, 3.45 g; NH4Cl, 0.25 g; CaCl2 × 2H2O, 0.14 g. For plates, TSBYS was solidified with agar (15 g/L). Permafrost samples (0.9–1.4 g) were diluted serially 10-fold in double-distilled water, plated on TSBYS agar, and incubated at room temperature (ca. 23 °C) for times ranging from 1 to 30 d. Colonies arising were either replica-plated or picked onto fresh TSBYS plates in 100-colony grid patterns and exposed to environmental simulations (example in Fig. 2). Each colony able to grow under simulated Mars conditions was picked, streak-purified, grown overnight in TSBYS liquid medium, and stored as a frozen glycerol stock at −70 °C. Carnobacterium type strains were obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ)-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (www.dsmz.de). All strains used are listed in Table 2.Low-PTA Simulations. The hypobaric system used for attaining low-PTA conditions has been described in detail (7). In brief, a 4-L polystyrene desiccator was placed in a low-temperature incubator set at 0 °C and connected to a low-pressure controller and vacuum pump (model PU-842; KNF Neuberger). Inoculated TSBYS plates were inserted into the desiccator, agar surface upward (i.e., not inverted). Six anaerobic pouches (model R681001 AnaeroPacks, Remel, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were placed inside with the vertically stacked plates. The system was then flushed with ultra-high-purity CO2 and the desiccator sealed; this constituted anoxic atmosphere. The pressure inside the desiccator was either left at Earth-normal level (1,013 mbar) or pumped down to 7 mbar, the global average Mars surface pressure (5). At 7-d intervals the hypobaric chamber was vented to laboratory atmosphere, samples removed for assay, the anaerobic pouches replaced, and the system returned to test conditions. The anaerobic pouches have been shown to reduce the O2 concentration to <0.1% within 1 h (21). All plates were maintained for up to 30 d at 0 °C.Quantitative Growth Assays. Two microliters of a fresh overnight culture made in liquid TSBYS (containing from 5 × 104 to 5 × 106 cells) were spotted in triplicate onto TSBYS plates and incubated under low-PTA conditions. At weekly intervals, agar blocks containing the cell spots were cut out of the plates with a sterile scalpel and placed individually into 1 mL of sterile PBS (10 mM potassium phosphate and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Cells were suspended by vortexing, diluted serially 10-fold, and plated for viable cells on TSBYS plates incubated at room temperature. Numbers of generations (n) were calculated using the equation where N1 and N2 are the number of cells per spot at 0 and 4 wk, respectively (22).Molecular Taxonomy of Strains by 16S rDNA Analysis. Chromosomal DNA was purified and 16S rDNAs were amplified and sequenced as described previously (23). 16S rDNA sequences were used to query the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database (24) (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). The phylogenetic tree was built with the RDP Tree Builder using the Weighbor weighted neighbor-joining tree-building algorithm. All 16S rDNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers denoted in Fig. 3.Acknowledgments We thank Krystal Kerney, Rafael Rodrigues de Oliveira, Samantha Waters, and Vasiliy Mironov for excellent technical assistance and the three reviewers for their insightful comments.

Copyright notice ID: 3869332 PMID: 24285647 Abstract We report the complete genome sequence of Carnobacterium gilichinskyi strain WN1359, previously isolated from Siberian permafrost and capable of growth under cold (0°C), anoxic, CO2-dominated, low-pressure (0.7-kPa) conditions in a simulation of the Mars atmosphere.GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Recently it was reported that Carnobacterium sp. strain WN1359, isolated from Siberian permafrost, was capable of growth under a combination of low-temperature (0°C), low-pressure (0.7-kPa), and CO2-enriched anoxic conditions intended to simulate the atmosphere of Mars (1). Based upon cladistic and phenetic analyses, the name C. gilichinskyi sp. nov. was proposed, with strain WN1359 being the type strain (W. L. Nicholson, K. Zhalnina, R. R. Oliveira, and E. W. Triplett, submitted for publication). As part of an effort to further investigate the molecular basis of the response of this organism to simulated Martian conditions, we report here the complete genome sequence of the strain. C. gilichinskyi strain WN1359 is from the corresponding author’s strain collection and is deposited as strain DSM 27470T in the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) (http://www.dsmz.de). Its genome was sequenced at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR) using the PacBio SMRT system (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA). A total of 78,692 reads were obtained, with a mean read length of 3,850 bp. The initial PacBio reads were error corrected using the PacBio RS_PreAssembler.1 module with minimum subread length of 500 bp, minimum read quality of 0.80, and minimum seed read length of 6,000 bp. The error correction process yielded 10,736 reads with an average length of 6,421 bp. A single scaffold was assembled directly from the error-corrected reads using Celera assembler (CA) version 7.0 software. The initial genome assembly was further refined using the PacBio RS_Resequencing.1 module with Quiver consensus calling. This process removes sequencing errors remaining in the initial CA assembly and produces the final consensus genome sequence. The chromosome has 2,347,813 bp and an overall GC content of 35.26%. We detected the presence of five plasmids in the genome, consisting of 9,615 bp (designated pWNCR9), 12,656 bp (pWNCR12), 15,476 bp (pWNCR15), 47,068 bp (pWNCR47), and 64,492 bp (pWNCR64). Open reading frame (ORF) prediction and annotation were performed through the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) pipeline (2) using GLIMMER (3). Of the 2,152 protein-encoding ORFs present in the circular chromosome, 1,697 (79%) were assigned by similarity to a known annotated protein function, while 455 (21%) were assigned to unknown protein functions. In addition, 1,841 ORFs (86%) were assigned to Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) categories (4) through the Batch Web CD-Search tool (5). The rRNAs and tRNAs were identified using the “search_for_RNAs” script developed by Niels Larsen (2) and tRNAscan-SE (6), respectively. By these analyses, 74 tRNAs and 8 rRNA operons, comprising 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA genes, were detected in the genome. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The results of this whole-genome shotgun project have been deposited with GenBank under accession numbers CP006812 (chromosome) and CP006813, CP006814, CP006815, CP006816, and CP006817 (plasmids).ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by a grant from the NASA Astrobiology: Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology program (NNX08AO15G) to W.L.N. and by award number S10RR027416 from the National Center for Research Resources to W.G.F.Footnotes Citation Leonard MT, Panayotova N, Farmerie WG, Triplett EW, Nicholson WL. 2013.

Measuring transcriptome changes resulting from exposure of bacterial cells to LP reveals insights into cellular processes that may respond to LP exposure.INTRODUCTION On Earth, there are a number of harsh environments that challenge microbial life due to extremes of fundamental physical factors, such as temperature, pressure, pH, or osmolarity. It is thus of prime importance to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that enable microbes to grow and, indeed, to flourish at such physical extremes. Pressure is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter that affects biological processes and conditions at nearly every level, such as protein folding, the hydration state of molecules, enzyme reaction kinetics, membrane fluidity, and protein-nucleic acid binding affinity, to name but a few (1, 2). High-pressure (HP) environments, ranging from those at sea level (∼101 kPa) to those at the depths of the Mariana Trench (∼100 MPa), are widespread beneath the world's oceans (i.e., the piezosphere). In contrast, hypobaric (i.e., low-pressure [LP]) environments are scarcely represented on Earth; nearly all surface life is located at the bottom of the troposphere, where the lowest terrestrial barometric pressure, at the top of Mt. Everest, is ∼34 kPa. However, recent reports of microbial metabolic processes occurring at high altitudes within clouds (3, 4) are beginning to challenge this paradigm. Despite a lack of natural LP environments on the Earth's surface, knowledge of the microbiology of LP environments is gaining importance due to (i) the increasing use of hypobaric chambers for long-term storage of high-value perishable agricultural commodities (5), (ii) the sampling of microbes in the limits of the upper atmosphere (4, 6–9), and (iii) the astrobiological implications of terrestrial microorganisms capable of living in extreme LP environments, such as those found on Mars (10, 11). Current knowledge of bacterial pressure responses is confined mostly to studies of (i) hyperbaric, or piezophilic, microbes and (ii) exposure to HP of pressure mesophiles, such as Escherichia coli or spores of Bacillus spp. (12–14). Ribosomal pyrosequencing analysis and culturing of deep-sea samples revealed that numerous species of Bacteria, Archaea, and micro-Eukarya exist at HP in the deep-sea piezosphere (15). Various mechanisms that contribute to the adaptation of piezophilic microbes to growth at HP have been discovered or postulated, such as changes in the composition of permeases in the outer membrane (16), pressure-sensing mechanisms (17), differential expression of terminal oxidases (18), differences in the lipid composition of membranes (19–21), differences in the structure and amino acid composition of proteins (22), elongation of helical regions within 16S rRNA (23), and changes in enzymatic volumes (2, 24–26). In contrast to the relative wealth of studies on how HP affects bacterial cells, there is a nearly complete lack of literature on mechanisms of microbial cellular responses to LP. Just as life over the entire range of extreme temperatures is represented by both cold- and heat-tolerant organisms, the study of the effect of HP on microbes alone does not fully describe the effects of pressure on cellular functions. The closest experimental analogue of the microbial cellular response to LP was a comparison of the transcriptomes of the piezophilic organism Photobacterium profundum strain SS9 when it was grown at atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and when it was grown at HP (28 MPa) (27). This exposure of SS9 to a relatively low pressure resulted in the upregulation of transcripts involved in amino acid and ion transport, amino acid metabolism, and a variety of other cellular processes (27). To date, several bacterial species have been tested for growth and/or metabolism under various LP regimes (28–31). In most species tested, growth was observed to be essentially normal from ∼101 kPa down to 10 kPa, but the growth of most microorganisms slowed dramatically at pressures below 10 kPa and essentially ceased at 2.5 kPa (11, 31). Two notable exceptions reported recently were six Carnobacterium isolates from Siberian permafrost (10) and a strain of Serratia liquefaciens identified in a screen of multiple laboratory strains of bacteria (11); both the Carnobacterium isolates and the S. liquefaciens strain were demonstrated to be able to grow at 0°C and 0.7 kPa in an anoxic, CO2-dominated atmosphere (i.e., a simulation of the Martian atmosphere). Growth of the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis is completely inhibited at 2.5 kPa and severely compromised at 5 kPa (11, 32). In order to probe the global response of B. subtilis to LP, we describe here transcription microarray experiments comparing the transcript levels of cells cultivated at 5 kPa and those of cells cultivated at ∼101 kPa.MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains, media, and growth conditions. All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strain WN624 (trpC2 amyE::spc) has been described in detail previously (32, 33). B. subtilis strain PB344, harboring a deletion-insertion mutation inactivating sigB, was obtained from Chet Price (34). B. subtilis strain BSM151, carrying a lacZ fusion to the SigB-dependent, general stress response (GSR)-induced ctc gene, was obtained from Uwe Völker (35). Standard protocols were used for the isolation of chromosomal DNA from donor strains (36), preparation of competent B. subtilis cells, and DNA-mediated transformation (37). Miller LB liquid or agar medium (38) was used throughout and supplemented, when necessary, with the appropriate antibiotic (final concentration): chloramphenicol (Cm; 5 μg/ml), neomycin (Neo; 5 μg/ml), spectinomycin (Spc; 100 μg/ml), or erythromycin (Erm, 1 μg/ml). Cells were grown under normal laboratory atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) or at low pressure (5 kPa) in an airtight desiccator attached to a programmable vacuum pump, as described in detail previously (32, 39). Cultures were shaken at moderate speed (∼150 rpm) on a rotary shaker at 27°C. The optical density was measured using a Klett-Summerson photometer fitted with a no. 66 (660 nm; red) filter. Under these conditions, 100 Klett units is equal to an optical density at 660 nm (OD660) of 1, which is equal to ∼1 × 108 CFU per ml. Microscopic examination showed that cells grown at 5 kPa were the same size and shape as those grown at ∼101 kPa; thus, an increase in the optical density corresponded to an increase in the total number of cells.

Isolation and labeling of total RNA. Equivalent masses of WN624 cells, obtained from 10 ml or 100 ml of overnight cultures grown at ∼101 kPa or 5 kPa, respectively, were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were frozen at −70°C. Overnight cultures were used due to the low optical density after 24 h of growth at 5 kPa (OD660, ∼0.4 to 0.8). Approximately 4 × 109 cells, estimated from the culture optical densities determined before centrifugation, were obtained from each sample. Total RNA was extracted from cells and treated with RNase-free DNase using a RiboPure-Bacteria kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting RNA sample concentrations and purity were determined by measurement of the UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm (40). RNA integrity numbers (RINs) (41) were obtained using an RNA 6000 Nano kit on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies); the average RIN of total RNA samples was 9.71.Transcription microarray experiments. Total RNA samples were sent to the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR) for fluorescent labeling with Cy3 or Cy5 and microarray analyses. A custom glass slide microarray (GE 8x15K 60-mer; Agilent Technologies) was designed and built using the B. subtilis strain 168 genome sequence (42). For each sample, approximately 12 μl of RNA at a concentration of 500 ng/μl was loaded for a total RNA content of 6 μg. For sample layouts, refer to Table S1 in the supplemental material.Microarray data analysis and normalization. Gene names, locations, and descriptions were cross-referenced using the GenoList archive server (http://genolist.pasteur.fr). Each microarray chip yielded 15,209 data points, equivalent to data for 4,103 genes with an average number of 3.7 measurements per gene. The raw data, green and red mean intensities, and dispersions were consistent across the sample comparisons. Raw data scatter plots for each control comparison indicated the high quality of the data, i.e., a high level of correlation for control chips and a high level of dispersion for test chips (Fig. 1). Loess normalization was applied to the microarray data to correct for the bias caused by inconsistencies in the relative fluorescence intensity between the Cy3 and Cy5 dyes. Variations between the multiple microarray experiments were removed using quantile normalization. The analysis of differential gene expression was performed using the Linear Models for Microarray Analysis (LIMMA) package (freely available at http://bioconductor.org) in the R programming language. The LIMMA package uses empirical Bayesian methods to provide stable results by moderating the standard errors of the estimated fold changes. Comparisons among the microarray chips were conducted graphically using the R program and are displayed as tables (see Tables S2 and S3 in the supplemental material). FIG 1.

Constructed strains carrying the SigB-dependent, GSR-inducible ctc-lacZ gene fusion (Table 1) were first tested for induction of β-galactosidase activity by ethanol, a known inducer of the GSR (34). Cultures were grown in liquid LB medium at 27°C to early logarithmic phase (∼30 Klett units) and then split. To one subculture was added ethanol to a final concentration of 5%, and incubation was continued for 45 min. To test for LP induction of ctc-lacZ expression, cultures were inoculated into LB medium at ∼5 Klett units and grown at 27°C to early logarithmic phase (∼20 Klett units). A zero-time sample was taken, and then the cultures were split into 12 2-ml subcultures, of which 6 were incubated at ∼101 kPa and 6 were incubated under various LP conditions (5, 10, 25, or 50 kPa) for a further 2.5 h. Culture OD660 values were determined, and then a 1-ml sample from each tube was centrifuged and the resulting cell pellet was frozen at −20°C for subsequent β-galactosidase assay. Thawed cells were lysed and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (43). β-Galactosidase activity is expressed in Miller units (38).Microarray data accession number. The complete set of microarray data has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at the  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number GSE50653.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Transcriptome analysis of strain WN624 at 5 kPa and ∼101 kPa. In order to gain a greater understanding of the global gene expression changes occurring in response to LP, strain WN624 was studied using transcriptional microarrays. Total RNA was extracted from cells after 24 h of growth at either 5 kPa or ∼101 kPa, and RNA labeling and chip analyses were conducted as described in Materials and Methods. The data are summarized by 2-dimemsional plots (Fig. 1). To confirm RNA integrity and the consistency of probe labeling, a dye-switch experiment was performed using the same total RNA labeled with Cy3 and Cy5; the RNA had been purified from strain WN624 cultured at ∼101 kPa (Fig. 1A) or 5 kPa (Fig. 1B). In each case, the data were tightly clustered and displayed high correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.9912 and 0.9959, respectively (Fig. 1A and B). In contrast, microarrays probed with total RNA isolated from strain WN624 cultivated at 5 kPa or ∼101 kPa exhibited much greater dispersion and a lower R2 of 0.6114 (Fig. 1C), indicating a profound alteration of the WN624 transcriptome in response to LP. In total, exposure of strain WN624 to 5 kPa resulted in the identification of 223 significantly upregulated transcripts (see Table S2 in the supplemental material) and 140 significantly downregulated transcripts (see Table S3 in the supplemental material), totaling approximately 9% of the Bacillus subtilis genome. Exposure to LP was found to lead to up- and/or downregulation of target genes for a large number of global regulons (see Tables S2 and S3 in the supplemental material). The regulons found to be the most dramatically altered by exposure to 5 kPa are listed in Table 2. Exposure of B. subtilis to LP most notably induced the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) (44); transition-state regulons such as AbrB/Abh (45, 46), CodY (47), Rok (48), SigH (49), Spo0A (50), and, to a lesser extent, SigD (51); anaerobic regulons, such as ResD (52) and, to a lesser extent, Fnr (53) and Rex (54); the carbon catabolite repression regulator CcpA (55); and the IolR regulator of myo-inositol catabolism (56). Interestingly, a large number of transcripts (88 in total) belonging to no known regulons were both induced and repressed by LP exposure (Table 2). Because LP exposure most strongly induced the SigB-mediated GSR regulon, we chose to study LP induction of the GSR in further detail. TABLE 2.

The GSR regulon in B. subtilis consists of ∼185 target genes, expression of which is induced in response to nutrient starvation and a variety of environmental stresses, such as heat, cold, ethanol, or salt (44, 57, 58). Transcriptional activation of GSR genes is under the control of the alternate sigma factor sigma B (σB or SigB), encoded by the sigB gene (44). The sigB gene is located within the rsbRSTUVW-sigB-rsbX operon, with a SigB-dependent promoter embedded upstream of rsbV allowing SigB-dependent transcriptional induction of the last four genes in the operon, including autoinduction of sigB. The activity of SigB is regulated by the RsbW anti-sigma factor system and the RsbV anti-anti-sigma factor system in response to a complex system of regulators encoded by the upstream rsbRSTU operon and the rsbX gene, whose products are responsive to various environmental stresses (44), and rsbPQ, whose products are involved in energy stress activation of the SigB response (59). Exposure of strain WN624 to an LP of 5 kPa resulted in a dramatic (∼35- to 55-fold) upregulation of mRNA levels for genes of the rsbWV-sigB-rsbX operon (Table S4 in the supplemental material) but not of rsbRSTU or rsbPQ transcripts. Of the 185 target genes in the GSR regulon (listed in Table S4 in the supplemental material), 88 of these genes (genes with underlined names in Table S4 in the supplemental material) are known to be strictly dependent upon SigB for their induction (57, 58, 60). Of these, 63 (70%) were upregulated in the microarray measuring mRNA from cells exposed to 5 kPa compared with their regulation in the microarray measuring mRNA from cells exposed to ∼101 kPa (Fig. 1C, Table S4 in the supplemental material). In order to compare GSR gene expression resulting from LP exposure to that resulting from other physical stresses, we compared the LP-mediated GSR of strain WN624 to the global GSR of B. subtilis exposed to ethanol, heat, or salt stress in previous studies (57, 60, 61) (Fig. 2). Very good concordance between the two responses was observed; LP exposure induced the upregulation of 86 genes, 70 of which (81%) were also induced by exposure to heat, ethanol, or salt (Fig. 2). Notably, 30 ethanol-, heat-, or salt-inducible GSR genes were not induced by LP, and LP exposure induced the expression of 16 genes not reported to be induced by ethanol, heat, or salt stress (Fig. 2), indicating that LP induced a GSR that only partially overlapped with that induced by ethanol, heat, or salt stress. FIG 2. Open in a new tab Venn diagram comparison of the set of genes belonging to the GSR regulon in strain WN624 induced by LP; the classical GSR inducers ethanol (EtOH), heat, and salt (taken from reference 60); both treatments; or neither treatment. The numbers of genes belonging to each category is indicated in parentheses, and gene names are listed. Underlined genes are strictly SigB dependent (see Table S4 in the supplemental material and the text for details).Induction of ctc-lacZ expression by LP. The observations described above led us to the notion that exposure of B. subtilis cells to LP induced the SigB-mediated GSR. Activation of the SigB-dependent ctc-lacZ reporter gene fusion is a reliable and well-established marker for GSR induction by all stresses studied to date (35). We therefore tested expression of a ctc-lacZ fusion in strains carrying either the wild-type sigB gene (strain WN1400) or the sigBΔ3::spc knockout mutation (strain WN1407) (Fig. 3). First, in order to ensure that ctc-lacZ expression was properly regulated by SigB in our strains, we induced the GSR by the classical treatment of exponentially growing cells with ethanol at a 5% final concentration and assayed for β-galactosidase activity after 45 min (Fig. 3A). In strain WN1400 carrying the sigB+ allele, expression of ctc-lacZ was strongly induced (∼7-fold) by ethanol treatment (Fig. 3A). In comparison, the basal level of expression of ctc-lacZ in strain WN1407 carrying the sigBΔ3::spc knockout mutation was lower, and its induction by ethanol was much weaker (∼2-fold) (Fig. 3A). These results were as expected; thus, the ctc-lacZ fusion appeared to be a reliable reporter of the SigB-dependent GSR in our strains. Next, the same two ctc-lacZ reporter strains were tested for induction of the GSR by exposure to 5 kPa of LP (Fig. 3A). After exposure to 5 kPa of LP for 2.5 h, ctc-lacZ expression was induced ∼4-fold in strain WN1400 carrying the wild-type sigB allele (Fig. 3A). In contrast, strain WN1407 carrying the sigBΔ3::spc knockout mutation exhibited a much lower basal level of ctc-lacZ expression and only very weak induction of the GSR (less than 2-fold) by LP (Fig. 3A). The results support the notion that LP induction of signals belonging to the GSR was indeed SigB dependent. FIG 3. Open in a new tab Determination of LP induction of the SigB-dependent GSR using a ctc-lacZ reporter fusion. The relevant genotypes of strains WN1400 (sigB+) and WN1407 (ΔsigB::spc) are denoted. (A) ctc-lacZ expression induced by 5% (vol/vol) ethanol or by exposure to 5 kPa (shaded bars) versus that in the uninduced controls (open bars). (B) Induction of ctc-lacZ expression at ∼101 kPa and various LPs (50, 25, 10, and 5 kPa) in strain WN1400 (sigB+). Data are averages and standard deviations for triplicate samples taken from two independent experiments.We were interested in determining the level of LP required to trigger the SigB-dependent GSR, so we measured the expression of the ctc-lacZ fusion in strain WN1400 (sigB+) at pressures of ∼101, 50, 25, 10, and 5 kPa (Fig. 3B). Strain WN1400 did not induce ctc-lacZ expression until the pressure was lowered to either 10 or 5 kPa (Fig. 3B).Inactivation of sigB does not alter fitness at ∼101 kPa or at 5 kPa. The microarray data (Table 2; Fig. 2) and the results of the ctc-lacZ reporter experiments (Fig. 3) indicated that the SigB-dependent GSR was induced by exposure to LP in B. subtilis. We were interested in investigating what effect, if any, a sigB knockout mutation would have on the relative fitness of B. subtilis at 5 kPa. Competition experiments, performed as described previously (32, 39), between 2 congenic strains carrying either the wild-type sigB gene or a sigBΔ2::cat insertion-deletion mutation showed that inactivation of sigB did not significantly change its relative fitness either at ∼101 kPa or at 5 kPa (data not shown). This result is consistent with the results of previous experiments showing that a sigB null mutant had no noticeable disadvantage compared to the wild type when grown under any of the stress conditions known to induce the SigB-mediated GSR (34, 44). Therefore, as with other physical stresses, LP exposure appeared to induce a subset of the SigB-dependent GSR; however, GSR induction did not improve growth under LP. Relatively little is known about how hypobaria affects cellular processes or how microbial life is affected by and responds to LP. In this study, we found by microarray experiments that Bacillus subtilis strain WN624 sensed and responded to LP stress by activation of at least a dozen known regulons, including the SigB-mediated GSR, and this notion was confirmed by the SigB-dependent induction of ctc-lacZ fusion expression by exposure of cells to LP. The nonoptimal pressure responses of both piezophiles grown at standard atmospheric pressure (27) and pressure mesophiles grown at elevated pressures (14) are known to be the induction of stress response genes, such as heat and cold shock proteins. In this communication, we show that exposure of a pressure mesophile to LP upregulated several global regulons, including the SigB-dependent GSR. It was interesting to note that strain WN624 did not induce the GSR until the pressure was lowered to 10 kPa, the equivalent of the pressure at an altitude of ∼18 km, over twice the height of Mt. Everest (8,848 m). As stated previously, the known biosphere is contained within the troposphere, where the low-pressure limit is ∼10 kPa (62). Interestingly, this is also the lower limit of pressure before significant decreases in growth rate and colony size were demonstrated in a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species (10, 11, 29, 31). Therefore, it appears for most bacteria (with a few notable recent exceptions mentioned above [10, 11]) that there exists a low-pressure limit at ∼10 kPa, below which cellular processes begin to be inhibited and the GSR is induced in B. subtilis. As observed previously with other environmental stresses (ethanol, heat, high salt), the SigB-mediated GSR does not seem to be required for growth at 5 kPa. This does not rule out the possibility that a stress-related, SigB-independent gene(s) might be necessary for B. subtilis growth at LP. Future experiments to address this issue are in progress.Toward an understanding of the LP response. A previous study compared the growth kinetics of B. subtilis in LB medium at either ∼101 kPa or 5 kPa (32). At normal atmospheric pressure, cells grew to a high density (>300 Klett units), but at 5 kPa, growth ceased abruptly at ∼40 Klett units and remained unchanged for 24 h. Growth inhibition was apparently caused by some aspect of LP exposure and not by nutrient limitation, as cells immediately resumed exponential growth upon an increase of pressure back to ∼101 kPa (32). In an attempt to integrate these prior observations with the results obtained with the transcription microarrays, the following scenario might be envisioned as a preliminary working model, although others are certainly possible. One consequence of lowering the headspace pressure from ∼101 to 5 kPa is to lower the partial pressure of oxygen in the medium by a factor of roughly 20; this might immediately lead to induction of the anaerobic response involving the ResD, Fnr, and Rex regulons (see Tables S2 and S3 in the supplemental material). These regulators in turn induce expression of a host of genes involved in fermentation and anaerobic respiration. However, because Miller LB medium lacks fermentable sugars or alternative electron acceptors, such as nitrate, cessation of growth and entrance into stationary phase rapidly ensue. Entrance into stationary phase activates the SigB-mediated GSR as well as a number of regulators of the transition state, such as AbrB/Adh, CodY, Rok, Spo0A, and SigH; in addition, CcpA has been shown to remodel carbon metabolism in the early stationary phase (63). Induction of IolR by LP is difficult to fit into this scheme because IolR is not a global regulator but is a specific regulator of genes involved in myo-inositol catabolism (the operons iolABCDEFGHIJ and iolRS and the iolT gene) (56). However, expression of this small regulon has also been documented to be strongly induced upon entrance into the stationary phase (64). In summary, exposure of B. subtilis to LP activates a large number of responses, including the SigB-dependent GSR. At present, it is known that activation of sigB expression can occur in response to three pathways responsive to energy stress (65); exposure to physical stresses, such as ethanol, heat, or high salt (34); or cold stress (35). Determining which signaling pathway(s) is induced by LP will shed further insight into how the GSR is induced, directly or indirectly, by LP and is a course for future work.Supplementary Material Supplemental material supp_80_16_4788__index.html (1.3KB, html) ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Uwe Völker and Chet Price for the generous donation of strains.

Synergistic radioprotective effects of α/β-type but not γ-type SASP were also identified, indicating that α/β-type SASP's binding to spore DNA is important in preventing DNA damage due to reactive oxygen species generated by ionizing radiation.INTRODUCTION Spores of Bacillus subtilis have been used extensively as biological indicators for industrial purposes such as sterilization or decontamination. Spores have also been shown to be suitable dosimeters for probing terrestrial and extraterrestrial ionizing radiation in environmental and astrobiological studies (1–3; reviewed in references 4, 5, 6, and 7). Ionizing radiation can damage cellular components through direct transfer of radiation energy into biomolecules (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins) and indirectly by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the radiolysis of intracellular H2O (8–11). The biological effects of ionizing radiation are thought to arise from the formation of single- and double-strand breaks (SSB and DSB) in cellular DNA and clustered DNA damage, e.g., two or more closely spaced lesions, including abasic sites, base lesions, SSB, and DSB. The biological effects of ionizing radiation depend on the quality and the dose of radiation and on the cell type (9–11). Linear energy transfer (LET) represents the energy lost per unit distance as an ionizing particle travels through a material, and it is used to quantify the effects of ionizing radiation on biological specimens (5, 10–13). High-LET radiation sources include protons, and high-energy-charged (HZE) particles give densely ionizing radiation, since they lose their energy in a small distance and thus cause dense ionization along their tracks and can give localized multiple DNA-damaging events. Low-LET radiation sources, such as X rays, give sparsely ionizing radiation, since they produce ionizations sparsely along their track and, hence, almost homogeneously within a cell. The biological effects of high-LET radiation are in general much higher than those of low-LET radiation of the same energy (10, 12, 13). This is because high-LET radiation deposits most of its energy within the volume of one cell and the damage to DNA is therefore larger (9–11). This is attributable to the formation of clusters of damage that result in two or more DNA lesions along the tracks of high-LET radiation sources, i.e., the physical path of the applied ionizing radiation source in a cell. Previous studies have indicated that in both pro- and eukaryotic cells or under highly scavenging conditions mimicking those for ROS scavenging in the cell, one-fourth of the lesions induced in DNA by low-LET radiation can be ascribed to direct effects increasing up to 80% for high-LET particles (9, 11, 12). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (HO·) are major oxidizing species produced by the radiolysis of water, and superoxide ions (O2·−) are formed in the presence of dissolved oxygen (12, 13). Lethal and mutagenic effects induced by ionizing radiation are thought to be the result of DNA damage caused during the course of irradiation (11, 14–16). Spore DNA resides in the innermost spore compartment, the core, and dormant spores of B. subtilis possess a complex arsenal of protective attributes in the core, in particular a low core water content as well as abundant novel core constituents such as (i) the calcium chelate of dipicolinic acid (Ca-DPA), which comprises ∼25% of core dry weight, and (ii) small, acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP) of the α/β type, which bind spore DNA and protect it from many types of damage, including UV photoproducts, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, and oxidative lesions (17, 18, 47; reviewed in references 4, 6, and 19). Spore DNA is saturated with a group of unique proteins called α/β-type SASP, which are encoded by multiple genes and synthesized only during sporulation in the developing spore. These α/β-type SASP are nonspecific DNA-binding proteins that bind to random-sequence double-strand DNA and comprise approximately 5% of total spore protein (reviewed in references 6 and 18). The high levels of α/β-type SASP in spores are sufficient to saturate the spore DNA, and the DNA within this nucleoprotein complex is protected from a variety of environmental insults (4, 7). Germinating spores also can detoxify ROS using enzymes such as catalase (KatX) and superoxide dismutase (SodA), although these enzymes play no role in dormant spore resistance to oxidizing agents, most likely because enzymes in the spore core are inactive due to the core's low water content (20–23). Mechanisms to prevent damage caused by ROS, in particular damage to DNA, include protective DNA-binding proteins as well as enzymes such as alkyl hydroperoxide reductases, catalases, and superoxide dismutases, which can destroy the oxidizing agents alkyl hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide, respectively. A study of the role of oxidative stress responsive proteins such as the DNA-binding protein MrgA, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, catalases, and superoxide dismutases in the resistance of B. subtilis spores to oxidative stress caused by paraquat and hydrogen peroxide exposure showed that inactivation of genes coding for the protective enzymes or MrgA had no effect on the spores' heat or hydrogen peroxide resistance (21). Spore DNA damage can also be repaired during germination via a number of different pathways such as direct reversal, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ, encoded by YkoV and YkoU), base and nucleotide excision repair (BER and NER, respectively), mismatch repair, recombination-mediated repair, and translesion synthesis (24–28; reviewed in references 6 and 29). Two AP endonucleases, ExoA and Nfo, have also been implicated in the repair of AP sites caused by oxidizing agents in germinating B. subtilis spores (24). However, there has been no systematic study of the relationship between the spore core protective features (i.e., α/β/γ-type SASP, DPA, and core hydration), the oxidative stress response (by MrgA), ROS detoxification (via SodA or KatX), and DNA repair (by NHEJ or BER) in spores' ionizing radiation resistance, and this is the subject of the present work.MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains, growth, sporulation, and spore purification. The B. subtilis strains used in this work are listed in Table 1, and all are isogenic with the wild-type strain PS832. Spores were obtained by cultivation under vigorous aeration at 37°C for 7 days in double-strength liquid Schaeffer sporulation medium (30), and spores were purified and stored as described previously (31–33). When appropriate, chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml), neomycin (10 μg/ml), spectinomycin (100 μg/ml), erythromycin (1 μg/ml), or tetracycline (10 μg/ml) was added to the medium. Spore preparations consisted of single spores with no detectable clumps and were free (>99%) of growing cells, germinated spores, and cell debris, as seen in the phase-contrast microscope (32–34).

Measurement of spore resistance to ionizing radiation. Preparation of spore samples for radiation exposure has been described in detail previously (33, 34). In brief, suspensions of spores of the different B. subtilis strains (Table 1) were prepared in sterile distilled water to a final concentration of 1 × 108 spores per ml. Triplicate samples of spores in water (100 μl) were individually exposed to three different types of ionizing radiation: X rays (200 keV/15 mA), protons (with energy of 218 MeV, LET of 0.4 keV/μm, and a range of 301 mm in water), and high-energy-charged iron ions (Fe; with energy of 500 MeV/nucleon, LET of 200 keV/μm, and a range of 99 mm in water). X ray, proton, and Fe irradiations were conducted at the German Aerospace Center, Institute of Aerospace Medicine (DLR-ME), in Cologne, Germany, at the University of Florida Proton Therapy Institute (UF-PTI), Jacksonville, Florida, USA, and at the heavy ion medical accelerator (HIMAC) facility at the National Institute for Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Chiba, Japan, respectively. Details on the irradiation geometry of the NIRS-HIMAC, DLR-ME, and UF-PTI facilities, beam monitoring, dosimetry, and dose calculations have been described (34–37).Numerical and statistical analysis. Spore survival was determined from appropriate dilutions in distilled water as colony-forming ability after incubation overnight at 37°C on nutrient broth (NB) agar plates (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) (33, 34, 36). The surviving fraction of B. subtilis spores was determined from the ratio N/N0, where N is the number of CFU of the irradiated sample and N0 that of the nonirradiated controls. Spore inactivation curves were obtained as described previously (34). Data are reported as D10-values, the dose of ionizing radiation killing 90% of the initial spore population (34). All data are expressed as averages ± standard deviations (n = 3). The significance of the differences in the survival rates and relative sensitivities were determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA), using SigmaPlot software Version 12.0 (Systat Software GmbH, Erkrath, Germany). Values were evaluated in multigroup pairwise combinations, and differences with P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant (33, 34, 36).RESULTS The importance of the two types of SASP, the DNA-binding α/β type and non-DNA-binding γ type, alone and in combination with various other protective spore core components, including core water content and DPA, has been assessed to establish their roles as radioprotectants. B. subtilis spores have several additional potential mechanisms for minimizing damage to spore DNA including BER via AP endonucleases (by ExoA and Nfo), DNA double-strand break repair (via NHEJ by YkoU and V), and radical detoxification (superoxide dismutase SodA and major spore catalase KatX), as well as via the oxidative stress response (DNA-binding protein MrgA); spores of strains lacking these various gene products have been also included in this study. Wild-type and mutant spores (Table 1) were subjected to three different types of ionizing radiation, X rays, protons, and high-energy Fe ions. Role of spore core components in ionizing radiation resistance. Spore structures (e.g., the spore coat and cortex) and components in the spore core (e.g., Ca-DPA, α/β-type SASP) have previously been demonstrated to protect spores from inactivation after exposure to various sporicidal treatments such as exposure to UV radiation, hydrogen peroxide, or heat (reviewed in references 4, 6, and 7). Spores lacking various spore core components were irradiated with X rays (Fig. 1A), protons (Fig. 1B), or Fe ions (Fig. 1C). In order, from most to least sensitive, were spores of mutants in sspA (encoding one of two major α/β-type SASP [38]) > sspB (encoding the less abundant major α/β-type SASP [38]) > dacB, previously shown to exhibit a 1.6-fold-increased core water content (52 to 65%) compared to that of wild-type spores (34 to 41%) (22, 23) > sleB plus spoVF (which allow isolation of stable spores that lack Ca-DPA [39]) > sspE (encoding the only γ-type SASP; termed γ− spores), which is equivalent to the wild type (Fig. 1). FIG 1. Open in a new tab Spore resistance to irradiation with X rays (A), protons (B), and high-energy charged Fe ions (C). Spores differing in various core components, including major α/β-type SASP, the single γ-type SASP, and Ca-DPA (due to loss of DPA synthetase encoded by spoVF), or core water content (due to the dacB mutation), with (white bars) and without (gray bars) protection by α/β-type SASP. Spores were irradiated in water, and D10 values are expressed as averages ± standard deviations (n = 3) as described in the text. Lowercase letters above the bars denote groups significantly different by ANOVA (P < 0.05). Note the differences in the y axes of panels A, B, and C.Radiation resistance of spores carrying mutations in sspE, dacB, or both sleB and spoVF was tested either in a wild-type background or in an sspA sspB background lacking both major α/β-type SASP (termed α−β− spores) (Fig. 2). The combined effects on spore sensitivity, from most sensitive to least, were as follows: α−β− dacB > α−β− sleB spoVF > α−β− ≫ wild-type ≈ γ− (Fig. 2). The results show that spore core dehydration and DPA, but not γ-type SASP, function in addition to α/β-type SASP as radioprotectants in the spore core. FIG 2. Open in a new tab Impact of spore core-specific components on spore resistance to different types of ionizing radiation: X rays (A), protons (B), and high-energy charged Fe ions (C) with (white bars) and without (gray bars) protection by α/β-type SASP. Relative spore sensitivity was expressed as the ratio of the D10 value of spores of each mutant strain to the D10 value of spores of the corresponding reference strain (wild-type or α−β−) from each irradiation, using data from Fig. 1. Data are averages and standard deviations (n = 3). Actual data values are given above the corresponding columns in Fig. 1. Lowercase letters next to the bars denote groups significantly different by ANOVA (P < 0.05).Role of oxidative stress responses and DNA repair in spore ionizing radiation resistance. Spores of strains defective in ROS detoxification, the oxidative stress response DNA-binding protein MrgA, or DNA repair were exposed to X rays, protons, and Fe ions, and their sensitivities were compared (Fig. 3). Spores deficient in radical detoxification (sodA or katX spores) were no more sensitive than wild-type spores to any type of ionizing radiation tested (Fig. 3), as expected given the minimal activity of enzymes in the spore core. Spores lacking a major oxidative-stress-protective protein (mrgA spores) were significantly more sensitive than wild-type spores to X rays and Fe ions, but not to protons, which could be due to the different spectra of lesions induced by the three types of radiation (9, 11, 15) (Fig. 3). Spores lacking BER (exoA nfo spores) and double-strand break repair (ykoVU spores) were both significantly more sensitive to all types of radiation than wild-type spores (Fig. 3). Comparison of the spore radiation resistance in wild-type and α−β− backgrounds showed that in response to X rays only the ykoVU spores showed an additive effect with the loss of α/β-type SASP (Fig. 4A). In response to proton exposure, the effects of the katX, mrgA, exoA nfo, and ykoVU mutations (but not sodA) were all potentiated in the α−β− background (Fig. 4B). In response to Fe ions, only the exoA nfo (BER-deficient) and ykoVU (NHEJ-deficient) mutant spores demonstrated a significantly enhanced sensitivity in the α−β− background (Fig. 4C). FIG 3.

Spores deficient in radical detoxification by SodA (superoxide dismutase), KatX (major spore catalase), DNA protection by MrgA (oxidative stress resistance DNA-binding protein), DNA repair by ExoA and Nfo, or YkoV and YkoU (with [white bars] and without [gray bars] protection by α/β-type SASP), were exposed in water, and D10 values are expressed as averages ± standard deviations (n = 3) as described in the text. Lowercase letters above the bars denote groups significantly different by ANOVA (P < 0.05). Note the differences in the y axes of panels A, B, and C.FIG 4.

Relative spore sensitivity is expressed as the ratio of the D10 value of spores of each mutant strain to the D10 value of spores of the corresponding reference strain (wild-type or α−β−) from each irradiation, using data from Fig. 3.

Lowercase letters next to the bars denote groups significantly different by ANOVA (P < 0.05).DISCUSSION In regard to the characteristic resistance to ionizing radiation, spores of the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis have often been used to evaluate sterilization efforts in areas of food preservation, medical sterilization, and decontamination of potential biohazardous materials (3, 4, 6). Ionizing radiation is known to cause damage to numerous targets within the cell, including DNA, due both to (i) direct interaction of the radiation with the target molecule and to (ii) indirect effects due to the production of reactive species such as oxygen radicals (9, 10, 12, 13, 15). Ionizing radiation induces a large variety of damages to DNA bases and through interaction with the sugar moiety can cause formation of DNA strand breaks, either SSB or DSB. DNA strand breaks were reported to be the major lesions in the genome of spores exposed to ionizing radiation (reviewed in references 4 and 7), caused either directly by the highly energetic photons or accelerated particles or indirectly via interaction of radiation-induced free radicals, e.g., ROS, with the DNA (9, 13, 15, 16). The results of several radiobiological studies at accelerators and in space experiments lead to the assumption that at least two qualitatively different lesions are formed depending on the type and energy of the applied ionizing radiation. The spore's structure and chemical composition play major roles in spore resistance (6, 7, 18). The spore's general structure is very different from that of a growing cell, with a number of features and constituents unique to spores (4). Several of these features have been shown to be involved in spore resistance to some chemicals and physical treatments, but little is known of their role in spore resistance to ionizing radiation. Spore DNA is saturated with a group of SASP that bind to DNA largely on the outside of the DNA helix and straighten and stiffen the DNA while changing the DNA to an A-like helix (reviewed in reference 6 and references therein). As a consequence, DNA properties in spores are dramatically different from those in vegetative cells, e.g., spore DNA complexed with SASP is much more resistant to chemical attack, thermal degradation, and UV radiation (6, 7, 17, 22, 40), strongly suggesting that SASP may also be important for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, as indicated in earlier studies testing mutants lacking a single SASP (17, 33). The current work has shown that protective components in the spore core are important determinants of spore resistance to X ray, proton, and heavy Fe ion bombardment with the order of importance being as follows: α/β-type SASP ≫ core dehydration > DPA. In contrast, the single major γ-type SASP does not bind to DNA and plays no protective role in spore ionizing radiation resistance, as has also been found when spore resistance to many other agents has been tested (23, 37; reviewed in reference 6) (Fig. 1 and 2). In the dormant state, spores remain metabolically inactive, and thus substantial DNA, protein, tRNA, and ribosome damage may accumulate, and the spores are incapable of repairing and/or degrading such damaged DNA and proteins (6, 7, 18). Consequently, damage to DNA, proteins, or other essential components of bacterial spores poses a unique problem, since such repair of such damage does not occur until the processes of germination and outgrowth, when spores reactivate and prepare to return to vegetative growth (6, 7, 28). Repair of DSB and base modification/loss via NHEJ and BER appear to be important mechanisms for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, and the MrgA-mediated oxidative stress response (with effects in wild-type spores for X-ray stress and in α−β− spores for proton radiation resistance) plays a lesser role. In contrast, ROS detoxification by catalase or superoxide dismutase appears to play a very minor role, if any, in spore resistance to ionizing radiation, as is also the case in spore resistance to oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide (20, 21) (Fig. 3 and 4). Clearly the data indicate that spore DNA is a major target of lethal ionizing radiation damage, based on the observation that the major factors contributing significantly to spore survival (Fig. 3 and 4) in response to different types of ionizing radiation are known to be important in either DNA protection in spores or DNA repair in spore germination and outgrowth. The findings in this communication thus complement the results from microarray experiments demonstrating upregulation of stress-related regulons responding to DNA damage (SOS response) and oxidative stress (PerR regulon) during germination of spores exposed to space conditions, including the effects of galactic cosmic radiation (41). Spores appear to have two possible ways to minimize deleterious effects of ionizing radiation: (i) by protecting dormant spore DNA from damage in the first place (Fig. 1 and 2) and (ii) by ensuring detoxification and repair of direct and indirect damage during spore germination (Fig. 3 and 4). Because ionizing radiation causes such a wide spectrum of direct and indirect DNA damage, it will be interesting to determine the contributions of additional error-free and error-prone DNA repair pathways (e.g., mismatch repair, translesion synthesis, and homologous recombination [29, 42–44]), to gain further detailed insights into spore resistance to ionizing radiation.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Andrea Schröder and Petra Schwendner for their excellent technical assistance during parts of this work and Mario Pedraza-Reyes for his generous donation of B. subtilis strains.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus are persistent inhabitants of human spaceflight habitats and represent potential opportunistic pathogens. The effect of the human spaceflight environment on the growth and the frequency of mutations to antibiotic resistance in the model organism Staphylococcus epidermidis strain ATCC12228 was investigated. Six cultures of the test organism were cultivated in biological research in canisters–Petri dish fixation units for 122 h on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the SpaceX-3 resupply mission. Asynchronous ground controls (GCs) consisted of identical sets of cultures cultivated for 122 h in the ISS Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center. S. epidermidis exhibited significantly lower viable counts but significantly higher frequencies of mutation to rifampicin (Rif) resistance in space vs. GC cultures. The spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene leading to RifR was altered in S. epidermidis isolates cultivated in the ISS compared to GCs. The results suggest that the human spaceflight environment induces unique physiologic stresses on growing bacterial cells leading to changes in mutagenic potential.

    "introduction": "Introduction Planning is currently underway for future long-duration missions through interplanetary space to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars (NASA, 2015). Both the National Research Council (NRC) and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) have assigned a high priority to studies aimed at better understanding astronaut health risks during space exploration; furthermore, these agencies have recognized the International Space Station (ISS) as the best available platform to conduct research activities to address these challenges (International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG), 2013; National Research Council [NRC], 2014). Studies conducted during short- and medium-duration missions (from a few days up to ~1 year) in vehicles such as Spacelab, Soyuz, Shuttle, Mir, and ISS have provided a wealth of information concerning astronaut health and function in the spaceflight environment of low-Earth orbit (LEO; Taylor, 2015). Based on the knowledge gained from these missions, NASA has developed successful risk mitigation strategies. However, long-duration missions (greater than 1 year) into interplanetary space are more likely to expose astronauts to new and higher risks to their health and performance than excursions to LEO, primarily due to: (i) chronic exposure to microgravity; (ii) increased exposure to ionizing radiation from solar and galactic sources; and (iii) extreme confinement and isolation (Reitz, 2008; NRC, 2011; Zeitlin et al., 2013; Taylor, 2015). One particular concern for planners of long-duration missions is the possibility of infectious disease (Scott-Conner et al., 2015; Taylor, 2015). Prolonged exposure to the stresses of spaceflight can lead to dysregulation of astronauts’ immune systems, thus increasing their susceptibility to infectious disease (Crucian et al., 2009; Guéguinou et al., 2009; Taylor, 2015). To minimize the possibility of bringing infectious disease agents onboard, pre-launch mitigation protocols are in place such as screening astronauts for certain microbes and irradiation of food (NASA, 2010). However, the essential nature of the human microbiome (Cho and Blaser, 2012) renders it impossible to remove all potentially infectious microorganisms from astronauts. Indeed, deterioration of astronauts’ immune systems in space has led to increased reactivation of latent viral infections by Varicella–Zoster, Epstein–Barr, and Cytomegalovirus during 12–16 day Shuttle flights (Mehta et al., 2014). Opportunistic bacterial infections of the urinary tract, upper respiratory tract, and subcutaneous tissue have been documented from Shuttle missions STS-1 to STS-108 (Sams, 2009), and conjunctivitis, respiratory tract, and dental infections were documented among long-term inhabitants of space station Mir (Ball and Evans, 2001). Numerous studies have been conducted to understand how bacteria themselves respond to the human spaceflight environment, with particular regard to the possibility of their enhanced pathogenic potential or resistance to antimicrobial treatments [reviewed extensively in Rosenzweig et al. (2014)]. In some spaceflight experiments, it has been observed that spaceflight can lead to enhanced virulence in some bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but not in others (S. typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes; note: in S. typhimurium, both cases have been observed in different spaceflight experiments; reviewed in Rosenzweig et al., 2014). Taken together, the data suggest that the combined phenomena of altered astronaut immunity and heightened virulence of some microbes in the spaceflight environment might lead to an increased incidence of astronaut infections by some opportunistic pathogens during extended missions (Klaus and Howard, 2006). Space stations start out as basically clean environments, but upon habitation, they are rapidly colonized by numerous environmental and astronaut-associated species of microorganisms, which proceed to adapt and evolve in response to selective pressures unique to the spaceflight environment (Novikova, 2004; van Tongeren et al., 2007). A number of opportunistic pathogens have been isolated from space station crew quarters and from astronauts, including both Gram-positive genera (Bacillus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) and Gram-negative genera (Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Flavobacterium, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Morganella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Serratia, Stenotrophomonas, and Yersinia; Ilyin, 2005; Klaus and Howard, 2006). From studies of astronauts on space stations Mir and ISS, it was documented that the microbial diversity of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was lowered during spaceflight, while the proportion of opportunistic pathogens increased. In addition, extensive exchange of microbial flora of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts has been documented among astronauts sharing confined space habitats [reviewed in Taylor and Sommer (2005)]. Recent microbial monitoring of the ISS environment revealed that Bacillus and Staphylococcus spp., are the most ubiquitous organisms cultured from the ISS, being especially abundant in samples taken from crew quarters, vacuum debris, and HEPA filters (Venkateswaran et al., 2014; Checinska et al., 2015). Not surprisingly, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequently encountered organism in the ISS microbiome, due to its close association with humans as a skin commensal (Venkateswaran et al., 2014). As on Earth, antibiotics are the predominant treatment of choice for bacterial infections on human spaceflight missions. Knowledge about the efficacy of antimicrobial interventions to treat infections during spaceflight is limited, given the difficulty to assess the interplay between pharmacokinetics of antibiotics or the physiologies of host and microbiome, both of which are altered in the spaceflight environment (Wotring, 2012; Taylor, 2015). Decreased susceptibility of microbes to antibiotics has been observed in the space environment during experiments performed on Salyut 7 (Tixador et al., 1985) and the Space Shuttles Challenger (Lapchine et al., 1986) and Discovery (Tixador et al., 1994). Mutation is a common mechanism by which bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. A body of evidence indicates that the spectrum of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance can be altered by the environment to which microbes are exposed (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002; Nicholson and Park, 2015), including the spaceflight environment (Yatagai et al., 2000). In the experiments described here, we chose to study mutations leading to resistance to the antibiotic rifampcin (Rif), because: (i) Rif is a clinically relevant antibiotic used singly and in combination to treat a wide variety of infections; and (ii) RifR mutations are easily identified by nucleotide sequencing, as they reside within small regions of the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNA polymerase (Severinov et al., 1993). Taken together, the above observations indicate that the possibility must be considered of antibiotic-resistant strains emerging, and potentially becoming dominant types, in the microbiomes of crew members. Therefore, to explore the development of antibiotic resistance in a potential opportunistic pathogen during long-term human habitation in space, the present communication describes experiments using the biological research in canisters (BRIC) hardware in which growth of S. epidermidis, as well as the frequency and spectrum of mutation to RifR, were measured after spaceflight on the ISS and compared to asynchronous ground controls (GCs).",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Bacterial Strain, Media, and Growth Conditions The strain used was S. epidermidis strain ATCC12228 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA. Medium used throughout was trypticase soy yeast extract (TSY) medium consisting of (g/L): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5; yeast extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; and final pH 7. For semisolid plates, agar was added to TSY at 15.0 g/L. As appropriate, the antibiotic rifampicin (Rif; Sigma–Aldrich) was added to TSY at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL. Sample Preparation Staphylococcus epidermidis cells were prepared by overnight growth in TSY liquid medium and a calibration curve was constructed relating Optical Density at 660 nm (OD660) to viable cell titer. Overnight cultures were diluted in TSY to a working concentration of 108 CFU per mL prior to use. Aliquots of 0.1 mL (~107 CFU) of the suspension were applied to the bottoms of sterile 60-mm diameter Petri dishes (Falcon cat. no. 1007) and air-dried for 48–72 h at room temperature prior to use. BRIC Spaceflight Hardware The experiments described here utilized BRIC spaceflight hardware, which has been described in detail previously (Paul et al., 2012). BRIC canisters hold six 60-mm diameter Petri dish bottom halves in small subcompartments called Petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Each PDFU allows for injection of medium, referred to as actuation, to initiate bacterial growth. For flight (FL) experiments, one BRIC canister was used containing six PDFUs. Immediately, adjacent to the FL canister was deployed a HOBO® temperature data logger (Onset Computer Co., Bourne, MA, USA). Post-flight asynchronous GC experiments were conducted using the same hardware and configuration as in the FL experiment. Each PDFU was loaded with a Petri dish containing air-dried cells, and 13 mL of sterile TSY medium was loaded into a separate reservoir. To prevent contamination, all reagents and equipment used were sterilized prior to use and PDFUs were assembled using aseptic technique within a biological containment hood. Spaceflight Timeline The BRIC–PDFU payload described above was the 18th BRIC mission to space, and was designated BRIC-18. The BRIC-18 hardware payload was launched on the third SpaceX cargo resupply mission to the ISS (SpaceX-3) on April 18, 2014, using the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule configuration. The Dragon capsule docked with the ISS on April 21, 2014. The BRIC canister was transferred to the ISS on April 22, 2014 and stowed in the US laboratory module. Actuation of the PDFUs was performed on April 30, 2014 at 10:08 EDT (Figure 1A) and samples were incubated at ISS ambient temperature (Figure 1B) until May 5, 2014 at 12:04 PM EDT, resulting in a total incubation time of 122 h. Growth was terminated by transfer of the BRIC canister to the onboard −80°C MELFI freezer. Samples were returned to Earth in the Dragon capsule on May 18, 2014 and were maintained in the frozen state until return to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for de-integration and further processing. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab (A) Actuation of BRIC-18 canister by astronaut Rick Mastracchio aboard the ISS. (B) Temperature data from BRIC-18 flight (FL; blue line) and ground control (GC; green line) samples. Actuation time is denoted by the upward arrow and termination of experiment by moving to −80°C freezer is denoted by the downward arrow. Ground Control Timeline Asynchronous GC experiments were performed in a BRIC canister according to the timeline determined during the FL experiment. Samples were incubated in the KSC ISS Environmental Simulation Chamber following the temperature regime recorded during flight (Figure 1B), and growth was terminated by transfer to a −80°C freezer, where samples were stored until further processing. Post-Experiment Sample Processing Both FL and GC BRIC canisters were transferred from storage at −80°C to a +4°C refrigerator and allowed to thaw overnight. Petri dishes were removed from PDFUs and cells were resuspended using sterile disposable rubber spatulas. Resuspended cultures were transferred to sterile 50-mL conical centrifuge tubes, and the total volume recovered was measured. For viable counts, aliquots from cultures were diluted serially 10-fold in TSY medium, dilutions plated on TSY, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h to obtain CFU/mL. To obtain the total CFU per PDFU, the CFU/mL were multiplied by the volume of liquid recovered. To select for RifR mutants, cultures were concentrated by centrifugation, plated without dilution onto TSY + Rif plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h. The frequency of mutation to RifR was calculated by dividing the total number of RifR mutants by the total number of viable cells from each culture. Individual RifR mutants were streak-purified on TSY + Rif plates and processed for DNA sequencing. DNA Sequencing and Analyses Primers used for PCR amplification of two RifR regions of the S. epidermidis rpoB gene are listed in Table 1. The corresponding rpoB regions were amplified by PCR directly from cells as previously described (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002) and their nucleotide sequences determined at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR). Multiple rpoB sequences were aligned using the online Clustal Omega server1 to identify the position of mutations relative to the wild-type rpoB sequence obtained in parallel from S. epidermidis ATCC12228.

    "results": "Results Temperature Data in FL vs. GC Experiments Temperature data were logged at 10-min intervals during the FL and GC experiments and the data are presented in Figure 1B. The average temperature recorded during the growth period in FL was 25.1 ± 0.12°C until 107 h, at which time the immediately adjacent FL HOBO unit malfunctioned for the duration of the experiment (Figure 1B). However, the HOBO malfunction did not affect the course of the FL experiment, as other HOBO units in nearby BRIC canisters functioned correctly and confirmed a nominal temperature profile (data not shown). The average temperature in the GC experiment was 24.8 ± 0.16°C, differing from the FL experiment by only 0.3°C. The HOBO unit in the GC experiment performed nominally for the entire 122 h duration of the experiment (Figure 1B). Staphylococcus epidermidis Growth and Frequency of Mutation to RifR in FL vs. GC Viable counts of the cultures in all six PDFUs were determined for both FL and GC samples (Figure 2A). All S. epidermidis cultures grew to high titers in both FL and GC experiments, and viable counts were significantly higher in the GC cultures (Figure 2A). To determine the frequency of mutation to RifR, cells from the FL and GC cultures were concentrated by centrifugation and plated onto TSY + Rif. FL cultures of S. epidermidis exhibited a 24-fold higher frequency of mutation to RifR than did GC cultures, and this difference was found to be highly significant (Figure 2B). FIGURE 2.

Spectrum of RifR rpoB Mutations in FL vs. GC Experiments in S. epidermidis Chromosomal DNA was isolated from a total of 67 FL and 57 GC RifR mutants, and the N-cluster and Clusters I, II, and III of their rpoB genes were amplified by PCR and sequenced. The data are presented in Tables 2 and 3 and summarized graphically in Figure 3. Examination of the data revealed notable differences in the mutational spectrum within rpoB between the FL and GC samples. Table 2.

The centerline depicts the wild-type RpoB amino acid sequence with coordinates. The lines above and below the amino acid sequence represent the wild-type DNA sequence of rpoB. Mutations found in RifR mutants obtained from FL and GC are denoted, as are the resulting deduced amino acid changes. Two double mutations found in the FL samples are indicated by stippled and shaded backgrounds. N-Cluster No mutations were detected in the N-cluster of the S. epidermidis rpoB gene in either the FL or GC samples.Cluster I All of the RifR mutations identified in both FL and GC samples of S. epidermidis were found to occur in Cluster I (Table 2; Figure 3). In agreement with previous reports (Severinov et al., 1993; Campbell et al., 2001; Nicholson and Maughan, 2002; Perkins et al., 2008), the most common amino acid changes in Cluster I leading to RifR were found at amino acids Q469, H482, and S487. At codon Q469, both FL (3/8) and GC (4/4) samples exhibited C-to-A transversions in the first position leading to a Q469K substitution (Table 2; Figure 3). However, FL samples also exhibited two changes at the second position of codon Q469; an A-to-T transversion and an A-to-G transition, leading to the amino acid substitutions Q469L and Q469R, respectively (Table 2; Figure 3). Together, these two mutations accounted for 5/8, or 63% of the total mutations found in FL samples, but were not represented at all in GC samples. At codon H482 were found the majority of RifR mutations in GC samples (40/57 total, or 70%). In comparing the spectrum of RifR mutations between FL and GC samples, it was observed that all of the RifR mutations identified in the GC samples were found to occur at the first position of codon H482, either C-to-G transversions leading to substitution H482Y (33/35, or 94%), or C-to-T transitions leading to H482D (2/35, or 6%). FL samples also exhibited these same mutations (4/6, or 67% for H482Y; 1/6 or 17% for H482D, respectively; Table 2; Figure 3). In addition, a single mutation was identified at the second position of codon H482 only in FL samples; this was an A-to-G transition resulting in an H482R substitution (Table 2; Figure 3). At codon R485, G-to-A transitions were detected at the second position in both FL and GC samples, leading to an R485H amino acid substitution at a slightly higher frequency in GC samples (7/57 total, or 12%) than in FL samples (3/67 total, or 4.5%; Table 2; Figure 3). At codon, S487 was found the majority of RifR mutations in FL samples (47/67 total, or 70%). The largest proportion of RifR mutations in both FL samples (42/47, or 89%) and GC samples (8/10, or 80%) were found to consist of C-to-T transitions at the second position, resulting in the S487F substitution (Table 2 and Figure 3). The remaining mutations at S487 consisted of C-to-T transitions at the second position, resulting in the amino acid substitution S487Y, found in 5/47 (11%) of FL samples and 2/10 (20%) of GC samples, respectively.Double Mutations in FL Samples Sequence analysis of RifR mutations in S. epidermidis rpoB revealed two double mutations in FL samples that were not detected in GC samples (Table 2 and Figure 3). The first resulted in the double amino acid change D472Y + S487C and the second resulted in the double amino acid change E461Q + Q469K. While the single amino acid changes D472Y and Q469K have both been associated with RifR in other species, namely E. coli (Severinov et al., 1993) and Bacillus subtilis (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002), at present it is unclear if single mutations in rpoB leading to the E461Q or S487C substitutions by themselves can confer RifR in S. epidermidis.Distribution of RifR rpoB Mutations by PDFU Examination of Table 2 indicated that in some PDFUs an unusually high number of repeats of the same RifR mutant were found. For example, 12 out of 17 RifR mutants sequenced from FL PDFU-1 were S487F, and 7 out of 10 mutants sequenced from GC PDFU-2 were H482Y (Table 2). These data suggested that some of the populations in both FL and GC samples contained “jackpots,” i.e., cultures in which the progeny of early-arising RifR mutants became over-represented in the final culture (Foster, 2006), which may have skewed the results reported in Table 2 and their interpretation. We therefore re-analyzed the data by counting each type of mutation as either “present” (at least once) or “absent” in each PDFU, the results of which are presented in Table 3. When re-examined in this way, differences in the distribution of RifR mutants in FL vs. GC samples were still apparent. For example, the Q469L mutation was found in three FL PDFUs, but in zero GC PDFUs (Table 3). Conversely, present in nearly all GC PDFUs were the H482Y (6/6) and R485H (5/6) mutations but these mutations were present in only two FL PDFUs (Table 3). In addition, it appeared that the mutation leading to S487F was predominant in both FL (6/6) and GC (5/6) PDFUs, suggesting that mutation at this site was not affected by spaceflight (Table 3). Transition vs. Transversion Mutations in FL and GC Samples As reported above, differences were observed in the location of rpoB mutations in FL vs. GC samples in S. epidermidis RifR mutants. These observations prompted us to examine the nature of nucleotide changes (i.e., transition vs. transversion mutations) in cells cultivated in spaceflight and on the ground. Examination of the distribution of transitions and transversions in S. epidermidis samples revealed the G:A and C:T transitions, and C:A and C:G transversions, were found both in FL and GC samples (Table 3). However, FL samples also exhibited A:G transitions and A:T, G:T, and G:C transversions that were not found in GC samples. Thus, the spectrum of mutational classes (transitions vs. transversions) was also altered in FL vs. GC samples.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The observations that (i) astronaut immune function becomes dysregulated during long-term spaceflight (Guéguinou et al., 2009; Crucian et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015); (ii) certain opportunistic bacteria can upregulate virulence functions in spaceflight (Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015); and (iii) spaceflight can alter the antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria (Lapchine et al., 1986; Tixador et al., 1994) have underscored the importance of studying the causes and consequences of the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the human spaceflight environment. Understanding how microgravity affects the development of not only bacterial antibiotic resistance, but of bacterial growth and metabolism in general, has been difficult to achieve despite substantial interest in the topic (reviewed in Nickerson et al., 2004; Klaus and Howard, 2006; Horneck et al., 2010). This results from the inherent limitations of performing microbiological research in spaceflight, due to infrequent opportunities to access spaceflight habitats, and limitations on the ability to perform large-scale, well-controlled, multireplicate, on-board experiments in the spaceflight environment. In particular, DNA damage, repair, and mutagenesis of bacteria inhabiting the human spaceflight environment remains largely unexplored. Previous studies of antibiotic resistance in microgravity have focused mainly on transient physiologic changes leading to increased or decreased antibiotic susceptibility (Tixador et al., 1985, 1994; Lapchine et al., 1986; Klaus and Howard, 2006). In contrast, the experiments reported here address the heritable emergence of antibiotic resistance in a microbe exposed to spaceflight stress resulting from mutations in genes encoding an important antibiotic target, RNA polymerase. Cell Numbers Achieved during Spaceflight Experiments have been conducted in which the growth of various bacterial species, cultivated under otherwise-matching conditions of hardware, media, inoculation, etc., has been compared in spaceflight vs. GCs. A number of these studies have shown increased final cell density during spaceflight, while others have not observed significant differences between spaceflight and 1 xg conditions (reviewed in Benoit and Klaus, 2007; Horneck et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2013; Rosenzweig et al., 2014). Attempts have been made to explain the phenomenon of bacterial growth to different densities in spaceflight vs. GCs. Benoit and Klaus (2007) suggested that microgravity abolishes convective mixing in liquid culture and that for some unknown reason non-motile cells grow better under these non-mixing conditions (Benoit and Klaus, 2007). According to their model, the movement of motile cells was proposed to mix the liquid medium, thus negating the lack of convective mixing in microgravity and leading to equal growth of motile cells in microgravity and 1 xg (Benoit and Klaus, 2007). However, Kim et al. (2013) recently explored the role of phosphate and/or oxygen availability, carbon source, and motility on the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells in spaceflight vs. GCs. They found that the carbon source used (citrate vs. glucose) did not result in significantly different growth in space vs. ground, but that cultivation under phosphate or oxygen limitation led to increased growth in spaceflight; furthermore, increasing phosphate concentration or aeration resulted in equal growth of cells in space vs. GCs (Kim et al., 2013). In addition, the effect of motility was tested by comparing the growth of the wild-type P. aeruginosa strain with a non-motile mutant harboring a deletion in the motABCD genes encoding the flagellar motor proteins. No significant difference in growth of the strains in space vs. ground was found, failing to support the “motility” hypothesis (Kim et al., 2013). The authors concluded that growth of P. aeruginosa to higher density in spaceflight was largely determined by oxygen and/or phosphate limitation, i.e., culture conditions (Kim et al., 2013). In the experiments described here, we observed that S. epidermidis cells grew to significantly lower densities in FL samples than in GC samples. To the best of our knowledge, bacterial growth to a lower final concentration in spaceflight vs. GC samples has not been reported. The reason for this observation is not known, but our results also do not support the “motility” hypothesis, as S. epidermidis is a non-motile bacterium and grew to lower cell density in FL vs. GC samples, not higher as would be predicted. It is unlikely that availability of nutrients was limiting in these experiments, as the medium used (TSY containing 10% glycerol) is a rich medium. However, differences in diffusion of oxygen/CO2, nutrients, and/or potentially toxic end products in FL vs. GC cultures cannot be ruled out (see Possible Mechanisms). Frequency and Spectra of Mutations to RifR in FL vs. GC Samples Few experiments have been performed to measure both the frequency and spectra of mutations in the same gene of microbes exposed to spaceflight in comparison to GCs, and none using S. epidermidis. In an earlier spaceflight experiment on space station Mir, it was noted that the frequency of mutation to streptomycin resistance (StrR) by B. subtilis spores was not significantly different between FL vs. GC samples, but that the spectrum of StrR mutations in the rpsL gene was found to differ substantially (Yatagai et al., 2000). In the experiments reported here, we observed that S. epidermidis cells behaved somewhat differently, in that they both mutated to RifR with a significantly (24-fold) higher frequency in FL samples than in GC samples, and also displayed differences in their spectra of rpoB mutations. Although direct comparison between these two experiments (each using different organisms, growth conditions, and target genes) would be risky, the common finding of altered mutational spectra in both cases is intriguing and warrants further testing. Comparison of Simulated Microgravity vs. Spaceflight Opportunities for true spaceflight experiments are very limited, and it is impossible on the Earth’s surface to generate a true microgravity environment. In response, investigators have turned to a number of ground-based systems that have been designed to simulate the effects of microgravity (reviewed in Anken, 2013). Among these, clinostats utilizing the rotating wall vessel (RWV) system have become widely used as spaceflight culture analogs (Nickerson et al., 2003; Anken, 2013). In some cases, alterations in bacterial gene expression and virulence have been found to correlate well between clinorotation and actual spaceflight experiments, but not in other cases (reviewed in Rosenzweig et al., 2014). In a previous communication, we measured growth and mutation frequency to RifR in S. epidermidis cells grown in RWVs (Fajardo-Cavazos et al., 2014). In the RWV system, cultures of S. epidermidis grew to significantly higher titers in the vertical (i.e., simulated microgravity) orientation than in the horizontal (i.e., 1 xg) orientation (Fajardo-Cavazos et al., 2014). In stark contrast, in the present study, we found that S. epidermidis cells grew to significantly lower titers in space. We found further discordance when the frequency of mutation to RifR was compared between the spaceflight and RWV studies. In the present study, S. epidermidis FL cultures showed a highly significant increase in mutation to RifR than did GC samples, but in the RWV study, there was no statistical difference in mutation frequencies to RifR in vertical vs. horizontal RWVs (Fajardo-Cavazos et al., 2014). These results lead us to conclude that in the S. epidermidis model system described here, RWV experiments are of little value in predicting or modeling the behavior of this organism under spaceflight conditions. Possible Mechanisms How does cultivation in spaceflight change the frequency and spectrum of rpoB mutations conferring RifR to S. epidermidis? In the experiments reported here, cells were exposed as nearly as possible to matched conditions of hardware, temperature, growth medium, incubation time, and times in stasis both before growth (as air-dried films) and after growth (frozen at –80°C). The two major factors prevailing in spaceflight are decreased gravity and increased ionizing radiation. In orbit, objects inside or attached to the ISS are in free-fall such that the apparent gravitational force they experience is very small (around 1 μg). Microgravity affects a bacterial culture in a number of ways, for example: (i) buoyancy or sedimentation of cells is effectively negated; (ii) the rate of heat and mass transfer via passive convection becomes negligible, and in fact transfer of heat, nutrients, and waste toxins in a static culture becomes dominated by the rate of diffusion; and (iii) liquid behavior at solid surfaces and air–water interfaces is altered in microgravity, as surface tension, viscosity, capillary action, and wetting are removed from gravitational influence (Rosenzweig et al., 2014). The net result is that the same cells cultivated in matched hardware, medium, etc., in FL vs. GC could in fact be residing in two very different environments. Often, an increase in mutation rate can be a response to environmental stress (Galhardo et al., 2007), suggesting that cells in FL samples might be experiencing stress. One way of testing this hypothesis would be to measure global gene expression by performing whole-transcriptome, -proteome, and -metabolome analyses on FL vs. GC cultures, experiments which are currently in progress. At the altitude of ISS orbit (~400 km), the interior of the vehicle is exposed to ionizing radiation consisting mostly of high-energy photons and atomic nuclei (Anonymous, 2002). The S. epidermidis FL samples inhabited the ISS interior for 30 days. Ongoing dosimetry indicates that the dose rate of ionizing radiation inside the ISS during this period amounted to ~13–14 mGy, compared to the global average background radiation dose on Earth of ~0.25 mGy during the same period (Puchalska et al., 2014). This dose is likely an overestimate for the FL samples, as they were also stored within lockers, inside aluminum BRIC canisters and aluminum-and-epoxy PDFUs. Nevertheless, FL samples were almost certainly exposed to a higher ionizing radiation dose than their GC counterparts. In support of the notion that FL samples may have received ionizing radiation hits, we observed two double mutations in rpoB from FL but not from GC samples; interestingly, induction of multiple closely linked mutations are a hallmark of ionizing radiation (Eccles et al., 2011). Broader Implications of the Results In this communication, we report that cultivation of S. epidermidis in the human spaceflight environment of the ISS led to (i) an increase in the mutation frequency to RifR and (ii) alterations in the spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene which result in RifR. The results reported here with S. epidermidis appear to support previous results obtained using B. subtilis on space station Mir (Yatagai et al., 2000), and lead us to propose that exposure of bacteria to the human spaceflight environment can result in an alteration of the location of mutational hotspots within the target genes encoding antibiotic resistance factors. Further experiments using a greater variety of microorganisms will be needed to test this hypothesis. The target gene used in this study, rpoB, encodes the β subunit of the enzyme RNA polymerase, a multisubunit enzyme which makes contacts with every transcribed gene in the bacterial genome. We and others have previously shown that single point mutations in rpoB leading to RifR can profoundly alter the global pattern of gene expression in bacteria and lead to (i) changes in growth, transformation, sporulation and spore resistance properties (Maughan et al., 2004; Moeller et al., 2012); (ii) activation of otherwise cryptic phenotypes (Perkins and Nicholson, 2008); and (iii) artificial triggering of the stringent response (reviewed in Alifano et al., 2015). It will be important to determine how the novel mutational changes in rpoB reported in this communication affect the physiological properties of the resulting mutants, such as their: growth and survival properties on environmental surfaces and in the host; communicability; pathogenic potential; and resistance to multiple antibiotics. Management of microbial antibiotic resistance in confined environments on Earth, such as hospitals, prisons, military barracks, nursing homes, etc. has proven difficult. The results reported here suggest that our Earth-based understanding of the emergence of antibiotic resistance may not be wholly applicable to the human spaceflight environment. Research into the biology of spaceflight has uncovered alterations in crewmember immune function, microbial diversity, and in altered regulation of microbial physiologic responses, leading in some cases to increased virulence and antibiotic resistance (reviewed in Ott et al., 2012). In addition to the above factors, elucidation of the spaceflight-specific genetic mechanisms leading to the emergence of antibiotic resistance is needed to inform mitigation strategies for crew health and mission success. As more humans embark on longer sojourns into space, the more important these considerations will become.",

Copyright notice ID: 4923109 PMID: 27446039 Abstract Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus are persistent inhabitants of human spaceflight habitats and represent potential opportunistic pathogens. The effect of the human spaceflight environment on the growth and the frequency of mutations to antibiotic resistance in the model organism Staphylococcus epidermidis strain ATCC12228 was investigated. Six cultures of the test organism were cultivated in biological research in canisters–Petri dish fixation units for 122 h on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the SpaceX-3 resupply mission. Asynchronous ground controls (GCs) consisted of identical sets of cultures cultivated for 122 h in the ISS Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center. S. epidermidis exhibited significantly lower viable counts but significantly higher frequencies of mutation to rifampicin (Rif) resistance in space vs. GC cultures. The spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene leading to RifR was altered in S. epidermidis isolates cultivated in the ISS compared to GCs. The results suggest that the human spaceflight environment induces unique physiologic stresses on growing bacterial cells leading to changes in mutagenic potential. Keywords: antibiotic resistance, mutation, rpoB, rifampicin, Staphylococcus epidermidis, space flightIntroduction Planning is currently underway for future long-duration missions through interplanetary space to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars (NASA, 2015). Both the National Research Council (NRC) and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) have assigned a high priority to studies aimed at better understanding astronaut health risks during space exploration; furthermore, these agencies have recognized the International Space Station (ISS) as the best available platform to conduct research activities to address these challenges (International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG), 2013; National Research Council [NRC], 2014). Studies conducted during short- and medium-duration missions (from a few days up to ~1 year) in vehicles such as Spacelab, Soyuz, Shuttle, Mir, and ISS have provided a wealth of information concerning astronaut health and function in the spaceflight environment of low-Earth orbit (LEO; Taylor, 2015). Based on the knowledge gained from these missions, NASA has developed successful risk mitigation strategies. However, long-duration missions (greater than 1 year) into interplanetary space are more likely to expose astronauts to new and higher risks to their health and performance than excursions to LEO, primarily due to: (i) chronic exposure to microgravity; (ii) increased exposure to ionizing radiation from solar and galactic sources; and (iii) extreme confinement and isolation (Reitz, 2008; NRC, 2011; Zeitlin et al., 2013; Taylor, 2015). One particular concern for planners of long-duration missions is the possibility of infectious disease (Scott-Conner et al., 2015; Taylor, 2015). Prolonged exposure to the stresses of spaceflight can lead to dysregulation of astronauts’ immune systems, thus increasing their susceptibility to infectious disease (Crucian et al., 2009; Guéguinou et al., 2009; Taylor, 2015). To minimize the possibility of bringing infectious disease agents onboard, pre-launch mitigation protocols are in place such as screening astronauts for certain microbes and irradiation of food (NASA, 2010). However, the essential nature of the human microbiome (Cho and Blaser, 2012) renders it impossible to remove all potentially infectious microorganisms from astronauts. Indeed, deterioration of astronauts’ immune systems in space has led to increased reactivation of latent viral infections by Varicella–Zoster, Epstein–Barr, and Cytomegalovirus during 12–16 day Shuttle flights (Mehta et al., 2014). Opportunistic bacterial infections of the urinary tract, upper respiratory tract, and subcutaneous tissue have been documented from Shuttle missions STS-1 to STS-108 (Sams, 2009), and conjunctivitis, respiratory tract, and dental infections were documented among long-term inhabitants of space station Mir (Ball and Evans, 2001). Numerous studies have been conducted to understand how bacteria themselves respond to the human spaceflight environment, with particular regard to the possibility of their enhanced pathogenic potential or resistance to antimicrobial treatments [reviewed extensively in Rosenzweig et al. (2014)]. In some spaceflight experiments, it has been observed that spaceflight can lead to enhanced virulence in some bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but not in others (S. typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes; note: in S. typhimurium, both cases have been observed in different spaceflight experiments; reviewed in Rosenzweig et al., 2014). Taken together, the data suggest that the combined phenomena of altered astronaut immunity and heightened virulence of some microbes in the spaceflight environment might lead to an increased incidence of astronaut infections by some opportunistic pathogens during extended missions (Klaus and Howard, 2006). Space stations start out as basically clean environments, but upon habitation, they are rapidly colonized by numerous environmental and astronaut-associated species of microorganisms, which proceed to adapt and evolve in response to selective pressures unique to the spaceflight environment (Novikova, 2004; van Tongeren et al., 2007). A number of opportunistic pathogens have been isolated from space station crew quarters and from astronauts, including both Gram-positive genera (Bacillus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) and Gram-negative genera (Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Flavobacterium, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Morganella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Serratia, Stenotrophomonas, and Yersinia; Ilyin, 2005; Klaus and Howard, 2006). From studies of astronauts on space stations Mir and ISS, it was documented that the microbial diversity of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was lowered during spaceflight, while the proportion of opportunistic pathogens increased. In addition, extensive exchange of microbial flora of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts has been documented among astronauts sharing confined space habitats [reviewed in Taylor and Sommer (2005)]. Recent microbial monitoring of the ISS environment revealed that Bacillus and Staphylococcus spp., are the most ubiquitous organisms cultured from the ISS, being especially abundant in samples taken from crew quarters, vacuum debris, and HEPA filters (Venkateswaran et al., 2014; Checinska et al., 2015). Not surprisingly, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequently encountered organism in the ISS microbiome, due to its close association with humans as a skin commensal (Venkateswaran et al., 2014). As on Earth, antibiotics are the predominant treatment of choice for bacterial infections on human spaceflight missions. Knowledge about the efficacy of antimicrobial interventions to treat infections during spaceflight is limited, given the difficulty to assess the interplay between pharmacokinetics of antibiotics or the physiologies of host and microbiome, both of which are altered in the spaceflight environment (Wotring, 2012; Taylor, 2015). Decreased susceptibility of microbes to antibiotics has been observed in the space environment during experiments performed on Salyut 7 (Tixador et al., 1985) and the Space Shuttles Challenger (Lapchine et al., 1986) and Discovery (Tixador et al., 1994). Mutation is a common mechanism by which bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. A body of evidence indicates that the spectrum of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance can be altered by the environment to which microbes are exposed (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002; Nicholson and Park, 2015), including the spaceflight environment (Yatagai et al., 2000). In the experiments described here, we chose to study mutations leading to resistance to the antibiotic rifampcin (Rif), because: (i) Rif is a clinically relevant antibiotic used singly and in combination to treat a wide variety of infections; and (ii) RifR mutations are easily identified by nucleotide sequencing, as they reside within small regions of the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNA polymerase (Severinov et al., 1993). Taken together, the above observations indicate that the possibility must be considered of antibiotic-resistant strains emerging, and potentially becoming dominant types, in the microbiomes of crew members. Therefore, to explore the development of antibiotic resistance in a potential opportunistic pathogen during long-term human habitation in space, the present communication describes experiments using the biological research in canisters (BRIC) hardware in which growth of S. epidermidis, as well as the frequency and spectrum of mutation to RifR, were measured after spaceflight on the ISS and compared to asynchronous ground controls (GCs).Materials and Methods Bacterial Strain, Media, and Growth Conditions The strain used was S. epidermidis strain ATCC12228 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA. Medium used throughout was trypticase soy yeast extract (TSY) medium consisting of (g/L): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5; yeast extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; and final pH 7. For semisolid plates, agar was added to TSY at 15.0 g/L. As appropriate, the antibiotic rifampicin (Rif; Sigma–Aldrich) was added to TSY at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL.Sample Preparation Staphylococcus epidermidis cells were prepared by overnight growth in TSY liquid medium and a calibration curve was constructed relating Optical Density at 660 nm (OD660) to viable cell titer. Overnight cultures were diluted in TSY to a working concentration of 108 CFU per mL prior to use. Aliquots of 0.1 mL (~107 CFU) of the suspension were applied to the bottoms of sterile 60-mm diameter Petri dishes (Falcon cat. no. 1007) and air-dried for 48–72 h at room temperature prior to use.BRIC Spaceflight Hardware The experiments described here utilized BRIC spaceflight hardware, which has been described in detail previously (Paul et al., 2012). BRIC canisters hold six 60-mm diameter Petri dish bottom halves in small subcompartments called Petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Each PDFU allows for injection of medium, referred to as actuation, to initiate bacterial growth. For flight (FL) experiments, one BRIC canister was used containing six PDFUs. Immediately, adjacent to the FL canister was deployed a HOBO® temperature data logger (Onset Computer Co., Bourne, MA, USA). Post-flight asynchronous GC experiments were conducted using the same hardware and configuration as in the FL experiment. Each PDFU was loaded with a Petri dish containing air-dried cells, and 13 mL of sterile TSY medium was loaded into a separate reservoir. To prevent contamination, all reagents and equipment used were sterilized prior to use and PDFUs were assembled using aseptic technique within a biological containment hood.Spaceflight Timeline The BRIC–PDFU payload described above was the 18th BRIC mission to space, and was designated BRIC-18. The BRIC-18 hardware payload was launched on the third SpaceX cargo resupply mission to the ISS (SpaceX-3) on April 18, 2014, using the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule configuration. The Dragon capsule docked with the ISS on April 21, 2014. The BRIC canister was transferred to the ISS on April 22, 2014 and stowed in the US laboratory module. Actuation of the PDFUs was performed on April 30, 2014 at 10:08 EDT (Figure 1A) and samples were incubated at ISS ambient temperature (Figure 1B) until May 5, 2014 at 12:04 PM EDT, resulting in a total incubation time of 122 h. Growth was terminated by transfer of the BRIC canister to the onboard −80°C MELFI freezer. Samples were returned to Earth in the Dragon capsule on May 18, 2014 and were maintained in the frozen state until return to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for de-integration and further processing. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab (A) Actuation of BRIC-18 canister by astronaut Rick Mastracchio aboard the ISS. (B) Temperature data from BRIC-18 flight (FL; blue line) and ground control (GC; green line) samples. Actuation time is denoted by the upward arrow and termination of experiment by moving to −80°C freezer is denoted by the downward arrow.Ground Control Timeline Asynchronous GC experiments were performed in a BRIC canister according to the timeline determined during the FL experiment. Samples were incubated in the KSC ISS Environmental Simulation Chamber following the temperature regime recorded during flight (Figure 1B), and growth was terminated by transfer to a −80°C freezer, where samples were stored until further processing.Post-Experiment Sample Processing Both FL and GC BRIC canisters were transferred from storage at −80°C to a +4°C refrigerator and allowed to thaw overnight. Petri dishes were removed from PDFUs and cells were resuspended using sterile disposable rubber spatulas. Resuspended cultures were transferred to sterile 50-mL conical centrifuge tubes, and the total volume recovered was measured. For viable counts, aliquots from cultures were diluted serially 10-fold in TSY medium, dilutions plated on TSY, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h to obtain CFU/mL. To obtain the total CFU per PDFU, the CFU/mL were multiplied by the volume of liquid recovered. To select for RifR mutants, cultures were concentrated by centrifugation, plated without dilution onto TSY + Rif plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h. The frequency of mutation to RifR was calculated by dividing the total number of RifR mutants by the total number of viable cells from each culture. Individual RifR mutants were streak-purified on TSY + Rif plates and processed for DNA sequencing.DNA Sequencing and Analyses Primers used for PCR amplification of two RifR regions of the S. epidermidis rpoB gene are listed in Table 1. The corresponding rpoB regions were amplified by PCR directly from cells as previously described (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002) and their nucleotide sequences determined at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR). Multiple rpoB sequences were aligned using the online Clustal Omega server1 to identify the position of mutations relative to the wild-type rpoB sequence obtained in parallel from S. epidermidis ATCC12228.

The average temperature recorded during the growth period in FL was 25.1 ± 0.12°C until 107 h, at which time the immediately adjacent FL HOBO unit malfunctioned for the duration of the experiment (Figure 1B). However, the HOBO malfunction did not affect the course of the FL experiment, as other HOBO units in nearby BRIC canisters functioned correctly and confirmed a nominal temperature profile (data not shown). The average temperature in the GC experiment was 24.8 ± 0.16°C, differing from the FL experiment by only 0.3°C. The HOBO unit in the GC experiment performed nominally for the entire 122 h duration of the experiment (Figure 1B). Staphylococcus epidermidis Growth and Frequency of Mutation to RifR in FL vs. GC Viable counts of the cultures in all six PDFUs were determined for both FL and GC samples (Figure 2A). All S. epidermidis cultures grew to high titers in both FL and GC experiments, and viable counts were significantly higher in the GC cultures (Figure 2A). To determine the frequency of mutation to RifR, cells from the FL and GC cultures were concentrated by centrifugation and plated onto TSY + Rif. FL cultures of S. epidermidis exhibited a 24-fold higher frequency of mutation to RifR than did GC cultures, and this difference was found to be highly significant (Figure 2B). FIGURE 2.

The data are presented in Tables 2 and 3 and summarized graphically in Figure 3. Examination of the data revealed notable differences in the mutational spectrum within rpoB between the FL and GC samples. Table 2.

The centerline depicts the wild-type RpoB amino acid sequence with coordinates. The lines above and below the amino acid sequence represent the wild-type DNA sequence of rpoB. Mutations found in RifR mutants obtained from FL and GC are denoted, as are the resulting deduced amino acid changes. Two double mutations found in the FL samples are indicated by stippled and shaded backgrounds. N-Cluster No mutations were detected in the N-cluster of the S. epidermidis rpoB gene in either the FL or GC samples.Cluster I All of the RifR mutations identified in both FL and GC samples of S. epidermidis were found to occur in Cluster I (Table 2; Figure 3). In agreement with previous reports (Severinov et al., 1993; Campbell et al., 2001; Nicholson and Maughan, 2002; Perkins et al., 2008), the most common amino acid changes in Cluster I leading to RifR were found at amino acids Q469, H482, and S487. At codon Q469, both FL (3/8) and GC (4/4) samples exhibited C-to-A transversions in the first position leading to a Q469K substitution (Table 2; Figure 3). However, FL samples also exhibited two changes at the second position of codon Q469; an A-to-T transversion and an A-to-G transition, leading to the amino acid substitutions Q469L and Q469R, respectively (Table 2; Figure 3). Together, these two mutations accounted for 5/8, or 63% of the total mutations found in FL samples, but were not represented at all in GC samples. At codon H482 were found the majority of RifR mutations in GC samples (40/57 total, or 70%). In comparing the spectrum of RifR mutations between FL and GC samples, it was observed that all of the RifR mutations identified in the GC samples were found to occur at the first position of codon H482, either C-to-G transversions leading to substitution H482Y (33/35, or 94%), or C-to-T transitions leading to H482D (2/35, or 6%). FL samples also exhibited these same mutations (4/6, or 67% for H482Y; 1/6 or 17% for H482D, respectively; Table 2; Figure 3). In addition, a single mutation was identified at the second position of codon H482 only in FL samples; this was an A-to-G transition resulting in an H482R substitution (Table 2; Figure 3). At codon R485, G-to-A transitions were detected at the second position in both FL and GC samples, leading to an R485H amino acid substitution at a slightly higher frequency in GC samples (7/57 total, or 12%) than in FL samples (3/67 total, or 4.5%; Table 2; Figure 3). At codon, S487 was found the majority of RifR mutations in FL samples (47/67 total, or 70%). The largest proportion of RifR mutations in both FL samples (42/47, or 89%) and GC samples (8/10, or 80%) were found to consist of C-to-T transitions at the second position, resulting in the S487F substitution (Table 2 and Figure 3). The remaining mutations at S487 consisted of C-to-T transitions at the second position, resulting in the amino acid substitution S487Y, found in 5/47 (11%) of FL samples and 2/10 (20%) of GC samples, respectively.Double Mutations in FL Samples Sequence analysis of RifR mutations in S. epidermidis rpoB revealed two double mutations in FL samples that were not detected in GC samples (Table 2 and Figure 3). The first resulted in the double amino acid change D472Y + S487C and the second resulted in the double amino acid change E461Q + Q469K. While the single amino acid changes D472Y and Q469K have both been associated with RifR in other species, namely E. coli (Severinov et al., 1993) and Bacillus subtilis (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002), at present it is unclear if single mutations in rpoB leading to the E461Q or S487C substitutions by themselves can confer RifR in S. epidermidis.Distribution of RifR rpoB Mutations by PDFU Examination of Table 2 indicated that in some PDFUs an unusually high number of repeats of the same RifR mutant were found. For example, 12 out of 17 RifR mutants sequenced from FL PDFU-1 were S487F, and 7 out of 10 mutants sequenced from GC PDFU-2 were H482Y (Table 2). These data suggested that some of the populations in both FL and GC samples contained “jackpots,” i.e., cultures in which the progeny of early-arising RifR mutants became over-represented in the final culture (Foster, 2006), which may have skewed the results reported in Table 2 and their interpretation. We therefore re-analyzed the data by counting each type of mutation as either “present” (at least once) or “absent” in each PDFU, the results of which are presented in Table 3. When re-examined in this way, differences in the distribution of RifR mutants in FL vs. GC samples were still apparent. For example, the Q469L mutation was found in three FL PDFUs, but in zero GC PDFUs (Table 3). Conversely, present in nearly all GC PDFUs were the H482Y (6/6) and R485H (5/6) mutations but these mutations were present in only two FL PDFUs (Table 3). In addition, it appeared that the mutation leading to S487F was predominant in both FL (6/6) and GC (5/6) PDFUs, suggesting that mutation at this site was not affected by spaceflight (Table 3).Transition vs. Transversion Mutations in FL and GC Samples As reported above, differences were observed in the location of rpoB mutations in FL vs. GC samples in S. epidermidis RifR mutants. These observations prompted us to examine the nature of nucleotide changes (i.e., transition vs. transversion mutations) in cells cultivated in spaceflight and on the ground. Examination of the distribution of transitions and transversions in S. epidermidis samples revealed the G:A and C:T transitions, and C:A and C:G transversions, were found both in FL and GC samples (Table 3). However, FL samples also exhibited A:G transitions and A:T, G:T, and G:C transversions that were not found in GC samples. Thus, the spectrum of mutational classes (transitions vs. transversions) was also altered in FL vs. GC samples.Discussion The observations that (i) astronaut immune function becomes dysregulated during long-term spaceflight (Guéguinou et al., 2009; Crucian et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015); (ii) certain opportunistic bacteria can upregulate virulence functions in spaceflight (Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015); and (iii) spaceflight can alter the antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria (Lapchine et al., 1986; Tixador et al., 1994) have underscored the importance of studying the causes and consequences of the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the human spaceflight environment. Understanding how microgravity affects the development of not only bacterial antibiotic resistance, but of bacterial growth and metabolism in general, has been difficult to achieve despite substantial interest in the topic (reviewed in Nickerson et al., 2004; Klaus and Howard, 2006; Horneck et al., 2010). This results from the inherent limitations of performing microbiological research in spaceflight, due to infrequent opportunities to access spaceflight habitats, and limitations on the ability to perform large-scale, well-controlled, multireplicate, on-board experiments in the spaceflight environment. In particular, DNA damage, repair, and mutagenesis of bacteria inhabiting the human spaceflight environment remains largely unexplored. Previous studies of antibiotic resistance in microgravity have focused mainly on transient physiologic changes leading to increased or decreased antibiotic susceptibility (Tixador et al., 1985, 1994; Lapchine et al., 1986; Klaus and Howard, 2006). In contrast, the experiments reported here address the heritable emergence of antibiotic resistance in a microbe exposed to spaceflight stress resulting from mutations in genes encoding an important antibiotic target, RNA polymerase. Cell Numbers Achieved during Spaceflight Experiments have been conducted in which the growth of various bacterial species, cultivated under otherwise-matching conditions of hardware, media, inoculation, etc., has been compared in spaceflight vs. GCs. A number of these studies have shown increased final cell density during spaceflight, while others have not observed significant differences between spaceflight and 1 xg conditions (reviewed in Benoit and Klaus, 2007; Horneck et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2013; Rosenzweig et al., 2014). Attempts have been made to explain the phenomenon of bacterial growth to different densities in spaceflight vs. GCs. Benoit and Klaus (2007) suggested that microgravity abolishes convective mixing in liquid culture and that for some unknown reason non-motile cells grow better under these non-mixing conditions (Benoit and Klaus, 2007). According to their model, the movement of motile cells was proposed to mix the liquid medium, thus negating the lack of convective mixing in microgravity and leading to equal growth of motile cells in microgravity and 1 xg (Benoit and Klaus, 2007). However, Kim et al. (2013) recently explored the role of phosphate and/or oxygen availability, carbon source, and motility on the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells in spaceflight vs. GCs. They found that the carbon source used (citrate vs. glucose) did not result in significantly different growth in space vs. ground, but that cultivation under phosphate or oxygen limitation led to increased growth in spaceflight; furthermore, increasing phosphate concentration or aeration resulted in equal growth of cells in space vs. GCs (Kim et al., 2013). In addition, the effect of motility was tested by comparing the growth of the wild-type P. aeruginosa strain with a non-motile mutant harboring a deletion in the motABCD genes encoding the flagellar motor proteins. No significant difference in growth of the strains in space vs. ground was found, failing to support the “motility” hypothesis (Kim et al., 2013). The authors concluded that growth of P. aeruginosa to higher density in spaceflight was largely determined by oxygen and/or phosphate limitation, i.e., culture conditions (Kim et al., 2013). In the experiments described here, we observed that S. epidermidis cells grew to significantly lower densities in FL samples than in GC samples. To the best of our knowledge, bacterial growth to a lower final concentration in spaceflight vs. GC samples has not been reported. The reason for this observation is not known, but our results also do not support the “motility” hypothesis, as S. epidermidis is a non-motile bacterium and grew to lower cell density in FL vs. GC samples, not higher as would be predicted. It is unlikely that availability of nutrients was limiting in these experiments, as the medium used (TSY containing 10% glycerol) is a rich medium. However, differences in diffusion of oxygen/CO2, nutrients, and/or potentially toxic end products in FL vs. GC cultures cannot be ruled out (see Possible Mechanisms).Frequency and Spectra of Mutations to RifR in FL vs. GC Samples Few experiments have been performed to measure both the frequency and spectra of mutations in the same gene of microbes exposed to spaceflight in comparison to GCs, and none using S. epidermidis. In an earlier spaceflight experiment on space station Mir, it was noted that the frequency of mutation to streptomycin resistance (StrR) by B. subtilis spores was not significantly different between FL vs. GC samples, but that the spectrum of StrR mutations in the rpsL gene was found to differ substantially (Yatagai et al., 2000). In the experiments reported here, we observed that S. epidermidis cells behaved somewhat differently, in that they both mutated to RifR with a significantly (24-fold) higher frequency in FL samples than in GC samples, and also displayed differences in their spectra of rpoB mutations. Although direct comparison between these two experiments (each using different organisms, growth conditions, and target genes) would be risky, the common finding of altered mutational spectra in both cases is intriguing and warrants further testing.Comparison of Simulated Microgravity vs. Spaceflight Opportunities for true spaceflight experiments are very limited, and it is impossible on the Earth’s surface to generate a true microgravity environment. In response, investigators have turned to a number of ground-based systems that have been designed to simulate the effects of microgravity (reviewed in Anken, 2013). Among these, clinostats utilizing the rotating wall vessel (RWV) system have become widely used as spaceflight culture analogs (Nickerson et al., 2003; Anken, 2013). In some cases, alterations in bacterial gene expression and virulence have been found to correlate well between clinorotation and actual spaceflight experiments, but not in other cases (reviewed in Rosenzweig et al., 2014). In a previous communication, we measured growth and mutation frequency to RifR in S. epidermidis cells grown in RWVs (Fajardo-Cavazos et al., 2014). In the RWV system, cultures of S. epidermidis grew to significantly higher titers in the vertical (i.e., simulated microgravity) orientation than in the horizontal (i.e., 1 xg) orientation (Fajardo-Cavazos et al., 2014). In stark contrast, in the present study, we found that S. epidermidis cells grew to significantly lower titers in space. We found further discordance when the frequency of mutation to RifR was compared between the spaceflight and RWV studies. In the present study, S. epidermidis FL cultures showed a highly significant increase in mutation to RifR than did GC samples, but in the RWV study, there was no statistical difference in mutation frequencies to RifR in vertical vs. horizontal RWVs (Fajardo-Cavazos et al., 2014). These results lead us to conclude that in the S. epidermidis model system described here, RWV experiments are of little value in predicting or modeling the behavior of this organism under spaceflight conditions.Possible Mechanisms How does cultivation in spaceflight change the frequency and spectrum of rpoB mutations conferring RifR to S. epidermidis? In the experiments reported here, cells were exposed as nearly as possible to matched conditions of hardware, temperature, growth medium, incubation time, and times in stasis both before growth (as air-dried films) and after growth (frozen at –80°C). The two major factors prevailing in spaceflight are decreased gravity and increased ionizing radiation. In orbit, objects inside or attached to the ISS are in free-fall such that the apparent gravitational force they experience is very small (around 1 μg). Microgravity affects a bacterial culture in a number of ways, for example: (i) buoyancy or sedimentation of cells is effectively negated; (ii) the rate of heat and mass transfer via passive convection becomes negligible, and in fact transfer of heat, nutrients, and waste toxins in a static culture becomes dominated by the rate of diffusion; and (iii) liquid behavior at solid surfaces and air–water interfaces is altered in microgravity, as surface tension, viscosity, capillary action, and wetting are removed from gravitational influence (Rosenzweig et al., 2014). The net result is that the same cells cultivated in matched hardware, medium, etc., in FL vs. GC could in fact be residing in two very different environments. Often, an increase in mutation rate can be a response to environmental stress (Galhardo et al., 2007), suggesting that cells in FL samples might be experiencing stress. One way of testing this hypothesis would be to measure global gene expression by performing whole-transcriptome, -proteome, and -metabolome analyses on FL vs. GC cultures, experiments which are currently in progress. At the altitude of ISS orbit (~400 km), the interior of the vehicle is exposed to ionizing radiation consisting mostly of high-energy photons and atomic nuclei (Anonymous, 2002). The S. epidermidis FL samples inhabited the ISS interior for 30 days. Ongoing dosimetry indicates that the dose rate of ionizing radiation inside the ISS during this period amounted to ~13–14 mGy, compared to the global average background radiation dose on Earth of ~0.25 mGy during the same period (Puchalska et al., 2014). This dose is likely an overestimate for the FL samples, as they were also stored within lockers, inside aluminum BRIC canisters and aluminum-and-epoxy PDFUs. Nevertheless, FL samples were almost certainly exposed to a higher ionizing radiation dose than their GC counterparts. In support of the notion that FL samples may have received ionizing radiation hits, we observed two double mutations in rpoB from FL but not from GC samples; interestingly, induction of multiple closely linked mutations are a hallmark of ionizing radiation (Eccles et al., 2011).Broader Implications of the Results In this communication, we report that cultivation of S. epidermidis in the human spaceflight environment of the ISS led to (i) an increase in the mutation frequency to RifR and (ii) alterations in the spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene which result in RifR. The results reported here with S. epidermidis appear to support previous results obtained using B. subtilis on space station Mir (Yatagai et al., 2000), and lead us to propose that exposure of bacteria to the human spaceflight environment can result in an alteration of the location of mutational hotspots within the target genes encoding antibiotic resistance factors. Further experiments using a greater variety of microorganisms will be needed to test this hypothesis. The target gene used in this study, rpoB, encodes the β subunit of the enzyme RNA polymerase, a multisubunit enzyme which makes contacts with every transcribed gene in the bacterial genome. We and others have previously shown that single point mutations in rpoB leading to RifR can profoundly alter the global pattern of gene expression in bacteria and lead to (i) changes in growth, transformation, sporulation and spore resistance properties (Maughan et al., 2004; Moeller et al., 2012); (ii) activation of otherwise cryptic phenotypes (Perkins and Nicholson, 2008); and (iii) artificial triggering of the stringent response (reviewed in Alifano et al., 2015). It will be important to determine how the novel mutational changes in rpoB reported in this communication affect the physiological properties of the resulting mutants, such as their: growth and survival properties on environmental surfaces and in the host; communicability; pathogenic potential; and resistance to multiple antibiotics. Management of microbial antibiotic resistance in confined environments on Earth, such as hospitals, prisons, military barracks, nursing homes, etc. has proven difficult. The results reported here suggest that our Earth-based understanding of the emergence of antibiotic resistance may not be wholly applicable to the human spaceflight environment. Research into the biology of spaceflight has uncovered alterations in crewmember immune function, microbial diversity, and in altered regulation of microbial physiologic responses, leading in some cases to increased virulence and antibiotic resistance (reviewed in Ott et al., 2012). In addition to the above factors, elucidation of the spaceflight-specific genetic mechanisms leading to the emergence of antibiotic resistance is needed to inform mitigation strategies for crew health and mission success. As more humans embark on longer sojourns into space, the more important these considerations will become.Author Contributions PF-C and WN both contributed to the intellectual content, design and execution of the experiments, interpretation of the data, and writing of the manuscript, and are accountable for all aspects of the work described herein.Conflict of Interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.Acknowledgments We thank Howard Levine, David Flowers, Howard Smith, and David Tomko of NASA for valuable programmatic and scientific support, and the excellent technical assistance of Naixin Zhang and the BRIC-18 Payload Development Team (Dinah Dimapilis, Jennifer Horton, Donald Houze, Michele Koralewicz, Susan Manning-Roach, Jodi Sills, and Terry Tullis).Funding.

    "abstract": "Simple Summary As global temperatures rise due to climate change, understanding how bacteria respond to heat is essential. Bacteria are critical to ecosystems, helping recycle nutrients, break down organic matter, and support plant growth. If they struggle to adapt to warmer conditions, the effects could ripple through ecosystems. Our study tested whether Bacillus bacteria, common in soil and water, could adapt to gradual temperature increases. We exposed seven strains from two groups to experimental evolution under increasing warming conditions, expecting them to evolve heat tolerance. Although some bacteria showed small improvements in heat tolerance, neither group could evolve to grow well at temperatures just three degrees Celsius above their natural range. This is concerning, as climate change could raise global temperatures by 2–4 °C, which could push these bacteria beyond their limits. We also found that c-di-AMP, a molecule that helps regulate potassium levels in cells, was involved in temperature tolerance. These findings highlight the vulnerability of essential bacteria to climate change and underscore the need for further research to predict and mitigate its impacts on ecosystems. Keywords: experimental evolution, critical high temperature, phenotypic plasticity, norms of reaction to temperature, convergent evolution, c-di-AMP, upper thermal limit, evolutionary rescue, thermal plasticity, thermal niche",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Bacteria are often regarded as highly adaptable to extreme environmental changes, including rising temperatures driven by global warming. However, this perception oversimplifies the complexity of bacterial adaptation and does not account for the millions of years it has taken for the diversity of bacteria to adapt to particular niches. This highlights that their adaptive capacity is deeply rooted in long evolutionary processes. Understanding bacterial responses to heat stress is critical, given their central role in nutrient cycling and ecosystem stability, especially as global temperatures are projected to increase by 2 to 4 °C [1,2]. The impact of rising temperatures extends beyond bacterial physiology, with significant consequences for ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles; for example, elevated ocean temperatures alter nitrogen-fixing microbial populations, threatening the nitrogen cycle in coral reefs [3]. Similarly, warming freshwater ecosystems decreases bacterial diversity, disrupting ecological balance [2]. Rising temperatures are also linked to the spread of antibiotic resistance [4,5] and increased abundance of pathogens like Vibrio cholerae in coastal waters [6]. These examples underscore the urgency of understanding bacterial thermal adaptation in the context of global climate change. Phenotypic plasticity—the ability of organisms to adjust their traits in response to changing environmental conditions [7,8]—allows species to buffer against environmental fluctuations. This adaptability can extend an organism’s ecological range, potentially leading to genetic assimilation, where initially flexible traits become genetically stabilized [9]. Nevertheless, plasticity has inherent limitations and costs, especially under sustained stress [10]. Reaction norms, which describe how a genotype’s phenotype changes across environmental gradients, are valuable tools for assessing thermal limits and understanding adaptive strategies. We can learn about a given organism’s thermal niche through reaction norms (Wolterek, 1909 [11], cited by Stearns [12]). Mesophilic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli [13] and some Bacillus species [14], typically thrive between 27 °C and 40 °C. When exposed to higher temperatures, mesophilic bacteria activate a heat-shock response (HSR), which involves the rapid production of heat-shock proteins that stabilize cellular components and temporarily protect against heat stress [15,16]. However, these adaptations are generally short-lived and insufficient for prolonged survival under extreme temperatures. Escherichia coli, as a well-established model organism, has been extensively studied for its physiological responses to thermal stress. Unlike thermal tolerance, which temporarily protects cells from heat damage by activating heat-shock proteins [17], thermal adaptation requires genetic changes that can withstand and sustain growth at higher temperatures beyond the initial threshold [18]. Experimental evolution is a powerful tool for gaining insights into the capacity of bacteria to adapt to specific biotic and abiotic challenges and understanding the types of mutations that shape or enable such adaptations to changing environments [18,19]. It allows researchers to address a key question in evolutionary biology: whether bacteria can evolve similar phenotypic outcomes through the same or different genetic mechanisms—a phenomenon known as convergent evolution [20,21]. Convergent evolution can manifest in multiple ways, including traits that arise via a conserved genetic mechanism within a clade or through distinct mechanistic bases even among closely related species. Previous experiments have documented a rapid adaptive response of E. coli to high temperatures [22], with evidence that the genetic response can be diverse [23]. Similarly, Tenaillon et al. [24] took a whole-genome approach to estimate the extent of evolutionary convergence that occurs during adaptation in 115 populations of E. coli at a high temperature of 42.2 °C, analyzing the overall genetic basis of adaptation. Their findings highlighted convergence among genes, with the most mutated gene being rpoB, along with proteins that regulate the rpoS stress response (RSS). Although numerous studies have explored the ability of E. coli to evolve at different temperatures [25], few studies have aimed to evolve bacteria to expand their thermal niche. In this context, Murata et al. [26] subjected an E. coli strain to 43 °C and identified 51 genes crucial for thermotolerance, highlighting the diverse genetic pathways involved in developing heat tolerance. Murata introduced the term “critically high temperatures” (CHT) to describe temperatures beyond the thermal limit. Bennett and Lenski [13] sought to isolate evolved lines capable of surpassing the upper thermal limit and found that this limit did not significantly increase in any of the derived lines, even those that evolved at 41–42 °C. Exposure to 44 °C proved lethal, except for one thermotolerant mutant, which managed to grow at 44 °C [27]. Mongold et al. [28] further investigated evolutionary adaptation to what they termed a “lethal thermal environment” by directly shifting evolution to 44 °C. Their findings revealed that three thermotolerant mutants were derived from two progenitor lines that had previously adapted to 41–42 °C, suggesting that these lines extended their upper thermal limit in a stepwise manner relative to their progenitors. Additionally, they noted that not all evolved lines exhibited trade-offs, such as a loss of fitness at lower temperatures. Bacillus strains are particularly important to study in the context of prolonged survival at temperatures exceeding their niche range because they are ubiquitous and ecologically significant, playing key roles in decomposing organic matter and nutrient cycling. Although Bacillus can form heat-tolerant spores that remain dormant for decades, their heterotrophic functions occur only in a vegetative state. Therefore, understanding whether Bacillus can evolve more heat-tolerant vegetative cells is crucial for predicting how these bacteria will respond to global warming. Recent research has shown that wild Bacillus strains exhibit considerable variation in thermal tolerance, influenced by genetic background [14], emphasizing that temperature is a critical factor affecting bacterial growth and survival. Despite extensive research on acute bacterial responses, the long-term evolution of bacterial thermotolerance and the upper thermal limits they can achieve remain poorly understood and research has not been conducted on Bacillus lineages. This study addresses this knowledge gap by investigating whether wild Bacillus strains from two distinct lineages can evolve heat tolerance in their vegetative cells through experimental evolution. We aim to determine whether gradual temperature increases enable these bacteria to develop the plasticity needed to survive projected global temperature rises of 2 to 4 °C and to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying their adaptations. By focusing on different lineages and genetic backgrounds, our research explores the constraints and potential pathways for bacterial adaptation to extreme heat, providing insights into their evolutionary resilience and broader ecosystem impacts. The main conclusions of this work are as follows: 1. The observed lineage-specific outcomes and convergence within strains underscore the critical role of genetic background in shaping adaptive responses. B. cereus and B. subtilis have different plasticity and B. cereus lineages, contrary to those of B. subtilis, and were not able to increase thermal tolerance relative to ancestral lines. Only one evolved B. subtilis line successfully extended its thermal niche. 2. Tolerance to higher temperatures was observed in B. subtilis lines that evolved constantly at 37 °C, indicating a metabolic adjustment driven by continuous growth conditions and the growth medium rather than selective pressure from increased temperatures. 3. Convergent mutations in genes regulating c-di-AMP synthesis uncover, for the first time, its critical role in thermal tolerance. This discovery links molecular mechanisms to thermal adaptation across lineages. 4. Finally, our findings warn about bacteria’s inability to evolve significant thermal tolerance, even under gradual selection. This raises concerns about bacterial communities’ resilience to climate change and the potential cascading effects on biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem stability.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Strains and Microbial Methods Bacillus strains were originally isolated from Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila, México, as described [29]. The strains were collected from sediment in the Churince water system. Three strains grouped with the B. cereus lineage were 99% similar based on sequence variation of the 16S rRNA gene (accession numbers Bc_370a MK850162.1, Bc_102 MK880370, and Bc_111b MK850167.1), as well as four strains from the B. subtilis lineage (accession numbers Bs_21 MK850173.1, Bs_90 MK850153.1, and Bs_427 MK850159.1 and laboratory strain PY79 MK850170.1). Accession numbers for the genomes of the strains are: SAMN09761860: B.subtilis_21_anc_ehb001 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761861: B.subtilis_90_anc_ehb002 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761862: B.subtilis_427_anc_ehb003 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761863: B.subtilis_PY79_anc_ehb004 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761864: B.cereus_370a_anc_ehb005 (TaxID: 1396); SAMN09761865: B.cereus_102_anc_ehb006 (TaxID: 1396); SAMN09761866: B.cereus_111b_anc_ehb007 (TaxID: 1396). Strains were preserved at −70 °C in a marine medium [30] supplemented with 80% glycerol. For experimental use, strains were revived by streaking onto marine medium agar plates (1.6% agar) and incubated overnight at 28 °C. Single colonies were transferred into a liquid marine medium and incubated at 37 °C overnight to establish starting cultures. 2.2. Plate Incubation Experiments Temperature tolerance was assessed by streaking the strains onto marine medium agar plates and incubating them at 37 °C, 44 °C, and 55 °C for 24 h. After the initial incubation, plates were transferred to 28 °C and incubated for an additional 48 h. Photographs were taken at both incubation stages to document growth and colony morphology. 2.3. Experimental Evolution Seven Bacillus strains with previously characterized thermal tolerance [14] were selected, comprising four strains from the B. subtilis lineage (three wild isolates and the lab strain B. subtilis PY79) and three strains from the B. cereus lineage. Ancestral strains were frozen as reference samples. Experimental evolution was conducted in 50 mL Falcon tubes with cultures agitated at 150 rpm. For each strain, three populations evolved at a constant temperature of 37 °C, while another three populations were exposed to an incremental temperature regime starting at 43 °C and increasing to 47 °C over a period of 90 days. Cultures were diluted 100-fold [31] every 12 h by transferring 50 µL of the culture into 5 mL of fresh marine medium, achieving approximately 1000 generations over 105 days. Generation counts were estimated based on viable cell numbers at saturation and calculated division rates. Turbidity measurements were taken every 12 h. In the incremental temperature treatment, the temperature was raised by 0.1 °C per day, contingent on observable growth (turbidity). If growth rates decreased significantly, indicated by low turbidity, temperature increases were paused or reduced, and inoculum volume was adjusted from 50 µL to 100 µL as needed. Temperature adjustments over time were recorded and represented as a parabolic curve (Figure 1A). Weekly samples of each evolving population were stored at −70 °C in 80% glycerol. At the experiment’s conclusion, colonies from each of the 42 evolved populations were isolated, and a representative evolved strain from each population was selected for further analysis. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental setup and lineage descent. (A) Inoculation and transfers were performed every 12 h until reaching approximately 1000 generations (eight generations per transfer). The plot illustrates the measured temperature profiles of the incubator over 1000 generations both for the population evolved under highly critical temperature (HCT) and the constant (lower) temperature treatment (CTT) at 37 °C. The mathematical model for HCT is represented as 4.04 + 0.59(t0.5), with an R2 value of 0.8685. (B) The figure depicts the four parental strains from the B. subtilis lineage (left) and their respective descending lines labeled from A to L (HCT) and a to l (CTT_37 °C). Similarly, three parental strains from the B. cereus lineage (right) are depicted along with their corresponding descending lines named from A to L (HCT) and a to l (CTT_37 °C). 2.4. Norms of Reaction to Temperature Reaction norms for parental and evolved strains were determined using growth kinetics at various temperatures. Doubling times were calculated from the exponential growth phase to plot the growth rate against temperature. Strains were reactivated from −70 °C stocks on marine medium agar and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. A single colony was used to inoculate 5 mL of marine medium broth and incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Cultures were transferred to achieve exponential phase by subculturing 50 µL into fresh broth for 2 h. Growth measurements were performed using a Bioscreen C plate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) with a 420–580 nm filter. Each well of a 200-well microtiter plate was inoculated with 5 µL of culture and 175 µL of fresh marine medium broth, with three technical replicates per condition. Optical density was recorded every 30 min for 20 h. Growth kinetics were assessed at 17 °C, 27 °C, 37 °C, 41 °C, 43 °C, 46 °C, 49 °C, and 55 °C. Doubling times were calculated using exponential growth models. Reaction norms were compared using t-tests and multiple ANOVA tests (significance level 0.05) in Statgraphics 15.2.06 and R version 3.6.2. 2.5. Genome Sequencing and Data Analysis DNA was extracted using the QuickGene DNA tissue kit S (Kurabo Industries LTD., FujiFilm, Osaka, Japan). Sequencing was conducted at Cinvestav-Langebio on an Illumina MiSeq platform at 50× coverage in a paired-end format, with ~180 bp fragment sizes. Paired-end reads were quality-checked using FastQC and trimmed with Trimmomatic. Genome assemblies were generated with SPAdes v3.13.0 and evaluated for quality using N50 and %GC content. Variant calling was performed using GATK Haplotype Caller, and mutations were annotated with Prokka and Patric. Custom scripts were used to integrate Prokka GFF files with VCF data from GATK. Additionally, we employed a “fragmentome” analysis to ensure correct linkage of evolved genomes to their respective parental strains. In this approach, we first generated sets of diagnostic DNA fragments (1000 bp each) from the original ancestral genome sequences. By comparing these fragments against all assembled genomes, we identified those that were uniquely present (i.e., matched only their strain of origin) and thus served as reliable strain-specific genetic markers. Using these diagnostic fragments, we could confidently map evolved reads back to the appropriate parental genome. Unlike standard alignments to a single reference genome, this method provides a lineage-specific signature that helps distinguish closely related ancestral strains and their evolved descendants. This ensures that any potential cross-contamination or mislabeling during experimental evolution or sequencing could be easily detected, as evolved strains must match their diagnostic fragments and not produce hits against other parental genomes. Assembled reference genomes of each representative ancestral strain were obtained, making it possible to generate these strain-specific diagnostic fragments prior to the mapping of evolved sequences. Variants were filtered with a quality threshold of 100, and low-quality mutations (<40) were excluded. Mutation categories included intergenic, genic, indels, and single substitutions. Mutations of interest were validated by Sanger sequencing. Annotated mutations were analyzed using UniProt, GO, and PFAM databases. Gene lists, oligonucleotide sequences, and accession numbers for sequencing data for evolved strains are provided in Supplementary Tables. 2.6. Sporulation Capacity Sporulation was assessed on marine medium plates after seven days at room temperature. Samples were stained with malachite green and examined under a Leica 020-518.500 DM/LS optical microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) to confirm the presence or absence of spores.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Experimental Evolution at Highly Critical Temperatures and Evolutionary Rescue We conducted experimental evolution to test if the thermal tolerance of vegetative Bacillus strains could be enhanced through gradual temperature increases (Figure 1A). Our study included seven strains from two lineages: three Bacillus cereus strains and four Bacillus subtilis strains, both of which are part of strongly supported monophyletic clades within the Bacillaceae family [32,33]. The wild strains were originally isolated from a temperate hydrological system [29,34], and previous research indicated that these strains are mesophilic, with thermal tolerance largely influenced by lineage [14]. We hypothesized that a gradual increase in temperature would serve as a selective force, potentially expanding the thermal tolerance limits of these strains. With genetic variation among the seven strains, we anticipated diverse adaptive evolutionary strategies. The experimental design involved two temperature regimes: one with a constant temperature of 37 °C and another with incremental increases from 43 °C, aiming for approximately 1000 generations (Figure 1B). Growth at 43 °C initially varied significantly among strains. Specifically, B. cereus strains were highly sensitive, unable to sustain growth beyond 48 h at this temperature, while B. subtilis strains exhibited greater resilience. For B. cereus, growth restoration occurred after lowering the temperature to 42 °C, suggesting an evolutionary rescue mechanism. B. subtilis, in contrast, maintained growth more consistently, allowing for temperature increments of 0.1 °C per day. Temperature increments continued until the strains reached a plateau at 45 °C after approximately 300 generations and then slowed down (Figure 1A). The increment frequency decreased further until no additional adaptation was observed over the last 300 generations, indicating a stabilization of phenotypes. B. subtilis lineages showed a greater overall capacity to survive and adapt than B. cereus, consistent with their initial phenotypic plasticity. 3.2. Differences in Plasticity and Critical Temperature Limits To assess changes in thermal tolerance, we compared the reaction norms of evolved and parental strains. Growth kinetics were measured across a temperature range from 17 °C to 55 °C and doubling times were used to construct growth rate curves. 3.2.1. Plasticity and Critical Temperature Limits for Bacillus subtilis Lineages Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate the reaction norms for B. subtilis strains. The Bs_21 and Bs_427 strains demonstrated the most substantial increases in tolerance at higher temperatures. Notably, several Bs_21 lines grew successfully at up to 49 °C, although the results varied among lines (a-b-c-A-C). All Bs_427-evolved lines showed improved growth at 46 °C and 49 °C, regardless of whether they were evolved under constant temperature treatment (CTT) or the high critical temperature (HCT) regime. This suggests that adaptation may be influenced by factors related to the growth medium. A statistically significant reduction in growth was observed for some Bs_427 lines (B and b) at 37 °C. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Norms of reaction Bacillus subtilis parental strains (black) and their respective evolved lines at HCT treatment (red) and CTT treatment (37 °C) (blue). Vertical bars are confidence intervals; qt 95% (ANOVA analysis, p = 0.05). Horizontal lines at the top of each graph represent the temperature niche of the ancestral strains (black) and strains evolved under CTT (blue) or HCT treatments (red).Figure 3.

Vertical bars are confidence intervals; qt 95% (ANOVA analysis, p = 0.05). Horizontal lines at the top of each graph represent the temperature niche of the ancestral strains (black) and strains evolved under CTT (blue) or HCT treatments (red).Bs_90 exhibited limited improvement in thermal tolerance, with only minor increases in growth at 43 °C for the D-E-d-e lines and barely significant growth at 46 °C for the D-E-F lines. The Bs_90 strain was the least capable of growing at 49 °C, though all evolved lines still outperformed the parental strain. A trade-off was evident in Bs_90, with all evolved lines showing reduced growth at lower temperatures (17–37 °C). In contrast, the laboratory strain Bs_PY79 showed consistent growth across temperatures up to 37 °C. While some high-temperature-evolved lines (J-K-L) demonstrated improved tolerance at 49 °C, they experienced a marked reduction in growth at 17 °C and 27 °C. Interestingly, all Bs_PY79 lines performed similarly to the parental strain at 43 °C, without surpassing its tolerance at 46 °C.3.2.2. Plasticity and Critical Temperature Limits for Bacillus cereus Lineages For B. cereus, the reaction norms revealed minimal improvements post-evolution. Strain Bc_370a exhibited poorer growth than the parental strain, particularly for lines evolved under the HCT regime, which showed decreased growth at 27 °C and 37 °C. Bc_102 demonstrated the best improvements in thermal tolerance among HCT-evolved lines, though CTT-evolved lines generally showed reduced growth compared to the parental strain. Bc_111b presented a slight increase in growth at 43–46 °C for line U, indicating potential thermal adaptation. However, the S-T-U lines (HCT-evolved) exhibited a reduction in fitness across a lower temperature range (17–39 °C), suggesting maladaptive consequences of high-temperature evolution. 3.3. Changes in Carrying Capacity (K) and Growth Rate (G) To further understand the adaptive strategies of evolved Bacillus strains, we assessed changes in two critical growth parameters: carrying capacity (K) and specific growth rate (G) at 37 °C and 43 °C. These measurements provided insights into whether the adaptations were multifactorial, impacting not just the growth rate but also the overall population density the cultures could sustain. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of experimental evolution treatments of the traits evaluated for each strain at both 37 °C and 43 °C highlighted the phenotypic responses and adaptations under different temperature regimes (Supplementary Figure S4). 3.3.1. Impact of Temperature on Growth and Carrying Capacity on Bacillus subtilis Lineages Figure 4 shows the normalized results for B. subtilis strains. In Bs_21, significant changes were observed in both K37 and K43, suggesting substantial adaptation, particularly for the D-E-F lines under the high-temperature treatment. Bs_90 displayed pronounced effects in K43, specifically for the D-E-F lines, indicating a temperature-driven adaptation. However, the adaptation appeared limited, as growth improvements did not extend uniformly across all lines. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Growth and carrying capacity in parental and experimentally evolved lines.In Bs_427, we observed increases in both K37 and K43 values compared to the parental strain, reflecting an adaptation that may be driven by the growth medium. The enhanced carrying capacity at 43 °C suggests some degree of temperature adaptation, especially for the D-E-F lines. In Bs_PY79, all evolved lines showed increases in K37 and K43, consistent with medium-driven adaptation rather than temperature-specific changes. Parental strains of Bacillus subtilis are represented by black bars, while their descendant lines under highly critical temperature (HCT) treatment are depicted with red bars and those under constant temperature treatment at 37 °C are shown in blue bars. Each panel comprises charts illustrating the maximum change in growth cultures of lines evolved at a constant low temperature (37 °C) and at a highly critical temperature (43 °C) on the left and carrying capacity (K) at 37 °C and 43 °C on the right.3.3.2. Impact of Temperature on Growth and Carrying Capacity on Bacillus cereus Lineages Figure 5 illustrates the phenotypic changes in B. cereus strains. Bc_370a showed a strong effect on all lines for the parameter G37, implying adaptation to the growth medium rather than temperature. However, a significant impact on K43 was observed only in the M-N-O lines, which underwent high-temperature evolution, indicating some level of thermal adaptation. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Growth and carrying capacity in parental and experimentally evolved lines.In Bc_102, the analysis of K43 revealed stronger adaptation to high temperature in the P-Q-R lines compared to p-q-r. This suggests that thermal adaptation occurred despite the reaction norms not clearly indicating such changes. Specific growth rates (G37) also demonstrated some improvements, although these were less pronounced. For Bc_111b, G43 showed a marked increase across all evolved lines, indicating medium adaptation. However, K43 was significantly higher in the S-T-U lines compared to s-t-u and the parental strain, pointing to an evident effect of temperature adaptation. Parental strains of Bacillus subtilis are represented by black bars, while their descendant lines under highly critical temperature (HCT) treatment are depicted with red bars, and those under constant temperature treatment at 37 °C are shown in blue bars. Each panel comprises charts illustrating the maximum change in growth cultures of lines evolved at a constant low temperature (37 °C) and at a highly critical temperature (43 °C) to the left and the carrying capacity (K) at 37 °C and 43 °C to the right. Table 1 is a summary of the overall impact that evolution at either CTT or HCT had on the B. cereus and B. subtilis lineages. It is evident that a single line, Bs _427, was able to extend its thermal tolerance. None of the lines from the laboratory strain PY79 exhibited changes at any of the temperatures evaluated. All the evolved B. cereus lines reduced their growth capacity compared to the ancestral line. Table 1. Summary of temperature plasticity gained on growth and carrying capacity by the evolved lines.

Changes in Colony Growth, Pigmentation, and Loss of Sporulation in Evolved Lines We evaluated changes in colonial phenotypes by growing parental and evolved Bacillus strains on marine medium agar plates (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). The top rows in the figures show the parental strains, while the lower rows display the six evolved strains (three evolved under the low-temperature treatment, LTT, and three under the highly critical temperature, HCT). Our semi-quantitative assessments revealed significant changes in colony growth among evolved strains. Notably, the B. cereus-evolved lines exhibited a substantial reduction in growth compared to their parental strains, a finding consistent with the reaction norm data. This reduction was particularly evident in lines M, N, Q, S, and T, which underwent HCT treatment. In contrast, the B. subtilis-evolved strains demonstrated more resilience, retaining a higher growth capacity. The observed differences suggest a trade-off in B. cereus, where the selective pressure to endure high temperatures may have compromised their ability to grow rapidly. This trade-off likely represents an adaptive strategy prioritizing survival over growth efficiency. Specifically, the B. cereus strains appear to have evolved a mechanism to endure heat stress by reducing metabolic demands, which could explain their diminished growth rates. Additionally, phenotypic changes were evident in colony pigmentation, especially among the B. subtilis-evolved lines. We observed distinct pigmentation changes in lines A, B, G, and I, indicative of altered metabolic or regulatory pathways as a response to prolonged heat exposure (Supplementary Figure S2). We also noted a loss of sporulation ability in several evolved strains. This was particularly pronounced in the B. cereus HCT-evolved lines, suggesting that the evolutionary pressure to maintain vegetative cell function at high temperatures led to a trade-off, where sporulation capacity was compromised. This finding aligns with the hypothesis that Bacillus strains may sacrifice their ability to form heat-resistant spores to maintain active metabolic processes, which may be crucial for survival in fluctuating but non-lethal high temperatures. 3.5. Convergence in Mutations of Strains Evolved at Highly Critical Temperature Reveals the Role of di-C-AMP and Osmolytes in Temperature Tolerance We sequenced the genomes of a representative clone from both the parental and evolved lines (seven parental genomes, 21 evolved genomes at CTT, and 21 evolved genomes at HCT). The genomes were assembled and annotated, and mutations were identified by comparing each evolved genome to its respective parental genome using GATK tools (see Materials and Methods). A workflow of Bioinformatic Analysis of Evolved Genomes and Mutations is shown in Supplementary Figure S3. 3.5.1. Identification and Exclusion of Hypermutator Lines Seven lines exhibited hypermutator phenotypes, characterized by the accumulation of 39 to 219 mutations. These hypermutator lines were excluded from further analysis to avoid skewed results. The hypermutant criterion was established based on a significant deviation from the expected linear distribution of mutation accumulation (Supplementary Figure S5). Hypermutators were identified in both B. subtilis (lines A and G) and B. cereus (lines N, m, q, r, and S), with no apparent correlation to temperature treatment or bacterial lineage, suggesting that the hypermutant phenotype was independent of these factors. These hypermutant lines are depicted as gray labels in Figure 6. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Mutation analysis of strains evolved from the Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus lineages. Each lineage underwent highly critical temperature (HCT, red) treatment and constant temperature treatment (CTT, blue) with three replicates. The diagram illustrates the treatment conditions for each lineage and the total number of mutations observed after the genome sequencing of a colony from the final evolution transfer. Loss of sporulation in evolved lines occurred in strains marked with red or blue triangles. Lines in gray represent hypermutant phenotypes, which were excluded from our analyses to reduce noise in data correlation. Orange asterisks denote convergent mutations at the gene level in the cyclic d-AMP synthase gene (cdaR in B. subtilis or disA in B. cereus), found in independent evolving lines under highly critical temperatures, supporting evidence of positive selection (statistical analysis in the results section).3.5.2. Classification of Mutations in Lines Evolved at 37 °C (CTT) and Above the HCT After excluding hypermutators, mutations were categorized into single-nucleotide substitutions, one to three base indels, and large genomic rearrangements, further classified as intergenic or intragenic. Most of the identified mutations were single-base indels, predominantly affecting open reading frames (ORFs). Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the specific intragenic mutations. Supplementary Table S1 shows a list of all types of mutations in each evolved line. Sporulation loss and the quantification for each mutation type are shown in Supplementary Figure S6. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Distribution of mutations in lines evolved at constant low temperature (37 °C) across gene functional categories. The figure displays the distribution of mutations observed in lines evolved at a constant low temperature (37 °C), categorized by gene functional categories. Black squares indicate genes with at least one mutation in the depicted category, with the number within the black squares representing the number of mutated genes within that category. White squares denote the absence of mutations in the respective gene functional categories. Gray squares are used for all hypermutant strains that were not analyzed. Additionally, red squares highlight genes that have been described as being associated with the observed phenotype.Figure 8.

The figure illustrates the distribution of mutations observed in lines evolved under highly critical temperature treatment (HCT), categorized by gene functional categories. Black squares represent genes with at least one mutation in the depicted category, with the number within the black squares indicating the number of mutated genes within that category. White squares indicate the absence of mutations in the respective gene functional categories. Gray squares denote hypermutant strains that were not analyzed. Additionally, red squares highlight genes associated with the observed phenotype. An orange square specifically highlights di-adenylate synthase-encoding genes.3.5.3. Mutational Analysis in CTT-Evolved Lines In CTT-evolved lines, we identified eight mutations in genes associated with transcription regulation (a-o-p-u lines), six mutations in transport-related genes (a-c-j-p lines), and six in sporulation-related genes (a-d-j-p lines). A significant mutation was detected in strain Bs_a within the SigB regulon, known for its role in thermal stress response [35]. Additional mutations were found in genes involved in DNA replication, methylation, flagellum assembly, metabolite biosynthesis, and cell wall structure (Figure 8).3.5.4. Mutational Analysis in HCT-Evolved Lines In HCT-evolved lines, we found six mutations in transcription-regulation genes (B-F-M-O-Q-T lines) and six in transport genes (B-D-L-M-P-U lines), reflecting the impact on general metabolic processes. Only one mutation affected a sporulation-related gene, lipC, in line B of the Bs_21 strain without causing sporulation defects. Mutations of particular interest included those in glycine–betaine transport genes, crucial for both osmotic and thermal stress resistance [36]. Mutations interrupting the DnaD and RNase H encoding genes were found in line B of the Bs_21 strain. DnaD has been reported to be part of the replisome Turner 2004 and for replication fork progression under replication stress [37]. B. subtilis has two RNase H genes [38]. In bacteria, RNAse H is involved in the removal of RNA in RNA:DNA hybrids, and, in B. subtilis, the absence of one of the RNase H genes results in an accumulation of hybrids upstream of active coding genes with an impact in transcription and increased mutations [39]. Interestingly, strain Bs_B has 37 mutations, one of the most numerous in evolved lines (Supplementary Table S1). We also identified mutations in arginine metabolism genes linked to thermal stress in B. subtilis [35] and inositol metabolism genes known for their thermoprotective properties [40]. A chi-squared test comparing five thermal stress-associated mutations in HCT-treated lines to one in CTT-treated lines suggested a significant temperature-dependent effect.3.5.5. Uncovering of di-Adenylate Cyclases (DACs) in Temperature Adaptation A noteworthy finding was the emergence of mutations in genes encoding di-adenylate cyclases (DACs), observed exclusively in HCT-evolved lines (Figure 9). DACs synthesize c-di-AMP from ATP, a secondary metabolite involved in growth regulation, membrane stability, glycine-betaine transport, and potassium uptake. We identified three loss-of-function mutations in the disA gene of B. cereus (lines O-P-T) and two in the cdaR gene of B. subtilis (lines D and F), with frameshifts occurring in the first half of the ORFs (Supplementary Figure S7). Binomial tests indicated a statistically significant occurrence of these mutations: a probability of 1.68 × 10−4 for B. cereus and 1.37 × 10−3 for B. subtilis. Given the total number of genes (5200 in B. cereus and 4100 in B. subtilis), these findings suggest a selective advantage for DAC-related mutations under high-temperature conditions. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Convergent evolution in lines evolved at highly critical temperatures revealed cyclic di-AMP as a key player. The figure illustrates convergent evolution observed in lines evolved at highly critical temperature (HCT), highlighting cyclic di-AMP as a significant factor. A red X denotes the proteins predicted to be absent due to gene mutation. Both Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus possess three cyclic di-AMP synthase genes, with two expressed during the vegetative phase and the third restricted to sporulation. In B. subtilis, the mutated gene was cdaR, a regulator of the synthetase gene, while in B. cereus, mutations impacted the disA gene, the synthetase itself. Cyclic di-AMP plays a crucial role in regulating K+ uptake, a critical factor in maintaining osmotic balance, suggesting its role in adapting to heat stress.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion Our study highlights lineage-specific strategies by using experimental evolution with gradual temperature increases. It reveals significant differences in how Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus lineages evolved thermal tolerance when subjected to gradual temperature increases beyond their thermal niche. B. subtilis strains displayed minimal changes in reaction norms, reflecting their greater inherent phenotypic plasticity, while B. cereus strains showed clear trade-offs, such as reduced growth rates at lower and even higher temperatures, indicating that high-temperature selection imposed a substantial evolutionary cost. These results suggest that larger initial plasticity might buffer against rapid adaptation under short-term experimental conditions. In our study, the B. cereus strains initially struggled under high-temperature stress but managed to stabilize and recover growth within weeks, although, several times, we had to stop the regime of increasing temperature until the final 300 generations of constant high-temperature selection. These strains accumulated more mutations than those of the B. subtilis lineage. This is similar to what Mongold et al. [28] observed for E. coli growth at the limit of their niche temperature and suggests that evolutionary rescue mechanisms were at play, allowing the strains to persist despite the harsh conditions. The concept of evolutionary rescue is particularly relevant to our observations. Evolutionary rescue occurs when adaptive genetic changes enable populations to recover from near extinction under severe environmental stress [41,42]. While B. subtilis benefited from its broad thermal tolerance, B. cereus needed substantial genetic adjustments to cope with high temperatures. This observation raises critical questions about the role of plasticity in evolutionary dynamics. Does higher plasticity hinder adaptation by reducing selective pressure, or does it enable immediate survival, allowing for gradual genetic changes? Our data support the notion that short-term evolution favors species with inherent plasticity, while long-term selection can drive adaptive genetic changes in species with less initial plasticity. B. subtilis can be considered to possess more thermal plasticity compared to B. cereus. This conclusion aligns with previous findings by Hurtado et al. [14], which highlighted differences between the B. cereus and B. subtilis lineages in their upper tolerance limits, comparing strains from a thermal spring to those from a temperate lagoon. In this study, only B. subtilis-evolved lines exhibited better growth than the parental strain at the HCT. At the same time, three of four B. subtilis lineages surpassed their ancestral strain’s tolerance limit even at 49 °C. However, it is essential to note that the B. subtilis lines evolved at 37 °C were also able to increase their thermal limit. The pressure of maintaining continuous growth in this particular medium impacted the metabolism that favored thermal tolerance. This is concordant with the change in carrying capacity that resulted from the experimental evolution, particularly for the B. subtilis lines, for which higher carrying capacity changes occur in all lines, whether evolved at 37 °C or at high temperature. This contrasts with B. cereus lines, for which only the lines evolved at higher temperatures exhibit increased carrying capacity under heat stress. These results suggest a shift in metabolism. Accordingly, the expression of proteins that provide stress tolerance or the capacity to adapt to new environmental conditions rapidly is expected to be at the expense of growth-related proteins, reducing the instantaneous growth rate [43]. Finally, adaptation at high temperatures came with trade-offs, as evidenced by poorer growth at lower temperatures. This was observed for B. cereus lines but not for B. subtilis. Our results showed decreased fitness of some of the evolved B. cereus lines (Bc111 and Bc370) at what was the ancestral strain’s optimal growth temperature, as a trade-off for adapting to high temperatures. This supports evolutionary theory, which suggests pleiotropic effects, where genes affecting multiple traits may constrain adaptation and result in maladaptation [44]. Genetic analysis revealed that mutations in genes involved in osmolyte metabolism and heat-shock responses played critical roles in thermal tolerance. For instance, arginine and trehalose metabolism mutations were associated with improved thermal resilience. Arginine biosynthesis is known to be induced under heat stress [35], and trehalose has been suggested to act as a thermoprotectant, stabilizing proteins and membranes [45]. These mutations differ from those described in Ref. [46] from an experimental evolution experiment with B. subtilis, with a temperature regime of 50 °C. Sequencing revealed mutations in genes encoding proteins associated with pathways known to be involved in heat stress response (hrcA, ftsH) and other stress proteins (relA and sigW). We do not expect to find mutations in genes involved in the thermal response, such as those described by Hecker et al. (1996) [36] and Helmann et al. (2001) [35], which, if mutated, would be expected to reduce tolerance to temperature. A novel and significant finding of our study was the convergence of mutations in DAC genes in several strains in both lineages. DAC genes are involved in the synthesis of c-di-AMP. Both B. cereus and B. subtilis possess three genes for the synthesis of c-di-AMP, DisA, and CdaA function in the vegetative phase, while CdaS is sporulation-specific [47]. Most studies have been carried out in B. subtilis, and it is known that the activity of CdaA is modulated by CdaR. c-di-AMP is essential for the growth of B. subtilis and DisA and CdaA contribute to modulating different DNA damage responses during exponential growth [48]. The parallel occurrence of mutations in DAC genes (cdaR in B. subtilis and disA in B. cereus, Figure 9) is intriguing. Several lines of evidence suggest that the di-adenylate cyclase CdaA is part of the conserved essential cda-glm module involved in cell wall metabolism. Notably, this molecule regulates potassium transport and osmotic balance [49]; when bacteria are challenged with high osmolarity, they acquire increased resistance to high temperature and oxidative stresses. The high-osmolarity-dependent increase in thermotolerance has two manifestations: the elevation of the upper limit of the growth temperature and enhanced survival at otherwise lethal high temperatures [50]. Although c-di-AMP is involved in many essential pathways, to participate in virulence and osmotic stress, it has not been implicated in thermal stress. The parallel occurrence of mutations in DAC genes (cdaR in B. subtilis and disA in B. cereus, Figure 9) strongly suggests its role in heat stress tolerance. Our results suggest a lineage-specific evolution in the modulation of the c-di-AMP regulation. In either case, potassium uptake is likely involved in mitigating membrane destabilization caused by high temperatures. In B. subtilis and many other bacteria, a sudden increase in the intracellular potassium concentration is the first response to osmotic stress [51]. Thus, the control of potassium homeostasis by c-di-AMP might also be part of a larger picture of the regulation of osmoadaptation. It has been shown that a variety of compatible solutes (i.e., glycine–betaine, proline) serve as heat protectants for B. subtilis. B subtilis has several redundant transporters, such that a mutation is one of the transporters that has no impact on heat stress [52] on molecular adaptation regardless of whether it restores physiological and molecular processes from a stressed state back toward the unstressed, wild-type state, or whether it instead tends to drive the evolution of novelty [53]. Previous studies have suggested the former because studies have shown that E. coli adapts to high-temperature stress (42.2 °C) by restoring both gene expression [54,55] and phenotypic characteristics [27] toward that of the unstressed ancestor. We think that expanding the thermal niche requires both adapting gene expression to a new threshold, as the previous level is inadequate for the permanent extra-limit temperature stress and the novelty to withstand permanent stress. In this sense, we suggest that cells regulate the levels of c-di-AMP to fit the novel stressful conditions. These findings open up new avenues for understanding the role of c-di-AMP in bacterial heat stress response. Our experimental design, starting with two species and multiple strains, allowed us to explore the potential for parallel evolution [56] and identify multiple pathways leading to thermal tolerance. Parallel evolution, defined as the independent evolution of the same phenotype or genotype in response to identical selection pressures, provides insights into the predictability and diversity of evolutionary outcomes. In this study, we observed that while mutations affecting c-di-AMP synthesis emerged in all three B. cereus lineages, only one B. subtilis lineage (Bs_90) evolved a similar mutation. This finding suggests that while the modulation of c-di-AMP synthesis is a common and potentially “go-to” solution for thermal tolerance, it is not the only pathway. The presence of c-di-AMP mutations in multiple lineages across species highlights its broad utility, yet the absence of these mutations in some evolved lines underscores the diversity of evolutionary strategies. This observation supports the notion that standing genetic variation provides multiple routes to equivalent phenotypes, with natural selection shaping the most accessible solutions within specific genetic and physiological contexts. Multiple pathways can lead to thermal tolerance, even under identical selective pressures, emphasizing the power of parallel evolution to reveal evolutionary constraints and opportunities. These findings align with the idea that evolution often proceeds along a single pathway within a given lineage but that alternative routes remain viable under different genetic or environmental conditions. By leveraging two species and multiple strains, our study underscores the importance of comparative approaches in experimental evolution for uncovering shared and lineage-specific adaptation mechanisms. Our findings suggest that while different genetic pathways can lead to thermal tolerance, these pathways may converge on similar metabolic routes, such as osmotic protection. Mutations in genes regulating c-di-AMP synthesis highlight one such path, given its role in potassium transport and osmotic balance under stress. However, it is important to acknowledge a significant caveat in our analysis: genome sequencing identifies intragenic mutations that could be associated with the phenotype but cannot infer the impact of mutations in intergenic regions. Additionally, when multiple mutations occur within a genome, it is challenging to discern which specific mutations are responsible for the observed phenotypes. When working with wild strains, it is more challenging to reintroduce single mutations to validate the phenotype. Transcriptomic analyses would be necessary to uncover the overarching metabolic strategies and determine how these mutations integrate into the broader cellular response to thermal stress. Such analyses could reveal differential gene expression patterns and regulatory networks contributing to adaptation, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the metabolic adjustments underlying thermal tolerance. The limited thermal tolerance observed in our study, even after experimental evolution, raises concerns about the capacity of microbial communities to adapt to climate change. Given the vital roles of Bacillus species in biogeochemical cycles, constraints on their thermal adaptability could have cascading effects on ecosystem functions, nutrient cycling, and soil health. Our findings suggest that while some bacterial populations may experience evolutionary rescue, the associated trade-offs could limit their ecological success and impact global processes. It is notable that the three strains within each Bacillus lineage (B. subtilis and B. cereus) exhibited consistent, lineage-specific outcomes. Furthermore, the three independently evolved lines for each strain displayed similar trends in temperature tolerance, despite differences in the underlying mutations driving their responses. This result suggests a strong influence of both genetic background and lineage-specific traits in shaping the adaptive responses to temperature stress in Bacillus species. The consistency in outcomes within each lineage (B. subtilis and B. cereus) highlights that certain inherent genetic or physiological characteristics predispose these lineages to follow specific evolutionary trajectories. Our observations indicate that B. cereus lineages tended to accumulate more mutations yet did not achieve markedly better fitness at higher temperatures, whereas B. subtilis lineages adapted to elevated temperatures with comparatively fewer mutations, suggesting greater inherent thermal plasticity or more efficient physiological and regulatory mechanisms for coping with thermal stress. Several factors may underlie these differences. First, B. subtilis may possess a more robust stress response system, including efficient chaperones, heat-shock proteins, and membrane adaptations that minimize the need for extensive genetic change. Second, differences in metabolic versatility and regulatory network flexibility may enable B. subtilis to rapidly optimize gene expression and protein function at higher temperatures, while B. cereus may rely more on genetic alterations that do not directly translate into fitness gains. Additionally, species-specific genomic architecture and mutation biases could shape distinct evolutionary trajectories, with B. cereus potentially having less efficient DNA repair or a mutational spectrum that fails to confer adaptive benefits under thermal stress. Furthermore, the evolutionary histories and ecological niches of these species influence their baseline adaptability; for instance, the laboratory-adapted B. subtilis strain-like PY79 may have evolved pre-adaptations suited to fluctuating conditions, whereas B. cereus, adapted to more stable environments, struggles to exploit novel thermal niches despite generating substantial genetic variation. For example, such lineage-specific adaptations have been documented by Guinebretière et al. (2008) [57], who showed that different taxonomic groups of B. cereus display lineage-associated thermal profiles ranging from 7 to 50 °C, explaining why B. cereus populations in warm parts of a dairy process differ from those in colder parts [58]. The observed lineage-specific outcomes and convergence within strains underscore the critical role of genetic background in shaping adaptive responses. However, the diversity of underlying mutations leading to similar phenotypic outcomes highlights the unpredictability of evolutionary pathways. This variability suggests that microbial responses to environmental stressors, such as climate change, may be highly context-dependent and difficult to generalize. Each genetic background provides a distinct set of constraints and opportunities, leading to diverse adaptive trajectories even under similar selective pressures. Consequently, this result makes it more challenging to predict how microbial communities, composed of diverse genetic lineages, will respond to global warming. While some lineages may adapt via predictable mechanisms, others may follow entirely different and unforeseen evolutionary paths. This underscores the need for further studies that explore the interplay between genetic background, evolutionary dynamics, and environmental change to better understand and anticipate microbial responses at both the species and community levels. In addition to well-characterized experimental evolution studies in E. coli (e.g., Tenaillon et al. [24]), recent research has increasingly explored evolutionary dynamics in Bacillus and other wild bacterial lineages under various selective pressures. For instance, B. subtilis has served as a model in experimental evolution to investigate adaptation in plant-associated environments and in the presence of competing species. Pomerleau et al. [59] demonstrated that B. subtilis rapidly evolved enhanced root colonization capacity under biotic stress imposed by Pseudomonas species, pinpointing mutations in regulators linked to biofilm development. Likewise, Blake et al. [60] showed that B. subtilis populations adapted to the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana diversified into distinct lineages, with some evolved strains improving their host-specific colonization abilities. These findings highlight how environmental context shapes adaptive trajectories and can promote genetic diversification. Other studies emphasize the role of genetic mechanisms, such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), in shaping adaptation. Slomka et al. [61] found that B. subtilis populations evolving under high-salt conditions acquired extensive foreign DNA, improving salt tolerance via bursts of HGT. Although our study focused on thermal adaptation rather than osmotic stress, these results underscore the importance of both point mutations and gene acquisition in driving evolutionary responses and raise the question of whether thermal adaptation might also draw on similar genetic sources if available. Environmental fluctuations and life-history traits can further influence evolutionary outcomes. Shoemaker et al. [62] reported that the capacity for dormancy (“seed banking”) in B. subtilis alters the trajectory of molecular evolution over extended timescales, increasing genetic diversity and affecting the direction of selection on certain genes. Although our experimental design did not directly examine dormancy states, such findings suggest that the intrinsic traits of species, including the ability to form spores, may shape the pace and path of thermal adaptation. Finally, recent molecular and genomic studies highlight the complexity of responses at the RNA and gene-regulatory levels. For example, Jolley et al. [63] demonstrated that B. subtilis dynamically adjusts its RNA structure in response to temperature changes, potentially providing an additional layer of rapid, non-mutational adaptation. Similarly, Hawkins et al. [64] and Shi et al. [65] explored how essential genes and sporulation-related loci evolve over time, offering insights into how baseline genomic architecture and gene regulatory networks can influence adaptive potential. Taken together, these studies show that Bacillus lineages can evolve through multiple genetic routes—ranging from single-nucleotide changes and HGT events to alterations in regulatory networks—to cope with diverse selective pressures, including thermal stress. They also reveal common themes, such as the role of regulatory mutations and pre-existing physiological traits, which can set certain lineages on more efficient adaptive trajectories. Integrating this broader perspective into our findings suggests that while the mutation rate and the spectrum of mutations we observed may not necessarily correlate with thermal niche expansion, they reflect a complex interplay of genetic background, regulatory flexibility, ecological context, and evolutionary history. By situating our results alongside these other Bacillus and bacterial evolution studies, we gain a more nuanced understanding of how constraints and contingencies influence the adaptive landscape of bacterial populations facing environmental challenges. The experimental constraints of this study, which included the passes for only 1000 generations and laboratory-based conditions, may not fully reflect the complexities of long-term evolutionary dynamics or the ecological interactions that occur in natural settings. Additionally, while we identified several mutations, especially those related to di-adenylate cyclase (DAC) genes, more studies would be necessary to understand their roles. This could involve transcriptomic analysis to better understand gene expression patterns in response to thermal stress. Furthermore, exploring the broader ecological context of these findings, such as how they translate to natural microbial populations and how bacteria respond to other environmental stressors like desiccation or nutrient scarcity, will be essential to evaluate bacterial adaptability and resilience comprehensively.",

Copyright notice ID: 11673879 PMID: 39765755 Simple Summary As global temperatures rise due to climate change, understanding how bacteria respond to heat is essential. Bacteria are critical to ecosystems, helping recycle nutrients, break down organic matter, and support plant growth. If they struggle to adapt to warmer conditions, the effects could ripple through ecosystems. Our study tested whether Bacillus bacteria, common in soil and water, could adapt to gradual temperature increases. We exposed seven strains from two groups to experimental evolution under increasing warming conditions, expecting them to evolve heat tolerance. Although some bacteria showed small improvements in heat tolerance, neither group could evolve to grow well at temperatures just three degrees Celsius above their natural range. This is concerning, as climate change could raise global temperatures by 2–4 °C, which could push these bacteria beyond their limits. We also found that c-di-AMP, a molecule that helps regulate potassium levels in cells, was involved in temperature tolerance. These findings highlight the vulnerability of essential bacteria to climate change and underscore the need for further research to predict and mitigate its impacts on ecosystems. Keywords: experimental evolution, critical high temperature, phenotypic plasticity, norms of reaction to temperature, convergent evolution, c-di-AMP, upper thermal limit, evolutionary rescue, thermal plasticity, thermal nicheAbstract The ongoing rise in global temperatures poses significant challenges to ecosystems, particularly impacting bacterial communities that are central to biogeochemical cycles. The resilience of wild mesophilic bacteria to temperature increases of 2–4 °C remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted experimental evolution on six wild Bacillus strains from two lineages (Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis) to examine their thermal adaptation strategies. We exposed the bacteria to gradually increasing temperatures to assess their thermal plasticity, focusing on the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation. While B. subtilis lineages improved growth at highly critical temperatures, only one increased its thermal niche to 4 °C above their natural range. This finding is concerning given climate change projections. B. cereus strains exhibited higher mutation rates but were not able to grow at increasing temperatures, while B. subtilis required fewer genetic changes to increase heat tolerance, indicating distinct adaptive strategies. We observed convergent evolution in five evolved lines, with mutations in genes involved in c-di-AMP synthesis, which is crucial for potassium transport, implicating this chemical messenger for the first time in heat tolerance. These insights highlight the vulnerability of bacteria to climate change and underscore the importance of genetic background in shaping thermal adaptation.1. Introduction Bacteria are often regarded as highly adaptable to extreme environmental changes, including rising temperatures driven by global warming. However, this perception oversimplifies the complexity of bacterial adaptation and does not account for the millions of years it has taken for the diversity of bacteria to adapt to particular niches. This highlights that their adaptive capacity is deeply rooted in long evolutionary processes. Understanding bacterial responses to heat stress is critical, given their central role in nutrient cycling and ecosystem stability, especially as global temperatures are projected to increase by 2 to 4 °C [1,2]. The impact of rising temperatures extends beyond bacterial physiology, with significant consequences for ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles; for example, elevated ocean temperatures alter nitrogen-fixing microbial populations, threatening the nitrogen cycle in coral reefs [3]. Similarly, warming freshwater ecosystems decreases bacterial diversity, disrupting ecological balance [2]. Rising temperatures are also linked to the spread of antibiotic resistance [4,5] and increased abundance of pathogens like Vibrio cholerae in coastal waters [6]. These examples underscore the urgency of understanding bacterial thermal adaptation in the context of global climate change. Phenotypic plasticity—the ability of organisms to adjust their traits in response to changing environmental conditions [7,8]—allows species to buffer against environmental fluctuations. This adaptability can extend an organism’s ecological range, potentially leading to genetic assimilation, where initially flexible traits become genetically stabilized [9]. Nevertheless, plasticity has inherent limitations and costs, especially under sustained stress [10]. Reaction norms, which describe how a genotype’s phenotype changes across environmental gradients, are valuable tools for assessing thermal limits and understanding adaptive strategies. We can learn about a given organism’s thermal niche through reaction norms (Wolterek, 1909 [11], cited by Stearns [12]). Mesophilic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli [13] and some Bacillus species [14], typically thrive between 27 °C and 40 °C. When exposed to higher temperatures, mesophilic bacteria activate a heat-shock response (HSR), which involves the rapid production of heat-shock proteins that stabilize cellular components and temporarily protect against heat stress [15,16]. However, these adaptations are generally short-lived and insufficient for prolonged survival under extreme temperatures. Escherichia coli, as a well-established model organism, has been extensively studied for its physiological responses to thermal stress. Unlike thermal tolerance, which temporarily protects cells from heat damage by activating heat-shock proteins [17], thermal adaptation requires genetic changes that can withstand and sustain growth at higher temperatures beyond the initial threshold [18]. Experimental evolution is a powerful tool for gaining insights into the capacity of bacteria to adapt to specific biotic and abiotic challenges and understanding the types of mutations that shape or enable such adaptations to changing environments [18,19]. It allows researchers to address a key question in evolutionary biology: whether bacteria can evolve similar phenotypic outcomes through the same or different genetic mechanisms—a phenomenon known as convergent evolution [20,21]. Convergent evolution can manifest in multiple ways, including traits that arise via a conserved genetic mechanism within a clade or through distinct mechanistic bases even among closely related species. Previous experiments have documented a rapid adaptive response of E. coli to high temperatures [22], with evidence that the genetic response can be diverse [23]. Similarly, Tenaillon et al. [24] took a whole-genome approach to estimate the extent of evolutionary convergence that occurs during adaptation in 115 populations of E. coli at a high temperature of 42.2 °C, analyzing the overall genetic basis of adaptation. Their findings highlighted convergence among genes, with the most mutated gene being rpoB, along with proteins that regulate the rpoS stress response (RSS). Although numerous studies have explored the ability of E. coli to evolve at different temperatures [25], few studies have aimed to evolve bacteria to expand their thermal niche. In this context, Murata et al. [26] subjected an E. coli strain to 43 °C and identified 51 genes crucial for thermotolerance, highlighting the diverse genetic pathways involved in developing heat tolerance. Murata introduced the term “critically high temperatures” (CHT) to describe temperatures beyond the thermal limit. Bennett and Lenski [13] sought to isolate evolved lines capable of surpassing the upper thermal limit and found that this limit did not significantly increase in any of the derived lines, even those that evolved at 41–42 °C. Exposure to 44 °C proved lethal, except for one thermotolerant mutant, which managed to grow at 44 °C [27]. Mongold et al. [28] further investigated evolutionary adaptation to what they termed a “lethal thermal environment” by directly shifting evolution to 44 °C. Their findings revealed that three thermotolerant mutants were derived from two progenitor lines that had previously adapted to 41–42 °C, suggesting that these lines extended their upper thermal limit in a stepwise manner relative to their progenitors. Additionally, they noted that not all evolved lines exhibited trade-offs, such as a loss of fitness at lower temperatures. Bacillus strains are particularly important to study in the context of prolonged survival at temperatures exceeding their niche range because they are ubiquitous and ecologically significant, playing key roles in decomposing organic matter and nutrient cycling. Although Bacillus can form heat-tolerant spores that remain dormant for decades, their heterotrophic functions occur only in a vegetative state. Therefore, understanding whether Bacillus can evolve more heat-tolerant vegetative cells is crucial for predicting how these bacteria will respond to global warming. Recent research has shown that wild Bacillus strains exhibit considerable variation in thermal tolerance, influenced by genetic background [14], emphasizing that temperature is a critical factor affecting bacterial growth and survival. Despite extensive research on acute bacterial responses, the long-term evolution of bacterial thermotolerance and the upper thermal limits they can achieve remain poorly understood and research has not been conducted on Bacillus lineages. This study addresses this knowledge gap by investigating whether wild Bacillus strains from two distinct lineages can evolve heat tolerance in their vegetative cells through experimental evolution. We aim to determine whether gradual temperature increases enable these bacteria to develop the plasticity needed to survive projected global temperature rises of 2 to 4 °C and to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying their adaptations. By focusing on different lineages and genetic backgrounds, our research explores the constraints and potential pathways for bacterial adaptation to extreme heat, providing insights into their evolutionary resilience and broader ecosystem impacts. The main conclusions of this work are as follows: 1. The observed lineage-specific outcomes and convergence within strains underscore the critical role of genetic background in shaping adaptive responses. B. cereus and B. subtilis have different plasticity and B. cereus lineages, contrary to those of B. subtilis, and were not able to increase thermal tolerance relative to ancestral lines. Only one evolved B. subtilis line successfully extended its thermal niche. 2. Tolerance to higher temperatures was observed in B. subtilis lines that evolved constantly at 37 °C, indicating a metabolic adjustment driven by continuous growth conditions and the growth medium rather than selective pressure from increased temperatures. 3. Convergent mutations in genes regulating c-di-AMP synthesis uncover, for the first time, its critical role in thermal tolerance. This discovery links molecular mechanisms to thermal adaptation across lineages. 4. Finally, our findings warn about bacteria’s inability to evolve significant thermal tolerance, even under gradual selection. This raises concerns about bacterial communities’ resilience to climate change and the potential cascading effects on biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem stability.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Strains and Microbial Methods Bacillus strains were originally isolated from Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila, México, as described [29]. The strains were collected from sediment in the Churince water system. Three strains grouped with the B. cereus lineage were 99% similar based on sequence variation of the 16S rRNA gene (accession numbers Bc_370a MK850162.1, Bc_102 MK880370, and Bc_111b MK850167.1), as well as four strains from the B. subtilis lineage (accession numbers Bs_21 MK850173.1, Bs_90 MK850153.1, and Bs_427 MK850159.1 and laboratory strain PY79 MK850170.1). Accession numbers for the genomes of the strains are: SAMN09761860: B.subtilis_21_anc_ehb001 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761861: B.subtilis_90_anc_ehb002 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761862: B.subtilis_427_anc_ehb003 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761863: B.subtilis_PY79_anc_ehb004 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761864: B.cereus_370a_anc_ehb005 (TaxID: 1396); SAMN09761865: B.cereus_102_anc_ehb006 (TaxID: 1396); SAMN09761866: B.cereus_111b_anc_ehb007 (TaxID: 1396). Strains were preserved at −70 °C in a marine medium [30] supplemented with 80% glycerol. For experimental use, strains were revived by streaking onto marine medium agar plates (1.6% agar) and incubated overnight at 28 °C. Single colonies were transferred into a liquid marine medium and incubated at 37 °C overnight to establish starting cultures.2.2. Plate Incubation Experiments Temperature tolerance was assessed by streaking the strains onto marine medium agar plates and incubating them at 37 °C, 44 °C, and 55 °C for 24 h. After the initial incubation, plates were transferred to 28 °C and incubated for an additional 48 h. Photographs were taken at both incubation stages to document growth and colony morphology.2.3. Experimental Evolution Seven Bacillus strains with previously characterized thermal tolerance [14] were selected, comprising four strains from the B. subtilis lineage (three wild isolates and the lab strain B. subtilis PY79) and three strains from the B. cereus lineage. Ancestral strains were frozen as reference samples. Experimental evolution was conducted in 50 mL Falcon tubes with cultures agitated at 150 rpm. For each strain, three populations evolved at a constant temperature of 37 °C, while another three populations were exposed to an incremental temperature regime starting at 43 °C and increasing to 47 °C over a period of 90 days. Cultures were diluted 100-fold [31] every 12 h by transferring 50 µL of the culture into 5 mL of fresh marine medium, achieving approximately 1000 generations over 105 days. Generation counts were estimated based on viable cell numbers at saturation and calculated division rates. Turbidity measurements were taken every 12 h. In the incremental temperature treatment, the temperature was raised by 0.1 °C per day, contingent on observable growth (turbidity). If growth rates decreased significantly, indicated by low turbidity, temperature increases were paused or reduced, and inoculum volume was adjusted from 50 µL to 100 µL as needed. Temperature adjustments over time were recorded and represented as a parabolic curve (Figure 1A). Weekly samples of each evolving population were stored at −70 °C in 80% glycerol. At the experiment’s conclusion, colonies from each of the 42 evolved populations were isolated, and a representative evolved strain from each population was selected for further analysis. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental setup and lineage descent. (A) Inoculation and transfers were performed every 12 h until reaching approximately 1000 generations (eight generations per transfer). The plot illustrates the measured temperature profiles of the incubator over 1000 generations both for the population evolved under highly critical temperature (HCT) and the constant (lower) temperature treatment (CTT) at 37 °C. The mathematical model for HCT is represented as 4.04 + 0.59(t0.5), with an R2 value of 0.8685. (B) The figure depicts the four parental strains from the B. subtilis lineage (left) and their respective descending lines labeled from A to L (HCT) and a to l (CTT_37 °C). Similarly, three parental strains from the B. cereus lineage (right) are depicted along with their corresponding descending lines named from A to L (HCT) and a to l (CTT_37 °C).2.4. Norms of Reaction to Temperature Reaction norms for parental and evolved strains were determined using growth kinetics at various temperatures. Doubling times were calculated from the exponential growth phase to plot the growth rate against temperature. Strains were reactivated from −70 °C stocks on marine medium agar and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. A single colony was used to inoculate 5 mL of marine medium broth and incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Cultures were transferred to achieve exponential phase by subculturing 50 µL into fresh broth for 2 h. Growth measurements were performed using a Bioscreen C plate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) with a 420–580 nm filter. Each well of a 200-well microtiter plate was inoculated with 5 µL of culture and 175 µL of fresh marine medium broth, with three technical replicates per condition. Optical density was recorded every 30 min for 20 h. Growth kinetics were assessed at 17 °C, 27 °C, 37 °C, 41 °C, 43 °C, 46 °C, 49 °C, and 55 °C. Doubling times were calculated using exponential growth models. Reaction norms were compared using t-tests and multiple ANOVA tests (significance level 0.05) in Statgraphics 15.2.06 and R version 3.6.2.2.5. Genome Sequencing and Data Analysis DNA was extracted using the QuickGene DNA tissue kit S (Kurabo Industries LTD., FujiFilm, Osaka, Japan). Sequencing was conducted at Cinvestav-Langebio on an Illumina MiSeq platform at 50× coverage in a paired-end format, with ~180 bp fragment sizes. Paired-end reads were quality-checked using FastQC and trimmed with Trimmomatic. Genome assemblies were generated with SPAdes v3.13.0 and evaluated for quality using N50 and %GC content. Variant calling was performed using GATK Haplotype Caller, and mutations were annotated with Prokka and Patric. Custom scripts were used to integrate Prokka GFF files with VCF data from GATK. Additionally, we employed a “fragmentome” analysis to ensure correct linkage of evolved genomes to their respective parental strains. In this approach, we first generated sets of diagnostic DNA fragments (1000 bp each) from the original ancestral genome sequences. By comparing these fragments against all assembled genomes, we identified those that were uniquely present (i.e., matched only their strain of origin) and thus served as reliable strain-specific genetic markers. Using these diagnostic fragments, we could confidently map evolved reads back to the appropriate parental genome. Unlike standard alignments to a single reference genome, this method provides a lineage-specific signature that helps distinguish closely related ancestral strains and their evolved descendants. This ensures that any potential cross-contamination or mislabeling during experimental evolution or sequencing could be easily detected, as evolved strains must match their diagnostic fragments and not produce hits against other parental genomes. Assembled reference genomes of each representative ancestral strain were obtained, making it possible to generate these strain-specific diagnostic fragments prior to the mapping of evolved sequences. Variants were filtered with a quality threshold of 100, and low-quality mutations (<40) were excluded. Mutation categories included intergenic, genic, indels, and single substitutions. Mutations of interest were validated by Sanger sequencing. Annotated mutations were analyzed using UniProt, GO, and PFAM databases. Gene lists, oligonucleotide sequences, and accession numbers for sequencing data for evolved strains are provided in Supplementary Tables.2.6. Sporulation Capacity Sporulation was assessed on marine medium plates after seven days at room temperature. Samples were stained with malachite green and examined under a Leica 020-518.500 DM/LS optical microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) to confirm the presence or absence of spores.3. Results 3.1. Experimental Evolution at Highly Critical Temperatures and Evolutionary Rescue We conducted experimental evolution to test if the thermal tolerance of vegetative Bacillus strains could be enhanced through gradual temperature increases (Figure 1A). Our study included seven strains from two lineages: three Bacillus cereus strains and four Bacillus subtilis strains, both of which are part of strongly supported monophyletic clades within the Bacillaceae family [32,33]. The wild strains were originally isolated from a temperate hydrological system [29,34], and previous research indicated that these strains are mesophilic, with thermal tolerance largely influenced by lineage [14]. We hypothesized that a gradual increase in temperature would serve as a selective force, potentially expanding the thermal tolerance limits of these strains. With genetic variation among the seven strains, we anticipated diverse adaptive evolutionary strategies. The experimental design involved two temperature regimes: one with a constant temperature of 37 °C and another with incremental increases from 43 °C, aiming for approximately 1000 generations (Figure 1B). Growth at 43 °C initially varied significantly among strains. Specifically, B. cereus strains were highly sensitive, unable to sustain growth beyond 48 h at this temperature, while B. subtilis strains exhibited greater resilience. For B. cereus, growth restoration occurred after lowering the temperature to 42 °C, suggesting an evolutionary rescue mechanism. B. subtilis, in contrast, maintained growth more consistently, allowing for temperature increments of 0.1 °C per day. Temperature increments continued until the strains reached a plateau at 45 °C after approximately 300 generations and then slowed down (Figure 1A). The increment frequency decreased further until no additional adaptation was observed over the last 300 generations, indicating a stabilization of phenotypes. B. subtilis lineages showed a greater overall capacity to survive and adapt than B. cereus, consistent with their initial phenotypic plasticity.3.2. Differences in Plasticity and Critical Temperature Limits To assess changes in thermal tolerance, we compared the reaction norms of evolved and parental strains. Growth kinetics were measured across a temperature range from 17 °C to 55 °C and doubling times were used to construct growth rate curves. 3.2.1. Plasticity and Critical Temperature Limits for Bacillus subtilis Lineages Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate the reaction norms for B. subtilis strains. The Bs_21 and Bs_427 strains demonstrated the most substantial increases in tolerance at higher temperatures. Notably, several Bs_21 lines grew successfully at up to 49 °C, although the results varied among lines (a-b-c-A-C). All Bs_427-evolved lines showed improved growth at 46 °C and 49 °C, regardless of whether they were evolved under constant temperature treatment (CTT) or the high critical temperature (HCT) regime. This suggests that adaptation may be influenced by factors related to the growth medium. A statistically significant reduction in growth was observed for some Bs_427 lines (B and b) at 37 °C.

Horizontal lines at the top of each graph represent the temperature niche of the ancestral strains (black) and strains evolved under CTT (blue) or HCT treatments (red).Figure 3.

Horizontal lines at the top of each graph represent the temperature niche of the ancestral strains (black) and strains evolved under CTT (blue) or HCT treatments (red).Bs_90 exhibited limited improvement in thermal tolerance, with only minor increases in growth at 43 °C for the D-E-d-e lines and barely significant growth at 46 °C for the D-E-F lines. The Bs_90 strain was the least capable of growing at 49 °C, though all evolved lines still outperformed the parental strain. A trade-off was evident in Bs_90, with all evolved lines showing reduced growth at lower temperatures (17–37 °C). In contrast, the laboratory strain Bs_PY79 showed consistent growth across temperatures up to 37 °C. While some high-temperature-evolved lines (J-K-L) demonstrated improved tolerance at 49 °C, they experienced a marked reduction in growth at 17 °C and 27 °C. Interestingly, all Bs_PY79 lines performed similarly to the parental strain at 43 °C, without surpassing its tolerance at 46 °C.3.2.2. Plasticity and Critical Temperature Limits for Bacillus cereus Lineages For B. cereus, the reaction norms revealed minimal improvements post-evolution. Strain Bc_370a exhibited poorer growth than the parental strain, particularly for lines evolved under the HCT regime, which showed decreased growth at 27 °C and 37 °C. Bc_102 demonstrated the best improvements in thermal tolerance among HCT-evolved lines, though CTT-evolved lines generally showed reduced growth compared to the parental strain. Bc_111b presented a slight increase in growth at 43–46 °C for line U, indicating potential thermal adaptation. However, the S-T-U lines (HCT-evolved) exhibited a reduction in fitness across a lower temperature range (17–39 °C), suggesting maladaptive consequences of high-temperature evolution.3.3. Changes in Carrying Capacity (K) and Growth Rate (G) To further understand the adaptive strategies of evolved Bacillus strains, we assessed changes in two critical growth parameters: carrying capacity (K) and specific growth rate (G) at 37 °C and 43 °C. These measurements provided insights into whether the adaptations were multifactorial, impacting not just the growth rate but also the overall population density the cultures could sustain. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of experimental evolution treatments of the traits evaluated for each strain at both 37 °C and 43 °C highlighted the phenotypic responses and adaptations under different temperature regimes (Supplementary Figure S4). 3.3.1. Impact of Temperature on Growth and Carrying Capacity on Bacillus subtilis Lineages Figure 4 shows the normalized results for B. subtilis strains. In Bs_21, significant changes were observed in both K37 and K43, suggesting substantial adaptation, particularly for the D-E-F lines under the high-temperature treatment. Bs_90 displayed pronounced effects in K43, specifically for the D-E-F lines, indicating a temperature-driven adaptation. However, the adaptation appeared limited, as growth improvements did not extend uniformly across all lines. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Growth and carrying capacity in parental and experimentally evolved lines.In Bs_427, we observed increases in both K37 and K43 values compared to the parental strain, reflecting an adaptation that may be driven by the growth medium. The enhanced carrying capacity at 43 °C suggests some degree of temperature adaptation, especially for the D-E-F lines. In Bs_PY79, all evolved lines showed increases in K37 and K43, consistent with medium-driven adaptation rather than temperature-specific changes. Parental strains of Bacillus subtilis are represented by black bars, while their descendant lines under highly critical temperature (HCT) treatment are depicted with red bars and those under constant temperature treatment at 37 °C are shown in blue bars. Each panel comprises charts illustrating the maximum change in growth cultures of lines evolved at a constant low temperature (37 °C) and at a highly critical temperature (43 °C) on the left and carrying capacity (K) at 37 °C and 43 °C on the right.3.3.2. Impact of Temperature on Growth and Carrying Capacity on Bacillus cereus Lineages Figure 5 illustrates the phenotypic changes in B. cereus strains. Bc_370a showed a strong effect on all lines for the parameter G37, implying adaptation to the growth medium rather than temperature. However, a significant impact on K43 was observed only in the M-N-O lines, which underwent high-temperature evolution, indicating some level of thermal adaptation. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Growth and carrying capacity in parental and experimentally evolved lines.In Bc_102, the analysis of K43 revealed stronger adaptation to high temperature in the P-Q-R lines compared to p-q-r. This suggests that thermal adaptation occurred despite the reaction norms not clearly indicating such changes. Specific growth rates (G37) also demonstrated some improvements, although these were less pronounced. For Bc_111b, G43 showed a marked increase across all evolved lines, indicating medium adaptation. However, K43 was significantly higher in the S-T-U lines compared to s-t-u and the parental strain, pointing to an evident effect of temperature adaptation. Parental strains of Bacillus subtilis are represented by black bars, while their descendant lines under highly critical temperature (HCT) treatment are depicted with red bars, and those under constant temperature treatment at 37 °C are shown in blue bars. Each panel comprises charts illustrating the maximum change in growth cultures of lines evolved at a constant low temperature (37 °C) and at a highly critical temperature (43 °C) to the left and the carrying capacity (K) at 37 °C and 43 °C to the right. Table 1 is a summary of the overall impact that evolution at either CTT or HCT had on the B. cereus and B. subtilis lineages. It is evident that a single line, Bs _427, was able to extend its thermal tolerance. None of the lines from the laboratory strain PY79 exhibited changes at any of the temperatures evaluated. All the evolved B. cereus lines reduced their growth capacity compared to the ancestral line. Table 1. Summary of temperature plasticity gained on growth and carrying capacity by the evolved lines.

Changes in Colony Growth, Pigmentation, and Loss of Sporulation in Evolved Lines We evaluated changes in colonial phenotypes by growing parental and evolved Bacillus strains on marine medium agar plates (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). The top rows in the figures show the parental strains, while the lower rows display the six evolved strains (three evolved under the low-temperature treatment, LTT, and three under the highly critical temperature, HCT). Our semi-quantitative assessments revealed significant changes in colony growth among evolved strains. Notably, the B. cereus-evolved lines exhibited a substantial reduction in growth compared to their parental strains, a finding consistent with the reaction norm data. This reduction was particularly evident in lines M, N, Q, S, and T, which underwent HCT treatment. In contrast, the B. subtilis-evolved strains demonstrated more resilience, retaining a higher growth capacity. The observed differences suggest a trade-off in B. cereus, where the selective pressure to endure high temperatures may have compromised their ability to grow rapidly. This trade-off likely represents an adaptive strategy prioritizing survival over growth efficiency. Specifically, the B. cereus strains appear to have evolved a mechanism to endure heat stress by reducing metabolic demands, which could explain their diminished growth rates. Additionally, phenotypic changes were evident in colony pigmentation, especially among the B. subtilis-evolved lines. We observed distinct pigmentation changes in lines A, B, G, and I, indicative of altered metabolic or regulatory pathways as a response to prolonged heat exposure (Supplementary Figure S2). We also noted a loss of sporulation ability in several evolved strains. This was particularly pronounced in the B. cereus HCT-evolved lines, suggesting that the evolutionary pressure to maintain vegetative cell function at high temperatures led to a trade-off, where sporulation capacity was compromised. This finding aligns with the hypothesis that Bacillus strains may sacrifice their ability to form heat-resistant spores to maintain active metabolic processes, which may be crucial for survival in fluctuating but non-lethal high temperatures.3.5. Convergence in Mutations of Strains Evolved at Highly Critical Temperature Reveals the Role of di-C-AMP and Osmolytes in Temperature Tolerance We sequenced the genomes of a representative clone from both the parental and evolved lines (seven parental genomes, 21 evolved genomes at CTT, and 21 evolved genomes at HCT). The genomes were assembled and annotated, and mutations were identified by comparing each evolved genome to its respective parental genome using GATK tools (see Materials and Methods). A workflow of Bioinformatic Analysis of Evolved Genomes and Mutations is shown in Supplementary Figure S3. 3.5.1. Identification and Exclusion of Hypermutator Lines Seven lines exhibited hypermutator phenotypes, characterized by the accumulation of 39 to 219 mutations. These hypermutator lines were excluded from further analysis to avoid skewed results. The hypermutant criterion was established based on a significant deviation from the expected linear distribution of mutation accumulation (Supplementary Figure S5). Hypermutators were identified in both B. subtilis (lines A and G) and B. cereus (lines N, m, q, r, and S), with no apparent correlation to temperature treatment or bacterial lineage, suggesting that the hypermutant phenotype was independent of these factors. These hypermutant lines are depicted as gray labels in Figure 6. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Mutation analysis of strains evolved from the Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus lineages. Each lineage underwent highly critical temperature (HCT, red) treatment and constant temperature treatment (CTT, blue) with three replicates. The diagram illustrates the treatment conditions for each lineage and the total number of mutations observed after the genome sequencing of a colony from the final evolution transfer. Loss of sporulation in evolved lines occurred in strains marked with red or blue triangles. Lines in gray represent hypermutant phenotypes, which were excluded from our analyses to reduce noise in data correlation. Orange asterisks denote convergent mutations at the gene level in the cyclic d-AMP synthase gene (cdaR in B. subtilis or disA in B. cereus), found in independent evolving lines under highly critical temperatures, supporting evidence of positive selection (statistical analysis in the results section).3.5.2. Classification of Mutations in Lines Evolved at 37 °C (CTT) and Above the HCT After excluding hypermutators, mutations were categorized into single-nucleotide substitutions, one to three base indels, and large genomic rearrangements, further classified as intergenic or intragenic. Most of the identified mutations were single-base indels, predominantly affecting open reading frames (ORFs). Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the specific intragenic mutations. Supplementary Table S1 shows a list of all types of mutations in each evolved line. Sporulation loss and the quantification for each mutation type are shown in Supplementary Figure S6. Figure 7.

White squares denote the absence of mutations in the respective gene functional categories. Gray squares are used for all hypermutant strains that were not analyzed. Additionally, red squares highlight genes that have been described as being associated with the observed phenotype.Figure 8.

Additionally, red squares highlight genes associated with the observed phenotype. An orange square specifically highlights di-adenylate synthase-encoding genes.3.5.3. Mutational Analysis in CTT-Evolved Lines In CTT-evolved lines, we identified eight mutations in genes associated with transcription regulation (a-o-p-u lines), six mutations in transport-related genes (a-c-j-p lines), and six in sporulation-related genes (a-d-j-p lines). A significant mutation was detected in strain Bs_a within the SigB regulon, known for its role in thermal stress response [35]. Additional mutations were found in genes involved in DNA replication, methylation, flagellum assembly, metabolite biosynthesis, and cell wall structure (Figure 8).3.5.4. Mutational Analysis in HCT-Evolved Lines In HCT-evolved lines, we found six mutations in transcription-regulation genes (B-F-M-O-Q-T lines) and six in transport genes (B-D-L-M-P-U lines), reflecting the impact on general metabolic processes. Only one mutation affected a sporulation-related gene, lipC, in line B of the Bs_21 strain without causing sporulation defects. Mutations of particular interest included those in glycine–betaine transport genes, crucial for both osmotic and thermal stress resistance [36]. Mutations interrupting the DnaD and RNase H encoding genes were found in line B of the Bs_21 strain. DnaD has been reported to be part of the replisome Turner 2004 and for replication fork progression under replication stress [37]. B. subtilis has two RNase H genes [38]. In bacteria, RNAse H is involved in the removal of RNA in RNA:DNA hybrids, and, in B. subtilis, the absence of one of the RNase H genes results in an accumulation of hybrids upstream of active coding genes with an impact in transcription and increased mutations [39]. Interestingly, strain Bs_B has 37 mutations, one of the most numerous in evolved lines (Supplementary Table S1). We also identified mutations in arginine metabolism genes linked to thermal stress in B. subtilis [35] and inositol metabolism genes known for their thermoprotective properties [40]. A chi-squared test comparing five thermal stress-associated mutations in HCT-treated lines to one in CTT-treated lines suggested a significant temperature-dependent effect.3.5.5. Uncovering of di-Adenylate Cyclases (DACs) in Temperature Adaptation A noteworthy finding was the emergence of mutations in genes encoding di-adenylate cyclases (DACs), observed exclusively in HCT-evolved lines (Figure 9). DACs synthesize c-di-AMP from ATP, a secondary metabolite involved in growth regulation, membrane stability, glycine-betaine transport, and potassium uptake. We identified three loss-of-function mutations in the disA gene of B. cereus (lines O-P-T) and two in the cdaR gene of B. subtilis (lines D and F), with frameshifts occurring in the first half of the ORFs (Supplementary Figure S7). Binomial tests indicated a statistically significant occurrence of these mutations: a probability of 1.68 × 10−4 for B. cereus and 1.37 × 10−3 for B. subtilis. Given the total number of genes (5200 in B. cereus and 4100 in B. subtilis), these findings suggest a selective advantage for DAC-related mutations under high-temperature conditions. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Convergent evolution in lines evolved at highly critical temperatures revealed cyclic di-AMP as a key player. The figure illustrates convergent evolution observed in lines evolved at highly critical temperature (HCT), highlighting cyclic di-AMP as a significant factor. A red X denotes the proteins predicted to be absent due to gene mutation. Both Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus possess three cyclic di-AMP synthase genes, with two expressed during the vegetative phase and the third restricted to sporulation. In B. subtilis, the mutated gene was cdaR, a regulator of the synthetase gene, while in B. cereus, mutations impacted the disA gene, the synthetase itself. Cyclic di-AMP plays a crucial role in regulating K+ uptake, a critical factor in maintaining osmotic balance, suggesting its role in adapting to heat stress.4. Discussion Our study highlights lineage-specific strategies by using experimental evolution with gradual temperature increases. It reveals significant differences in how Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus lineages evolved thermal tolerance when subjected to gradual temperature increases beyond their thermal niche. B. subtilis strains displayed minimal changes in reaction norms, reflecting their greater inherent phenotypic plasticity, while B. cereus strains showed clear trade-offs, such as reduced growth rates at lower and even higher temperatures, indicating that high-temperature selection imposed a substantial evolutionary cost. These results suggest that larger initial plasticity might buffer against rapid adaptation under short-term experimental conditions. In our study, the B. cereus strains initially struggled under high-temperature stress but managed to stabilize and recover growth within weeks, although, several times, we had to stop the regime of increasing temperature until the final 300 generations of constant high-temperature selection. These strains accumulated more mutations than those of the B. subtilis lineage. This is similar to what Mongold et al. [28] observed for E. coli growth at the limit of their niche temperature and suggests that evolutionary rescue mechanisms were at play, allowing the strains to persist despite the harsh conditions. The concept of evolutionary rescue is particularly relevant to our observations. Evolutionary rescue occurs when adaptive genetic changes enable populations to recover from near extinction under severe environmental stress [41,42]. While B. subtilis benefited from its broad thermal tolerance, B. cereus needed substantial genetic adjustments to cope with high temperatures. This observation raises critical questions about the role of plasticity in evolutionary dynamics. Does higher plasticity hinder adaptation by reducing selective pressure, or does it enable immediate survival, allowing for gradual genetic changes? Our data support the notion that short-term evolution favors species with inherent plasticity, while long-term selection can drive adaptive genetic changes in species with less initial plasticity. B. subtilis can be considered to possess more thermal plasticity compared to B. cereus. This conclusion aligns with previous findings by Hurtado et al. [14], which highlighted differences between the B. cereus and B. subtilis lineages in their upper tolerance limits, comparing strains from a thermal spring to those from a temperate lagoon. In this study, only B. subtilis-evolved lines exhibited better growth than the parental strain at the HCT. At the same time, three of four B. subtilis lineages surpassed their ancestral strain’s tolerance limit even at 49 °C. However, it is essential to note that the B. subtilis lines evolved at 37 °C were also able to increase their thermal limit. The pressure of maintaining continuous growth in this particular medium impacted the metabolism that favored thermal tolerance. This is concordant with the change in carrying capacity that resulted from the experimental evolution, particularly for the B. subtilis lines, for which higher carrying capacity changes occur in all lines, whether evolved at 37 °C or at high temperature. This contrasts with B. cereus lines, for which only the lines evolved at higher temperatures exhibit increased carrying capacity under heat stress. These results suggest a shift in metabolism. Accordingly, the expression of proteins that provide stress tolerance or the capacity to adapt to new environmental conditions rapidly is expected to be at the expense of growth-related proteins, reducing the instantaneous growth rate [43]. Finally, adaptation at high temperatures came with trade-offs, as evidenced by poorer growth at lower temperatures. This was observed for B. cereus lines but not for B. subtilis. Our results showed decreased fitness of some of the evolved B. cereus lines (Bc111 and Bc370) at what was the ancestral strain’s optimal growth temperature, as a trade-off for adapting to high temperatures. This supports evolutionary theory, which suggests pleiotropic effects, where genes affecting multiple traits may constrain adaptation and result in maladaptation [44]. Genetic analysis revealed that mutations in genes involved in osmolyte metabolism and heat-shock responses played critical roles in thermal tolerance. For instance, arginine and trehalose metabolism mutations were associated with improved thermal resilience. Arginine biosynthesis is known to be induced under heat stress [35], and trehalose has been suggested to act as a thermoprotectant, stabilizing proteins and membranes [45]. These mutations differ from those described in Ref. [46] from an experimental evolution experiment with B. subtilis, with a temperature regime of 50 °C. Sequencing revealed mutations in genes encoding proteins associated with pathways known to be involved in heat stress response (hrcA, ftsH) and other stress proteins (relA and sigW). We do not expect to find mutations in genes involved in the thermal response, such as those described by Hecker et al. (1996) [36] and Helmann et al. (2001) [35], which, if mutated, would be expected to reduce tolerance to temperature. A novel and significant finding of our study was the convergence of mutations in DAC genes in several strains in both lineages. DAC genes are involved in the synthesis of c-di-AMP. Both B. cereus and B. subtilis possess three genes for the synthesis of c-di-AMP, DisA, and CdaA function in the vegetative phase, while CdaS is sporulation-specific [47]. Most studies have been carried out in B. subtilis, and it is known that the activity of CdaA is modulated by CdaR. c-di-AMP is essential for the growth of B. subtilis and DisA and CdaA contribute to modulating different DNA damage responses during exponential growth [48]. The parallel occurrence of mutations in DAC genes (cdaR in B. subtilis and disA in B. cereus, Figure 9) is intriguing. Several lines of evidence suggest that the di-adenylate cyclase CdaA is part of the conserved essential cda-glm module involved in cell wall metabolism. Notably, this molecule regulates potassium transport and osmotic balance [49]; when bacteria are challenged with high osmolarity, they acquire increased resistance to high temperature and oxidative stresses. The high-osmolarity-dependent increase in thermotolerance has two manifestations: the elevation of the upper limit of the growth temperature and enhanced survival at otherwise lethal high temperatures [50]. Although c-di-AMP is involved in many essential pathways, to participate in virulence and osmotic stress, it has not been implicated in thermal stress. The parallel occurrence of mutations in DAC genes (cdaR in B. subtilis and disA in B. cereus, Figure 9) strongly suggests its role in heat stress tolerance. Our results suggest a lineage-specific evolution in the modulation of the c-di-AMP regulation. In either case, potassium uptake is likely involved in mitigating membrane destabilization caused by high temperatures. In B. subtilis and many other bacteria, a sudden increase in the intracellular potassium concentration is the first response to osmotic stress [51]. Thus, the control of potassium homeostasis by c-di-AMP might also be part of a larger picture of the regulation of osmoadaptation. It has been shown that a variety of compatible solutes (i.e., glycine–betaine, proline) serve as heat protectants for B. subtilis. B subtilis has several redundant transporters, such that a mutation is one of the transporters that has no impact on heat stress [52] on molecular adaptation regardless of whether it restores physiological and molecular processes from a stressed state back toward the unstressed, wild-type state, or whether it instead tends to drive the evolution of novelty [53]. Previous studies have suggested the former because studies have shown that E. coli adapts to high-temperature stress (42.2 °C) by restoring both gene expression [54,55] and phenotypic characteristics [27] toward that of the unstressed ancestor. We think that expanding the thermal niche requires both adapting gene expression to a new threshold, as the previous level is inadequate for the permanent extra-limit temperature stress and the novelty to withstand permanent stress. In this sense, we suggest that cells regulate the levels of c-di-AMP to fit the novel stressful conditions. These findings open up new avenues for understanding the role of c-di-AMP in bacterial heat stress response. Our experimental design, starting with two species and multiple strains, allowed us to explore the potential for parallel evolution [56] and identify multiple pathways leading to thermal tolerance. Parallel evolution, defined as the independent evolution of the same phenotype or genotype in response to identical selection pressures, provides insights into the predictability and diversity of evolutionary outcomes. In this study, we observed that while mutations affecting c-di-AMP synthesis emerged in all three B. cereus lineages, only one B. subtilis lineage (Bs_90) evolved a similar mutation. This finding suggests that while the modulation of c-di-AMP synthesis is a common and potentially “go-to” solution for thermal tolerance, it is not the only pathway. The presence of c-di-AMP mutations in multiple lineages across species highlights its broad utility, yet the absence of these mutations in some evolved lines underscores the diversity of evolutionary strategies. This observation supports the notion that standing genetic variation provides multiple routes to equivalent phenotypes, with natural selection shaping the most accessible solutions within specific genetic and physiological contexts. Multiple pathways can lead to thermal tolerance, even under identical selective pressures, emphasizing the power of parallel evolution to reveal evolutionary constraints and opportunities. These findings align with the idea that evolution often proceeds along a single pathway within a given lineage but that alternative routes remain viable under different genetic or environmental conditions. By leveraging two species and multiple strains, our study underscores the importance of comparative approaches in experimental evolution for uncovering shared and lineage-specific adaptation mechanisms. Our findings suggest that while different genetic pathways can lead to thermal tolerance, these pathways may converge on similar metabolic routes, such as osmotic protection. Mutations in genes regulating c-di-AMP synthesis highlight one such path, given its role in potassium transport and osmotic balance under stress. However, it is important to acknowledge a significant caveat in our analysis: genome sequencing identifies intragenic mutations that could be associated with the phenotype but cannot infer the impact of mutations in intergenic regions. Additionally, when multiple mutations occur within a genome, it is challenging to discern which specific mutations are responsible for the observed phenotypes. When working with wild strains, it is more challenging to reintroduce single mutations to validate the phenotype. Transcriptomic analyses would be necessary to uncover the overarching metabolic strategies and determine how these mutations integrate into the broader cellular response to thermal stress. Such analyses could reveal differential gene expression patterns and regulatory networks contributing to adaptation, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the metabolic adjustments underlying thermal tolerance. The limited thermal tolerance observed in our study, even after experimental evolution, raises concerns about the capacity of microbial communities to adapt to climate change. Given the vital roles of Bacillus species in biogeochemical cycles, constraints on their thermal adaptability could have cascading effects on ecosystem functions, nutrient cycling, and soil health. Our findings suggest that while some bacterial populations may experience evolutionary rescue, the associated trade-offs could limit their ecological success and impact global processes. It is notable that the three strains within each Bacillus lineage (B. subtilis and B. cereus) exhibited consistent, lineage-specific outcomes. Furthermore, the three independently evolved lines for each strain displayed similar trends in temperature tolerance, despite differences in the underlying mutations driving their responses. This result suggests a strong influence of both genetic background and lineage-specific traits in shaping the adaptive responses to temperature stress in Bacillus species. The consistency in outcomes within each lineage (B. subtilis and B. cereus) highlights that certain inherent genetic or physiological characteristics predispose these lineages to follow specific evolutionary trajectories. Our observations indicate that B. cereus lineages tended to accumulate more mutations yet did not achieve markedly better fitness at higher temperatures, whereas B. subtilis lineages adapted to elevated temperatures with comparatively fewer mutations, suggesting greater inherent thermal plasticity or more efficient physiological and regulatory mechanisms for coping with thermal stress. Several factors may underlie these differences. First, B. subtilis may possess a more robust stress response system, including efficient chaperones, heat-shock proteins, and membrane adaptations that minimize the need for extensive genetic change. Second, differences in metabolic versatility and regulatory network flexibility may enable B. subtilis to rapidly optimize gene expression and protein function at higher temperatures, while B. cereus may rely more on genetic alterations that do not directly translate into fitness gains. Additionally, species-specific genomic architecture and mutation biases could shape distinct evolutionary trajectories, with B. cereus potentially having less efficient DNA repair or a mutational spectrum that fails to confer adaptive benefits under thermal stress. Furthermore, the evolutionary histories and ecological niches of these species influence their baseline adaptability; for instance, the laboratory-adapted B. subtilis strain-like PY79 may have evolved pre-adaptations suited to fluctuating conditions, whereas B. cereus, adapted to more stable environments, struggles to exploit novel thermal niches despite generating substantial genetic variation. For example, such lineage-specific adaptations have been documented by Guinebretière et al. (2008) [57], who showed that different taxonomic groups of B. cereus display lineage-associated thermal profiles ranging from 7 to 50 °C, explaining why B. cereus populations in warm parts of a dairy process differ from those in colder parts [58]. The observed lineage-specific outcomes and convergence within strains underscore the critical role of genetic background in shaping adaptive responses. However, the diversity of underlying mutations leading to similar phenotypic outcomes highlights the unpredictability of evolutionary pathways. This variability suggests that microbial responses to environmental stressors, such as climate change, may be highly context-dependent and difficult to generalize. Each genetic background provides a distinct set of constraints and opportunities, leading to diverse adaptive trajectories even under similar selective pressures. Consequently, this result makes it more challenging to predict how microbial communities, composed of diverse genetic lineages, will respond to global warming. While some lineages may adapt via predictable mechanisms, others may follow entirely different and unforeseen evolutionary paths. This underscores the need for further studies that explore the interplay between genetic background, evolutionary dynamics, and environmental change to better understand and anticipate microbial responses at both the species and community levels. In addition to well-characterized experimental evolution studies in E. coli (e.g., Tenaillon et al. [24]), recent research has increasingly explored evolutionary dynamics in Bacillus and other wild bacterial lineages under various selective pressures. For instance, B. subtilis has served as a model in experimental evolution to investigate adaptation in plant-associated environments and in the presence of competing species. Pomerleau et al. [59] demonstrated that B. subtilis rapidly evolved enhanced root colonization capacity under biotic stress imposed by Pseudomonas species, pinpointing mutations in regulators linked to biofilm development. Likewise, Blake et al. [60] showed that B. subtilis populations adapted to the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana diversified into distinct lineages, with some evolved strains improving their host-specific colonization abilities. These findings highlight how environmental context shapes adaptive trajectories and can promote genetic diversification. Other studies emphasize the role of genetic mechanisms, such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), in shaping adaptation. Slomka et al. [61] found that B. subtilis populations evolving under high-salt conditions acquired extensive foreign DNA, improving salt tolerance via bursts of HGT. Although our study focused on thermal adaptation rather than osmotic stress, these results underscore the importance of both point mutations and gene acquisition in driving evolutionary responses and raise the question of whether thermal adaptation might also draw on similar genetic sources if available. Environmental fluctuations and life-history traits can further influence evolutionary outcomes. Shoemaker et al. [62] reported that the capacity for dormancy (“seed banking”) in B. subtilis alters the trajectory of molecular evolution over extended timescales, increasing genetic diversity and affecting the direction of selection on certain genes. Although our experimental design did not directly examine dormancy states, such findings suggest that the intrinsic traits of species, including the ability to form spores, may shape the pace and path of thermal adaptation. Finally, recent molecular and genomic studies highlight the complexity of responses at the RNA and gene-regulatory levels. For example, Jolley et al. [63] demonstrated that B. subtilis dynamically adjusts its RNA structure in response to temperature changes, potentially providing an additional layer of rapid, non-mutational adaptation. Similarly, Hawkins et al. [64] and Shi et al. [65] explored how essential genes and sporulation-related loci evolve over time, offering insights into how baseline genomic architecture and gene regulatory networks can influence adaptive potential. Taken together, these studies show that Bacillus lineages can evolve through multiple genetic routes—ranging from single-nucleotide changes and HGT events to alterations in regulatory networks—to cope with diverse selective pressures, including thermal stress. They also reveal common themes, such as the role of regulatory mutations and pre-existing physiological traits, which can set certain lineages on more efficient adaptive trajectories. Integrating this broader perspective into our findings suggests that while the mutation rate and the spectrum of mutations we observed may not necessarily correlate with thermal niche expansion, they reflect a complex interplay of genetic background, regulatory flexibility, ecological context, and evolutionary history. By situating our results alongside these other Bacillus and bacterial evolution studies, we gain a more nuanced understanding of how constraints and contingencies influence the adaptive landscape of bacterial populations facing environmental challenges. The experimental constraints of this study, which included the passes for only 1000 generations and laboratory-based conditions, may not fully reflect the complexities of long-term evolutionary dynamics or the ecological interactions that occur in natural settings. Additionally, while we identified several mutations, especially those related to di-adenylate cyclase (DAC) genes, more studies would be necessary to understand their roles. This could involve transcriptomic analysis to better understand gene expression patterns in response to thermal stress. Furthermore, exploring the broader ecological context of these findings, such as how they translate to natural microbial populations and how bacteria respond to other environmental stressors like desiccation or nutrient scarcity, will be essential to evaluate bacterial adaptability and resilience comprehensively.5. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that Bacillus strains exhibit limited thermal adaptation and are lineage-specific, with immediate trade-offs even under prolonged selective pressure. This constrained evolvability poses significant implications for microbial responses to global warming, potentially affecting biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem stability. Understanding these evolutionary limits is crucial as we prepare for the ecological impacts of climate change. This study emphasizes the need for more research into the evolutionary and ecological limits of microbial adaptability to predict and mitigate the broader consequences of climate change on vital biogeochemical processes.Acknowledgments We thank Leonardo Meléndez Cerda for his participation in the amplification and sequencing to validate many of the gene mutations and Antonio Cisneros for photographic work.Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/biology13121088/s1.

To test this notion, Bacillus subtilis cells were cultivated in matched hardware, medium, and environmental conditions either in space flight microgravity on the International Space Station, termed flight (FL) samples, or at Earth-normal gravity, termed ground control (GC) samples. The susceptibility of FL and GC samples was compared to 72 antibiotics and growth-inhibitory compounds using the Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) system. Only 9 compounds were identified by PM screening as exhibiting significant differences (P < 0.05, Student's t test) in FL versus GC samples: 6-mercaptopurine, cesium chloride, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, manganese(II) chloride, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, and trifluoperazine. Testing of the same compounds by standard broth dilution assay did not reveal statistically significant differences in the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) between FL and GC samples. The results indicate that the susceptibility of B. subtilis cells to a wide range of antibiotics and growth inhibitors is not dramatically altered by space flight. IMPORTANCE This study addresses a major concern of mission planners for human space flight, that bacteria accompanying astronauts on long-duration missions might develop a higher level of resistance to antibiotics due to exposure to the space flight environment. The results of this study do not support that notion. KEYWORDS: antibiotic profiling, Bacillus subtilis, International Space Station, phenotype, space flightINTRODUCTION In physical terms, the space flight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation, etc.), causes a number of changes in a microbial cell's immediate surroundings, such as the loss of convective mass and heat transfer and a reduction in mechanical shear force. Alterations in such fundamental physical parameters affect the rates at which gases, nutrients, signaling molecules, and waste products are exchanged between the microbe and its surroundings. Microbes perceive these alterations as environmental stress (the so-called “space flight syndrome”) and mount a complex set of stress responses (1). There is considerable interest in studying the responses of microorganisms to the human space flight environment, driven in part by reports that: (i) astronaut immune function becomes dysregulated during long-term space flight (2–4); (ii) certain pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria appear to exhibit enhanced virulence in space flight (3, 5); and (iii) space flight can alter the antibiotic resistance of some microorganisms (6–8). However, the results of experiments to evaluate the effect of space flight on any particular phenotype appear to differ depending on the microorganism tested and the experimental setup. It is thus becoming evident that the physiological responses of microbes to the space flight environment differ, and that it is unlikely that one single model is sufficient to explain them. Antibiotic resistance in space. One often-quoted consequence of the space flight stress response of microbes is an increased resistance to antibiotics (reviewed in reference 9). Early studies of microbial antibiotic resistance in microgravity focused mainly on transient physiologic changes leading to increased or decreased antibiotic susceptibility (6, 7, 9, 10). An increase in microbial antibiotic resistance in the microgravity environment was concluded from experiments performed on Salyut 7 (10) and the space shuttles Challenger (6) and Discovery (7). In these experiments, the increased antibiotic resistance observed in space was apparently a physiologic, not a heritable genetic, response that was reversible upon return of the microbial cultures to normal gravity (11). However, a recent careful review of the literature regarding antibiotic resistance in space led Taylor to conclude that “the anomalies generated by this confusing body of work can only be completely resolved by further in-flight experimentation undertaken in systematic fashion” (3). In contrast, space flight has been documented to cause genetic alterations (i.e., mutations) leading to antibiotic resistance. In experiments performed on space station Mir and the International Space Station (ISS), it was observed that both the frequency and the spectrum of mutations conferring resistance to the antibiotics streptomycin in Escherichia coli (12) and rifampin in Staphylococcus epidermidis (13) were clearly altered. Experiments on the ISS have demonstrated that horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance plasmids can occur among both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (14). Furthermore, an exchange of microflora has been reported among cosmonauts in ground-based confinement scenarios, among Apollo astronauts, and among Shuttle and ISS crews (reviewed in reference 9). Taken together, these observations may lead to a scenario in which opportunistic pathogens could gain antibiotic resistance, establish residence inside the habitat or in astronauts, and disseminate through the astronaut population. To test the notion that antibiotic resistance becomes enhanced during space flight, we chose to measure the resistance of space- versus Earth-grown bacterial cells to a large battery of antibiotics belonging to several classes with differing modes of action. For this study, we chose to use the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which possesses several advantages as a model organism: (i) it is susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics, (ii) it is easily cultivated and amenable to genetic manipulation, (iii) it forms dormant spores, making it an easy system to prepare for space flight, (iv) it is the best-studied Gram-positive bacterium, and (v) the development of its genetics, genomics, and molecular biology is highly advanced. The advantage of using the well-developed B. subtilis system is that any potential effect of space flight can readily be investigated in further detail. We therefore describe here the phenotypic profiling of B. subtilis in response to 72 different antibiotics and growth inhibitors after growth on the ISS compared to that of matched ground controls.RESULTS PM screening for differential antibiotic resistance in FL versus GC samples. Using Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) plates PM-11C, PM-12B, and PM-13B (Table 1), triplicate B. subtilis flight (FL) and ground control (GC) samples were screened for their resistance to 72 antibiotics and growth inhibitors. Each compound was tested at four different concentrations, and FL samples were compared to GC samples. For the majority of compounds tested (63 of 72), no significant difference was detected in FL versus GC samples by PM screening, and statistically significant differences were detected for 9 of the 72 compounds tested (Table 1). These nine inhibitors were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of FL samples which showed significantly increased resistance compared to GC samples, and the second group consisted of FL samples which showed significantly decreased resistance compared to GC samples.

Data are shown as means ± standard deviations of the areas under the curves (AUCs). *, P ≤ 0.05 by Student's t test (n = 3).Enoxacin. Enoxacin is a broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone family that is no longer used clinically in the United States. It acts primarily by inhibiting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (15). The resistance to enoxacin was observed to be >50-fold higher in FL (area under the curve [AUC] of 2,508 ± 627) than in GC (AUC of 44 ± 58) samples (Table 2). Examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to enoxacin showed that FL cultures were significantly more resistant than GC cultures at the highest enoxacin concentration tested, in well E08 (Fig. 1A).6-Mercaptopurine. The DNA synthesis inhibitor 6-mercaptopurine is primarily used as an anticancer and immunosuppressive drug and is not currently used clinically to treat bacterial infections. However, recent studies have indicated that it can inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium spp. (16, 17). The resistance to 6-mercaptopurine was observed to be ∼2-fold higher in FL (AUC of 3,722 ± 894) than in GC (AUC of 1,835 ± 11) samples (Table 2). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to 6-mercaptopurine revealed that FL cultures were significantly more resistant than GC cultures in the second well tested, C02 (Fig. 1B).Trifluoperazine. Trifluoperazine is an efflux pump inhibitor originally identified as an antipsychotic and anxiolytic drug but has since been shown to exhibit broad-spectrum in vitro antimicrobial activity (18, 19). The resistance to trifluoperazine was observed to be ∼1.8-fold higher in FL (AUC of 3,659 ± 749) than in GC (AUC of 2,018 ± 628) samples (Table 2). Examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to trifluoperazine showed that FL cultures were significantly more resistant than GC cultures at the second concentration tested, in well G10 (Fig. 1C).Compounds with higher resistance in GC samples. GC samples were observed to be significantly more resistant than FL samples to 6 growth inhibitors [lomefloxacin, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, manganese(II) chloride, and cesium chloride] (Table 2; Fig. 2). FIG 2.

Data are shown as means ± standard deviations of the areas under the curves (AUCs). *, P ≤ 0.05 by Student's t test (n = 3); n.d., not detected.Lomefloxacin and nalidixic acid. Lomefloxacin and nalidixic acid are both fluoroquinolone antibiotics belonging to the same family as enoxacin (20) and which also inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (21, 22). The resistance to lomefloxacin was observed to be ∼1.4-fold lower in FL (AUC of 3,222 ± 776) than in GC (AUC of 4,509 ± 135) samples, and the resistance to nalidixic acid was also observed to be ∼1.4-fold lower in FL (AUC of 2,496 ± 200) than in GC (AUC of 3,437 ± 105) samples (Table 2). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to lomefloxacin showed that FL cultures were significantly more sensitive than GC cultures at the highest concentration of lomefloxacin tested, in well B12 (Fig. 2A) and at the third concentration of nalidixic acid tested, in well E11 (Fig. 2B). Note that at the highest concentration of nalidixic acid tested (well E12), FL samples appeared to be more resistant than GC samples. However, we were unable to compare FL versus GC samples statistically, because no metabolic activity was detected in the GC samples (Fig. 2B).Penimepicycline. Penimepicycline is a combination of mepicycline, a derivative of tetracycline which inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit (23), and phenoxymethylpenicillin, a derivative of the cell wall inhibitor penicillin (24); this antibiotic is no longer commercially available. The resistance to penimepicycline was observed to be slightly (∼1.2-fold) but significantly lower in FL (AUC of 3,738 ± 269) than in GC (AUC of 4,400 ± 160) samples (Table 2). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to penimepicycline showed that FL cultures were significantly more sensitive than GC cultures at the second concentration tested, in well B06 (Fig. 2C).Rolitetracycline. Rolitetracycline is also a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline (23). The resistance to rolitetracycline was observed to be slightly (∼1.1-fold) but significantly lower in FL (AUC of 4,556 ± 53) than in GC (AUC of 4,998 ± 167) samples (Table 2). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to rolitetracycline showed that FL cultures were significantly more sensitive than GC cultures at the first concentration tested, in well D09 (Fig. 2D).Cesium chloride. Cesium chloride (CsCl) is known to be toxic to many microorganisms, but its cellular target(s) and mechanism(s) of action are poorly understood (25). The resistance to CsCl was observed to be significantly lower (∼1.13-fold and ∼1.27-fold) in FL than in GC samples at the two highest concentrations tested, exhibiting AUCs of 3,219 ± 68 and 2,467 ± 91 (FL) versus AUCs of 3,462 ± 112 and 3,139 ± 100 (GC), respectively (Table 2). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to CsCl showed that FL cultures were significantly more sensitive than GC cultures at the third and fourth concentrations tested, in wells F03 and F04 (Fig. 2E).Mn(II)Cl2. Growth inhibition by manganese results from its competitive replacement of a magnesium cofactor in essential enzymes (26). Resistance to Mn(II)Cl2 was observed to be slightly lower (∼1.06-fold) in FL (AUC of 5,391 ± 120) than in GC (AUC of 5,713 ± 133) samples (Table 2). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to Mn(II)Cl2 revealed that FL cultures were significantly more sensitive than GC cultures in the third well tested, G07 (Fig. 2F).Additional DNA gyrase inhibitors. We noted above that of the 9 compounds exhibiting differing resistance levels by PM screening in FL versus GC samples, three (enoxacin, lomefloxacin, and nalidixic acid) belonged to the quinolone/fluoroquinolone family of DNA gyrase inhibitors, suggesting that DNA supercoiling may be affected by space flight. The gyrase inhibitors ofloxacin, oxolinic acid, and novobiocin were also included in our initial Omnilog PM screening, but were not identified as exhibiting significant differences in FL versus GC samples (Table 1). When the PM data were examined more closely (Fig. 3), we observed that ofloxacin, oxolinic acid, and novobiocin were not present in PM plates at concentration ranges useful for determining resistance or sensitivity to these antibiotics. In the cases of ofloxacin and oxolinic acid, both FL and GC samples grew equally well at all four concentrations tested (Fig. 3A and B). On the other hand, the growth of FL and GC samples was essentially inhibited completely at all 4 concentrations of novobiocin tested (Fig. 3C). Thus, no conclusions about the relative resistance of FL versus GC samples to these three antibiotics could be drawn from the PM screening experiment. Consequently, we chose to test the resistance of FL versus GC samples to ofloxacin, oxolinic acid, and novobiocin using the broth dilution method as described in the following section. FIG 3. Open in a new tab Resistance profiles of FL (white bars) and GC (gray bars) samples to ofloxacin (A), oxolinic acid (B), and novobiocin (C). Data are shown as means ± standard deviations of the areas under the curves (AUCs). Data were not significantly different (Student's t test, P > 0.05, n = 3). n.d., not detected.IC50s of FL versus GC samples by broth dilution. While PM microplates were very convenient and useful for high-throughput screening of the resistance profiles of FL and GC samples to many antibiotics, they also presented a number of limitations. First, the actual concentrations of the antibiotics present in the PM screening plates are proprietary information. Second, in some instances, the antibiotic concentrations in PM plates were not within a useful range (Fig. 3). Third, not all representatives of each antibiotic class are included on PM plates. For these reasons, we chose to more closely quantify antibiotic resistance levels (50% inhibitory concentrations [IC50s]) of FL and GC samples to a selection of antibiotics using the broth dilution method as described in Materials and Methods. We determined the IC50s of FL and GC samples to antibiotics identified as significantly different in PM plates (6-mercaptopurine, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, nalidixic acid, and trifluoperazine). We also tested quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotics that were included in PM plates but were outside a useful concentration range (ofloxacin, oxolinic acid, and novobiocin). In addition, due to their common clinical use and their inclusion in the ISS pharmacy (27), we also decided to determine the IC50s for the fluoroquinolone antibiotics ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, which were not included in the PM panels used. Each of the 10 antibiotics were screened over a range of concentrations allowing normal growth to complete sensitivity, and IC50s were determined for each sample using normalized A, μ, and AUC. The broth dilution data are presented graphically for ciprofloxacin as an example of how the IC50s were determined for each antibiotic (Fig. 4), and the complete data set of IC50s for all 10 antibiotics is presented in Table 3. Examination of the data revealed no statistically significant differences between the IC50s for FL versus GC samples regardless of the parameter used (A, μ, or AUC) for any of the 10 antibiotics tested (Table 3). FIG 4. Open in a new tab Typical data from broth dilution assays used to compute the IC50s presented in Table 3. Data for ciprofloxacin is presented as an example. Maximum absorbance (A; left), maximum growth rate (μ; center), and area under the curve (AUC; right) are presented for flight (FL; open circles) and ground control (GC; open triangles) samples. Data are averages ± standard deviations (n = 3). Solid circles and triangles denote the computed IC50s for FL and GC samples derived from the growth data.

DISCUSSION Understanding the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the human space flight environment is relevant to long-term human missions to distant exploration targets such as asteroids or Mars (11). In particular, the possibility that space flight increases the resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics and other biocidal compounds has long been of concern to mission planners. In the experiments reported here we measured the antibiotic resistance profiles of B. subtilis cells, grown in the space flight environment onboard the International Space Station and in matched ground control conditions, to a battery of 72 antibiotics and growth inhibitors using Omnilog PM microplates. In PM microplates, no significant difference in the resistance levels between FL versus GC samples was observed for 63 out of the 72 compounds tested (Table 1). Only 9 of 72 antibiotics tested in PM plates demonstrated statistically significant differences in the resistance levels of FL versus GC samples (Table 2). However, the magnitude of differences in FL versus GC resistance to 8 of the 9 antibiotics, while statistically significant, was very modest (2-fold or less) (Table 2). Furthermore, FL samples were more resistant than GC samples to only 3 of the 9 antibiotics, but were more sensitive than GC samples to 6 of the 9 antibiotics tested (Table 2). In PM microarrays, FL samples were dramatically more resistant than GC samples to only one of the 72 antibiotics tested, enoxacin (>50-fold; Table 2). This result will be discussed further below. Taken together, the PM data do not support the generally held contention that growth of microbes under space flight conditions leads to increased antibiotic resistance. We next used standard broth dilution assays to determine the IC50s for 10 clinically relevant antibiotics that warranted closer examination. No statistically significant differences in IC50s were observed between the FL and GC samples for any of the antibiotics tested, regardless of the growth parameter examined (maximum growth achieved [A], maximum growth rate [μ], or AUC) (Table 3). For most of the antibiotics tested, these results were not surprising, given the very slight (2-fold or less) effects seen in the PM microplate assays (Table 2). In the case of only one antibiotic, enoxacin, were the PM and broth dilution results clearly at odds. This discrepancy may be due to the different variables tested in the two assays. In PM microplates, metabolic activity is measured photometrically using a redox dye, whereas in the broth dilution assay, cell growth is measured by turbidity, i.e., by optical density. Regardless, the results of the two assays do not support the notion that space flight increases the antibiotic resistance of microorganisms. We feel obliged to discuss alternative factors that might affect the above conclusion. First, the choice of growth media, culture conditions, test organisms, and space flight hardware can account for differing responses to the space flight environment (reviewed in reference 3). Second, the experimental design we used might deemphasize differences between FL and GC samples. Despite the different environments in which FL and GC samples were grown, the actual antibiotic resistance assays were performed under Earth-bound laboratory conditions. It is possible that during the 24-hour duration of the assays, FL samples might have readapted physiologically to 1× g, thus minimizing differences with the GC samples. While it is difficult to control for this factor, we note a previous space flight experiment in which Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium cells were grown in FL and GC, and FL samples were shown to be more virulent in BALB/c mice on Earth after space flight (28). The results presented here indicate that space flight causes only minimal alterations in the phenotypic response of B. subtilis cells to antibiotic susceptibility, with the possible exception of enoxacin. The probability that any differences seen could have resulted from a genetic change, such as a mutation, is very low. In a separate experiment using the same biological research in canisters (BRIC)-21 FL and GC samples as those tested here, we measured the frequencies of mutations to antibiotic resistance in all of the FL and GC petri dish fixation units (PDFUs) used in this study (data to be published elsewhere). In all 12 samples, the mutation frequencies were less than 10−7 (i.e., less than 1 mutant per 10 million cells). This frequency is much too low to produce an effect on the antibiotic resistance of the bulk population. To gain a more accurate understanding of the response of microbial cells to antibiotics in space, it would be ideal to design experiments for the high-throughput screening of antibiotics directly in the space flight environment. A preliminary step has already been taken in this direction. For example, the resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast to the antifungal agent voriconazole was shown to differ in FL versus GC samples using the free-flying PharmaSat nanosatellite (8); such a design could readily be adapted for high-throughput in-flight antibiotic screening either by a free-flying nanosatellite or by a small semiautonomous payload sent to the ISS. Taken at face value, it would seem that the results of this study imply that there is little cause for alarm regarding the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes during human space flight. However, it should be emphasized that these in vitro experiments exploring antibiotic resistance only touch upon one small facet of the chemotherapy of a potentially infected astronaut. Many aspects of the interplay among the host, the microbe, and the antibiotic (such as modes of entry, routes of pathogenesis, pharmacokinetics, etc.), which have been studied extensively in Earth-bound clinical settings, have yet to be explored in the space flight environment. As a final note, aside from their clinical significance, antibiotics have long been used to probe basic biological processes at the molecular level (such as replication, transcription, translation, membrane and cell wall biogenesis, etc.). From this perspective, it is interesting to note that among the 9 antibiotics flagged by PM screening as showing different sensitivities in FL versus GC samples, 3 belonged to the quinolone/fluoroquinolone class of compounds (lomefloxacin, enoxacin, and nalidixic acid). These compounds inhibit DNA gyrases, which are type II DNA topoisomerases that function to (i) condense DNA in the cell, (ii) maintain DNA under the optimal supercoiled state for gene expression, and (iii) decatenate DNA during chromosome partitioning (29); all three functions of DNA gyrases are essential for cell viability, and moreover, are sensitive to environmental changes. From the above observations, it is attractive to speculate that the growth of cells in the space flight environment may lead to alterations in DNA supercoiling, hence, in global gene expression (30). This notion could be tested directly by measuring the superhelicity of DNA in FL versus GC cells of B. subtilis in a manner similar to that previously described (31).MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strain, medium, and growth conditions. The bacterium used was B. subtilis strain 168 from our laboratory stock collection. The medium used throughout for routine cultivation and plating was Trypticase soy-yeast extract (TSY) medium consisting of (g/liter): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5; yeast extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; final pH 7. For semisolid plates, agar was added at 15.0 g/liter. For the cultivation of space flight and ground control cells in space flight hardware, TSY medium containing 10% (vol/vol) glycerol was prepared by mixing equal volumes of sterile double-strength TSY and sterile 20% (vol/vol) glycerol. This medium was used because it supports cell growth to a high density and was used in a prior space flight experiment (13). Spores of strain 168 were prepared and purified as described previously (32) and were stored at 4°C in deionized water. An examination by phase-contrast microscopy confirmed that the spore preparation was devoid of vegetative cells and contained >99% phase-bright spores. The spore suspension was heat activated (65°C for 20 min) before use. From a working suspension (108/ml) of spores in water, aliquots of 0.1 ml (∼107 CFU) were applied to the bottoms of sterile 60-mm-diameter petri dishes (Falcon catalog no. 1007; Fisher Scientific) and air dried for 48 to 72 h at room temperature protected from light prior to placement in space flight hardware.BRIC space flight hardware. Samples were integrated into biological research in canisters-dual chamber (BRIC-DC) space flight hardware, which has been described in detail previously (33–35). BRIC canisters hold six 60-mm-diameter petri dish bottoms in small subcompartments called petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Each PDFU allows for the injection of medium, referred to as actuation, to initiate bacterial growth. For flight (FL) experiments, 2 BRIC canisters were used, each containing five PDFUs and one HOBO temperature data logger (Onset, Inc., Cape Cod MA). Postflight asynchronous ground control (GC) experiments were conducted using the same hardware and configuration as in the FL experiment. Each PDFU was loaded with a petri dish containing air-dried spores, and 17 ml of sterile TSY plus 10% glycerol medium was loaded into a separate reservoir. To prevent contamination, all reagents and equipment used were sterilized in an autoclave prior to use, and PDFUs were assembled using an aseptic technique within a biosafety level 2 (BSL2)-rated biological safety cabinet.Experimental flight timeline. The BRIC-PDFU payload described above was the 21st BRIC mission to space, and was designated BRIC-21. The payload was launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on the 6th SpaceX cargo resupply mission to the ISS (SpaceX-6 CRS) on 14 April 2015, using the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule configuration. The growth of flight (FL) samples was initiated by the injection of 8.5 ml TSY plus 10% glycerol medium on 20 April 2015 (Fig. 5A), and they were incubated at ambient ISS temperature for 25 h (Fig. 5B). Temperature data were logged at 10-min intervals during the FL experiment. The average temperature recorded during the growth periods in the FL canister was 22.8 ± 0.07°C. Preflight experimentation indicated that under these conditions of medium, temperature, and time, cells grew to the late exponential phase (data not shown). At the end of the incubation period, BRIC canisters were transferred into −80°C freezers, and the HOBO units registered temperatures below 0°C within 60 min (FL) and 80 min (GC) (Fig. 5B). All HOBO units performed nominally for the entire duration of the experiment. On 21 April 2015, growth was terminated by the transfer of the BRIC canisters to the onboard minus eighty-degree laboratory freezer for ISS (MELFI). FL samples were kept frozen for their return to Earth in the Dragon capsule on 21 May 2015 and were maintained in the frozen state until their return to KSC on 1 June 2015 for deintegration. Samples were recovered from BRIC canisters in the frozen state, transported on dry ice to the laboratory, and stored at −80°C. FIG 5. Open in a new tab (A) Actuation of BRIC-21 canister by European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti aboard the ISS. (B) Temperature data recorded at 10-min intervals from BRIC-21 FL (circles) and GC (triangles) samples. Actuation time is denoted by the upward arrow, and the termination of experiment by moving to the −80°C freezer is denoted by the downward arrow. Note that the data are offset by 2°C in order to display both curves.Postflight asynchronous ground control (GC) experiment samples were prepared and treated using the same BRIC-PDFU hardware, configuration, schedule, and temperature profile as in the FL experiment. BRIC-PDFU hardware was incubated in the ISS environmental simulation (ISSES) chamber at KSC, which was programmed to play back the ISS temperature profile recorded by the HOBO data loggers during the flight (Fig. 5B). The average temperature recorded in the GC experiment was 22.8 ± 0.21°C. After 25 h of incubation, the samples were transferred to a −80°C freezer.Antibiotic resistance profiling using phenotype microarray. The determination of antibiotic resistance patterns among FL and GC samples was performed using the Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) system (Biolog, Inc., Hayward, CA) using the manufacturer's recommend plates, reagents, and protocols. Frozen FL and GC cultures were partially thawed at room temperature, and then the partially frozen cell slurries were transferred into sterile 15-ml conical centrifuge tubes and placed immediately on ice to complete the thawing. The culture volumes recovered were recorded for later calculations. Each culture was mixed thoroughly by vortexing, and an aliquot was removed for viable cell count determination. Cells were recovered by centrifugation (7,000 × g for 20 min at 0°C) in a benchtop centrifuge, and cell pellets were immediately suspended by vortex mixing in 5 ml of inoculating fluid (IF) IF-10b (Biolog, Hayward, CA). Cells were then diluted with fresh IF-10b until the suspension reached an optical density at 660 nm (OD660) of 0.08 in a UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu model UV 1800). From a prior calibration curve, we determined that this OD660 in a standard 1-cm-path-length cuvette corresponded to 81% transmittance in Biolog's turbidimeter (data not shown). Omnilog PM plates PM-11C, PM-12B, and PM-13B are 96-well microtiter plates, with each plate containing 4 different concentrations of 24 different antibiotics or growth-inhibiting compounds. (Note that the concentration of each compound in each well is information proprietary to Biolog, Inc.) A complete list of the 72 compounds in these plates is available at http://www.biolog.com/pdf/pm_lit/PM11-PM20.pdf. An inoculation mixture was prepared consisting of (per plate): 10 ml of IF-10b, 1 ml of PM additive (12×), 0.12 ml of dye mix H, and 0.88 ml of cell suspension. Each well was inoculated with 100 μl of the inoculation mixture and incubated at 37°C for 24 h in the Omnilog PM instrument (Biolog). Cell metabolism was monitored by the change in color of a redox dye. In the instrument, absorbance readings from all wells were automatically recorded at 15-min intervals and assigned arbitrary values (“Omnilog units”) from 0 to 350. All assays were performed using triplicate FL and GC samples. Antibiotics and growth inhibitors that displayed significant differences between FL and GC samples in the PM system were chosen for closer examination by the broth dilution assay, described below.Antibiotic resistance levels using broth dilution assays. The quantification of antibiotic resistance was determined by the broth dilution assay (36). Briefly, frozen FL or GC samples were thawed on ice as described above and immediately inoculated into liquid TSY plus 10% glycerol medium containing various concentrations of each test antibiotic in a 96-well microtiter plate format. To prevent evaporation, plates were sealed with gas-permeable membranes (Breathe-Easy membrane; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Plates were placed in a microplate absorbance spectrophotometer (model ELx808; BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT) set at 37°C. Optical density at 620 nm (OD620) was recorded at 15-min intervals for 24 h. All assays were performed using triplicate FL and GC samples.Data set properties and analyses. The complete PM data set consisted of 2 conditions (FL versus GC) × 3 replicates × 3 PM plates × 96 wells per plate × 96 kinetic time points per well, resulting in a total of 165,888 data points in 1,728 kinetic curves. Data were exported into Microsoft Excel and the statistical environment R (37) for further analysis. R packages were obtained from the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) at https://cran.r-project.org/. Using the R package grofit (38), four growth models (logical, gompertz, gompertz.exp, and Richards) were fit to the data points of each curve. From the model, the software could calculate four statistical parameters for quantifying properties within each curve: length of the lag phase (λ), maximum growth rate (μ), maximum growth achieved (A), and area under the curve (AUC). Because the AUC is dependent upon the other three parameters, and thus is more broadly discriminatory, we chose the comparison of AUC values for the initial screening between FL and GC samples by PM. The complete broth dilution data set consisted of 2 conditions (FL versus GC) × 3 replicates × 10 antibiotics × 97 time points per curve, for a total of 5,820 data points within 420 curves. Best-fit curves were generated by spline interpolation using the R grofit software gcFitSpline, and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was computed for each sample over a range of antibiotic concentrations. IC50s were determined using A, μ, and AUC for every well. The parameters A and μ were included to separately analyze the dose response of the maximum growth rate and maximum OD of FL and GC samples. The three parameters were normalized by subtracting the corresponding parameter from the blank well and dividing by that from the control (i.e., no antibiotic) well. The normalized values were transferred into GraphPad Prism version 7.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). GraphPad then calculated the IC50 for each antibiotic by fitting to each sample a log(inhibitor) versus response nonlinear regression model with variable slope. All statistical analyses comparing FL and GC samples were performed using Student's t tests contained in the R statistical package stats (37). Differences with P values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the BRIC-21 payload development team (D. Dimapilis, A. D. Flowers, C. Grosse, J. Harp, D. Houze, H.

    "abstract": "Abstract The effect of Bacillus subtilis exposure to the human spaceflight environment on growth, mutagenic frequency, and spectrum of mutations to rifampicin resistance (RifR) was investigated. B. subtilis cells were cultivated in Biological Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) on two separate missions to the International Space Station (ISS), dubbed BRIC-18 and BRIC-21, with matching asynchronous ground controls. No statistically significant difference in either growth or in the frequency of mutation to RifR was found in either experiment. However, nucleotide sequencing of the RifR regions of the rpoB gene from RifR mutants revealed dramatic differences in the spectrum of mutations between flight (FL) and ground control (GC) samples, including two newly discovered rpoB alleles in the FL samples (Q137R and L489S). The results strengthen the idea that exposure to the human spaceflight environment causes unique stresses on bacteria, leading to alterations in their mutagenic potential. Keywords: antibiotic resistance, mutation, rpoB, rifampicin, Bacillus subtilis, spaceflight",
    "introduction": "Introduction In contrast to the classical view that mutations are random, a growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stresses in microbes can alter both the mutation rate and the mutagenic spectrum, supplying an increased variety of mutational outputs for selection to operate on and hence shaping the evolutionary trajectory of organisms (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002; Foster, 2007; Nicholson and Park, 2015; Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b). This phenomenon, dubbed Stress-Induced Mutagenesis (SIM), has been most eloquently demonstrated in the recent work of Maharjan and Ferenci (b). E. coli cells were grown in chemostats under 5 different stresses, (limitation for carbon, phosphate, nitrogen, oxygen, or iron) or in a nutrient-rich environment, and loss-of-function mutations in the cycA gene leading to cycloserine resistance (CycR) were quantified, isolated, and subjected to fitness measurements (Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b). Although only 2 out of 5 stresses led to a significant increase in the mutation rate to CycR, all stresses resulted in distinct spectra of mutations in cycA conferring a variety of alterations in fitness of the resulting mutants (Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b). The human spaceflight environment presents its own unique set of physical stressors, including cosmic radiation, microgravity, vibration, electromagnetic fields, and altered atmospheric compositions. Numerous studies have explored how microorganisms respond physiologically to spaceflight exposure (reviewed extensively in Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015). However, very few studies have asked whether microbial exposure to spaceflight might lead to SIM (Yatagai et al., 2000; Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). Such studies are relevant to astronaut health risk assessment, given the role that microbial SIM may play in the emergence of antibiotic resistance or modifications to the astronaut microbiome. Long-duration human missions through interplanetary space to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars are currently being planned (NASA, 2015), and both the National Research Council (NRC) and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) have assigned a high priority to studies aimed at better understanding astronaut health risks during space exploration. NASA has implemented a three-phase approach to its long-term goal of the human exploration of Mars1. The first phase, to be accomplished in the present-to-mid-2020’s time frame, is dubbed the “Earth Reliant” phase, focusing on research aboard the International Space Station (ISS), currently the only microgravity platform for the long-term testing of crew health systems and technologies needed to decrease reliance on Earth. To date, only two studies have been performed exploring the notion that exposure of microbes to the stresses of the human spaceflight environment might result in SIM. First, B. subtilis spores containing a plasmid encoding the Escherichia coli rpsL gene were exposed to spaceflight in space station Mir vs. matched ground controls (Yatagai et al., 2000). The frequency of mutations in rpsL leading to spectinomycin resistance (SpcR) was found not to be significantly different between spaceflight and ground control samples, but sequencing of the mutant rpsL genes from 25 spaceflight and 38 ground control samples showed distinct differences in the spectrum of mutations leading to SpcR (Yatagai et al., 2000). Second, the frequency and spectrum of chromosomal mutations to rifampicin resistance (RifR) was measured in Staphylococcus epidermidis cells flown aboard the ISS and compared to matched ground controls (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). In this experiment the frequency of mutation to RifR was observed to be significantly (24-fold) greater in the spaceflight samples. Sequencing of the rpoB gene from 67 spaceflight and 57 ground control RifR mutants also showed that the spectrum of mutations to RifR was clearly different in the flight vs. the ground control samples (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). From our previous results (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016), we concluded that RifR was a good model to investigate SIM in spaceflight for a broad variety of microorganisms. Resistance to rifampicin derives from mutations within a small region of the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNA polymerase (Wehrli et al., 1968; Jin and Gross, 1988). This region corresponds to the Rif binding site of β (Campbell et al., 2001) and is highly conserved among prokaryotes (Severinov et al., 1993). Single-nucleotide substitutions in rpoB leading to RifR have been shown to alter the global patterns of transcription, and resulting phenotypes, in several bacteria including Neisseria meningitidis, Streptomyces lividans, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus (Hu et al., 2002; Maughan et al., 2004; Perkins and Nicholson, 2008; de Knegt et al., 2013; Colicchio et al., 2015; Villanueva et al., 2016). It is thus possible that mutation to RifR could alter the response of microbes to the spaceflight environment. For the present study we chose to use as the test organism the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis, which possesses several advantages as a model organism: (i) it is easily cultivated and amenable to genetic manipulation; (ii) it forms dormant spores, making it an easy system to prepare for spaceflight; (iii) it is the best-studied Gram-positive bacterium; and (iv) development of its genetics, genomics, and molecular biology is highly advanced. Thus, using the well-developed B. subtilis system will facilitate the investigation in further detail of any potential novel mutations isolated in rpoB.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Bacterial Strain, Media, and Growth Conditions The strain used was Bacillus subtilis strain 168 (trpC2) from the authors’ laboratory collection. Medium used throughout was trypticase soy yeast extract (TSY) medium consisting of (g/L): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5; yeast extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; final pH 7. For semisolid plates, agar was added to TSY at 15.0 g/L. For FL and GC experiments, glycerol was added to TSY liquid medium to 10% (v/v) final concentration, resulting in TSYG medium. As appropriate, the antibiotic rifampicin (Rif; Sigma–Aldrich) was added to TSY at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL. B. subtilis spores were routinely prepared by cultivation in liquid Schaeffer Sporulation Medium (Schaeffer et al., 1965) at 37°C with vigorous aeration. The culture was harvested when phase-contrast microscopic examination revealed that it consisted of >90% free spores, usually after 3–4 days of incubation. Sample Preparation Spores were purified by lysozyme treatment, buffer washing, and heat shock (80°C, 10 min) as described previously (Nicholson and Setlow, 1990). Spores were determined by phase-contrast microscopy to be >99% free of cell debris and unsporulated cells, and were stored at 4°C in deionized water. The working suspension of spores contained 108 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL. Aliquots of 0.1 mL (∼107 CFU) of the suspension were applied to the bottoms of sterile 60-mm diameter Petri dishes (Falcon Cat. No. 1007) and air-dried for 48–72 h at room temperature prior to use. BRIC Spaceflight Hardware The experiments described here utilized Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) spaceflight hardware, which has been described in detail previously (Paul et al., 2012). BRIC canisters can accomodate up to six samples. In these experiments, each BRIC was loaded with 5 Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs). Each PDFU was loaded with a 60-mm Petri dish containing air-dried spores, and sterile TSYG medium was loaded into a separate reservoir. To prevent contamination, all reagents and equipment used were sterilized prior to use and PDFUs were assembled using aseptic technique within a Class 2 Biological Safety Hood. In the sixth sample chamber of each BRIC was placed a HOBO R temperature data logger (Onset Computer Co., Bourne, MA, United States). Post-flight asynchronous GC experiments were conducted using the same hardware and configuration as in the flight experiment. Flight (FL) and Ground Control (GC) Timelines Bacillus subtilis samples were flown on two separate experiments to the ISS, the 18th and 21st BRIC missions to space, designated BRIC-18 and BRIC-21. FL samples were launched on the 3rd and 6th SpaceX Cargo Resupply missions to the ISS (SpaceX-3 and SpaceX-6 CRS, respectively), using the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule configuration. Pertinent information regarding the activity timelines of these two missions can be found in Table 1. Growth of samples was initiated in-flight and samples incubated for 122 h (BRIC-18) or 25 h (BRIC-21) before transfer to the onboard -80°C freezer. Frozen samples were returned to Earth in the Dragon capsule and were maintained in the frozen state until return to KSC for de-integration and further processing. Table 1.

Samples were incubated in the KSC ISS Environmental Simulation Chamber following the temperature regimes recorded during the flights (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016; Morrison et al., 2017) and growth was terminated by transfer to a -80°C freezer, where samples were stored until further processing. Post-experiment Sample Processing In the BRIC-18 experiment, both FL and GC BRIC canisters were transferred from storage at -80°C to a +4°C refrigerator and samples allowed to thaw completely overnight. Liquid samples in Petri dishes were recovered from the PDFUs, transported to the laboratory on ice and further processed immediately. In the BRIC-21 experiment, both FL and GC samples were recovered from BRIC canisters in the frozen state, transported on dry ice to the laboratory, and stored at -80°C for later processing. Frozen samples were then thawed on ice, resuspended and processed immediately. In all instances, cells were detached from interior plate surfaces and resuspended using sterile disposable rubber spatulas. Resuspended cultures were transferred to sterile 15-mL conical centrifuge tubes, and the total recovered volume was measured. For viable counts, aliquots from cultures were diluted serially tenfold in TSY medium, dilutions plated on TSY plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h to obtain CFU/mL. To obtain the total CFU per PDFU, the CFU/mL were multiplied by the volume of liquid recovered. To select for RifR mutants, the remainder of each culture was concentrated by centrifugation, plated without dilution onto TSY + Rif plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24–48 h. The frequency of mutation to RifR was calculated by dividing the total number of RifR mutants by the total number of viable cells from each sample. Individual RifR mutants were streak-purified on TSY + Rif plates and stored at -70°C in TSY + 25% glycerol, then processed for DNA sequencing. DNA Sequencing and Analyses Primers used for PCR amplification of two RifR regions of the B. subtilis rpoB gene are listed in Table 2. The corresponding rpoB regions were amplified directly from cells using 3 μL of culture from their respective glycerol stocks as DNA template, using the GoTaq® PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) and the following thermal cycling conditions: 95°C, 2 min for the initial denaturation step, then 36 cycles of (95°C, 30 s; 55°C, 1 min; 72°C, 2 min), followed by a final elongation step (72°C, 5 min). PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (BRIC-18) or at GeneWiz LLC (South Plainfield, NJ, United States) (BRIC-21). Multiple rpoB sequences were aligned using the online Clustal Omega server2 (Li et al., 2015) to identify the position of mutations relative to the wild-type rpoB sequence obtained from B. subtilis laboratory strain 168. In order to confirm the identity of novel (i.e., never-before-isolated) rpoB mutations, the corresponding region of the newly sequenced rpoB allele was amplified by PCR from each mutant and the resulting amplicon was introduced by transformation into competent cells of RifS B. subtilis strain WN547 using standard procedures as described previously (Boylan et al., 1972; Nicholson and Maughan, 2002). From selected RifR transformants, the corresponding region of rpoB was again PCR amplified and sequenced to confirm that the mutation had been transferred. Table 2.

    "results": "Results Temperature Data in FL vs. GC Experiments Temperature data were logged at 10-min intervals during the FL and GC experiments and a summary of the data is presented in Table 3. A detailed presentation of the temperature data can be found elsewhere (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016; Morrison et al., 2017). Table 3.

Because the data was determined not to be normally distributed, it was analyzed using non-parametric statistics. In the BRIC-18 experiment, cells grew to average total CFU per PDFU of 3.98 × 106 (FL) and 1.10 × 107 (GC); these values were determined not to be significantly different (Figure 1). Ground-based growth kinetic experiments revealed that the rather low cell yield in the BRIC-18 mission was due to the prolonged incubation time (122 h) (data not shown). For the BRIC-21 mission, an increased cell yield was needed to provide sufficient sample mass for additional antibiotic susceptibility testing (Morrison et al., 2017) and RNA-seq analysis (to be published elsewhere). In ground experiments preparatory for the BRIC-21 mission, it was determined that an incubation time of 25 h resulted in higher cell yields, and that 25-h cultures were in the late-logarithmic to early stationary phase (data not shown). Accordingly, statistical comparison of the total CFU obtained between the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 flights uncovered that cells grew to significantly higher titers in the BRIC-21 experiment, to an average total CFU per PDFU of 1.72 × 108 (FL) and 2.13 × 108 (GC) (P < 0.005). As found in the BRIC-18 mission, FL vs. GC titers within the BRIC-21 mission were determined to be not significantly different (Figure 1). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Box plots depicting growth (presented as log10 Total CFU) of B. subtilis FL (cyan and blue boxes) and GC (light and dark green boxes) samples during the BRIC-18 (left panel; n = 5) and BRIC-21 (right panel; n = 7) experiments. nsd, not significantly different (Kruskal–Wallis, P > 0.05). Mutation Frequencies to RifR in FL vs. GC Samples The mutation frequency to RifR was determined for both FL and GC samples recovered from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments (Figure 2). Because the data were determined not to be normally distributed, they were analyzed using non-parametric statistics. In the BRIC-18 experiment, cells exhibited an average mutation frequency of 6.9 × 10-6 (FL) and 7.54 × 10-6 (GC); these values were determined to be not significantly different (Figure 2). In the BRIC-21 experiment, cells exhibited an average mutation frequency of 6.11 × 10-8 (FL) and 1.94 × 10-8 (GC); again, these values were determined to be not significantly different (Figure 2). However, statistical comparison of the mutation frequencies to RifR obtained between the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 flights revealed that cells demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of mutation to RifR in the BRIC-18 experiment (P < 0.007). Again, this may result from differences in the incubation times to which the cells were subjected–122 h in BRIC-18 vs. 25 h in BRIC-21–due to the well-documented phenomenon of stationary phase mutagenesis in B. subtilis (Robleto et al., 2007).

Spectrum of RifR rpoB Mutations in FL vs. GC Experiments The N-cluster and Clusters I, II, and III of the rpoB gene were PCR amplified from B. subtilis strain 168 and from the RifR mutants obtained from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 FL and GC experiments. Nucleotide sequences were determined from a total of 56 FL and 15 GC samples from BRIC-18 (Table 4) and from a total of 72 FL and 38 GC samples from BRIC-21 (Table 5). Both sets of data are summarized graphically in Figure 3. Examination of the data revealed several striking differences in the mutational spectrum within rpoB between the FL and GC samples. Table 4.

Each box represents an independently sequenced mutation, and the corresponding amino acid alteration is indicated. Data from both the BRIC-18 (cyan and light green boxes) and BRIC-21 (blue and dark green boxes) are presented.N-Cluster Historically, the only mutation conferring RifR previously identified in the N-cluster of B. subtilis rpoB was a G-to-T transversion causing the amino acid change V135F; this mutation was previously found at approximately equal frequencies in spores exposed either to Earth or simulated Mars conditions (Perkins et al., 2008). In the present experiments, the V135F mutation was observed only in BRIC-21 GC samples (Figure 3 and Table 5). However, a novel mutation, Q137R, was detected in the N-cluster in 4 out of 56 BRIC-18 FL samples, but in none of the GC samples (Figure 3 and Table 4). This novel mutation was confirmed by retransformation and resequencing as described in Materials and Methods. The Q137R mutation was found in two separate FL PDFUs, suggesting that the spaceflight environment may be conducive to its formation (Tables 4, 6). Table 6.

Each class of mutation was scored as either present (X) or absent (blank) in the corresponding PDFU. Totals are tabulated in the rightmost two columns.Cluster I The majority of RifR mutations in both FL and GC samples were found to occur in Cluster I, in agreement with numerous prior studies. Historically, the most common amino acid changes in Cluster I leading to RifR occur at amino acids Q469, H482, and S487 (Severinov et al., 1993; Campbell et al., 2001; Nicholson and Maughan, 2002; Perkins et al., 2008). In our experiments, the spectrum and frequency of mutations appeared to be similar at these three amino acids (Figure 3), with the exception that a single never before isolated mutation (H482N) was identified among the GC samples from BRIC-18 (Figure 3 and Table 4). However, in FL samples from the BRIC-21 experiment we found a large number of mutations (32/72) at L489, consisting exclusively of T-to-C transitions resulting in the amino acid change L489S (Figure 3 and Table 5). This novel mutation was confirmed by retransformation and resequencing as described in Section “Materials and Methods.” The L489S mutation was found in two separate FL PDFUs, also suggesting that the spaceflight environment may be conducive to its formation (Tables 5, 6). In addition to amino acids Q469, H482, S487, and L489 we found within Cluster I two differences in the spectrum of mutations in rpoB. First, at amino acid D472, we observed no mutations in FL samples, but in BRIC-18 GC samples we observed two different mutations; a G-to-T transversion at the first position and an A-to-T transversion at the second position of codon D472, leading to the deduced amino acid changes D472Y and D472V, respectively (Figure 3). Second, no mutations were found in GC samples at amino acid A478, but in the BRIC-18 FL samples 8/59 of the total mutations consisted of a C-to-T transition at the second codon position resulting an A478V substitution (Figure 3 and Table 4).RifR Mutations Not Mapping to Known rpoB Regions Historically, 4 regions in rpoB have been associated with RifR in the model organism E. coli, designated as the N-cluster and Clusters I, II, and III (Figure 3) (reviewed in Severinov et al., 1993, 1994). These clusters have been defined by the locations of RifR mutations as codons 127-135 (N-cluster), 463-489 (Cluster I), and 519-532 (Cluster II) (B. subtilis coordinates). To date, in B. subtilis RifR mutations have never been identified in Cluster III or in intervening regions. However in 2 PDFUs from the BRIC-18 mission were isolated RifR mutants for which no mutation in rpoB was found by sequencing the classic N-cluster or Clusters I, II, and III (Table 4). This phenomenon has been reported before (Ahmad et al., 2012) and raises 2 formal possibilities. First, these mutations conferring RifR might reside in rpoB but outside the Clusters N, I, II, or III (it should be noted that our primer sets covered only ∼38% of the complete rpoB sequence; Figure 3). Second, the mutations may be located outside rpoB entirely; low-level RifR has been previously reported in mutants with altered permeability or efflux (Goldstein, 2014). In any event, because these mutants appeared in FL PDFUs, they may represent new allele(s) and warrant further investigation. Distribution of RifR rpoB Mutations by PDFU Examination of Tables 4, 5 indicated that in some PDFUs an unusually high number of repeats of the same RifR mutant were found. For example, 16 out of 16 RifR mutants sequenced from BRIC-18 FL PDFU-5 (Table 4), and 12 out of 13 mutants sequenced from BRIC-21 GC PDFU-3 (Table 5), were Q469R. These data suggested that some of the populations in both FL and GC samples contained “jackpots,” i.e., cultures in which the progeny of early arising RifR mutants became over-represented in the final culture (Foster, 2006). We therefore analyzed the data by counting each type of mutation as either “present” (at least once) or “absent” in each PDFU, the results of which are presented in Table 6. When re-examined in this way, differences in the distribution of RifR mutants in FL vs. GC samples were still apparent. For example, the Q137R and L489S mutations were each found in 2 separate FL PDFUs, but in zero GC PDFUs (Table 6). In contrast, mutations leading to Q469R predominated in both FL (6/6) and GC (5/6) PDFUs, suggesting that occurrence of this specific mutation is not responsive to spaceflight exposure (Table 6). Transitions vs. Transversion in FL and GC Samples As reported above, differences were observed in the location of rpoB mutations in FL vs. GC samples in B. subtilis RifR mutants. These observations prompted us to examine the nature of nucleotide changes (i.e., transition vs. transversion mutations) in FL vs. GC samples from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 missions. In both FL and GC samples, A:G and C:T transitions predominated in both missions, and at relatively similar frequencies (Figure 4). In addition, GC samples exhibited A:T, C:A, and G:T transversions that were not found in FL samples; conversely, FL samples exhibited T:A transversions that were not found in GC samples (Figure 4). Thus, the spectrum of mutational classes (transitions vs. transversions) was also altered in FL vs. GC samples in both the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 missions. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Frequency of transition and transversion mutations in FL (cyan and blue bars) and GC (light green and dark green bars) samples of B. subtilis rpoB in the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 missions. Mapping RifR Mutations on the Structure of RpoB Three-dimensional structures of RpoB elucidated from a number of bacteria (reviewed recently in Murakami, 2015) and supported by the crystal structure of RpoB in complex with Rif (Campbell et al., 2001), have revealed a great deal of structural conservation in the Rif-binding pocket. Rif binds in the concave surface of a roughly bowl-shaped depression in the RNA exit channel of RpoB, held in place both by direct H-bonding contacts and hydrophobic and ionic interactions with amino acids lining the pocket (Figure 5). Amino acids Q469, F470, D472, H482, R485, and S487 make direct H-bonds with Rif (Campbell et al., 2001), and are most frequently associated with RifR (Severinov et al., 1993; Campbell et al., 2001); indeed we observed that mutations at these positions led to RifR in FL and GC samples. Amino acids in the N-cluster do approach the Rif-binding pocket, but not within the 6 Å distance depicted in Figure 5. It is thought that substitution of amino acids containing relatively small side groups (V135, Q137) with bulkier side groups (F135, R137) can exert longer-range effects by distorting the binding pocket out of its optimum shape (Severinov et al., 1994).

(Campbell et al., 2001), using B. subtilis amino acid coordinates.

    "discussion": "Discussion In this communication we describe the results of two spaceflight experiments using B. subtilis in which growth, the frequency of mutation to RifR, and the corresponding spectrum of mutations within the RifR regions of the rpoB gene, were measured. Growth in FL vs GC Samples A number of experiments have been conducted in which various bacterial species have been cultivated under otherwise-matching conditions of hardware, media, inoculation, etc., and their growth, as measured by final cell density, has been compared in spaceflight vs. ground control samples. Some of these prior studies have shown increased final cell density during spaceflight, while others have found either no significant differences between spaceflight and 1 × g conditions (reviewed in Benoit and Klaus, 2007; Horneck et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2013; Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Coil et al., 2016), or even decreased growth in spaceflight (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). In both the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments described here, we measured no statistically significant difference in the final viable counts of Bacillus subtilis cells in FL vs. GC samples. As in most previous spaceflight experiments, the design of BRIC canisters does not allow growth measurements to be taken during the experiment, thus it was not possible to determine growth rates. However, the growth rate of B. subtilis cells in spaceflight vs. matched ground control samples was directly measured in the SESLO (Space Environment Survivability of Living Organisms) payload of the O/OREOS nanosatellite, and in that experiment cells were observed to grow at a slower rate in spaceflight (Nicholson et al., 2011). Mutation Frequencies in FL vs. GC Samples Although the human spaceflight environment in Low Earth Orbit is characterized by an increased flux of high-energy particles, and enhanced space radiation effects have been documented in astronauts and higher organisms (reviewed in De Micco et al., 2011; Maalouf et al., 2011), very few studies to date have tested the notion that exposure to the human spaceflight environment could lead to increased mutagenesis in microbes. In two prior studies, the mutation frequency was either found not to be different in FL vs. GC (Yatagai et al., 2000) or to be elevated ∼24-fold in FL samples (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). The results described here, from 2 separate spaceflight missions to the ISS (BRIC-18 and BRIC-21), showed that the frequency of mutation to RifR in B. subtilis was not significantly different in FL vs GC samples. Spectrum of rpoB Mutations in FL vs. GC The BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments reported here showed that the spectrum of mutations in B. subtilis rpoB leading to RifR was substantially different in FL vs. GC samples. Especially noteworthy were the mutations at Q137R and L489S which were identified only in FL samples; these alleles have never before been observed in B. subtilis rpoB. The results are in accord with the notion that the set of stresses defining an environment can elicit specific spectra of mutations. The observations from spaceflight reported here bolster the findings from prior ground-based experiments which showed that growth of B. subtilis under sporulating vs. non-sporulating conditions (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002) or aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions (Nicholson and Park, 2015), resulted in distinct spectra of mutations to RifR. This phenomenon is not peculiar to B. subtilis; it has also been reported in Staphylococcus aureus (Didier et al., 2011), Escherichia coli (Lindsey et al., 2013; Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida (Jatsenko et al., 2010), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Jenkins et al., 2009) (reviewed in refs. Koch et al., 2014; Alifano et al., 2015). It is significant to note that several of the above bacteria have also been found in human spaceflight habitats (Venkateswaran et al., 2014; Checinska et al., 2015). Broader Implications Because RNA polymerase is a single enzyme responsible for transcribing all genes in a bacterium, mutations in its subunits can have far-reaching consequences for global regulation of the microbial transcriptome. In particular, mutations in rpoB have been shown to cause Rif-independent physiological effects in a wide range of bacterial species (reviewed in ref. Koch et al., 2014). Such effects include: activation of cryptic metabolic capabilities (Perkins and Nicholson, 2008); alterations in the susceptibility to other classes of antibiotics (Kane et al., 1979; Kristich and Little, 2012); or production of various secondary metabolites (Hu et al., 2002). Furthermore, it has been shown that certain mutant alleles of rpoB actually enhance the fitness of the resulting RifR mutants under specific environmental stresses, such as growth under nutrient-limiting conditions (Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017a). These physiologic effects could have profound consequences for long-duration missions in space, as microbes will continue to evolve in human space habitats. We are currently pursuing the idea that mutations induced by the stress of spaceflight may provide enhanced evolutionary fitness in the spaceflight environment itself. Understanding microbial evolution in space is crucial to better cope with wide-ranging challenges, from biofilm formation to biocorrosion of materials to alterations in the human microbiome.",

Copyright notice ID: 5817088 PMID: 29491852 Abstract The effect of Bacillus subtilis exposure to the human spaceflight environment on growth, mutagenic frequency, and spectrum of mutations to rifampicin resistance (RifR) was investigated. B. subtilis cells were cultivated in Biological Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) on two separate missions to the International Space Station (ISS), dubbed BRIC-18 and BRIC-21, with matching asynchronous ground controls. No statistically significant difference in either growth or in the frequency of mutation to RifR was found in either experiment. However, nucleotide sequencing of the RifR regions of the rpoB gene from RifR mutants revealed dramatic differences in the spectrum of mutations between flight (FL) and ground control (GC) samples, including two newly discovered rpoB alleles in the FL samples (Q137R and L489S). The results strengthen the idea that exposure to the human spaceflight environment causes unique stresses on bacteria, leading to alterations in their mutagenic potential. Keywords: antibiotic resistance, mutation, rpoB, rifampicin, Bacillus subtilis, spaceflightIntroduction In contrast to the classical view that mutations are random, a growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stresses in microbes can alter both the mutation rate and the mutagenic spectrum, supplying an increased variety of mutational outputs for selection to operate on and hence shaping the evolutionary trajectory of organisms (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002; Foster, 2007; Nicholson and Park, 2015; Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b). This phenomenon, dubbed Stress-Induced Mutagenesis (SIM), has been most eloquently demonstrated in the recent work of Maharjan and Ferenci (b). E. coli cells were grown in chemostats under 5 different stresses, (limitation for carbon, phosphate, nitrogen, oxygen, or iron) or in a nutrient-rich environment, and loss-of-function mutations in the cycA gene leading to cycloserine resistance (CycR) were quantified, isolated, and subjected to fitness measurements (Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b). Although only 2 out of 5 stresses led to a significant increase in the mutation rate to CycR, all stresses resulted in distinct spectra of mutations in cycA conferring a variety of alterations in fitness of the resulting mutants (Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b). The human spaceflight environment presents its own unique set of physical stressors, including cosmic radiation, microgravity, vibration, electromagnetic fields, and altered atmospheric compositions. Numerous studies have explored how microorganisms respond physiologically to spaceflight exposure (reviewed extensively in Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015). However, very few studies have asked whether microbial exposure to spaceflight might lead to SIM (Yatagai et al., 2000; Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). Such studies are relevant to astronaut health risk assessment, given the role that microbial SIM may play in the emergence of antibiotic resistance or modifications to the astronaut microbiome. Long-duration human missions through interplanetary space to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars are currently being planned (NASA, 2015), and both the National Research Council (NRC) and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) have assigned a high priority to studies aimed at better understanding astronaut health risks during space exploration. NASA has implemented a three-phase approach to its long-term goal of the human exploration of Mars1. The first phase, to be accomplished in the present-to-mid-2020’s time frame, is dubbed the “Earth Reliant” phase, focusing on research aboard the International Space Station (ISS), currently the only microgravity platform for the long-term testing of crew health systems and technologies needed to decrease reliance on Earth. To date, only two studies have been performed exploring the notion that exposure of microbes to the stresses of the human spaceflight environment might result in SIM. First, B. subtilis spores containing a plasmid encoding the Escherichia coli rpsL gene were exposed to spaceflight in space station Mir vs. matched ground controls (Yatagai et al., 2000). The frequency of mutations in rpsL leading to spectinomycin resistance (SpcR) was found not to be significantly different between spaceflight and ground control samples, but sequencing of the mutant rpsL genes from 25 spaceflight and 38 ground control samples showed distinct differences in the spectrum of mutations leading to SpcR (Yatagai et al., 2000). Second, the frequency and spectrum of chromosomal mutations to rifampicin resistance (RifR) was measured in Staphylococcus epidermidis cells flown aboard the ISS and compared to matched ground controls (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). In this experiment the frequency of mutation to RifR was observed to be significantly (24-fold) greater in the spaceflight samples. Sequencing of the rpoB gene from 67 spaceflight and 57 ground control RifR mutants also showed that the spectrum of mutations to RifR was clearly different in the flight vs. the ground control samples (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). From our previous results (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016), we concluded that RifR was a good model to investigate SIM in spaceflight for a broad variety of microorganisms. Resistance to rifampicin derives from mutations within a small region of the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNA polymerase (Wehrli et al., 1968; Jin and Gross, 1988). This region corresponds to the Rif binding site of β (Campbell et al., 2001) and is highly conserved among prokaryotes (Severinov et al., 1993). Single-nucleotide substitutions in rpoB leading to RifR have been shown to alter the global patterns of transcription, and resulting phenotypes, in several bacteria including Neisseria meningitidis, Streptomyces lividans, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus (Hu et al., 2002; Maughan et al., 2004; Perkins and Nicholson, 2008; de Knegt et al., 2013; Colicchio et al., 2015; Villanueva et al., 2016). It is thus possible that mutation to RifR could alter the response of microbes to the spaceflight environment. For the present study we chose to use as the test organism the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis, which possesses several advantages as a model organism: (i) it is easily cultivated and amenable to genetic manipulation; (ii) it forms dormant spores, making it an easy system to prepare for spaceflight; (iii) it is the best-studied Gram-positive bacterium; and (iv) development of its genetics, genomics, and molecular biology is highly advanced. Thus, using the well-developed B. subtilis system will facilitate the investigation in further detail of any potential novel mutations isolated in rpoB.Materials and Methods Bacterial Strain, Media, and Growth Conditions The strain used was Bacillus subtilis strain 168 (trpC2) from the authors’ laboratory collection. Medium used throughout was trypticase soy yeast extract (TSY) medium consisting of (g/L): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5; yeast extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; final pH 7. For semisolid plates, agar was added to TSY at 15.0 g/L. For FL and GC experiments, glycerol was added to TSY liquid medium to 10% (v/v) final concentration, resulting in TSYG medium. As appropriate, the antibiotic rifampicin (Rif; Sigma–Aldrich) was added to TSY at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL. B. subtilis spores were routinely prepared by cultivation in liquid Schaeffer Sporulation Medium (Schaeffer et al., 1965) at 37°C with vigorous aeration. The culture was harvested when phase-contrast microscopic examination revealed that it consisted of >90% free spores, usually after 3–4 days of incubation.Sample Preparation Spores were purified by lysozyme treatment, buffer washing, and heat shock (80°C, 10 min) as described previously (Nicholson and Setlow, 1990). Spores were determined by phase-contrast microscopy to be >99% free of cell debris and unsporulated cells, and were stored at 4°C in deionized water. The working suspension of spores contained 108 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL. Aliquots of 0.1 mL (∼107 CFU) of the suspension were applied to the bottoms of sterile 60-mm diameter Petri dishes (Falcon Cat. No. 1007) and air-dried for 48–72 h at room temperature prior to use.BRIC Spaceflight Hardware The experiments described here utilized Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) spaceflight hardware, which has been described in detail previously (Paul et al., 2012). BRIC canisters can accomodate up to six samples. In these experiments, each BRIC was loaded with 5 Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs). Each PDFU was loaded with a 60-mm Petri dish containing air-dried spores, and sterile TSYG medium was loaded into a separate reservoir. To prevent contamination, all reagents and equipment used were sterilized prior to use and PDFUs were assembled using aseptic technique within a Class 2 Biological Safety Hood. In the sixth sample chamber of each BRIC was placed a HOBO R temperature data logger (Onset Computer Co., Bourne, MA, United States). Post-flight asynchronous GC experiments were conducted using the same hardware and configuration as in the flight experiment.Flight (FL) and Ground Control (GC) Timelines Bacillus subtilis samples were flown on two separate experiments to the ISS, the 18th and 21st BRIC missions to space, designated BRIC-18 and BRIC-21. FL samples were launched on the 3rd and 6th SpaceX Cargo Resupply missions to the ISS (SpaceX-3 and SpaceX-6 CRS, respectively), using the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule configuration. Pertinent information regarding the activity timelines of these two missions can be found in Table 1. Growth of samples was initiated in-flight and samples incubated for 122 h (BRIC-18) or 25 h (BRIC-21) before transfer to the onboard -80°C freezer. Frozen samples were returned to Earth in the Dragon capsule and were maintained in the frozen state until return to KSC for de-integration and further processing. Table 1.

Samples were incubated in the KSC ISS Environmental Simulation Chamber following the temperature regimes recorded during the flights (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016; Morrison et al., 2017) and growth was terminated by transfer to a -80°C freezer, where samples were stored until further processing.Post-experiment Sample Processing In the BRIC-18 experiment, both FL and GC BRIC canisters were transferred from storage at -80°C to a +4°C refrigerator and samples allowed to thaw completely overnight. Liquid samples in Petri dishes were recovered from the PDFUs, transported to the laboratory on ice and further processed immediately. In the BRIC-21 experiment, both FL and GC samples were recovered from BRIC canisters in the frozen state, transported on dry ice to the laboratory, and stored at -80°C for later processing. Frozen samples were then thawed on ice, resuspended and processed immediately. In all instances, cells were detached from interior plate surfaces and resuspended using sterile disposable rubber spatulas. Resuspended cultures were transferred to sterile 15-mL conical centrifuge tubes, and the total recovered volume was measured. For viable counts, aliquots from cultures were diluted serially tenfold in TSY medium, dilutions plated on TSY plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h to obtain CFU/mL. To obtain the total CFU per PDFU, the CFU/mL were multiplied by the volume of liquid recovered. To select for RifR mutants, the remainder of each culture was concentrated by centrifugation, plated without dilution onto TSY + Rif plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24–48 h. The frequency of mutation to RifR was calculated by dividing the total number of RifR mutants by the total number of viable cells from each sample. Individual RifR mutants were streak-purified on TSY + Rif plates and stored at -70°C in TSY + 25% glycerol, then processed for DNA sequencing.DNA Sequencing and Analyses Primers used for PCR amplification of two RifR regions of the B. subtilis rpoB gene are listed in Table 2. The corresponding rpoB regions were amplified directly from cells using 3 μL of culture from their respective glycerol stocks as DNA template, using the GoTaq® PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) and the following thermal cycling conditions: 95°C, 2 min for the initial denaturation step, then 36 cycles of (95°C, 30 s; 55°C, 1 min; 72°C, 2 min), followed by a final elongation step (72°C, 5 min). PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (BRIC-18) or at GeneWiz LLC (South Plainfield, NJ, United States) (BRIC-21). Multiple rpoB sequences were aligned using the online Clustal Omega server2 (Li et al., 2015) to identify the position of mutations relative to the wild-type rpoB sequence obtained from B. subtilis laboratory strain 168. In order to confirm the identity of novel (i.e., never-before-isolated) rpoB mutations, the corresponding region of the newly sequenced rpoB allele was amplified by PCR from each mutant and the resulting amplicon was introduced by transformation into competent cells of RifS B. subtilis strain WN547 using standard procedures as described previously (Boylan et al., 1972; Nicholson and Maughan, 2002). From selected RifR transformants, the corresponding region of rpoB was again PCR amplified and sequenced to confirm that the mutation had been transferred. Table 2.

A detailed presentation of the temperature data can be found elsewhere (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016; Morrison et al., 2017). Table 3.

Because the data was determined not to be normally distributed, it was analyzed using non-parametric statistics. In the BRIC-18 experiment, cells grew to average total CFU per PDFU of 3.98 × 106 (FL) and 1.10 × 107 (GC); these values were determined not to be significantly different (Figure 1). Ground-based growth kinetic experiments revealed that the rather low cell yield in the BRIC-18 mission was due to the prolonged incubation time (122 h) (data not shown). For the BRIC-21 mission, an increased cell yield was needed to provide sufficient sample mass for additional antibiotic susceptibility testing (Morrison et al., 2017) and RNA-seq analysis (to be published elsewhere). In ground experiments preparatory for the BRIC-21 mission, it was determined that an incubation time of 25 h resulted in higher cell yields, and that 25-h cultures were in the late-logarithmic to early stationary phase (data not shown). Accordingly, statistical comparison of the total CFU obtained between the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 flights uncovered that cells grew to significantly higher titers in the BRIC-21 experiment, to an average total CFU per PDFU of 1.72 × 108 (FL) and 2.13 × 108 (GC) (P < 0.005). As found in the BRIC-18 mission, FL vs. GC titers within the BRIC-21 mission were determined to be not significantly different (Figure 1). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Box plots depicting growth (presented as log10 Total CFU) of B. subtilis FL (cyan and blue boxes) and GC (light and dark green boxes) samples during the BRIC-18 (left panel; n = 5) and BRIC-21 (right panel; n = 7) experiments. nsd, not significantly different (Kruskal–Wallis, P > 0.05).Mutation Frequencies to RifR in FL vs. GC Samples The mutation frequency to RifR was determined for both FL and GC samples recovered from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments (Figure 2). Because the data were determined not to be normally distributed, they were analyzed using non-parametric statistics. In the BRIC-18 experiment, cells exhibited an average mutation frequency of 6.9 × 10-6 (FL) and 7.54 × 10-6 (GC); these values were determined to be not significantly different (Figure 2). In the BRIC-21 experiment, cells exhibited an average mutation frequency of 6.11 × 10-8 (FL) and 1.94 × 10-8 (GC); again, these values were determined to be not significantly different (Figure 2). However, statistical comparison of the mutation frequencies to RifR obtained between the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 flights revealed that cells demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of mutation to RifR in the BRIC-18 experiment (P < 0.007). Again, this may result from differences in the incubation times to which the cells were subjected–122 h in BRIC-18 vs. 25 h in BRIC-21–due to the well-documented phenomenon of stationary phase mutagenesis in B. subtilis (Robleto et al., 2007).

Nucleotide sequences were determined from a total of 56 FL and 15 GC samples from BRIC-18 (Table 4) and from a total of 72 FL and 38 GC samples from BRIC-21 (Table 5). Both sets of data are summarized graphically in Figure 3. Examination of the data revealed several striking differences in the mutational spectrum within rpoB between the FL and GC samples. Table 4.

(Bottom) Expanded graphic summary of the distribution of RifR mutations. Shown are the N-cluster and Cluster I of the B. subtilis rpoB gene. The center row depicts the RpoB amino acid sequence, flanked above and below by the wild-type rpoB nucleotide sequence. Mutations identified in FL and GC samples are denoted above and below the central line, respectively. Each box represents an independently sequenced mutation, and the corresponding amino acid alteration is indicated. Data from both the BRIC-18 (cyan and light green boxes) and BRIC-21 (blue and dark green boxes) are presented.N-Cluster Historically, the only mutation conferring RifR previously identified in the N-cluster of B. subtilis rpoB was a G-to-T transversion causing the amino acid change V135F; this mutation was previously found at approximately equal frequencies in spores exposed either to Earth or simulated Mars conditions (Perkins et al., 2008). In the present experiments, the V135F mutation was observed only in BRIC-21 GC samples (Figure 3 and Table 5). However, a novel mutation, Q137R, was detected in the N-cluster in 4 out of 56 BRIC-18 FL samples, but in none of the GC samples (Figure 3 and Table 4). This novel mutation was confirmed by retransformation and resequencing as described in Materials and Methods. The Q137R mutation was found in two separate FL PDFUs, suggesting that the spaceflight environment may be conducive to its formation (Tables 4, 6). Table 6.

Each class of mutation was scored as either present (X) or absent (blank) in the corresponding PDFU. Totals are tabulated in the rightmost two columns.Cluster I The majority of RifR mutations in both FL and GC samples were found to occur in Cluster I, in agreement with numerous prior studies. Historically, the most common amino acid changes in Cluster I leading to RifR occur at amino acids Q469, H482, and S487 (Severinov et al., 1993; Campbell et al., 2001; Nicholson and Maughan, 2002; Perkins et al., 2008). In our experiments, the spectrum and frequency of mutations appeared to be similar at these three amino acids (Figure 3), with the exception that a single never before isolated mutation (H482N) was identified among the GC samples from BRIC-18 (Figure 3 and Table 4). However, in FL samples from the BRIC-21 experiment we found a large number of mutations (32/72) at L489, consisting exclusively of T-to-C transitions resulting in the amino acid change L489S (Figure 3 and Table 5). This novel mutation was confirmed by retransformation and resequencing as described in Section “Materials and Methods.” The L489S mutation was found in two separate FL PDFUs, also suggesting that the spaceflight environment may be conducive to its formation (Tables 5, 6). In addition to amino acids Q469, H482, S487, and L489 we found within Cluster I two differences in the spectrum of mutations in rpoB. First, at amino acid D472, we observed no mutations in FL samples, but in BRIC-18 GC samples we observed two different mutations; a G-to-T transversion at the first position and an A-to-T transversion at the second position of codon D472, leading to the deduced amino acid changes D472Y and D472V, respectively (Figure 3). Second, no mutations were found in GC samples at amino acid A478, but in the BRIC-18 FL samples 8/59 of the total mutations consisted of a C-to-T transition at the second codon position resulting an A478V substitution (Figure 3 and Table 4).RifR Mutations Not Mapping to Known rpoB Regions Historically, 4 regions in rpoB have been associated with RifR in the model organism E. coli, designated as the N-cluster and Clusters I, II, and III (Figure 3) (reviewed in Severinov et al., 1993, 1994). These clusters have been defined by the locations of RifR mutations as codons 127-135 (N-cluster), 463-489 (Cluster I), and 519-532 (Cluster II) (B. subtilis coordinates). To date, in B. subtilis RifR mutations have never been identified in Cluster III or in intervening regions. However in 2 PDFUs from the BRIC-18 mission were isolated RifR mutants for which no mutation in rpoB was found by sequencing the classic N-cluster or Clusters I, II, and III (Table 4). This phenomenon has been reported before (Ahmad et al., 2012) and raises 2 formal possibilities. First, these mutations conferring RifR might reside in rpoB but outside the Clusters N, I, II, or III (it should be noted that our primer sets covered only ∼38% of the complete rpoB sequence; Figure 3). Second, the mutations may be located outside rpoB entirely; low-level RifR has been previously reported in mutants with altered permeability or efflux (Goldstein, 2014). In any event, because these mutants appeared in FL PDFUs, they may represent new allele(s) and warrant further investigation.Distribution of RifR rpoB Mutations by PDFU Examination of Tables 4, 5 indicated that in some PDFUs an unusually high number of repeats of the same RifR mutant were found. For example, 16 out of 16 RifR mutants sequenced from BRIC-18 FL PDFU-5 (Table 4), and 12 out of 13 mutants sequenced from BRIC-21 GC PDFU-3 (Table 5), were Q469R. These data suggested that some of the populations in both FL and GC samples contained “jackpots,” i.e., cultures in which the progeny of early arising RifR mutants became over-represented in the final culture (Foster, 2006). We therefore analyzed the data by counting each type of mutation as either “present” (at least once) or “absent” in each PDFU, the results of which are presented in Table 6. When re-examined in this way, differences in the distribution of RifR mutants in FL vs. GC samples were still apparent. For example, the Q137R and L489S mutations were each found in 2 separate FL PDFUs, but in zero GC PDFUs (Table 6). In contrast, mutations leading to Q469R predominated in both FL (6/6) and GC (5/6) PDFUs, suggesting that occurrence of this specific mutation is not responsive to spaceflight exposure (Table 6).Transitions vs. Transversion in FL and GC Samples As reported above, differences were observed in the location of rpoB mutations in FL vs. GC samples in B. subtilis RifR mutants. These observations prompted us to examine the nature of nucleotide changes (i.e., transition vs. transversion mutations) in FL vs. GC samples from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 missions. In both FL and GC samples, A:G and C:T transitions predominated in both missions, and at relatively similar frequencies (Figure 4). In addition, GC samples exhibited A:T, C:A, and G:T transversions that were not found in FL samples; conversely, FL samples exhibited T:A transversions that were not found in GC samples (Figure 4). Thus, the spectrum of mutational classes (transitions vs. transversions) was also altered in FL vs. GC samples in both the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 missions. FIGURE 4.

Rif binds in the concave surface of a roughly bowl-shaped depression in the RNA exit channel of RpoB, held in place both by direct H-bonding contacts and hydrophobic and ionic interactions with amino acids lining the pocket (Figure 5). Amino acids Q469, F470, D472, H482, R485, and S487 make direct H-bonds with Rif (Campbell et al., 2001), and are most frequently associated with RifR (Severinov et al., 1993; Campbell et al., 2001); indeed we observed that mutations at these positions led to RifR in FL and GC samples. Amino acids in the N-cluster do approach the Rif-binding pocket, but not within the 6 Å distance depicted in Figure 5. It is thought that substitution of amino acids containing relatively small side groups (V135, Q137) with bulkier side groups (F135, R137) can exert longer-range effects by distorting the binding pocket out of its optimum shape (Severinov et al., 1994).

Growth in FL vs GC Samples A number of experiments have been conducted in which various bacterial species have been cultivated under otherwise-matching conditions of hardware, media, inoculation, etc., and their growth, as measured by final cell density, has been compared in spaceflight vs. ground control samples. Some of these prior studies have shown increased final cell density during spaceflight, while others have found either no significant differences between spaceflight and 1 × g conditions (reviewed in Benoit and Klaus, 2007; Horneck et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2013; Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Coil et al., 2016), or even decreased growth in spaceflight (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). In both the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments described here, we measured no statistically significant difference in the final viable counts of Bacillus subtilis cells in FL vs. GC samples. As in most previous spaceflight experiments, the design of BRIC canisters does not allow growth measurements to be taken during the experiment, thus it was not possible to determine growth rates. However, the growth rate of B. subtilis cells in spaceflight vs. matched ground control samples was directly measured in the SESLO (Space Environment Survivability of Living Organisms) payload of the O/OREOS nanosatellite, and in that experiment cells were observed to grow at a slower rate in spaceflight (Nicholson et al., 2011).Mutation Frequencies in FL vs. GC Samples Although the human spaceflight environment in Low Earth Orbit is characterized by an increased flux of high-energy particles, and enhanced space radiation effects have been documented in astronauts and higher organisms (reviewed in De Micco et al., 2011; Maalouf et al., 2011), very few studies to date have tested the notion that exposure to the human spaceflight environment could lead to increased mutagenesis in microbes. In two prior studies, the mutation frequency was either found not to be different in FL vs. GC (Yatagai et al., 2000) or to be elevated ∼24-fold in FL samples (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). The results described here, from 2 separate spaceflight missions to the ISS (BRIC-18 and BRIC-21), showed that the frequency of mutation to RifR in B. subtilis was not significantly different in FL vs GC samples.Spectrum of rpoB Mutations in FL vs. GC The BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments reported here showed that the spectrum of mutations in B. subtilis rpoB leading to RifR was substantially different in FL vs. GC samples. Especially noteworthy were the mutations at Q137R and L489S which were identified only in FL samples; these alleles have never before been observed in B. subtilis rpoB. The results are in accord with the notion that the set of stresses defining an environment can elicit specific spectra of mutations. The observations from spaceflight reported here bolster the findings from prior ground-based experiments which showed that growth of B. subtilis under sporulating vs. non-sporulating conditions (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002) or aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions (Nicholson and Park, 2015), resulted in distinct spectra of mutations to RifR. This phenomenon is not peculiar to B. subtilis; it has also been reported in Staphylococcus aureus (Didier et al., 2011), Escherichia coli (Lindsey et al., 2013; Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida (Jatsenko et al., 2010), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Jenkins et al., 2009) (reviewed in refs. Koch et al., 2014; Alifano et al., 2015). It is significant to note that several of the above bacteria have also been found in human spaceflight habitats (Venkateswaran et al., 2014; Checinska et al., 2015).Broader Implications Because RNA polymerase is a single enzyme responsible for transcribing all genes in a bacterium, mutations in its subunits can have far-reaching consequences for global regulation of the microbial transcriptome. In particular, mutations in rpoB have been shown to cause Rif-independent physiological effects in a wide range of bacterial species (reviewed in ref. Koch et al., 2014). Such effects include: activation of cryptic metabolic capabilities (Perkins and Nicholson, 2008); alterations in the susceptibility to other classes of antibiotics (Kane et al., 1979; Kristich and Little, 2012); or production of various secondary metabolites (Hu et al., 2002). Furthermore, it has been shown that certain mutant alleles of rpoB actually enhance the fitness of the resulting RifR mutants under specific environmental stresses, such as growth under nutrient-limiting conditions (Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017a). These physiologic effects could have profound consequences for long-duration missions in space, as microbes will continue to evolve in human space habitats. We are currently pursuing the idea that mutations induced by the stress of spaceflight may provide enhanced evolutionary fitness in the spaceflight environment itself. Understanding microbial evolution in space is crucial to better cope with wide-ranging challenges, from biofilm formation to biocorrosion of materials to alterations in the human microbiome.Author Contributions PF-C contributed in design of the investigation, execution of the experiments, and writing of the manuscript.

Introduction On 17 December 1946, the first documented experiment to study the response of a living organism to spaceflight was performed, with the launch and recovery of fungal spores on a V-2 rocket from White Sands, New Mexico [1]. Since that time, considerable theoretical and experimental effort has been devoted to understanding how living organisms sense, respond, and adapt to long-term spaceflight, particularly regarding their exposure to chronic microgravity. Extensive investigations conducted in space have resulted in a relative wealth of understanding of microgravity effects at the mechanistic level in eukaryotic organisms including humans [2], animals [3], plants [4], and protists [5]. In contrast to the situation in eukaryotes, it has proven more difficult to elucidate at the mechanistic level how single-celled prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) sense and respond to reduced gravity [6,7,8]. In this hypothesis paper, we briefly review the state of our understanding of how eukaryotic cells sense, respond, and adapt to spaceflight microgravity, via various pathways responsive to the unloading of mechanical stress. We observe that prokaryotic cells possess many structures analogous to mechanosensitive structures in eukaryotes. We review and update the evidence indicating that prokaryotes possess and actively utilize mechanosensing and mechanotransduction mechanisms, and we expand upon existing models to include the role of the bacterial nucleoid in converting external mechanical information into the modulation of gene expression. This hypothesis builds upon, updates, and expands previous work in the field, to which the reader is referred for background information [9,10].2. Mechanosensing in Eukaryotes Terrestrial life on Earth has evolved in the continuous presence of gravity [10], and eukaryotic organisms have developed systems to sense their orientation in the gravity field and to respond appropriately. A large body of evidence has accumulated supporting the idea that mechanics play a key role in regulating various eukaryotic cell functions such as cell division, differentiation, immunity, development, and motility. Many of these diverse cellular functions are mediated through pathways of mechanosensing and mechanotransduction, the molecular details of which are currently being elucidated [11,12,13,14]. A generalized and simplified schematic diagram of the steps involved in eukaryotic mechanotransduction is presented in Figure 1 and described below. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Schematic model of eukaryotic mechanotransduction pathway. An external mechanical force generated through the extracellular matrix (ECM) or tight junctions is sensed by mechanosensitive proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) and transduced through the cytoskeleton, LINC protein complexes in the nuclear membrane (NM), and nucleoskeleton to effect transcription of mechanosensitive genes. Colored shapes represent proteins in the transduction pathway; their specific identities and functions are elaborated in refs. [15,16,17]. See text for details.In the simplified model depicted in Figure 1, external force can consist of any number of mechanical phenomena, such as shear, stretch, compression, or sedimentation of otoliths or statoliths. Physical forces can also be exerted on a cell through interaction with the extracellular matrix, or with other cells connected via tight junctions. In addition, while not strictly an “external” force, because the nucleus itself is suspended in the cytoskeletal matrix, and its density differs from the surrounding cytoplasm, the nucleus itself exerts mechanical stress on the cell. The simplified model above depicts an idealized mechanoreceptor as a protein complex embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane that senses external physical forces (Figure 1). The actual situation is almost certainly more complex, and likely differs considerably depending on the type of receptor, cell, tissue, or organism studied. On the simpler end of the spectrum are single transmembrane mechanosensitive ion channels that respond to membrane deformation [18]. On a more complex level, the surfaces of many eukaryotic cells exhibit focal adhesion (FA) structures which physically link the extracellular matrix to the internal cytoskeleton through complexes of signaling proteins, among them mechanosensitive transmembrane proteins. Such structures establish both physical and functional connections between the cell and its external environment (reviewed in [19,20]). As DNA is separated from the cytoplasmic compartment and contained within a membrane-bound nucleus (Figure 1), how do mechanical signals reach the DNA to modulate gene expression? In addition to the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, the nucleus itself contains a skeleton (the nucleoskeleton) composed of actin and lamin filaments. Furthermore, the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton are physically connected through Linker of Nucleus and Cytoskeleton (LINC) protein complexes [16] (Figure 1). Evidence is accumulating that LINC complexes allow for the rapid mechanotransduction of signals from the cytoplasmic membrane and cytoskeleton directly through the nuclear membrane to the nucleoskeleton, enabling rapid gene expression responses (reviewed in [17]). It is thought that the LINC complex is intimately involved in modulation of genome expression in response to mechanical stimuli through chromatin remodeling and recruitment of DNA and RNA polymerases, ligases, acetylases, methylases, and cyclin-dependent kinases, resulting in changes in gene expression at the transcriptional, translational, post-translational, and epigenetic levels [19,20]. The details of the myriad of eukaryotic mechanotransduction systems, though not yet completely elucidated, are currently being actively investigated [17]. In the freefall environment of spaceflight, gravitational loading is negated. Numerous studies using various cell types have shown that eukaryotic cells exhibit a morphological sensitivity to microgravity, exposure to which can cause alterations in cell shape, size, volume, and adherence properties [10,19,20]. These signals are converted into alterations in chromosomal architecture, which in turn regulate the transcriptional apparatus [21]. In spaceflight research, this general “mechanotransduction” model successfully explains the pathways for sensing and response to microgravity by plant and mammalian whole organisms, as well as single eukaryotic cells [5,22,23]. It is unclear whether such responses to microgravity are direct or indirect (resulting from, say, downstream effects of microgravity on chemical gradients or fluid shear). However, results from parabolic aircraft and sounding rocket flights demonstrated that the transcriptomes of human monocytes responded immediately—within seconds—after exposure to microgravity or hypergravity (1.8 × g) [24] suggesting that, in this case at least, gravity or its absence is exerting a direct effect on gene expression.3. Does a Microbial Analog of Eukaryotic Mechanotransduction Exist? In contrast to our relatively detailed understanding of the eukaryotic microgravity response in terms of mechanosensing and mechanotransduction mechanisms, no such detailed model exists to explain how prokaryotes respond to gravity in general, much less to spaceflight microgravity. The origins of this situation can be traced back to an influential and often-cited theoretical study from 1965 asserting that microorganisms smaller than 10 micrometers should not be able to perceive gravitational forces [25]. Despite a lack of empirical evidence supporting this contention, it has nevertheless persisted in the spaceflight microgravity literature over the ensuing half century (for reviews, see [8,26]). Due to a lack of fluid convection in microgravity, spaceflight has been considered to be a quiescent environment characterized by low hydrodynamic shear and lack of convective transfer of mass and heat [26]. To emulate this low-shear environment on Earth, various rotating devices called clinostats have been developed and utilized as microgravity analog systems [27,28]. Early experiments cultivating microbes in clinostats indicated that certain phenotypes such as microcin B17 production by Escherichia coli [29] and virulence in Salmonella enterica [30] were altered in the clinostat environment. These and similar observations led to the notion of mechanotransduction as a possible mechanism for a microgravity response in prokaryotes, proposed in a 2004 review [9]. Numerous subsequent investigations have been conducted to characterize the response of various microorganisms to the low fluid shear environment using both spaceflight and clinorotation ([31,32,33,34,35]; reviewed extensively in [7,8,26]). These studies clearly established a role for hydrodynamic shear stress, or its absence, in influencing some aspects of gene expression and some phenotypes in some, but not all, bacteria tested [7,8]. Subsequent work mapping transcriptomic responses of S. enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to spaceflight and clinorotation identified the molecular chaperone and global regulator Hfq as being implicated in the low-shear response, although its mechanism of action is currently unknown [33,34,36]. Several studies have mapped global transcriptomic responses of bacteria to the low-shear environment, comparing cells grown in spaceflight and clinostat conditions with corresponding ground controls [33,34,36,37,38,39], but to date, these studies have failed to yield insights into a detailed underlying molecular mechanism [40,41]. 3.1. Microbial Internal Structure If we are to draw upon the eukaryotic mechanotransduction model of spaceflight signal transduction as depicted in Figure 1 and extend it to microbes, it is worthwhile first to review our current understanding of the internal structure of prokaryotes, paying particular attention to structures involved in mechanosensing and mechanotransduction. Our understanding of the interior architecture of living microbial cells has lagged behind that of eukaryotes, due to their small size at the limits of optical resolution and the lack of techniques for mechanical manipulation of such small cells [42,43]. Indeed, until relatively recently the interior of the prokaryotic cell was thought to be an unordered “bag of enzymes” with little or no intracellular compartmentalization [44]. Advances in molecular biology, microscopic imaging technologies, and the development of fluorescent molecular tags have changed this view radically within the past two decades; microbial cells are now known to exhibit a high level of subcellular organization rivaling that of eukaryotic cells [45,46,47]. As was mentioned in a previous review [9], microbes possess both functional and structural analogs of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton; indeed, cytoskeletal components from all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) are phylogenetically related, indicating their descent from a common ancestor early in evolution [48]. An updated comparison of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cytoskeletal analogs is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Comparison of cytoskeletal analogs 1. Eukaryotic Cytoskeletal Structure Eukaryotic Subunit Analogs Prokaryotic Subunit Analogs Function in Prokaryotes Microtubules α-Tubulin, β-Tubulin FtsZ Cytokinesis TubZ DNA positioning RepX Plasmid replication Microfilaments Actin Superfamily MreB Cell shape, chromosome segregation FtsA Cytokinesis ParM DNA segregation Intermediate Filaments Keratins, Vimentin, Desmin, Neurofilament Proteins, Lamins CreS (crescentin) Cell shape Open in a new tab 1 Adapted from [48].As can be seen in Table 1, numerous proteins belonging to both the actin and tubulin superfamilies of eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins have been identified in Bacteria and Archaea. In addition to the canonical actin/tubulin/intermediate filament superfamilies, prokaryotes contain a large number of filament-forming proteins that do not have eukaryotic homologs, such as ParA/B, MinC/D, and bactofilins [49]. Many of these protein filaments organize collaboratively through interactions between themselves and supramacromolecular structures such as the bacterial membrane, cell wall, and nucleoid [49]. In prokaryotic cells, internal filaments serve a variety of functions, including: organizing cell division; control of cell shape; organization and segregation of chromosomal, plasmid, and phage DNA; membrane remodeling; organization of cell wall synthesis; and scaffolding of spore structures in spore-forming Firmicutes [45,46,47,50]. In addition, in many cases cytoskeletal filaments have been directly visualized and characterized in prokaryotic cells using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy techniques [50,51].3.2. Mechanosensing in Prokaryotes Since the early days of microbiology in the 19th century, prokaryotes have been known to monitor and respond to their external chemical environment [52]. More recently, microbes have also been shown to respond to mechanical forces such as fluid flow, pressure, and contact with surfaces or other cells [9,45,46]. Similar to eukaryotic cells, bacteria possess mechanosensory proteins either displayed on the cell surface (e.g., adhesins) or extending into the extracellular environment (e.g., flagella, pili). Proteins residing in the cell envelope can sense and respond to deformations of the cell surface. The integral membrane proteins MscS and MscL sense membrane deformation resulting from osmotic stress and respond by opening or closing their pores to allow passage of osmotically active solutes (e.g., potassium, glutamate, or trehalose) in order to maintain osmotic balance and turgor pressure [53]. Adhesins present on the cell surface are able to sense forces such as shear, compression, or tension and transduce these signals to the cell interior, activating the production of second messenger molecules such as cAMP and cyclic di-GMP which in turn activate or repress transcription of target genes [45]. Protein filaments such as flagella and Type IV pili are anchored in the cell surface and extend into the extracellular environment. These structures have long been associated with motility (flagella) and adhesion (pili), but recently have also been implicated in the regulation of gene expression via mechanosensing and mechanotransduction mechanisms (reviewed in [46]). For example, motility of Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis cells through liquid media is due to the rotation of helical flagella driven by rotary motors embedded in the cell membrane. Contact of cells with a surface increases the torque applied onto flagella, inhibiting their rotation. This rotational inhibition increases strain on the flagellar motor embedded in the membrane, which generates a signal sensed by the two-component system histidine kinase DegS. DegS in turn phosphorylates the DegU response regulator, and phosphorylated DegU up-regulates the transcription of an entire class of genes involved in biofilm production [54,55]. Thus, an outside mechanical force can be sensed by a bacterial cell and transduced to the transcriptional apparatus to dramatically change its phenotype from a solitary free-swimming cell to a sessile member of a biofilm community. 3.3. Mechanotransduction in Prokaryotes In the above examples, perception of mechanical stress was shown to trigger classic chemical transducers, such as second messengers or two-component systems, to effect altered gene expression. Such mechanisms do not rely on mechanotransduction through a cytoskeleton. Indeed, at present cytoskeletal mechanotransduction in prokaryotes has been much less thoroughly investigated than its eukaryotic counterpart, although recent studies have begun to uncover the roles played by prokaryotic cytoskeletal protein homologs in the regulation of cell physiology. Some examples follow. 3.3.1. Cell Growth and Division The prokaryotic cell wall is a dynamic network of peptidoglycan (PG) making up the sacculus that maintains cell shape, resists lysis of the cell by turgor pressure, and which must accommodate cell growth in varying environments. Morphogenesis of the cell wall is ultimately governed by cytoskeletal proteins (reviewed recently in [56]). At least two distinct machineries exist to accomplish this feat, the elongasome and the divisome. Filaments of MreB, FtsZ, and FtsA proteins serve to organize and direct the growth and division machinery to their proper locations. The elongasome is responsible for the insertion of new PG into the growing sacculus and is organized by the actin homolog MreB (Table 1). MreB filaments move circumferentially around rod-shaped cells and organize the multiprotein PG synthetic machinery to add PG in a helical fashion along the cell cylinder, allowing cell length to increase [49]. The divisome is the molecular machine responsible for cell separation (cytokinesis) under the control of the tubulin homolog FtsZ and the actin homolog FtsA (Table 1). FtsZ filaments organize into a centrally located ring-shaped structure (the Z-ring) that directs the PG machinery to produce the division septum during cytokinesis [56]. Cytokinesis also involves the separation of the cell membrane. FtsA forms filaments that directly interact with FtsZ filaments and anchor the constricting Z-ring to the cytoplasmic membrane, ensuring that all layers of the cell envelope are constricted and separated during cytokinesis [49]. In addition, placement of the division septum at mid-cell and suppression of division at the cell poles is accomplished by filaments of DivIVA, MinC, and MinD which form a complex structure at the cell poles [49]. 3.3.2. DNA Division, Repair, and Gene Expression In prokaryotes, filament-forming proteins perform numerous functions on DNA including chromosome division, chromosome and plasmid segregation, DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression (reviewed in [49]). The actin homolog MreB is involved with the initial stages of bacterial chromosome segregation coupled with DNA synthesis [57]. With help of ParB, the ParA protein forms collaborative filaments with DNA and is involved with chromosome movement and segregation during cell division using a currently unknown mechanism [49]. The RecA protein is central both in DNA repair and homologous recombination; it binds and forms filaments with both single- and double-stranded DNA and has been shown to exert cytomotive properties in the movement of DNA during double-strand break repair [49]. H-NS proteins are a class of transcriptional repressors that nucleate at specific regulatory sequences and form stiff collaborative filaments that sterically hinder RNA polymerase from binding to promoters in the vicinity. It is estimated H-NS regulates the transcription of up to 5% of the genes in E. coli [49]. However, at present, the mechanism(s) of exactly how cytoskeletal filaments are involved in coordinating DNA synthesis and chromosomal division with membrane and cell wall synthesis and cytokinesis in prokaryotes is currently unknown and an active area of research.3.4. Prokaryotic Nucleoid Architecture The prokaryotic counterpart of the eukaryotic nucleus is the bacterial chromosome or nucleoid. The nucleoid consists of genomic DNA in a complex with its complement of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). The nucleoid is not bounded by its own membrane and is in direct contact with the cytoplasm. In the last two decades, using fluorescence microscopy to track chromosomal loci inside bacteria cells, researchers have found that bacterial chromosomes are organized into stereotypical patterns, with specific chromosomal regions localizing to defined cellular locations (reviewed in [58]). Over the past few years, the application of genome-wide high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) assays to bacteria has provided a detailed picture of the three-dimensional folding characteristics of the entire chromosome. In parallel, super-resolution microscopy techniques have strongly advanced our knowledge of bacterial nucleoid organization. It is increasingly appreciated that the nucleoid adopts a specific architecture, which alters dramatically in response to the growth phase, cellular development, and environmental changes. Recent Hi-C studies of a number of bacterial species provided insights into the three-dimensional folding of the bacterial chromosome. In Caulobacter crescentus and B. subtilis, but not E. coli, the chromosome exhibits long-range interactions. The two replication arms are juxtaposed from the origin to the terminus region, mediated by the SMC condensin complex [59,60,61,62,63]. For all three bacterial species, the genome along its entire length is organized into chromosome interaction domains (CIDs), ranging from ~30 to >400 kilobase pairs. Regions within each domain interact with each other more frequently than with regions in other domains. The domain boundaries are often enriched with highly transcribed genes, and inhibition of transcription essentially abolishes all domain boundaries [59,63], indicating that the 3D architecture of the nucleoid is intimately linked to transcription.3.5. DNA Supercoiling The nucleoid is a highly condensed structure that must allow the replication and transcription machinery to access specific genes in a coordinated fashion, in order to optimize cell metabolism and replication under a wide range of environmental conditions [64]. To accomplish this feat, selected parts of the nucleoid are constantly and dynamically de- and re-condensed in response to environmental signals. Dynamic restructuring of the nucleoid depends critically on a host of enzymes that control DNA topology, collectively known as topoisomerases, which maintain DNA in an optimal state of negative supercoiling. Transcription of a gene is dependent upon the local DNA superhelical state, and in turn, the transcription process itself influences DNA supercoiling, by overwinding DNA ahead of the transcription complex and underwinding it behind (reviewed in [65]). A growing body of evidence points to changes in DNA supercoiling as being a key mediator between environmental sensing by a microbe and its response through modulation of global transcription patterns. It has been shown experimentally that DNA supercoiling is sensitive to variations in the physical environment such as: pH, oxygen, temperature, osmotic pressure, oxidative stress, nutrition, and growth phase, among others (reviewed in [66]). In turn, it has also been shown experimentally that alterations in DNA supercoiling can influence the global pattern of bacterial gene transcription, and ultimately the phenotypic response to environmental changes (reviewed in [66]). Historically, most studies in this area have been performed using Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, S. enterica, Vibrio cholerae); however, these investigations have been recently extended to the Gram-positive opportunist Streptococcus pneumoniae [67]. Recent evidence suggests active transcription drives the formation of boundaries between CIDs [68], likely through alterations in DNA topology [65], thus highlighting the three-way interactions between nucleoid architecture, supercoiling, and transcription.3.6. Epigenetic Modification of DNA Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in DNA sequence (reviewed in [69]). In bacteria, the most-studied epigenetic modification of DNA is base methylation. Specific DNA methyltransferases are responsible for the post-replicative addition of a methyl group to the N6-position of adenine (6mA), the C5-position of cytosine (5mC), or the N4-position of cytosine (4mC) [70]. Base methylation can modulate the interaction of DNA-binding proteins with their cognate sites, and methylation of DNA controls genome defense, chromosome replication and segregation, nucleoid organization, cell cycle control, DNA repair, and regulation of transcription (reviewed in [71]). In particular, a number of specific systems have been described in which gene transcription is directly regulated by DNA methylation/demethylation/hemimethylation ([72,73,74,75,76,77]; reviewed in [71]). Furthermore, both nucleoid organization and chromosome replication are controlled by DNA methylation [78,79]. Therefore, the available evidence indicates that nucleoid architecture, DNA supercoiling, epigenetic DNA modification, and transcription are all tightly linked in prokaryotes.4. Does Mechanotransduction Play a Role in the Prokaryotic Microgravity Response? From the examination of the studies cited above, we have seen that eukaryotic cells possess mechanosensing and mechanotransduction systems that modulate their gene expression in response to microgravity. Further, we have seen from the results of recent studies utilizing model bacterial species that it is becoming increasingly clear that prokaryotes also possess complex intracellular compartmentalization, analogs of cytoskeletal proteins, and sophisticated signal transduction networks comparable to those of eukaryotic cells. These networks serve to sense external environmental cues through surface structures and to transmit this information to the transcription apparatus via traditional signaling pathways such as two-component systems. From the available information and by analogy, we hypothesize that the prokaryotic cytoskeletal apparatus functions in an analogous manner to its eukaryotic counterpart. We further propose that the microbial cytoskeleton plays a key role in transducing mechanical changes sensed at the cell surface to the nucleoid, altering its architecture and the global transcriptional apparatus. Testing of this hypothesis will necessitate conducting new types of experiments in the spaceflight environment, such as: visualization of cytoskeletal structures, mapping of nucleoid architecture, and measurements of DNA supercoiling and methylation patterns, to name a few. As many of these measurements can be very sensitive to differences in sample handling, it will be of high importance in this endeavor to match as precisely as possible media and growth conditions, spaceflight hardware, and pre- and post-flight sample handling, to eliminate all possible variables with the exception of gravity. Ideally, it would be preferable to perform all exposures in the microgravity environment (providing 1 × g by centrifugation) and to perform all inoculations, fixations, freezing, etc. at the same time and using the same protocols. Results from such experiments hold the promise for uncovering a new and fundamental mechanism for microbial adaptation to spaceflight microgravity, mechanosensing and mechanotransduction.Acknowledgments The authors thank Xindan Wang for helpful discussions of Hi-C chromosome capture methodology.Author Contributions P.F.-C. and W.L.N. conceived and wrote the manuscript.

KEYWORDS: Bacillus subtilis, evolution, RNA polymerase, fitness, rifampin, rifampin resistance, transcriptionINTRODUCTION Transcription in bacteria depends on a complex of proteins collectively known as RNA polymerase (RNAP), and bacterial responses to their environment are in large part due to alterations in their global pattern of transcription, i.e., the transcriptome. Because RNAP physically contacts every promoter in the bacterial genome, mutations altering RNAP can exert wide-ranging pleiotropic effects on the transcriptome, and hence, the resulting phenotype and fitness of a cell growing in a particular environment. The antibiotic rifampin (Rif) is a potent inhibitor of prokaryotic transcription initiation (1) and has a long history of use in the treatment of infectious diseases, particularly tuberculosis and leprosy caused by Mycobacterium spp., as well as biofilm-associated infections (2). In addition to its clinical importance, Rif has long been used to probe the structure and function of RNAP. Resistance to Rif (Rifr) arises from mutations in the rpoB gene, encoding the β subunit of RNAP (3). Binding of Rif to RNAP occurs at a specific site on the β subunit, the Rif-binding pocket, which physically blocks the progression of nascent transcripts through the RNA exit channel (4, 5). Mutations conferring Rifr are localized on the primary sequence of rpoB in four regions designated the N cluster and clusters I, II, and III (4, 6). The majority of Rifr mutations occur in cluster I, and elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of RNAP bound to Rif has revealed that the Rif binding pocket consists of several key amino acids within cluster I that make direct contact with Rif (4). In the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, Rifr mutations in rpoB have been shown to affect a number of global phenotypes, including deficiencies in sporulation, competence, growth rate, and yield (7), activation of cryptic genes involved in the utilization of rare carbon sources (8), altered resistance of spores to various sporicidal stresses (9), temperature-sensitive sporulation (10), and spore germination (7). Not all sites in cluster I of rpoB are prone to mutation at equal frequency; some bases mutate at higher frequency (“hot spots”) or lower frequency (“cold spots”). Such patterns of mutation in a gene are referred to as its mutational spectrum (11). In prior communications, we have reported several instances in which the Rifr mutational spectrum in the B. subtilis rpoB gene is changed when cells are cultivated in different physiological environments or when spores are exposed to different environmental extremes (12–17). Most recently, we reported on differences in the spectrum of Rifr mutations between populations grown in complete Miller LB medium (LB) and populations grown in Spizizen minimal medium containing l-asparagine as the sole carbon source (SMMAsn) (18). We observed that the major Rifr amino acid change in LB cultures was H482Y (a change of H to Y at position 482), while the major mutation in SMMAsn cultures was S487L (18). How does exposure of a cell or spore to a particular environment lead to an altered mutational spectrum? At least two explanations for this phenomenon can be posited, which are not mutually exclusive. (i) One of the explanations is that under different physiological conditions, changes in the intracellular environment can cause alterations in nucleoid architecture, DNA supercoiling, and DNA conformation; such structural alterations can alter the probability of mutation at a particular base within a gene. This notion is supported by the observed differences both in DNA structure and in the spectrum of rpoB mutations between vegetative cells and spores in B. subtilis, where the mutagenic spectrum of spores more closely resembled the spectrum observed in clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates (12). Differences in the spectrum of rpoB mutations have also been observed in B. subtilis spores exposed to a number of extreme environmental conditions, including simulated Mars conditions (13), ultrahigh vacuum (19), and exposure to space in low-Earth orbit (15). It should be noted that in the examples listed above, dormant spores themselves were exposed to different environments and then allowed to germinate and grow under the same laboratory conditions; hence, differences in mutational spectrum cannot be attributed to different growth environments. (ii) The second explanation is that growth under selective pressure produces a spectrum of mutations within a population and those mutants with the lowest fitness cost or those with a fitness advantage become more prevalent. Supporting this line of thought, Wrande et al. (20) illustrated that the logarithmic accumulation of Rifr mutations in aging Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli colonies is due to clonal growth of Rifr mutants in localized “jackpots” within the colony. These Rifr alleles were found to have a selective advantage over their respective ancestral strains within the context of these aging colonies. Similarly, study of Rifr Staphylococcus aureus mutants isolated from biofilms revealed that Rifr mutants exhibited greater fitness when cocultured with the wild-type strain in a biofilm liquid culture (21). It is possible that these two mechanisms work together in determining the spectra of mutations in both vegetative cells and spores, due to the integral roles that DNA bending and supercoiling play in regulating bacterial transcription and, in turn, the role that transcription plays in determining DNA architecture (reviewed in references 22, 23, and 24). This inextricable linkage between gene expression and DNA supercoiling makes these notions explaining variations in spectra of mutations difficult to disentangle. To determine whether growth under differing selective pressures is a contributing factor in differences in the spectra of mutations, we report here the development of a competition assay utilizing next-generation-sequencing technology to quantify the fitness of multiple rpoB alleles in a mixed culture simultaneously. We compared the population frequencies of 18 rpoB alleles in mixed cultures grown in two distinct environments: LB and SMMAsn. We found significant differences in the fitness of the various Rifr mutant rpoB alleles in each medium. In LB, the wild-type allele dominated, whereas in SMMAsn, the H482N mutant became the dominant allele present in the population. These results were subsequently confirmed by pairwise competition experiments, as well as assessments of exponential growth rates and lag times.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Levels of Rif resistance conferred by mutant rpoB alleles. The natural environment often contains inhibitory or subinhibitory levels of various antibiotics; thus, natural antibiotic resistance would confer a selective advantage in such environments (reviewed in reference 25). Through our studies of Rifr over the years, we have amassed a collection of congenic B. subtilis strains, each carrying 1 of 17 different Rifr mutations in rpoB (Table 1). We measured the levels of Rifr in these strains by measuring the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for Rif in LB medium by the broth dilution method (Fig. 1). As expected, the wild-type laboratory strain was very sensitive to Rif (IC50 of 0.06 ± 0.01 μg/mL). All mutant rpoB alleles that had been selected on a high concentration of Rif (50 μg/mL) (12, 13) exhibited high IC50 values of >100 μg/mL, whereas mutant rpoB alleles selected on a low concentration of Rif (5 μg/mL) (17) exhibited generally lower IC50 values, ranging from 4 to 84 μg/mL, the lowest of which was still at least 67-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain (Fig. 1). Thus, in the context of growth in a selective environment containing Rif, all the Rifr rpoB mutants would be expected to be more fit than the wild-type strain. TABLE 1.

FIG 1. Open in a new tab Determination of IC50 values of Rif in B. subtilis strains used in this study. Results are presented as averages ± standard deviations (n = 3). w.t., wild type.Growth rates of rpoB mutants in LB cultures. In the absence of Rif selection, it has been noted previously that mutations in rpoB leading to Rifr often exert a fitness cost, such as a lower growth rate as measured in standard laboratory media (26; reviewed in reference 27). To test this notion, we measured the growth rates of wild-type B. subtilis and 17 congenic rpoB mutants in individual liquid-LB shake flask cultures (Fig. 2). It was observed that 10 of the 17 rpoB mutant strains grew significantly more slowly than the wild type (Fig. 2), consistent with the notion that rpoB mutations can exert a fitness cost (26). However, 8 of the 17 rpoB mutants grew at a rate statistically indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain (Fig. 2). The results indicate that not all Rifr mutants exhibit lowered fitness in LB under standard laboratory conditions, as measured by growth rate. FIG 2. Open in a new tab Growth rates of B. subtilis strains cultivated in liquid LB in shake flasks with aeration.

The growth rate experiments described above were performed on individual strains in monoculture, which may not reflect their true fitness in a complex competitive environment such as would likely prevail in nature. Therefore, to directly compare the fitness of rpoB alleles, we performed, in triplicate cultures, a multigenerational and multistrain competition experiment in which the wild-type strain and all 17 Rifr rpoB mutant strains were competed simultaneously in LB (Fig. 3). At daily (∼7-generation) intervals, the proportion of each rpoB allele in the mixed population was determined by next-generation sequencing of two ∼500-bp PCR amplicons spanning either the N cluster or clusters I, II, and III of the rpoB gene (Fig. 3A). At generation zero of the experiment, each rpoB allele was present at ∼5 to 6% of the total population. By generation 35, the wild-type strain came to dominate all three cultures, and the proportion of most Rifr mutant alleles had dropped below the level of detection (∼0.1%) (Fig. 3A). Two Rifr rpoB mutants persisted until the end of the experiment, the H482N and A478D variants. Although the growth rate of the H482N mutant was not significantly higher than that of the wild-type strain when grown separately in monoculture (Fig. 2), the mutant appeared to be less fit in a competitive environment (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the A478D mutant appeared to almost disappear from the population by 14 generations, but beginning at ∼35 generations, it increased again in frequency to an average of ∼25% of the population by generation 49 (Fig. 3A). This anomalous result prompted us to more closely examine the allelic frequencies of the wild-type, H482N, and A478D strains in each of the three replicate mixed cultures. We observed that in two of the three replicate cultures, the A478D allele behaved like the majority of the Rifr rpoB mutations, becoming reduced to a very low, barely detectable frequency (Fig. 3B and C). In contrast, in the third culture, the A478D mutant initially dropped below the limit of detection (∼0.1%), but then starting at ∼generation 35, it increased dramatically in frequency to comprise over 80% of that population by generation 49 (Fig. 3D). Closer examination of the PCR amplicon spanning clusters I, II, and III from the A478D mutant arising after generation 35 in the third culture revealed the appearance of a second mutation in rpoB, I528V. Furthermore, Sanger sequencing of the rpoB gene of a Rifr isolate from this culture, strain WN1663, confirmed the presence of the I528V mutation in addition to the original A478D mutation. These observations led us to suspect that during the competition experiment in the third culture, the original A478D strain had suffered a second-site mutation in rpoB, dramatically increasing its competitive fitness. To determine if this compensatory mutation was responsible for the observed increase in relative fitness, both the ancestral (A478D) and evolved (A478D+I528V) alleles were transferred into a clean wild-type background to create strains WN1658 and WN1662, respectively. To test their competitive fitness, the four congenic strains WN1621 (wild type), WN1658 (A478D), WN1663 (evolved A478+I528V, isolated from the generation 49 culture of the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3D), and WN1662 (A478D+I528V, reconstructed in a wild-type background) were each competed separately against the same isogenic wild-type strain (strain WN624, carrying a spectinomycin resistance [Spcr] marker) in LB medium (Fig. 4). Pairwise competition experiments showed that strain WN1658, the A478D rpoB mutant, was dramatically less fit than the wild type (selection coefficient [S] = −1.26 ± 0.35), whereas the evolved isolate strain WN1663 (A478D+I528V) was dramatically more fit than the wild type (S = +0.84 ± 0.23) (Fig. 4). However, simple reconstruction of the A478D+I528V rpoB double mutation in an otherwise wild-type background (strain WN1662) resulted in only a modest increase in fitness (S = −0.47 ± 0.05) compared to that seen in the single A478D mutant and failed to replicate the dramatic increase in fitness seen in the evolved strain WN1663 (Fig. 4). We therefore conclude that while the second-site mutation I528V in rpoB increased competitive fitness to a certain extent, it was not sufficient to account for the dramatic increase in fitness seen in strain 1663 arising in the third multiallelic competition culture in the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3D. The results lead us to hypothesize that strain WN1663 had sustained genomic mutation(s) in addition to I528V that also contributed to its dramatically increased fitness. These putative additional mutations could be revealed by whole-genome sequencing, which is beyond the scope of the present study. Results from the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3 indicated that, when challenged in a more complex competitive environment (18 rpoB variants growing together for 49 generation in LB medium in the absence of Rif selection), all of the Rifr mutations in rpoB led to a generalized reduction in fitness. This result is somewhat at odds with the conclusions drawn from measurements of growth rates of the same strains in monoculture (Fig. 2), indicating that fitness cannot be predicted by growth rate in monoculture alone.

The multiallele competition experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3 was performed in nutrient-rich LB medium. However, in nature, B. subtilis is found in soils or associated with plants and their roots. Such natural environments are either subjected to “feast or famine” conditions or are chronically oligotrophic; therefore, cells would need to utilize limited quantities of rarer, more ephemeral nutrient sources. In previous work, we performed OmniLog global metabolic profiling on wild-type B. subtilis and 11 Rifr rpoB mutants to assess how mutations in rpoB could affect metabolic capabilities (8). Indeed, we found that several environmental nutrients, normally utilized poorly by the wild-type laboratory strain of B. subtilis, were used significantly better by certain Rifr rpoB mutants. In particular, we noted that a strain carrying the S487L rpoB substitution utilized the amino acids l-alanine, l-asparagine, l-glutamate, and l-serine significantly better than the wild type (8). l-Asparagine specifically has been found to be substantially present in root exudates and plays a significant role in determining the bacterial species composition of the rhizosphere (28). Based on these observations, we were interested in measuring the relative fitness of wild-type and 17 Rifr rpoB mutant strains of B. subtilis in a more stringent selective environment. We therefore modified Spizizen minimal medium by replacing glucose with l-asparagine as the sole carbon source (SMMAsn; see Materials and Methods for details) and again performed a multiallele, multigenerational competition experiment (Fig. 5). Based on its performance in OmniLog metabolic assays (8), we reasoned that the S487L mutant would fare better in this more stringent environment than the wild type or other Rifr mutant strains. FIG 5. Open in a new tab (A) Population dynamics of wild-type (WT) and 17 rpoB mutant strains of B. subtilis in SMMAsn liquid medium grown with aeration at 37°C. Data shown are average values (n = 3). (B to D) Population dynamics of wild-type (WT), D472Y, and H482N strains during the three replicate competition experiments from which the average values in panel A were derived.In the multiallele competition experiment conducted in SMMAsn, each of the 18 strains was initially present at 5 to 6% of the total population (Fig. 5A). As seen earlier in the multiallele competition performed in LB medium (Fig. 3), most of the strains carrying various rpoB mutations dropped out of the population during the course of propagation in SMMAsn (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, in this experiment, we observed that the strain carrying the H482N rpoB mutation rose to dominate the population, gaining an average frequency of ∼70% by generation 49, followed by the strain carrying the D472Y mutation (∼20%) and then the wild-type strain (∼10%) (Fig. 5A). These results were in stark contrast to those obtained in LB medium, where the wild-type strain dominated the population, with the H482N mutant forming a minority (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the strain carrying the S487L mutation, which we predicted would become the most frequent allele, did not succeed in this medium as we had expected but, rather, dropped below the threshold of detection in the population by generation 14 of the competition (Fig. 5A). Comparison of the results presented in Fig. 3 with the results in Fig. 5 demonstrated a dramatic difference in the population dynamics and strain fitness of the same rpoB mutants depending upon whether they were competed in the rich LB or the minimal SMMAsn environment. In addition, the lack of increased competitive fitness displayed by the S487L rpoB mutant competed in SMMAsn (Fig. 5A) brought into question whether an increased utilization of a nutrient, such as l-asparagine, as measured by Omnilog assay (8), is a relevant parameter to predict fitness. During multiallele competition in LB medium, we noted that the A478D rpoB mutant rose to prominence in one of the three replicate cultures (Fig. 3D), presumably due to a second-site mutation(s). Accordingly, we also examined the frequencies of the wild-type, D472Y, and H482N strains in each individual SMMAsn culture (Fig. 5B to D). In this case, all three cultures behaved similarly, with the H482N strain arising to dominate each of the three cultures. This observation suggested that no second-site mutation(s) improving fitness had arisen in the SMMAsn cultures during the course of the multiallele competition experiment.Growth rates and lag times of rpoB mutations in SMMAsn cultures. We sought to further explore the role played by growth rate in the fitness of rpoB mutants by measuring the exponential growth rates during cultivation in SMMAsn of the wild-type B. subtilis strain and congenic mutant strains harboring the D472Y, H482N, or S487L rpoB allele (Fig. 6). In individual SMMAsn monocultures, all three Rifr mutant strains exhibited a significantly increased exponential growth rate compared to the growth rate of the wild-type strain, but there were no statistical differences among the growth rates of the Rifr mutants themselves (Fig. 6A). These results were distinctly different from the relative growth rates of the same strains in LB medium, in which the rpoB mutants either grew more slowly (S487L) or at essentially the same rate (D472Y and H482N) as the wild type (Fig. 2). If the exponential growth rate were the sole determinant of fitness, it would be expected that the three Rifr mutants would have risen to dominate the multiallele competition experiment performed in SMMAsn, but this was clearly not the case (Fig. 5). FIG 6. Open in a new tab Exponential growth rates (A) and lag times (B) in SMMAsn of the wild-type (w.t.) strain and congenic rpoB mutant strains carrying the D472Y, H482N, and S487L variants. Data are averages ± standard deviations (n = 3). **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001 (ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test for multiple comparison to the mean value for the wild type).In addition to the exponential growth rate, the ability of cells to adjust to a new environment is reflected in the lag time preceding exponential growth. In one of the few studies examining this phenomenon in rpoB mutants, it was observed that a Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rifr mutant strain carrying an H526D substitution (the equivalent of the H482D substitution in B. subtilis rpoB) suffered significantly delayed growth following resuscitation from nutrient starvation (29). We thus compared the lag time of the wild-type strain to the lag times of congenic strains carrying the D472Y, H482N, and S487L rpoB variants in SMMAsn. No significant difference was observed in the lag times between the wild type and the D472Y variant; however, both the H482N and S487L variants demonstrated significant increases in lag time relative to that of the wild type (Fig. 6B). In fact, the H482N and S487L variants were statistically indistinguishable in their growth rates (increased over that of the wild type) and lag times (longer than that of the wild type). Taken together, the results shown in Fig. 6 indicated that in SMMAsn medium, the growth rate and/or lag time of individual monocultures corresponded poorly with increased or decreased relative fitness in competition experiments.Pairwise competitions in LB versus SMMAsn. To further examine the discrepancies between the observed growth metrics and the results of our multiallele competition, we performed a pairwise competition for each Rifr mutant strain against the wild-type strain in both LB and SMMAsn media (Fig. 7). The H482N Rifr mutant strain showed the most dramatic fitness difference compared to the fitness of the wild type; it was less fit in LB (S = −0.047 ± 0.01) but more fit (S = +0.403 ± 0.063) in SMMAsn medium (Fig. 7). The S487L mutant was less fit than the wild type in both media, although its fitness in SMMAsn (S = −0.144 ± 0.005) was significantly improved over that in LB (S = −0.337 ± 0.01) (Fig. 7). The D472Y mutant was also less fit than the wild type in both media, but the difference in its fitness between the two media was just above the cutoff for significance (P = 0.061). Measurements of the relative fitness for each mutant rpoB allele in pairwise competition agreed with the results of the multiallelic competitions in SMMAsn. FIG 7. Open in a new tab Pairwise competition experiments. Rifr strains carrying the variant D472Y (strain WN1625), H482N (strain WN1637), or S487L (strain WN761) were each competed against congenic wild-type strain WN1651 in LB or SMMAsn medium for 21 generations, and fitness coefficients (S) were calculated as described previously (54). Data are average values ± standard deviations (n = 3). ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001; ns, not significantly different (two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD test for multiple comparisons).Previous work in our laboratory has shown differing spectra of mutations in the rpoB gene across several different environment (12, 13, 16–18). The reproducibility of these changes in the spectra of mutations indicates that the environment somehow dictates these changes. Multiple studies have found that mutations in the rpoB gene that confer rifampin resistance can provide a fitness advantage or increased growth rate in the environment from which they were isolated. Several examples illustrate the repeated occurrence of rpoB mutations in adaptive laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli, wherein these mutations significantly increased the fitness of the organism in different environments, including optimized growth on various minimal media and increased fitness at elevated temperatures (30–32). Our multiallele, multigenerational competition experiments (Fig. 3 and 5) showed that the wild-type rpoB allele was most fit in nutrient-rich LB medium, while the H482N variant was most fit in populations cultivated in minimal SMMAsn medium. The different rpoB alleles and the corresponding changes in global gene expression associated with them likely explain the differences in relative fitness depending upon the growth environment. Numerous studies suggest changes in global gene expression to be the cause of changes in fitness observed with mutations in rpoB (7, 33–37), although one study examining the system-wide impacts of mutations in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa rpoB gene found few differences in global gene expression and attributed mutant phenotypes to increased expression of RNAP (38). Ultimately, a better understanding of the specific mechanisms behind these differences in fitness will require an examination of global gene expression of these different rpoB alleles in SMMAsn. Which changes in gene expression are specifically responsible for the success of the H482N mutant can only be speculated upon at present, as this particular allele is new to our collection and not yet very well characterized. However, the lack of fitness of the S487L mutant in SMMAsn may be a bit easier to explain. Previous work studying the rpoB-S487L allele in B. subtilis revealed that this particular allele autoinduced the expression of genes responsible for the production of the antibiotic 3,3′-neotrehalosadiamine (NTD), which is not produced by the wild-type strain under the same conditions (39). This autoinduction of NTD production might place a significant metabolic burden on the organism and may be responsible for the lack of relative fitness observed in the rpoB-S487L allele. The discrepancies between fitness and exponential growth rate reveal that, while fairly simple to determine, growth rate is a poor proxy for relative fitness, as a similar study has found (40). Simply measuring the exponential growth rate fails to account for differences in fitness during stationary and lag phase, in addition to potential antagonistic or cooperative interactions between the strains when competing for the same resources, such as dramatic acidification of the medium (41). Our study highlights the danger of conflating exponential growth rates or results from simplified metabolic assays (8) with relative fitness. Three Rifr rpoB variants exhibited an increased growth rate relative to the growth rate of the wild-type strain in SMMAsn (Fig. 6); however, only one of those variants (H482N) proved to be more fit than the wild-type strain in the same medium (Fig. 7). There are many potential explanations for this discrepancy that could be controlled at the transcriptional level, such as increased probability of differentiation in the stationary phase (42) or shaping of the environment by an evolved variant in a manner that preferentially benefits itself (41, 43). Unlike other results from this study, the increased relative fitness of the evolved strain WN1663 cannot be explained solely by a compensatory mutation in rpoB (Fig. 4). Our data indicate that other changes within the B. subtilis genome must account for the observed sweep of the population by WN1663. The increase in fitness of the A478D+I528V double mutant relative to the fitness of the A478D single mutant is consistent with other studies that have reported the ability of compensatory mutations in rpoB and rpoC to restore fitness defects (44–46). However, these studies did not find increases in fitness relative to that of the wild-type allele. In summary, this study illustrates the fitness impacts of rpoB alleles in different environments, highlights the deficiencies of growth or metabolic metrics of monocultures as a sole measure of relative fitness, and demonstrates the role of compensatory mutations in rpoB to recover fitness cost.MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains, media, plasmids, and growth conditions. All B. subtilis strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. The strains were constructed by DNA-mediated transformation of competent cells with purified genomic DNA as previously described (47). The complex media used were Miller LB medium (48) and Trypticase-soy-yeast extract (TSY) medium (49). The minimal medium used was Spizizen minimal medium (50) containing the auxotrophic requirements tryptophan and phenylalanine (50 μg/mL each) and asparagine (95 mM) in place of glucose as the carbon source (SMMAsn). Media were solidified with agar (15 g/L) as needed. The antibiotics used (final concentration) were chloramphenicol (10 μg/mL), rifampin (5 μg/mL), kanamycin (5 μg/mL), neomycin (5 μg/mL), or spectinomycin (100 μg/mL). Plasmids for CRISPR-Cas9 introduction of point mutations were constructed and used as previously described (51). Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted via inverse PCR as previously described (52) to introduce the point mutation A478V into an rpoB template. All mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Genewiz LLC) of PCR amplicons.Rif IC50 determination. For quantification of Rifr, an overnight culture of each strain was grown in liquid TSY without antibiotics. One microliter of overnight culture was inoculated into 100 μl of liquid TSY medium without Rif or containing Rif at a 2-fold range of concentrations from 4 to 256 μg/mL. Cells were grown in 96-well microtiter plates sealed with gas-permeable membranes (Breathe-Easy; Sigma-Aldrich). Growth at 37°C was measured by the optical density at 620 nm (OD620) at 15-minute intervals in a temperature-controlled microplate absorbance spectrophotometer (model ELx808; BioTek). The resulting growth data from triplicate experiments were then used to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50).Growth rate and lag time determinations. Liquid cultures were propagated in 125-mL sidearm (Klett) flasks in 10 mL of LB at 37°C in a rotary shaking bath with vigorous aeration. Growth was measured at 15-minute intervals by the OD660 using a Klett-Summerson colorimeter fitted with the no. 66 (red, 660-nm) filter. Growth rates were calculated from the exponential portion of each growth curve. Lag times were determined from the point of intersection of the lag and exponential portions of each growth curve. Growth rates and lag times were determined from triplicate cultures. Data sets were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test online calculator (https://www.statskingdom.com/shapiro-wilk-test-calculator.html), and all data sets were found to be normally distributed. Statistical parameters and tests of significance (analysis of variance [ANOVA]) were computed using KaleidaGraph version 4.5.2 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA).Competition assays. Individual overnight cultures of the wild-type strain and all congenic Rifr strains were inoculated into fresh individual 2-mL LB cultures. Upon entering stationary phase, the OD660 of each culture was measured and a volume corresponding to ∼108 cells of each strain was combined into a single mixed culture, which was then diluted 1:100 into 10 mL of either LB or SMMAsn in 125-mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Cultures were grown at 37°C in a temperature-controlled rotary shaking bath at 200 rpm. Every 24 h, cultures were diluted 1:100 into fresh medium. Under these conditions, cultures progress through ∼7 generations per day (53). For multiallelic competition experiments, every 24 h, from each culture, a 1-mL aliquot was pelleted for chromosomal DNA extraction; 0.8 mL was stored in 25% (vol/vol) glycerol at −70°C, and 0.1 mL was diluted serially 10-fold in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), plated on LB with chloramphenicol (Cm), and incubated overnight at 37°C for total viable counts. For two-allele competition experiments, every 24 h, 0.1 mL of each culture was serially diluted and plated on two different LB plates, each supplemented with a different antibiotic. These LB plates were then incubated overnight at 37°C to determine the viable counts of each strain. Relative fitness was quantified with a previously described selection coefficient model (54).Next-generation library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis. From purified chromosomal DNA, two ∼500-bp amplicons of the rpoB gene, one spanning the N cluster and one spanning clusters I, II, and III, were amplified by PCR using Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the corresponding primer pairs (Table 2). PCR products were purified (Qiagen PCR purification kit) and quantified by Qubit fluorometry, and equal amounts were combined for library preparation. Next-generation sequencing libraries were prepared using an Illumina Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit with some modifications. Due to the high levels of NaOH in the Nextera XT bead-based normalization process, the native normalization process is not compatible with the iSeq100. In place of the bead-based normalization process, normalization was performed manually by capillary electrophoresis using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 expert software to calculate the molar amount of DNA fragments in each library. Equivalent amounts of DNA fragments from 24 individual libraries were pooled at a final DNA fragment concentration of 4 nM. Pooled libraries were diluted to 50 pM prior to loading into an Illumina i1 reagent box and sequenced on an Illumina iSeq100 next-generation-sequencing platform. TABLE 2.

Raw data from the iSeq100 was demultiplexed and converted to fastq files using Illumina bcl2fastq software. Quality control of reads was performed with FastQC (55). Quality reads were mapped to the Bacillus subtilis strain 168 reference genome (GenBank accession number AL009126.3) using Bowtie 2 (56). From mapped reads, LoFreq (57) was used to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small deletions in the rpoB gene. Preliminary calibration experiments performed with known proportions of mutant rpoB alleles established that the lower limit of detection was ∼0.1% (data not shown).Statistical analysis. All data sets were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk method (58). Data sets passing the normality test were analyzed for differences by ANOVA with Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test (59) or Dunnett’s test for multiple comparison analysis (60). All statistical analyses were performed with the statistical graphing software Prism (GraphPad Software). Differences with a P value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the Department of Microbiology and Cell Science at the University of Florida for use of the iSeq100 instrument.
