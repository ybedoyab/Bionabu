    "abstract": "Abstract Background Understanding of gravity sensing and response is critical to long-term human habitation in space and can provide new advantages for terrestrial agriculture. To this end, the altered gene expression profile induced by microgravity has been repeatedly queried by microarray and RNA-seq experiments to understand gravitropism. However, the quantification of altered protein abundance in space has been minimally investigated.Results Proteomic (iTRAQ-labelled LC-MS/MS) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analyses simultaneously quantified protein and transcript differential expression of three-day old, etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown aboard the International Space Station along with their ground control counterparts. Protein extracts were fractionated to isolate soluble and membrane proteins and analyzed to detect differentially phosphorylated peptides. In total, 968 RNAs, 107 soluble proteins, and 103 membrane proteins were identified as differentially expressed. In addition, the proteomic analyses identified 16 differential phosphorylation events. Proteomic data delivered novel insights and simultaneously provided new context to previously made observations of gene expression in microgravity. There is a sweeping shift in post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation including RNA-decapping protein DCP5, the splicing factors GRP7 and GRP8, and AGO4,. These data also indicate AHA2 and FERONIA as well as CESA1 and SHOU4 as central to the cell wall adaptations seen in spaceflight. Patterns of tubulin-α 1, 3,4 and 6 phosphorylation further reveal an interaction of microtubule and redox homeostasis that mirrors osmotic response signaling elements. The absence of gravity also results in a seemingly wasteful dysregulation of plastid gene transcription.Conclusions The datasets gathered from Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to microgravity revealed marked impacts on post-transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics, and plastid gene transcription. The impact of post-transcriptional regulatory alterations represents an unstudied element of the plant microgravity response with the potential to significantly impact plant growth efficiency and beyond. What’s more, addressing the effects of microgravity on AHA2, CESA1, and alpha tubulins has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing biomass production and growth in microgravity. Finally, understanding and manipulating the dysregulation of plastid gene transcription has further potential to address the goal of enhancing plant growth in the stressful conditions of microgravity.Keywords: Gravity, Spaceflight, Arabidopsis, Gravitropism, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Phosphorylation, Post-transcriptional gene regulation, Plastid",

    "methods": "Methods Plant material Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyn. var. Columbia (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Stock ID: CS22625), were used for all experiments. Aliquots of 0.016 ± 0.002 g of seeds (approximately 800–900 seeds per plate) were surface sterilized with 30% (v/v) bleach and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 for 2 min, washed with sterile water (5x), then dried onto 60 mm round filter paper to facilitate plating. Seeds were spread onto 60 mm round Petri plates containing 0.5 X Murashige and Skoog (MS) media (Caisson, Smithfield, UT) with 1% sucrose and 1% agar, cold stratified overnight, and provided a 1 h white light treatment to facilitate consistent germination. Spaceflight parameters Twenty-two seeded plates were then individually integrated into Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs), and RNALater (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA) was loaded into the liquid reservoir. PDFUs were then tested for leaks and loaded into Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware for flight: five plates plus a HOBO data logger in two BRICs and six plates in the remaining two BRICs. All BRICs were put into cold stowage (4 °C) prior to launch. The experiment was launched aboard Space-X 5 on January 10, 2015. Upon docking of the Dragon capsule to the International Space Station (ISS), the BRICs were removed from cold stowage and placed at ambient temperature (ca. 21 °C). After 76 h, the PDFUs were actuated releasing RNAlater into the Petri dish for seedling fixation. Samples were incubated at ambient temperature in RNAlater for 12 h then placed at − 80 °C in the MELFI freezer aboard ISS. Twenty-two additional plates were integrated into hardware as ground controls and maintained under identical growth conditions and processing on a 48 h delay. These were held at Kennedy Space Center with environmental conditions aboard ISS provided via downlink. After the spaceflight samples returned from ISS, both spaceflight and ground control plates were removed from the hardware while frozen and packed in dry ice at Kennedy Space Center, then transported to Ohio University in a temperature-controlled vehicle. In addition to the Kennedy Ground control, two additional controls were set up to check if the spaceflight hardware or the preservative RNAlater were causing any significant changes in the transcriptome and proteome of Arabidopsis seedlings. Details of the hardware and preservative studies have been published in Basu et al. [41] and Kruse et al. [42], respectively. All pertinent datasets are publicly available on the NASA GeneLab repository. RNA extraction and processing RNA was extracted according to Kruse et al. [39, 41]. In brief, three biological replicates, one plate per replicate, were used for RNA-seq analysis. RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Plant Mini Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to standard protocols. RNA integrity (RIN ≥ 8) was verified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA samples were sent to the Genome Technology Access Center in the Department of Genetics at Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO. Paired-end sequence was obtained from an Illumina 2500 Hiseq (2 X 101 bp) using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit prior to library preparation. Read pairs for each biological replicate were aligned to TAIR10 [43, 44] assembly using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) [45]. Gene level read counts were determined using HTSeq-count. For transcript/isoform analysis, Sailfish (v0.9.0) was used for splice aware transcript quantification [46]. Differential expression was determined using the generalized linear model likelihood test within the Empirical Analysis of Digital Gene Expression Data in R (EdgeR) package [47, 48]. Protein extraction and data analysis Soluble and membrane proteins were extracted and processed according to Basu et al. [40]. In brief, seedlings from five plates, were pooled for each of the 3 replicates. Seedlings were crushed in liquid nitrogen and vortexed thoroughly in extraction buffer. Sample were then centrifuged at 100,000 g to isolate the membrane proteins. The supernatant was saved and used for the extraction of soluble proteins. Samples were sent to the Proteomics & Mass Spectrometry Facility at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (St. Louis, MO) for processing, iTRAQ labeling, and tandem mass spectrometry of protein samples as detailed in [49, 50]. Briefly, protein concentration of each replicate was estimated using CBX assay. Equal amounts (40 μg) of both membrane and soluble, three replicates each, were digested with trypsin and labeled with a unique iTRAQ 8plex (AB SCIEX, Massachusetts, USA). The labeled replicates were pooled and fractionated using high pH reverse phase chromatography [40, 51]. The fractions were combined into 12 final fractions for LC-MS/MS using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Mass spectrometry data analyses were automated using Mascot Daemon 2.5 (Matrix Science, London, UK). The TAIR10 database was used as a reference (including target and decoy sequences, 35,386 entries) assuming trypsin digestion. To identify post-translational modifications using Mascot, the modifications due to iTRAQ 8-plex labeling of lysine and the N-terminus of the peptides and carbamidomethyl of cysteine were specified as fixed modifications. The variable modifications were specified as deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine, and phosphorylation of serine/threonine and tyrosine. Only proteins with at least two peptides with score > 20 were reported. A Student’s t-test was used to determine significant difference between protein expression in spaceflight and ground control conditions. In accordance with previous studies demonstrating smaller but impactful variations in protein abundance, proteins with a p-value ≤0.05 and a log fold change greater than 0.2 or less than − 0.2 were considered significantly different between experimental and control samples [49, 51]. Individual peptides containing post-translational modifications were examined evaluated using a Student’s t-test to determine phosphorylation events that were altered by spaceflight conditions. A hypergeometric distribution test was used to determine if overlap between proteomic and transcriptomic candidates was non-random. The hypergeometric P-value was calculated using p = (kCx) ((n-k)C(n-x)) /NCn, where N is the number of genes in the genome (estimated at 27,000 for this work), k is the number of genes identified by RNAseq, n is the number of genes identified by proteomics, x is the number of overlapping candidates, and kCx is the number of possible gene combinations. Exclusions based on control experiments In addition to the ground control at Kennedy Space Center, two additional analyses were run to provide insight into whether the spaceflight hardware [41] or the preservative RNAlater [42] caused significant changes in the transcriptome and proteome of Arabidopsis seedlings. Comparing differentially expressed genes and proteins from these additional control studies with those from the spaceflight/ground control analysis revealed 263 genes and 159 proteins significantly affected by both hardware and spaceflight while 249 genes and 152 proteins were affected both by RNAlater and spaceflight. Rather than excluding all genes found in these secondary controls, a logical decision rule (Eq. 1) was developed to identify genes which were more or differently perturbed by spaceflight than either control study. All genes and proteins that passed the decision rule were considered differentially expressed despite their altered expression in a control study. The decision rule, RangeLFCcontrolLFCSF>LFCcontrolorLFCSF>LFCcontrol 1 where LFCcontrol is the log2 fold change of a gene in the control study where it showed significant differential expression and LFCSF is the log2 fold change of a gene in the spaceflight/ground control experiment, allows genes to be retained if the impact of spaceflight was different than the effect of either the preservative or hardware control. Subcellular analyses Differentially expressed transcripts and proteins were analyzed using SUBA4 [13] (V.4.6.0, accessed June 2017) to identify the subcellular localization of differentially expressed genes. Only transcripts with a log-fold change ±1 (FDR ≤ 0.05) or proteins with a log-fold change ±0.2 (P ≤ 0.05) were included in the analysis. Multi-level pie charts were rendered to identify the distribution of localization among subsets of genes. Gene ontology enrichment analyses Gene Ontology (GO) enrichments were performed for Biological Processes using Python based tool, Orange [52] (V.3.7.0, GO terms accessed June 2017). Only transcripts with a log-fold change ±1 (FDR ≤ 0.05) or proteins with a log-fold change ±0.2 (P ≤ 0.05) were included in the analysis. The upregulated and downregulated genes were run separately, and the resultant GO enrichments were thinned to include GO terms with a p-value ≤0.05 using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons that had at least 4 and no more than 750 reference genes within the term (to exclude poorly annotated terms and overly broad terms, respectively) and that had more than one differentially expressed gene within the experimental dataset. Of the remaining GO terms, only the two terms with minimal distance from biological process within each branch were included. When redundant terms (terms containing identical gene sets and with similar naming) were found, only the most informative GO term was retained. A visual representation of the resulting enrichments was created by analyzing enrichment of associated GO terms and creating a heat map. The heat map was generated using the R packages “RColorBrewer” and “gplots.”",
    "results": "Results The BRIC-20 experiment examined the proteomes and transcriptomes of etiolated 3-day old Arabidopsis seedlings grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and identical samples grown on Earth. Arabidopsis seeds were densely planted on 0.5x MS agar plates supplemented with sucrose and germinated on orbit. After 76 h of etiolated growth within the Biological Research in Cannisters (BRIC) hardware, seedlings were fixed with RNAlater and frozen until return to earth. Total protein, divided into soluble and insoluble fractions, and RNA, were extracted from the samples. RNA-seq reads were obtained by Illumina HiSeq 2500. Proteins were ITRAQ-labeled, and discovery proteomics was performed using LC-MS/MS. Total protein levels, as well as PTMs, were compared between flight and ground samples with a decision rule of P ≤ 0.1 to allow for PTM detection in the absence of phosphoenrichment. MS/MS data revealed a subset of phosphorylation events that were significantly (P ≤ 0.1) differentially abundant in space compared to earth. Overall, 968 genes, 107 soluble proteins, and 103 membrane proteins were identified as significantly differentially expressed (P ≤ 0.05) between spaceflight and ground conditions (Fig. 1). At the transcript level, 480 genes were upregulated and 488 genes were downregulated (at a L2FC of ≥ ±1; 2-fold differential expression) in space as compared to on Earth; 45 membrane and 21 soluble proteins were more abundant in space and 58 membrane and 86 soluble proteins were less abundant in space (L2FC of ≥ ± 0.2). In addition to the differentially expressed proteins, we also observed 16 peptides that were differentially phosphorylated in microgravity (P ≤ 0.1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Overview of transcripts (top) and proteins (bottom) differentially expressed during spaceflight. RNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry was performed on space-flown Arabidopsis seedlings and compared to ground controls. The number adjacent to each sector label indicates the count of genes/proteins that occupy the slice. Subcellular localizations are shown in the outermost circles. SUBA4 [13] (V.4.6.0, accessed June 2017) was used to identify the subcellular localizations. Gene/protein accessions and expression values are provided in Supplemental File 1 The subcellular localization of the differential proteins and the proteins encoded by the differentially expressed transcripts was assessed using SUBA4 [13]. One of the most overt differences in cellular localization was the > 25% of transcripts upregulated in spaceflight being localized to the plastid compared to < 1% of the transcripts upregulated on Earth (Fig. 1). This change was not reflected in the protein data and provides a primary indication of dysregulation of plastid genes in the absence of gravity despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of chloroplast development in etiolated seedlings. Extracellular localization was only observed in the soluble proteins downregulated in space, with 8 extracellular localized proteins. These proteins are primarily regulators of oxidation and cell wall dynamics (Table 1). Table 1.

In an effort to identify trends in altered physiological function, four discrete groupings of molecular data were analyzed: 1) proteins that were in more abundance in spaceflight samples; 2) proteins more abundant on Earth, 3) transcripts more abundant in the spaceflight samples, and 4) transcripts more abundant on Earth (Fig. 2). Four key features of transcriptomic and proteomic datasets reveal novel physiological adaptations in spaceflight and simultaneously demonstrate the utility of this mixed ‘omics approach. First, genes regulating cell wall organization processes are enriched among upregulated proteins and downregulated transcripts. The differential phosphorylation, protein, and gene expression data all reveal specific aspects of a nuanced regulatory shift in cell-wall related processes as a part of the change associated with microgravity. Second, redox homeostasis and a broad set of GO terms related to reactive oxygen species production and metabolism are enriched among the up and down regulated transcripts but not mirrored in the differentially expressed proteins. A third intriguing feature is the upregulation of plastid-localized gene transcription despite the seedlings being etiolated (as the hardware allows no light to enter). Finally, there is a pervasive shift in the regulation of translation and post-transcriptional regulation as a whole that is solely enriched at the protein level. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Heat map of a gene ontology enrichment analysis of genes/proteins differentially upregulated in space (left) or upregulated on Earth (right). The central callouts list the differentially expressed genes/proteins within the selected GO term. Enrichment was performed for GO terms for biological processes using Orange (V.3.7.0, GO terms were accessed July 2017). Only transcripts with a log-fold change ±1 (FDR ≤ 0.05) or proteins with a log-fold change ±0.2 (P ≤ 0.05) were included in the analysis. The upregulated and downregulated genes were run separately, and the resultant GO enrichments were thinned to include GO terms with a p-value ≤0.05 using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Numbers next to the terms represent the number of genes or proteins that appeared in that term, followed by the total number genes or proteins associated with that term. Supporting data can be found in Supplemental File 2 Post-transcriptional gene regulation, alternative splicing, and post-translational modifications To determine if any of the proteins identified were altered independent of transcript levels, we compared the lists of significantly altered transcripts (P ≤ 0.05; L2FC of ≥1) and the list of significantly altered proteins (P ≤ 0.05; L2FC of ≥0.2). Of the genes and proteins showing differential expression/abundance as a result of spaceflight, only 17 appeared in both the RNA and protein datasets (Fig. 3, Table 2) representing 2 and 8% of mRNAs and proteins, respectively. Of the 17 in this group, 12 showed consistent direction of expression (i.e. both increased or both decreased). The remaining five showed expression in opposing directions between the transcript and protein. Hypergeometric distribution analysis indicated a significant (p = 0.036) correlation between these gene sets when considering only the genes that show consistent direction of expression, and a more dramatic correlation when including all 17 overlapping genes (p = 9.7 e− 4). A cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (dPGM, AT5G04120) predicted to be involved in glycolysis was upregulated in both datasets in response to spaceflight [14]. Given the etiolated seedlings were grown on sucrose media, this shift in a regulatory component of glycolysis may be representative of an important metabolic target for spaceflight adaptation. Inversely, AT1G19530—an epsilon catalytic subunit A of DNA polymerase—was consistently downregulated in proteomic and transcriptomic analyses (Fig. 3). Notably, a probable aquaporin protein belonging to the tonoplast intrinsic protein family (TIP3.2) was significantly more abundant in space despite TIP3.2 transcripts being more than four-fold downregulated. Of the 17 genes and proteins coordinately differentially expressed, nearly 30% of these genes show opposite directions of differential expression like TIP3.2. Thus, post-transcriptional gene regulation may have important implications for adjustment to spaceflight. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Genes/proteins differentially expressed in both transcript and protein datasets. Of the 17 genes, 12 have coordinated expression patterns (i.e. increased or decreased in both the transcript and protein data), while 5 genes exhibit opposing expression patterns between datasets. X-axis = transcript expression, Y-axis = protein expression. Boxes indicated gene/protein name of the associated point. Some of the most extreme expression patterns highlight TONOPLAST INTRINSIC PROTEIN 3–2 (AT1G17810), a cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (dPGM, AT5G04120), and a DNA-polymerase epsilon catalytic subunit A (AT1G19530) within the datasetsTable 2.

Transcript and protein levels for many ribosomal subunits were altered between Earth and microgravity, which may have an impact on the translational dynamics of the cell. Twelve transcripts for ribosomal proteins were differentially expressed, with only one, a structural component, downregulated nearly 8-fold in space (Table 3). The remaining 11 were upregulated in the spaceflight samples. Medina [15] suggested that changes in ribosome biosynthesis as a result of microgravity caused an uncoupling of cellular growth and cellular proliferation [15]. The differential expression of various tRNAs and the increased abundance of proteins related to post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and translational initiation (enriched in proteins upregulated and downregulated in spaceflight, respectively) suggest an even more substantial impact on regulatory dynamics induced by spaceflight (Fig. 2; Supplemental File 2). The increased protein expression of RNA DECAPPING PROTEIN 5 (DCP5, AT1G26110, L2FCmembrane = 0.32) and the RNA-silencing protein ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4, AT2G27040, L2FCsoluble = 0.44, L2FCRNA = 0.78) further indicate an increased mRNA turnover and siRNA-mediated gene silencing while coping with microgravity. Perhaps the most novel finding relating to this regulatory shift is found in the PTM data. EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR ISOFORM 4G-1, GTP BINDING ELONGATION FACTOR TU FAMILY, ELONGATION FACTOR 1-DELTA 1, and a Trigger Factor Type Chaperone family protein all had differential levels of phosphorylation (Table 4) suggesting an additional mechanism for regulating translation. Among these phosphorylation events, we also see evidence for differential splicing as an adaptation to spaceflight. The RNA-binding proteins GRP7 and GRP8, both regulators of alternative splicing [16], were preferentially phosphorylated on Earth at the S118 residue in response to microgravity (L2FCphospho = − 0.39 and − 0.54, respectively) (Table 5). This suggests an alteration in splicing patterns within the plant in response to spaceflight. A splice aware analysis of transcripts identified 24 genes with at least two transcripts differentially expressed (Fig. S1). VILLIN 1, PEROXIN 11E, NATURAL RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED MACROPHAGE PROTEIN 1 isoforms that are inversely differentially expressed by spaceflight. For example, the actin binding protein VILLIN 1 isoforms AT2G29890.2 (L2FCRNA > 5) and AT2G29890.3 (L2FCRNA < − 7.5) approach complete silencing in space and on earth respectively (Additional file 3: Fig. S1). The altered ratio of gene isoforms confirms that transcripts are subject to altered processing in microgravity. Table 3.

Three E3 ligase mRNAs were altered by a L2FC of ≥ ±1 including ARABIDOPSIS TOXICOS EN LEVADURA 9 (ATL9, AT2G35000, L2FCRNA = − 1.1), BOI-RELATED GENE 2 (BRG2, AT1G79110, L2FCRNA = 1.9), and RING-H2 FINGER PROTEIN 2B (RHA2B, AT2G01150, L2FCRNA = 1.0). ATL9, expressed in an NADPH-dependent matter, has been implicated in pathogen response due to its chitin-mediated expression, but is not upregulated in response to the canonical defense hormones [17]. BRG2 is a member of a subclass of RING-type E3 ligases which contribute Botrytis cinerea resistance and mediate stress and pathogen responses [18]. Finally, the E3 ligase RHA2B has an additive effect with its closest homolog, RHA2A, in regulating ABA and drought response [19]. In addition to the standard E3 ligases, five members of the F-box superfamily, PHLOEM PROTEIN 2-A13 (PP2-A13, AT3G61060, L2FCRNA = − 2.0), AT3G27150 (L2FCRNA = − 1.7), PHLOEM PROTEIN 2-A14 (PP2-A14, AT5G52120, L2FCRNA = 1.5), and AT1G23390 (L2FCRNA = − 1.3) were differentially expressed. Other components of the regulated proteolysis pathway were also altered. REGULATORY PARTICLE AAA-ATPASE 2A (RPT2a, L2FCSoluble = − 0.32) and a 26S proteasome regulatory subunit (RPN7, AT4G24820, L2FCSoluble = − 0.76) were both downregulated in spaceflight samples. NUCLEAR ENCODED CLP PROTEASE 5 (CLPP5, L2FCSoluble = 0.56), SIGNAL PEPTIDE PEPTIDASE (SPPA, L2FCMembrane = 0.21), and the peptidase SHOU4 (AT1G78880, L2FCMembrane = 0.81) were all upregulated in space. An additional 23 proteases were altered at the transcript level (Additional file 1). Overall, microgravity-grown plants appear to display changes in the capacity to produce, regulate, and degrade proteins. Cell Wall synthesis in the spaceflight environment Microgravity has been shown to have a significant impact on plant growth [20, 21]. In these datasets, the most obviously impact is seen in differential expression and regulation of components of cell wall modification. At the protein level, a number of UDP-D-Xylose synthases, transferases, and hydrolases (XT2, GUT1, XS1,XS2, XTH19) were upregulated in microgravity, along with a putative plasmodesmata localized BETA-1,3-GLUCANASE (BG_PPAP, AT5G42100). Quantitative tracking of PTMs has revealed several novel aspects of spaceflight acclimation in plants, including alterations in cell wall synthesis (Table 5). PLASMA MEMBRANE PROTON ATPASE 2 (AHA2) was differentially phosphorylated between flight and ground controls. AHA2 has been implicated as the link between auxin and acid growth. The redistribution of auxin in response to tropic stimulus initiates transcription of SAUR19, which in turn inhibits a PP2C-D phosphatase allowing for AHA2-mediated acidification of the cell wall and subsequent cellular elongation [22]. The phosphorylated form of AHA2 was more abundant on Earth (L2FCphospho = − 0.36) (Table 5). Components involved in cellulose deposition also showed altered transcription. CELLULOSE SYNTHASE 1(CESA1) phosphorylation was increased in spaceflight samples (L2FCphospho = 0.23) (Table 3) while, Tubulin-α 1, 3,4 and 6, required for cellulose patterning, were preferentially phosphorylated on Earth (L2FCphospho = − 0.24, − 0.26, − 0.24 and − 0.24 respectively) (Table 5) at T349; phosphorylation at T349 is known to encourage microtubule depolymerization [23]. While many plant processes are modulated by auxin, auxin-mediated asymmetric cellular elongation is the primary effector of directional growth responses, including gravitropism, and is an essential component in the regulation of cell wall growth and elongation. Many of the auxin-related pathways are clearly perturbed in response to microgravity, with representatives from many aspects of auxin signaling and response appearing in either the protein or the gene expression dataset. Both of the enzymes in the primary synthesis pathway from tryptophan to IAA are represented. The first, L-tryptophan-pyruvate-aminotransferase 1 (L2FCRNA = 0.82), is upregulated nearly two-fold. The transcript for the second enzyme, indole-3-pyruvate-monooxegenase (YUCCA6, L2FCRNA = -0.86), was downregulated nearly two-fold in spaceflight samples. This expression pattern could result in an increased level of Indole-3-pyruvate —the final precursor in auxin synthesis—along with a decrease in conversion of Indole-3-pyruvate to IAA (primary active form of auxin) because of the decreased level of YUCCA6. Several of the genes responsible for auxin redistribution were also present in the datasets. Five auxin carriers were differentially expressed in total: PIN2 (AT5G57090, L2FCRNA = -0.77), PIN-like7 (AT5G65980, L2FCRNA = -0.95), and ABCB15 (AT3G28345, L2FCRNA = -0.87) were down-regulated in space, while PIN-FORMED 4 (PIN4, AT2G01420, L2FCRNA = 0.77) and LAX2 (AT2G21050, L2FCRNA = 0.87) were up-regulated, suggesting that space-grown plants are altering their auxin distribution in response to the space-flight environment. In addition to auxin biosynthesis and transport, auxin perception and response were also perturbed. AUXIN SIGNALING F BOX PROTEIN 1 (AFB1, AT4G03190, L2FCmembrane = − 0.11), a member of the TIR1 family, was less abundant in microgravity in the protein dataset. Auxin-responsive proteins IAA5 (L2FCRNA = 2.83) and IAA28 (L2FCRNA = -0.84) genes were found to be differentially expressed, as well as Auxin-response factors ARF4 (L2FCRNA = 0.81) and ARF11 (L2FCRNA = 0.72). Two small auxin-upregulated RNA (SAUR) genes (both downregulated) and five SAUR-like genes (3 downregulate, 2 upregulated) were differentially expressed in microgravity. These have been shown to be auxin-responsive regulators of adaptive growth, and may be responsible for modulating new growth patterns in the absence of gravity [24]. Whether auxin is the predominant regulator of cell wall related adaptions remains to be seen, however, the characterization provided by transcript, protein and PTM data provides an enhanced understanding of cell wall regulatory dynamics—a primary target for optimization of plant growth in space. Influences on plastid function and regulation Genes and terms relating to plastid function were among the most pronounced features of the subcellular localization (Fig. 1) and the gene ontology enrichment analysis (Fig. 2). Notably, the enrichment of genes associated with chlorophyll biosynthetic process, protein import into chloroplast stroma, plastid membrane organization, protein targeting to chloroplast, and chloroplast organization were seen in the transcript dataset (Fig. 2; Additional file 2). These results were unexpected because seedlings were sealed inside PDFU’s, which were then sealed inside the BRIC. This environment provides no light to initiate chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast development Although plastids play an important role in gravity perception through the sedimentation of dense amyloplasts in the root cap and shoot endodermis, many of the differentially expressed genes (e.g. chlorophyll synthase) relate to photosynthesis, rather than amyloplast-related functions. This may suggest a microgravity-induced disruption in plastid operation that goes beyond gravity perception and may impact metabolic-based plastid processes. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis for the transcript data revealed significant enrichment in terms such as plastid translation, protein import into the stroma, targeting to chloroplast, and plastid organization (Fig. 2; Supplemental File 2). The increased transcript expression of plastid ribosomal proteins SVR8 (AT5G54600, L2FCRNA = 1.01), PSRP3/1 (AT1G68590, L2FCRNA = 1.13), and RPS17 (AT1G79850, L2FCRNA = 1.02), translocons TIC55-II (AT2G24820, L2FCRNA = 1.01), and TIC21 (AT2G15290, L2FCRNA = 1.03), as well as OUTER ENVELOPE PROTEIN 16 (OEP16) (AT2G28900, L2FCRNA = 1.57), PLASTIDIC TYPE I SIGNAL PEPTIDASE 1 (PLSP1) (AT3G24590, L2FCRNA = 1.04), and GRANA-LOCALIZED PROTEIN (RIQ2) (AT1G74730, L2FCRNA = 1.22) may indicate a disruption in plastid physiology in response to microgravity. The transcript-specific alterations in biological functions and localizationsuggests alterations in plastid homeostasis. This phenomenon may, in part, be linked to the reduced negative impact on growth of PhyD-deficient mutants in the spaceflight environment [25]. Identifying the regulatory mechanism responsible for these potentially “wasted” transcripts may provide an ideal target for engineering plants that remain hearty in microgravity. Altered redox state and ROS signaling Reactive oxygen species have emerged as important components of plant signaling, but may also be produced as byproducts of stress metabolism [26]. Transcripts for L-ascorbate oxidase (AT5G21100, L2FCRNA = 1.43), L-ascorbate peroxidase S (AT4G08390, L2FCRNA = 0.96), monodehydroascorbate reductase (AT1G63940, L2FCRNA = 0.98), as well as ascorbate transporters (AT4G00370, L2FCRNA = 0.84; AT2G27810, L2FCRNA = 0.68; AT2G34190, L2FCRNA = 0.82) were all up-regulated in the spaceflight samples. In addition to ascorbate related genes, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH) genes were altered. RBOHB (AT1G09090, L2FCRNA = − 1.38) and RBOHI (AT4G11230, L2FCRNA = − 1.03) (superoxide-producing NADPH oxidases) were down regulated in microgravity. RBOH genes are known mediators of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling [26, 27]. To understand the physiological impact of the altered expression of ROS regulators, we examined the oxidation state of the proteome from our LC-MS/MS results. The insoluble spaceflight samples showed a prevalence of oxidized proteins and decreased oxidation in the soluble samples. Analysis of the membrane protein fraction identified a total of 3659 oxidized peptides, with 174 peptides showing significantly (P ≤ 0.05) altered prevalence between space flown and ground control seedlings. Of those significantly altered, 79% showed a greater prevalence of the oxidized form in space. The trend of increased oxidation may be due in part to the decreased level of several extracellular peroxidase proteins in microgravity. This trend was reversed in the soluble proteins with 88% of the 265 significantly altered peptides showing decreased oxidation in the space-flown seedlings.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Multiple ‘omics approaches yield distinct but comparable results The transcript, protein, and post-translational modification data reported here demonstrate that cellular perturbations caused by microgravity are likely pervasive across all “levels” of regulation. The evidence within these datasets shows that transcription, translation, PTM, and protein turnover are all altered by microgravity (Fig. 4). This global dysregulation suggests that much of the molecular landscape is affected in spaceflight conditions. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Summary of the results and insight provided from the transcript (RNA), protein, and post-translational modification (PTM) datasets. Transcript expression profiles were characterized by RNA-seq and protein expression profiles were characterized and quantified by iTRAQ LC-MS/MS. Expression and fragmentation data characterized the regulatory dynamics induced by adaptation to the spaceflight environment in Arabidopsis thaliana. Gene Ontology analysis identified PTR, PTM, and Degradation candidate genes. DEGs = differentially expressed genes, DAPs = differentially abundant proteins, PTR = post-transcriptional regulationOne striking (but not entirely unexpected) feature of these data is the low correlation between differentially expressed transcripts and differentially abundant proteins (Fig. 3). As the central dogma of biology is most generally reduced to the statement of “DNA to RNA to protein”, the impacts of regulatory mechanisms between transcript and peptide are often forgotten. The resultant differences in the representative mRNA and proteins can be profound, and lack of a correlative relationships, comparable to observations in this experiment, are also observed in a number of studies across model species [28–31]. This misalignment of transcript and peptide data is not a discrepancy, but rather it provides a more comprehensive view of the molecular and regulatory landscape under the chosen treatment conditions. Dysregulation of plastid transcripts Plants grown in microgravity face a variety of challenges including altered gas exchange and the absence of a gravity vector. Plastids play a central role in a plant’s ability to sense and respond to gravity, but also function to store resources collect light energy, and generate cellular signaling components. In this context, it is unsurprising to see a wide variety of plastid-localized and plastid-produced genes differentially regulated in the flight samples (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). However, the presence of several chloroplast-related proteins, specifically those related to photosynthesis, was unexpected. It is not immediately clear how these genes are functioning in this case, as the growth conditions inside the BRIC hardware prevent all light from reaching the plants. It is possible that the stresses of space initiate signaling pathways that induce low levels of chlorophyll production. However, visually the plants appeared to be etiolated (data not shown) so any upregulation of chlorophyll production is small. As these genes appear in the transcriptomic but not the proteomic data set, their expression may indicate a wasteful effort at enhancing light signaling to compensate for the absence of gravity. The absence of any classical directional cue may remove a regulatory feedback that halts the expression of the core plastid components thus resulting in continuous wasteful expression. In either case, understanding the cause of this wasted transcriptional activity could be a ready target for the production of plants optimized for spaceflight applications. This dysregulation may be involved in the improvement to spaceflight adaptation seen in mutants lacking the photosynthetic regulatory component PhyD [25]. Global alterations to redox homeostasis Our results also show alterations in genes and proteins that regulate ROS. Although potentially involved in stress response signaling, they can also be damaging byproducts of stress-induced metabolic signaling [32]. In space, plants responded by increasing the levels of several ROS quenchers such as L-ascorbate oxidase, L-ascorbate peroxidase, and monodehydroascorbate reductase. They also limited production or superoxide-producing RBOH genes. As an overall profile, this makes sense. Microgravity is inherently a stressful environment. Limiting the production of harmful stress byproducts is likely important for plants to cope. Despite this, the data show the activation of ATL9 (a NADH-oxidase dependent expression event) indicating an increased response to ROS. The increased oxidation of the membrane proteome despite the reduced expression of extracellular peroxidases (Table 1) in contrast to the reduced state of the soluble proteome indicates that there exists an increased oxidative extracellular environment and a reduced oxidative potential of the cytosol. ROS has a significant role in modulating the cytoskeletal dynamics of actin [33–35] and microtubules [36]. Thus, stabilization of microtubules in microgravity via decreased phosphorylation of the α-tubulin/β-tubulin interface site of four α-tubulin may represent a ROS-related alteration to cytoskeletal dynamics [23]. This modification and microtubule depolymerization is induced rapidly upon hyperosmotic stress [23]. As with previous spaceflight experiments, response to osmotic stress is enriched among differentially expressed genes, likely due to the absence of the structural guide provided by the constant pull of gravity. Increased microtubule stability has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal structure in the absence of gravity. ROS-induced microtubule dynamics and microtubule-mediated ROS attenuation as seen in hyperosmotic stress responses thus provides a mechanism for a specific compensatory adaptation to space. As microtubules provide the patterning for CESA-mediated cellulose deposition, enhancing the impact of this compensatory adaptation (i.e. microtubule stabilization) could be a highly effective target for enhancing plant growth and biomass generation in the absence of gravity. Cell Wall dynamics and Auxin on the ISS While many plant processes are modulated by auxin, auxin-mediated cellular elongation is the primary effector of differential growth and organ re-orientation [37]. In the absence of gravity (the primary guide of etiolated seedling orientation and growth direction), the plant may default to secondary guiding signals such as touch or micro-gradients in water or nutrients. In this case, the upregulation of PIN, LAX and ABC transporters may represent the plant quickly and transiently responding to many smaller gradients that are no longer overshadowed by gravity. However, auxin is involved in a myriad of cellular processes, so it remains possible that the alterations in auxin-related genes are a byproduct of some other aspect of physiology and not related to gravity or tropisms. The ability of proteomic sequencing to reveal post-translational modifications is a major benefit of the approach. In the case of gravity signaling, the traditional approaches of genetic mutant screens and RNA-seq have failed to identify some of the signaling components of the pathway, suggesting that post-translational modification of potentially redundant proteins, rather than alterations of their levels, may be responsible. We identified post-translational phosphorylation of auxin signaling components. Plasma Membrane Proton H+ ATPase 2 (AHA2) acidifies the cell wall downstream of auxin redistribution [37]. We found the C-terminal domain of AHA-2 to be more phosphorylated in the Earth samples as compared to the space-flown seedlings indicating a reduced activity. Inhibition of AHA2 is also post-translationally regulated in FERONIA-dependent manner [37] which is simultaneously increased in abundance in space doubly indicating a suppression of AHA2 and acid growth of the cell wall. As the plant cell wall evolved in the presence of earth’s gravity, the question of if and how microgravity influences cell wall content has been of interest to researchers for some time. Arabidopsis hypocotyls have lower levels of cellulose when grown in microgravity [20, 21]. However, no cellulose synthase genes (CESA) were observed in the BRIC20 differential transcript or protein datasets (though one CES-like gene was observed in the RNA data). CESA1 was phosphorylated more often in response to microgravity (Table 5). CESA1 is required for primary cell wall biosynthesis, and phosphorylation of CESA proteins negatively modulates their synthetic efficiency [38]. As with AHA2, we observed multiple mechanisms for the inhibition of CESA by the nearly two-fold enhancement of soluble protein SHOU4 [39], which suppresses cellulose synthesis by the regulation of CESA trafficking to the plasma membrane [40].",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions The unified transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of space-flown Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrate the value in employing various ‘omics approaches for data acquisition. The regulatory landscape of the cell is difficult to decipher with transcript data alone, such that the addition of proteomic data provides a more complete picture of plant response to spaceflight and microgravity. Ultimately, we have characterized a significant impact of the spaceflight environment on post-transcriptional regulation, redox homeostasis, plastid gene transcription, and cell wall synthesis. While some of these responses to microgravity have been previously studied or observed, the transcriptomic and proteomic studies unified to produce the most comprehensive understanding of these events to date and provide new direction and strategies for plant engineering. The role of CESA1 and AHA2 along with their potential regulation by SHOU4 and FERONIA, respectively, provide novel insights into the decreased cellulose deposition previously observed in spaceflight [20, 21]. In addition, the interface of redox homeostasis and microtubule dynamics provides a relevant physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment that may result in altered oxidative stress while also enhancing the structural integrity cells in the absence of gravity. Altered regulation of specific elements of cell wall synthesis and microtubule stability, along with the production of plastid transcripts, provide three new targets to engineer plants for optimal growth during long-term spaceflight missions. The sweeping alterations to mRNA turnover, silencing, and splicing, as well as initiation/elongation of protein translation, protein turnover, and other aspects of post-transcriptional regulation may raise more questions than answers and necessitates further study. This regulatory shift indicates that questions regarding spaceflight physiology will not be adequately addressed by transcriptomic studies. Finally, we note that phosphoenriched proteomics remain an unmet need to characterize plant response to microgravity and will provide essential insights into the regulatory mechanisms of plant adaptation to space.",

Copyright notice ID: 7251690 PMID: 32460700 Abstract Background Understanding of gravity sensing and response is critical to long-term human habitation in space and can provide new advantages for terrestrial agriculture. To this end, the altered gene expression profile induced by microgravity has been repeatedly queried by microarray and RNA-seq experiments to understand gravitropism. However, the quantification of altered protein abundance in space has been minimally investigated.Results Proteomic (iTRAQ-labelled LC-MS/MS) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analyses simultaneously quantified protein and transcript differential expression of three-day old, etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown aboard the International Space Station along with their ground control counterparts. Protein extracts were fractionated to isolate soluble and membrane proteins and analyzed to detect differentially phosphorylated peptides. In total, 968 RNAs, 107 soluble proteins, and 103 membrane proteins were identified as differentially expressed. In addition, the proteomic analyses identified 16 differential phosphorylation events. Proteomic data delivered novel insights and simultaneously provided new context to previously made observations of gene expression in microgravity. There is a sweeping shift in post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation including RNA-decapping protein DCP5, the splicing factors GRP7 and GRP8, and AGO4,. These data also indicate AHA2 and FERONIA as well as CESA1 and SHOU4 as central to the cell wall adaptations seen in spaceflight. Patterns of tubulin-α 1, 3,4 and 6 phosphorylation further reveal an interaction of microtubule and redox homeostasis that mirrors osmotic response signaling elements. The absence of gravity also results in a seemingly wasteful dysregulation of plastid gene transcription.Conclusions The datasets gathered from Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to microgravity revealed marked impacts on post-transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics, and plastid gene transcription. The impact of post-transcriptional regulatory alterations represents an unstudied element of the plant microgravity response with the potential to significantly impact plant growth efficiency and beyond. What’s more, addressing the effects of microgravity on AHA2, CESA1, and alpha tubulins has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing biomass production and growth in microgravity. Finally, understanding and manipulating the dysregulation of plastid gene transcription has further potential to address the goal of enhancing plant growth in the stressful conditions of microgravity.Keywords: Gravity, Spaceflight, Arabidopsis, Gravitropism, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Phosphorylation, Post-transcriptional gene regulation, PlastidBackground Plants use external stimuli to adapt to their environment. The most consistent of these stimuli is gravity, the sensing of which allows a plant to properly orient its growth. Since the first plants were sent to space nearly 50 years ago on the NASA Skylab, researchers have utilized the microgravity environment of low Earth orbit to study plant growth, development, and response. Examining plants in microgravity offers insight into the mechanisms of gravity signaling under terrestrial conditions and helps to forge the way toward use of plant cultivation in long-term human space habitation. Early microgravity research examined plant growth and architecture on the whole-plant level. Coupling spaceflight experiments with molecular techniques provides the hope of uncovering some of the elusive molecular pathways driving the gravitropic response. Although costly and complex, new technology has made molecular spaceflight research feasible. Benefits from such studies are two-fold: 1) understanding how plants respond to microgravity may offer insight into optimizing their growth and success in cultivation for beyond-earth food and bioregenerative life support systems, and 2) the possibility of uncovering cryptic signaling components in the gravity response by utilizing the disruption in the gravity stimulus to track molecular changes that reveal the mechanisms behind gravity-related plant growth on Earth. Within the last decade, a handful of spaceflight experiments have produced transcriptomic and proteomic data. Microarray [1–7], RNA-seq [8], and protein mass spec [9–12] experiments have provided snapshots of the molecular environment under microgravity conditions. Because of the low cost and ubiquitous nature of next generation sequencing technology, RNA-seq has become the go-to molecular method for comparing gene expression between multiple samples. It can produce a high-resolution snapshot of gene activation at a given time. However, this approach embraces the implicit assumption that changes to transcript levels correspond to changes in protein abundance. RNA-seq also cannot reveal protein turnover or post-translational modifications. Combining high-resolution transcriptomic techniques such as RNA-seq with proteomics provides a more comprehensive, robust approach to understanding the molecular approach an organism adopts to a new environment than either technique individually. Data presented here were gathered by RNA-seq and protein mass spectrometry providing, for the first time, simultaneous information on transcript abundance, peptide abundance, and changes in post translational modifications (PTMs) in plants grown in the absence of gravity. To gain a more complete view of the molecular environment in microgravity, differentially abundant soluble and membrane proteins were identified via tandem mass spectroscopy with supporting RNA-seq analysis of transcript abundance. Additionally, we were able to track changes in phosphorylation and other PTMs of proteins. Data presented here suggest that the changes induced by microgravity cannot be adequately described by gene expression alone. Analysis of these samples shows that RNA-seq, protein MS, and PTM each tell their own story, contributing intriguing clues to the effects of microgravity at the cellular level. These investigations reveal global perturbations across multiple levels of regulation, novel gravity-responsive PTM events, and a more complete picture of how plants respond to microgravity conditions.Results The BRIC-20 experiment examined the proteomes and transcriptomes of etiolated 3-day old Arabidopsis seedlings grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and identical samples grown on Earth. Arabidopsis seeds were densely planted on 0.5x MS agar plates supplemented with sucrose and germinated on orbit. After 76 h of etiolated growth within the Biological Research in Cannisters (BRIC) hardware, seedlings were fixed with RNAlater and frozen until return to earth. Total protein, divided into soluble and insoluble fractions, and RNA, were extracted from the samples. RNA-seq reads were obtained by Illumina HiSeq 2500. Proteins were ITRAQ-labeled, and discovery proteomics was performed using LC-MS/MS. Total protein levels, as well as PTMs, were compared between flight and ground samples with a decision rule of P ≤ 0.1 to allow for PTM detection in the absence of phosphoenrichment. MS/MS data revealed a subset of phosphorylation events that were significantly (P ≤ 0.1) differentially abundant in space compared to earth. Overall, 968 genes, 107 soluble proteins, and 103 membrane proteins were identified as significantly differentially expressed (P ≤ 0.05) between spaceflight and ground conditions (Fig. 1). At the transcript level, 480 genes were upregulated and 488 genes were downregulated (at a L2FC of ≥ ±1; 2-fold differential expression) in space as compared to on Earth; 45 membrane and 21 soluble proteins were more abundant in space and 58 membrane and 86 soluble proteins were less abundant in space (L2FC of ≥ ± 0.2). In addition to the differentially expressed proteins, we also observed 16 peptides that were differentially phosphorylated in microgravity (P ≤ 0.1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Overview of transcripts (top) and proteins (bottom) differentially expressed during spaceflight. RNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry was performed on space-flown Arabidopsis seedlings and compared to ground controls. The number adjacent to each sector label indicates the count of genes/proteins that occupy the slice. Subcellular localizations are shown in the outermost circles. SUBA4 [13] (V.4.6.0, accessed June 2017) was used to identify the subcellular localizations. Gene/protein accessions and expression values are provided in Supplemental File 1The subcellular localization of the differential proteins and the proteins encoded by the differentially expressed transcripts was assessed using SUBA4 [13]. One of the most overt differences in cellular localization was the > 25% of transcripts upregulated in spaceflight being localized to the plastid compared to < 1% of the transcripts upregulated on Earth (Fig. 1). This change was not reflected in the protein data and provides a primary indication of dysregulation of plastid genes in the absence of gravity despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of chloroplast development in etiolated seedlings. Extracellular localization was only observed in the soluble proteins downregulated in space, with 8 extracellular localized proteins. These proteins are primarily regulators of oxidation and cell wall dynamics (Table 1). Table 1.

In an effort to identify trends in altered physiological function, four discrete groupings of molecular data were analyzed: 1) proteins that were in more abundance in spaceflight samples; 2) proteins more abundant on Earth, 3) transcripts more abundant in the spaceflight samples, and 4) transcripts more abundant on Earth (Fig. 2). Four key features of transcriptomic and proteomic datasets reveal novel physiological adaptations in spaceflight and simultaneously demonstrate the utility of this mixed ‘omics approach. First, genes regulating cell wall organization processes are enriched among upregulated proteins and downregulated transcripts. The differential phosphorylation, protein, and gene expression data all reveal specific aspects of a nuanced regulatory shift in cell-wall related processes as a part of the change associated with microgravity. Second, redox homeostasis and a broad set of GO terms related to reactive oxygen species production and metabolism are enriched among the up and down regulated transcripts but not mirrored in the differentially expressed proteins. A third intriguing feature is the upregulation of plastid-localized gene transcription despite the seedlings being etiolated (as the hardware allows no light to enter). Finally, there is a pervasive shift in the regulation of translation and post-transcriptional regulation as a whole that is solely enriched at the protein level. Fig. 2.

The central callouts list the differentially expressed genes/proteins within the selected GO term. Enrichment was performed for GO terms for biological processes using Orange (V.3.7.0, GO terms were accessed July 2017). Only transcripts with a log-fold change ±1 (FDR ≤ 0.05) or proteins with a log-fold change ±0.2 (P ≤ 0.05) were included in the analysis. The upregulated and downregulated genes were run separately, and the resultant GO enrichments were thinned to include GO terms with a p-value ≤0.05 using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Numbers next to the terms represent the number of genes or proteins that appeared in that term, followed by the total number genes or proteins associated with that term. Supporting data can be found in Supplemental File 2Post-transcriptional gene regulation, alternative splicing, and post-translational modifications To determine if any of the proteins identified were altered independent of transcript levels, we compared the lists of significantly altered transcripts (P ≤ 0.05; L2FC of ≥1) and the list of significantly altered proteins (P ≤ 0.05; L2FC of ≥0.2). Of the genes and proteins showing differential expression/abundance as a result of spaceflight, only 17 appeared in both the RNA and protein datasets (Fig. 3, Table 2) representing 2 and 8% of mRNAs and proteins, respectively. Of the 17 in this group, 12 showed consistent direction of expression (i.e. both increased or both decreased). The remaining five showed expression in opposing directions between the transcript and protein. Hypergeometric distribution analysis indicated a significant (p = 0.036) correlation between these gene sets when considering only the genes that show consistent direction of expression, and a more dramatic correlation when including all 17 overlapping genes (p = 9.7 e− 4). A cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (dPGM, AT5G04120) predicted to be involved in glycolysis was upregulated in both datasets in response to spaceflight [14]. Given the etiolated seedlings were grown on sucrose media, this shift in a regulatory component of glycolysis may be representative of an important metabolic target for spaceflight adaptation. Inversely, AT1G19530—an epsilon catalytic subunit A of DNA polymerase—was consistently downregulated in proteomic and transcriptomic analyses (Fig. 3). Notably, a probable aquaporin protein belonging to the tonoplast intrinsic protein family (TIP3.2) was significantly more abundant in space despite TIP3.2 transcripts being more than four-fold downregulated. Of the 17 genes and proteins coordinately differentially expressed, nearly 30% of these genes show opposite directions of differential expression like TIP3.2. Thus, post-transcriptional gene regulation may have important implications for adjustment to spaceflight. Fig. 3.

Transcript and protein levels for many ribosomal subunits were altered between Earth and microgravity, which may have an impact on the translational dynamics of the cell. Twelve transcripts for ribosomal proteins were differentially expressed, with only one, a structural component, downregulated nearly 8-fold in space (Table 3). The remaining 11 were upregulated in the spaceflight samples. Medina [15] suggested that changes in ribosome biosynthesis as a result of microgravity caused an uncoupling of cellular growth and cellular proliferation [15]. The differential expression of various tRNAs and the increased abundance of proteins related to post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and translational initiation (enriched in proteins upregulated and downregulated in spaceflight, respectively) suggest an even more substantial impact on regulatory dynamics induced by spaceflight (Fig. 2; Supplemental File 2). The increased protein expression of RNA DECAPPING PROTEIN 5 (DCP5, AT1G26110, L2FCmembrane = 0.32) and the RNA-silencing protein ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4, AT2G27040, L2FCsoluble = 0.44, L2FCRNA = 0.78) further indicate an increased mRNA turnover and siRNA-mediated gene silencing while coping with microgravity. Perhaps the most novel finding relating to this regulatory shift is found in the PTM data. EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR ISOFORM 4G-1, GTP BINDING ELONGATION FACTOR TU FAMILY, ELONGATION FACTOR 1-DELTA 1, and a Trigger Factor Type Chaperone family protein all had differential levels of phosphorylation (Table 4) suggesting an additional mechanism for regulating translation. Among these phosphorylation events, we also see evidence for differential splicing as an adaptation to spaceflight. The RNA-binding proteins GRP7 and GRP8, both regulators of alternative splicing [16], were preferentially phosphorylated on Earth at the S118 residue in response to microgravity (L2FCphospho = − 0.39 and − 0.54, respectively) (Table 5). This suggests an alteration in splicing patterns within the plant in response to spaceflight. A splice aware analysis of transcripts identified 24 genes with at least two transcripts differentially expressed (Fig. S1). VILLIN 1, PEROXIN 11E, NATURAL RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED MACROPHAGE PROTEIN 1 isoforms that are inversely differentially expressed by spaceflight. For example, the actin binding protein VILLIN 1 isoforms AT2G29890.2 (L2FCRNA > 5) and AT2G29890.3 (L2FCRNA < − 7.5) approach complete silencing in space and on earth respectively (Additional file 3: Fig. S1). The altered ratio of gene isoforms confirms that transcripts are subject to altered processing in microgravity. Table 3.

Three E3 ligase mRNAs were altered by a L2FC of ≥ ±1 including ARABIDOPSIS TOXICOS EN LEVADURA 9 (ATL9, AT2G35000, L2FCRNA = − 1.1), BOI-RELATED GENE 2 (BRG2, AT1G79110, L2FCRNA = 1.9), and RING-H2 FINGER PROTEIN 2B (RHA2B, AT2G01150, L2FCRNA = 1.0). ATL9, expressed in an NADPH-dependent matter, has been implicated in pathogen response due to its chitin-mediated expression, but is not upregulated in response to the canonical defense hormones [17]. BRG2 is a member of a subclass of RING-type E3 ligases which contribute Botrytis cinerea resistance and mediate stress and pathogen responses [18]. Finally, the E3 ligase RHA2B has an additive effect with its closest homolog, RHA2A, in regulating ABA and drought response [19]. In addition to the standard E3 ligases, five members of the F-box superfamily, PHLOEM PROTEIN 2-A13 (PP2-A13, AT3G61060, L2FCRNA = − 2.0), AT3G27150 (L2FCRNA = − 1.7), PHLOEM PROTEIN 2-A14 (PP2-A14, AT5G52120, L2FCRNA = 1.5), and AT1G23390 (L2FCRNA = − 1.3) were differentially expressed. Other components of the regulated proteolysis pathway were also altered. REGULATORY PARTICLE AAA-ATPASE 2A (RPT2a, L2FCSoluble = − 0.32) and a 26S proteasome regulatory subunit (RPN7, AT4G24820, L2FCSoluble = − 0.76) were both downregulated in spaceflight samples. NUCLEAR ENCODED CLP PROTEASE 5 (CLPP5, L2FCSoluble = 0.56), SIGNAL PEPTIDE PEPTIDASE (SPPA, L2FCMembrane = 0.21), and the peptidase SHOU4 (AT1G78880, L2FCMembrane = 0.81) were all upregulated in space. An additional 23 proteases were altered at the transcript level (Additional file 1). Overall, microgravity-grown plants appear to display changes in the capacity to produce, regulate, and degrade proteins.Cell Wall synthesis in the spaceflight environment Microgravity has been shown to have a significant impact on plant growth [20, 21]. In these datasets, the most obviously impact is seen in differential expression and regulation of components of cell wall modification. At the protein level, a number of UDP-D-Xylose synthases, transferases, and hydrolases (XT2, GUT1, XS1,XS2, XTH19) were upregulated in microgravity, along with a putative plasmodesmata localized BETA-1,3-GLUCANASE (BG_PPAP, AT5G42100). Quantitative tracking of PTMs has revealed several novel aspects of spaceflight acclimation in plants, including alterations in cell wall synthesis (Table 5). PLASMA MEMBRANE PROTON ATPASE 2 (AHA2) was differentially phosphorylated between flight and ground controls. AHA2 has been implicated as the link between auxin and acid growth. The redistribution of auxin in response to tropic stimulus initiates transcription of SAUR19, which in turn inhibits a PP2C-D phosphatase allowing for AHA2-mediated acidification of the cell wall and subsequent cellular elongation [22]. The phosphorylated form of AHA2 was more abundant on Earth (L2FCphospho = − 0.36) (Table 5). Components involved in cellulose deposition also showed altered transcription. CELLULOSE SYNTHASE 1(CESA1) phosphorylation was increased in spaceflight samples (L2FCphospho = 0.23) (Table 3) while, Tubulin-α 1, 3,4 and 6, required for cellulose patterning, were preferentially phosphorylated on Earth (L2FCphospho = − 0.24, − 0.26, − 0.24 and − 0.24 respectively) (Table 5) at T349; phosphorylation at T349 is known to encourage microtubule depolymerization [23]. While many plant processes are modulated by auxin, auxin-mediated asymmetric cellular elongation is the primary effector of directional growth responses, including gravitropism, and is an essential component in the regulation of cell wall growth and elongation. Many of the auxin-related pathways are clearly perturbed in response to microgravity, with representatives from many aspects of auxin signaling and response appearing in either the protein or the gene expression dataset. Both of the enzymes in the primary synthesis pathway from tryptophan to IAA are represented. The first, L-tryptophan-pyruvate-aminotransferase 1 (L2FCRNA = 0.82), is upregulated nearly two-fold. The transcript for the second enzyme, indole-3-pyruvate-monooxegenase (YUCCA6, L2FCRNA = -0.86), was downregulated nearly two-fold in spaceflight samples. This expression pattern could result in an increased level of Indole-3-pyruvate —the final precursor in auxin synthesis—along with a decrease in conversion of Indole-3-pyruvate to IAA (primary active form of auxin) because of the decreased level of YUCCA6. Several of the genes responsible for auxin redistribution were also present in the datasets. Five auxin carriers were differentially expressed in total: PIN2 (AT5G57090, L2FCRNA = -0.77), PIN-like7 (AT5G65980, L2FCRNA = -0.95), and ABCB15 (AT3G28345, L2FCRNA = -0.87) were down-regulated in space, while PIN-FORMED 4 (PIN4, AT2G01420, L2FCRNA = 0.77) and LAX2 (AT2G21050, L2FCRNA = 0.87) were up-regulated, suggesting that space-grown plants are altering their auxin distribution in response to the space-flight environment. In addition to auxin biosynthesis and transport, auxin perception and response were also perturbed. AUXIN SIGNALING F BOX PROTEIN 1 (AFB1, AT4G03190, L2FCmembrane = − 0.11), a member of the TIR1 family, was less abundant in microgravity in the protein dataset. Auxin-responsive proteins IAA5 (L2FCRNA = 2.83) and IAA28 (L2FCRNA = -0.84) genes were found to be differentially expressed, as well as Auxin-response factors ARF4 (L2FCRNA = 0.81) and ARF11 (L2FCRNA = 0.72). Two small auxin-upregulated RNA (SAUR) genes (both downregulated) and five SAUR-like genes (3 downregulate, 2 upregulated) were differentially expressed in microgravity. These have been shown to be auxin-responsive regulators of adaptive growth, and may be responsible for modulating new growth patterns in the absence of gravity [24]. Whether auxin is the predominant regulator of cell wall related adaptions remains to be seen, however, the characterization provided by transcript, protein and PTM data provides an enhanced understanding of cell wall regulatory dynamics—a primary target for optimization of plant growth in space.Influences on plastid function and regulation Genes and terms relating to plastid function were among the most pronounced features of the subcellular localization (Fig. 1) and the gene ontology enrichment analysis (Fig. 2). Notably, the enrichment of genes associated with chlorophyll biosynthetic process, protein import into chloroplast stroma, plastid membrane organization, protein targeting to chloroplast, and chloroplast organization were seen in the transcript dataset (Fig. 2; Additional file 2). These results were unexpected because seedlings were sealed inside PDFU’s, which were then sealed inside the BRIC. This environment provides no light to initiate chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast development Although plastids play an important role in gravity perception through the sedimentation of dense amyloplasts in the root cap and shoot endodermis, many of the differentially expressed genes (e.g. chlorophyll synthase) relate to photosynthesis, rather than amyloplast-related functions. This may suggest a microgravity-induced disruption in plastid operation that goes beyond gravity perception and may impact metabolic-based plastid processes. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis for the transcript data revealed significant enrichment in terms such as plastid translation, protein import into the stroma, targeting to chloroplast, and plastid organization (Fig. 2; Supplemental File 2). The increased transcript expression of plastid ribosomal proteins SVR8 (AT5G54600, L2FCRNA = 1.01), PSRP3/1 (AT1G68590, L2FCRNA = 1.13), and RPS17 (AT1G79850, L2FCRNA = 1.02), translocons TIC55-II (AT2G24820, L2FCRNA = 1.01), and TIC21 (AT2G15290, L2FCRNA = 1.03), as well as OUTER ENVELOPE PROTEIN 16 (OEP16) (AT2G28900, L2FCRNA = 1.57), PLASTIDIC TYPE I SIGNAL PEPTIDASE 1 (PLSP1) (AT3G24590, L2FCRNA = 1.04), and GRANA-LOCALIZED PROTEIN (RIQ2) (AT1G74730, L2FCRNA = 1.22) may indicate a disruption in plastid physiology in response to microgravity. The transcript-specific alterations in biological functions and localizationsuggests alterations in plastid homeostasis. This phenomenon may, in part, be linked to the reduced negative impact on growth of PhyD-deficient mutants in the spaceflight environment [25]. Identifying the regulatory mechanism responsible for these potentially “wasted” transcripts may provide an ideal target for engineering plants that remain hearty in microgravity.Altered redox state and ROS signaling Reactive oxygen species have emerged as important components of plant signaling, but may also be produced as byproducts of stress metabolism [26]. Transcripts for L-ascorbate oxidase (AT5G21100, L2FCRNA = 1.43), L-ascorbate peroxidase S (AT4G08390, L2FCRNA = 0.96), monodehydroascorbate reductase (AT1G63940, L2FCRNA = 0.98), as well as ascorbate transporters (AT4G00370, L2FCRNA = 0.84; AT2G27810, L2FCRNA = 0.68; AT2G34190, L2FCRNA = 0.82) were all up-regulated in the spaceflight samples. In addition to ascorbate related genes, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH) genes were altered. RBOHB (AT1G09090, L2FCRNA = − 1.38) and RBOHI (AT4G11230, L2FCRNA = − 1.03) (superoxide-producing NADPH oxidases) were down regulated in microgravity. RBOH genes are known mediators of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling [26, 27]. To understand the physiological impact of the altered expression of ROS regulators, we examined the oxidation state of the proteome from our LC-MS/MS results. The insoluble spaceflight samples showed a prevalence of oxidized proteins and decreased oxidation in the soluble samples. Analysis of the membrane protein fraction identified a total of 3659 oxidized peptides, with 174 peptides showing significantly (P ≤ 0.05) altered prevalence between space flown and ground control seedlings. Of those significantly altered, 79% showed a greater prevalence of the oxidized form in space. The trend of increased oxidation may be due in part to the decreased level of several extracellular peroxidase proteins in microgravity. This trend was reversed in the soluble proteins with 88% of the 265 significantly altered peptides showing decreased oxidation in the space-flown seedlings.Discussion Multiple ‘omics approaches yield distinct but comparable results The transcript, protein, and post-translational modification data reported here demonstrate that cellular perturbations caused by microgravity are likely pervasive across all “levels” of regulation. The evidence within these datasets shows that transcription, translation, PTM, and protein turnover are all altered by microgravity (Fig. 4). This global dysregulation suggests that much of the molecular landscape is affected in spaceflight conditions. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Summary of the results and insight provided from the transcript (RNA), protein, and post-translational modification (PTM) datasets. Transcript expression profiles were characterized by RNA-seq and protein expression profiles were characterized and quantified by iTRAQ LC-MS/MS. Expression and fragmentation data characterized the regulatory dynamics induced by adaptation to the spaceflight environment in Arabidopsis thaliana. Gene Ontology analysis identified PTR, PTM, and Degradation candidate genes. DEGs = differentially expressed genes, DAPs = differentially abundant proteins, PTR = post-transcriptional regulationOne striking (but not entirely unexpected) feature of these data is the low correlation between differentially expressed transcripts and differentially abundant proteins (Fig. 3). As the central dogma of biology is most generally reduced to the statement of “DNA to RNA to protein”, the impacts of regulatory mechanisms between transcript and peptide are often forgotten. The resultant differences in the representative mRNA and proteins can be profound, and lack of a correlative relationships, comparable to observations in this experiment, are also observed in a number of studies across model species [28–31]. This misalignment of transcript and peptide data is not a discrepancy, but rather it provides a more comprehensive view of the molecular and regulatory landscape under the chosen treatment conditions.Dysregulation of plastid transcripts Plants grown in microgravity face a variety of challenges including altered gas exchange and the absence of a gravity vector. Plastids play a central role in a plant’s ability to sense and respond to gravity, but also function to store resources collect light energy, and generate cellular signaling components. In this context, it is unsurprising to see a wide variety of plastid-localized and plastid-produced genes differentially regulated in the flight samples (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). However, the presence of several chloroplast-related proteins, specifically those related to photosynthesis, was unexpected. It is not immediately clear how these genes are functioning in this case, as the growth conditions inside the BRIC hardware prevent all light from reaching the plants. It is possible that the stresses of space initiate signaling pathways that induce low levels of chlorophyll production. However, visually the plants appeared to be etiolated (data not shown) so any upregulation of chlorophyll production is small. As these genes appear in the transcriptomic but not the proteomic data set, their expression may indicate a wasteful effort at enhancing light signaling to compensate for the absence of gravity. The absence of any classical directional cue may remove a regulatory feedback that halts the expression of the core plastid components thus resulting in continuous wasteful expression. In either case, understanding the cause of this wasted transcriptional activity could be a ready target for the production of plants optimized for spaceflight applications. This dysregulation may be involved in the improvement to spaceflight adaptation seen in mutants lacking the photosynthetic regulatory component PhyD [25].Global alterations to redox homeostasis Our results also show alterations in genes and proteins that regulate ROS. Although potentially involved in stress response signaling, they can also be damaging byproducts of stress-induced metabolic signaling [32]. In space, plants responded by increasing the levels of several ROS quenchers such as L-ascorbate oxidase, L-ascorbate peroxidase, and monodehydroascorbate reductase. They also limited production or superoxide-producing RBOH genes. As an overall profile, this makes sense. Microgravity is inherently a stressful environment. Limiting the production of harmful stress byproducts is likely important for plants to cope. Despite this, the data show the activation of ATL9 (a NADH-oxidase dependent expression event) indicating an increased response to ROS. The increased oxidation of the membrane proteome despite the reduced expression of extracellular peroxidases (Table 1) in contrast to the reduced state of the soluble proteome indicates that there exists an increased oxidative extracellular environment and a reduced oxidative potential of the cytosol. ROS has a significant role in modulating the cytoskeletal dynamics of actin [33–35] and microtubules [36]. Thus, stabilization of microtubules in microgravity via decreased phosphorylation of the α-tubulin/β-tubulin interface site of four α-tubulin may represent a ROS-related alteration to cytoskeletal dynamics [23]. This modification and microtubule depolymerization is induced rapidly upon hyperosmotic stress [23]. As with previous spaceflight experiments, response to osmotic stress is enriched among differentially expressed genes, likely due to the absence of the structural guide provided by the constant pull of gravity. Increased microtubule stability has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal structure in the absence of gravity. ROS-induced microtubule dynamics and microtubule-mediated ROS attenuation as seen in hyperosmotic stress responses thus provides a mechanism for a specific compensatory adaptation to space. As microtubules provide the patterning for CESA-mediated cellulose deposition, enhancing the impact of this compensatory adaptation (i.e. microtubule stabilization) could be a highly effective target for enhancing plant growth and biomass generation in the absence of gravity.Cell Wall dynamics and Auxin on the ISS While many plant processes are modulated by auxin, auxin-mediated cellular elongation is the primary effector of differential growth and organ re-orientation [37]. In the absence of gravity (the primary guide of etiolated seedling orientation and growth direction), the plant may default to secondary guiding signals such as touch or micro-gradients in water or nutrients. In this case, the upregulation of PIN, LAX and ABC transporters may represent the plant quickly and transiently responding to many smaller gradients that are no longer overshadowed by gravity. However, auxin is involved in a myriad of cellular processes, so it remains possible that the alterations in auxin-related genes are a byproduct of some other aspect of physiology and not related to gravity or tropisms. The ability of proteomic sequencing to reveal post-translational modifications is a major benefit of the approach. In the case of gravity signaling, the traditional approaches of genetic mutant screens and RNA-seq have failed to identify some of the signaling components of the pathway, suggesting that post-translational modification of potentially redundant proteins, rather than alterations of their levels, may be responsible. We identified post-translational phosphorylation of auxin signaling components. Plasma Membrane Proton H+ ATPase 2 (AHA2) acidifies the cell wall downstream of auxin redistribution [37]. We found the C-terminal domain of AHA-2 to be more phosphorylated in the Earth samples as compared to the space-flown seedlings indicating a reduced activity. Inhibition of AHA2 is also post-translationally regulated in FERONIA-dependent manner [37] which is simultaneously increased in abundance in space doubly indicating a suppression of AHA2 and acid growth of the cell wall. As the plant cell wall evolved in the presence of earth’s gravity, the question of if and how microgravity influences cell wall content has been of interest to researchers for some time. Arabidopsis hypocotyls have lower levels of cellulose when grown in microgravity [20, 21]. However, no cellulose synthase genes (CESA) were observed in the BRIC20 differential transcript or protein datasets (though one CES-like gene was observed in the RNA data). CESA1 was phosphorylated more often in response to microgravity (Table 5). CESA1 is required for primary cell wall biosynthesis, and phosphorylation of CESA proteins negatively modulates their synthetic efficiency [38]. As with AHA2, we observed multiple mechanisms for the inhibition of CESA by the nearly two-fold enhancement of soluble protein SHOU4 [39], which suppresses cellulose synthesis by the regulation of CESA trafficking to the plasma membrane [40].Conclusions The unified transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of space-flown Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrate the value in employing various ‘omics approaches for data acquisition. The regulatory landscape of the cell is difficult to decipher with transcript data alone, such that the addition of proteomic data provides a more complete picture of plant response to spaceflight and microgravity. Ultimately, we have characterized a significant impact of the spaceflight environment on post-transcriptional regulation, redox homeostasis, plastid gene transcription, and cell wall synthesis. While some of these responses to microgravity have been previously studied or observed, the transcriptomic and proteomic studies unified to produce the most comprehensive understanding of these events to date and provide new direction and strategies for plant engineering. The role of CESA1 and AHA2 along with their potential regulation by SHOU4 and FERONIA, respectively, provide novel insights into the decreased cellulose deposition previously observed in spaceflight [20, 21]. In addition, the interface of redox homeostasis and microtubule dynamics provides a relevant physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment that may result in altered oxidative stress while also enhancing the structural integrity cells in the absence of gravity. Altered regulation of specific elements of cell wall synthesis and microtubule stability, along with the production of plastid transcripts, provide three new targets to engineer plants for optimal growth during long-term spaceflight missions. The sweeping alterations to mRNA turnover, silencing, and splicing, as well as initiation/elongation of protein translation, protein turnover, and other aspects of post-transcriptional regulation may raise more questions than answers and necessitates further study. This regulatory shift indicates that questions regarding spaceflight physiology will not be adequately addressed by transcriptomic studies. Finally, we note that phosphoenriched proteomics remain an unmet need to characterize plant response to microgravity and will provide essential insights into the regulatory mechanisms of plant adaptation to space.Methods Plant material Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyn. var. Columbia (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Stock ID: CS22625), were used for all experiments. Aliquots of 0.016 ± 0.002 g of seeds (approximately 800–900 seeds per plate) were surface sterilized with 30% (v/v) bleach and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 for 2 min, washed with sterile water (5x), then dried onto 60 mm round filter paper to facilitate plating. Seeds were spread onto 60 mm round Petri plates containing 0.5 X Murashige and Skoog (MS) media (Caisson, Smithfield, UT) with 1% sucrose and 1% agar, cold stratified overnight, and provided a 1 h white light treatment to facilitate consistent germination.Spaceflight parameters Twenty-two seeded plates were then individually integrated into Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs), and RNALater (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA) was loaded into the liquid reservoir. PDFUs were then tested for leaks and loaded into Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware for flight: five plates plus a HOBO data logger in two BRICs and six plates in the remaining two BRICs. All BRICs were put into cold stowage (4 °C) prior to launch. The experiment was launched aboard Space-X 5 on January 10, 2015. Upon docking of the Dragon capsule to the International Space Station (ISS), the BRICs were removed from cold stowage and placed at ambient temperature (ca. 21 °C). After 76 h, the PDFUs were actuated releasing RNAlater into the Petri dish for seedling fixation. Samples were incubated at ambient temperature in RNAlater for 12 h then placed at − 80 °C in the MELFI freezer aboard ISS. Twenty-two additional plates were integrated into hardware as ground controls and maintained under identical growth conditions and processing on a 48 h delay. These were held at Kennedy Space Center with environmental conditions aboard ISS provided via downlink. After the spaceflight samples returned from ISS, both spaceflight and ground control plates were removed from the hardware while frozen and packed in dry ice at Kennedy Space Center, then transported to Ohio University in a temperature-controlled vehicle. In addition to the Kennedy Ground control, two additional controls were set up to check if the spaceflight hardware or the preservative RNAlater were causing any significant changes in the transcriptome and proteome of Arabidopsis seedlings. Details of the hardware and preservative studies have been published in Basu et al. [41] and Kruse et al. [42], respectively. All pertinent datasets are publicly available on the NASA GeneLab repository.RNA extraction and processing RNA was extracted according to Kruse et al. [39, 41]. In brief, three biological replicates, one plate per replicate, were used for RNA-seq analysis. RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Plant Mini Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to standard protocols. RNA integrity (RIN ≥ 8) was verified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA samples were sent to the Genome Technology Access Center in the Department of Genetics at Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO. Paired-end sequence was obtained from an Illumina 2500 Hiseq (2 X 101 bp) using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit prior to library preparation. Read pairs for each biological replicate were aligned to TAIR10 [43, 44] assembly using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) [45]. Gene level read counts were determined using HTSeq-count. For transcript/isoform analysis, Sailfish (v0.9.0) was used for splice aware transcript quantification [46]. Differential expression was determined using the generalized linear model likelihood test within the Empirical Analysis of Digital Gene Expression Data in R (EdgeR) package [47, 48].Protein extraction and data analysis Soluble and membrane proteins were extracted and processed according to Basu et al. [40]. In brief, seedlings from five plates, were pooled for each of the 3 replicates. Seedlings were crushed in liquid nitrogen and vortexed thoroughly in extraction buffer. Sample were then centrifuged at 100,000 g to isolate the membrane proteins. The supernatant was saved and used for the extraction of soluble proteins. Samples were sent to the Proteomics & Mass Spectrometry Facility at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (St. Louis, MO) for processing, iTRAQ labeling, and tandem mass spectrometry of protein samples as detailed in [49, 50]. Briefly, protein concentration of each replicate was estimated using CBX assay. Equal amounts (40 μg) of both membrane and soluble, three replicates each, were digested with trypsin and labeled with a unique iTRAQ 8plex (AB SCIEX, Massachusetts, USA). The labeled replicates were pooled and fractionated using high pH reverse phase chromatography [40, 51]. The fractions were combined into 12 final fractions for LC-MS/MS using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Mass spectrometry data analyses were automated using Mascot Daemon 2.5 (Matrix Science, London, UK). The TAIR10 database was used as a reference (including target and decoy sequences, 35,386 entries) assuming trypsin digestion. To identify post-translational modifications using Mascot, the modifications due to iTRAQ 8-plex labeling of lysine and the N-terminus of the peptides and carbamidomethyl of cysteine were specified as fixed modifications. The variable modifications were specified as deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine, and phosphorylation of serine/threonine and tyrosine. Only proteins with at least two peptides with score > 20 were reported. A Student’s t-test was used to determine significant difference between protein expression in spaceflight and ground control conditions. In accordance with previous studies demonstrating smaller but impactful variations in protein abundance, proteins with a p-value ≤0.05 and a log fold change greater than 0.2 or less than − 0.2 were considered significantly different between experimental and control samples [49, 51]. Individual peptides containing post-translational modifications were examined evaluated using a Student’s t-test to determine phosphorylation events that were altered by spaceflight conditions. A hypergeometric distribution test was used to determine if overlap between proteomic and transcriptomic candidates was non-random. The hypergeometric P-value was calculated using p = (kCx) ((n-k)C(n-x)) /NCn, where N is the number of genes in the genome (estimated at 27,000 for this work), k is the number of genes identified by RNAseq, n is the number of genes identified by proteomics, x is the number of overlapping candidates, and kCx is the number of possible gene combinations.Exclusions based on control experiments In addition to the ground control at Kennedy Space Center, two additional analyses were run to provide insight into whether the spaceflight hardware [41] or the preservative RNAlater [42] caused significant changes in the transcriptome and proteome of Arabidopsis seedlings. Comparing differentially expressed genes and proteins from these additional control studies with those from the spaceflight/ground control analysis revealed 263 genes and 159 proteins significantly affected by both hardware and spaceflight while 249 genes and 152 proteins were affected both by RNAlater and spaceflight. Rather than excluding all genes found in these secondary controls, a logical decision rule (Eq. 1) was developed to identify genes which were more or differently perturbed by spaceflight than either control study. All genes and proteins that passed the decision rule were considered differentially expressed despite their altered expression in a control study. The decision rule, RangeLFCcontrolLFCSF>LFCcontrolorLFCSF>LFCcontrol 1 where LFCcontrol is the log2 fold change of a gene in the control study where it showed significant differential expression and LFCSF is the log2 fold change of a gene in the spaceflight/ground control experiment, allows genes to be retained if the impact of spaceflight was different than the effect of either the preservative or hardware control.Subcellular analyses Differentially expressed transcripts and proteins were analyzed using SUBA4 [13] (V.4.6.0, accessed June 2017) to identify the subcellular localization of differentially expressed genes. Only transcripts with a log-fold change ±1 (FDR ≤ 0.05) or proteins with a log-fold change ±0.2 (P ≤ 0.05) were included in the analysis. Multi-level pie charts were rendered to identify the distribution of localization among subsets of genes.Gene ontology enrichment analyses Gene Ontology (GO) enrichments were performed for Biological Processes using Python based tool, Orange [52] (V.3.7.0, GO terms accessed June 2017). Only transcripts with a log-fold change ±1 (FDR ≤ 0.05) or proteins with a log-fold change ±0.2 (P ≤ 0.05) were included in the analysis. The upregulated and downregulated genes were run separately, and the resultant GO enrichments were thinned to include GO terms with a p-value ≤0.05 using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons that had at least 4 and no more than 750 reference genes within the term (to exclude poorly annotated terms and overly broad terms, respectively) and that had more than one differentially expressed gene within the experimental dataset. Of the remaining GO terms, only the two terms with minimal distance from biological process within each branch were included. When redundant terms (terms containing identical gene sets and with similar naming) were found, only the most informative GO term was retained. A visual representation of the resulting enrichments was created by analyzing enrichment of associated GO terms and creating a heat map. The heat map was generated using the R packages “RColorBrewer” and “gplots.”Supplementary information Additional file 1. (254.7KB, xlsx) Additional file 2. (77.3KB, xlsx) Additional file 3.

The journey beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) will expand human civilization, enable future space settlements, provide scientific knowledge of the evolution of our planet and the solar system, and create global partnerships in the quest for further space exploration1,2. Under the Artemis plan, a crewed lunar flyby is scheduled for 2024 (Artemis II), followed by a lunar landing in 2025 (Artemis III)—the first since the end of the Apollo era in 1972, and eventually a sustainable lunar presence by the end of this decade3. Critical to the success of the Artemis program will be Gateway, an orbiting platform where astronauts will live and conduct research, while providing support for lengthy expeditions on the lunar surface. The Artemis program will establish a base camp at the lunar south pole that will serve as a steppingstone for human missions to Mars. Research and development at the lunar base will act as prototypes for these future Mars missions, where NASA can establish best practices for long-term human exploration in these adverse extraterrestrial environments4. Unlike the operation of the International Space Station (ISS), which is regularly resupplied from Earth within hours after launch, deep space missions will require self-sufficiency and sustainability independent of Earth. This will involve utilization of renewable resources, recycling of waste, power generation, and a continuous supply of food, water, and oxygen over a prolonged/indefinite period. The moon is the shortest distance beyond LEO with a deep space environment offering unique research opportunities to be conducted under the Artemis program. The lunar orbiter Gateway will function similarly to the ISS utilizing a Power and Propulsion Element that will use solar energy to propel and power the spacecraft, a Habitation and Logistics Outpost that will serve as the living quarters and research workspace, and docking ports for spacecraft such as Orion, that will be the first of its kind to transport astronauts to and from deep space5,6. The ISS and Earth-orbiting satellites capitalize on solar energy as a renewable resource for power, however in more distant outposts such as Mars, other factors like distance from the sun, angle, and weather (i.e., dust storms) affect the efficiency of energy provided by the solar arrays7. Such was the case with NASA’s Insight mission, where a recent Martian dust storm led to accumulated dust on the solar panels preventing adequate sunlight from reaching them, forcing the lander into battery-conserving “safe mode”8. Similar dust coverage issues were experienced during Apollo missions due to electrically charged lunar dust adhering to solar panels on the lunar lander9,10. Resupply cargo, like those that are frequently sent to the ISS, is costly, and may not be feasible for long-duration space missions (it takes ~7 months to get to Mars). Thus, self-sustainability in food and oxygen production on extraterrestrial outposts, such as on the Moon and Mars, is crucial11. In addition, communication delays between Earth and Mars can range from 5 to 20 min depending on the position of the planets12. Lack of cargo resupply missions and communication delays can be detrimental to human health-related emergencies making it imperative for crew members to be self-sufficient in health risk prevention and treatment. Therefore, solutions to address limited resources and human health risks that can be feasibly implemented in deep space must be established prior to the Artemis and Mars exploration missions.

This self-sufficiency can be achieved by implementing bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS). BLSS generate essential resources for human survival through biological processes, with four main purposes: higher plant cultivation, water treatment, solid waste bioconversion, and atmosphere revitalization. Microbes play a vital role in these biological processes by reducing the storage and resupply of materials necessary for a life-sustaining, regenerative environment. Research on BLSS dates back to as early as the 1960s, by researchers worldwide. Examples include NASA’s “BioHome,” a 650 sq ft closed system that utilized a wetland system for wastewater recycling, and a biological system including plants and microorganisms for reducing organic contamination from wastewater29; the Soviet space program’s Biosphere 3 (BIOS-3), an underground closed system of phytotrons, that consists of a crew area and an entirely enclosed greenhouse, growing wheat and vegetables as well as algae cultivators for air revitalization30; the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative (MELiSSA), which includes five compartments where plants and microorganisms purify the air, produce food, and recycle waste31; and Beighan University’s Lunar Permanent Astrobase Life-support Artificial Closed Ecosystem (Palace) 1, comprising three cabins that work simultaneously to manage atmospheric conditions, produce crops, breed insects, and recover solid and liquid waste32. In all these support systems, microbes are an essential component in the regulation, degradation and circulation of materials and energy, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of these life support systems. Plant cultivation Research and development of higher plant cultivation, a method of growing crops with increased productivity, enhanced nutritional value, higher volume utilization, and shorter production cycle, are necessary for the development of sustainable ecosystems in space. Higher plant cultivation modules within BLSS not only provide a means for food production but also the recycling and revitalization of air through photosynthesis, and water recycling through transpiration and waste management33. Because of their importance, plant modules, and the effects of extraterrestrial conditions on plant growth have been extensively studied34–36. For example, NASA is heavily involved in this area of research with its Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) and Vegetable Production System (Veggie) experiments on the ISS. Both APH and Veggie are automated growth chambers used by researchers to determine the effects of microgravity on plant gene expression, protein, and metabolite levels, as well as their nutritional value37. The Veggie system has successfully grown lettuce, Chinese cabbage, mizuna mustard, red Russian kale, and zinnia flowers on the ISS37 and has enhanced our understanding of plant-microbe-environment interactions in microgravity38. Using the Veggie system, Hummerick et al. characterized microorganisms found on the leaves of three leafy greens: red romaine lettuce, mizuna mustard, and green leaf lettuce, as well as the microbial communities associated with the rhizosphere in the pillow component39. Characterization revealed higher microbial diversity near roots and within root substrate compared to leaves, consistent with plants grown in terrestrial soils. Molecular and culture-based methods revealed that the crops were pathogen-free and safe for human consumption. The information gained from the APH and Veggie experiments, especially as it pertains to plant-microbe interactions, provide a foundation for future research on higher plant cultivation in microgravity and the expansion of these ideas for plant production on extraterrestrial outposts. One issue with hydroponic growth systems on Earth is microbial contamination, most often by Fusarium oxysporum40. Certain abiotic conditions such as high humidity, high temperature, and reduced airflow can cause undesirably high levels of microbial growth41,42. Veggie is a hydroponic system that has also succumbed to these limitations. Zinnia hybrida, an annual flowering plant, grown in the Veggie system on the ISS, developed foliar, stem, and root rot disease, due to high water stress and low airflow43. Whole genome sequencing analysis of the diseased tissue44 and subsequent virulence assays43, identified the culprit as F. oxysporum. This illustrates the potential difficulties of growing crops in hydroponic systems, on Earth or in space. An alternative to a hydroponic system is a soil-based one where Martian and lunar regolith can be used as an alternative to terrestrial soil. This in situ resource utilization (ISRU) of regolith would reduce the need for costly resupply missions of terrestrial soil. While many plants and crops have been successfully grown in simulated Martian and lunar regolith their characteristics do differ from what would be expected with terrestrial soil45–49. One limiting factor of regolith is the absence of reactive nitrogen, an essential nutrient for optimal plant growth and function50–54. However, the introduction of nitrogen-fixing and nitrogen-cycling bacterial species into regolith to bind nitrogen from the atmosphere and transform it into reactive nitrogen (in the form of NO3− and NH4+) could be used as a method to improve regolith soil fertility55. Increased Martian soil fertility through symbiotic relationships has been examined with clover (Melilotus officinalis), grown in simulated regolith that had been inoculated with the nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti56. This study found that after three months, inoculated treatments produced greater clover biomass compared to uninoculated treatments, 0.29 g and 0.01 g, respectively. However, when S. meliloti inoculated clover was grown in common terrestrial potting mix the total clover biomass was seven-fold greater than when grown in simulated regolith56. While plant-bacterial symbiosis could improve soil fertility and plant growth in Martian regolith, additional experiments are required to achieve terrestrial levels of plant biomass. Other plant stressors, such as limited nutrients, may prevent plants from reaching optimal biomass56. Essential nutrients, such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, nickel, and zinc, are present in extraterrestrial soils but not at sufficient levels for plant uptake. Zaets et al. showed that bacteria can increase the bioavailability of these minerals in simulated regolith using inoculants of Pseudomonas sp. IMBG163, Pseudomonas aureofaciens IMBG164, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia IMBG147, Paenibacillus sp. IMBG156, Klebsiella oxytoca IMBG26, and Pantoea agglomerans IMV45. When inoculated with these bacteria, increased bioavailability of essential nutrients in the soil and plant tissue of Tagetes patula (i.e., French marigold) led to increased plant growth, seed germination and survival45. Conversely, only 20–30% of plants grown in non-inoculated soils achieved seed germination45. In addition to increasing nutrient bioavailability, these bacteria were also able to reduce toxic levels of zinc, chromium, nickel, iron, calcium, and sodium, by up to 50%, within plant tissue45. By increasing nutrient availability and reducing toxic accumulation of ions within the soil, microorganisms can be used as a tool for conditioning Martian and lunar basalt for effective plant growth and plant nutrient uptake. Water is another crucial plant resource limited on both the Moon and Mars. Previous discoveries have found evidence of liquid water flows on Mars, coming from giant ice slabs beneath the surface57, though extracting and recycling water from these ice slabs is energetically impractical. In addition, Martian soil has limited water-holding capacity due to low organic carbon content, however, this can be improved by using bacteria that produce polysaccharides or adhesive proteins that bind soil particles, thereby increasing the moisture content of soil58. This microbe-soil interaction can be exploited on Martian outposts to reduce the need for copious amounts of water, increase soil stability, and prevent soil desiccation. Several studies on agricultural soils show that the application of microalgae and cyanobacteria to the soil can improve soil fertility and health59–61. Nascimento et al. assessed the ability of the N-fixing cyanobacteria Nostoc sp. to act as an organic fertilizer and soil conditioner under normal and drought conditions60. Researchers applied Nostoc sp. and urea as liquid fertilizers to soil growing wheat (Triticum aestivum), corn (Zea mays), and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Drought conditions were simulated by watering the plant to water holding capacity and drying the soil for 14–16 days. Under drought conditions, plants fertilized with Nostoc sp. reached a biomass 150% greater than plants continuously watered to water holding capacity; while plants fertilized only with urea attained only 70% of the biomass compared to those continuously held at water holding capacity. Researchers also found that untreated soils exhibited more leaf wilting from water stress compared to those plants grown in soil treated with Nostoc sp60. This research shows the promise that cyanobacteria can have for improving soil quality for plant growth beyond LEO. While Martian and lunar regolith are promising soil sources, they contain heavy metals, such as lead, cadmium, chromium, and arsenic, that can negatively impact plant growth and soil microbial fitness62,63. Microbes can be used for bioremediation to convert Martian and lunar regolith into soil capable of plant growth64–66. Huang et al. tested the ability of E. coli and B. subtilis to remove lead, cadmium, and chromium by cultivating samples in solutions containing varying heavy metal concentrations and environmental conditions, including pH, temperature, and equilibration time. Researchers found that both microbes successfully removed heavy metals under all conditions, though under optimal conditions, E. coli removed 60–69% of cadmium, lead, and chromium while B. subtilis removed 54–70% of cadmium, lead, and chromium67. Plant-microorganism interactions can also be a source of bioremediation by using plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria that can simultaneously remove toxic heavy metals and improve crop growth and yield68. Henao and Ghneim-Herrera investigated this bioremediation method by summarizing results from over 85 research articles and found that Acinetobacter, Agrobacterium, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Mesorhizobium, Microbacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Rhodococcus, and Variovorax all exhibited resistance to heavy metals and a high potential for bioremediation. Specifically, Klebsiella and Enterobacter exhibited the highest tolerance to heavy metals in soil and the greatest potential to mitigate plant growth inhibition under high arsenic, cadmium, and lead concentrations68. These results are mirrored by Yetunde Mutiat et al. 69, who assessed the removal efficiency of heavy metals under varying pH levels by wild-type and mutant strains of Klebisella varicola. Isolated Klebisella strains were exposed to various concentrations of lead, cadmium, arsenic, and nickel, resulting in removal of cadmium under all conditions with a maximum removal efficiency of 97.9 and 99.4% at optimal conditions of pH 7 for both wild-type and mutant strains. Microbes can also be used to remove toxins from Martian soil such as perchlorates, which are found in high levels in Martian soil and cause a significant reduction in plant survival and productivity70,71. Engineered CO2-utilizing bacteria expressing perchlorate reduction enzymes have been shown to remove harmful perchlorates from the soil while also adding essential nutrients into the soil, such as chloride ions, oxygen, and water for better plant growth72–74. Sunikumar et al. tested the ability of two perchlorate-reducing soil bacteria, Pseudomonas stutzeri and Azospirillum brasilense, to reduce perchlorates from simulated regolith and found that they removed up to 5 mM and 10 mM of perchlorates, respectively, which corresponded to a removal efficiency of 100%75. These results suggest that naturally occurring or genetically engineered microbes with high perchlorate and/or toxin-reducing efficiency should be further studied for bioremediation of perchlorate and other harmful toxins from Martian and lunar soils. Just as microorganisms are a vital part of terrestrial plant production systems, microorganisms will play an important role in higher plant production and soil systems on future deep space missions and extraterrestrial outposts. Previous research indicates that plant production using hydroponic systems is a promising method for plant production in microgravity34–36, but further optimization will be required to prevent fungal contamination in these systems43. Using soil-based plant growth systems is a promising alternative to circumvent the limitations of hydroponics, but research is limited in this area within BLSS. Therefore, further research using soil-based plant growth systems, supplemented with microorganisms, may improve the effectiveness of BLSS and self-sufficiency of astronauts on deep space missions.Wastewater treatment Water is the largest product consumed in bioregenerative systems, expending nearly 20 L per person per day76. Extensive water consumption results in large wastewater production, including urine and flush water, atmospheric condensate, sink, shower, laundry, and dish water. Microbes play a vital role in the recycling of wastewater and nutrients through recycling systems containing combinations of anaerobic digestion, distillation, and disinfectant units. Microbes also play a crucial role in solid waste processing (including bodily waste), inedible plant material, and other solid decomposable substances within bioregenerative systems. Drying is the first step to recycling solid waste30,32,77. This step allows the extraction of water from solid waste, the retention of organic matter, and the removal of inorganic material78. Dried, solid waste is then fermented in a solid waste bioreactor containing microbes that degrade plant waste32,79,80. This method has shown solid waste degradation rates between 41% and 87.7%79. The degraded solid waste can either be taken out of the system or applied to a plant system, providing a carbon and nitrogen-rich source of residue fertilizer or soil-like substance that increases soil fertility and overall plant health and productivity81–83. There are many proposed systems for microbe-assisted waste purification and recycling on spacecraft. The MELiSSA initiative proposed a loop of compartments that thoroughly recycle gas, liquid, and solid waste using microorganisms, where each output of the preceding compartment provides the input for the following compartment84. Compartment I is an anaerobic digester that utilizes thermophilic bacteria to break down inedible plant parts and solid and liquid waste. Clostridium thermocellum ferments cellulosic substrate, while Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum degrades starches and pectins, leaving volatile fatty acids, minerals and NH4+ as an output. In compartment II, photoheterotrophic bacteria, such as Rhodospirillum rubrum, metabolize volatile fatty acids. The remaining minerals and NH4+ enter compartment III where nitrifying bacteria, such as those in the species Nitrobacter or Nitrosomonas, nitrify NH4+ to NO3−, which can be utilized in the plant compartment as a fertilizer84. Overall, this system results in a nitrogen-rich output that can be utilized as fertilizer in the plant compartment for improved production. Another system proposed by Tang et al. utilizes a two-system recycling unit for either domestic water or wastewater79. Domestic water is purified by first running it through a two-stage membrane bioreactor and then passing it through a nanofiltration system, to produce hygiene water. The second system utilizes anaerobic, mostly Bacteroidetes, and aerobic, mostly Proteobacteria, microbial bioreactors to recover organic matter and N from wastewater79. Within this system, microorganisms are also utilized to degrade solid waste as part of the microbial fermentation facility or Bio-toilet. The facility includes a source separation module that separates urine from feces, a primary bioreactor where feces are combined with other inedible plant material to be degraded by microorganisms, and a secondary bioreactor for further degradation by microbes. This system was tested during 108-day experiment housing four crew members at the China Astronaut Research and Training Center. Researchers achieved 100% water regeneration with 87.7% recycled solid waste79,80. Although BLSS can obtain 100% water recovery, nitrogen recovery efficiency is still lacking. One option to improve nitrogen recovery is to utilize urease-producing microorganisms to hydrolyze urea, a compound found in human urine at high levels (>13 g/L)85,86. Urease-producing microorganisms, such as Bacillus, Sporosarcina, Pseudomonas, and Paracoccus, used in conjunction with membrane-biological activated carbon reactor systems by Xie et al. showed that BLSS can obtain water recovery of 100% with N recovery of up to 79.33%, which are comparable to efficiencies obtained by Tang et al.79. Another urine-fueled system for waste recycling, proposed by Maggi et al., includes a soil-based BLSS aimed at recycling liquid wastes using a plant-microbe system87. The growth chambers for dwarf wheat and soybean contain three systems for water and urine injection, atmospheric circulation, and ventilation. Once injected into the soil, a number of bacteria can release nitrogen-based intermediates, such as NH4+ and NO3− from organic nitrogen compounds for plants to uptake. Results indicated that urine decomposition met the nutrient demands of the plants as evidenced by successful growth of the dwarf wheat and soybean plants with comparable biomass generation to those grown on Earth. Plant-microbe systems can provide other methods of wastewater recycling. Plants are excellent water purifiers and can release 2–10 L of water vapor from their leaves through the process of transpiration88. Plants uptake water through their roots, absorb nutrients into plant tissue, and transpire water through their stomata. Applying wastewater as a means of watering plants would effectively turn wastewater into clean water through this natural process. However, before plants can be exposed to wastewater, it would need to be pre-treated to reduce organic loading in soil and remove phytotoxic or other detrimental compounds that would affect plant growth and metabolism89,90. This can be achieved with microbial bioreactors through the mechanisms described above, allowing for eco-friendly water reclamation.Atmosphere revitalization It is projected that crew members on a lunar mission will inhale about 1 kg of O2 per day and exhale approximately 1.3 kg of CO291. Production of O2 and removal of CO2 during space missions could be achieved through photosynthesis, the process by which plants, algae and cyanobacteria convert CO2, sunlight, and water, into O2 and energy92. Cyanobacteria are the earliest oxygenic photosynthetic organisms on Earth and have been contributing to Earth’s atmospheric oxygen for the last 2.5 billion years93,94. One advantage of using cyanobacteria over plants for air revitalization is their ability to perform photosynthesis with far less sunlight than is required for plant growth. Under normal conditions, plants and cyanobacteria use chlorophyll-a to convert visible (i.e. “white”) light into energy, but some cyanobacteria can perform far-red photosynthesis, using chlorophyll-f, a spectrally red-shifted variant of chlorophyll-a which absorbs longer wavelengths of light95–97. This allows those cyanobacteria to also perform photosynthesis and harvest energy when grown in low- or filtered- light environments95–97. This photosynthetic efficiency, coupled with the ability to survive the harsh conditions of space98–101 make cyanobacteria ideal components in BLSS destined for the Moon and Mars. Photobioreactors can be incorporated into BLSS to increase the production of oxygen by cyanobacteria or algae for enhanced air revitalization. ESA’s MELiSSA project is a BLSS concept focused on the regeneration of atmospheric gases and water, waste treatment, and food production for crewed space missions102,103. The system comprises the listed compartments, each with a specific organism contributing to the recycling pathway104. One of the five compartments includes a gas-lift photobioreactor containing photosynthetic cyanobacteria, specifically Spirulina platensis, that uses the CO2 produced by its predecessor compartment to produce oxygen84. S. platensis was chosen for its light energy conversion efficiency, its ability to tolerate fluctuations in pH, and its high nutritional value (containing 55–70% protein, 15–25% carbohydrates, 18% essential fatty acids in addition to vitamins, minerals, and pigments105). Another species of cyanobacteria that is being considered for air revitalization, nitrate removal and edible biomass production in MELiSSA is Limnospira indica. In a recent 35-day ground study, L. indica was grown in a simplified closed-loop version of MELiSSA and the effect of urea, ammonium (the prominent nitrogen forms present in non-nitrified urine) and nitrate, on the oxygen production capacity of L. indica, was measured106. It was observed that cyanobacteria fed nitrate or urea could effectively reach the desired (set point) O2 level of 20.3% and maintain ambient O2 levels, while those fed ammonium could only reach a maximum O2 level of 19.5%106. This study provided preliminary evidence for the use of ammonium-rich and urea-rich media (such as urine), for L. indica cultivation and air revitalization. L. indica has also been grown in photobioreactors on the ISS, as part of the Arthrospira-B spaceflight experiment, and no inhibitory effect on oxygen production and growth was observed, as compared to ground controls107. These studies show the promise of cyanobacteria-based BLSS and/or photobioreactors destined for the Moon and Mars to provide clean air for crew in spacecraft or in lunar/Mars habitats. Additional research is needed for optimization such as identifying additional candidate species, growing combinations of different cyanobacteria for synergistic effects, and testing more growth conditions to achieve enhanced biomass and increased efficiency.Biological in situ resource utilization for sustainability In addition to BLSS which can increase self-sufficiency and sustainability beyond LEO, the ability to utilize in situ resources, will also play a role in long-term human habitats on the Moon and Mars. For instance, electricity and power can be generated with microbial fuel cells (MFC) coupled with in situ organic material, and biomining can be used to extract resources for construction, repair, and maintenance of structural components and equipment. Microbial fuel cells Microbial production of energy has gained much interest in the last decade. To keep pace with human energy consumption, many scientists have turned towards the use of microbial fuel cells as a sustainable method of energy production on Earth108. These alternative methods of energy production could also be applied for space exploration as a sustainable method to power the spacecraft, mission controls, and various life support systems. MFC are small, lightweight devices that convert organic matter from renewable sources into electricity using microorganisms as catalysts109 (Fig. 2). Microorganisms involved in this electrochemical activity are called exoelectrogens because of their ability to transfer electrons exogenously to electron acceptors109. Some examples of exoelectrogens include Pseudomonas110, Shewanella111, Geobacter112, and Desulfuromonas113. Fig. 2. Microbial fuel cell. Open in a new tab MFC consists of two chambers, separated by a proton exchange membrane. In the anode chamber, exoelectrogens, shown as a biofilm in this figure, anaerobically oxidize organic matter releasing protons and electrons. A closer look at this interaction can be seen in the bottom image. The electrons released during the oxidation of organic matter transfer to the anode and travel to the cathode in the second chamber via an external circuit, creating an electrical current. The protons released travel through the proton exchange membrane into the cathode chamber, where the protons and electrons react with oxygen and form water.The idea behind MFC has been around for over a century, but it is just within the past few decades that it has become a commercialized product. MFC can produce an energy output up to 5.61 W/m2114–116, and can also be used for wastewater recycling, toxin removal, bioremediation, and resource recovery117–121. These same concepts can be utilized on future Martian or lunar extraterrestrial outposts for energy production and within BLSS. In 2007, de Vet and Rutgers were the first to test the capabilities of MFC energy production under simulated and real microgravity conditions aboard the ISS using Rhodoferax ferrireducens to produce electricity. Energy output averaged 0.1 mA in 1 G, 0.35 mA in simulated microgravity, and 0.02 mA on the ISS. While the differences were not statistically significant, the study did show the potential for MFC to operate in space122. This mechanism for energy production is not yet practical for space travel due to the low energy output, considering a standard 40 W light bulb draws 0.36 A to operate, but can be initially utilized for its byproducts, such as clean wastewater123. Waste recycling as an energy source Waste can accumulate during space travel in the form of urine, fecal matter, and inedible food and with the help of microbes, this waste can be repurposed for energy production as well as for nutrient recovery and production of potable water. Urine is an excellent feedstock for MFC as it contains high levels of urea, organic ammonium salts, and other organic compounds that microbes can convert into electricity86 thus making urine MFC effective mechanisms for energy production124–127. Some urine MFC can not only produce energy but recover nutrients as well. Lu et al. designed a three-chamber MFC to remove organic pollutants, recover N, phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S), and produce energy from urine125. The maximum power output was 1300 mW/m2, with almost complete removal of pollutants, including over 97% of urea, total nitrogen, sulfate, phosphate, and chemical oxygen demand, as well as 40% of ammonium, 15% of salts, and 91-99% of organic compounds. The MFC also recovered essential nutrients, including 42% of total N, 37% of phosphate, 59% of sulfate and 33% of total salts125. This recovery technology can be especially valuable within other compartments of BLSS, including plant compartments, by providing nutrient-rich water free of contaminants. In order for urine MFC to also be used as a mechanism to convert urine to potable water, the high level of inorganic salts present in urine (~14.2 g/L)86 need to first be removed for MFC to function efficiently125. This can be achieved with an alternative type of MFC, called a microbial desalination cell, which follows the same concept as a standard MFC but with an added desalination chamber between the anode and cathode128. Cao et al. tested this mechanism of water desalination at concentrations comparable to the salinity of urine at 5, 20, and 35 g/L using a mixed bacterial culture, with the salt concentration determined by a change in conductivity of the solution128. This microbial desalination cell produced a maximum power output of 2 W/m2, with ~88–94% of salt removed, depending on the initial concentration128. Other organic components of wastewater, such as human feces, can be a resource for electricity generation by MFC as well. Fangzhou et al. tested the capabilities of MFC to generate electricity from activated sludge obtained from a sewage treatment plant for specific use within BLSS for future crewed outposts129. Tests were performed using a standard or adjustable two-chamber MFC, a one-chamber MFC with one or two membrane electrode assemblies, and a fermentation pre-treatment device. The highest maximum power output was 70.8 mW/m2 produced by the two-chamber MFC, however, the authors concluded that for space applications, the one-chamber configuration was better, as it produced a more stable output, at 0.3 V129. The efficiency of pollutant removal was also tested, with about 44% removal of ammonium and 71% of organic material with each configuration129. To further increase power generation and toxin removal from fecal wastewater, fermentation pre-treatment was proposed. This involved using reactors filled with anaerobic sludge to degrade fecal macromolecules into smaller organic molecules129. Pre-treating fecal wastewater by fermentation produced 47% more power than no pre-treatment, suggesting a preference of exoelectrogens within MFC for smaller organic molecules129. Based on these results, the authors developed an automatic human feces wastewater MFC system containing a fermentation pre-treatment device to simultaneously dispose of one day’s worth of feces and generate electricity. Indeed, the maximum power output of the system was 240 mW/m2, about 3.5-fold higher than the standard two-chamber MFC system129. Inedible food waste will be an inevitable part of spaceflight and extraterrestrial outposts on the Moon and Mars that need to be disposed of, as on Earth. This organic material can act as substrates in MFC for energy production, Colombo et al. tested the energy producing capabilities of MFC with various food-industry organic wastes as inputs, including those rich in fibers, sugars, proteins, and acid130. A one-chamber MFC was fed each type of organic substrate, and the concentration of organic compounds was measured periodically to obtain the rate of degradation. The maximum power output for each organic waste substrate was 50 mV for sugar, 40 mV for fiber, 30 mV for protein, and 10 mV for acid, with each organic compound degraded by 90%130. While MFC will be a useful tool to create energy and recycle organic waste beyond LEO, research and development is still ongoing to develop more efficient systems with a larger and sustained power output. Some of these ideas involve the use of different materials (such as ceramics) and configurations (large vs small, stacked vs dispersed)131. Gajda et al. tested a small (70 mm long, 15 mm diameter, 2 mm thickness) and a large (100 mm long, 42 mm diameter, 3 mm thickness) terracotta MFC. They found that the smaller terracotta MFC achieved a power density output 2.9-fold greater than the large MFC, at 20.4 W/m3 and 7.0 W/m3, respectively. Gajda et al. also tested the performance of stacking MFC for a small-scale multi-unit system that could be utilized on future crewed outposts132. They compared power output of a small module containing 28 MFC units and a larger module containing 560 MFC units. Stacked 560 units created a five-fold improvement in power output of 245 mW compared to the 28 MFC unit. Another concept is the PeePower urinals which collect urine and feces directly from the source, producing energy through multiple ceramic MFC133. This leads to concentrated wastewater inputted into the MFC rather than diluted samples, which reduces power output. Researchers tested a 288-unit MFC on a university campus which averaged 5–10 users per day. The PeePower urinals were able to produce an average of 75 mW which powered the LED lights directly connected to the MFC stack for 75 h. Another 432-unit MFC was tested during a large music festival which averaged 1000 users per day. In this setting, the PeePower urinals were able to produce an average of 300 mW which successfully powered lighting within the urinals over a seven-day period133. While the success of PeePower was demonstrated on Earth, it will be important to test similar models of power generation using urine and feces in microgravity. None the less, this research provides the foundation for the development of similar toilet-like MFC to be used for power generation on deep space missions.Plant MFC Plant compartments within BLSS can be used for energy production in MFC as well. Healthy soils contain organic matter from decaying plant litter as well as carbohydrate flux directed out of the roots into the rhizosphere134. In theory, the anode chamber of a MFC could be positioned within the rhizosphere to capitalize on the symbiotic microbes present to oxidize this continuous source of organic matter to generate an electrical current. Such a soil MFC was tested using rice plants, where 330 W/ha of power was produced in the presence of actively growing plants, a seven-fold higher energy output compared to the energy output of soil MFC not using plants135. This technology is not limited to only soil-based systems but can be applied to hydroponic plant systems as well, in which the anode is situated within the water chamber surrounding plant roots136. Research by Lee and Miller, growing Bacopa monnieri and with the addition of Escherichia coli, obtained a power density output of up to 1.9 W/m2 with a 34% increase in plant growth fueled by plant essential nutrients supplied by E. coli acting within the fuel cell136. In addition to electricity generation, soil MFC can be used for the remediation of heavy metal contaminated regolith64. Habibul et al. tested the ability of soil MFC to remove chromium from soil using ryegrass. The soil MFC was fed a solution of varying concentrations of chromium, resulting in >90% removal efficiency by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. In addition, the higher the concentration of chromium, the higher the current density output, reaching a maximum of 55 mA/m2137. These results show the promise of energy generation through plant-system powered MFC with the added benefit of increasing plant yield for consumption by crewmembers.Solar power Photosynthetic microorganisms, such as algae or cyanobacteria, can be utilized to convert light energy into electrical energy, termed microbial electrochemical technology72. Biophotovoltaics is a specific type of electrochemical technology in which phototrophic microorganisms produce electricity by utilizing incoming light energy to split water molecules, generating electrons and protons that can be used to produce an electrical current within an MFC. Several cyanobacteria species have been tested for use in biophotovoltaics, such as Synechocystis138,139, Nostoc140,141, Lyngbya142,143, and Leptolyngbia144,145. Kaushik et al. tested the energy producing capabilities of Synechococcus using a two-chamber photosynthetic MFC built with light transparent glass146. The MFC operated through a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle under a white light intensity of 15 W/m2. Maximum power density output of the photosynthetic MFC was 0.61 W/m2146. This technology provides a feasible method of energy production on extraterrestrial outposts, but further research needs to be completed to increase power output and optimize light conversion. Research on the use of in situ resources such as wastewater, plant systems, and solar radiation, shows potential for the use of MFC as a mode of power generation and sustainability on extraterrestrial outposts. Though power generation is limited from these substrates at the moment future work may enhance their efficiency. In addition, other sources of power, such as nuclear power, could supplement these MFC systems to provide adequate power generation in habitats and spacecraft beyond LEO147.Biomining Biomining is an environmentally friendly and affordable alternative to traditional physical-chemical mineral processing methods to extract metals of economic interest from rock ores or mine waste. The process involves specific microorganisms that secrete organic acids and metal-binding compounds that essentially dissolve these metals, allowing them to be easily extracted from the environment148. Biomining is commonly applied to pyritic ores and completed by iron-oxidizing bacteria, such as Thiobacillus ferrooxidans149, Leptospirillum ferrooxidans150, and Acidimicrobium ferrooxidans151. With the reduced iron in the form of pyrite, the bacteria produce iron that oxidizes metal sulfides to sulfuric acid which further accelerates rock dissolution152–154. These species, along with those in the Sulfobacillus and Acidianus genera, as well as many iron-oxidizing bacteria, are used for the biomining of copper, zinc, uranium, nickel, aluminum, and cobalt155. The biomining process is not limited to Earth. It may serve as an innovative method for reducing the cost of raw materials and energy requirements beyond LEO, enhancing the sustainability of life on extraterrestrial outposts. Martian and lunar basalt are known to contain many valuable metals, such as iron, nickel, copper, vanadium, and many others, that are suitable substrates that can be biomined by microbes156,157. Biomining of these metals from Martian and lunar surfaces could provide the necessary materials for the in-situ construction of buildings, electrical systems, spacecraft equipment, solar cells, and heating and lighting systems in human habitats beyond LEO158. Recent research on the ISS simulating biomining of essential compounds from basalt under microgravity demonstrated the possibility for microbial mining beyond Earth159–161. Cockell et al. tested the rare Earth element (REE) biomining capabilities of three microorganisms, Sphingomonas desiccabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Cupriavidus metallidurans, under three different levels of gravity: microgravity, simulated Martian gravity, and terrestrial gravity, and against a non-biological control160. Biomining reactions took place within biomining reactors. Within each reactor, researchers placed growth media, sterilized basalt slides with a known REE and single strain cultures of each microorganism. Biomining capabilities were assessed based on absolute quantities of REE in ng obtained from 6 mL bulk fluid collected from the biomining reactors and compared to the non-biological control, consisting of a sterile basalt slide without cell inoculation160. REEs assessed include lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium. The concentration of each REE extracted was proportional to the known abundance in the basaltic rock. At all simulated gravity levels, S. desiccabilis demonstrated enhanced biomining capabilities per gram of basalt substrate, producing 32.52 ng under microgravity, 43.09 ng under Mars gravity, and 32.26 ng under Earth’s gravity, compared to the non-biological mining control, which produced 24.67 ng under microgravity, 21.36 ng under Mars gravity, and 13.25 ng under Earth’s gravity. These values represent the combined mass of biomined REEs. B. subtilis and C. metallidurans demonstrated no differences under the simulated gravity conditions tested and underperformed compared to the non-biological control. As part of the same flight experiment, Cockell et al. tested the biomining capabilities for vanadium (a critical, high-strength element used as a building material), using the same methods and organisms as the Cockell et al. study described above160,161. S. desiccabilis and B. subtilis increased mined vanadium yield, achieving a two-fold increase in mined vanadium 184.92% and 283.22% under microgravity, 216.32% and 219.78% under Mars gravity, and 208.70% and 221.59% under Earth’s gravity, respectively, compared to the control160. With the abundance of iron in Mars regolith (17.9% wt), iron may be a crucial resource produced through biomining162. Iron is one of the most-processed metals on Earth that is incorporated in most building materials and would be heavily relied on for construction, repair, and maintenance of buildings at extraterrestrial outposts. Copper is another important metal that can be produced through biomining, with nearly 20–30% of all copper produced on Earth extracted through biomining162. For over 30 years, copper has been an essential metal used in the construction of rocket engines163,164 and being able to extract copper and other minerals from in situ resources on extraterrestrial outposts will allow engine maintenance and repair to occur beyond LEO, reducing the cost and time of sending replacement parts from Earth. Other economically essential elements have been found in asteroidal material and Martian regolith and can be extracted through biomining165–167. These include those in the platinum group, including palladium and osmium, and the 17 REEs. During the Viking Mission to Mars, palladium-silver tubing was utilized in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to detect organic compounds, and it would be important for future research on Mars in the search for extraterrestrial life168. In addition to machinery, REE can be used in building and fixing methods for power generation, specifically solar panels169. Lastly, REE are found in electronic screens and fluorescent lights, both necessary for data collection, communication, and the general well-being of those on extraterrestrial outposts170. The biomining process Bioreactors are necessary for biomining reactions to occur. Terrestrial biomining processes most often occur in open, non-sterile tank reactors that require constant stirring to distribute oxygen and nutrients171. To implement biomining on extraterrestrial outposts, it is essential to assess the extent to which differing gravity levels impact microbe-mineral interactions within these stirred-tank bioreactors. An experiment called BioRock, aimed to do this by creating a prototype biomining reactor for space experimentation on the ISS159. The biomining reactor has three main components: the culture chamber, the medium reservoir chamber, and a fixative reservoir chamber, where a fixative is injected to halt microbial growth after the biomining reactions take place (Fig. 3). Two biomining reactors are placed together within two levels of containment. Pre-test flights found the bioreactors to be successful at growing the model microorganisms, S. desiccabilis, B. subtilis, and C. metallidurans. These microorganisms were chosen as they are low-risk pathogens with the ability to survive desiccation for space flight, limited requirements for growth, and are present in mineral-rich environments. Growth was determined based on optical density in nutrient solution after three weeks. For S. desiccabilis, growth occurred in all tested geometries of biomining reactors, ranging from 0.308 to 0.804 OD159. BioRock has also been successfully used to test REE and vanadium biomining capabilities of S. desiccabilis, B. subtilis, and C. metallidurans in microgravity, Mars gravity and Earth’s gravity160,161. Fig. 3. Schematic depiction of a biomining reactor. Open in a new tab The biomining reactor has three main components: the culture chamber, the media reservoir chamber, and a fixative reservoir chamber (shown in section 1). The culture chamber is where the biomining reactions take place and where the microorganisms reside before the media is injected. The media reservoir chamber contains the nutrients required for the biomining reaction to occur and is injected into the culture chamber to begin the biomining reaction (section 2). Once the biomining reaction is completed, a fixative is injected to halt microbial growth (section 3).An additional method of biomining, proposed by Volger et al., utilizes a two-bioreactor system and aims to further enhance ISRU on Martian outposts compared to traditional bioreactors172. The first system is an algae bioreactor, which utilizes Chlorella vulgaris to produce biomass for the biomining reactor and oxygen. The algal biomass is then utilized by Shewanella oneidensis as a growth medium in the biomining reactor. In the biomining reactor, S. oneidensis mines iron ores from Martian regolith; the biomass-rich material left over after extraction can then be used for plant growth. Based on modeled algae growth and biomining performance, the system is projected to produce 0.031 kg O2 per day and 100 kg of iron per Mars year172. This model needs to be further tested and future experiments should include exposure to various gravity conditions to assess the impact that this spaceflight stressor will have on growth and performance. The BioRock experiment and other biomining endeavors using iron-oxidizing and alternative candidate bacteria demonstrate potential for biomining in differing gravity levels and the potential for biomining as a source of ISRU at future Martian and lunar outposts. Biomining for elements known to be located within Martian and lunar regolith, such as iron and REE, will be essential for proper maintenance and production of devices and technology that promote sustainability and provide a foundation by which to launch operations for deep space exploration.Bioengineered microbes for space Microorganisms are an important, renewable resource that can be leveraged to produce pharmaceuticals or therapeutics, biological life support systems, and manufacturing materials for human space exploration and colonization that could help reduce the need for costly resupply missions beyond LEO173. Candidate microbes can be chosen for these applications based on the availability of genetic tools for manipulation, desired metabolic properties, and tolerance to environmental conditions. These microbes can be further engineered to make them more well-suited for biotechnological applications for interplanetary travel or extraterrestrial settlements using synthetic biology tools. Synthetic biology involves the rational design or repurposing of living organisms and biological systems. Using synthetic biology, microorganisms can be engineered or built de novo with characterized parts and tools to endow them with new or improved functions173. Biotherapeutics The risk that long-duration space missions pose for crewmembers is not yet completely understood but the extreme conditions, such as microgravity, radiation, and confinement, coupled with microbiome dysregulation may lead to or enhance the disruption of bodily functions174. Researchers have studied the effect of simulated or actual spaceflight conditions on gastrointestinal (GI) problems175, the development of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders176, or a predisposition to contracting infections177–179. The use of probiotics as a countermeasure to combat changes in the microbiome as a result of spaceflight is being investigated to support astronaut health on long-duration space missions180,181. Probiotics are living organisms able to survive in the gastric environment that provide health benefits and maintain or improve microbiome balance when consumed. On Earth, probiotics have been used to treat many ailments including weight and muscle loss, inflammation, dermatitis, immune disorders, mental health, and GI conditions (i.e., diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD))180,182. Probiotic viability in space Promising probiotic candidates for space missions could include Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, to counteract their decrease in relative abundance in the astronaut microbiome during spaceflight183,184. While these species are commercially used on Earth their efficacy and long-term viability when used and stored in space has to still be verified. In 2017, Shao et al. examined the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus in simulated microgravity and observed no effect on cellular morphology or adhesion. However, some biological changes were present compared to controls, such as increased growth rate at early time points, acid tolerance (pH < 2.5) by ~22–32%, bile tolerance at low concentrations, antibacterial activity, and resistance to antibiotics (i.e., cefalexin, gentamicin, penicillin)185. The following year, the shelf life of freeze-dried Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota press-through capsules was tested in spaceflight conditions aboard the ISS186. After one month of storage in ambient conditions (i.e., temperature 20–24.5 °C, absorbed dose rate 0.26 mGy/day) and six months after the start of the experiment, bacteria in flight samples were sustained in sufficient numbers that were comparable to ground controls. There were no observed changes in probiotic viability, and the basic probiotic properties of the bacteria including growth rate, carbohydrate fermentation, cell-wall polysaccharide integrity, and resistance to intracellular digestion remained intact upon thawing186. A lengthier shelf-life analysis of freeze-dried cells for three commercial probiotics including Bifidobacterium longum, L. acidophilus and spores of B. subtilis was then performed in a simulated three-year round-trip to Mars187. In under 200 days, B. longum and L. acidophilus viability was decreased by about 2-logs while B. subtilis maintained viability up to the end of the experiment (545 days). Therefore, researchers concluded that freeze-dried bacterial spores showed the most promise for withstanding long-duration space missions including ambient spacecraft conditions and radiation with an estimated shelf-life of 4.7 years187. Overall, these studies provide foundational information on the storage, stability, and viability of probiotic candidates when flown in space. These results suggest that with further testing, probiotic bacteria can be an essential component of the astronaut medical toolkit for the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome, prevention and treatment of bacterial infections or medical concerns that may arise in future space missions.Engineered probiotics to combat infection In addition to the observed decrease in beneficial bacteria, microbial tracking studies have shown that spaceflight conditions can also lead to an increase in opportunistic pathogens in both the built microbiome and astronaut microbiome. This is particularly problematic due to the dysregulated immunity of astronauts in space178. Since antibiotics are the most commonly used therapeutic for the treatment of bacterial infections, researchers are investigating whether microbes can be used for antibiotic production in space. This is particularly relevant considering that antibiotics are known to have accelerated degradation and decreased efficacy when flown and stored in space for long periods of time188. On the Space Shuttle Mission STS-77, Lam et al. analyzed the effects of spaceflight on the production of monorden by Humicola fuscoatra WC5157, a marine fungus. Monorden has demonstrated antimicrobial activity against pathogenic fungi and antitumour activity on human tumor cell growth in vitro189. Using solid-state fermentation, researchers observed up to 190% increased yield of the antifungal in spaceflight compared to ground controls at 23.8 and 8.2 μg, respectively190. Similar results were obtained in another study analyzing the production of actinomycin D, an antibiotic and antitumor agent, by Streptomyces plicatus on the ISS. After 17 days in orbit, the amount of antibiotic produced by ISS samples increased by up to 577% compared to ground controls191, and over a 72-day period, researchers noted increased production of actinomycin D in ISS samples specifically at early time points192. While much work is yet to be done toward on-demand microbial production of antibiotics in space, these studies demonstrate that microbes are a promising platform for this application. Elucidating the mechanism driving this increased yield early in antibiotic production in microgravity could enable the engineering of bacteria for enhanced antibiotic or therapeutic bioprocessing in space or even be applied to increase antibiotic production on Earth. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) may arise in space as a side effect of administering antibiotics to treat infections. Several studies have investigated the use of Debaryomyces hansenii as a treatment for AAD in a mouse model. D. hansenii is commonly used in the food industry for the processing of cheese and has been identified as part of the human gut microbiome193,194. When administered for treatment of AAD, D. hansenii alters the composition of the microbiome by promoting the growth of beneficial lactase-producing bacteria and by inhibiting the growth of opportunistic pathogens195–197. In one study, the presence of Proteobacteria in the intestinal mucosa increased in response to diarrhea, from ~19% in a normal group to ~36% in an AAD model group, and treatment with D. hansenii was able to restore Proteobacteria to normal levels195. Proteobacteria abundance often positively correlates with IBD and inflammation and is generally regarded as an indicator of microbiome instability198. In spaceflight, the proportion of Proteobacteria in the astronaut skin microbiome was decreased, namely Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria175, while it was increased in the salivary microbiome199. While bacterial infections are typically treated with antimicrobials, the formation of biofilms and propagation of multi-drug resistance in the spaceflight environment (discussed later in this review) limits these therapeutic options. A promising alternative currently being investigated on Earth is the use of engineered microorganisms as live biotherapeutics (e.g., biosensors, probiotics with enhanced benefits, and drug delivery systems)200–204. Well-established microbial chassis organisms include E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, though a microbe more well-suited to the target therapeutic environment or application can also be chosen. One example using a less conventional chassis was recently performed by Garrido et al. where they engineered Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a human lung pathogen, as a live biotherapeutic to treat S. aureus and other biofilm-associated infections in vivo205. Researchers created an attenuated strain of M. pneumoniae able to secrete anti-biofilm and bactericidal enzymes, dispersin B and lysostaphin, and demonstrated its ability to eliminate an S. aureus biofilm in a mouse model205. Another candidate chassis that could be employed to eradicate pathogens is D. hansenii, which produces volatile organic compounds and mycocins that have demonstrated antimicrobial effects on several pathogenic bacteria and fungi. An alternative to secreting bactericidal proteins to kill pathogens is the incorporation of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology into synthetic designs to create engineered probiotics for targeted bacterial killing. This was demonstrated by Neil et al. by delivering CRISPR/Cas9 on a conjugative plasmid which led to 99.9% eradication of antibiotic resistant E. coli and complete eradication of Citrobacter rodentium in the GI tract of a mouse model206. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing has also been demonstrated in D. hansenii207, and could be applied to engineer this strain for increased production of mycocins that can target C. albicans208,209. Microbes can also be engineered as biosensors to identify or inhibit pathogenic bacteria by sensing an important indicator molecule and releasing a signal or enzyme in response. For instance, biological targeting systems have been demonstrated using engineered E. coli for directed killing of the biofilm-associated pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that has been demonstrated to have increased biofilm formation and pathogenicity on the ISS210. Saeidi et al. engineered E. coli with a synthetic genetic circuit containing three modules: sensing, lysing, and killing. The sensing module includes a constitutively expressed transcription factor, lasR, which detects and binds to N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL), a quorum sensing molecule released from P. aeruginosa. This bound complex activates the lysing and killing modules expressing lysis E7 and pyocin S5 proteins, respectively. This leads to perforation of the E. coli cell membrane and release of the bacteriocin which targets the pathogen and killed 99% of viable cells211. Following this study, Hwang et al. programmed E. coli with a modular circuit containing the same sensing module coupled to a motility and killing module. The motility module expressed the chemotaxis protein CheZ to initiate motility toward the pathogen, while the killing module produced antimicrobial and biofilm-degrading proteins, MccS and DNaseI. Viability of P. aeruginosa was examined and found that E. coli harboring both the motility and killing biosensor modules resulted in the killing of 60% of cells210. Biological sensors to detect and/or reduce pathogenic bacteria using traditional chassis such as engineered Lactobacillus or E. coli have also been demonstrated against intestinal P. aeruginosa212, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus213, Candida albicans214, and S. aureus215,216. These studies highlight the vast potential of engineered microbes to sense and kill space microbiome-associated pathogens and disrupt biofilms. Since the choice of probiotics is both bacteria- and ailment-dependent217, the use of synthetic biology to create genetically engineered biotherapeutics with higher complexity and multiple functions (i.e., able to target multiple pathogens) is vital to minimize the amount of cargo on future space missions. The viability of these therapeutics for humans and their ability to function in the conditions of spaceflight still need to be investigated, but these examples help to shed light on what the next generation of engineered biotherapeutics could offer.Engineered probiotics for disease prevention and detection Engineered probiotics can also be a valuable tool for the prevention or detection of more serious health issues such as GI disorders, kidney stones, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), or the treatment of their associated symptoms. Space-induced changes in the gut microbiome observed in astronauts aboard the ISS by Voorhies et al. included an increase in Parasutterella, a bacteria associated with IBD175. In IBD pathology, purinergic receptors are activated by extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) released by commensal gut bacteria and immune cells, promoting intestinal inflammation. Engineered yeast probiotics containing a human P2Y2 purinergic receptor have been developed for the treatment of IBD by responding to physiological eATP levels and secreting the eATP-degrading enzyme apyrase218. This probiotic was shown to be effective in a mouse model of IBD, decreasing intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis. Bacterial probiotics can also be engineered to detect gut inflammation by sensing tetrathionate, thiosulfate or nitric oxide219,220, or with programmable memory systems to detect and respond to an environmental stimulus221. The risk of kidney stones due to bone decalcification, dehydration, or increased growth rate of calcium-depositing nanobacteria222–224 is increased in spaceflight, which could also be prevented or treated using probiotics. Calcium oxalate is the major component of kidney stones, therefore ideal probiotic bacteria are efficient in oxalate degradation, such as Oxalobacter formigenes225 and B. subtilis. B. subtilis strain 168 has been presented as a novel probiotic therapy as it has been shown to break down the oxalate in kidney stones in a Drosophila model226. The oxalate decarboxylase (OxDC) enzyme derived from B. subtilis can also be used to engineer other bacteria as probiotics for the treatment of kidney stones. The expression and subsequent purification of this enzyme in E. coli was able to reduce oxalate concentrations in a mouse model in urine and feces by 44% and 72%, respectively, compared to controls227. The OxDC gene was also introduced into Lactobacillus plantarum on a plasmid, leading to expression and secretion of this enzyme where it was able to degrade 70–77% of oxalate in vitro, and reduced oxalate as well as calcium, uric acid, creatinine, serum uric acid, and BUN/creatinine ratio in urine compared to controls in a rat model228. Probiotics including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium can also be used to improve cardiovascular health by reducing weight, cholesterol, and adipose tissue while also preventing or attenuating injuries to the heart (e.g., heart failure, ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy)229. Using a rat model, Lactobacillus rhamnosus or a placebo was administered to subjects following coronary artery occlusion for a six-week duration. Compared to placebo controls, rats given the probiotic treatment showed attenuation of left ventricular hypertrophy, improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function, and additional improvements up to six weeks after withdrawing treatment230. Other Lactobacillus species have had positive effects on CVD including L. plantarum which helped to reduce serum levels of leptin and fibrinogen, which are CVD risk factors231. These probiotics can also be genetically engineered to enhance their potential benefits. For instance, E. coli Nissle 1917 has been genetically engineered to produce N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines which, when administered to mice, led to decreased adiposity, insulin resistance and lipid accumulation in the liver232. This has important implications for astronauts as spaceflight can induce negative, aging-like effects on the cardiovascular system (i.e., decreased fitness, arterial stiffening, and insulin resistance) and radiation exposure has been well-characterized to increase the risk of developing radiation-induced cardiovascular disease (RICVD)233,234. Crewmembers are at an elevated risk of cancer development due to radiation and other spaceflight factors235–237. As such, methods for cancer prevention and treatment are important to implement during deep space exploration and bacterial-mediated cancer therapies could be a promising approach Bacteria can be used naturally or engineered for cancer therapy to specifically target and colonize tumors, or as a drug delivery system for anticancer agents238. Many bacteria have been investigated for these applications including Bifidobacterium239, E. coli240–242, Clostridium243,244, Salmonella245–249, and Streptococcus250 species. A study using E. coli engineered with synthetic adhesins to target a tumor antigen in vivo found that lower doses of engineered E. coli were required to colonize tumors compared to wild-type controls240. Tumor targeting was also demonstrated in an attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium harboring a short hairpin RNA expression plasmid. It was engineered to target inhibin, a tumor marker, resulting in significant inhibition of colon cancer and melanoma growth in a mouse tumor model247. Bacteria can also be engineered to improve tumor and metastasis visualization within mammalian hosts, facilitating their use as diagnostic and therapeutic microbial agents. For example, E. coli was engineered to express an acoustic reporter gene allowing them to be imaged noninvasively in vivo and to produce protein-nanoparticle gas vesicles for targeted breast cancer therapy242. E. coli was also engineered with lacZ, encoding the β-galactosidase reporter, which can be easily detected in urine as an indicator of liver metastasis251. Bacteria hold great potential for the development of easily modifiable biotherapeutics that could be invaluable for treatment or prevention of health issues during long-duration space missions. However, additional research and clinical validation is necessary before employing engineered bacteria as biotherapeutics for space-associated disorders and diseases.Life support and nutrition BLSS can provide crew members with oxygen, food, and water, and will be imperative for long-duration space missions and for the establishment of sustainable human habitats on the Moon or Mars. Due to their diverse applications for spaceflight, microalgae and cyanobacteria are often studied for their incorporation in BLSS and photobioreactors. They produce oxygen, remove carbon dioxide from the environment and help with water purification104,105,252,253. These microbes are also edible allowing their biomass to provide nutritional and therapeutic benefits without the need for protein purification35,254. Enhanced photosynthesis Oxygen for astronauts on the ISS is currently transported in pressurized tanks from Earth or is produced using water onboard through electrolysis255. Therefore, the ability to improve carbon uptake and oxygen output using microbes on the ISS, for space travel and in future extraterrestrial habitats, is an essential step toward the creation of sustainable and self-sufficient systems. Oxygen production, CO2 capture, and photosynthetic capacity could be enhanced in BLSS using synthetic biology tools to address the bottleneck of photosynthesis: the carbon fixation cycle. Metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria can improve photosynthetic capacity as demonstrated by Berepiki et al. where expression of mammalian cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1) acting as an electron sink in Synechococcus PCC 7002 improved photosynthetic efficiency and increased electron flow rate by ~30%256. Using the same cytochrome P450 gene, Santos-Marino et al. engineered metabolic pathways for sucrose production and cytochrome P450 as a carbon and electron sink, respectively, into Synechococcus elongatus. Ultimately, this resulted in increased photosynthesis, and simultaneous expression of both sinks had an additive effect on photosystem I oxidation and photosystem II efficiency257. Another strategy to improve this cycle is by increasing the substrate concentration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCo) to improve carbon uptake. In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, one study found that genetic installation of additional bicarbonate transporters resulted in a 2-fold increase in carbon uptake and biomass258. Metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria can also be used to produce industrially relevant high-value chemicals and bioproducts such as biofuels. Some engineering efforts have been demonstrated in the model cyanobacteria species, S. elongatus PCC7942 and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, to produce ethanol, ethylene, isobutyraldehyde, and isoprene259–262. The biotechnologically relevant bacteria, Ralstonia eutropha (i.e., C. necator) has also been engineered by Dogutan and Nocera to capture CO2 to produce biofuels and edible biomass, in an artificial photosynthetic cycle that is much more efficient than those that are naturally occurring263.Microbial production of nutrients In addition to oxygen, microalgae can provide a sufficient source of proteins, carbohydrates, fatty acids, minerals, and vitamins required for a balanced diet264,265. These nutritional outputs can be further enhanced using synthetic biology approaches. Genome editing technologies for these marine species have expanded over the last 20 years, namely due to improvements in DNA sequencing, manipulation techniques and availability of genomic information266. Some of these methods and technologies include DNA delivery via conjugation, the generation of auxotrophic strains, and DNA-free or plasmid-based genome editing (e.g., using CRISPR/Cas9)267–270. Therefore, it is possible to create cell factories using metabolic engineering to alter the composition or nutritional output of these species271–273. For example, mutagenesis and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technologies have been used to modify the biomass composition of the model algae species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Irradiated mutant strains have been generated with double the starch content compared to the wild-type strain through increased expression of phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) and decreased expression of downstream enzymes in the glycolytic pathway274. C. reinhardtii has also been engineered to knock out the zeaxanthin epoxidase gene resulting in 47-fold increased production of the carotenoid zeaxanthin, which is important in the prevention of macular degeneration275, a concern facing astronauts during prolonged spaceflight276. Synthetic biology approaches are also being used to genetically engineer microorganisms for the production and long-term storage of nutrients as part of NASA’s BioNutrients projects277. Nutrient production and storage on long-duration space missions is a challenge as they can degrade over time. Therefore, this project aims to develop a system for on-demand microbial production of micronutrients on the ISS, whereby packages of dehydrated, edible yeast can be hydrated and consumed. In the first segment of the project, BioNutrients-1, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. boulardii species were engineered to produce antioxidants with genes for zeaxanthin and beta-carotene biosynthesis pathways, respectively277. The S. boulardii genome was also engineered to stimulate increased trehalose stores and with tardigrade-derived cytosolic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) genes, both resulting in increased tolerance to desiccation. Along with these strains, several other edible microorganisms are being tested for their storage and survival in stasis packages in the ambient conditions of the space environment. These include yogurt-producing and milk-coagulating bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, B. subtilis and Bacillus coagulans), yeasts (Kluyveromyces lactis and Komagataella phaffii Kurtzman) and C1-utilizing bacteria (Methylobacterium extorquens and C. necator). The production and stasis packages were delivered to the ISS and will be analyzed for growth and nutrient expression for a five-year duration. After 47 days, initial stasis package data showed no significant difference in the viability of bacteria stored on the ISS compared to ground controls278. These organisms are all attractive candidates for biological engineering to produce vitamins, therapeutics, or other useful enzymes for maintaining crew health. In addition to continued testing of the production of carotenoids, BioNutrients-2279 aims to further develop the bioproduction system from BioNutrients-1 by expanding the variety of probiotic products on the ISS to include yogurt and kefir and investigate the production of follistatin by the engineered yeast K. lactis279. The results of the BioNutrients project will provide invaluable information for the feasibility of using microbes as a platform for nutrient storage and production for long-term space travel.Engineered biomaterials In-space manufacturing and development can be challenging as necessary materials and supplies are not readily available and currently need to be transported or resupplied from Earth. Microbes offer a solution as they can be reprogrammed for the production of biologically derived materials (i.e., bioplastics, nanomaterials)280 to generate useful components such as plastics, adhesives, composites, and rubbers for structural space applications. Gel-based materials One material that would be beneficial to produce in situ beyond LEO is aerogels. Aerogels, first created by Kistler in 1931, are human-made, low-density solid materials with an interconnected porous network composed of 99.8% air, with the most common type being silica-based281. Photosynthetic organisms that can produce silica, primarily algae diatoms (e.g., Phaeodactylum tricornutum), are of interest for the generation of silica-based aerogels and have recently been incorporated into cellulose aerogel composites282,283. Aerogels are useful materials for space applications due to their low thermal conductivity, light weight, and high porosity284–286. To improve the habitability of other planets for humans and photosynthetic organisms, silica aerogels provide the benefit of allowing for the transmission of visible light for photosynthesis while simultaneously blocking hazardous UV radiation284. In addition, since aerogels are a thermally insulating material, they can raise surface temperatures through the solid-state greenhouse effect284. NASA is currently taking advantage of the thermal insulating properties of aerogels to protect spacecraft and rovers from the cold Martian surface temperature, such as for the Mars Pathfinder lander, Mars exploration rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) and Mars Science Laboratory mission (Curiosity rover)286. Aerogels have also been used as a method for capturing particles from space without damaging them, as demonstrated in the Stardust Mission286. Therefore, using a synthetic biology approach to generate aerogels from silica-producing organisms could be interesting to investigate further. Other gel-based materials can also be synthesized using synthetic biology. For instance, Kim et al. took advantage of the structural properties of synthetic spider silk287,288 and mussel adhesive proteins, which can act as biological adhesives289,290, to engineer E. coli with a spidroin-amyloid-mussel foot hybrid protein that can ultimately assemble into a hydrogel with high strength and underwater adhesion291. The hybrid protein consisted of a zipper domain from an amyloid protein, a flexible domain from spider silk, and a dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-containing mussel foot protein. This is a great example of how synthetic biology can be used to generate bacterial hosts expressing recombinant proteins with novel or desirable functions and properties, which can be applied to tackle specific manufacturing challenges in space. In addition, methods to spatially control the distribution of microbial cells into hydrogel structures have been developed using a Stereolithographic Apparatus for Microbial (SLAM) Bioprinting 3D printer292. Bioresins composed of synthetic polymers were used to contain the microorganisms and mimic extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are fundamental to biofilm formation in nature293. The power of this technology was demonstrated by printing engineered Caulobacter crescentus as uranium biosensors within this biomaterial using a uranium responsive promoter fused to GFP and measuring the fluorescence output292. This technology could enable genetic engineering of single strains, microbiomes, and biofilms to be used not only for biomanufacturing but also for biomining, biotherapeutics, and bioremediation.Polymer production and degradation Plastic materials continue to play a vital role in the manufacturing of spacesuits and spacecraft. Progress has been made towards the sustainable production of high-strength, biodegradable plastics in engineered microorganisms. Specifically, efforts have been made to increase the production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) or polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) in engineered cyanobacteria, Synechococcus294 and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803295,296. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 has been engineered with the PHA biosynthetic pathway of R. eutropha (i.e., Cupriavidus necator)296 or the overexpression of sigE295 to increase PHA and PHB production, respectively. Metabolic engineering of the shikimate pathway in B. subtilis or S. cerevisiae for the increased production of para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) has also been studied, which can act as a precursor for high-strength polymers (e.g., aramid fibers)297,298. Ultimately, these biologically derived materials can be used to manufacture parts or even 3D-print hardware in space299. To make in-space manufacturing and construction off-planet more sustainable, ISRU or recycling of existing material components to produce feedstock for new materials is necessary300. Microorganisms offer a solution to this problem as many can naturally degrade polymers for metabolic products. Black fungi, which are a diverse group of extremophilic melanized fungi, have been investigated for this application due to their demonstrated ability to hydrolyze synthetic polymers301). For instance, Aureobasidium pullulans, a black fungus, has demonstrated microbial deterioration of plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and dioctyl adipate plasticizers302. Knufia chersonesos, another black fungus, has been shown to completely break down the synthetic copolymer polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT)303. Secretome screening identified seven polyesterase enzymes that could potentially be involved in this observed polymer degradation, which lays the foundation for the possibility of further engineering of this biosynthetic pathway for more efficient degradation303. Therefore, this group of extremophilic organisms are promising candidates for plastic degradation, however, this process still needs to be investigated in simulated or spaceflight microgravity. Microgravity studies of K. cheronesos that analyzed the effects of simulated microgravity on the proteome and secretome found that scytalone dehydratase gene expression was upregulated in the wild-type strain and downregulated in a melanin-deficient mutant strain304. This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene melanin, which is believed to have protective qualities that fungi use to withstand the extreme conditions of space305. This suggests that Knufia species, and potentially other black fungi have the properties to withstand space conditions and are good candidates for plastic degradation in space. Since then, various other extremophilic fungi have been tested for their survival in space, through exposure to simulated Mars conditions306,307. These include 12 Chernobyl-isolated strains (i.e., Cladosporium, Acremonium, Beauveria, Fusarium, Trichoderma, Penicillium, Aureobasidium, Aspergillus and Apiospora), the black fungi Exophiala jeanselmei, and the microcolonial fungi Cryomyces antarcticus and Knufia perforans. Plastic degradation has also been investigated in extremophilic bacteria, for example Streptomyces thermoviolaceus, Geobacillus thermocatenulatus and Clostridium thermocellum308. As these extremophilic fungi and bacteria have been shown to withstand space conditions, thus they are promising candidates to use or engineer for plastic degradation in space. Ultimately, the capacity for manufacturing in space will be beneficial for long-duration space missions, reducing the need to bring materials as cargo or have them launched from Earth, and allowing for on-demand production of materials based on immediate need.Myco-architecture Astronauts venturing out beyond Earth’s protective magnetosphere will be exposed to hazardous radiation during deep-space exploration missions. This includes high-energy electromagnetic waves from our sun such as UV radiation, gamma, and X-rays or sub-atomic particles from the cosmos (electrons, protons, neutrons, and heavy metal ions), known as galactic cosmic radiation. These forms of radiation strip electrons from molecules resulting in protein or DNA damage through production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species309,310. The result is short-term or long-term health problems such as cancer, acute radiation sickness, radiation-induced cardiovascular disease, and neurological damage278. Developing a solution for passive radiation protection for astronauts will be a critical step towards sustaining long-term presence on the Moon and Mars. The average person on Earth is exposed to about 6.2 mSv of radiation over a period of a year, while the average astronaut on the ISS is exposed to approximately 144 mSv311. One year into a three-year mission to Mars, an astronaut would already have been exposed to some 400 mSv of radiation311,312. Due to the complex nature of space radiation, there is likely no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. Some proposed architectural concepts for radiation production include building below ground in lava tubes or piling meters of regolith outside of a structure313,314 and while materials like lead and aluminum may be effective, they would be costly to transport315. As a result, the search for innovative radiation shields will depend in part on biotechnology, which holds unique advantages such as suitability for ISRU, self-regeneration, and adaptability. By selecting model organisms such as extremophiles, that use radiation as an energy source, we can begin to understand their properties and refine testing for technology development. Fungi on Earth have been isolated in high-radiation environments, such as the contamination zone of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant316,317, inside the ISS317, and exteriors of spacecraft in LEO305. Analogous to phototrophy, fungi appear to perform radiosynthesis, using pigments known as melanin to convert gamma radiation into chemical energy318,319. Melanin has the capability to absorb electromagnetic radiation, resist acids, and perform powerful antioxidant activity allowing some fungi to thrive in the most extreme environments on Earth or beyond, including those with high levels of ionizing radiation320,321. Studies examining the survival rates of melanized and non-melanized yeasts with gamma radiation have shown that melanin-rich fungi were able to shield ionizing radiation at efficacies comparable to lead and twice as effective as charcoal, whereas the non-melanized strains lacked the capability to provide shielding322. This may not only be due to the presence of melanin itself but the spatial arrangement of it within the cell, as it was observed that in Cryptococcus neoformans, melanin arranged in a spherical shape, covering the inner surface of the cell membrane, resulted in superior shielding from radiation323, hypothesized to be due to the increase in scattering of incident photons318. Melanin is not the sole mechanism by which fungi survive radiation exposure. In a study using melanized yeast Exophiala dermatitidis, it was found that nutrient availability, culture density, metabolic state and DNA repair mechanisms were better determinants of cell survival after gamma radiation exposure than melanin324. Other mechanisms that protect fungi against radiation involve enzymes that remove reactive oxygen species or those that promote DNA repair, either through nucleotide excision or photoreactivation325, and various other secondary metabolites, such as the antioxidant pyranonigrin A326. Due to the ability of various fungi to withstand, thrive, and even attenuate space-relevant doses of radiation306,316,318,327–330 there is keen interest in their use for the development of radiation-resistant shields or structures305,330–332. Fungal mycelium, a filamentous network of hyphae, is a fibrous material that can be used as structural components for the construction of habitats, buildings, furniture, etc.333. Fungal mycelium as a construction material has attractive characteristics including self-healing potential, impressive compressive strength, flexibility, insulation, and hydrophobicity333. The use of mycelium-based materials and structures in space would be a sustainable, biodegradable option with demonstrated uses for generating textiles332 and as an alternative to plastic packaging. Haneef et al. used two edible and medicinal fungi, Ganoderma lucidum and Pleurotus ostreatus, to produce mycelium films composed of polysaccharides, lipids, protein, and chitin334. The fungi were grown on two different substrates; cellulose or cellulose with PDB, and the final composition and characteristics of the film differed based on which substrate they were exposed to334. This suggests that myco-architecture properties could be modulated simply by varying the growth substrate. Biocomposites combining fungal mycelium with cellulose plant fibers335 or with wood and cellulose nanofibrils have also been investigated336. Since they are living organisms, synthetic biology could be used to engineer fungi to secrete other useful structural components such as polymers, for even more complex structures. Indeed, CRISPR-Cas9 methodology has been used to create gene deletions in Paecilomyces variotii, a Chernobyl fungal isolate, and was used to identify the gene responsible for its radiation resistance337. This technology could be further employed to enhance various fungi for deep space applications, such as making them better suited for radiation shielding.Concrete production Another promising construction material to shield humans, plants and (possibly even) animals from the harsh Lunar and Martian environments is concrete. Concrete is a promising material for space applications as it is strong (it has proven to be the most durable material against natural disasters and extreme weather events), resistant to burns, rust and rot and could be made with engineered microbes and in situ resources. Concrete is composed of three main components: water, cement, and an aggregate (i.e., sand, gravel). Researchers have discovered that the use of human serum albumin combined with regolith from the Moon or Mars as the concrete aggregate can produce a concrete-like biocomposite that is made even stronger with the addition of urea338. Alternatives for cement, one of the main components of concrete, can be made using engineered bacteria to express recombinant or structural proteins, such as bovine or human serum albumin339 and spider silk340. This way, protein production and purification can be scaled-up and ultimately mixed with in situ regolith, rather than extracting them directly from the source. Microbes can further aid in the production of concrete through soil biocementation using microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP)341. This is a process wherein microorganisms precipitate calcium carbonate, the main component of limestone and cement, by urea hydrolysis or CO2-concentration341. For this reason, candidate microbes are typically highly urease-active bacteria, such as Sporosarcina pasteurii (formerly known as Bacillus pasteurii)342,343. One of the limitations of concrete is that it can often crack due to shrinkage. Incorporation of microorganisms into these structures can provide a sustainable solution for in-space construction but also a long-term biotechnological solution for concrete maintenance through crack remediation. Bacteria embedded in the concrete, resulting in what is often termed “living” or “self-healing” concrete, can repair cracks that form over time through the precipitation of calcium carbonate crystals344. This has been investigated using microorganisms including microalgae (Synechococcus and Spirulina)345,346, Bacillus347, and Deinococcus radiodurans348. Concrete is a harsh, alkaline environment (~pH 12) and therefore relies on hardy microbes tolerant of these conditions. The ability for Bacillus to form spores and its resistance to alkaline conditions makes this microbe a promising candidate for survival in the high pH concrete environment. Concrete remediation using MICP by spore-forming Bacillus species was demonstrated by Ramachandran et al.349 and later by Jonkers et al., who demonstrated that the spores remained viable for up to four months350. While this is a promising start, experiments need to be performed to determine whether bacterial spores can remain viable for longer durations. The B. subtilis gene cluster and molecular mechanism involved in calcium carbonate biomineralization have been identified351 and therefore could be used to engineer novel bacteria with enhanced self-healing capabilities or resistance to the concrete environment. Using extremophilic bacteria that can tolerate both the concrete and space environment to produce calcium carbonate may allow for the construction of Lunar or Martian structures with increased durability or radiation resistance. One such candidate is the cyanobacterium Synechococcus, a photosynthetic organism that can withstand extreme environmental conditions. Using Synechococcus PCC8806, Zhu et al. incorporated cyanobacteria into a mixture of hydrated concrete powder and sand. Results showed that 38% more calcium was precipitated in conditions containing cyanobacteria than in controls, and the microbial calcite layer on the concrete surface was thicker, more adhesive, and decreased water absorption by twofold345. More recently, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, was tested for incorporation in a sand-hydrogel scaffold352,353. Following inoculation into a scaffold of sand, gelatin and media, the microbial viability was analyzed in varying temperature and humidity conditions. While the scaffold was strongest at ambient conditions, cells were not viable after seven days, however at 50% or 100% humidity, 9% and 14% of the cells remained viable after 30 days, respectively352. Since desiccation appeared to reduce cell viability, another study analyzed whether changes in component ratios or addition of trehalose would allow for increased viability. They found that using a desiccation protectant like trehalose led to increased cell viability at ambient temperature without sacrificing the mechanical properties of the structure353. Maintaining cell viability of cyanobacteria in the concrete structure is vital for enhancing the crack-healing potential, which was shown to be promising in a recent study using S. elongatus and S. platensis at varying concentrations (i.e., 4, 8 and 12%)346. An alternative strategy to combat desiccation would be the use of a desiccation-resistant organism such as D. radiodurans, which is a polyextremophilic bacteria known for its resistance to radiation. Unlike some of the other candidate bacteria, D. radiodurans is non-spore forming and therefore has applications for low-temperature conditions348. D. radiodurans was shown to be viable for up to 28 days in concrete, providing significant crack healing and increasing the compressive strength of the mortar by 42% at room temperature and 38% at near-freezing temperatures348. Strategies enlisting microbes in combination with Lunar or Martian regolith provide a blueprint for ISRU for manufacturing strong, radiation-resistant structures that could further space exploration efforts and the possibility for human habitation on the Moon and Mars.Negative impact of microbes and mitigation strategies While microbes offer many benefits and biotechnological solutions for extended spaceflight and the development of sustainable habitats beyond LEO, they can also have a negative impact on space exploration. This can manifest as increased microbial pathogenicity, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of problematic genes, and biofilm formation which have direct effects on crew health and spacecraft integrity. Understanding how microbes respond to the space environment, will allow for mitigation strategies to be developed and implemented, to ensure successful long-duration space exploration. Pathogenicity Several studies have demonstrated that the conditions and stress of spaceflight can enhance microbial virulence or pathogenicity, as has been observed with many human-associated pathogens either grown or isolated on the ISS and/or in simulated microgravity conditions. Examples include Klebsiella pneumonia354, P. aeruginosa355, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium356,357, Serratia marcescens358, enterotoxigenic E. coli359, and Aspergillus fumigatus360. The presence of microorganisms with heightened virulence could increase the risk of crewmembers contracting infections, even more problematic due dysregulated immunity during spaceflight179. S. typhimurium grown under modeled microgravity (MMG)356 and in spaceflight357 showed increased virulence compared to ground controls as demonstrated by an increased mortality rate in a murine infection model. Similarly, S. marcescens358 and the pathogenic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus360, grown on the ISS or in simulated microgravity exhibited enhanced virulence compared to terrestrial strains and were more lethal in a Drosophila and zebrafish model, respectively. The specific mechanism responsible for increased microbial virulence in space conditions is still under investigation but genes with altered expression in-flight may contribute to this virulence response. These include biofilm-associated genes which were found to be upregulated in S. typhimurium (e.g., wca/wza genes for colanic acid synthesis, ompA, fimH) and bacterial motility genes which were downregulated361. In addition, transcriptional, and proteomic analysis of P. aeruginosa identified genes that were upregulated in spaceflight including virulence- and adhesin-associated lectin genes (lecA and lecB) and rhlA which is involved in biosurfactant production355. However, the most common factor contributing to space-induced virulence seems to be transcriptional regulation by Hfq, the expression of which was shown to be decreased under both low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) and spaceflight conditions in S. typhimurium361,362 and P. aeruginosa355,363. Hfq is an RNA chaperone and global transcriptional regulator responsible for controlling the expression of a large array of genes and is necessary for the virulence of several bacterial pathogens355. Consistent with previous studies, hfq was found to be downregulated in S. aureus grown in LSMMG, however, unlike previous studies the virulence potential was reduced364. Conversely, some studies have concluded that while microorganisms with pathogenic potential are present in these space environments, spaceflight conditions do not lead to increased virulence or microbial characteristics that would directly impact crew health365–367. For example, using a macrophage infection assay, O’Rourke et al. found that there was no significant difference in the virulence of Burkholderia species isolated from the ISS compared to Earth controls368. In addition, investigation of four common clinical pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and C. albicans revealed that they were less virulent in space regarding their ability to kill Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes369. Similar conclusions were drawn in the ISS experiment EXTREMOPHILES, where sequencing analysis and physiological tests were performed on microbial communities from several surfaces aboard the spacecraft370. Researchers proposed that while the ISS environment selects for bacteria with more natural resistance and tolerance to extreme conditions, it does not induce genetic or phenotypic changes that result in more extremophilic, or antibiotic resistant bacteria compared to a built, enclosed environment on Earth370. Indeed, a pan-genomic analysis of microbes from the ISS and built environments on Earth found that the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes present in ISS samples were also present in control samples, and that functional changes common to built environments do not have a direct impact on astronaut health371. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the impact of spaceflight on individual pathogenic microbes in built environments and, for many, it remains to be determined if the virulence phenotype depicted in their models will directly translate to mixed bacterial populations or lead to enhanced pathogenicity in humans. Therefore, assessing the microbiome within the host and continuing to elucidate the mechanism involved in potential spaceflight-enhanced virulence will be necessary. Although there is some debate regarding the increased pathogenicity of microbial populations in space, there is evidence of indirect health concerns caused by harmful biofilm formation370.Biofilms Microorganisms in the space environment, as on Earth, can exist in a planktonic (freely suspended) state, but more commonly form robust biofilms as a tactic for growth and survival. A biofilm is an assemblage of surface-associated microbial cells surrounded by an extracellular matrix of polysaccharides, extracellular DNA (eDNA), proteins, lipids, and other components, with a defined architecture372,373. Biofilm-associated organisms differ from their planktonic counterparts with respect to the genes that are transcribed, proteins that are translated and growth rate372. Although most bacterial biofilms are harmless, some threaten human health and safety and can be difficult to eradicate due to increased resistance to the immune system’s defenses, UV radiation, extreme temperatures, pH, high salinity, high pressure, limited nutrients, and various antimicrobials374,375. Environmental stressors are known to induce biofilm formation374 and spaceflight is one such stressor. The impact of microgravity on biofilm formation was investigated for the first-time using P. aeruginosa376, and later during two NASA-funded studies, Micro-2 and Micro-2A377. In these NASA studies, P. aeruginosa grown on the ISS displayed different biofilm characteristics compared to ground controls such as an increased number of viable cells, biomass, and thickness and a novel column-and-canopy shaped architecture377. However, this novel architecture was only observed in biofilms formed by motile bacteria, as non-motile strains produced flat structures similar to those seen with the ground controls377. In another early biofilm investigation experiment conducted in space, Burkholderia cepacia was grown in sterile water, tryptic soy broth (TSB), and an iodine solution (a disinfectant), for six days on stainless-steel coupons378. Results showed that bacteria grown in space, in sterile water, had a biofilm plate count (measured as CFU/m2) five times larger compared to ground controls, however, the space grown TSB population was one quarter of that on Earth378. Those grown in the iodine solution in space, also had a higher biofilm growth compared to the ground controls, suggesting increased resistance to disinfectants during spaceflight378. In addition, spaceflight conditions have been demonstrated to upregulate gene expression for the production of extracellular matrix proteins leading to enhanced cell aggregation compared to ground controls in C. albicans361. Differential expression of genes related to motility, which is important for the formation of biofilms, has also been observed in flight conditions379. Biofilms and biodeterioration Microbially influenced corrosion (MIC), refers to the deterioration of metals and nonmetallic materials due to microbial activity, most often due to biofilms. As biofilms increase in quantity more microbial-surface reactions occur, enhancing structural and/or functional damage, causing accelerated biocorrosion380. In a recent Microbial Tracking study (MT-1) of the ISS, the bacterial bioburden quantified from various surfaces was as high as 109 CFU/m2381. Some of the biofilm-forming microorganisms that were identified, Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, Bacillus, Penicillium, and Aspergillus have been implicated in MIC on Earth382–385 with Bacillus polymira, Penicillium rubens and Aspergillus sp. responsible for progressive destruction of a navigation window on board Mir386. Sphingomonas sp. and Methylobacterium sp. have not only been detected on surfaces but also in portable drinking water on the ISS387. Over the course of 15 years (from its launch in 1986 to 2001), 234 species of bacteria and fungi were identified onboard the MIR space station, with many exhibiting potential polymer biodegradation properties388. Biofilm growth has been observed in the Soviet/Russian (Salyuts and Mir), American (Skylab), and International (ISS) Space Stations. Aboard spacecraft, biofilms can jeopardize vital equipment and threaten astronaut health by corroding surfaces or clogging life-support systems including air and water purification systems, spacesuits, navigation windows and radiators368,389–392. Most notable on the ISS, is the microbial contamination and biofilm formation that occurs in the wastewater tank of the Water Recovery System (WRS), which is a part of the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) and used to process wastewater from various sources (i.e., urine, cabin condensate) into potable water for crew and other functions393. For future planned missions beyond LEO to the Moon and Mars, resupplying spare parts or support materials to repair the listed spaceflight systems would be impractical as missions could be in the order of years, in the case of a Mars missions, thus various strategies to control biofilms, especially in critical life support systems are essential394. Ways to detect, monitor and control biofilms are being explored, such as the current spaceflight BAC (Bacterial Adhesion and Corrosion) study. The aim of this study is to identify bacterial genes relevant to biofilm growth in space, examine whether the formed biofilms corrode stainless steel surfaces mimicking those in the ISS water system, and determine whether silver-based disinfectants can prevent or control extensive biofilm formation.Biofilms and astronaut health Biofilm formation is an important characteristic in the infectious disease process of microorganisms. It has been demonstrated that bacteria can genetically and physically modify their tolerances to LEO conditions, with one such mechanism being biofilm formation395–397. Human opportunistic pathogens that form or increase biofilms under simulated microgravity conditions or when grown on the ISS include E. coli, S. typhimurium, P. aeruginosa and Micrococcus luteus379,398. It has also been observed that many species of bacteria and fungi become more antibiotic resistant and pathogenic when exposed or grown in spaceflight conditions174. In cases of S. typhimurium17 and P. aeruginosa355, the observed increased virulence (discussed earlier in this review) was attributed to molecular and phenotypic changes consistent with biofilm formation. In the case of Klebsiella pneumoniae grown aboard the Shenzhou VIII spacecraft, the enhanced antibiotic resistance was associated with adaptations related to biofilm formation354,399. As biofilm formation can increase the risk of human illnesses, through harder-to-treat infections, biofilm properties under space conditions need to be well understood to enable safe, long-duration, human space missions. This is even more imperative considering the immune dysregulation of astronauts and lower efficacy of pharmaceuticals during spaceflight174.Positive impact of biofilms While biofilms can be detrimental to astronaut health and structural stability, they can be beneficial in areas such as plant protection, bioremediation, wastewater treatment, and corrosion inhibition, amongst others400. Thus, strategies for manipulating biofilms should not focus on complete eradication, but rather regulation, to promote the growth of beneficial ones while inhibiting the growth of harmful ones400. These beneficial applications of biofilms may also be extended to spaceflight. Ichikawa et al. developed a long-term life support system that uses an electrochemically activated biofilm reactor401. This system was tested for the removal of nitrate produced from biological nitrification and is an important process to allow for long-term survival of aquatic organisms in a closed system401. Results from this biofilm-electrode reactor study showed that neither ammonia nor nitrite accumulated, and nitrate could be suppressed to about 10 ppm401. Biofilms can also provide insight into how humans tolerate spaceflight. Biological dosimetry is an internationally approved method to perform an exposure assessment following a suspected radiation overexposure. In contrast to physical methods, which measure the actual dose, biological dosimeters measure dose effects, at the cellular level, when assessing the impact of radiation exposure on humans402. In the BIODOS project, four DNA-based biological dosimeters (phage T7, uracil thin layer, spores, and biofilms) were validated for their effectiveness in determining the biological hazards of environmental UV exposure (i.e., sunlight), and were shown to be reliable field dosimeters403. This same biofilm dosimeter was then used in a study by Rettberg et al. to determine the biological effectiveness of the UV radiation climate at different locations in the space station, with the aim of ensuring that astronauts had enough UVB to synthesize vitamin D404. Conclusions from this study showed that the amount of UV radiation inside the station was not sufficient for an adequate supply of vitamin D and that specialized UV lamps were needed to maintain healthy levels of Vitamin D for astronaut health404. Overall, more work on biofilm applications for spaceflight is needed to tease out the benefits biofilms may offer, while reducing any harmful properties.Horizontal gene transfer The ability for bacteria to survive or even thrive in the spaceflight environment, with potentially increased pathogenicity and biofilm formation, may be attributed to DNA transfer. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), also known as lateral gene transfer, is the movement of genetic material from one organism to another by means other than sexual reproduction or vertical transfer from a parent cell. This typically occurs through one of three main mechanisms: direct contact of microbial cells by a pilus (i.e., conjugation), natural DNA uptake from the environment (i.e., transformation), or introduction by bacteriophages (i.e., transduction)405–407. More recently, gene transfer agents and membrane vesicles are being recognized for their contributions to HGT as well408. HGT is central to microbial evolution because it allows microorganisms to acquire novel genetic material, which may confer a fitness advantage to adapt to or thrive within a specific environment22,409–411. Prevalence of HGT in the spaceflight environment In the sealed spaceflight environment, bacteria must adapt to extreme conditions including microgravity and cosmic radiation412, which could have an impact on the prevalence of genetic transfer. The three main mechanisms of HGT (transduction, transformation, and conjugation) were first investigated for their occurrence in space by Ciferri et al. during the Spacelab D1 mission (STS-61-A, 1986)413. They discovered no significant difference in transduction, inconclusive transformation results, and increased transmission of antibiotic resistance genes by conjugation in E. coli exposed to microgravity413. It was postulated that this increase in conjugation frequency could be due to a decrease in mating pair disruptions in microgravity compared to Earth gravity, as continuous cell-to-cell contact is required for conjugation to occur. Another spaceflight experiment was performed on the Discovery Mission (STS-63) where researchers concluded that transformation efficiency to E. coli was decreased in microgravity414. Later, during the Soyuz Mission 8S on the ISS, the Mobilisatsia/Plasmida experiment examined plasmid-mediated conjugation through triparental mating of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria415. They found that conjugation was increased in experiments between Bacillus thuringiensis strains (Gram-positive), while no trends were observed in conjugation experiments from E. coli to C. metallidurans (Gram-negative)415. This increase in conjugation efficiency could be attributed to the mechanistic differences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative conjugation, as Gram-positive bacteria facilitate contact between donor and recipient cells through surface adhesins rather than conjugative pili416. However, authors caution the drawing of conclusions due to failure to obtain transconjugants in some replicates of ground controls. Conversely, conjugation experiments performed using the same Gram-positive species (B. thuringiensis) in simulated microgravity showed that there was no significant difference in plasmid transfer frequency for a plasmid mobilizing itself (cis) or mobilizing a separate plasmid (trans) compared to standard laboratory conditions417. Most recently, Urbaniak et al. tracked HGT of two antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes by co-culturing of two species, Acinetobacter pittii and S. aureus, isolated from the ISS as part of the Microbial-1 tracking study381. The results indicated an approximately 100-fold increase of HGT in simulated microgravity compared to Earth gravity controls (1-g)418. Combined, these results indicate that HGT occurs in spaceflight conditions within and between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and is typically not hampered, and is more often increased, by spaceflight conditions.HGT and astronaut health The human gut houses a diverse microbial population with ecologically favorable conditions for HGT given its continuous supply of nutrients and consistent environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pH)14. Phylogeny-based research suggests that over the course of their evolution, more than half of total genes in the genomes of human-associated microbiota were introduced by HGT419. While HGT is a normal occurrence within the human microbiome, an increased number of transfer events passing AMR genes from commensal bacteria to opportunistic pathogens during spaceflight could cause changes in these microbial communities175. These transfer events have been investigated in Staphylococcus epidermidis, a bacterium normally present in the human epithelial microbiome, which harbors the methicillin resistance gene mecA on a mobile genetic element. HGT was found to be an important factor for the acquisition of mecA by the pathogen S. aureus, leading to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)420,421. Recent research has also demonstrated the transfer of AMR and virulence-associated genes from commensal E. coli to pathogenic E. coli422. The transfer of AMR genes can cause increased bacterial resistance and virulence, which could have significant health implications423,424 for astronauts due to their dysregulated immunity on long-duration space missions425. Numerous studies have shown that HGT is the common mechanism by which AMR genes are disseminated within an environment, leading to the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria426–428, which limits treatment options for bacterial infections. Some research has proposed that the increased virulence or pathogenicity observed in some organisms grown under spaceflight conditions is attributed to possible increased HGT in spaceflight conditions357,429,430. In a study comparing similar species from two extreme built environments, one on Earth (Concordia Research Station in Antarctica) and one in space (ISS), it was observed that 76% of the isolates from the ISS were resistant to one or more antibiotics tested compared to only 44% of the Concordia isolates429. This increased resistance amongst the ISS isolates could be attributed to the higher number of mobile genetic elements (involved in HGT) within their genomes compared to the Antarctic strains429. The reason for this increase in mobile genetic elements is unclear but it could be a response to the unique stressors of the space environment. Further, in a study published by Urbaniak et al. examining the ISS ‘resistome’, whole genome sequencing revealed AMR gene clusters in Enterobacter bugandensis isolated from the waste and hygiene compartment on the ISS. Further examination showed that these isolates shared AMR gene clusters with known pathogens from different genera which were not present in any Enterobacter species isolated on Earth430. The researchers proposed that these AMR genes may have been acquired through HGT, but further analysis is necessary to conclude this with certainty. Changes in HGT-associated gene expression were also identified in ISS-derived isolates of S. typhimurium during Space Shuttle mission STS-115, which exhibited enhanced virulence and increased biofilm formation in a mouse model compared to the ground control357. The expression of hfq, an RNA chaperone and negative regulator of the F plasmid-encoded tra genes, was decreased in spaceflight. TraJ is an activator of the tra operon, and hfq has been shown to specifically repress traJ expression by destabilizing its mRNA431. As a result, several tra genes were upregulated in response to spaceflight357. Mating assays performed in an hfq mutant showed an increase in protein levels of TraJ confirmed by immunoblotting as well as increased conjugation efficiency compared to wild-type controls431. Due to the multiple AMR genes found on the environmental surfaces of the ISS430 and possible enhanced HGT activity during spaceflight, further studies into HGT and the effect on crew health are is important to understand for the development of mitigation strategies432–434. In addition, further elucidation of differentially expressed genes and their effect on HGT could identify novel gene targets for modulating or reducing HGT in the space environment.HGT and biofilms As previously discussed, biofilms can be detrimental to spacecraft and astronaut health; thus, understanding the factors that can influence biofilm formation will be imperative for predicting, preventing, and mitigating spacecraft contamination. HGT may contribute to biofilms as their formation can be induced by conjugative plasmids that express factors to enhance cell-to-cell contact and pilus formation. Conjugative pili can act as adhesion factors as demonstrated by Ghigo who monitored biofilm formation on Pyrex slides submerged in cultures of E. coli K12. They observed that strains carrying a conjugative F plasmid (F+) formed thick biofilms after one day (2 × 1010 CFU/cm2), while plasmid-free strains (F−) only formed microcolonies (8 × 105 CFU/cm2)435. Conjugative pili specifically were shown to be a contributing factor to biofilm formation as strains carrying plasmids with mutations in the pilin gene, traA, were unable to form biofilms435. Reisner et al. confirmed Ghigo’s findings as the presence of the F plasmid pOX38 in E. coli led to the formation of mushroom-shaped biofilms with increased biomass, surface coverage and thickness compared to F- controls436. To further analyze the contribution of the pilus to this phenotype, the authors created plasmid mutants for several of the genes required for pilus synthesis: traQ, traX, traD, traS, and traT436. Mutants involved in pilus assembly and modification (i.e., traQ, traX) displayed a weak biofilm phenotype similar to the plasmid-free strain (traQ) or decreased biomass and thickness (traX), while those involved in DNA transfer (i.e., traD) displayed rapid confluent growth and tower-like structures436. In a different study performed with 403 natural E. coli isolates researchers observed biofilm formation in 56 isolates and of those, 89% contained conjugative plasmids437. These recipients of conjugative plasmids were able to induce biofilms to a greater extent than their plasmid-free controls437. Finally, one study validated that conjugative plasmids enhanced biofilm formation but concluded that this did not directly correlate with conjugation frequency for all plasmids tested, suggesting other factors may be involved438. Other studies suggest that conjugative plasmid-encoded fimbriae, biofilm-associated pili, and cell wall-anchoring proteins can also increase biofilm formation. Type III fimbriae encoded as accessory proteins on conjugative plasmids have been demonstrated to mediate cell–cell and cell-surface adhesion439, as well as increased biofilm formation440 in K. pneumoniae441. Further evidence of this was demonstrated in a uropathogenic strain of E. coli where Tn5 mutagenesis was used to identify biofilm-deficient mutants442. All Tn5 insertions were found to be within the type III fimbriae genes (mrkABCDF) encoded on the conjugative plasmid pMAS2027. This suggests that type III fimbriae were necessary for biofilm formation which was confirmed when this locus was cloned into biofilm-deficient mutants and was able to restore biofilm formation442. When analyzed in a space environment it appears that pili and fimbriae contribute to increased biofilm formation in the short term but decreased biofilm formation in the long term. In a spaceflight study, researchers compared biofilm formation of Acinetobacter schindleri over a short duration (15 days) and long-duration (64 days) from the Shenzhou-10 spacecraft and Tiangong-2 space lab, respectively443. They observed reduced biofilm formation after 64 days and following transcriptional analysis proposed that this reduction was potentially due to downregulation of the pil and algR genes associated with conjugative pili and alginate biosynthesis, or upregulation of genes involved in metal iron binding (as available iron increases biofilm formation)443. In another study analyzing Proteus mirabilis biofilm formation following short-term or long-term SMG, researchers found that long-term exposure resulted in downregulation of genes associated with fimbriae, impeding adhesion, and ultimately decreasing biofilm formation444. The rate of HGT amongst bacterial communities in biofilms is increased as it contains a diversity of bacteria, the structured extracellular matrix (ECM) provides the ideal environment to stabilize mating pair formation and bacterial contact for genetic exchange, and eDNA accumulates within the ECM allowing for natural transformation435,445–447. Lécuyer et al. analyzed the conjugative transfer of an integrative and conjugative element (ICE) between B. subtilis strains on normal media compared to biofilm-inducing media. Results indicated that conjugative transfer was increased by 100-fold and 10,000-fold on biofilm-inducing media using minimal media and rich media, respectively446. Conjugation experiments performed between S. aureus strains using donors harboring a mobilizable plasmid and the multi-drug resistant conjugative plasmid, pGO1 yielded similar results448. Conjugation was performed with standard filter mating or a cellulose disk static biofilm model and conjugation frequency in the biofilm-promoting conditions was found to be ~16,000-fold higher than in standard conditions448. Overall, HGT promotes biofilm formation which, in turn, promotes HGT transfer, and both can contribute to increased bacterial pathogenicity (Fig. 4). If HGT is increased under space conditions which can consequently lead to the production of more biofilms, the effect that biofilms have on spacecraft integrity and function could be even more severe during long-duration space travel if this feedback loop goes uninterrupted. Fig. 4. Interplay between bacterial HGT, biofilms, and virulence in space. Open in a new tab In microgravity, bacterial HGT can increase cell–cell adhesion, and production of eDNA and extracellular polysaccharides contributing to increased biofilm formation. Reciprocally, biofilms promote HGT as they contain high microbial diversity and an ECM structure allowing for increased cell aggregation, stable mating pair formation and eDNA accumulation. Both HGT and biofilms increase bacterial virulence through cellular adhesion and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance, and increased biomass and resistance to disinfectants, respectively. Created with BioRender.com.Harnessing HGT as a tool for genetic engineering Although HGT has the potential to negatively impact astronaut health and jeopardize spacecraft during long-duration space missions, conjugation machinery can also be harnessed as a tool for the development of novel mitigation strategies. Conjugation has been demonstrated within and between many species of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in a laboratory setting, and from bacteria to eukaryotic cells. Conjugative tool development for many of these species could have implications for their use in the space environment including those developed to target opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Enterococcus, Listeria, Staphylococcus449, Streptomyces450, and S. enterica451), or those that could be used to engineer useful strains such as probiotic candidates (e.g., Bacillus449, Bifidobacterium452 and Lactobacillus453) or extremophilic microbes (e.g., D. radiodurans454, yeast455 or algae267,268). When coupled with CRISPR/Cas technologies conjugation can be used for the modulation of microbiomes and as a method for targeted eradication of human pathogens on Earth. This has been demonstrated using a cis- and trans- conjugative plasmid encoding the I-TevI nuclease domain fused to Streptococcus pyogenes or S. aureus Cas9 (TevSpCas9 or TevSaCas9) targeting S. enterica451. This study demonstrated S. enterica killing efficiencies ranging from 1 to 100% following conjugation using 65 single or multiplexed sgRNAs, allowing for the ability to modulate bacterial populations based on the chosen sgRNA. Another study using a similar strategy and a trans-conjugative system has demonstrated specific bacterial killing and targeting of a plasmid-born carbapenem resistance gene in E. coli456. Other Cas nucleases can be used to target pathogens as well, including CRISPR/Cas13a-based antibacterial nucleocapsids, which have been shown to kill resistant E. coli and S. aureus species by targeting AMR genes457. CRISPR/Cas technologies can also be used to inhibit conjugation in human pathogens458,459, including species that have been isolated from the ISS such as K. pneumonia460, E. faecalis461, and Staphylococcus462. The biotechnological applications of CRISPR/Cas systems in space are extensive, from using Cas proteins to understand the biological impact of microgravity to detecting the presence of pathogenic bacteria or viruses, as demonstrated on Earth using Cas12 or Cas13 for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection463–465. The use of CRISPR/Cas systems for these in-space applications is feasible as genome editing using a CRISPR-based assay has been performed in S. cerevisiae onboard the ISS466. The mitigation strategies discussed here will require further testing and adaptation for space which could be carried out in synthetic human gut microbiomes467 or in simulated spaceflight biofilms394. However, these results indicate that harnessing the power of conjugation and CRISPR/Cas technologies could provide a promising strategy for detection of pathogenic bacteria, mitigation of HGT and modulation of human and environmental microbiomes in spacecraft.Mitigation strategies To minimize the health risks associated with extended spaceflight, it is critical that methods for preventing and treating spaceflight-induced illnesses be developed before astronauts embark upon long-duration space missions. Specifically, increased HGT, pathogenicity and biofilm formation by microorganisms in the space environment presents the need for highly effective antimicrobials and targeted solutions for use on spacecraft. Aside from traditional antibiotics468, the use of live engineered organisms, and the use of the conjugation and CRISPR-based strategies discussed above, other mitigation strategies have been investigated to inhibit HGT and the development of biofilms394. One well-studied method is antibacterial photodynamic inactivation employing the use of a photoactive compound which accumulates in target bacteria where it is illuminated to produce a cytotoxic reaction with oxygen resulting in cellular damage and bacterial death (reviewed in ref. 469). Additional examples of mitigation strategies include the use of specialized material coatings or surfaces (e.g., copper-based antimicrobial surfaces470,471, silver and ruthenium bio-deterrent surfaces472), engineered lantibiotics473, chemical water treatment, UV light, sound waves, and phenols474. Other promising antimicrobial materials include AGXX472, which was shown to prevent the growth of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus pathogens on the ISS, and sterilization using cold atmospheric plasma441. Some potential antibiofilm coating issues that need to be explored include the longevity and chemical stability of the coatings475. While several coatings give extremely promising results in the short term, their chemical and physical stability may diminish over time476. Regarding long-term space exploration, replenishing these antimicrobial coatings will prove challenging. The use of plant-based extracts is thus gaining in popularity for their antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties along with the added benefit of being able to harvest the necessary compounds during spaceflight, as needed390.Future outlook and summary Within the next decade, great strides will be made in space exploration with the combined efforts of NASA and other space agencies to reach the Moon and Mars, as well as the expansion of commercialized spaceflight. The Artemis missions will work towards establishing a lunar base camp by 2025 with the purpose of utilizing the Moon as a precursor to Mars exploration. These missions will involve long-duration spaceflight and prolonged extraterrestrial occupation, requiring further exploration of health risks and resource sustainability than what was needed for the decades spent in LEO on the ISS. This review has discussed the role of microbes and their beneficial or detrimental impacts on long-duration space missions as demonstrated in Earth-based simulated space environments or experiments conducted in spaceflight. Microbes heavily contribute to the success of our ecosystem on Earth and can therefore be repurposed for the space environment to help generate a sustainable habitat. We have summarized the advantageous properties of microbes in plant cultivation, wastewater treatment, solid and liquid waste reuse, and atmospheric revitalization. This review has also considered the use of microbial fuel cells to generate energy from waste, plant decay, and solar light conversion. Although more research is needed for efficient energy conversion in the space environment, we present microbial fuel cells as an ideal and possible future alternative for energy generation. We also examined the advantages of bioengineered microbes for in-flight therapeutics, increased production of nutrients and oxygen, and the creation or recycling of infrastructure materials. Most of these microbial technologies have been successfully demonstrated on Earth, but as suggested, should be further tested, and applied in the space environment. Microbes are ideal candidates to aid in human survival during long-term space travel due to their many beneficial characteristics, ease of manipulation, and microscopic size, allowing them to be easily stowed without the concern of added weight. In terms of health and safety risks, the possibility of increased microbial virulence and pathogenicity in spaceflight was discussed, as well as the detrimental effects of increased HGT and biofilm formation on astronaut health and equipment integrity. Suggestions were also made regarding mitigation strategies for further investigation, including antimicrobial metallic surface materials and coatings that prevent increased HGT or biofilm formation. This review has presented the vast contributions that microbes can make towards future crewed missions, human habitability and sustainability and hopefully encourages more space-related microbial research interconnected with technological development, to continue to safely advance deep space exploration in the upcoming decade.Acknowledgements The authors acknowledge funds from a NASA 2020 Space Biology (NNH18ZTT001N-FG2) grant (80NSSC21K0320) awarded to C.U.Author contributions A.K., S.B., E.S., A.L., and C.U. wrote the manuscript; A.K., S.B., and C.U. edited the manuscript; C.U. prepared the concept and outline of the manuscript and provided feedback to all authors.

    "introduction": "Introduction Humanity may be tempted to view the cosmos as a rich reservoir of infinite resources. However, the practical reality of space exploration tells a different story. The need for sustainability in space exploration, as well as the exploitation of space, is becoming more evident with the strengthening desire for the expansion of human activities beyond Earth-orbit, pursued by public and private sectors alike. When applied to space, the concept of sustainability has often been understood as \"ensuring that all humanity can continue to use outer space for peaceful purposes and socioeconomic benefit now and in the long term\"1. Until now, it mainly referred to the need to control, regulate, and remove space debris from low Earth orbit (LEO)2,3 and planetary protection (which promotes the implementation and development of the responsible exploration of the solar system, in order to protect the space environments and Earth)3. As humans aspire to venture into deep space, the definition of this concept shifts and expands, and the self-sustainability of mission operations becomes a critical aspect. Loop-closure, which indicates the recycling and the reuse of resources toward the establishment of a circular economy, could greatly enhance the sustainability of space exploration, and it is key not only to minimise the costs of resupply of resources from Earth but also for ethical considerations associated with space waste generation and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments4–10. The United Nations resolved that outer space activities should minimise impacts on the space environment, as well as on Earth, taking into account the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development11,12. The biggest impediment to progress on this frontier is the lack of deployable technologies enabling outposts, extended missions and, in the future, settlements, to sustain themselves through in situ resource utilization (ISRU) and maximised recycling of resources5. In addition to mechanical/physical/chemical approaches, biotechnologies broadly and microorganisms specifically will help enable long-term life-support and habitat systems’ performance (loop-closure), as well as ISRU, manufacturing and energy collection/storage6,7,13–17. Microbiological approaches can be self-sustaining with occasional monitoring and maintenance, owing to their resilience, and could overall require less energy than physicochemical approaches16. Here, we focus on the pivotal roles that microorganisms can play in the development of technologies for sustainable human exploration of deep space, considering two main aspects: (i) the requirement for mature biotechnologies and bioprocesses to allow near closed-loop operations of mission functions, such as life-support, to increase autonomy and sustainability; and (ii) the need to reduce supply chain dependency for the expansion of human presence in space. The approaches presented here are based on processes and technologies currently implemented on Earth at different technology readiness levels (TRL), which must be adapted to meet the specific requirements and challenges of the space environment. Selecting the most suitable bioprocess and most applicable microorganism for any given space application is non-trivial, as terrestrial technologies are rarely readily adaptable to the harsh conditions of space18. Therefore, extensive research and development are compulsory to increase TRL to the point where these technologies can be successfully implemented in space16. Finally, microbial biotechnologies aimed to increase the sustainability of space exploration may be translatable to Earth applications for advancement towards a circular economy, further supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)11,12.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions With this work, we aimed to advocate the urgency of sustainable approaches for human space exploration, and the essential role microbial biotechnologies could play in this. It has been discussed how microbial biotechnologies may support several processes that, in turn, can help decrease supply chain dependency (from Earth) on long-duration deep-space exploration missions to eventually enable human footholds and settlements across the solar system. In parallel, several of these microbially-supported processes may also help close the loop on LSS and other systems, which can preserve resources and extra-terrestrial environments. These two aspects, independently and together, enable space exploration in a sustainable fashion. To provide appropriate conditions for the maturation of named biotechnologies and to open the field to a wider community, research and innovation are needed. Preliminary studies should be supported in laboratories on Earth, simulation platforms, and in LEO, and full investigations in cis-Lunar space and on the Lunar surface. Augmenting existing space-based facilities to increase the capacity for space experiments, in terms of sample replicates and experimental conditions, should also be considered to improve the impact of the preliminary studies. Funding should take into account the high cost (and time) of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, on which these technologies will likely heavily rely. Finally, the potential of these technologies for terrestrial benefits has been discussed, with specific reference to the United Nation SDGs. If ultra-efficient approaches to sustaining human life and economic activity off-Earth can be adapted towards meaningfully solving problems on our planet, space exploration will have yielded a manifold return on public investments and will thereby become more sustainable not only technologically, but also politically. The debate about the public benefits of space travel and exploration is healthy and necessary, but in the field of sustainability, space advocates may now have an opportunity to win this debate for a generation.",

Finally, microbial biotechnologies aimed to increase the sustainability of space exploration may be translatable to Earth applications for advancement towards a circular economy, further supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)11,12.Habitat air bioremediation A spacecraft’s Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) manages water supply, atmospheric pressure and composition (O2, CO2, and inert-gas levels), temperature and relative humidity, as appropriate for human operations and conducive to comfortable living19. Carbon dioxide on the International Space Station (ISS) is currently scrubbed from the cabin air and converted in a Sabatier reaction to recover oxygen, while the by-product (methane) is vented into space. This has two drawbacks: (i) hydrogen is required as a substrate, production of which is energy intense; (ii) hydrogen and carbon are lost, requiring constant resupply. Recycling CO2 and/or methane back into the organic matter could improve loop-closure and preserve resources. Microbial bioremediation can support the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere in habitats, while also supplementing the generation of breathable oxygen20. The captured carbon may be upcycled again and reintegrated into the resource cycle, e.g., for the biomanufacturing of food/supplements. Alternatively, captured carbon may be sequestered for end-use (Fig. 1), e.g., for bioconcrete production or microbial-electrolytic carbon capture, as described later. Direct air capture of CO2 could reduce the need for energy-intensive auxiliary processes and shorten the recycling loop21. Researchers at the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM, University of Bremen, Germany) are exploring the application of cyanobacteria like Anabaena sp. PCC 7938 in a Martian context, taking advantage of its carbon- (photosynthetic) and nitrogen-fixing (diazotrophic) capabilities. Low carbon concentration in habitats or spacecraft yields a conversion efficiency two- to five-fold lower than with preconcentrated CO222. Hence, the most applicable approach will strongly depend on the mission scenario, in terms of size, extent and duration. Reversible carbon scrubbers23 combined with microbial conversion may enable a sustainable and near-closed process for deep space travel and exploration missions or initial human settlements24,25. Fig. 1. Graphical rendering of a microbial biotechnology-based life-support system in an agnostic space environment. Open in a new tab Microorganisms are included in all the functional compartments, including the ‘Human habitats and laboratories’ (i.e., human microbiome) and those that also require mechanochemical reactors. Up- and recycling of different resource streams and loop-closure is indicated by white arrows, supported by in situ resource utilization (coloured arrows), as applicable.Human waste processing and reclamation Human waste management poses a challenge for human space exploration, and proposed solutions commonly focus on how to compact, sterilise and dispose of human waste, rather than recycling it26. On the ISS, human waste is currently stabilised, dried and ejected from the station to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere27. This method is clearly not sustainable for long-distance missions, as it represents a sink of potentially useful resources. Solid human waste could instead be used as a feedstock for production of food and edible supplements, as well as nutrients/fertiliser for microbial or plant-based Life Support System (LSS) components (Fig. 1). Many physicochemical approaches to solid waste management, such as pyrolysis or incineration, are being proposed26. However, microbiologically supported processes could enhance human waste recycling by enhancing loop-closure. The European Space Agency (ESA) supported MELiSSA project (Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative) includes a series of interconnected bioreactors for LSS; it is a good example of how diverse types of waste-streams, including human metabolic end-products, could be upcycled using microorganisms5. Although anaerobic waste processing is usually considered less time-efficient than aerobic methods, it can achieve comparable degradation rates as physicochemical processes. A two-component system, which anaerobically converts liquid and solid human waste to protein- and lipid-rich microbial biomass for food production, has been developed28.Food production The ability to produce food in space will be of paramount importance to achieve sustainability and self-sufficiency on long-duration space missions and may be significantly enhanced by microbial biotechnology. For example, the plant microbiome will play a pivotal role in the success of crop production in space. As with the human microbiome, the plant-associated microbial community provides a multitude of benefits to the host, such as promoting plant growth, stimulating phytohormone production, controlling pathogens, regulating immune function, and alleviating abiotic and biotic stressors29. Symbiotic bacteria are also essential in solubilizing nutrients from the environment and converting them into bioavailable forms, and improving soil fertility29,30. Nitrogen recovery for food production can, for instance, be accomplished by microbial-mediated nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere, or nitrification of urine, mediated by synthetic microbial communities (see section ‘Human waste processing and reclamation’)31. For long-duration space travel, the use of agricultural probiotics should be considered to help grow robust, stable, and healthy crops in space. Agricultural probiotics are already used in farming on Earth as plant biostimulants32, as biofertilisers33 and for bioremediation to improve soil quality34. A better understanding of how the composition and function of the plant microbiome changes in spaceflight can help to customise probiotic supplements for space farming. For example, the concept of rhizobial inoculants is already in practice: seeds are inoculated with chosen strains of bacteria and fungi that can improve crop productivity and environmental sustainability35. Additional attributes of the inoculum geared towards spaceflight could also consist of bacteria/fungi that help maximise resource efficiency, thereby requiring less input for optimal growth. Algae and cyanobacteria may be cultivated not only for air revitalization, as discussed before, but also as a food source and to support plant growth9,20. For successful human outposts on the Moon or Mars, crews will have to produce their own food, taking advantage of local (in situ) resources, like regolith (see the section ‘Soil remediation’). Agricultural methods may include soil-based farming, hydroponics, cellular agriculture, etc. Creation of a greenhouse-like infrastructure, by the example of the ISS’ Advanced Plant Habitat36, and sufficient light, water supply, soil nutrients, and other necessary parameters for crop growth may enhance loop-closure. These and other resources could be obtained from other (biologically supported) LSS and ISRU compartments (Fig. 1).Pharmaceutical synthesis The idea of in situ manufacturing of drugs in space and taking advantage of microgravity has been around for decades37. The slower growth of crystals in the microgravity environment has enabled the discovery of new compounds38,39. The altered expression of microbial virulence and/or pathogenesis-related genes in space can elucidate the underlying mechanisms and assist with identifying new vaccines and treatments39,40. The space environment also brings physiological changes to astronauts during space flight39, providing accelerated models for aging and disease in drug discovery41. In the context of human exploration to the Moon or Mars, having a pharmaceutical foundry in space can remove the dependency on a supply of medicines from Earth and provide ways to manufacture drugs on demand39. Many of the carry-along pharmaceuticals will expire during a Mars-return mission of standard duration (1.5 or 2.7 years), or have reduced potency due to exposure to the space environment42, which tends to alter the active pharmaceutical ingredients and increases the concentrations of degradants or impurities42. To date, no studies have been reported on the stability of biological drugs such as monoclonal antibodies, versatile therapeutics capable of treating various space-relevant diseases, including osteoporosis, infections and inflammations. Microbes have long been used on Earth for the production of pharmaceuticals and high-value chemicals. Given the extreme conditions and limited resources in space environments, spore-forming bacteria (resisting radiation and/or desiccation), extremophiles and extremotolerants (resisting harsh environments), and photoautotrophs (surviving on inorganic carbon, e.g., cyanobacteria) have been sent to space to investigate their potential for application in biomanufacturing. Where necessary, microbes may also be engineered for the production of pharmaceuticals in space, which is not a trivial task, given the often complex biosynthetic routes to compounds of interest, as well as the diversity thereof. This also impacts downstream processing, given the stringent requirements for, e.g., purity, and because a one-fits-all solution rarely exists43. Computational and synthetic biology tools have been used to simplify the complicated metabolic pathways of conventional biotechnological drug production. For instance, acetaminophen, a versatile drug to treat infection and pain, was proposed to be synthesised by extending the shikimate (also known as chorismate) pathway of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 680344. Microbial recombinant protein expression may also be affected in space environments45. Some studies showed that protein production in Pichia pastoris, Escherichia coli, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae was higher in simulated microgravity than in Earth-gravity45. Given that the upcoming exploration missions will go beyond LEO, studies of space pharmaceutical synthesis are mainly focused on compounds or nutrients for countering microgravity-induced osteopenia and acute radiation syndrome43. Furthermore, there are efforts to investigate ways to compensate for the weakened immune system of astronauts during long-duration space missions, which can be addressed by the consumption of probiotics or prebiotics to maintain a healthy gut microbiome39,46. A source of microbes that is becoming increasingly relevant for pharmaceutical biosynthesis is the human gut microbiome. A recent metagenomic analysis from the Human Microbiome Project showed that human-associated bacteria encode the biosynthetic machinery to synthesise a vast array of secondary metabolites, such as small bioactive molecules (e.g. antibiotics). Many studies have investigated the changes in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome during spaceflight and in analogue studies47. The use of curated microbial communities (e.g. those that consist of non-pathogenic strains) could be considered to reduce the risk of infectious diseases48.Biomining Beyond LEO, the cost of the development of infrastructure increases dramatically. Therefore, a cost-effective supply of resources is required. One option is to harness in situ resources available at the destination through biomining44,49–51. Biomining, the use of microorganisms to extract valuable metals from crude minerals (e.g., regolith) and mine waste52, has seen extensive effort for adaptation to space applications50,51,53–56. Space biomining is primarily limited by economics: biologically mediated processes are often less expensive and less environmentally harmful than hydrometallurgical processes but can rarely provide the same high rates of separation. However, when taking into account the environmental and health costs associated with mining activities on Earth, biomining is already cost-effective for a variety of resources (copper, gold, nickel and cobalt extraction are all performed at a commercial scale)57. Chemolithoautotrophs (e.g., iron and/or sulphur-oxidizing microorganisms) could be suitable for biomining of sulphide minerals, occurring in a variety of settings on Mars or in asteroidal materials58. Microorganisms with other nutritional preferences (e.g., organotrophs), consortia, or bioengineering techniques could be used elsewhere: the Lunar surface is mainly composed of silica-saturated rocks, with a generally low sulphur content50,54. The need for organic nutrients to feed organotrophic microorganisms, which is limited by the availability of carbon in space environments, could be at least partially satisfied in a closed-loop system (Fig. 1). Microbial extraction of rare earth elements and vanadium from basalt54,55,58, and platinum group elements from L-chondrite meteoritic material has been demonstrated on the ISS55,56,59. However, further investigations are required to demonstrate the scalability of these systems, improve performance, and adapt the technology to other elements of interest (e.g., silicon, iron, aluminium). Water, oxygen, hydrogen as well as other critical molecules and elements could also be obtained via biomining50. These are essential compounds not only from the biotechnological perspective but indeed for any human activity. Knowledge of the ability to perform biomining under Lunar and Martian conditions is scarce or of theoretical character50,51 and efforts toward advancing bioleaching capability from extra-terrestrial regolith under space conditions, and toward the development of bioengineering and synthetic biology approaches, are critical to mature technologies. While prospecting is inherently not sustainable in the long run because of the inevitable depletion of resources (i.e., the ores, in the case of mining), biomining is generally considered more environmentally friendly than traditional mining because it avoids the use of toxic inorganic reagents. This also matters for extra-terrestrial applications, as it could reduce the need of auxiliary resources. It has been proposed that a biomining reactor could be added to a bioregenerative LSS50, hence contributing to loop-closure and ISRU (Fig. 1).Structural biomanufacturing: bioconcrete, myco-architecture Construction and maintenance of infrastructure beyond Earth is a necessary yet daunting task considering the scarce resource availability. Conventional methods of construction utilise large amounts of raw materials and require steady maintenance. To make construction and infrastructure maintenance more sustainable, prioritizing repair over a replacement will be essential and can be facilitated by biological self-healing materials. Concrete and cement are essential on Earth for construction and binding materials. While likely not being used to the same extent in space due to mass constraints, surface structures may to some degree require the binding of minerals for construction. Microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP), for example, is a biogeochemical process whereby microorganisms precipitate calcium carbonate (CaCO3)60, which can be used as a binding agent61. Additionally, MICP can also help in the bioremediation of toxic compounds and CO2 sequestration62,63. Microbial-electrolytic carbon capture could be utilised to sequester CO2, and it has been estimated that in the United States, 68 million tons of CO2 per year could be captured by this process64. Impact events pulverise regolith on planetary surfaces over time, forming extremely fine dust that can hinder equipment function and cause harm to humans65. Bacteria with MICP capability could be used to bind and harden regolith, consolidating the dust66. Similarly, cyanobacterial biofilms may be useful to control and bind fine regolith67. Byproducts of urea degradation-based MICP, such as ammonium and nitrate, could be further upcycled into a closed-loop system (Fig. 1). However, when the release of toxic byproducts must be avoided68, alternative microorganisms for calcium carbonate precipitation can be used (e.g., the methane-oxidizing bacterium Methylocystis parvus)69. Fungi-based biotechnologies may provide another opportunity to produce sturdy and resistant structures for space applications. Myco-architecture refers to the production of rigid structural components and surfaces using fungi. Fungal mycelia can form dense networks that combine with other materials, like e.g. regolith, to form mycelium-based composites. These are commonly used in various industries on Earth70. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has explored this solution for space exploration, by utilizing mycelia as a means to construct rugged furniture and habitat shells for the Martian and Lunar surfaces71. While research for space applications is in its infancy, the extraordinary resilience of fungi has even been a subject of investigation for radioprotection72. This potentially provides for in situ manufacturing of robust and self-regenerating structures, and engineered living materials, thus avoiding the need for excessive re-supply, and improving the sustainability of space exploration by mitigating the supply chain from Earth.Biological collection and storage of energy Energy collection and storage (e.g., of fuels) is a critical challenge in any remote environment and is particularly dependent on supply chain consistency. Certain anaerobic bacteria (so-called ‘electricigens’, e.g., Desulfuromonas, Geobacter, etc.) can reduce organic waste to generate electric current. Specifically, microbial fuel cells (MFC) utilise microbes to convert chemically bound energy into electricity73. Harnessing the reducing power of organic waste to generate electricity, MFC could be coupled with in situ flow-through waste remediation systems44. Such microbial systems can be categorised into dark-fermentation and photobiological processes, and they can use wet biomass from, for example, waste streams74,75. In a similar fashion, and quasi-opposed to MFC, microbial electrosynthesis (MES) can be used to convert electricity (back) into chemical compounds for e.g., energy storage, to bridge intermittent availability and demand76. Some evidence also indicates the possibility of generating hydrogen through nanoparticle production from Lunar regolith77,78. Hydrogen, methane, and other biofuels can also be produced from other in situ resources, such as water and inorganic carbon, photo- or lithoautotrophically (e.g., with cyanobacteria and various algae species), to generate stable energy carriers6,78. These could be liquid compounds with high energy density, such as butanediol, as means for storage of energy, to supplement or complement chemically derived bipropellants (hydrogen/methane and oxygen)76,78. In many cases, using electricigens, hydrogenic, methanogenic, and biofuel-producing microorganisms, waste products and in situ resources can be upcycled for conversion, collection and storage of energy with a higher yield and lower energy input than traditional mechano-chemical approaches.Recycling of electronics, plastics and other waste streams Currently, most efforts of developing highly efficient systems for loop-closure focus on recycling and upcycling of biological waste (e.g., food, black/grey/yellow water)79, while solutions for synthetic waste (e.g., electronic waste, plastics, consumables) are largely unexplored, and its current management is unviable in long-term missions26. Valuable metals (Fe, Cu, rare earth elements, Al, Si, Zn), including precious metals (Au, Pt and platinum group elements), as well as certain non-metals (Cl, P, N and even O) can be recovered from metallic structures and electronic devices with biology80. Reclaiming metals from electronic waste (e.g., computer components, switchboards, solar panels) could reduce the need for resupply and/or the more effortful sourcing from in situ resources through e.g., biomining (see section 'Biomining')50,54. Physicochemical processes are available; however, bioleaching technologies are considered more environmentally friendly and sustainable, in terms of costs and energy requirements81. The biochemical reactions implicated in these processes are analogous to those involved in biomining (see the section 'Biomining'), hence similar microorganisms and biotechnologies could be used to recycle electronic waste82. Plastics have become indispensable in our everyday life on Earth being used, for instance, in the construction, packaging and manufacturing industries. Beyond the common Earth-analogue applications, plastics, particularly those with high strength and durability, play a key role in supporting human activities in space, as components of spacecraft and spacesuits16. Most plastics are composed of organic polymers derived from non-renewable fossil fuels83. In an environment such as space, where fossil fuels are not available, recycling and upcycling of plastics will be important to (i) obtain feedstock for manufacturing to produce new consumables, (ii) re-use and recycle resources and thus close the loop on carbon-based feedstocks, and (iii) reduce waste disposal. Microorganisms have been shown to break down microplastics into metabolisable compounds that can support growth. The process, called biodegradation, offers exciting paths towards a circular bioeconomy83, and researchers at the UK Centre for Astrobiology (University of Edinburgh, UK) are exploring if these microbial processes could also be leveraged for waste recycling in space. Modern synthetic biology approaches could be used to programme microbial pathways/functions tailored to extra-terrestrial environments43,48, and use plastics as feedstock for upcycling and produce useful molecules84,85. Complementary to the microbial plastic biodegradation stands microbial production of plastics (e.g., bioplastics). Certain microorganisms can use a variety of feedstock, including CO2, CH4, or waste biomass, to produce bioplastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoates4. These processes will enhance sustainability by means of loop-closure, also because bioplastics are more readily biodegradable than fossil-fuel-based polymers. While not direct functions of life-support (as is the production of e.g., food, oxygen, water), all the foregone microbial processes can support LSS and vice versa, making long-duration spaceflight more sustainable. For instance, metals deriving from electronic waste could feed LSS compartments containing plants or microorganisms, which in turn can enhance processes directly linked to LSS (Fig. 1)50.Soil remediation Heavy metals and toxic compounds, such as perchlorates, could be removed from the Lunar and Martian regolith, allowing it to be used in soil formation for food production86. To this aim, the removal of toxic compounds is necessary due to the potential risk that their accumulation in plant tissues poses for the crew87. As described above (see the section 'Biomining'), microorganisms can bind and mobilise specific elements from Lunar and Martian regolith53,88. This, together with the removal of toxic elements and compounds (bioremediation), can improve the quality of regolith as a plant-growth substrate89, drastically reducing the required resources for the continued operation of plant-based LSS. Ultimately, this circular approach combines key elements of the processes described so far while enabling the production of the food needed to sustain humans off-Earth and minimizing the resources that need to be transported from Earth. Bioremediation may be supported with proteobacteria, e.g., Sphingomonas, as well as fungi, such as Penicillium spp.90,91. Genetic engineering of these organisms or other species could enable the removal of perchlorates (e.g., conversion of perchlorates into molecular chloride and oxygen87), as well as heavy metals, radioactive species accumulation and conversion92, acids, salts, and organic pollutants from extra-terrestrial regolith. As microorganisms catalyse very specific reactions, their use can result in highly efficient use of resources, while leaving non-toxic compounds unaltered. In addition, the energy requirements for bioremediation are generally lower than physicochemical alternatives such as heat-treatment to decompose perchlorates. The last point might be offset by required nutrients, which are not guaranteed to be available in situ. However, these could be derived from the other biological LSS compartments, including those described above. Current knowledge on the applicability of these processes in space is limited, therefore a better understanding of the mechanisms of bioremediation, microbial behaviour in the space environment and its potential for soil formation is desirable.Technology needs and future research A common technological denominator across most of the applications discussed thus far is the need to provide a controlled environment for the microbes and the functions they support or enable. Microbial processes depend on temperature, pressure, oxygen availability (or absence), pH, gravitational and radiation conditions, and other factors93,94. These aspects drive (i) the technological need for bioreactors tailored to providing the appropriate environment for specific processes, and (ii) the research needed to understand the effects of the space environment on these processes, to identify the conditions that maximise yield while minimising resources, engineering, and operational requirements. From a technological perspective, the importance of developing space-ready bioreactors is paramount. These will likely need to be specialised for the application they support, although commonalities among them are expected, which include: (i) providing and maintaining a controlled environment (temperature, pressure, liquid/gas composition), (ii) the ability for data collection in terms of the viability of the engineered system and the microbes therein, as well as its performance (including the chemical and physical status of the bulk medium and gas as applicable), (iii) the presence of interfaces to provide precursors, receive products, and attach downstream processing equipment, (iv) the ability for on-demand sample collection, (v) the ability to operate autonomously, at least partially; and (vi) the appropriate level of containment to adhere to planetary protection guidelines, which is particularly relevant for future Martian settlements (notably, closed-loop systems have been identified as a potential solution from this perspective)95. There will be differences depending on the application, for example, the surface area to volume ratio (SAVR), e.g., microbiologically supported direct air-capture of CO2 with photoautotrophs requires high SAVR to maximise the molar ratio of CO2 to microbes and cellular exposure to light96. In contrast, some pharmaceutical synthesis processes may be performed anaerobically and hence may not depend on SAVR39. Another aspect that may vary in culture volume: applications requiring high-SAVR will likely generate design drivers with serpentine-like culturing volumes, particularly for phototrophic organisms (similar to high-performance heat-exchangers), while low-SAVR applications may be enabled with simpler cylindrical tanks. This, in turn, may drive the systems’ need for fluid flow and mixing94. There are multiple other aspects to consider that can also impact process efficacy, which is especially applicable in bioreactors without stirring. Namely, these refer to mass transport phenomena, both intra- and inter-phase (liquid–solid, gas–liquid, gas–solid), which are dependent upon concentration gradients, temperature, etc., and must be considered during bioreactor design. Two technological needs relevant across applications will be data acquisition and sample collection, which in several cases will require gas/liquid/solid separation. On the Lunar and Martian surfaces, this may occur naturally owing to the presence of (partial) gravity. Operations taking place in microgravity (e.g., space stations and Mars-transit vehicles), however, pose a more challenging engineering problem. Of particular interest from a biological perspective would be the development of automated and real-time monitoring systems (growth and production rate, titre and yield, pH, pO2, as well as inputs and outputs), to allow characterization of system performance. A requirement for any microbial-based biotechnology is liquid water97, one of the most critical commodities for any long-term space activity. On the ISS, water is currently obtained by the Water Recovery System, which is part of ECLSS18: urine, humidity condensate, and human waste are recycled to generate potable water, through multiple processes including distillation, filtration, high-temperature catalysis and chemical disinfection98. This may not be sufficient on long-duration missions and, ultimately, settlements. Therefore, water recovery must be improved by a more complete loop-closure (Fig. 1). Moreover, additional water could be obtained from different locations on the Moon and Mars, or from asteroids, by mechanic/physical processes and/or biomining (see the section 'Biomining')50. Additional technology needs include the compartmentalisation of applications requiring a certain level of containment and isolation from others. Some applications like MICP, soil-bioremediation and myco-architecture may require exclusively dedicated compartments to protect the rest of the surface base from otherwise unwanted microbial communities and the regolith, which can have detrimental effects on crew health and equipment, while others may be performed in the same habitat-section (Fig. 1). Space conditions, especially the high levels of radiation, showed to induce mutations, changing the genotype of microbial systems in a way that the phenotype was impacted93. These could affect the reliability and robustness of microbial processes in space. Hence, technologies should include radiation shielding where appropriate, strict and frequent control of phenotypes and genotypes, as well as redundancies (e.g., protected storage of the primary inoculum as backup). Each of the categories described in the section 'Habitat air bioremediation' requires research to increase their TRL to nine, as described in Fig. 2. This research will, in turn, need dedicated platforms to perform research, for instance, access to microgravity and partial gravities40,99, as well as space radiation. Research needs, in addition to what is described in the former section, include biofilm control strategies. Biofilm formation has been a problem in every space station from Salyut 6 to ISS and can cause operational disruption of ECLSS equipment. This has been addressed via resupply from Earth, which will not be possible for long-term missions beyond LEO100. Engineered systems hosting microbial cultures for desired applications will be naturally exposed to the risk of unwanted microbial biofilm formation (i.e., fouling). Fig. 2. Schematic representation of current technology readiness level (TRL) for the considered biotechnologies. Open in a new tab Arrows indicate the specific research and development needed to advance the TRL of each technology. TRL is defined as indicated by NASA.This discussion motivates the following set of open research questions: (i) how can microbial biotechnology enhance the sustainability of long-term deep-space exploration missions and settlements, waste-recycling, while preserving extra-terrestrial environments? (ii) How can these processes be conducted while adhering to planetary protection guidelines? (iii) What technologies are needed to monitor process efficiency? For each application: (iv) what microorganisms (including genetically modified) and cultivation conditions optimise the process in the relevant gravitational and radiation environment? (v) What are the bioreactor, operational, and infrastructure requirements applicable to implementing the process? (vi) How do we collect, extract, and refine aliquots and final products obtained from the processes?Benefits for Earth Space exploration has always been a catalyst and testbed for the development of new technologies with applications on Earth (e.g., spin-off technologies)101. Space science’s implications for solving terrestrial environmental issues are not new, either. In fact, space activities are recognised by the United Nations as “essential tools for realising the achievement of the SDGs”11,12. Further, space-based technologies are indispensable for monitoring weather and vegetation patterns (natural as well as anthropogenic), deforestation, water resources, plastic pollution, carbon emissions and climate change. More specifically, space biotechnologies listed in this work could provide powerful tools to support a number of specific SDGs, including ‘Zero Hunger’ (Goal 2), ‘Good Health and Well-Being’ (Goal 3), ‘Clean Water and Sanitation’ (Goal 6), ‘Affordable and Clean Energy’ (Goal 7), ‘Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure’ (Goal 9), ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’ (Goal 11), ‘Responsible Consumption and Production’ (Goal 12), and ‘Climate Action’ (Goal 13)11,12. In the future, terrestrial environmental issues may be addressed by using space biotechnologies deliberately designed to enhance sustainability: systems that allow tight loop-closure and near-ideal circular operation of resources on a small scale are exemplary for application at a global scale. This kind of tangible public benefit is key not only for justifying space exploration to funding agencies and governments but for motivating scientists to invest their time and energy in space exploration at a time when multiple overlapping crises threaten the stability of our civilization and its ecological support systems. Space agencies and organizations are aware of the significant potential of this concept. An increasing number of calls for proposals are being launched with the aim of developing strategies to tackle environmental problems on Earth by using space resources. In 2021, ESA (i.e., ‘ESA Circular Economy Kick-Start Competition’)102 and NASA (i.e., ‘Orbital Alchemy Challenge’)103 launched relevant competitions. In 2022, the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) announced the ‘Beyond Plastics’ sustainability challenge (i.e., ‘CASIS Beyond Plastics’)104, with the motto “What if the next great discovery to improve our planet came from research off the planet?”. Notably, two out of the three finalist projects, including the winner, involved the use of microorganisms. Many of the microbial-based space technologies and strategies presented here have the potential to be transferred and pose benefits to terrestrial applications. Soil remediation techniques developed for application on other terrestrial bodies could be used to help react to soil pollution on Earth, identifying or engineering organisms suitable for cleaning up and degrading specific contaminants, as well as desertification, using desiccation-resistant organisms. Similarly, technologies or plant/microbial genetic engineering could be used to allow for crops to grow in less space with limited resources and deliver comparable or higher yields. Increased bacterial virulence in space flight has the potential to help identifying new targets for combating drug resistance37. On-demand space manufacturing of pharmaceuticals could result in simpler (e.g., fewer steps) yet flexible drug production and purification than on Earth. This may transform the complex and hardly sustainable production processes currently in use, replacing them with biomanufacturing and reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals, thus enabling access to critical medication in remote locations with scarce resources. Carbon-capture and -sequestration technologies will have direct transfer potential for Earth application in the effort to counteract climate change. In the energy transition, hydrogen is considered a cornerstone for seasonal storage, industrial processes, and general grid balancing. Biologically production of hydrogen, utilised in the context of space technology, could advance the discovery of production pathways for green hydrogen on Earth75. Research in bio-concrete synthesis and myco-architecture will enhance the ways how microorganisms can be employed for the construction and maintenance of infrastructure. Like space, Earth also has various extreme conditions. Engineering microbes for infrastructure maintenance can solve problems in remote and austere locations. Improved and highly efficient waste recycling, including but not limited to organic/biological, plastic/consumable, and electronic waste, for space applications could be translated back for Earth applications to tackle terrestrial waste management issues, landfill overflow and environmental pollution.Conclusions With this work, we aimed to advocate the urgency of sustainable approaches for human space exploration, and the essential role microbial biotechnologies could play in this. It has been discussed how microbial biotechnologies may support several processes that, in turn, can help decrease supply chain dependency (from Earth) on long-duration deep-space exploration missions to eventually enable human footholds and settlements across the solar system. In parallel, several of these microbially-supported processes may also help close the loop on LSS and other systems, which can preserve resources and extra-terrestrial environments. These two aspects, independently and together, enable space exploration in a sustainable fashion. To provide appropriate conditions for the maturation of named biotechnologies and to open the field to a wider community, research and innovation are needed. Preliminary studies should be supported in laboratories on Earth, simulation platforms, and in LEO, and full investigations in cis-Lunar space and on the Lunar surface. Augmenting existing space-based facilities to increase the capacity for space experiments, in terms of sample replicates and experimental conditions, should also be considered to improve the impact of the preliminary studies. Funding should take into account the high cost (and time) of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, on which these technologies will likely heavily rely. Finally, the potential of these technologies for terrestrial benefits has been discussed, with specific reference to the United Nation SDGs. If ultra-efficient approaches to sustaining human life and economic activity off-Earth can be adapted towards meaningfully solving problems on our planet, space exploration will have yielded a manifold return on public investments and will thereby become more sustainable not only technologically, but also politically. The debate about the public benefits of space travel and exploration is healthy and necessary, but in the field of sustainability, space advocates may now have an opportunity to win this debate for a generation.Acknowledgements Publication fees were covered by the United Kingdom Science and Technology Facilities Council under grant ST/V000586/1.

    "abstract": "Abstract While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth. Subject terms: Microbiome, Biofilms",
    "introduction": "Introduction Technological advances in recent years have enabled unprecedented insight into potable water microbiota using culture-independent methods (e.g., next-generation sequencing), revealing the vastly underestimated diversity in these communities. However, dynamic microbial interactions and phenotypes cannot be predicted based on sequencing information alone. Control of microbes in complex microbial ecosystems remains an important challenge, particularly with regard to the prevention and control of biofilms1–5. Changes that occur to the microbial ecosystem and the water-system integrity or function can impact the balance and population dynamics of resident microbiota, resulting in the release of pathogens or toxic materials to users and the environment. In addition to the health risks associated with microbial contaminants and their by-products, biofouling can cause materials degradation and systems’ failure6. Microbial observatories have been established in a wide range of habitats to facilitate prolonged investigations into microbial communities7. The International Space Station (ISS) has been designated as a microbial observatory to enable research into microbial responses to the unique environment of spaceflight8. The ISS is the largest human-engineered structure in space and has harbored over two hundred international crew members since 2000. The ISS serves as a valuable observatory to study microbial populations, especially since human and microbial influx is well-controlled and limited compared with most built environments. Sustainable life support is provided to the crew through regenerated air and water by the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)9. To ensure crew health and safety, NASA has diligently preserved ISS air, water, and surface microbial samples for years10,11. An important part of ECLSS is the water-recovery system (WRS), which generates potable water from recycled urine, wastewater, and condensation using multiple mechanical and chemical purification processes9,12–14. Even with these harsh treatments, including distillation, filtrations, catalytic oxidation, and iodine treatment13–16, a variety of microbes are routinely isolated from ISS potable water, and previous in-flight water analyses indicated that bacterial concentrations have exceeded the current ISS specifications of 50 CFU/mL for all potable water samples17–19. Sources of contamination are reported to be mostly derived from the environmental flora entrenched in the water system itself18. Historical monitoring of the NASA ISS potable water system indicates a stable microbial population consisting of relatively few microbial species11. The presence of microbes in ISS potable water is not surprising, given their presence in drinking water on Earth. For example, Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, and Rhizobiales recovered aboard the ISS are also commonly found in terrestrial potable or purified water systems3,10,11,20–24. Although ISS water contains the same types of microbes found in purified or potable water systems on Earth, there are several causes for concern. First, microbial ecosystems aboard the ISS are consistently exposed to the chronic stress of the microgravity environment, which is known to cause unexpected microbial responses that can impact human health (including enhanced virulence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance)8,25–35. Microgravity may present a selective pressure that could shape the adaptation/evolution of microorganisms. Second, many ISS potable water isolates are known to be strong biofilm formers23,24,36,37. This is of concern, as biofilms can be detrimental to the integrity and function of materials, inherently difficult to remove due to increased resistance to disinfectants and other antimicrobials, and present health risks to the crew38. Moreover, biofilm formation has been observed to increase in some microorganisms during spaceflight28,31. Finally, astronauts exhibit aspects of immune dysfunction during spaceflight and thus may be at increased risk for infection by both obligate and opportunistic pathogens11,39,40. Previous studies using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches have reported findings regarding microbial composition and concentrations in ISS potable water18,41–43. To better understand the factors involved in regulating how these ISS microbial populations can survive and maintain their ecosystem, it is important to augment these studies with functional phenotypic assessments of both individual and mixed cultures. As alterations in microbial characteristics can impact the integrity of onboard life-support systems and astronaut health, we determined whether ISS bacterial water isolates changed their interactions and community properties over time, which could potentially impact material integrity and infectious disease risks. In this study, we examined sixteen ISS potable water isolates collected over several years for a variety of phenotypes, including biofilm formation and susceptibility to various antimicrobials. Our results indicated that the microbes were resistant to multiple drugs, and combinations of antibiotics were necessary for complete elimination. When we investigated interactions between species, we found that interactive behaviors of some of the isolates appeared to depend on whether they were recovered during the same year or different years, suggesting that for these select organisms, a common history of coexistence may influence their interactions. In agreement with recent findings43, we also observed Burkholderia species subpopulations that displayed hemolytic activity, which highlights a key phenotype that could adversely impact human health (particularly for individuals with blunted immune systems) and should thus be further explored for prevalence and associated risk in drinking water both aboard the ISS and in public water sources on Earth.",
    "methods": "Methods Strains and culture conditions Strains were obtained from NASA and isolates were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and/or a biochemical identification using a VITEK system (BioMerieux) by the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). Lists of ISS potable water isolates archived by NASA from the US water system between 2009 and 2015 were obtained online44. Diversity assessments using these publicly available data were performed as described in the text. Potable water isolates used in this study from early (2009), middle (2012), and late (2014) years were provided by NASA JSC on commercial R2A media. Strains were cultured at 28–29 °C in a humidified chamber for 1–10 days on the following solid media: TSA (MP biomedicals, 091010717; Difco 214530), R2A agar (Becton, Dickinson, 218263), or mR2A agar (modified R2A agar; Teknova, R0005; Difco 214530). Prior to each experiment (for all strains), single colonies were isolated on R2A agar (1.5% agar) or mR2A agar (1.3% agar) from frozen stocks, and individual strains were cultured in R2A broth (Teknova, R0005) at room temperature to stationary phase of growth. The growth kinetics of each strain were determined at the beginning of the study to confirm that experiments were all performed at the same phase of growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) Strains were individually cultured to stationary phase in R2A broth, and 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared. We chose to test a range of antibiotic concentrations in our study based on literature searches, which included (a) concentrations commonly used for the same or similar organisms, including minimum inhibitory concentrations, and (b) reports that spaceflight can profoundly alter the antibiotic susceptibility of some bacteria86,87. Diluted and undiluted samples were plated on mR2A plates containing antibiotic(s) or NaCl at specified concentrations and incubated at 28–29 °C in a humidified chamber. The AST plates were monitored for approximately one week and bacterial survival was scored by the dilution showing microbial growth. Tenfold dilutions of a pure culture were plated on R2A agar media containing specific concentrations of antimicrobial compounds. Antimicrobial susceptibility was scored by testing the log decrease in bacterial survival, from 0 (no to <1 log-fold decrease) to 7 (7 or more log-fold decrease) (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) guidelines (Supplementary Fig. 5b)45. Energy-metabolism tests The casein-PR agar media used for metabolism testing contained 1% Casein (Sigma-Aldrich, 22090), 0.5% NaCl (S3014), 0.15% Bacto Yeast extract (BD, 212750), 0.008% Phenol red (PR, Sigma-Aldrich, P4758), and 1.3% agar. For additional supplements, 1% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S7903) or 1% lactose (Sigma, 61345) was added to the casein-PR media. Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies. Biofilm tests mR2A plates containing Congo red (Sigma–Aldrich, C6767) 100 µg/ml, or crystal violet 100 µg/ml, were prepared. Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies. For air–liquid-surface biofilms, individual strains were inoculated in 5 mL of R2A broth, standing and development of biofilms were monitored for eight weeks. Photos were taken at eight weeks post inoculation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and sample preparations Biofilms were developed on sterile glass cover slips in broth cultures of each individual strain for 24 h at RT. Cover slips containing pure culture biofilms were subsequently washed with sterile Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) to remove planktonic bacteria and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 20 mins, following gentle washing with cold DPBS twice. In a limited-light environment, the samples were stained with SYTO-9 green fluorescent stain (10 mg/mL, nucleic acid stain, Thermo Fisher Scientific S34854) for 15 min, Concanavalin A conjugated with Alexa Fluor™ 633 (500 mg/L, α-polysaccharide stain), Ethidium Homodimer-2 (EthD2, 1 mg/mL, dead-cell stain, Thermo Fisher Scientific E3599), or Fluorescent Brightener 28/Calcofluor White (0.7 mg/mL, β-polysaccharide stain, Sigma F3543) for five minutes. Biofilms were imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 LSCM with sequential scanning. Images were processed using Leica LAS software. Three to six stacks of horizontal plane images (1024 × 1024 pixels) with a z-step of 3 μm (the distance between the images) were acquired for each sample from two or more randomly chosen areas. Two independent experiments were performed. Fluorescence images were acquired with excitation at 405 nm (1.57%), 488 nm (4.98%), 514 nm (10.1%), or 633 nm (3.1%); emission filter DAPI (420–460 nm), FITC (498–545 nm), mCherry (565–610 nm), or Alexa-644 (648–700 nm) and gain 540.2 V (PMT), 60% (HyD), 65% (HyD), or 60% (HyD). Image scanning was carried out by sequential scanning with seq-1 (405-nm laser, pinhole 0.31), seq-2 (488 nm and 633 nm, pinhole 0.32), and seq-3 (514 nm, pinhole 0.31). Hemolysis test Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies, but instead used blood agar (BA; TSA with sheep blood, Fisher R01200). The plates were incubated and monitored for 15–72 h. Interspecies and mixed-species interaction testing Individual strains were grown in R2A broth as described above. Cells were centrifuged at 7000 r.p.m. for 15 mins and pellets were resuspended in fresh R2A broth to concentrate by 10 times. To assess interactions between designated strains, 10-µl samples of each isolate were dropped onto R2A agar (1.5%) at the same time at a distance close enough to allow for interaction but far enough away to avoid fusion of the droplets. Pairwise combinations of every strain in this study were examined. For mixed-species assays, samples were prepared in the same way to test the interaction between two strains. Equal volumes of the 10X- concentrated strains were mixed and 10 µl of these mixtures were drop-applied on R2A agar (1.5%). Different strains recovered from the same year were tested as one set to study mixtures of two species or all species. Incubation, monitoring, and recording were conducted as described above. Data collection, data analysis, and statistical analysis For most assays (except hemolysis and CLSM), microbial growth on plates was monitored over seven days by taking photos and recording observations every 1–2 days, mostly due to the varying growth speeds for different strains. All assays presented in this paper were repeated at least in triplicate. All statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 7 or Microsoft Excel. Mean value and error bars (standard error of the mean) are indicated.

    "results": "Results Population analysis of archived ISS potable water microbiota To investigate dynamic changes in microbial species in the ISS Water Recovery System since its installation in 200813, we analyzed a NASA-provided list of ISS potable water isolates preserved between 2009 and 201544. Seventeen different microbial genera and five unidentified Gram-negative rods were represented from the list, which included a total of 117 potable water isolates. All microbial genera are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Our analysis showed Burkholderiales, which includes the genera Burkholderia (mostly Burkholderia cepacia complex, Bcc), Ralstonia, and Cupriavidus, to be the predominant order comprising 63.25% of the total ISS water isolates, and Ralstonia pickettii to be the major species of the order (Fig. 1a–b). We further calculated the microbial diversity for each year by dividing the number of different species isolated in a year by the total number of isolates recovered in the year (Supplementary Table 2). We found that changes in the microbial species diversity inversely correlated with both Burkholderia and Ralstonia spp. over time, with the relationship more strongly associated with the former than the latter (Fig. 1c). The composition of microbial species was similar as the same species were frequently isolated each year (Fig. 1b). To investigate how microbial communities in the ISS potable water system may have changed over time, we selected different species of ISS water microbiota isolated in early (2009), middle (2012), and late (2014) years for further phenotypic analysis, to better understand targeted population shifts that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems (Table 1).

The complete list of antimicrobial compounds, tested concentrations, and test results is shown in Supplementary Dataset 1. All strains were resistant to multiple drugs at the concentrations tested for this study, most of which agreed with known–intrinsic drug resistance for the specific genus and/or species45. In particular, Bcc and Mesorhizobium isolates were highly resistant to most of the tested antibiotics. Ralstonia, Cupriavidus, and Bcc isolates showed similar trends in antimicrobial susceptibility. Sphingomonas sanguinis isolates were highly sensitive to vancomycin and many antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis. Methylobacterium and Bradyrhizobium showed similar drug-resistant trends with the exception of carbenicillin and chloramphenicol. Staphylococcus epidermidis was highly sensitive to most tested antibiotics. Many of the tested isolates were sensitive to NaCl concentrations over 1%, except Bcc and S. epidermidis (Supplementary Dataset 1). Fig. 2. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the ISS potable water isolates, pure cultures. Open in a new tab Summary of antimicrobial susceptibility of ISS potable water isolates is shown. Shading in gray scale from black to white indicates responses ranging from resistant to sensitive, respectively. The data from representative concentrations for selected antimicrobials, commonly used for Gram-negative bacteria, are shown. The complete results are in Supplementary Dataset 1. Preferred energy source of ISS potable water isolates We also examined whether carbohydrates or amino acids were the preferred energy source of the ISS isolates. We used agar media containing both casein amino acids and either sucrose or lactose, as well as the pH indicator phenol red. Most species appeared to prefer casein amino acids over either carbohydrate (indicated by the pink color around the colonies) (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, C. metallidurans and R. pickettii formed a wrinkled/rugose colony morphology, which is a common biofilm phenotype46, while R. insidiosa produced very smooth colonies (Fig. 3b). We thus decided to further examine biofilm formation of the isolates. Fig. 3. Characteristics of pure cultures of ISS potable water isolates. Open in a new tab a Core metabolic characteristics and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production. The media contains casein and phenol red with 1% lactose or 1% sucrose. Pink or yellow color indicates utilization of carbohydrate or casein amino acids in the presence of both. The colony phenotype on R2A media serves as control. EPS production is indicated with red colonies by 100 μg/ml Congo red. b Rugose/wrinkled colony morphology. Biofilm formation and production of extracellular substances Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), including extracellular DNA (eDNA), protein, and extracellular polysaccharides, are known to be fundamental components of biofilm growth47–50. To detect EPS production by the ISS potable water isolates, we grew bacterial colonies on media containing either Congo red or crystal violet to stain the extracellular substances. Media containing Congo red revealed that strains of R. pickettii, S. sanguinis, Bradyrhizobium spp., Mesorhizobium spp., and S. epidermidis were strong EPS producers with bright-red colonies (Fig. 4a). The crystal violet-containing agar also indicated biofilm formation. We thus further validated biofilm formation using an air–liquid-surface approach for Methylobacterium, Mesorhizobium, R. pickettii and S. sanguinis (Fig. 4b). All of the tested strains (except R. insidiosa) provided phenotypic evidence of biofilm formation with rugose/wrinkle colonies, EPS production, and/or air–liquid-interface biofilms. Fig. 4. Biofilm-formation tests. Open in a new tab a The R2A media contains 100 μg/ml Congo red (CR) or 100 μg/ml crystal violet (CV), or no dye addition (control).

Similar concentrations of bacteria, approximately 106–107 CFU, were plated. b The 8-week-old biofilms on air–liquid surface (arrow). Brightness and contrast of pictures were similarly optimized for clarity. Biofilm ultrastructure, composition, and cellular morphology We used confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to examine biofilm structures and production of the biofilm-related EPS (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 1). Single-strain biofilms were developed on sterile microscope glass cover slides. Live or dead bacterial cells, EPS compounds, and α- or β-linked polysaccharides were labeled by fluorescent dyes. The dyes used were SYTO-9 (green nucleic acid stain), ethidium homodimer-2 (EthD-2) (orange-dead cell stain), concanavalin A (ConA) (magenta α-linked polysaccharide stain), or calcofluor white (CFW) (blue β-linked polysaccharide stain). Figure 5 shows microscopic imaging of the bacterial spatial organization, biofilm-associated substances, and morphology of biofilms (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 1). The organisms show different biofilm patterns as evidenced by Con A, CFW, and viability staining. In particular, S. sanguinis, Ralstonia, and C. metallidurans formed large clustered biofilms (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 1). While Methylobacterium spp. grew 1–2 logs less in planktonic culture as compared with other species (Supplementary Fig. 2), they formed relatively thick biofilm layers on glass (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, our data showed that CFW appeared to stain individual bacterial cell surfaces, while ConA appeared to target biofilm matrix components. eDNA was also present in the matrix as evidenced by EthD-2 staining. Fig. 5. CLSM analysis of static biofilm on glass surfaces formed by ISS potable water isolates. Open in a new tab Single-species biofilms were developed statically on glass surface. Cells and EPS compounds were labeled by fluorescent dyes SYTO-9 (green), EthHD-2 (orange), CFW (blue), and ConA-alexa 633 (magenta). Biofilm structures and the composition were observed by CLSM. Scale bars indicate 5 µm. Identification of intraspecies variations and hemolytic Burkholderia species During the course of our studies, we observed that some ISS isolates of the same species, which were recovered in different years, showed evidence of possible intraspecies variation. Specifically, we found variation in the production of extracellular substances among select isolates of R. pickettii and S. sanguinis (Fig. 6a–b). Visual inspection of the 2014 R. pickettii isolates and the 2009 S. sanguinis isolates indicated that they may produce more EPS relative to the same species recovered in different years, suggesting intraspecies variation. In addition, we discovered hemolytic activity of select Burkholderia isolates. Specifically, the 2014 Burkholderia isolates displayed hemolytic activity, while the 2012 isolates did not (Fig. 6c). Surprisingly, our data revealed that the 2014 Burkholderia isolates exhibited unstable hemolytic phenotypes and variations in colony morphology (Fig. 6dright). Both hemolytic (α and β) and nonhemolytic (γ) colonies were simultaneously found on the same blood agar plate. In addition, both yellow and gray colonies simultaneously appeared on modified R2A (mR2A) agar and gray colonies were visibly more mucoid, suggesting varying mucus/pigment production among individual colonies (Fig. 6dleft). Moreover, the passaging of a single colony also produced colony variation, suggesting that this phenotype was not due to contamination but instead may result from an unstable phenotype. The different colony types shown in Fig. 6d were indistinguishable from each other based on 16 S rRNA gene sequencing (data provided by NASA), confirming that these morphologically distinct colonies were not contaminants. These differences in colony characteristics might be explained by recent sequencing data showing that the 2012 and 2014 Burkholderia ISS potable water isolates are different species43. The intraspecies differences in 2014 Burkholderia colony morphology and pigment were not observed using commercially available R2A, TSA, or LB agar media. Surprisingly, the 2014 Burkholderia isolates that exhibited β-hemolysis also tested positive for beta-galactosidase, urease, and D-trehalose, which are uncommon for Bcc strains (Supplementary Table 3).

The left picture shows yellow or pale-gray color colonies indicated with arrows. On the right image, the α-, β-, and γ-hemolysis are indicated with arrows demonstrating no-, weak-, and complete lysis of red cells, respectively. Interspecies interactions To better understand microbial relationships between different species that may occur in the ISS potable water system, we examined interactions between these species. Individual strains were spotted onto R2A agar directly adjacent to different species to assess the interactions between every possible combination of paired isolates (Supplementary Fig. 3). Interspecies interactions between the paired isolates over a progressive time course were rated as negative, positive, or neutral, based on migration of the cultures during growth in close proximity (Fig. 7). Neutral relationships were defined when two strains did not show a visible sign of interaction. Positive relationships were defined when one strain grew out toward and in some cases surrounded the other strain (Fig. 7c). We found two types of negative behaviors. For example, Methylobacterium and S. epidermidis were either killed or their growth inhibited by Burkholderia (Fig. 7a), while R. insidiosa grew away from Burkholderia (Fig. 7b). Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium, which are both slow-growing bacteria and thus could be potentially less competitive relative to faster-growing species, displayed no growth defect when interacting with most strains, thus showing neutral relationships (Fig. 7d). Fig. 7. Types of interspecies interactions and their progressive changes over time. Open in a new tab Three distinct interspecies interactions were observed in this study. Interaction criteria were based on migration of the cultures during growth in close proximity. Rows a and b show negative interactions, where one organism killed/inhibited (a, yellow arrows) or grew away from the other strain (b, red arrows). Row c shows positive interaction, where one strain grew out toward and in some cases surrounded the other (blue arrows). Row d shows neutral interaction, where no visible sign of interaction was observed between the organisms. The colonies on the left and right in each panel are respectively: a, 2014 Burkholderia spp. and 2014 Staphylococcus spp.; b, 2012 Burkholderia spp. and 2012 Ralstonia spp.; c, 2012 Ralstonia spp. and 2012 Sphingomonas spp.; d, 2014 Burkholderia spp. and 2014 Bradyrhizobium spp.We also observed a correlation between isolation year and the type of interspecies interaction between R. insidiosa and either S. sanguinis or Methylobacterium. For these strains in our study, species isolated in the same year exhibited positive relationships, while neutral relationships were observed when species from different years were cocultured (Fig. 8a–b). Fig. 8. Interspecies interactions may be influenced by the year of isolation. Open in a new tab a Distinct relationships observed between strains isolated in the same year but not in different years.

Red dotted lines highlight where Ralstonia spp. have grown out toward and surround the other species. b Correlation between the isolation year and interactions between different species exhibiting positive or neutral relationships. The years isolated are indicated above colonies, shown in the same color. Mixed-species colony biofilms We performed mixed-species colony biofilm assays to examine microbial multispecies behavior by combining different strains isolated in the same year and then plating these mixed cultures as a single colony. Strains were first individually cultured in liquid media, then equal ratios of either (1) two species from the same year, or (2) all isolates from each year (2009, 2012, or 2014) were mixed and spotted as a single colony onto R2A agar to compare the characteristics of colony biofilms. The morphologies of these mixed-species colonies were monitored for 10 days. Distinct phenotypes were observed for each mixed-species colony that resembled the dominant species in the mixture, but still differed from the morphology of the individual strains (Supplementary Fig. 4). S. sanguinis, C. metallidurans, R. insidiosa, or Burkholderia tended to exhibit relatively dominant phenotypes as evidenced by colony color or morphology. Methylobacterium spp., which previously showed growth inhibition when spotted next to a Burkholderia colony (Supplementary Fig. 3), did not show visible signs of growth in the colony when directly mixed with Burkholderia.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Microbial interactions within natural and artificial environments are typically investigated over a short period of time (hours to days). Longer-term interactions may only become evident during repeated observations of the same environment. Microbial observatories have been established in a number of environments51–53. These studies show how long-term changes may occur in a community due to alterations of environmental factors or the introduction of new species. In the current study, we used the ISS water-recovery system as a microbial observatory. Unique aspects of this environment include microgravity and the limited opportunities for the introduction of new microorganisms via crew exchanges and resupply missions8,54. Frequent microbial sampling is performed to mitigate risks to crew health and system performance10,11. While identification of isolates can provide useful information, phenotypic analysis enables an increased understanding of long-term effects of the spaceflight environment on microbial physiology and functional species’ interactions. In this study, we characterized antimicrobial susceptibility, single- and multispecies biofilm formation, EPS production, hemolytic subpopulations, preferred energy source, and multispecies interactions of sixteen ISS potable water isolates. Our analysis using archived ISS isolates showed that Ralstonia and Burkholderia, known biofilm formers, were the major bacterial genera between 2009 and 2016. Microbes interact with their neighbors in mixed communities and compete for space and resources in diverse environments55–59. Polymicrobial interactions between water isolates have been shown to affect biofilm functional characteristics, including drug resistance and morphology60–64. However, none of these studies were longitudinal in nature. Of particular relevance to our study, Thompson et al.64 recently conducted elegant experiments using six ISS potable water microbial isolates (including some of the same species used in our study) and showed the contribution of individual community members to the robustness of polymicrobial biofilm formation. Interestingly, this work found that some bacterial community members were necessary for polymicrobial biofilm formation and that predation by phage or predatory bacteria did not selectively remove specific bacterial community members. While microbial interactions may appear to be stable in short-term studies, this may not be true for longer-duration interactions65–67. Such microbial dynamics are critical to better understand the types of interactions and functional relationships that may occur in environments such as the ISS potable water microbial community over time. These studies highlight the importance of investigating the effects of long-term polymicrobial interactions in many different environments. Indeed, complex relationships between cohabiting species and a loss of antagonism over time have been frequently documented in longitudinal studies of pulmonary isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients68–71. A recent longitudinal study using Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates from CF patients suggested that the long-term development of metabolic divergence contributed to cooperative interspecies interactions that evolved over decades72,73. Using bacterial isolates recovered over time from the same ISS potable water system, we observed positive, negative, or neutral interspecies relationships with temporal dependent interspecies interactions observed between certain strains. As the section of the water system containing these isolates is downstream of a 0.2-micron water filter, introduction of outside contamination into the system would be highly unlikely8,15,74. Thus, the isolates collected at any given sampling timepoint may reflect bacteria that have coexisted for extended time periods. As these bacterial communities will have changed over time, isolates collected during a given year (e.g., 2009) may interact differently with bacteria collected from other years (e.g., 2012, 2014). Our data corroborate this possibility. Based on our findings, we propose a hypothetical microbial coevolutionary model to explain the observed interspecies interactions that might have developed during spaceflight (Fig. 9). We recognize that our results may be explained by other possibilities, including (a) the limited number of strains tested in this study, (b) potential phenotypic changes that might result from culturing the isolates in our laboratory as opposed to microgravity conditions in spaceflight, (c) different nutrient availability between the ISS water system and conditions used in this study, (d) strains isolated in later years might have been introduced via contamination into the ISS water system, and (e) species compared over different time periods were represented by different strains. Regardless, data from this study provide a foundation from which to advance our understanding of multispecies microbial communities and their functional interactions in the ISS potable water system over time, which could impact crew health and system performance. Fig. 9. Hypothetical microbial coevolution model associated with interspecies interactions of ISS water isolates indicates potential formation of new relationships over time. Open in a new tab A and B indicate different bacterial genera. It is worth noting that studies have reported reduced immune function in astronauts during spaceflight, which when coupled with alterations in virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance observed in some microorganisms during spaceflight, suggests an increased risk for infectious disease28,29,31,34,35,75–78. Our observation of hemolytic Burkholderia subpopulations that were multidrug resistant in ISS potable water samples confirms previous work by O’Rourke et al.43 and suggests an additional risk for opportunistic infections. We expanded on these previous findings43 by profiling the type of hemolysis (α, β, γ) in the Burkholderia isolates and discovered unstable hemolytic phenotypes, as well as variations in colony morphology and pigmentation. Interestingly, there was no clear association between hemolysis, mucoidy, or colony pigmentation. These same three phenotypes were unstable during our testing and produced the observed unpredictable colony variations during repeated passage on agar plates. To our knowledge, this is the first report that ISS Bcc isolates exhibit unstable hemolysis, mucoidy, and pigmentation phenotypes. These unstable pathogenic characteristics also occur in several organisms on Earth79–82. Notably, studies using microbial communities isolated from terrestrial water systems have shown increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and enhanced biofilm formation61. In addition, studies using microbial communities isolated from spaceflight water systems have shown increased biofilm formation and bacterial predation in multispecies biofilms31,61,64. Should the same phenotypic instability occur in spaceflight, it could present a challenge for detection and pose a risk for astronaut health. Further investigation is in progress to understand the role of microbial community interactions in antibiotic resistance, the virulence of select ISS potable water isolates, and potential underlying mechanisms. Our data also revealed distinct patterns of biofilm formation by the ISS potable water isolates that may be representative of the different species tested in this study. One potential explanation of the diverse biofilm patterns observed may be the different extracellular matrix components, as revealed by ConA and CFW staining, which stain α- and β-linked polysaccharides, respectively. We also observed that EthD-2, which does not penetrate the membrane of living cells, was observed at unexpectedly high levels in S. sanguinis, Ralstonia spp., C. metallidurans, Methylobacterium, and S. epidermidis. The increased EthD-2 signal in these cells may reflect eDNA in the biofilms, as has been previously shown with similar species47,83–85. We plan to conduct future studies to identify the mechanisms involved in these bacterial interactions and biofilm formation. Our longitudinal study provides a comprehensive phenotypic investigation of ISS potable water microbial isolates, focusing on functional characteristics of the different species alone or as multispecies consortia. As joint molecular and phenotypic analyses can provide a more comprehensive understanding of polymicrobial interactions and function than either approach alone, we are currently investigating molecular mechanisms that may explain some of the functional phenotypes that were observed for several of the ISS isolates in this study. By profiling the functional phenotypes of ISS isolates over a series of kinetic timepoints, the results of this study offer potential insight into how polymicrobial isolates may contribute to biofouling of onboard life-support systems and impact human health in space and on Earth.",

Copyright notice ID: 8421509 PMID: 34489467 Abstract While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth. Subject terms: Microbiome, BiofilmsIntroduction Technological advances in recent years have enabled unprecedented insight into potable water microbiota using culture-independent methods (e.g., next-generation sequencing), revealing the vastly underestimated diversity in these communities. However, dynamic microbial interactions and phenotypes cannot be predicted based on sequencing information alone. Control of microbes in complex microbial ecosystems remains an important challenge, particularly with regard to the prevention and control of biofilms1–5. Changes that occur to the microbial ecosystem and the water-system integrity or function can impact the balance and population dynamics of resident microbiota, resulting in the release of pathogens or toxic materials to users and the environment. In addition to the health risks associated with microbial contaminants and their by-products, biofouling can cause materials degradation and systems’ failure6. Microbial observatories have been established in a wide range of habitats to facilitate prolonged investigations into microbial communities7. The International Space Station (ISS) has been designated as a microbial observatory to enable research into microbial responses to the unique environment of spaceflight8. The ISS is the largest human-engineered structure in space and has harbored over two hundred international crew members since 2000. The ISS serves as a valuable observatory to study microbial populations, especially since human and microbial influx is well-controlled and limited compared with most built environments. Sustainable life support is provided to the crew through regenerated air and water by the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)9. To ensure crew health and safety, NASA has diligently preserved ISS air, water, and surface microbial samples for years10,11. An important part of ECLSS is the water-recovery system (WRS), which generates potable water from recycled urine, wastewater, and condensation using multiple mechanical and chemical purification processes9,12–14. Even with these harsh treatments, including distillation, filtrations, catalytic oxidation, and iodine treatment13–16, a variety of microbes are routinely isolated from ISS potable water, and previous in-flight water analyses indicated that bacterial concentrations have exceeded the current ISS specifications of 50 CFU/mL for all potable water samples17–19. Sources of contamination are reported to be mostly derived from the environmental flora entrenched in the water system itself18. Historical monitoring of the NASA ISS potable water system indicates a stable microbial population consisting of relatively few microbial species11. The presence of microbes in ISS potable water is not surprising, given their presence in drinking water on Earth. For example, Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, and Rhizobiales recovered aboard the ISS are also commonly found in terrestrial potable or purified water systems3,10,11,20–24. Although ISS water contains the same types of microbes found in purified or potable water systems on Earth, there are several causes for concern. First, microbial ecosystems aboard the ISS are consistently exposed to the chronic stress of the microgravity environment, which is known to cause unexpected microbial responses that can impact human health (including enhanced virulence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance)8,25–35. Microgravity may present a selective pressure that could shape the adaptation/evolution of microorganisms. Second, many ISS potable water isolates are known to be strong biofilm formers23,24,36,37. This is of concern, as biofilms can be detrimental to the integrity and function of materials, inherently difficult to remove due to increased resistance to disinfectants and other antimicrobials, and present health risks to the crew38. Moreover, biofilm formation has been observed to increase in some microorganisms during spaceflight28,31. Finally, astronauts exhibit aspects of immune dysfunction during spaceflight and thus may be at increased risk for infection by both obligate and opportunistic pathogens11,39,40. Previous studies using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches have reported findings regarding microbial composition and concentrations in ISS potable water18,41–43. To better understand the factors involved in regulating how these ISS microbial populations can survive and maintain their ecosystem, it is important to augment these studies with functional phenotypic assessments of both individual and mixed cultures. As alterations in microbial characteristics can impact the integrity of onboard life-support systems and astronaut health, we determined whether ISS bacterial water isolates changed their interactions and community properties over time, which could potentially impact material integrity and infectious disease risks. In this study, we examined sixteen ISS potable water isolates collected over several years for a variety of phenotypes, including biofilm formation and susceptibility to various antimicrobials. Our results indicated that the microbes were resistant to multiple drugs, and combinations of antibiotics were necessary for complete elimination. When we investigated interactions between species, we found that interactive behaviors of some of the isolates appeared to depend on whether they were recovered during the same year or different years, suggesting that for these select organisms, a common history of coexistence may influence their interactions. In agreement with recent findings43, we also observed Burkholderia species subpopulations that displayed hemolytic activity, which highlights a key phenotype that could adversely impact human health (particularly for individuals with blunted immune systems) and should thus be further explored for prevalence and associated risk in drinking water both aboard the ISS and in public water sources on Earth.Results Population analysis of archived ISS potable water microbiota To investigate dynamic changes in microbial species in the ISS Water Recovery System since its installation in 200813, we analyzed a NASA-provided list of ISS potable water isolates preserved between 2009 and 201544. Seventeen different microbial genera and five unidentified Gram-negative rods were represented from the list, which included a total of 117 potable water isolates. All microbial genera are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Our analysis showed Burkholderiales, which includes the genera Burkholderia (mostly Burkholderia cepacia complex, Bcc), Ralstonia, and Cupriavidus, to be the predominant order comprising 63.25% of the total ISS water isolates, and Ralstonia pickettii to be the major species of the order (Fig. 1a–b). We further calculated the microbial diversity for each year by dividing the number of different species isolated in a year by the total number of isolates recovered in the year (Supplementary Table 2). We found that changes in the microbial species diversity inversely correlated with both Burkholderia and Ralstonia spp. over time, with the relationship more strongly associated with the former than the latter (Fig. 1c). The composition of microbial species was similar as the same species were frequently isolated each year (Fig. 1b). To investigate how microbial communities in the ISS potable water system may have changed over time, we selected different species of ISS water microbiota isolated in early (2009), middle (2012), and late (2014) years for further phenotypic analysis, to better understand targeted population shifts that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems (Table 1).

The complete list of antimicrobial compounds, tested concentrations, and test results is shown in Supplementary Dataset 1. All strains were resistant to multiple drugs at the concentrations tested for this study, most of which agreed with known–intrinsic drug resistance for the specific genus and/or species45. In particular, Bcc and Mesorhizobium isolates were highly resistant to most of the tested antibiotics. Ralstonia, Cupriavidus, and Bcc isolates showed similar trends in antimicrobial susceptibility. Sphingomonas sanguinis isolates were highly sensitive to vancomycin and many antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis. Methylobacterium and Bradyrhizobium showed similar drug-resistant trends with the exception of carbenicillin and chloramphenicol. Staphylococcus epidermidis was highly sensitive to most tested antibiotics. Many of the tested isolates were sensitive to NaCl concentrations over 1%, except Bcc and S. epidermidis (Supplementary Dataset 1). Fig. 2. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the ISS potable water isolates, pure cultures. Open in a new tab Summary of antimicrobial susceptibility of ISS potable water isolates is shown. Shading in gray scale from black to white indicates responses ranging from resistant to sensitive, respectively. The data from representative concentrations for selected antimicrobials, commonly used for Gram-negative bacteria, are shown. The complete results are in Supplementary Dataset 1.Preferred energy source of ISS potable water isolates We also examined whether carbohydrates or amino acids were the preferred energy source of the ISS isolates. We used agar media containing both casein amino acids and either sucrose or lactose, as well as the pH indicator phenol red. Most species appeared to prefer casein amino acids over either carbohydrate (indicated by the pink color around the colonies) (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, C. metallidurans and R. pickettii formed a wrinkled/rugose colony morphology, which is a common biofilm phenotype46, while R. insidiosa produced very smooth colonies (Fig. 3b). We thus decided to further examine biofilm formation of the isolates. Fig. 3. Characteristics of pure cultures of ISS potable water isolates. Open in a new tab a Core metabolic characteristics and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production. The media contains casein and phenol red with 1% lactose or 1% sucrose. Pink or yellow color indicates utilization of carbohydrate or casein amino acids in the presence of both. The colony phenotype on R2A media serves as control. EPS production is indicated with red colonies by 100 μg/ml Congo red. b Rugose/wrinkled colony morphology.Biofilm formation and production of extracellular substances Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), including extracellular DNA (eDNA), protein, and extracellular polysaccharides, are known to be fundamental components of biofilm growth47–50. To detect EPS production by the ISS potable water isolates, we grew bacterial colonies on media containing either Congo red or crystal violet to stain the extracellular substances. Media containing Congo red revealed that strains of R. pickettii, S. sanguinis, Bradyrhizobium spp., Mesorhizobium spp., and S. epidermidis were strong EPS producers with bright-red colonies (Fig. 4a). The crystal violet-containing agar also indicated biofilm formation. We thus further validated biofilm formation using an air–liquid-surface approach for Methylobacterium, Mesorhizobium, R. pickettii and S. sanguinis (Fig. 4b). All of the tested strains (except R. insidiosa) provided phenotypic evidence of biofilm formation with rugose/wrinkle colonies, EPS production, and/or air–liquid-interface biofilms. Fig. 4. Biofilm-formation tests. Open in a new tab a The R2A media contains 100 μg/ml Congo red (CR) or 100 μg/ml crystal violet (CV), or no dye addition (control).

Similar concentrations of bacteria, approximately 106–107 CFU, were plated. b The 8-week-old biofilms on air–liquid surface (arrow). Brightness and contrast of pictures were similarly optimized for clarity.Biofilm ultrastructure, composition, and cellular morphology We used confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to examine biofilm structures and production of the biofilm-related EPS (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 1). Single-strain biofilms were developed on sterile microscope glass cover slides. Live or dead bacterial cells, EPS compounds, and α- or β-linked polysaccharides were labeled by fluorescent dyes. The dyes used were SYTO-9 (green nucleic acid stain), ethidium homodimer-2 (EthD-2) (orange-dead cell stain), concanavalin A (ConA) (magenta α-linked polysaccharide stain), or calcofluor white (CFW) (blue β-linked polysaccharide stain). Figure 5 shows microscopic imaging of the bacterial spatial organization, biofilm-associated substances, and morphology of biofilms (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 1). The organisms show different biofilm patterns as evidenced by Con A, CFW, and viability staining. In particular, S. sanguinis, Ralstonia, and C. metallidurans formed large clustered biofilms (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 1). While Methylobacterium spp. grew 1–2 logs less in planktonic culture as compared with other species (Supplementary Fig. 2), they formed relatively thick biofilm layers on glass (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, our data showed that CFW appeared to stain individual bacterial cell surfaces, while ConA appeared to target biofilm matrix components. eDNA was also present in the matrix as evidenced by EthD-2 staining. Fig. 5. CLSM analysis of static biofilm on glass surfaces formed by ISS potable water isolates. Open in a new tab Single-species biofilms were developed statically on glass surface. Cells and EPS compounds were labeled by fluorescent dyes SYTO-9 (green), EthHD-2 (orange), CFW (blue), and ConA-alexa 633 (magenta). Biofilm structures and the composition were observed by CLSM. Scale bars indicate 5 µm.Identification of intraspecies variations and hemolytic Burkholderia species During the course of our studies, we observed that some ISS isolates of the same species, which were recovered in different years, showed evidence of possible intraspecies variation. Specifically, we found variation in the production of extracellular substances among select isolates of R. pickettii and S. sanguinis (Fig. 6a–b). Visual inspection of the 2014 R. pickettii isolates and the 2009 S. sanguinis isolates indicated that they may produce more EPS relative to the same species recovered in different years, suggesting intraspecies variation. In addition, we discovered hemolytic activity of select Burkholderia isolates. Specifically, the 2014 Burkholderia isolates displayed hemolytic activity, while the 2012 isolates did not (Fig. 6c). Surprisingly, our data revealed that the 2014 Burkholderia isolates exhibited unstable hemolytic phenotypes and variations in colony morphology (Fig. 6dright). Both hemolytic (α and β) and nonhemolytic (γ) colonies were simultaneously found on the same blood agar plate. In addition, both yellow and gray colonies simultaneously appeared on modified R2A (mR2A) agar and gray colonies were visibly more mucoid, suggesting varying mucus/pigment production among individual colonies (Fig. 6dleft). Moreover, the passaging of a single colony also produced colony variation, suggesting that this phenotype was not due to contamination but instead may result from an unstable phenotype. The different colony types shown in Fig. 6d were indistinguishable from each other based on 16 S rRNA gene sequencing (data provided by NASA), confirming that these morphologically distinct colonies were not contaminants. These differences in colony characteristics might be explained by recent sequencing data showing that the 2012 and 2014 Burkholderia ISS potable water isolates are different species43. The intraspecies differences in 2014 Burkholderia colony morphology and pigment were not observed using commercially available R2A, TSA, or LB agar media. Surprisingly, the 2014 Burkholderia isolates that exhibited β-hemolysis also tested positive for beta-galactosidase, urease, and D-trehalose, which are uncommon for Bcc strains (Supplementary Table 3).

The left picture shows yellow or pale-gray color colonies indicated with arrows. On the right image, the α-, β-, and γ-hemolysis are indicated with arrows demonstrating no-, weak-, and complete lysis of red cells, respectively.Interspecies interactions To better understand microbial relationships between different species that may occur in the ISS potable water system, we examined interactions between these species. Individual strains were spotted onto R2A agar directly adjacent to different species to assess the interactions between every possible combination of paired isolates (Supplementary Fig. 3). Interspecies interactions between the paired isolates over a progressive time course were rated as negative, positive, or neutral, based on migration of the cultures during growth in close proximity (Fig. 7). Neutral relationships were defined when two strains did not show a visible sign of interaction. Positive relationships were defined when one strain grew out toward and in some cases surrounded the other strain (Fig. 7c). We found two types of negative behaviors. For example, Methylobacterium and S. epidermidis were either killed or their growth inhibited by Burkholderia (Fig. 7a), while R. insidiosa grew away from Burkholderia (Fig. 7b). Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium, which are both slow-growing bacteria and thus could be potentially less competitive relative to faster-growing species, displayed no growth defect when interacting with most strains, thus showing neutral relationships (Fig. 7d). Fig. 7. Types of interspecies interactions and their progressive changes over time. Open in a new tab Three distinct interspecies interactions were observed in this study. Interaction criteria were based on migration of the cultures during growth in close proximity. Rows a and b show negative interactions, where one organism killed/inhibited (a, yellow arrows) or grew away from the other strain (b, red arrows). Row c shows positive interaction, where one strain grew out toward and in some cases surrounded the other (blue arrows). Row d shows neutral interaction, where no visible sign of interaction was observed between the organisms. The colonies on the left and right in each panel are respectively: a, 2014 Burkholderia spp. and 2014 Staphylococcus spp.; b, 2012 Burkholderia spp. and 2012 Ralstonia spp.; c, 2012 Ralstonia spp. and 2012 Sphingomonas spp.; d, 2014 Burkholderia spp. and 2014 Bradyrhizobium spp.We also observed a correlation between isolation year and the type of interspecies interaction between R. insidiosa and either S. sanguinis or Methylobacterium. For these strains in our study, species isolated in the same year exhibited positive relationships, while neutral relationships were observed when species from different years were cocultured (Fig. 8a–b). Fig. 8. Interspecies interactions may be influenced by the year of isolation. Open in a new tab a Distinct relationships observed between strains isolated in the same year but not in different years. R, S, or M indicate R. insidiosa, S. sanguinis, or Methylobacterium spp., respectively. Red dotted lines highlight where Ralstonia spp. have grown out toward and surround the other species. b Correlation between the isolation year and interactions between different species exhibiting positive or neutral relationships. The years isolated are indicated above colonies, shown in the same color.Mixed-species colony biofilms We performed mixed-species colony biofilm assays to examine microbial multispecies behavior by combining different strains isolated in the same year and then plating these mixed cultures as a single colony. Strains were first individually cultured in liquid media, then equal ratios of either (1) two species from the same year, or (2) all isolates from each year (2009, 2012, or 2014) were mixed and spotted as a single colony onto R2A agar to compare the characteristics of colony biofilms. The morphologies of these mixed-species colonies were monitored for 10 days. Distinct phenotypes were observed for each mixed-species colony that resembled the dominant species in the mixture, but still differed from the morphology of the individual strains (Supplementary Fig. 4). S. sanguinis, C. metallidurans, R. insidiosa, or Burkholderia tended to exhibit relatively dominant phenotypes as evidenced by colony color or morphology. Methylobacterium spp., which previously showed growth inhibition when spotted next to a Burkholderia colony (Supplementary Fig. 3), did not show visible signs of growth in the colony when directly mixed with Burkholderia.Discussion Microbial interactions within natural and artificial environments are typically investigated over a short period of time (hours to days). Longer-term interactions may only become evident during repeated observations of the same environment. Microbial observatories have been established in a number of environments51–53. These studies show how long-term changes may occur in a community due to alterations of environmental factors or the introduction of new species. In the current study, we used the ISS water-recovery system as a microbial observatory. Unique aspects of this environment include microgravity and the limited opportunities for the introduction of new microorganisms via crew exchanges and resupply missions8,54. Frequent microbial sampling is performed to mitigate risks to crew health and system performance10,11. While identification of isolates can provide useful information, phenotypic analysis enables an increased understanding of long-term effects of the spaceflight environment on microbial physiology and functional species’ interactions. In this study, we characterized antimicrobial susceptibility, single- and multispecies biofilm formation, EPS production, hemolytic subpopulations, preferred energy source, and multispecies interactions of sixteen ISS potable water isolates. Our analysis using archived ISS isolates showed that Ralstonia and Burkholderia, known biofilm formers, were the major bacterial genera between 2009 and 2016. Microbes interact with their neighbors in mixed communities and compete for space and resources in diverse environments55–59. Polymicrobial interactions between water isolates have been shown to affect biofilm functional characteristics, including drug resistance and morphology60–64. However, none of these studies were longitudinal in nature. Of particular relevance to our study, Thompson et al.64 recently conducted elegant experiments using six ISS potable water microbial isolates (including some of the same species used in our study) and showed the contribution of individual community members to the robustness of polymicrobial biofilm formation. Interestingly, this work found that some bacterial community members were necessary for polymicrobial biofilm formation and that predation by phage or predatory bacteria did not selectively remove specific bacterial community members. While microbial interactions may appear to be stable in short-term studies, this may not be true for longer-duration interactions65–67. Such microbial dynamics are critical to better understand the types of interactions and functional relationships that may occur in environments such as the ISS potable water microbial community over time. These studies highlight the importance of investigating the effects of long-term polymicrobial interactions in many different environments. Indeed, complex relationships between cohabiting species and a loss of antagonism over time have been frequently documented in longitudinal studies of pulmonary isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients68–71. A recent longitudinal study using Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates from CF patients suggested that the long-term development of metabolic divergence contributed to cooperative interspecies interactions that evolved over decades72,73. Using bacterial isolates recovered over time from the same ISS potable water system, we observed positive, negative, or neutral interspecies relationships with temporal dependent interspecies interactions observed between certain strains. As the section of the water system containing these isolates is downstream of a 0.2-micron water filter, introduction of outside contamination into the system would be highly unlikely8,15,74. Thus, the isolates collected at any given sampling timepoint may reflect bacteria that have coexisted for extended time periods. As these bacterial communities will have changed over time, isolates collected during a given year (e.g., 2009) may interact differently with bacteria collected from other years (e.g., 2012, 2014). Our data corroborate this possibility. Based on our findings, we propose a hypothetical microbial coevolutionary model to explain the observed interspecies interactions that might have developed during spaceflight (Fig. 9). We recognize that our results may be explained by other possibilities, including (a) the limited number of strains tested in this study, (b) potential phenotypic changes that might result from culturing the isolates in our laboratory as opposed to microgravity conditions in spaceflight, (c) different nutrient availability between the ISS water system and conditions used in this study, (d) strains isolated in later years might have been introduced via contamination into the ISS water system, and (e) species compared over different time periods were represented by different strains. Regardless, data from this study provide a foundation from which to advance our understanding of multispecies microbial communities and their functional interactions in the ISS potable water system over time, which could impact crew health and system performance. Fig. 9. Hypothetical microbial coevolution model associated with interspecies interactions of ISS water isolates indicates potential formation of new relationships over time. Open in a new tab A and B indicate different bacterial genera.It is worth noting that studies have reported reduced immune function in astronauts during spaceflight, which when coupled with alterations in virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance observed in some microorganisms during spaceflight, suggests an increased risk for infectious disease28,29,31,34,35,75–78. Our observation of hemolytic Burkholderia subpopulations that were multidrug resistant in ISS potable water samples confirms previous work by O’Rourke et al.43 and suggests an additional risk for opportunistic infections. We expanded on these previous findings43 by profiling the type of hemolysis (α, β, γ) in the Burkholderia isolates and discovered unstable hemolytic phenotypes, as well as variations in colony morphology and pigmentation. Interestingly, there was no clear association between hemolysis, mucoidy, or colony pigmentation. These same three phenotypes were unstable during our testing and produced the observed unpredictable colony variations during repeated passage on agar plates. To our knowledge, this is the first report that ISS Bcc isolates exhibit unstable hemolysis, mucoidy, and pigmentation phenotypes. These unstable pathogenic characteristics also occur in several organisms on Earth79–82. Notably, studies using microbial communities isolated from terrestrial water systems have shown increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and enhanced biofilm formation61. In addition, studies using microbial communities isolated from spaceflight water systems have shown increased biofilm formation and bacterial predation in multispecies biofilms31,61,64. Should the same phenotypic instability occur in spaceflight, it could present a challenge for detection and pose a risk for astronaut health. Further investigation is in progress to understand the role of microbial community interactions in antibiotic resistance, the virulence of select ISS potable water isolates, and potential underlying mechanisms. Our data also revealed distinct patterns of biofilm formation by the ISS potable water isolates that may be representative of the different species tested in this study. One potential explanation of the diverse biofilm patterns observed may be the different extracellular matrix components, as revealed by ConA and CFW staining, which stain α- and β-linked polysaccharides, respectively. We also observed that EthD-2, which does not penetrate the membrane of living cells, was observed at unexpectedly high levels in S. sanguinis, Ralstonia spp., C. metallidurans, Methylobacterium, and S. epidermidis. The increased EthD-2 signal in these cells may reflect eDNA in the biofilms, as has been previously shown with similar species47,83–85. We plan to conduct future studies to identify the mechanisms involved in these bacterial interactions and biofilm formation. Our longitudinal study provides a comprehensive phenotypic investigation of ISS potable water microbial isolates, focusing on functional characteristics of the different species alone or as multispecies consortia. As joint molecular and phenotypic analyses can provide a more comprehensive understanding of polymicrobial interactions and function than either approach alone, we are currently investigating molecular mechanisms that may explain some of the functional phenotypes that were observed for several of the ISS isolates in this study. By profiling the functional phenotypes of ISS isolates over a series of kinetic timepoints, the results of this study offer potential insight into how polymicrobial isolates may contribute to biofouling of onboard life-support systems and impact human health in space and on Earth.Methods Strains and culture conditions Strains were obtained from NASA and isolates were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and/or a biochemical identification using a VITEK system (BioMerieux) by the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). Lists of ISS potable water isolates archived by NASA from the US water system between 2009 and 2015 were obtained online44. Diversity assessments using these publicly available data were performed as described in the text. Potable water isolates used in this study from early (2009), middle (2012), and late (2014) years were provided by NASA JSC on commercial R2A media. Strains were cultured at 28–29 °C in a humidified chamber for 1–10 days on the following solid media: TSA (MP biomedicals, 091010717; Difco 214530), R2A agar (Becton, Dickinson, 218263), or mR2A agar (modified R2A agar; Teknova, R0005; Difco 214530). Prior to each experiment (for all strains), single colonies were isolated on R2A agar (1.5% agar) or mR2A agar (1.3% agar) from frozen stocks, and individual strains were cultured in R2A broth (Teknova, R0005) at room temperature to stationary phase of growth. The growth kinetics of each strain were determined at the beginning of the study to confirm that experiments were all performed at the same phase of growth.Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) Strains were individually cultured to stationary phase in R2A broth, and 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared. We chose to test a range of antibiotic concentrations in our study based on literature searches, which included (a) concentrations commonly used for the same or similar organisms, including minimum inhibitory concentrations, and (b) reports that spaceflight can profoundly alter the antibiotic susceptibility of some bacteria86,87. Diluted and undiluted samples were plated on mR2A plates containing antibiotic(s) or NaCl at specified concentrations and incubated at 28–29 °C in a humidified chamber. The AST plates were monitored for approximately one week and bacterial survival was scored by the dilution showing microbial growth. Tenfold dilutions of a pure culture were plated on R2A agar media containing specific concentrations of antimicrobial compounds. Antimicrobial susceptibility was scored by testing the log decrease in bacterial survival, from 0 (no to <1 log-fold decrease) to 7 (7 or more log-fold decrease) (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) guidelines (Supplementary Fig. 5b)45.Energy-metabolism tests The casein-PR agar media used for metabolism testing contained 1% Casein (Sigma-Aldrich, 22090), 0.5% NaCl (S3014), 0.15% Bacto Yeast extract (BD, 212750), 0.008% Phenol red (PR, Sigma-Aldrich, P4758), and 1.3% agar. For additional supplements, 1% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S7903) or 1% lactose (Sigma, 61345) was added to the casein-PR media. Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies.Biofilm tests mR2A plates containing Congo red (Sigma–Aldrich, C6767) 100 µg/ml, or crystal violet 100 µg/ml, were prepared. Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies. For air–liquid-surface biofilms, individual strains were inoculated in 5 mL of R2A broth, standing and development of biofilms were monitored for eight weeks. Photos were taken at eight weeks post inoculation.Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and sample preparations Biofilms were developed on sterile glass cover slips in broth cultures of each individual strain for 24 h at RT. Cover slips containing pure culture biofilms were subsequently washed with sterile Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) to remove planktonic bacteria and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 20 mins, following gentle washing with cold DPBS twice. In a limited-light environment, the samples were stained with SYTO-9 green fluorescent stain (10 mg/mL, nucleic acid stain, Thermo Fisher Scientific S34854) for 15 min, Concanavalin A conjugated with Alexa Fluor™ 633 (500 mg/L, α-polysaccharide stain), Ethidium Homodimer-2 (EthD2, 1 mg/mL, dead-cell stain, Thermo Fisher Scientific E3599), or Fluorescent Brightener 28/Calcofluor White (0.7 mg/mL, β-polysaccharide stain, Sigma F3543) for five minutes. Biofilms were imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 LSCM with sequential scanning. Images were processed using Leica LAS software. Three to six stacks of horizontal plane images (1024 × 1024 pixels) with a z-step of 3 μm (the distance between the images) were acquired for each sample from two or more randomly chosen areas. Two independent experiments were performed. Fluorescence images were acquired with excitation at 405 nm (1.57%), 488 nm (4.98%), 514 nm (10.1%), or 633 nm (3.1%); emission filter DAPI (420–460 nm), FITC (498–545 nm), mCherry (565–610 nm), or Alexa-644 (648–700 nm) and gain 540.2 V (PMT), 60% (HyD), 65% (HyD), or 60% (HyD). Image scanning was carried out by sequential scanning with seq-1 (405-nm laser, pinhole 0.31), seq-2 (488 nm and 633 nm, pinhole 0.32), and seq-3 (514 nm, pinhole 0.31).Hemolysis test Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies, but instead used blood agar (BA; TSA with sheep blood, Fisher R01200). The plates were incubated and monitored for 15–72 h.Interspecies and mixed-species interaction testing Individual strains were grown in R2A broth as described above. Cells were centrifuged at 7000 r.p.m. for 15 mins and pellets were resuspended in fresh R2A broth to concentrate by 10 times. To assess interactions between designated strains, 10-µl samples of each isolate were dropped onto R2A agar (1.5%) at the same time at a distance close enough to allow for interaction but far enough away to avoid fusion of the droplets. Pairwise combinations of every strain in this study were examined. For mixed-species assays, samples were prepared in the same way to test the interaction between two strains. Equal volumes of the 10X- concentrated strains were mixed and 10 µl of these mixtures were drop-applied on R2A agar (1.5%). Different strains recovered from the same year were tested as one set to study mixtures of two species or all species. Incubation, monitoring, and recording were conducted as described above.Data collection, data analysis, and statistical analysis For most assays (except hemolysis and CLSM), microbial growth on plates was monitored over seven days by taking photos and recording observations every 1–2 days, mostly due to the varying growth speeds for different strains. All assays presented in this paper were repeated at least in triplicate. All statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 7 or Microsoft Excel. Mean value and error bars (standard error of the mean) are indicated.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (5.3MB, pdf) Supplementary Data 1 (24.1KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (434.2KB, pdf) Acknowledgements This study was funded by the Alfred P.

    "abstract": "Abstract Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have fascinated humankind since the earliest days of human history. It was only in the last century that humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts’ health in space. In this study, gene expression and correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health during space travel. Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay. Keywords: space biology, diagnostic assay, health, transcriptome, space flight",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction “Space: the final frontier.” [1]. Every fan of the American science fiction TV series Star Trek is likely to remember this cardinal line of the opening monologue. Indeed, space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have continually fascinated humankind; however, it was only in the last century that humankind finally took a solid step forward by sending astronauts into space and landing on the moon [2,3]. In the 21st century, humankind has made another great leap forward in space exploration: expediting the International Space Station (ISS) program [4], sending unmanned rovers to seek signs of life on Mars [5,6], and starting private space ventures [7,8]. In addition, NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is planning to send astronauts back to the moon in 2024 and to Mars in the 2030s [9]. Through all these endeavors, we have seen the twilight of crewed space missions going beyond our harbor (Earth) and into deep space. Space travel is challenging, dangerous, and full of uncertainty. Astronauts are under sustained microgravity and cosmic radiation. Prolonged exposure to microgravity and cosmic radiation has been shown to cause a series of health problems, including loss of muscle mass [10,11], reduced bone density [12,13], compromised immune responses [14,15], impaired renal functions [16], neurological system irresponsiveness [17,18], and development of cardiovascular diseases [19,20]. Furthermore, microgravity and cosmic radiation can cause several types of cancer, such as leukemia, likely due to compromised immunity [21]. However, studies under simulated microgravity also show that microgravity affects cell proliferation and apoptosis and can change cancer cells into less malignant phenotypes [22,23,24]. These studies indicate that the impact of microgravity and cosmic radiation on human health is profound, and it is unlikely that this impact is due to changes in one gene or a small group of genes. Therefore, genomic, transcriptomic, and/or proteomic studies are crucial to fully understand the effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation on human health. These studies can lead to the development of effective strategies to monitor, prevent, and/or alleviate the effects on human health caused by space travel. Approximately 12 years ago, NASA and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) undertook a microarray study on 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) who had a six-month mission at the ISS [25]. Terada et al. used qPCR to confirm that space flight changed gene expression in astronauts [25]. Several genes, including FGF18, ANGPTL7, and COMP, were upregulated and might play a role in inhibiting cell proliferation in hair follicles. However, they neither discussed the potential effects of the differentially expressed genes on the astronauts’ health nor provided any strategy to monitor these effects. Thus, in the current study, we reanalyzed this microarray dataset, conceptualized a method that could monitor the effects of space travel on astronauts’ health, and searched for potential intervention options.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Acquisition Microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708, which is the largest publicly available space gene expression dataset, was downloaded from the NASA GeneLab Database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab, accessed on 15 March 2021). It contains gene expression profiles for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) that stayed in the ISS between July 2009 and February 2013. For each astronaut, 2 profiles were collected at each of the three time points, Pre-flight (prior to departing for the ISS), In-flight (while staying at the ISS), and Post-flight (after return to the ground). 2.2. Data Processing Individual gene expression profiles were combined into three DataFrames: Pre-flight, In-flight, and Post-flight using the Pandas package (version 1.3.0) in Python [26]. These DataFrames were analyzed for possible outliers and verified for accuracy. Gene expression readings with null values were removed. Then, Agilent IDs in the data were mapped to gene names using the Ensembl BioMart database (https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview, accessed on 15 March 2021). 2.3. DEG Identification and Signaling Pathway Analysis Differentially expressed genes (DEGs: ∣log2FC∣ ≥ 3.00 and p < 0.05) were identified between the In-flight and the Pre-flight DataFrames using the DEGseq package (version 1.42.0) in R [27]. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) function was applied in the calculation. No DEGs were identified between the Post-flight and the In-flight DataFrames. The DEGs between In-flight and Pre-flight were then subjected to signaling pathway analysis using the InnateDB tool [28]. 2.4. Calculation of Gene Pair Correlation Matrices Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient matrices for the 3 gene expression DataFrames were calculated using formula r=Σ (xi−x_) (yi−y_)Σ (xi−x_)2 Σ(yi−y_)2. The correlation matrices were subsequently transferred to be visualized using an R platform. To analyze gene pair correlations for the signaling pathways, the expression profiles of the genes for the pathways were extracted from the DataFrames to produce the DataFrame subsets. For each signaling pathway, pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated and visualized as outlined above between the In-flight and Pre-flight subsets and between the Post-flight and In-flight subsets. Positive and negative correlations were represented in blue and red, respectively. Additionally, gene pair correlation coefficient differentials, ΔCC (In-Pre) = CCIn-flight – CCPre-flight and ΔCC (Post-In) = CCPost-flight – CCIn-flight were calculated by matrix subtraction between the In-flight and Pre-flight subsets and between the Post-flight and In-flight subsets. These were subsequently visualized with correlation difference plots with positive and negative ΔCCs shown in green and red, respectively. 2.5. Protein–Protein Interaction Network and Disease Network Constructions The BioGrid database [29] and DisGeNET database [30] were downloaded in March 2021 to create a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and extract the disease interaction information, respectively, for the DEGs. The networks were then constructed using Python and visualized using Cytoscape [31]. 2.6. Drug and miRNA Screenings The Drugbank [32] and miRTARBase [33] databases were also downloaded in March 2021 to extract the drug and miRNA interaction information for the DEGs. The networks were subsequently constructed using Python and visualized using Cytoscape. From these two networks, we identified potential drugs and miRNAs targeting the 32 genes that were identified to be used in a rapid RT2-PCR assay for space travel.",

Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) NASA and JAXA undertook Study GLDS-174: “Effects of a closed space environment on gene expression in hair follicles of astronauts in the International Space Station” between 2009 and 2013. Hair follicles were chosen for this study because they are the easiest attainable and noninvasive samples that are understood to be representative of most large-scale changes in the body [25]. However, Terada et al. only reported the expression of selected genes in this study and did not undertake further analysis [25]. To better understand how space travel affects astronauts’ health, we downloaded the microarray dataset (E-GEOD-74708) from the NASA GeneLab open data repository. The microarray dataset includes gene expression information for three stages: Pre-flight (6 months to 2 weeks before launch), In-flight (while staying in the ISS), and Post-flight (2 days to 3 months after returning from the ISS). We then analyzed the dataset for gene expression and gene pair correlation. Using cut-off criteria of ∣log2FC∣ ≥ 3.00 and p < 0.05, 218 DEGs were identified between In-flight and Pre-flight (Supplementary File S1: DEG_list.xls). The top 20 up- and downregulated genes are summarized in Table 1. However, no DEGs were detected between Post-flight and In-flight, suggesting that the astronauts may need a longer time than current guidelines for the body to adjust to the ground environment. Furthermore, astronauts have a much higher risk of developing various types of diseases than normal people and precautionary measures are critical to protect their health after returning to ground.

For example, the most up-regulated gene LIMCH1, encoding LIM and calponin-homology domains 1, activates the non-muscle myosin Iia complex, stabilizes focal adhesion, and inhibits cell migration [34,35]. Thus, the upregulation of LIMCH1 may explain observations that microgravity exposure can change cancer cells into less malignant phenotypes [22,23,24]. The second most up-regulated gene IER3 encodes Immediate Early Response 3 and regulates cell apoptosis [36], inflammation [37], and tumorigenesis [38]. Upregulation of IER3 has been observed in several types of cancer and may regulate cancer progression [39,40]. This implies another possible reason, other than radiation exposure, that increases the risk of astronauts developing cancer during a prolonged period of space travel. The most down-regulated gene, NFATC1, encodes Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells 1 and plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation [41], osteoclastogenesis [42], T-cell differentiation [43], lymphatic endothelial development [44], cardiac valve morphogenesis [45], and tumorigenesis [46]. The downregulation of NFATC1 may result in osteoporosis, immunocompromised conditions, and prostate cancer in astronauts during a prolonged space stay. The second most down-regulated gene, KIDINS220, encoding Kinase D Interacting Substrate 220, modulates the development and function of the nerve and cardiovascular systems [47,48]. The downregulation of KIDINS220 may contribute to the development of neurological disorders and cardiovascular diseases in astronauts. In summary, the large variation of the biological processes regulated by the DEGs provides a valuable resource of genes for us to develop a rapid assay kit (~20–30 genes) to monitor astronauts’ health conditions in space. However, it is noteworthy that the three genes reported by Terada et al., FGF18, ANGPTL7, and COMP, are not in the aforementioned DEG list because they failed to meet the cut-off criteria. 3.2. Gene Pair Correlations As mentioned above, the effect of space travel on an astronaut’s health is comprehensive and involves the regulation of many genes. It is also well-known that any biological, physiological, or pathophysiological change requires a delicate coordination of multiple genes. Therefore, we decided to carry out a gene pair correlation analysis for the whole genome (30,645 transcripts for 23,115 genes) among the Pre-flight, In-flight, and Post-flight expression profiles. As shown in Figure 1A, the genes are highly correlated in the Pre-flight, which is consistent with previous studies showing that gene expressions are correlated in normal human tissues [49]. Upon staying in the ISS for an extended period of 6 months, the genome significantly lost its regulation of the gene expression and gene coordination was scrambled (Figure 1B). Our previous studies have shown that loss of gene pair correlations is a hallmark of carcinogenesis and/or cancer progression [50,51,52]. Therefore, loss of coordination of gene expression, other than cosmic radiation and compromised immune system, is likely to be another factor that increases the risk of cancer development in astronauts. Analysis of the Post-flight dataset showed that returning to ground did not significantly improve genome regulation and coordination of gene expression (Figure 1C), implying that the effect of space travel on human health is more profound and longer lasting than currently thought. Extended care is necessary for astronauts to minimize the risk of disease development. As we progress towards crewed missions into outer space (for example, to the Moon and Mars) and other prolonged space stays, it is critical to develop rapid approaches to monitor genome regulation and establish corresponding protocols to alleviate the effects of space travel on human health. Another important question that needs to be addressed is whether the human body could establish a new “routine” for prolonged space stays and what this would look like in terms of astronauts’ health. We speculate that loss of gene expression coordination might also be responsible for other diseases/conditions astronauts experience, such as muscle loss and compromised immune system. Extensive further studies in space biomedicine and space pharmacology are warranted to prepare us for longer-term outer space exploration. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Gene pair correlations of the whole genome (30,645 transcripts for 23,115 genes) for 10 astronauts during Pre-flight (A), In-flight (B), and Post-flight (C). Positive and negative correlations are represented in blue and red, respectively. 3.3. Signaling Pathway and Disease Network of the DEGs Because DEGs are the most altered genes during a biological process, we conducted a signaling pathway analysis of the 218 DEGs between In-flight and Pre-flight to figure out which biological functions are regulated by these genes. The top 11 signaling pathways were identified to be signal transduction, immune system, gene expression, metabolism, metabolism of proteins, generic transcription pathway, developmental biology, metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, axon guidance, innate immune system, and disease (Table 2). In total, 48 genes were found to be involved in the regulation of these top 11 signaling pathways. Moreover, it is obvious that most of these DEGs are involved in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways, and that these signaling pathways regulate a broad range of biological, physiological, and/or pathophysiological processes. This analysis reconfirms that space travel imposes comprehensive effects on the human system rather than affecting an individual organ or tissue. Table 2.

As shown in Table 3, the top 20 disease/disorder conditions can broadly be divided into three categories: neoplasia/carcinoma, neurological disorder, and liver function, with the top three conditions being malignant neoplasm of the breast, colorectal carcinoma, and malignant neoplasm of the prostate. More DEGs were associated with tumor development than other diseases/disorders. In 2019, Reynolds et al. reported the effect of space radiation on astronauts’ death using a statistical analysis [53]. Of the astronauts who traveled to space between 1960 and 2018, 53 NASA astronauts have died, with 16 of those deaths (30.2%) being caused by cancer. Nevertheless, their study indicates that space radiation does not strongly impact the mortality of astronauts. This implies that weakened genome regulation (i.e., reduced gene expression correlation) is likely to be another key factor, in addition to compromised immune function, in causing tumor development in astronauts. However, these tumors may be less malignant or even benign [22,23,24]. Moreover, consistent with previous studies [54,55], our results showed that space travel significantly affects astronauts’ liver function and liver metabolism. Key genes identified from our analysis, such as GPT and UBA5, might serve as valuable monitoring biomarkers of astronauts’ liver function and even possible medical intervention points to protect astronauts’ health. Because liver is a major organ for drug metabolism, a systematic space pharmacology study is needed to establish drug profiles—including dosing, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), and even formulation—in preparation for future voyages into outer space. Space drug usage based on current information may be less effective or even detrimental to astronauts’ health. Table 3.

Design of a Rapid Assay for Space Travel Any biological or physiological process requires a delicate regulation of genes, including gene expression levels, interactions, and correlations. However, most genomics/genetic studies are focused on gene expression level rather than gene pair correlation. Although gene co-expressions and protein co-localizations are commonly studied in biomedical research, our research laboratory, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to apply gene pair correlation coefficient (a mathematical term) to describe and explain biological and medical questions [50,51,52]. Thus, to design a rapid assay to monitor astronauts’ health, we selected a set of genes with expression levels and gene pair correlations significantly altered by space travel. We calculated gene pair correlation coefficients (designated as CC) of the DEGs associated with the top 11 signaling pathways for the Pre-flight, In-flight, and Post-flight datasets, and analyzed the gene pair correlation coefficient differentials (designated as ΔCC) between the In-flight and Pre-flight and between the Post-flight and In-flight (Figure 2). The changes in gene pair CCs between the In-flight and Pre-flight datasets were obvious for every signaling pathway, except the generic transcription pathway. However, the changes between Post-flight and In-flight CCs were minimal. Thus, using ∣ΔCC∣ > 0.70 as a cut-off, we identified gene pairs with their correlation coefficients significantly altered between the In-flight and Pre-flight datasets and summarized them in Table 4. These gene pairs were then classified into four categories based on changes in correlation coefficients: Category 1—positive to more/less positive (highlighted in blue), Category 2—positive to negative (highlighted in green), Category 3—negative to positive (highlighted in brown), and Category 4—negative to more/less negative (highlighted in red). It is noteworthy that Categories 2 and 3 contained more gene pairs than Categories 1 and 4, implying that many genes lost their coordination and even started counteractive processes in space. This observation supports previous studies that found that spaceflight significantly affects gene expression and homeostasis [56]. This dramatic change in gene expression coordination is thought to affect normal biological and physiological functions in the human body and is likely detrimental to astronauts’ health. Figure 2.

The top 11 signaling pathways are signal transduction, immune system, gene expression, metabolism, metabolism of proteins, generic transcription pathway, developmental biology, metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, axon guidance, innate immune system, and disease.

To increase the sensitivity of the assay for space travel, it is rational to only include gene pairs with correlations changing from strong to weak, weak to strong, or strong to opposite strong with ∣ΔCC∣ > 0.70. Using this guideline, we identified the following gene pairs: 12 gene pairs from signal transduction, 11 gene pairs from immune system, 2 gene pairs from gene expression, 5 gene pairs from metabolism, 6 gene pairs from metabolism of proteins, 1 gene pair from developmental biology, 2 gene pairs from metabolism of lipids and lipoprotein, 1 gene pair from axon guidance, 2 gene pairs from innate immune system, and 1 gene pair from disease (Table 5). In total, 32 genes were selected, and they are AARS2, ACSL4, ATF2, BIRC2, CCL2, CCNC, CHMP4C, COL4A4, CREB1, CRHR1, CTNNBIP1, DPP4, EIF4E2, GNE, GPT, IL7, KIDINS220, MAGT1, NDUFA1, NFATC1, PCSK1, PDPK1, PIKFYVE, PSAT1, RRN3, SOS2, SPON2, THBS3, UBR4, XAF1, YES1, and ZNF606.

Genes that were present in the 32-gene list but not in the networks were not labelled. Most of the 32 identified genes have high degrees of connectivity and are likely to be biological hubs. Thus, we propose that an RT2-PCR assay of these 32 genes could be a novel, effective, and comparatively cheap way to continuously monitor astronauts’ health in space. Validation of this assay under microgravity simulation conditions is warranted for further optimization of the gene list before sending an assay kit for practical tests in space. Finally, we extracted the drug molecules (both approved and experimental, listed in Supplementary File S3: Drug_list.xls) and miRNAs (listed in Supplementary File S4: miRNA_list.xls) that potentially target these 32 genes from the drug-gene and miRNA-gene networks. These drugs and miRNAs could be applied as possible medical interventions for health conditions associated with space travel.",

Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) NASA and JAXA undertook Study GLDS-174: “Effects of a closed space environment on gene expression in hair follicles of astronauts in the International Space Station” between 2009 and 2013. Hair follicles were chosen for this study because they are the easiest attainable and noninvasive samples that are understood to be representative of most large-scale changes in the body [25]. However, Terada et al. only reported the expression of selected genes in this study and did not undertake further analysis [25]. To better understand how space travel affects astronauts’ health, we downloaded the microarray dataset (E-GEOD-74708) from the NASA GeneLab open data repository. The microarray dataset includes gene expression information for three stages: Pre-flight (6 months to 2 weeks before launch), In-flight (while staying in the ISS), and Post-flight (2 days to 3 months after returning from the ISS). We then analyzed the dataset for gene expression and gene pair correlation. Using cut-off criteria of ∣log2FC∣ ≥ 3.00 and p < 0.05, 218 DEGs were identified between In-flight and Pre-flight (Supplementary File S1: DEG_list.xls). The top 20 up- and downregulated genes are summarized in Table 1. However, no DEGs were detected between Post-flight and In-flight, suggesting that the astronauts may need a longer time than current guidelines for the body to adjust to the ground environment. Furthermore, astronauts have a much higher risk of developing various types of diseases than normal people and precautionary measures are critical to protect their health after returning to ground.

For example, the most up-regulated gene LIMCH1, encoding LIM and calponin-homology domains 1, activates the non-muscle myosin Iia complex, stabilizes focal adhesion, and inhibits cell migration [34,35]. Thus, the upregulation of LIMCH1 may explain observations that microgravity exposure can change cancer cells into less malignant phenotypes [22,23,24]. The second most up-regulated gene IER3 encodes Immediate Early Response 3 and regulates cell apoptosis [36], inflammation [37], and tumorigenesis [38]. Upregulation of IER3 has been observed in several types of cancer and may regulate cancer progression [39,40]. This implies another possible reason, other than radiation exposure, that increases the risk of astronauts developing cancer during a prolonged period of space travel. The most down-regulated gene, NFATC1, encodes Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells 1 and plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation [41], osteoclastogenesis [42], T-cell differentiation [43], lymphatic endothelial development [44], cardiac valve morphogenesis [45], and tumorigenesis [46]. The downregulation of NFATC1 may result in osteoporosis, immunocompromised conditions, and prostate cancer in astronauts during a prolonged space stay. The second most down-regulated gene, KIDINS220, encoding Kinase D Interacting Substrate 220, modulates the development and function of the nerve and cardiovascular systems [47,48]. The downregulation of KIDINS220 may contribute to the development of neurological disorders and cardiovascular diseases in astronauts. In summary, the large variation of the biological processes regulated by the DEGs provides a valuable resource of genes for us to develop a rapid assay kit (~20–30 genes) to monitor astronauts’ health conditions in space. However, it is noteworthy that the three genes reported by Terada et al., FGF18, ANGPTL7, and COMP, are not in the aforementioned DEG list because they failed to meet the cut-off criteria. 3.2. Gene Pair Correlations As mentioned above, the effect of space travel on an astronaut’s health is comprehensive and involves the regulation of many genes. It is also well-known that any biological, physiological, or pathophysiological change requires a delicate coordination of multiple genes. Therefore, we decided to carry out a gene pair correlation analysis for the whole genome (30,645 transcripts for 23,115 genes) among the Pre-flight, In-flight, and Post-flight expression profiles. As shown in Figure 1A, the genes are highly correlated in the Pre-flight, which is consistent with previous studies showing that gene expressions are correlated in normal human tissues [49]. Upon staying in the ISS for an extended period of 6 months, the genome significantly lost its regulation of the gene expression and gene coordination was scrambled (Figure 1B). Our previous studies have shown that loss of gene pair correlations is a hallmark of carcinogenesis and/or cancer progression [50,51,52]. Therefore, loss of coordination of gene expression, other than cosmic radiation and compromised immune system, is likely to be another factor that increases the risk of cancer development in astronauts. Analysis of the Post-flight dataset showed that returning to ground did not significantly improve genome regulation and coordination of gene expression (Figure 1C), implying that the effect of space travel on human health is more profound and longer lasting than currently thought. Extended care is necessary for astronauts to minimize the risk of disease development. As we progress towards crewed missions into outer space (for example, to the Moon and Mars) and other prolonged space stays, it is critical to develop rapid approaches to monitor genome regulation and establish corresponding protocols to alleviate the effects of space travel on human health. Another important question that needs to be addressed is whether the human body could establish a new “routine” for prolonged space stays and what this would look like in terms of astronauts’ health. We speculate that loss of gene expression coordination might also be responsible for other diseases/conditions astronauts experience, such as muscle loss and compromised immune system. Extensive further studies in space biomedicine and space pharmacology are warranted to prepare us for longer-term outer space exploration. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Gene pair correlations of the whole genome (30,645 transcripts for 23,115 genes) for 10 astronauts during Pre-flight (A), In-flight (B), and Post-flight (C). Positive and negative correlations are represented in blue and red, respectively. 3.3. Signaling Pathway and Disease Network of the DEGs Because DEGs are the most altered genes during a biological process, we conducted a signaling pathway analysis of the 218 DEGs between In-flight and Pre-flight to figure out which biological functions are regulated by these genes. The top 11 signaling pathways were identified to be signal transduction, immune system, gene expression, metabolism, metabolism of proteins, generic transcription pathway, developmental biology, metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, axon guidance, innate immune system, and disease (Table 2). In total, 48 genes were found to be involved in the regulation of these top 11 signaling pathways. Moreover, it is obvious that most of these DEGs are involved in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways, and that these signaling pathways regulate a broad range of biological, physiological, and/or pathophysiological processes. This analysis reconfirms that space travel imposes comprehensive effects on the human system rather than affecting an individual organ or tissue. Table 2.

As shown in Table 3, the top 20 disease/disorder conditions can broadly be divided into three categories: neoplasia/carcinoma, neurological disorder, and liver function, with the top three conditions being malignant neoplasm of the breast, colorectal carcinoma, and malignant neoplasm of the prostate. More DEGs were associated with tumor development than other diseases/disorders. In 2019, Reynolds et al. reported the effect of space radiation on astronauts’ death using a statistical analysis [53]. Of the astronauts who traveled to space between 1960 and 2018, 53 NASA astronauts have died, with 16 of those deaths (30.2%) being caused by cancer. Nevertheless, their study indicates that space radiation does not strongly impact the mortality of astronauts. This implies that weakened genome regulation (i.e., reduced gene expression correlation) is likely to be another key factor, in addition to compromised immune function, in causing tumor development in astronauts. However, these tumors may be less malignant or even benign [22,23,24]. Moreover, consistent with previous studies [54,55], our results showed that space travel significantly affects astronauts’ liver function and liver metabolism. Key genes identified from our analysis, such as GPT and UBA5, might serve as valuable monitoring biomarkers of astronauts’ liver function and even possible medical intervention points to protect astronauts’ health. Because liver is a major organ for drug metabolism, a systematic space pharmacology study is needed to establish drug profiles—including dosing, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), and even formulation—in preparation for future voyages into outer space. Space drug usage based on current information may be less effective or even detrimental to astronauts’ health. Table 3.

Design of a Rapid Assay for Space Travel Any biological or physiological process requires a delicate regulation of genes, including gene expression levels, interactions, and correlations. However, most genomics/genetic studies are focused on gene expression level rather than gene pair correlation. Although gene co-expressions and protein co-localizations are commonly studied in biomedical research, our research laboratory, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to apply gene pair correlation coefficient (a mathematical term) to describe and explain biological and medical questions [50,51,52]. Thus, to design a rapid assay to monitor astronauts’ health, we selected a set of genes with expression levels and gene pair correlations significantly altered by space travel. We calculated gene pair correlation coefficients (designated as CC) of the DEGs associated with the top 11 signaling pathways for the Pre-flight, In-flight, and Post-flight datasets, and analyzed the gene pair correlation coefficient differentials (designated as ΔCC) between the In-flight and Pre-flight and between the Post-flight and In-flight (Figure 2). The changes in gene pair CCs between the In-flight and Pre-flight datasets were obvious for every signaling pathway, except the generic transcription pathway. However, the changes between Post-flight and In-flight CCs were minimal. Thus, using ∣ΔCC∣ > 0.70 as a cut-off, we identified gene pairs with their correlation coefficients significantly altered between the In-flight and Pre-flight datasets and summarized them in Table 4. These gene pairs were then classified into four categories based on changes in correlation coefficients: Category 1—positive to more/less positive (highlighted in blue), Category 2—positive to negative (highlighted in green), Category 3—negative to positive (highlighted in brown), and Category 4—negative to more/less negative (highlighted in red). It is noteworthy that Categories 2 and 3 contained more gene pairs than Categories 1 and 4, implying that many genes lost their coordination and even started counteractive processes in space. This observation supports previous studies that found that spaceflight significantly affects gene expression and homeostasis [56]. This dramatic change in gene expression coordination is thought to affect normal biological and physiological functions in the human body and is likely detrimental to astronauts’ health. Figure 2.

To increase the sensitivity of the assay for space travel, it is rational to only include gene pairs with correlations changing from strong to weak, weak to strong, or strong to opposite strong with ∣ΔCC∣ > 0.70. Using this guideline, we identified the following gene pairs: 12 gene pairs from signal transduction, 11 gene pairs from immune system, 2 gene pairs from gene expression, 5 gene pairs from metabolism, 6 gene pairs from metabolism of proteins, 1 gene pair from developmental biology, 2 gene pairs from metabolism of lipids and lipoprotein, 1 gene pair from axon guidance, 2 gene pairs from innate immune system, and 1 gene pair from disease (Table 5).

Genes that were present in the 32-gene list but not in the networks were not labelled. Most of the 32 identified genes have high degrees of connectivity and are likely to be biological hubs. Thus, we propose that an RT2-PCR assay of these 32 genes could be a novel, effective, and comparatively cheap way to continuously monitor astronauts’ health in space. Validation of this assay under microgravity simulation conditions is warranted for further optimization of the gene list before sending an assay kit for practical tests in space. Finally, we extracted the drug molecules (both approved and experimental, listed in Supplementary File S3: Drug_list.xls) and miRNAs (listed in Supplementary File S4: miRNA_list.xls) that potentially target these 32 genes from the drug-gene and miRNA-gene networks. These drugs and miRNAs could be applied as possible medical interventions for health conditions associated with space travel.",
    "conclusion": "4. Conclusions In this study, we analyzed the effects of space travel on gene expression and correlation using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708, and systematically developed a shortlist of genes for a novel rapid assay that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health in space. However, this study faces a few limitations. First, the sample size (10 astronauts) is small due to the nature of space travel and unstandardized space biology research. More sample collection is needed to optimize the monitoring assay. Secondly, there were only two female astronauts in the microarray dataset. To get better representation and higher accuracy in the analysis, more gene expression profiles from a diverse population of astronauts should be obtained. Future studies in simulated microgravity conditions will allow for the optimization and validation of the proposed assay. It is noteworthy that this assay may address only one facet of a complete monitoring and treatment approach for astronauts’ health in space. In practice, other factors such as biomarkers and physiological metrics should also be included in the approach. Despite these drawbacks, our current study proposes a new strategy to develop genome-based rapid assays. This strategy could also be applied to other research fields such as cancer diagnostic assays.",

Copyright notice ID: 9964234 PMID: 36836933 Abstract Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have fascinated humankind since the earliest days of human history. It was only in the last century that humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts’ health in space. In this study, gene expression and correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health during space travel. Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay. Keywords: space biology, diagnostic assay, health, transcriptome, space flight1. Introduction “Space: the final frontier.” [1]. Every fan of the American science fiction TV series Star Trek is likely to remember this cardinal line of the opening monologue. Indeed, space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have continually fascinated humankind; however, it was only in the last century that humankind finally took a solid step forward by sending astronauts into space and landing on the moon [2,3]. In the 21st century, humankind has made another great leap forward in space exploration: expediting the International Space Station (ISS) program [4], sending unmanned rovers to seek signs of life on Mars [5,6], and starting private space ventures [7,8]. In addition, NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is planning to send astronauts back to the moon in 2024 and to Mars in the 2030s [9]. Through all these endeavors, we have seen the twilight of crewed space missions going beyond our harbor (Earth) and into deep space. Space travel is challenging, dangerous, and full of uncertainty. Astronauts are under sustained microgravity and cosmic radiation. Prolonged exposure to microgravity and cosmic radiation has been shown to cause a series of health problems, including loss of muscle mass [10,11], reduced bone density [12,13], compromised immune responses [14,15], impaired renal functions [16], neurological system irresponsiveness [17,18], and development of cardiovascular diseases [19,20]. Furthermore, microgravity and cosmic radiation can cause several types of cancer, such as leukemia, likely due to compromised immunity [21]. However, studies under simulated microgravity also show that microgravity affects cell proliferation and apoptosis and can change cancer cells into less malignant phenotypes [22,23,24]. These studies indicate that the impact of microgravity and cosmic radiation on human health is profound, and it is unlikely that this impact is due to changes in one gene or a small group of genes. Therefore, genomic, transcriptomic, and/or proteomic studies are crucial to fully understand the effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation on human health. These studies can lead to the development of effective strategies to monitor, prevent, and/or alleviate the effects on human health caused by space travel. Approximately 12 years ago, NASA and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) undertook a microarray study on 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) who had a six-month mission at the ISS [25]. Terada et al. used qPCR to confirm that space flight changed gene expression in astronauts [25]. Several genes, including FGF18, ANGPTL7, and COMP, were upregulated and might play a role in inhibiting cell proliferation in hair follicles. However, they neither discussed the potential effects of the differentially expressed genes on the astronauts’ health nor provided any strategy to monitor these effects. Thus, in the current study, we reanalyzed this microarray dataset, conceptualized a method that could monitor the effects of space travel on astronauts’ health, and searched for potential intervention options.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Acquisition Microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708, which is the largest publicly available space gene expression dataset, was downloaded from the NASA GeneLab Database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab, accessed on 15 March 2021). It contains gene expression profiles for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) that stayed in the ISS between July 2009 and February 2013. For each astronaut, 2 profiles were collected at each of the three time points, Pre-flight (prior to departing for the ISS), In-flight (while staying at the ISS), and Post-flight (after return to the ground).2.2. Data Processing Individual gene expression profiles were combined into three DataFrames: Pre-flight, In-flight, and Post-flight using the Pandas package (version 1.3.0) in Python [26]. These DataFrames were analyzed for possible outliers and verified for accuracy. Gene expression readings with null values were removed. Then, Agilent IDs in the data were mapped to gene names using the Ensembl BioMart database (https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview, accessed on 15 March 2021).2.3. DEG Identification and Signaling Pathway Analysis Differentially expressed genes (DEGs: ∣log2FC∣ ≥ 3.00 and p < 0.05) were identified between the In-flight and the Pre-flight DataFrames using the DEGseq package (version 1.42.0) in R [27]. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) function was applied in the calculation. No DEGs were identified between the Post-flight and the In-flight DataFrames. The DEGs between In-flight and Pre-flight were then subjected to signaling pathway analysis using the InnateDB tool [28].2.4. Calculation of Gene Pair Correlation Matrices Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient matrices for the 3 gene expression DataFrames were calculated using formula r=Σ (xi−x_) (yi−y_)Σ (xi−x_)2 Σ(yi−y_)2. The correlation matrices were subsequently transferred to be visualized using an R platform. To analyze gene pair correlations for the signaling pathways, the expression profiles of the genes for the pathways were extracted from the DataFrames to produce the DataFrame subsets. For each signaling pathway, pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated and visualized as outlined above between the In-flight and Pre-flight subsets and between the Post-flight and In-flight subsets. Positive and negative correlations were represented in blue and red, respectively. Additionally, gene pair correlation coefficient differentials, ΔCC (In-Pre) = CCIn-flight – CCPre-flight and ΔCC (Post-In) = CCPost-flight – CCIn-flight were calculated by matrix subtraction between the In-flight and Pre-flight subsets and between the Post-flight and In-flight subsets. These were subsequently visualized with correlation difference plots with positive and negative ΔCCs shown in green and red, respectively.2.5. Protein–Protein Interaction Network and Disease Network Constructions The BioGrid database [29] and DisGeNET database [30] were downloaded in March 2021 to create a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and extract the disease interaction information, respectively, for the DEGs. The networks were then constructed using Python and visualized using Cytoscape [31].2.6. Drug and miRNA Screenings The Drugbank [32] and miRTARBase [33] databases were also downloaded in March 2021 to extract the drug and miRNA interaction information for the DEGs. The networks were subsequently constructed using Python and visualized using Cytoscape. From these two networks, we identified potential drugs and miRNAs targeting the 32 genes that were identified to be used in a rapid RT2-PCR assay for space travel.3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) NASA and JAXA undertook Study GLDS-174: “Effects of a closed space environment on gene expression in hair follicles of astronauts in the International Space Station” between 2009 and 2013. Hair follicles were chosen for this study because they are the easiest attainable and noninvasive samples that are understood to be representative of most large-scale changes in the body [25]. However, Terada et al. only reported the expression of selected genes in this study and did not undertake further analysis [25]. To better understand how space travel affects astronauts’ health, we downloaded the microarray dataset (E-GEOD-74708) from the NASA GeneLab open data repository. The microarray dataset includes gene expression information for three stages: Pre-flight (6 months to 2 weeks before launch), In-flight (while staying in the ISS), and Post-flight (2 days to 3 months after returning from the ISS). We then analyzed the dataset for gene expression and gene pair correlation. Using cut-off criteria of ∣log2FC∣ ≥ 3.00 and p < 0.05, 218 DEGs were identified between In-flight and Pre-flight (Supplementary File S1: DEG_list.xls). The top 20 up- and downregulated genes are summarized in Table 1. However, no DEGs were detected between Post-flight and In-flight, suggesting that the astronauts may need a longer time than current guidelines for the body to adjust to the ground environment. Furthermore, astronauts have a much higher risk of developing various types of diseases than normal people and precautionary measures are critical to protect their health after returning to ground.

For example, the most up-regulated gene LIMCH1, encoding LIM and calponin-homology domains 1, activates the non-muscle myosin Iia complex, stabilizes focal adhesion, and inhibits cell migration [34,35]. Thus, the upregulation of LIMCH1 may explain observations that microgravity exposure can change cancer cells into less malignant phenotypes [22,23,24]. The second most up-regulated gene IER3 encodes Immediate Early Response 3 and regulates cell apoptosis [36], inflammation [37], and tumorigenesis [38]. Upregulation of IER3 has been observed in several types of cancer and may regulate cancer progression [39,40]. This implies another possible reason, other than radiation exposure, that increases the risk of astronauts developing cancer during a prolonged period of space travel. The most down-regulated gene, NFATC1, encodes Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells 1 and plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation [41], osteoclastogenesis [42], T-cell differentiation [43], lymphatic endothelial development [44], cardiac valve morphogenesis [45], and tumorigenesis [46]. The downregulation of NFATC1 may result in osteoporosis, immunocompromised conditions, and prostate cancer in astronauts during a prolonged space stay. The second most down-regulated gene, KIDINS220, encoding Kinase D Interacting Substrate 220, modulates the development and function of the nerve and cardiovascular systems [47,48]. The downregulation of KIDINS220 may contribute to the development of neurological disorders and cardiovascular diseases in astronauts. In summary, the large variation of the biological processes regulated by the DEGs provides a valuable resource of genes for us to develop a rapid assay kit (~20–30 genes) to monitor astronauts’ health conditions in space. However, it is noteworthy that the three genes reported by Terada et al., FGF18, ANGPTL7, and COMP, are not in the aforementioned DEG list because they failed to meet the cut-off criteria.3.2. Gene Pair Correlations As mentioned above, the effect of space travel on an astronaut’s health is comprehensive and involves the regulation of many genes. It is also well-known that any biological, physiological, or pathophysiological change requires a delicate coordination of multiple genes. Therefore, we decided to carry out a gene pair correlation analysis for the whole genome (30,645 transcripts for 23,115 genes) among the Pre-flight, In-flight, and Post-flight expression profiles. As shown in Figure 1A, the genes are highly correlated in the Pre-flight, which is consistent with previous studies showing that gene expressions are correlated in normal human tissues [49]. Upon staying in the ISS for an extended period of 6 months, the genome significantly lost its regulation of the gene expression and gene coordination was scrambled (Figure 1B). Our previous studies have shown that loss of gene pair correlations is a hallmark of carcinogenesis and/or cancer progression [50,51,52]. Therefore, loss of coordination of gene expression, other than cosmic radiation and compromised immune system, is likely to be another factor that increases the risk of cancer development in astronauts. Analysis of the Post-flight dataset showed that returning to ground did not significantly improve genome regulation and coordination of gene expression (Figure 1C), implying that the effect of space travel on human health is more profound and longer lasting than currently thought. Extended care is necessary for astronauts to minimize the risk of disease development. As we progress towards crewed missions into outer space (for example, to the Moon and Mars) and other prolonged space stays, it is critical to develop rapid approaches to monitor genome regulation and establish corresponding protocols to alleviate the effects of space travel on human health. Another important question that needs to be addressed is whether the human body could establish a new “routine” for prolonged space stays and what this would look like in terms of astronauts’ health. We speculate that loss of gene expression coordination might also be responsible for other diseases/conditions astronauts experience, such as muscle loss and compromised immune system. Extensive further studies in space biomedicine and space pharmacology are warranted to prepare us for longer-term outer space exploration. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Gene pair correlations of the whole genome (30,645 transcripts for 23,115 genes) for 10 astronauts during Pre-flight (A), In-flight (B), and Post-flight (C). Positive and negative correlations are represented in blue and red, respectively.3.3. Signaling Pathway and Disease Network of the DEGs Because DEGs are the most altered genes during a biological process, we conducted a signaling pathway analysis of the 218 DEGs between In-flight and Pre-flight to figure out which biological functions are regulated by these genes. The top 11 signaling pathways were identified to be signal transduction, immune system, gene expression, metabolism, metabolism of proteins, generic transcription pathway, developmental biology, metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, axon guidance, innate immune system, and disease (Table 2). In total, 48 genes were found to be involved in the regulation of these top 11 signaling pathways. Moreover, it is obvious that most of these DEGs are involved in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways, and that these signaling pathways regulate a broad range of biological, physiological, and/or pathophysiological processes. This analysis reconfirms that space travel imposes comprehensive effects on the human system rather than affecting an individual organ or tissue. Table 2.

As shown in Table 3, the top 20 disease/disorder conditions can broadly be divided into three categories: neoplasia/carcinoma, neurological disorder, and liver function, with the top three conditions being malignant neoplasm of the breast, colorectal carcinoma, and malignant neoplasm of the prostate. More DEGs were associated with tumor development than other diseases/disorders. In 2019, Reynolds et al. reported the effect of space radiation on astronauts’ death using a statistical analysis [53]. Of the astronauts who traveled to space between 1960 and 2018, 53 NASA astronauts have died, with 16 of those deaths (30.2%) being caused by cancer. Nevertheless, their study indicates that space radiation does not strongly impact the mortality of astronauts. This implies that weakened genome regulation (i.e., reduced gene expression correlation) is likely to be another key factor, in addition to compromised immune function, in causing tumor development in astronauts. However, these tumors may be less malignant or even benign [22,23,24]. Moreover, consistent with previous studies [54,55], our results showed that space travel significantly affects astronauts’ liver function and liver metabolism. Key genes identified from our analysis, such as GPT and UBA5, might serve as valuable monitoring biomarkers of astronauts’ liver function and even possible medical intervention points to protect astronauts’ health. Because liver is a major organ for drug metabolism, a systematic space pharmacology study is needed to establish drug profiles—including dosing, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), and even formulation—in preparation for future voyages into outer space. Space drug usage based on current information may be less effective or even detrimental to astronauts’ health. Table 3.

Design of a Rapid Assay for Space Travel Any biological or physiological process requires a delicate regulation of genes, including gene expression levels, interactions, and correlations. However, most genomics/genetic studies are focused on gene expression level rather than gene pair correlation. Although gene co-expressions and protein co-localizations are commonly studied in biomedical research, our research laboratory, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to apply gene pair correlation coefficient (a mathematical term) to describe and explain biological and medical questions [50,51,52]. Thus, to design a rapid assay to monitor astronauts’ health, we selected a set of genes with expression levels and gene pair correlations significantly altered by space travel. We calculated gene pair correlation coefficients (designated as CC) of the DEGs associated with the top 11 signaling pathways for the Pre-flight, In-flight, and Post-flight datasets, and analyzed the gene pair correlation coefficient differentials (designated as ΔCC) between the In-flight and Pre-flight and between the Post-flight and In-flight (Figure 2). The changes in gene pair CCs between the In-flight and Pre-flight datasets were obvious for every signaling pathway, except the generic transcription pathway. However, the changes between Post-flight and In-flight CCs were minimal. Thus, using ∣ΔCC∣ > 0.70 as a cut-off, we identified gene pairs with their correlation coefficients significantly altered between the In-flight and Pre-flight datasets and summarized them in Table 4. These gene pairs were then classified into four categories based on changes in correlation coefficients: Category 1—positive to more/less positive (highlighted in blue), Category 2—positive to negative (highlighted in green), Category 3—negative to positive (highlighted in brown), and Category 4—negative to more/less negative (highlighted in red). It is noteworthy that Categories 2 and 3 contained more gene pairs than Categories 1 and 4, implying that many genes lost their coordination and even started counteractive processes in space. This observation supports previous studies that found that spaceflight significantly affects gene expression and homeostasis [56]. This dramatic change in gene expression coordination is thought to affect normal biological and physiological functions in the human body and is likely detrimental to astronauts’ health. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Gene pair correlations ((1): Pre-flight, (2): In-flight, and (3): Post-flight) and differentials of gene pair correlations (4): between In-flight and Pre-flight and (5): between Post-flight and In-flight for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the top 11 signaling pathways. The top 11 signaling pathways are signal transduction, immune system, gene expression, metabolism, metabolism of proteins, generic transcription pathway, developmental biology, metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, axon guidance, innate immune system, and disease. The top 11 signaling pathways were identified from InnateDB analysis of the 218 DEGs (∣log2FC∣ ≥ 3.00 and p < 0.05). Positive and negative gene pair correlations are represented in blue and red, respectively; and positive and negative differentials of gene pair correlations are represented in green and red, respectively.Table 4.

Gene pairs with correlation coefficients changed from positive to less/more positive (Category 1), positive to negative (Category 2), negative to positive (Category 3), and negative to less/more negative (Category 4) were highlighted in blue, green, brown, and red, respectively.

To increase the sensitivity of the assay for space travel, it is rational to only include gene pairs with correlations changing from strong to weak, weak to strong, or strong to opposite strong with ∣ΔCC∣ > 0.70. Using this guideline, we identified the following gene pairs: 12 gene pairs from signal transduction, 11 gene pairs from immune system, 2 gene pairs from gene expression, 5 gene pairs from metabolism, 6 gene pairs from metabolism of proteins, 1 gene pair from developmental biology, 2 gene pairs from metabolism of lipids and lipoprotein, 1 gene pair from axon guidance, 2 gene pairs from innate immune system, and 1 gene pair from disease (Table 5). In total, 32 genes were selected, and they are AARS2, ACSL4, ATF2, BIRC2, CCL2, CCNC, CHMP4C, COL4A4, CREB1, CRHR1, CTNNBIP1, DPP4, EIF4E2, GNE, GPT, IL7, KIDINS220, MAGT1, NDUFA1, NFATC1, PCSK1, PDPK1, PIKFYVE, PSAT1, RRN3, SOS2, SPON2, THBS3, UBR4, XAF1, YES1, and ZNF606.

Genes that were present in the 32-gene list but not in the networks were not labelled. Most of the 32 identified genes have high degrees of connectivity and are likely to be biological hubs. Thus, we propose that an RT2-PCR assay of these 32 genes could be a novel, effective, and comparatively cheap way to continuously monitor astronauts’ health in space. Validation of this assay under microgravity simulation conditions is warranted for further optimization of the gene list before sending an assay kit for practical tests in space. Finally, we extracted the drug molecules (both approved and experimental, listed in Supplementary File S3: Drug_list.xls) and miRNAs (listed in Supplementary File S4: miRNA_list.xls) that potentially target these 32 genes from the drug-gene and miRNA-gene networks. These drugs and miRNAs could be applied as possible medical interventions for health conditions associated with space travel.4. Conclusions In this study, we analyzed the effects of space travel on gene expression and correlation using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708, and systematically developed a shortlist of genes for a novel rapid assay that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health in space. However, this study faces a few limitations. First, the sample size (10 astronauts) is small due to the nature of space travel and unstandardized space biology research. More sample collection is needed to optimize the monitoring assay. Secondly, there were only two female astronauts in the microarray dataset. To get better representation and higher accuracy in the analysis, more gene expression profiles from a diverse population of astronauts should be obtained. Future studies in simulated microgravity conditions will allow for the optimization and validation of the proposed assay. It is noteworthy that this assay may address only one facet of a complete monitoring and treatment approach for astronauts’ health in space. In practice, other factors such as biomarkers and physiological metrics should also be included in the approach. Despite these drawbacks, our current study proposes a new strategy to develop genome-based rapid assays. This strategy could also be applied to other research fields such as cancer diagnostic assays.Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/life13020576/s1, File S1: DEG_list.xls; File S2: Disease_DEG.xls; File S3: Drug_list.xls; File S4: miRNA_list.xls; Supplementary Figure S1: Protein-protein interaction (A), disease-gene (B), drug-gene (C) and miRNA-gene (D) networks for the 218 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Pre-flight and In-flight gene expression datasets collected from 10 astronauts (8 males and 2 females).

Copyright notice ID: 10793275 PMID: 38038463 ABSTRACT Sphingomonadaceae are common membrane colonizers and biofilm formers. As part of our studies on long-term genetic changes in drinking water biofilm species, we report the draft genome sequence of Sphingomonas strain Sph5, isolated from a tap water filtration membrane. The isolate was determined as Sphingomonas paucimobilis through whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly. KEYWORDS: draft genome, WGS, water, SphingomonasANNOUNCEMENT Widely used for drinking water, membrane filtration systems face biofouling due to microbe accumulation and biofilm formation. Studies reveal Sphingomonadaceae as common initial colonizers, persisting dominantly during biofilm growth (1 – 4). Here, we report the genome sequence of a prevalent isolate. Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 was isolated from a biofilm on a Nadir MP005 microfiltration membrane used for drinking water biofouling studies (1, 5). Sph5 was previously reported to be phylogenetically closest to Sphingomonas sanguinis strains BAB-7166 (99%) and NBRC 13937 (99%) based on 16S rRNA sequencing and cultivation methods (1). However, the whole genome sequence (WGS) was not reported. WGS analysis is critical to uncover strain-specific traits associated with membrane biofouling. Here, we report the WGS of Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 using Illumina short-read sequencing and de novo assembly methods. We received the Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 water isolate from Wetsus, Netherlands. Single isolated colonies were obtained on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A, Teknova R0005; Difco 214530) and cultured in R2A broth at room temperature. Genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy UltraClean microbial kit (Qiagen 12224) following the company-provided protocol. Sequencing libraries were generated using Kapa’s Hyperplus kit (KK8514) and IDT adapters (#00989130v2). Quality was verified using an Agilent Tapestation and qPCR (NEBNext Library Quant Kit, E7630L) on Thermo Fisher’s Quantstudio5. Nineteen million 2 × 150 bp reads were obtained on a NovaSeq (Illumina) at Anschutz Medical Campus Genomics and Microarray Core, with an average Phred score of 33–36 calculated by FastQC [v0.11.9 (6)]. Assembly was performed with SPADES, default isolate settings [v3.15.2 (7)]. Contigs were aligned to  databases with DIAMOND [v2.0.13 (8)]. Completeness was estimated using BUSCO [v5.2.2 (9)] proteobacteria marker genes. Of the 219 genes, there were 214 (97.7%) complete and single copy, 2 (0.9%) duplicated, 1 (0.5%) fragmented, and 2 (0.9%) missing. For species identification, average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated between all complete Sphingomonas genomes and Sph5 with PYANI [v0.2.11 (10)] and MUMMER [v4.0.0 (11)]. ANI scores between Sph5 and S. paucimobilis ranged from 99.77%–99.95%, while ANI between Sph5 and S. sanguinis was 87.74%. Annotations were predicted with Prokka [v1.14.6 (12)], given S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis references (Table 1), and used for orthogroup-based phylogeny construction with Orthofinder [v2.5.4 (13)], MAFFT [v7.490 (14)], and FastTree [v.2.1.10 (15)].

As a result, S. paucimobilis reference genomes were used for RagTag [v2.1.0 (16)] scaffolding of Sph5 contigs. ASM1602843v1 was the best scaffold (93.6% total length in three longest contigs of resulting assembly). Realignment of raw reads to ASM1602843v1-scaffolded Sph5 assembly with BWA [v0.7.17 (17)], SamTools [v1.12 (18)], and Picard [v2.25.0 (19)], evaluated by Mosdepth [v0.3.3 (20)], supports this (99.48% reads aligned, 1,089× coverage). Fig 1. Open in a new tab Orthofinder-generated rooted tree of 50 complete Sphingomonas genomes with the Sph5 strain. Branch lengths represent evolutionary distance. We used the multiple-sequence alignment option with MAFFT and used FastTree to infer the trees. The mathematical parameters used are built in to the OrthoFinder tool, and we did not alter them from the default.Re-annotation with Prokka predicts 4,321 CDS, 3 rRNAs, 54 tRNAs, 1 tmRNA, and 1 repeat region. Of the CDS, 3,342 could be functionally annotated.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was funded by NASA Space Biology, grant number 80NSSC19K1597, and NASA BAC, grant number HS5HWWK1AAU5.Contributor Information Jiseon Yang, Email: jyang41@asu.edu.

    "title": "Overexpression of CupB5 activates alginate overproduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by a novel AlgW-dependent mechanism",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4116675/",
    "abstract": "Summary In P. aeruginosa, alginate overproduction, also known as mucoidy, is negatively regulated by the transmembrane protein MucA, which sequesters the alternative sigma factor AlgU. MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the chaperone-usher pathway gene cupB5. CupB5-dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in vitro. Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals. Keywords: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, alginate, MucA, MucB, CupB5, signal transduction",
    "introduction": "Introduction Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic human pathogen, capable of thriving in different environmental niches. Activation of the AlgU-regulated extracytoplasmic stress response results in the production of copious amounts of an exopolysaccharide called alginate, forming a capsule that protects the bacterium from the host-immune system. Alginate production by P. aeruginosa is a particular problem for patients with cystic fibrosis, whose dehydrated mucus-filled lungs provide an environment especially suited for bacterial infection (Folkesson et al., 2012). Nonmucoid strains initially colonize the lungs, and alginate overproduction caused by mutations in mucA results in a mucoid phenotype and a chronic lung infection (Ciofu et al., 2005; Hogardt et al., 2007; Mena et al., 2008). Among many roles in pathogenesis, alginate can promote adherence to lung epithelial cells, reduce the efficiency of phagocytosis, and protect bacteria from antibiotics (Govan and Deretic, 1996; Pier et al., 2001; Leid et al., 2005). The extracytoplasmic stress-response pathways in P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and other Gram-negative bacteria involve regulated intramembrane proteolysis and share common features. For example, outer-membrane and periplasmic stress initiates a proteolytic cascade that ultimately degrades a transmembrane anti-sigma factor and releases the sigma factor to up-regulate stress-response genes (Alba et al., 2002; Kanehara et al., 2002; Walsh et al., 2003; Akiyama et al., 2004; Flynn et al., 2004; Chaba et al., 2007). In P. aeruginosa, proteolysis of wild type MucA, the anti-sigma factor, releases the AlgU sigma factor, which enhances transcription of the genes responsible for alginate biosynthesis from the algD promoter (Martin et al., 1993; Wood et al., 2006). In P. aeruginosa, degradation of MucA is normally initiated by cleavage by the AlgW protease at site 1 near the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, continues with cleavage by the MucP protease at site 2 near the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, and is completed in the cytoplasm by AAA+ proteases such as ClpXP (Akiyama et al., 2004; Alba et al., 2002; Chaba et al., 2007; Flynn et al., 2004; Kanehara et al., 2002; Qiu et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2008b; Walsh et al., 2003). Two signals are required to initiate this proteolytic cascade. The C-terminal peptides of proteins that accumulate in the periplasm during stress, including outer-membrane proteins (OMPs), bind to the PDZ domains of the trimeric AlgW protease and allosterically activate site-1 cleavage of MucA, but MucB competes for MucA binding and can inhibit this cleavage (Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009). Recent studies show that lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a key component of the outer membrane, can bind MucB and cause release of MucA (Lima et al., 2013). Here, we identify CupB5 as a novel activator of the alginate-production pathway. CupB5, an adhesive protein, is a member of one of the chaperone/usher pathways (CupA-E) that mediate assembly of pili and play roles in bacterial pathogenesis, adhesion, and biofilm formation (Hull et al., 1981; Marklund et al., 1992; Soto and Hultgren, 1999; Vallet et al., 2001; Giraud et al., 2011; Mikkelsen et al., 2009). These secretion systems, which are best characterized in Gram-negative bacteria (Sauer et al., 2000; Waksman and Hultgren, 2009), contain a periplasmic chaperone that maintains proteins to be secreted in an unassembled state and an usher that transports these proteins through the outer membrane. We find that overexpression of CupB5 in the absence of its chaperone induces a mucoid phenotype in P. aeruginosa and provide evidence that a peptide signal in CupB5 enhances OMP-activated cleavage of MucA by AlgW, even in the presence of MucB, allowing initiation of AlgU signaling.",

    "results": "Results Overexpression of CupB5 induces mucoidy To identify new alginate regulatory genes, we performed mariner-transposon mutagenesis (Wong and Mekalanos, 2000) in the nonmucoid P. aeruginosa reference strain PAO1. We isolated a mucoid variant (PAO1-VE22) and identified the site of a single-copy insertion by inverse PCR and Southern-blot analysis (data not shown). The transposon insertion was six base pairs before the TAG stop codon at the 3′ end of cupB4 (Fig. 1A) and introduced a σ70-dependent PGm promoter that drove expression of the gentamicin resistance cassette and downstream genes (Rubin et al., 1999). Alginate production by PAO1-VE22 (31 ± 1.5 μg/ml/OD600) was substantially higher than that of PAO1 (8.5 ± 0.02 μg/ml/OD600) after 24 h growth at 37°C. To test if altered expression of cupB4, cupB5, or cupB6 was responsible for the mucoidy of PAO1-VE22, we cloned each individual coding sequence with an N-terminal HA epitope and C-terminal H6 tag in pHERD20T under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter (Qiu et al., 2008a). Plasmids expressing the tagged variant of CupB5, but not of CupB4 or CupB6, induced mucoid conversion and high-level alginate production in PAO1 (Fig. 1B). Western-blot analysis indicated that the plasmid-expressed CupB4, CupB5, and CupB6 variants were detectable when overexpressed in PAO1, albeit with fragmentation of CupB5 (Fig. 1C). We conclude that enhanced expression of CupB5 or a CupB5 fragment induces mucoidy and increased alginate in PAO1-VE22. Fig. 1. Overproduction of CupB5 causes mucoid conversion in PAO1. Open in a new tab (A) Organization of the cupB1-cupB6 gene cluster (www.pseudomonas.com), and location of the transposon insertion site in PAO1-VE22. (B) Alginate production, measured using the carbazole assay, and colony phenotypes (M, mucoid; NM, nonmucoid) were assayed following transformation of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 with plasmid HERD20T or variants expressing HA-CupB4-H6, HA-CupB5-H6, or HA-CupB6-H6, and overnight growth of colonies on PIA plates (carbenecillin 300 μg ml−1, 0.1% L-arabinose) at 37°C. Values are averages ± SEM (n=3). (C) Cell lysates of PAO1 carrying appropriate plasmids were electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide gels, and Western-blots using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody were used to detect HA-CupB4-H6, HA-CupB5-H6, or HA-CupB6-H6. The rightmost lane shows that HA cross-reactive proteins were absent in PAO1 transformed with the pHERD20T empty-vector. Genetic requirements for CupB5-induced mucoidy Deletion of five single genes required for the AlgU response (algW, mucP, clpX, clpP, or algU) in PAO1 prevented mucoidy and high-level alginate production when HA-CupB5-H6 was overproduced from a plasmid in these strains (Fig. 2A). In-frame deletion of algW in PAO1-VE22 also prevented alginate overproduction and mucoidy, a phenotype that was complemented by plasmid expression of AlgW but not AlgW lacking its PDZ domain (Fig. 2B). Consistently, when AlgU-dependent promoters were fused to lacZ and introduced into PAO1-VE22 or PAO1-VE2, a strain in which AlgW is activated by overproduction of MucE (Qiu et al., 2007), β-galactosidase levels were increased markedly compared to the same promoter fusions in PAO1 (Fig. S1). CupB5 is normally an extracellular protein (Ruer et al., 2008; Vallet et al., 2001). However, its overexpression in the absence of corresponding levels of the CupB4 chaperone and usher could result in periplasmic accumulation that acts directly or indirectly through AlgW to activate alginate production. Fig. 2. Genetic requirements for CupB5-mediated alginate overproduction. Open in a new tab (A) Wild-type (WT) or mutant PAO1 strains were transformed with pHERD20 encoding HA-CupB5-H6, grown on PIA plates with 0.1% L-arabinose for 24 h at 37°C to induce HA-CupB5-H6 overexpression, and mucoid phenotypes and alginate production were determined. The algD gene encodes an enzyme required for alginate production. The algU, algW, mucP, clpX, and clpP genes are required for induction of algU-dependent alginate production. (B) Alginate production and mucoid phenotypes of different strains were measured after growth for 24 h at 37°C on PIA plates plus 300 μg m−1 carbenecillin and 0.1% L-Ara. In both panels, values are averages ± SEM (n=3). CupB5 contains an internal signal for alginate overproduction Because C-terminal sequences terminating with an aromatic residue and α-carboxylate can activate AlgW, we initially tested if the C-terminal residues of CupB5 (Asn1016-Ile1017-Trp1018) were responsible for activating AlgW and inducing mucoidy. However, overexpression of CupB5 variants with a C-terminal H6 tag or containing a deletion of the Asn1016-Ile1017-Trp1018 sequence and a C-terminal H6 tag still induced mucoidy in PAO1 (Table S1). Thus, the extreme C-terminal residues of CupB5 play little or no role in mediating alginate overproduction. Moreover, overproduction of variants containing just the N-terminal 491 residues of CupB5 also induced mucoidy (Table S1), indicating that a major inducing signal is located in this portion of the protein. Deletion analyses revealed that the Thr489-Val490-Val491 sequence of CupB5 appeared important for alginate overproduction. Specifically, overexpression of CupB51–491 produced substantially more alginate than overexpression of CupB51–489 or CupB51–488 (Fig. 3A), and Western blotting showed that these proteins were present at a similar intracellular levels (Fig. 3B). Cells expressing CupB51–490 also produced less alginate (Fig. 3A), but this protein appeared to be severely truncated by degradation (Fig. 3B). Based on these results, we hypothesized that the CupB5 activating signal included some or all of the Thr489-Val490-Val491 sequence. Fig. 3. Delineation of the CupB5 signal that activates alginate production. Open in a new tab (A) CupB5 variants with C-terminal truncations were cloned into pHERD20T, expressed in strain PAO1, and alginate production following growth in the presence of 1% L-arabinose was assayed. Proteins containing CupB5 residues 1–585 and 1–491 contain the complete GYYYTVV491 sequence motif. The remaining proteins contain only a portion of this motif. (B) Western-blot detection using anti-HA monoclonal antibody of truncated CupB5 variants. CupB5 peptides stimulate OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA and partially relieve MucB inhibition in vitro We initially tested if synthetic peptides including the Thr489-Val490-Val491 CupB5 sequence might stimulate alginate production in a manner analogous to OMPs by activating AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA. One peptide (GYYYTVV) corresponded to the seven C-terminal residues of CupB51–491, another (YVGYVTY) was a sequence-scrambled variant, and a third (GYYYT) corresponded to the C-terminus of CupB51–489, which did not stimulate alginate production in vivo. We assayed the kinetics of AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA in vitro by the production of acid-soluble peptide fragments in the presence of different concentrations of the CupB5 peptides. Each CupB5 peptide stimulated AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA to a small degree, but at far lower rates than a peptide (WVF) corresponding to the C-terminal residues of MucE, a potent activator of AlgW (Fig. 4A & 4B). Thus, the CupB5 peptides do not substitute for OMP-like peptides in robust activation of AlgW cleavage of MucA. Fig. 4. CupB5 peptides relieve MucB inhibition of MucA cleavage by AlgW. Open in a new tab (A) Cleavage of 35S-labelled MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) was assayed by the time-dependent release of acid-soluble peptides in the presence of either the OMP-like WVF peptide (400 μM), the wild-type GYYYT or GYYYTVV CupB5 peptides (400 μM), the sequence-scrambled YVGYVTY peptide (400 μM), or a buffer control. (B) Second-order rate constants for MucA cleavage were determined by incubating 35S-labelled MucA (20 μM) and AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) with different concentrations of WVF or CupB5 peptides and measuring the time-dependent increase in acid-soluble products. Rates were divided by the MucA and AlgW concentrations to determine activity. Lines are fits to the equation activity = basal + stimulated/(1+(Kact/[peptide])h). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2). (C) Second-order rate constants for cleavage of 35S-MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) were determined as described in panel B in the presence of different combinations of WVF peptide (110 μM), MucB (25 μM dimer), and wild-type or scrambled CupB5 peptides (405 μM). Values are averages of two or more independent trials ± SEM. (D) Second-order rate constants for cleavage of 35S-MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) and WVF peptide (150 μM) were determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of the GYYYT, GYYYTVV, or sequence-scrambled YVGYVTY peptides. Lines are fits to the Hill equation: rate = basal + Vmax/(1 + (Ks/[peptide])h). For GYYYT, Ks was 55 ± 13 μM and h was 2.1 ± 0.9. For GYYYTVV, Ks was 143 ± 31 μM and h was 3.5 ± 2.2.As expected from previous studies (Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009), addition of MucB suppressed cleavage of 35S-MucA by WVF-activated AlgW (Fig. 4C). Moreover, addition of just the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT CupB5 peptides did not result in AlgW cleavage of MucA when MucB was present (Fig. 4C). Next, we tested if the wild-type or scrambled CupB5 peptides could relieve MucB inhibition of AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA in the presence of the WVF activating peptide. Importantly, titration of GYYYTVV or GYYYT into reactions containing MucA, MucB, AlgW, and WVF peptide resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the rate of MucA cleavage (Fig. 4D). Almost no increase in MucA cleavage was observed with the scrambled YVGYVTY peptide (Fig. 4D), demonstrating sequence specificity. Interestingly, activation of MucA cleavage by GYYYT occurred at lower peptide concentrations and was less cooperative as judged by the Hill constant than activation by the GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. 4D). Thus, the C-terminal valine residues of GYYYTVV are not necessary for activation of MucA cleavage in the presence of MucB in vitro. Although the GYYYTVV and GYYYT peptides activated AlgW cleavage of MucA to similar levels in the presence of WVF peptide and MucB, these levels were approximately one-third of the MucA cleavage rate observed with WVF and AlgW alone (compare Figs. 4B and 4D). We conclude that the CupB5 peptides can partially relieve MucB inhibition of WVF-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA. Lipopolysaccharides bind MucB and competitively displace MucA (Lima et al., 2013). Because MucB normally binds peptide sequences in MucA, it seemed plausible that CupB5 peptides might also compete for MucA binding to MucB. We tested this possibility by assaying the ability of the CupB5 peptides to elute 35S-MucB from MucA that had been covalently bound to agarose resin (Fig. 5A). In this assay, the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment and free MucA efficiently competed with resin-bound MucA for MucB binding. However, incubation of 35S-MucB•MucA resin with the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT peptides resulted in no more 35S-MucB release than observed in the buffer control (Fig. 5A). This result strongly suggests that the CupB5 peptides do not relieve MucB inhibition by directly competing for its binding to MucA. Binding of the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment converts MucB dimers to tetramers (Lima et al., 2013). By contrast, incubation of MucB with GYYYTVV peptide resulted in no substantial change in elution during gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. S2). Fig. 5. CupB5 peptides do not compete with MucB for MucA binding but stimulate WVF-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA. Open in a new tab (A) Release of 35S-MucB from MucA-agarose following incubation with buffer, MucA (155 μM), L-IIA (20 mg/mL), or CupB5 peptides (~300 μM). For the CupB5 peptides, values are averages ± SEM (n=3). For L-IIA, the value is the average ± SEM (n=2). (B) Rates of cleavage by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) and WVF peptide (150 μM) were measured at different concentrations of 35S-MucA in the presence or absence of CupB5 peptides (300 μM). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2) and were fit to the Hill form of the Michaelis-Menten equation, rate = Vmax/(1 + (KM/[substrate])h). (C) Rates of cleavage of 35S-MucA (50 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) were assayed at difference concentrations of WVF peptide in the presence or absence of CupB5 peptides (300 μM). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2) and were fit to the equation rate = basal + Vmax/(1 + (Kact/[peptide])h). Without CupB5 peptide, h was 2.2 ± 1, Kact was 11 ± 2 μM, and Vmax was 1250 ± 150 M−1 s−1. With GYYYTVV peptide, h was 1.5 ± 0.8, Kact was 18 ± 7 μM, and Vmax was 2490 ± 490 M−1 s−1.Because CupB5 peptides did not strongly activate AlgW cleavage of MucA in the absence of the WVF peptide or release MucA from MucB, we speculated that they might act in concert with the WVF peptide to allow AlgW to bind and degrade MucA more efficiently and thus to compete better with MucB for the MucA substrate. This model predicts that MucA should be degraded at a faster rate in the presence of both the WVF and CupB5 peptides. Indeed, when we assayed the rate of cleavage of different concentrations of 35S-MucA by AlgW, faster cleavage was observed when both the WVF and wild-type CupB5 peptides were present compared to only the WVF peptide or the WVF peptide and scrambled CupB5 control peptide (Fig. 5B). We also measured the rate of AlgW cleavage of a fixed concentration of MucA in the presence of increasing concentrations of WVF peptide with or without additional GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. 5C). When GYYYTVV peptide was present, the maximum rate of MucA cleavage increased almost two-fold. We conclude that the CupB5 peptides and WVF peptide act synergistically to enhance AlgW cleavage of MucA, allowing better competition with MucB. In E. coli, RseA, RseB, and DegS are homologs of MucA, MucB, and AlgW. A YYF peptide efficiently activates DegS cleavage of RseA in the absence of RseB or in the presence of both RseB and lipopolysaccharides (Walsh et al., 2003; Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2007; Lima et al., 2013). The CupB5 peptides did not substantially stimulate cleavage of 35S-RseA by YYF-activated DegS in the presence of RseB (Fig. S3), suggesting that they do not interact with DegS. This result is not surprising, as DegS and AlgW share only 44% sequence homology. Suppressing and enhancing alginate production If CupB5 allows AlgW to compete more efficiently with MucB for MucA binding and cleavage, then overproduction of MucB in strain PAO1-VE22 would be expected to decrease alginate production. Indeed, plasmid-mediated MucB overproduction had this effect, as did plasmid-mediated overproduction of MucA (Fig. 6A). The latter result suggests that with enough additional uncleaved MucA, AlgU is efficiently inhibited even when more MucA is degraded than usual. Even the CupB5-induced elevated rate of AlgW cleavage of MucA in this strain must be too slow to free enough AlgU to fully enhance transcription of alginate biosynthesis genes. Fig. 6. Inducing and suppressing alginate production in P. aeruginosa strains. Open in a new tab (A) Strains overproducing CupB5 (PAO1-VE22) or MucE (PAO1-VE2) were transformed with plasmid HERD20T or variants overexpressing MucA or MucB, grown at 37°C for 24 h on PIA plates supplemented with 0.1% L-arabinose, and alginate production and colony phenotypes (M, mucoid; NM, nonmucoid) were assayed. (B) Alginate production and mucoid phenotypes were assayed in strains PAO1, PAO1-VE2 (mucE overexpressed), PAO1 mucB::tetR (mucB inactivated), and PAO1-VE22 (cupB5 overexpressed) transformed with the HERD20T plasmid vector or variants expressing HA-CupB4-H6 or HA-CupB5-H6. Values are averages ± SEM (n=3). Statistical significance was determine using the Student’s t-test (*P<0.05; **<0.005).Plasmid-expressed MucB or MucA also decreased alginate production in PAO1-VE2, a strain expressing higher MucE levels (Fig. 6A). The rate of AlgW cleavage of MucA in PAO1-VE2 is apparently too low to fully degrade the excess MucA, resulting in greater inhibition of AlgU and reduced alginate production. Excess MucB presumably outstrips the endogenous anti-MucB signals in PAO1-VE2 and mass action results in enhanced binding to MucA, reducing the rate of MucA cleavage by activated AlgW. To determine how simultaneous overexpression of MucE and CupB5 affected alginate levels,, we transformed PAO1-VE2 with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB5-H6. Notably, alginate levels in this strain were higher than in the empty-vector control (Fig. 6B), suggesting that activation of AlgW through MucE and through CupB5 occur synergistically. Our biochemical results predict that MucB should not be genetically required for CupB5-mediated pathway activation. To test this prediction, we used a transposon-insertion strain, PAO1-mucB::tetR, which displayed an elevated level of basal alginate production and mucoid phenotype (Fig. 6B). When we transformed PAO1-mucB::tetR with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB5-H6, alginate production increased compared to the empty-vector control (Fig. 6B), indicating that CupB5 overexpression induces pathway activation by a MucB-independent mechanism. Finally, we tested if expression of the CupB4 chaperone, which should facilitate export of CupB5 rather than its periplasmic accumulation, would decrease alginate production. Indeed, when we transformed PAO1-VE22 with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB4-H6, alginate production was suppressed and the mucoid phenotype of the parent strain was reversed (Fig. 6B). This result supports a model in which interactions between accumulated periplasmic CupB5 and periplasmic AlgW leads to induction of alginate production and mucoidy.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Based on results from a transposon screen in P. aeruginosa, we discovered that overexpression of CupB5, a protein normally secreted through the outer membrane by a chaperone-usher system, activates alginate production and results in mucoid colonies. CupB5-mediated mucoidy depends on known components of the AlgU stress-response pathway, including the AlgU transcription factor and the AlgW, MucP, and ClpXP proteases. Peptides from a region of CupB5 important for elevated alginate production in vivo stimulate cleavage of MucA by OMP-activated AlgW in vitro and partially relieve MucB inhibition of AlgW cleavage of MucA. Overexpression of either MucB or MucA in strains that overexpress CupB5 also reduces alginate production, supporting a model in which excess periplasmic CupB5 stimulates proteolytic cleavage of MucA by AlgW. We found that expression of HA-CupB51–491-H6 in PAO1 increased alginate production in vivo and demonstrated that a GYYYTVV peptide (corresponding to CupB5 residues 485–491) antagonized MucB inhibition in vitro. A peptide with the same composition as GYYYTVV but a scrambled sequence did not inhibit MucB. However, we also found that expression of HA-CupB51–489-H6 failed to increase alginate production in vivo, whereas a GYYYT peptide (corresponding to CupB5 residues 485–489) did antagonize MucB inhibition in vitro. This discrepancy between results in vivo and in vitro could arise because the GYYYT peptide in HA-CupB51–489-H6 is altered by proteolysis or is masked by tertiary structure, aggregation, or binding to another cellular component. We also note that expression of full-length HA-CupB5-H6 and truncated HA-CupB51–585-H6 resulted in somewhat higher alginate levels than expression of HA-CupB51–491-H6. This variation could arise from differences in expression levels, cellular interactions, or possibly as a consequence of additional peptide sequences in the longer proteins that facilitate pathway activation. We initially thought that CupB5 peptides might bind MucB and compete for binding to MucA in a manner analogous to LPS. However, neither GYYYTVV nor GYYYT peptides compete with MucA-agarose for MucB binding and saturating concentrations of these peptides only partially relieve MucB inhibition in vitro. Moreover, unlike LPS, GYYYTVV did not convert MucB dimers into tetramers. By themselves, CupB5 peptides activate AlgW cleavage in vitro far less well than the OMP-like WVF peptide. However, CupB5 peptides stimulate MucA cleavage by WVF-activated AlgW, suggesting that OMP-like and CupB5 peptides bind to distinct sites in AlgW but have a common effect of stabilizing the proteolytically active enzyme. The GYYYTVV sequence is conserved in CupB5 proteins from different strains of P. aeruginosa but not in CupB5 proteins from other Pseudomonas species (Fig. S3), and some Pseudomonas species have no CupB5 ortholog. Thus, CupB5 activation of AlgW is specific to P. aeruginosa. It remains to be determined if P. aeruginosa utilizes other proteins in this manner or if AlgW homologs in other bacteria are activated by more than one kind of peptide signal. Activation of the AlgU pathway requires one molecular signal (C-terminal OMP peptides) to activate site-1 cleavage of MucA by the AlgW protease and a second molecular signal (LPS) to relieve MucB inhibition of this cleavage. Overproduction of CupB5 can partially bypass this second requirement by helping OMP-bound AlgW compete with MucB for MucA binding and proteolysis. Expression of CupB5 under non-stress conditions increases alginate production similarly to non-stress expression of MucE (Qiu et al., 2007). In these experiments, a signal that directly antagonizes MucB inhibition could arise indirectly as a consequence of other molecules whose concentrations increase as a consequence of CupB5 or MucE expression or might always be present at some level in the periplasm. For example, some level of unassembled OMPs and LPS is probably always present in the periplasm. Notably, however, simultaneous expression of CupB5 and MucE results in higher levels of alginate, indicating that these signals activate the alginate pathway through synergistic mechanisms Although CupB5 peptides, OMP peptides, and LPS molecules function by different mechanisms to activate AlgW or relieve MucB inhibition, the molecular logic that gives rise to all three signals is similar. For example, stresses that compromise the transport to and outer-membrane assembly of OMPs and LPS, or that slow usher-mediated CupB5 secretion, would all lead to the periplasmic accumulation of these molecules and activation of the AlgU pathway. Indeed, we found that alginate production was suppressed in strains that overproduced the CupB4 chaperone, allowing export of CupB5. Certain stresses might only activate AlgW through OMP signals, whereas others require an enhanced response via CupB5 or possibly other proteins secreted through the outer membrane. Clearly, however, the AlgU system integrates multiple signals, each reporting on potential dysfunction in outer-membrane assembly, structure, and/or secretion. Dysfunction in just one pathway should give rise to a buffered AlgU response, whereas dysfunction affecting multiple pathways would elicit a robust AlgU response.",

Copyright notice ID: 4116675 MSID: MS604546 PMID: 24913916 The publisher's version of this article is available at Mol Microbiol Summary In P. aeruginosa, alginate overproduction, also known as mucoidy, is negatively regulated by the transmembrane protein MucA, which sequesters the alternative sigma factor AlgU. MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the chaperone-usher pathway gene cupB5. CupB5-dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in vitro. Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals. Keywords: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, alginate, MucA, MucB, CupB5, signal transductionIntroduction Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic human pathogen, capable of thriving in different environmental niches. Activation of the AlgU-regulated extracytoplasmic stress response results in the production of copious amounts of an exopolysaccharide called alginate, forming a capsule that protects the bacterium from the host-immune system. Alginate production by P. aeruginosa is a particular problem for patients with cystic fibrosis, whose dehydrated mucus-filled lungs provide an environment especially suited for bacterial infection (Folkesson et al., 2012). Nonmucoid strains initially colonize the lungs, and alginate overproduction caused by mutations in mucA results in a mucoid phenotype and a chronic lung infection (Ciofu et al., 2005; Hogardt et al., 2007; Mena et al., 2008). Among many roles in pathogenesis, alginate can promote adherence to lung epithelial cells, reduce the efficiency of phagocytosis, and protect bacteria from antibiotics (Govan and Deretic, 1996; Pier et al., 2001; Leid et al., 2005). The extracytoplasmic stress-response pathways in P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and other Gram-negative bacteria involve regulated intramembrane proteolysis and share common features. For example, outer-membrane and periplasmic stress initiates a proteolytic cascade that ultimately degrades a transmembrane anti-sigma factor and releases the sigma factor to up-regulate stress-response genes (Alba et al., 2002; Kanehara et al., 2002; Walsh et al., 2003; Akiyama et al., 2004; Flynn et al., 2004; Chaba et al., 2007). In P. aeruginosa, proteolysis of wild type MucA, the anti-sigma factor, releases the AlgU sigma factor, which enhances transcription of the genes responsible for alginate biosynthesis from the algD promoter (Martin et al., 1993; Wood et al., 2006). In P. aeruginosa, degradation of MucA is normally initiated by cleavage by the AlgW protease at site 1 near the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, continues with cleavage by the MucP protease at site 2 near the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, and is completed in the cytoplasm by AAA+ proteases such as ClpXP (Akiyama et al., 2004; Alba et al., 2002; Chaba et al., 2007; Flynn et al., 2004; Kanehara et al., 2002; Qiu et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2008b; Walsh et al., 2003). Two signals are required to initiate this proteolytic cascade. The C-terminal peptides of proteins that accumulate in the periplasm during stress, including outer-membrane proteins (OMPs), bind to the PDZ domains of the trimeric AlgW protease and allosterically activate site-1 cleavage of MucA, but MucB competes for MucA binding and can inhibit this cleavage (Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009). Recent studies show that lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a key component of the outer membrane, can bind MucB and cause release of MucA (Lima et al., 2013). Here, we identify CupB5 as a novel activator of the alginate-production pathway. CupB5, an adhesive protein, is a member of one of the chaperone/usher pathways (CupA-E) that mediate assembly of pili and play roles in bacterial pathogenesis, adhesion, and biofilm formation (Hull et al., 1981; Marklund et al., 1992; Soto and Hultgren, 1999; Vallet et al., 2001; Giraud et al., 2011; Mikkelsen et al., 2009). These secretion systems, which are best characterized in Gram-negative bacteria (Sauer et al., 2000; Waksman and Hultgren, 2009), contain a periplasmic chaperone that maintains proteins to be secreted in an unassembled state and an usher that transports these proteins through the outer membrane. We find that overexpression of CupB5 in the absence of its chaperone induces a mucoid phenotype in P. aeruginosa and provide evidence that a peptide signal in CupB5 enhances OMP-activated cleavage of MucA by AlgW, even in the presence of MucB, allowing initiation of AlgU signaling.Results Overexpression of CupB5 induces mucoidy To identify new alginate regulatory genes, we performed mariner-transposon mutagenesis (Wong and Mekalanos, 2000) in the nonmucoid P. aeruginosa reference strain PAO1. We isolated a mucoid variant (PAO1-VE22) and identified the site of a single-copy insertion by inverse PCR and Southern-blot analysis (data not shown). The transposon insertion was six base pairs before the TAG stop codon at the 3′ end of cupB4 (Fig. 1A) and introduced a σ70-dependent PGm promoter that drove expression of the gentamicin resistance cassette and downstream genes (Rubin et al., 1999). Alginate production by PAO1-VE22 (31 ± 1.5 μg/ml/OD600) was substantially higher than that of PAO1 (8.5 ± 0.02 μg/ml/OD600) after 24 h growth at 37°C. To test if altered expression of cupB4, cupB5, or cupB6 was responsible for the mucoidy of PAO1-VE22, we cloned each individual coding sequence with an N-terminal HA epitope and C-terminal H6 tag in pHERD20T under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter (Qiu et al., 2008a). Plasmids expressing the tagged variant of CupB5, but not of CupB4 or CupB6, induced mucoid conversion and high-level alginate production in PAO1 (Fig. 1B). Western-blot analysis indicated that the plasmid-expressed CupB4, CupB5, and CupB6 variants were detectable when overexpressed in PAO1, albeit with fragmentation of CupB5 (Fig. 1C). We conclude that enhanced expression of CupB5 or a CupB5 fragment induces mucoidy and increased alginate in PAO1-VE22. Fig. 1. Overproduction of CupB5 causes mucoid conversion in PAO1. Open in a new tab (A) Organization of the cupB1-cupB6 gene cluster (www.pseudomonas.com), and location of the transposon insertion site in PAO1-VE22. (B) Alginate production, measured using the carbazole assay, and colony phenotypes (M, mucoid; NM, nonmucoid) were assayed following transformation of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 with plasmid HERD20T or variants expressing HA-CupB4-H6, HA-CupB5-H6, or HA-CupB6-H6, and overnight growth of colonies on PIA plates (carbenecillin 300 μg ml−1, 0.1% L-arabinose) at 37°C. Values are averages ± SEM (n=3). (C) Cell lysates of PAO1 carrying appropriate plasmids were electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide gels, and Western-blots using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody were used to detect HA-CupB4-H6, HA-CupB5-H6, or HA-CupB6-H6. The rightmost lane shows that HA cross-reactive proteins were absent in PAO1 transformed with the pHERD20T empty-vector.Genetic requirements for CupB5-induced mucoidy Deletion of five single genes required for the AlgU response (algW, mucP, clpX, clpP, or algU) in PAO1 prevented mucoidy and high-level alginate production when HA-CupB5-H6 was overproduced from a plasmid in these strains (Fig. 2A). In-frame deletion of algW in PAO1-VE22 also prevented alginate overproduction and mucoidy, a phenotype that was complemented by plasmid expression of AlgW but not AlgW lacking its PDZ domain (Fig. 2B). Consistently, when AlgU-dependent promoters were fused to lacZ and introduced into PAO1-VE22 or PAO1-VE2, a strain in which AlgW is activated by overproduction of MucE (Qiu et al., 2007), β-galactosidase levels were increased markedly compared to the same promoter fusions in PAO1 (Fig. S1). CupB5 is normally an extracellular protein (Ruer et al., 2008; Vallet et al., 2001). However, its overexpression in the absence of corresponding levels of the CupB4 chaperone and usher could result in periplasmic accumulation that acts directly or indirectly through AlgW to activate alginate production. Fig. 2. Genetic requirements for CupB5-mediated alginate overproduction. Open in a new tab (A) Wild-type (WT) or mutant PAO1 strains were transformed with pHERD20 encoding HA-CupB5-H6, grown on PIA plates with 0.1% L-arabinose for 24 h at 37°C to induce HA-CupB5-H6 overexpression, and mucoid phenotypes and alginate production were determined. The algD gene encodes an enzyme required for alginate production. The algU, algW, mucP, clpX, and clpP genes are required for induction of algU-dependent alginate production. (B) Alginate production and mucoid phenotypes of different strains were measured after growth for 24 h at 37°C on PIA plates plus 300 μg m−1 carbenecillin and 0.1% L-Ara. In both panels, values are averages ± SEM (n=3).CupB5 contains an internal signal for alginate overproduction Because C-terminal sequences terminating with an aromatic residue and α-carboxylate can activate AlgW, we initially tested if the C-terminal residues of CupB5 (Asn1016-Ile1017-Trp1018) were responsible for activating AlgW and inducing mucoidy. However, overexpression of CupB5 variants with a C-terminal H6 tag or containing a deletion of the Asn1016-Ile1017-Trp1018 sequence and a C-terminal H6 tag still induced mucoidy in PAO1 (Table S1). Thus, the extreme C-terminal residues of CupB5 play little or no role in mediating alginate overproduction. Moreover, overproduction of variants containing just the N-terminal 491 residues of CupB5 also induced mucoidy (Table S1), indicating that a major inducing signal is located in this portion of the protein. Deletion analyses revealed that the Thr489-Val490-Val491 sequence of CupB5 appeared important for alginate overproduction. Specifically, overexpression of CupB51–491 produced substantially more alginate than overexpression of CupB51–489 or CupB51–488 (Fig. 3A), and Western blotting showed that these proteins were present at a similar intracellular levels (Fig. 3B). Cells expressing CupB51–490 also produced less alginate (Fig. 3A), but this protein appeared to be severely truncated by degradation (Fig. 3B). Based on these results, we hypothesized that the CupB5 activating signal included some or all of the Thr489-Val490-Val491 sequence. Fig. 3. Delineation of the CupB5 signal that activates alginate production. Open in a new tab (A) CupB5 variants with C-terminal truncations were cloned into pHERD20T, expressed in strain PAO1, and alginate production following growth in the presence of 1% L-arabinose was assayed. Proteins containing CupB5 residues 1–585 and 1–491 contain the complete GYYYTVV491 sequence motif. The remaining proteins contain only a portion of this motif. (B) Western-blot detection using anti-HA monoclonal antibody of truncated CupB5 variants.CupB5 peptides stimulate OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA and partially relieve MucB inhibition in vitro We initially tested if synthetic peptides including the Thr489-Val490-Val491 CupB5 sequence might stimulate alginate production in a manner analogous to OMPs by activating AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA. One peptide (GYYYTVV) corresponded to the seven C-terminal residues of CupB51–491, another (YVGYVTY) was a sequence-scrambled variant, and a third (GYYYT) corresponded to the C-terminus of CupB51–489, which did not stimulate alginate production in vivo. We assayed the kinetics of AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA in vitro by the production of acid-soluble peptide fragments in the presence of different concentrations of the CupB5 peptides. Each CupB5 peptide stimulated AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA to a small degree, but at far lower rates than a peptide (WVF) corresponding to the C-terminal residues of MucE, a potent activator of AlgW (Fig. 4A & 4B). Thus, the CupB5 peptides do not substitute for OMP-like peptides in robust activation of AlgW cleavage of MucA. Fig. 4. CupB5 peptides relieve MucB inhibition of MucA cleavage by AlgW. Open in a new tab (A) Cleavage of 35S-labelled MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) was assayed by the time-dependent release of acid-soluble peptides in the presence of either the OMP-like WVF peptide (400 μM), the wild-type GYYYT or GYYYTVV CupB5 peptides (400 μM), the sequence-scrambled YVGYVTY peptide (400 μM), or a buffer control. (B) Second-order rate constants for MucA cleavage were determined by incubating 35S-labelled MucA (20 μM) and AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) with different concentrations of WVF or CupB5 peptides and measuring the time-dependent increase in acid-soluble products. Rates were divided by the MucA and AlgW concentrations to determine activity. Lines are fits to the equation activity = basal + stimulated/(1+(Kact/[peptide])h). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2). (C) Second-order rate constants for cleavage of 35S-MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) were determined as described in panel B in the presence of different combinations of WVF peptide (110 μM), MucB (25 μM dimer), and wild-type or scrambled CupB5 peptides (405 μM). Values are averages of two or more independent trials ± SEM. (D) Second-order rate constants for cleavage of 35S-MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) and WVF peptide (150 μM) were determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of the GYYYT, GYYYTVV, or sequence-scrambled YVGYVTY peptides. Lines are fits to the Hill equation: rate = basal + Vmax/(1 + (Ks/[peptide])h). For GYYYT, Ks was 55 ± 13 μM and h was 2.1 ± 0.9. For GYYYTVV, Ks was 143 ± 31 μM and h was 3.5 ± 2.2.As expected from previous studies (Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009), addition of MucB suppressed cleavage of 35S-MucA by WVF-activated AlgW (Fig. 4C). Moreover, addition of just the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT CupB5 peptides did not result in AlgW cleavage of MucA when MucB was present (Fig. 4C). Next, we tested if the wild-type or scrambled CupB5 peptides could relieve MucB inhibition of AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA in the presence of the WVF activating peptide. Importantly, titration of GYYYTVV or GYYYT into reactions containing MucA, MucB, AlgW, and WVF peptide resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the rate of MucA cleavage (Fig. 4D). Almost no increase in MucA cleavage was observed with the scrambled YVGYVTY peptide (Fig. 4D), demonstrating sequence specificity. Interestingly, activation of MucA cleavage by GYYYT occurred at lower peptide concentrations and was less cooperative as judged by the Hill constant than activation by the GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. 4D). Thus, the C-terminal valine residues of GYYYTVV are not necessary for activation of MucA cleavage in the presence of MucB in vitro. Although the GYYYTVV and GYYYT peptides activated AlgW cleavage of MucA to similar levels in the presence of WVF peptide and MucB, these levels were approximately one-third of the MucA cleavage rate observed with WVF and AlgW alone (compare Figs. 4B and 4D). We conclude that the CupB5 peptides can partially relieve MucB inhibition of WVF-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA. Lipopolysaccharides bind MucB and competitively displace MucA (Lima et al., 2013). Because MucB normally binds peptide sequences in MucA, it seemed plausible that CupB5 peptides might also compete for MucA binding to MucB. We tested this possibility by assaying the ability of the CupB5 peptides to elute 35S-MucB from MucA that had been covalently bound to agarose resin (Fig. 5A). In this assay, the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment and free MucA efficiently competed with resin-bound MucA for MucB binding. However, incubation of 35S-MucB•MucA resin with the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT peptides resulted in no more 35S-MucB release than observed in the buffer control (Fig. 5A). This result strongly suggests that the CupB5 peptides do not relieve MucB inhibition by directly competing for its binding to MucA. Binding of the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment converts MucB dimers to tetramers (Lima et al., 2013). By contrast, incubation of MucB with GYYYTVV peptide resulted in no substantial change in elution during gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. S2). Fig. 5. CupB5 peptides do not compete with MucB for MucA binding but stimulate WVF-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA. Open in a new tab (A) Release of 35S-MucB from MucA-agarose following incubation with buffer, MucA (155 μM), L-IIA (20 mg/mL), or CupB5 peptides (~300 μM). For the CupB5 peptides, values are averages ± SEM (n=3). For L-IIA, the value is the average ± SEM (n=2). (B) Rates of cleavage by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) and WVF peptide (150 μM) were measured at different concentrations of 35S-MucA in the presence or absence of CupB5 peptides (300 μM). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2) and were fit to the Hill form of the Michaelis-Menten equation, rate = Vmax/(1 + (KM/[substrate])h). (C) Rates of cleavage of 35S-MucA (50 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) were assayed at difference concentrations of WVF peptide in the presence or absence of CupB5 peptides (300 μM). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2) and were fit to the equation rate = basal + Vmax/(1 + (Kact/[peptide])h). Without CupB5 peptide, h was 2.2 ± 1, Kact was 11 ± 2 μM, and Vmax was 1250 ± 150 M−1 s−1. With GYYYTVV peptide, h was 1.5 ± 0.8, Kact was 18 ± 7 μM, and Vmax was 2490 ± 490 M−1 s−1.Because CupB5 peptides did not strongly activate AlgW cleavage of MucA in the absence of the WVF peptide or release MucA from MucB, we speculated that they might act in concert with the WVF peptide to allow AlgW to bind and degrade MucA more efficiently and thus to compete better with MucB for the MucA substrate. This model predicts that MucA should be degraded at a faster rate in the presence of both the WVF and CupB5 peptides. Indeed, when we assayed the rate of cleavage of different concentrations of 35S-MucA by AlgW, faster cleavage was observed when both the WVF and wild-type CupB5 peptides were present compared to only the WVF peptide or the WVF peptide and scrambled CupB5 control peptide (Fig. 5B). We also measured the rate of AlgW cleavage of a fixed concentration of MucA in the presence of increasing concentrations of WVF peptide with or without additional GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. 5C). When GYYYTVV peptide was present, the maximum rate of MucA cleavage increased almost two-fold. We conclude that the CupB5 peptides and WVF peptide act synergistically to enhance AlgW cleavage of MucA, allowing better competition with MucB. In E. coli, RseA, RseB, and DegS are homologs of MucA, MucB, and AlgW. A YYF peptide efficiently activates DegS cleavage of RseA in the absence of RseB or in the presence of both RseB and lipopolysaccharides (Walsh et al., 2003; Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2007; Lima et al., 2013). The CupB5 peptides did not substantially stimulate cleavage of 35S-RseA by YYF-activated DegS in the presence of RseB (Fig. S3), suggesting that they do not interact with DegS. This result is not surprising, as DegS and AlgW share only 44% sequence homology.Suppressing and enhancing alginate production If CupB5 allows AlgW to compete more efficiently with MucB for MucA binding and cleavage, then overproduction of MucB in strain PAO1-VE22 would be expected to decrease alginate production. Indeed, plasmid-mediated MucB overproduction had this effect, as did plasmid-mediated overproduction of MucA (Fig. 6A). The latter result suggests that with enough additional uncleaved MucA, AlgU is efficiently inhibited even when more MucA is degraded than usual. Even the CupB5-induced elevated rate of AlgW cleavage of MucA in this strain must be too slow to free enough AlgU to fully enhance transcription of alginate biosynthesis genes. Fig. 6. Inducing and suppressing alginate production in P. aeruginosa strains. Open in a new tab (A) Strains overproducing CupB5 (PAO1-VE22) or MucE (PAO1-VE2) were transformed with plasmid HERD20T or variants overexpressing MucA or MucB, grown at 37°C for 24 h on PIA plates supplemented with 0.1% L-arabinose, and alginate production and colony phenotypes (M, mucoid; NM, nonmucoid) were assayed. (B) Alginate production and mucoid phenotypes were assayed in strains PAO1, PAO1-VE2 (mucE overexpressed), PAO1 mucB::tetR (mucB inactivated), and PAO1-VE22 (cupB5 overexpressed) transformed with the HERD20T plasmid vector or variants expressing HA-CupB4-H6 or HA-CupB5-H6. Values are averages ± SEM (n=3). Statistical significance was determine using the Student’s t-test (*P<0.05; **<0.005).Plasmid-expressed MucB or MucA also decreased alginate production in PAO1-VE2, a strain expressing higher MucE levels (Fig. 6A). The rate of AlgW cleavage of MucA in PAO1-VE2 is apparently too low to fully degrade the excess MucA, resulting in greater inhibition of AlgU and reduced alginate production. Excess MucB presumably outstrips the endogenous anti-MucB signals in PAO1-VE2 and mass action results in enhanced binding to MucA, reducing the rate of MucA cleavage by activated AlgW. To determine how simultaneous overexpression of MucE and CupB5 affected alginate levels,, we transformed PAO1-VE2 with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB5-H6. Notably, alginate levels in this strain were higher than in the empty-vector control (Fig. 6B), suggesting that activation of AlgW through MucE and through CupB5 occur synergistically. Our biochemical results predict that MucB should not be genetically required for CupB5-mediated pathway activation. To test this prediction, we used a transposon-insertion strain, PAO1-mucB::tetR, which displayed an elevated level of basal alginate production and mucoid phenotype (Fig. 6B). When we transformed PAO1-mucB::tetR with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB5-H6, alginate production increased compared to the empty-vector control (Fig. 6B), indicating that CupB5 overexpression induces pathway activation by a MucB-independent mechanism. Finally, we tested if expression of the CupB4 chaperone, which should facilitate export of CupB5 rather than its periplasmic accumulation, would decrease alginate production. Indeed, when we transformed PAO1-VE22 with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB4-H6, alginate production was suppressed and the mucoid phenotype of the parent strain was reversed (Fig. 6B). This result supports a model in which interactions between accumulated periplasmic CupB5 and periplasmic AlgW leads to induction of alginate production and mucoidy.Discussion Based on results from a transposon screen in P. aeruginosa, we discovered that overexpression of CupB5, a protein normally secreted through the outer membrane by a chaperone-usher system, activates alginate production and results in mucoid colonies. CupB5-mediated mucoidy depends on known components of the AlgU stress-response pathway, including the AlgU transcription factor and the AlgW, MucP, and ClpXP proteases. Peptides from a region of CupB5 important for elevated alginate production in vivo stimulate cleavage of MucA by OMP-activated AlgW in vitro and partially relieve MucB inhibition of AlgW cleavage of MucA. Overexpression of either MucB or MucA in strains that overexpress CupB5 also reduces alginate production, supporting a model in which excess periplasmic CupB5 stimulates proteolytic cleavage of MucA by AlgW. We found that expression of HA-CupB51–491-H6 in PAO1 increased alginate production in vivo and demonstrated that a GYYYTVV peptide (corresponding to CupB5 residues 485–491) antagonized MucB inhibition in vitro. A peptide with the same composition as GYYYTVV but a scrambled sequence did not inhibit MucB. However, we also found that expression of HA-CupB51–489-H6 failed to increase alginate production in vivo, whereas a GYYYT peptide (corresponding to CupB5 residues 485–489) did antagonize MucB inhibition in vitro. This discrepancy between results in vivo and in vitro could arise because the GYYYT peptide in HA-CupB51–489-H6 is altered by proteolysis or is masked by tertiary structure, aggregation, or binding to another cellular component. We also note that expression of full-length HA-CupB5-H6 and truncated HA-CupB51–585-H6 resulted in somewhat higher alginate levels than expression of HA-CupB51–491-H6. This variation could arise from differences in expression levels, cellular interactions, or possibly as a consequence of additional peptide sequences in the longer proteins that facilitate pathway activation. We initially thought that CupB5 peptides might bind MucB and compete for binding to MucA in a manner analogous to LPS. However, neither GYYYTVV nor GYYYT peptides compete with MucA-agarose for MucB binding and saturating concentrations of these peptides only partially relieve MucB inhibition in vitro. Moreover, unlike LPS, GYYYTVV did not convert MucB dimers into tetramers. By themselves, CupB5 peptides activate AlgW cleavage in vitro far less well than the OMP-like WVF peptide. However, CupB5 peptides stimulate MucA cleavage by WVF-activated AlgW, suggesting that OMP-like and CupB5 peptides bind to distinct sites in AlgW but have a common effect of stabilizing the proteolytically active enzyme. The GYYYTVV sequence is conserved in CupB5 proteins from different strains of P. aeruginosa but not in CupB5 proteins from other Pseudomonas species (Fig. S3), and some Pseudomonas species have no CupB5 ortholog. Thus, CupB5 activation of AlgW is specific to P. aeruginosa. It remains to be determined if P. aeruginosa utilizes other proteins in this manner or if AlgW homologs in other bacteria are activated by more than one kind of peptide signal. Activation of the AlgU pathway requires one molecular signal (C-terminal OMP peptides) to activate site-1 cleavage of MucA by the AlgW protease and a second molecular signal (LPS) to relieve MucB inhibition of this cleavage. Overproduction of CupB5 can partially bypass this second requirement by helping OMP-bound AlgW compete with MucB for MucA binding and proteolysis. Expression of CupB5 under non-stress conditions increases alginate production similarly to non-stress expression of MucE (Qiu et al., 2007). In these experiments, a signal that directly antagonizes MucB inhibition could arise indirectly as a consequence of other molecules whose concentrations increase as a consequence of CupB5 or MucE expression or might always be present at some level in the periplasm. For example, some level of unassembled OMPs and LPS is probably always present in the periplasm. Notably, however, simultaneous expression of CupB5 and MucE results in higher levels of alginate, indicating that these signals activate the alginate pathway through synergistic mechanisms Although CupB5 peptides, OMP peptides, and LPS molecules function by different mechanisms to activate AlgW or relieve MucB inhibition, the molecular logic that gives rise to all three signals is similar. For example, stresses that compromise the transport to and outer-membrane assembly of OMPs and LPS, or that slow usher-mediated CupB5 secretion, would all lead to the periplasmic accumulation of these molecules and activation of the AlgU pathway. Indeed, we found that alginate production was suppressed in strains that overproduced the CupB4 chaperone, allowing export of CupB5. Certain stresses might only activate AlgW through OMP signals, whereas others require an enhanced response via CupB5 or possibly other proteins secreted through the outer membrane. Clearly, however, the AlgU system integrates multiple signals, each reporting on potential dysfunction in outer-membrane assembly, structure, and/or secretion. Dysfunction in just one pathway should give rise to a buffered AlgU response, whereas dysfunction affecting multiple pathways would elicit a robust AlgU response.Experimental procedures Bacteria strains, plasmids, and growth conditions Bacteria strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table S2. Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37°C in Lennox broth (LB) or LB agar. P. aeruginosa strains were grown at 37°C in LB, Pseudomonas isolation broth (PIB, Alpha Bioscience) or on Pseudomonas isolation agar (PIA) plates (Difco). When required, the concentration of carbenicillin, tetracycline or gentamicin added to LB broth or plates was 100 μg ml−1, 20 μg ml−1, or 15 μg ml−1, respectively, and 300 μg ml−1, 150 μg ml&−1, or 200 μg ml−1 when added to PIB or PIA plates, respectively.Transposon mutagenesis Transposon mutagenesis was carried out via biparental conjugations using E. coli SM10 λpir carrying plasmid pFAC as the donor strain (Wong and Mekalanos, 2000) and PAO1 as the recipient strain. After incubating PAO1 and E. coli cells on LB agar plates at 37°C for 6 h, bacteria were collected, re-suspended in PBS and then plated onto PIA supplemented with gentamicin (200 μg ml−1). Mucoid colonies were identified. The chromosomal DNA of mucoid mutants was isolated using the QIAamp genomic DNA Extraction kit (Qiagen, USA). Approximately, 2 μg of DNA was digested with SalI overnight at 37°C, followed by purification and self-ligation using Fast-Link DNA ligase (Epicentre, USA). The circular closed DNA was used as a template for inverse PCR using GM3OUT and GM5OUT primers (Qiu et al., 2008b). The PCR products were purified and sequenced. Finally, Southern-blot hybridization was also conducted to monitor the copy number of transposon insertions using the Gmr gene as the probe (Head and Yu, 2004).Genetic construction, transformation and conjugation All DNA cloning was performed using PCR products digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the E. coli to Pseudomonas shuttle vector pHERD20T (Qiu et al., 2008a). All constructs of pHERD20T were sequenced to verify the correct DNA sequences. DNA sequencing was carried out by the Marshall University Genomics Core Facility. The primer sequences used for PCR cloning will be provided upon request. The transformation of One Shot TOP10 (Invitrogen, USA) was performed according to the supplier’s instruction. The transfer of pHERD20T and its derivatives was performed via triparental conjugation using the helper plasmid pRK2013 (Figurski and Helinski, 1979).Protein preparation and Western blotting For extraction of total cellular protein, PeriPreps™ Periplasting Kit (Epicentre, USA) was used. Bacteria were inoculated in PIB medium and incubated in shake culture for several hours, until the OD600 was ~0.6. At this point 0.1% L-arabinose was added to induce protein expression. Two hours after induction, bacteria were collected for cell lysis. The protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad Dc protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad). Equivalent proteins were mixed with 2×sample loading buffer and analyzed on 10–20% pre-cast SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane (GE) by electro-blotting for immunodetection. A primary antibody, rat Anti-HA (Roche, USA), was used at a dilution of 1:5000. Goat anti-rat immunoglobulin G (heavy and light chains) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce, USA) diluted 1: 5000 was used as the secondary antibody. Finally, the proteins on the membrane were visualized using the Amersham ECL kit (GE, USA).Alginate assay P. aeruginosa strains were grown at 37°C on triplicate PIA plates for 24 h. Bacteria were collected, suspended in PBS, and the OD600 was measured and adjusted to ~0.5 by addition of PBS. The suspensions were analyzed for the amount of uronic acid in comparison with a standard curve made with D-mannuronic acid lactone (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as described (Damron et al., 2009).β-galactosidase assay Pseudomonas strains carrying the lacZ vector pLP170 containing PalgU, and PalgD were cultured on PIA plates. After 24 h, bacteria were harvested, resuspended in PBS, and OD600 was measured and adjusted to ~0.3. Cells were then permeabilized using toluene, and β-galactosidase activity was measured at OD420 and OD550. The results in Miller Units were calculated according to the follow formula: Miller Units=1000×[OD 420−(1.75 × OD 550)]/[Reaction time (m) × Volume (ml) × OD 600] (Miller, 1972). The reported values represent an average of three independent experiments ± SEM.Proteins and peptides Purifications of P. aeruginosa MucA, MucB and AlgW and E. coli RseA, RseB and DegS were performed as described after plasmid-mediated overexpression in E. coli strain X90(DE3) (Sohn et al., 2007; Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009). Cultures containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin were grown to an OD600 of ~0.6, and protein expression was induced with 100 mM IPTG for two h before harvesting. Cells overexpressing MucB, AlgW, RseB or DegS were resuspended in native lysis buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 500 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole; E. coli proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole] and lysed by sonication. Cells overexpressing MucA or RseA were resuspended in denaturing lysis buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 8 M guanidine hydrochloride (pH 8)] and allowed to lyse at room temperature for 30 min. For all preparations, lysates were cleared by centrifugation and applied to Ni-NTA columns pre-equilibrated in native lysis buffer or denaturing lysis buffer. Columns were washed with lysis buffer and proteins eluted with elution buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 500 mM KCl, 500 mM imidazole; E. coli proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole]. Proteins were then dialyzed overnight against storage buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 200 mM KCl, 10% glycerol; E. coli proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA] and then again against fresh buffer before being stored frozen at −80°C. Prior to dialysis and storage, MucB and RseB were chromatographed on a size-exclusion column and only fractions corresponding to the dimer were collected. To obtain radiolabeled 35S-MucA,35S-RseA, or 35S-MucB, cells were grown in a defined rich medium (TekNova) lacking methionine and 35S-methionine was added upon induction. Purification of 35S-MucA and 35S-RseA then proceeded as described above for unlabeled MucA and RseA. Cells expressing 35S-MucB were lysed by the addition of lysozyme and three freeze-thaw cycles, and purification then proceeded as described above. All peptides were synthesized by GenScript and purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column. Purified products were lyophilized, stored at −20°C, then resuspended in storage buffer and used immediately. The L-IIA LPS fragment was a gift from Santiago Lima (MIT) (Lima et al., 2013).Cleavage assays Assays were performed as described (Sohn et al., 2007; Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009). Briefly, cleavage reactions were performed at 25°C in reaction buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 200 mM KCl, 10% glycerol; E. coli proteins: 150 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.3), 380 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 4 mM EDTA]. Reactions were initiated by the addition of protease and quenched after different times by addition of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Following centrifugation, acid-soluble reaction products were quantified by scintillation counting and compared to total radioactivity from control samples. Cleavage activity for peptide-activation assays and experiments involving MucB are reported as a second-order rate constant calculated by dividing the rate of substrate cleavage by the substrate and enzyme concentrations. Activity at different substrate concentrations for the Michaelis-Menten curve was calculated by dividing the rate of substrate cleavage by the enzyme concentration.MucA-resin assay Dry cyanogen-bromide activated Sepharose B4 resin (66 mg) was washed with 1 M HCl, equilibrated with coupling buffer [25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.3), 50 mM NaCl], and incubated with purified MucA (900 μg) for 1.5 hours. After removal of free protein, reactive groups on the resin were blocked by incubation in 0.5 M ethanolamine (pH 8.3) for 1 h. The MucA resin was washed, resuspended in coupling buffer, and stored at 4 °C. For assays, MucA resin was drained, incubated with a four-fold molar excess of 35S-MucB, washed again, incubated with ligand for 30 min, added to a pre-wetted 96-well Multiscreen HTS-HV Filter Plate (Millipore) over a 96-well polypropylene receiving plate (Greiner), and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 1 min. Elution of 35S-MucB was measured by scintillation counting and normalized by dividing by the total initial 35S-MucB radioactivity.Supplementary Material Supp FigureS1-S3 & TableS1-S2 MS604546-supplement-Supp_FigureS1-S3___TableS1-S2.pdf (587KB, pdf) Acknowledgments This work was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration West Virginia Space Grant Consortium (NASA WVSGC), the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF-YU11G0), and  grant AI-16892.

    "title": "Burn injury-associated MHCII(+) immune cell accumulation around lymphatic vessels of the mesentery and increased lymphatic endothelial permeability are blocked by doxycycline treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is theorized that toxic agents are transported from the hyperpermeable gut of burn victims through the lymph, to the systemic circulation, causing global injury. We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of “toxic lymph” following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase permeability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII+ immune cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed significantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (∼1.5-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.

    "introduction": "Introduction The function of the lymphatic system is to maintain fluid and macromolecular homeostasis, regulate the trafficking of antigens and immune cells, and condition the immune response.1–3 When these functions are interrupted, the result is often edema accompanied by inflammation and disruption of the immune response in the tissue served by those lymphatics. Examples of this include lymphedema and its association with cellulitis or lymphangiectasia with accompanying disturbances in gut immune responses.4–9 Because the lymphatic system is a regulator of fluid physiological homeostasis and also immunological regulation, local disturbances in lymphatic function may have far-reaching systemic effects.10–12 Burn injuries are a common traumatic injury and carry a substantial morbidity and mortality risk. According to the American Burn Association, almost 500,000 Americans sustained significant burns in 2016.13–15 The mortality rate following burn (including all forms of burn) is 3.3%, whereas those burned by fire or flames have a higher mortality rate of 5.8%.14,15 The risk of death associated with burn increases with the size of the burn sustained (% of surface area).16 The average cost of hospital stay for burn victims in 2016 was over $250,000.17–19 Burns can lead to substantial health consequences, including scarring, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, multiple organ failure, and long-term fatigue.20–22 The association of some of these sequelae with the immune system activation and dysregulation indicates that an exploration of the response of immune mediators warrants further exploration. Traumatic injuries, especially burn, are complex chains of pathologies and physiologic responses.23–25 These pathologies often result in increases in circulating cytokines, chemokines, and adipokines, which cause immune activation and increased vascular permeability.26–28 Additionally, most major trauma is accompanied by increased intestinal permeability and translocation of intestinal contents, including constituents of the microbiota, and associated development of cytotoxic lymph.29,30 Cytotoxic lymph is so named because of its ability to cause dysfunction in a number of different cell types, including cardiomyocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells.12,31–37 Vascular endothelial dysfunction, and by extension vascular dysfunction, is a major concern after trauma and results in massively increased vascular permeability. This permeability can lead to reduced blood pressure, decreased perfusion, and massive edema, all of which have detrimental effects at sites distant from the injury. Historically, studies have focused on blood vasculature not the lymphatic vasculature in traumatic injury. More recently there have been studies examining the effect of trauma on lymphatic function. However, the techniques used could only demonstrate differential regulation of lymphatic flow after different forms of trauma.38–40 During severe burn injuries, lymph flow is increased dramatically, likely due to increased blood vessel leakage and increased interstitial pressures, rapidly causing distal pathologies after insult.40,41 The role of lymph as a major contributor to global pathologies after trauma has been supported by animal studies, primarily in models of burn injury and hemorrhagic shock. While the initiating injury for these forms of trauma is vastly different, the resulting pathologies are very similar.23,29,40,42,43 Both burns and hemorrhage are associated with increased intestinal epithelial permeability and the development of cytotoxic lymph.27,43–45 However, it is unclear what processes are mediating these effects. The first organs to be affected after burn injury and hemorrhagic shock are the heart and the lungs, which are the first organs to receive lymph returned to the great veins in the upper chest.29 In hemorrhagic shock, ligation of major lymphatic conduit vessels, the cisterna chyli and the thoracic duct, reduced or eliminated heart and lung injury, confirming the involvement of lymph in these processes.29,31,46 Our previous findings show that lymphatic vessels have a unique and larger immunological fingerprint compared with either arteries or veins.47 This is due to the association of cells of the innate immune system lying in close proximity to and in some cases integrated into the lymphatic vessel wall. One particular population, MHCII+ CD11c− cells, is extremely responsive to inflammatory stimuli. In a model of intestinal inflammation, we have shown that this population begins to increase around the lymphatic vessels in as little as 1 hour after insult.48 More importantly, when this cell population increases, there is an immediate shift in the environment surrounding the lymphatic vessel, with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines,48 which would affect lymph composition.4,10,49–51 We hypothesize that burn injury induces leakage of lymph from lymphatic vessels and that this will cause an increase in the number of MHCII+ immune cells to traffic to the perilymphatic space.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animal care and use All animal procedures followed  guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals as well as the rules of the Scott and White and Texas A&M Institutional Care and Use Committees. Animals used in this study were also used in a separate study to examine blood vascular permeability in burn injury and hemorrhagic shock. Induction of burn Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350–400 g) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Urethane (1.25 g/kg) and prepared for surgery by removing the hair from the abdomen, inner thigh of the right rear leg, and throat. Incisions at the throat and thigh were made to access the jugular vein and femoral artery and these vessels were cannulated and secured in place by 6–0 silk sutures. All bleeding were arrested by electrocauterization. Animals were pretreated 1 hour before induction of burn with either 30 mg/kg doxycycline or sterile saline (in 1 mL). Sterile saline was infused through the jugular vein to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) during the course of the experiment and blood was drawn and MAP was measured from the femoral artery. Animals were placed into an adjustable floating shield that exposed 30% of the surface area of the animal and were exposed to 100°C water for 10 seconds resulting in third-degree equivalent burn on 30% of the body. Immediately after inducing burn injury the mesentery of the animal was exposed through a midline laparotomy and a loop of intestine was fixed to a warmed dissection board. The animals were allowed to equilibrate on the dissection board for 30 minutes before the start of the procedure. Blood pressure was maintained at 80 mmHg by perfusion of sterile saline and monitored for 1 hour. After 1 hour, blood was drawn from the animal to exsanguinate and for serum. The small intestine and mesentery were pinned out into Sylgard® 184-coated dishes and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hours and then the mesentery was trimmed away from the gut wall and prepared for immunohistochemistry. Whole-mount immunohistochemistry/quantification of immune cells The mesenteric tissue harvested from the burn protocols was excised and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times for 5 minutes each after fixation and placed into PBS with 0.01 Triton X-100 for 1 hour to permeabilize the tissue. After permeabilization, the tissue was placed in 5% normal goat serum in PBS blocking solution for2 hours. The tissue was then incubated overnight at 4°C in a 1:200 dilution of anti-MHCII antibody (SantaCruz 10.3-6) or mouse IgG control in ProHisto© Amplifying Antibody Dilution Buffer. The tissue was washed three times using ProHisto wash buffer for 10 minutes and then secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG2a Alexa Fluor© 488) was added at 1:200 dilution in ProHisto Amplifying Antibody Dilution Buffer for 2 hours at room temperature in a light-proof container. The tissue was then washed following the same procedure for the primary antibody and the tissue was mounted by being sandwiched between 24 × 60 mm number 1 coverslips in ProLong Gold© Antifade Reagent. The whole-mount tissue was imaged using a Leica AOBS PS2 confocal microscope with a 40 × water immersion lens with the airy disk set to 1 using 0.33um step size. Laser power was set to 50% and the photo multiplier tube was adjusted to yield ∼10% saturated pixels at the most intense fluorescence per stack. Presence of a lymphatic vessel was confirmed by observation of bulbous valve regions by transmitted light and lack of red blood cells in the lumen. After image acquisition the image stacks were processed using ImageJ software (), where they were despeckled, smoothed, and merged into an average projection. The resulting projections were all then adjusted for brightness and contrast to the same levels. Blinded scorers then counted the number of MHCII+ cells that were directly interacting with the vessel (defined by cells breaching the border of the vessel in the stack). ImageJ was used to measure area (XYX), circularity (how closely a shape matches a circular ellipse), and aspect ratio (the ratio of the longest span of the shape versus the longest perpendicular measurement) of the cells interfacing with the vessels. Permeability studies Primary rat lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were isolated from mesenteric lymphatics and cultured as previously described.52 The LECs were grown to visual confluence in 24-well transwell inserts (PTFE; 0.4 μm pore size, Corning) coated with 2% porcine gelatin. Seventy-two hours after visual confluence, cells were placed into DMEM without Phenol Red with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and a mix of penicillin/streptomycin (starvation media) for 2 hours (200 μL in the upper chamber and 600 μL in the lower chamber). After starvation, the 100 μL of serum isolated from sham-operated animals, burn animals, or doxycycline-treated burn animals was added to the upper (luminal) chamber of the transwell. The wells were allowed to incubate with the serum for 1 hour then 10 μL of 10 mg/mL fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) was added to the upper chamber and allowed to incubate an additional 1 hour. At the end of the incubation, 10 μL of the medium was removed from the lower (abluminal) chamber and mixed with 90 μL of Milli-Q water and placed in a black-walled microplate. The plates were then read on a fluorescence-capable microplate reader with 488/504 nm excitation/emission pair. Lymphatic endothelial VE-cadherin staining Rat mesenteric LEC as used for the permeability studies were grown on 12 mm glass coverslips in 24-well culture dishes until confluent. The culture medium was removed and replaced with 400 μL of starvation medium as described for the permeability assays 2 hours before treatment. Two hundred microliters of serum from sham, doxycycline-treated sham, burn, or doxycycline-treated burn was added to the wells and allowed to incubate for 2 hours. At the end of treatment, the medium was removed from the wells and the cells washed three times with PBS before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 2 hours. Cells were then washed with PBS three times and blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 2 hours. The cells were then incubated in primary antibody (mouse anti-VE-cadherin; Santa Cruz H-72) at 1:200 dilution overnight at 4°C in 0.5% goat serum/0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100. Secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 488; Life Technologies) was added to the cells at a 1:500 dilution in PBS and allowed to incubate for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells were washed in PBS 3 times and the coverslips were removed from the 24-well plates and mounted on slides using ProLong Gold without DAPI. Slides were imaged using an Olympus wide-field BX-12 microscope. Breaks in VE-cadherin staining per 40 × field of view were quantified. Statistical analysis All data were analyzed using GraphPad InStat© software using ANOVA tests and Student's t-test depending upon the number of variables. Where appropriate, Dunnett's post-test was performed to compare all data to the control. Sample sizes were determined by power analysis assuming a 20% change in values of cell number and a 10% deviation around the mean.",
    "results": "Results We analyzed the number of MHCII+ cells in the mesentery and their association with the lymphatic vessels in that tissue (Fig. 1a, b). Burn injury significantly increased the number of MHCII+ cells that interacted with the lymphatic vessels compared with sham control (1.50 ± 0.17-fold) (Fig. 1c). The number of cells that did not interface with the vessel in burn injury also significantly increased (2.29 ± 0.49-fold) (Fig. 1d). The size (area) of MHCII+ cells associated with the lymphatic vessels changed dramatically after burn injury, increasing 2.59 ± 0.32-fold (Fig. 2c). Cells also increased their perimeter after burn relative to sham (Fig. 2d); however, the changes in area and perimeter were not proportional suggesting the cells changed their shape in addition to size (Fig. 2e). We confirmed there was an elongation of the MHCII+ cells along the axis of the vessel in burn injury as detected by an increase in aspect ratio (ratio of the longest axis to shortest axis) (Fig. 2f).

Doxycycline treatment reduced the accumulation of MHCII+ immune cells on and near the mesenteric lymphatic vessel wall after burn injury to control levels (Fig. 5a). Additionally, doxycycline reduced the number of immune cells in the periphery of the mesenteric tissue to levels between control and burn levels (1.47 ± 0.23-fold increase over control), but not significantly different from either control (sham) or burn alone (Fig. 5b). Despite the reduction in the number of cells, the morphology of the cells changed, with cells increasing in size to a greater extent than in untreated burn (3.57 ± 0.27 vs. 2.59.64 ± 0.32-fold) (Fig. 5d).

    "discussion": "Discussion Burns are complex injuries that require extensive treatment for the primary insult as well as the secondary global pathologies, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.29 Current evidence from animal models suggests that there is a gut/mesenteric lymph axis that is imbalanced during these injuries caused by increased intestinal epithelial injury resulting in generation of toxic lymph.26,32,43,44 This toxic lymph is the driving force of secondary injury in distal tissues following burns in experimental models and diverting lymph flow so that it does not return to the blood circulation blocking distal injury.26,31,42,43 There is still debate as to what causes lymph from the gut to be toxic after traumatic injury. However, many studies implicate gut tissue-derived cytokines, other immunoactive substances (chemokines, adipokines, TLR agonists etc.), and the immune cells residing in those tissues, but there has not been an extensive characterization of those populations to date.26,30,42,44 Our recent findings that there is a resident mixed population of immune cells in, on, and surrounding lymphatic vessels lead us to examine the numbers of a representative population of those immune cells along the mesenteric lymphatic vessels after burn injury and if it could be regulated pharmacologically (Fig 6).47 FIG. 6. Open in a new tab Overview of the theorized changes that occur around lymphatic vessels during burn injury. As a quiescent state changes to an inflamed state due to burn injury, lymphatic permeability increases allowing lymph contents escape the vessel to form a chemoattractive gradient that guides cells that escape from nearby blood vessels to the lymphatic vessel. Our previous work indicates that the population of MHCII+ immune cells rapidly increases in number along the lymphatic vessel wall following injury. We have previously used this cell population as an indicator of immune cell attraction and accumulation on lymphatic vessels in a number of different pathologies, including ageing, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. This subtype of immune cell is highly MHCII+, CD74+, and in the rat is CD11c−, CD206± (proportions can change depending upon tissue state), CD86±, CD83±, CD68+, and CCR6± (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/lrb). This suggests that we are looking at a relatively diverse set of populations capable of antigen presentation or a spectrum of a single population of antigen-presenting cells. Given that these cells are highly MHCII+, we assume that they are professional antigen-presenting cells that are unique in that they traffic to the lymphatic vessel wall as opposed to entering the initial lymphatics and then moving to the lymph node. Our study demonstrates that these cells can take up and process antigen carried in the lymph stream (Supplementary Fig. S2). This suggests that they may be able to present antigen and activate immune responses in the peripheral tissues. However, these studies have not demonstrated which cell type these lymphatic vessel wall-trafficking antigen-presenting cells interact with. In this pathology, these MHCII+ cells could likely be presenting antigen and activation signals to cells such as tissue-resident T cells (such as TH-17 and γδ T-cells) that have been shown to play a major role in the pathology of burn.53 If this were the case, this would represent a major change in the paradigm of antigen trafficking and immune activation. After burn injury, the number of MHCII+ cells along the lymphatic vessels increased dramatically in a manner similar to but even more profound than what we have observed in our models of intestinal inflammation induced by TNBS. In our previous work, we observed that lymphatic dysfunction correlates to the density of immune cells in close proximity to the outside of lymphatic vessels on a near 1:1 negative ratio.48 Recent findings have shown that lymphatic contractile function (not transport) as measured ex vivo is compromised after burn injury and in the light of this data and our previous studies suggest that this impaired contractile function may be caused by the accumulation of immune cells surrounding the vessels and altering the local environment.40,48 There was also an increase in the number of MHCII+ immune cells in the periphery of the mesenteric tissue that was proportionally greater than the increase along the lymphatic vessels. Thus, we assume that there is some attractive signal carried in lymph that causes cells to home to the external wall of the lymphatic vessels after exiting the blood vasculature during inflammation and injury and that the number of cells leaving the blood vasculature increases at a greater rate than the rate of migration to the lymphatic vessels and possibly leaving the tissue. The exact signal that induces the migration of cells to the lymphatic vessels is currently not known, and we hypothesize that it is carried in the lymph itself. Given our previous data in a model of inflammatory bowel disease, we may presume that it is likely a chemokine signal such as granulocyte/monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) released by activated immune cells in the gut and carried in the lymph.48 However, it cannot be assumed that chemokines such as GM-CSF are the only likely chemoattractants released from the lymph as there are likely many other signals also carried in the lymph stream. We assume that the signal that recruits these cells is carried in the lymph because of evidence from our study. The first piece of evidence is that serum from burn animals induces lymphatic endothelial permeability to increase (Fig. 3) and there is concomitant evidence that there is disruption of the continuity of endothelial cell–cell junctions in the LECs in vitro in response to burn serum (Fig. 4). Disruption of lymphatic endothelial junctional components is not surprising and is similar to findings in blood vascular endothelial cells.54,55 Second, doxycycline (an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases) inhibits the increase in lymphatic endothelial permeability and prevents the disruption of lymphatic endothelial junction stability. Third, doxycycline completely inhibits the accumulation of immune cells on the lymphatic vessels during burn, but only partially blocks the accumulation of cells in the periphery of the mesentery as permeability plays a partial role in the escape of immune cells from the blood vasculature. Fourth, cells already directly in contact with the lymphatic vessels, therefore capable of sampling lymph, change their morphology despite doxycycline treatment. Taken together, this is strong evidence that the chemoattractive force for these cells to migrate to the lymphatic vessels primarily originates in the lymph and not produced by cells that are part of or associated with the vessels, although it cannot be discounted that they may play a small role. The change in the morphology of the perilymphatic MHCII+ cells in burn injury was dramatic, with cells becoming larger, more elongated, and oriented along the vessels, which are signs of macrophage activation.56,57 Activation of these cells along the vessels may result in the further generation and addition to the lymph of inflammatory mediators that are problematic in the treatment of burn. In our previous studies, we found that the genes for the inflammatory mediators, tumor necrosis factor-α and inducible nitrous oxide synthase, were upregulated along the vessels due to migration of the immune cells to the perilymphatic space. Due to the proximity of the cells to the lymphatic vessels it is highly likely that the cellular products of these cells are carried immediately into the lymph stream with little dilution by other cellular products (such as lymph generated at initial lymphatics). The morphology of the cells on the mesenteric lymphatic vessels following doxycycline treatment during burn also changes, but in different ways that in burn alone. The cells present after doxycycline-treated burn increase in size to a greater degree than that of the burn alone group, while the aspect ratio decreased to levels below control. These size changes suggest that, despite the reduced number of cells being attracted to the vessels, the immune cells that are present are being activated. Thus, these cells are likely sampling lymph “normally,” like we have observed in our antigen-trafficking studies (Supplementary Fig. S2). The decreased aspect ratio of the cells is difficult to interpret, given that an increased score would suggest a closer association with the vessel axis, while a reduced score suggests a nonspecific enlargement. The reduced score we found in doxycycline-treated burn cells may be evidence that these local lymphatic-associated immune cells can be activated in response to an aberrant signal in lymph, but need a secondary signal which may come from outside the vessel to increase their association with the vessel. This signal could originate from another immune cell population that would normally arrive after injury. It is widely accepted that toxic lymph develops in models of trauma and induces dysfunction in a number of organs and cell types. We have found that during burn injury there is increased potential for lymphatic leakage and this leakage is associated with increased recruitment of MHCII+ cells along the mesenteric lymphatic vessels, and these cells alter their morphology suggesting inflammatory activation. We know from our previous work that cells much like these express high levels of inflammatory mediators and given their proximity to the lymphatic vessels, these cells likely influence the makeup of the lymph and the function of the lymphatic vessels during injury. This influence may be a factor in the development of toxic lymph after trauma that has not been studied.",

Issue date 2018 Feb 1. Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  Copyright notice ID: 5810432 PMID: 29359999 Abstract It is theorized that toxic agents are transported from the hyperpermeable gut of burn victims through the lymph, to the systemic circulation, causing global injury. We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of “toxic lymph” following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase permeability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII+ immune cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed significantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (∼1.5-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.

Examples of this include lymphedema and its association with cellulitis or lymphangiectasia with accompanying disturbances in gut immune responses.4–9 Because the lymphatic system is a regulator of fluid physiological homeostasis and also immunological regulation, local disturbances in lymphatic function may have far-reaching systemic effects.10–12 Burn injuries are a common traumatic injury and carry a substantial morbidity and mortality risk. According to the American Burn Association, almost 500,000 Americans sustained significant burns in 2016.13–15 The mortality rate following burn (including all forms of burn) is 3.3%, whereas those burned by fire or flames have a higher mortality rate of 5.8%.14,15 The risk of death associated with burn increases with the size of the burn sustained (% of surface area).16 The average cost of hospital stay for burn victims in 2016 was over $250,000.17–19 Burns can lead to substantial health consequences, including scarring, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, multiple organ failure, and long-term fatigue.20–22 The association of some of these sequelae with the immune system activation and dysregulation indicates that an exploration of the response of immune mediators warrants further exploration. Traumatic injuries, especially burn, are complex chains of pathologies and physiologic responses.23–25 These pathologies often result in increases in circulating cytokines, chemokines, and adipokines, which cause immune activation and increased vascular permeability.26–28 Additionally, most major trauma is accompanied by increased intestinal permeability and translocation of intestinal contents, including constituents of the microbiota, and associated development of cytotoxic lymph.29,30 Cytotoxic lymph is so named because of its ability to cause dysfunction in a number of different cell types, including cardiomyocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells.12,31–37 Vascular endothelial dysfunction, and by extension vascular dysfunction, is a major concern after trauma and results in massively increased vascular permeability. This permeability can lead to reduced blood pressure, decreased perfusion, and massive edema, all of which have detrimental effects at sites distant from the injury. Historically, studies have focused on blood vasculature not the lymphatic vasculature in traumatic injury. More recently there have been studies examining the effect of trauma on lymphatic function. However, the techniques used could only demonstrate differential regulation of lymphatic flow after different forms of trauma.38–40 During severe burn injuries, lymph flow is increased dramatically, likely due to increased blood vessel leakage and increased interstitial pressures, rapidly causing distal pathologies after insult.40,41 The role of lymph as a major contributor to global pathologies after trauma has been supported by animal studies, primarily in models of burn injury and hemorrhagic shock. While the initiating injury for these forms of trauma is vastly different, the resulting pathologies are very similar.23,29,40,42,43 Both burns and hemorrhage are associated with increased intestinal epithelial permeability and the development of cytotoxic lymph.27,43–45 However, it is unclear what processes are mediating these effects. The first organs to be affected after burn injury and hemorrhagic shock are the heart and the lungs, which are the first organs to receive lymph returned to the great veins in the upper chest.29 In hemorrhagic shock, ligation of major lymphatic conduit vessels, the cisterna chyli and the thoracic duct, reduced or eliminated heart and lung injury, confirming the involvement of lymph in these processes.29,31,46 Our previous findings show that lymphatic vessels have a unique and larger immunological fingerprint compared with either arteries or veins.47 This is due to the association of cells of the innate immune system lying in close proximity to and in some cases integrated into the lymphatic vessel wall. One particular population, MHCII+ CD11c− cells, is extremely responsive to inflammatory stimuli. In a model of intestinal inflammation, we have shown that this population begins to increase around the lymphatic vessels in as little as 1 hour after insult.48 More importantly, when this cell population increases, there is an immediate shift in the environment surrounding the lymphatic vessel, with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines,48 which would affect lymph composition.4,10,49–51 We hypothesize that burn injury induces leakage of lymph from lymphatic vessels and that this will cause an increase in the number of MHCII+ immune cells to traffic to the perilymphatic space.Materials and Methods Animal care and use All animal procedures followed  guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals as well as the rules of the Scott and White and Texas A&M Institutional Care and Use Committees. Animals used in this study were also used in a separate study to examine blood vascular permeability in burn injury and hemorrhagic shock.Induction of burn Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350–400 g) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Urethane (1.25 g/kg) and prepared for surgery by removing the hair from the abdomen, inner thigh of the right rear leg, and throat. Incisions at the throat and thigh were made to access the jugular vein and femoral artery and these vessels were cannulated and secured in place by 6–0 silk sutures. All bleeding were arrested by electrocauterization. Animals were pretreated 1 hour before induction of burn with either 30 mg/kg doxycycline or sterile saline (in 1 mL). Sterile saline was infused through the jugular vein to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) during the course of the experiment and blood was drawn and MAP was measured from the femoral artery. Animals were placed into an adjustable floating shield that exposed 30% of the surface area of the animal and were exposed to 100°C water for 10 seconds resulting in third-degree equivalent burn on 30% of the body. Immediately after inducing burn injury the mesentery of the animal was exposed through a midline laparotomy and a loop of intestine was fixed to a warmed dissection board. The animals were allowed to equilibrate on the dissection board for 30 minutes before the start of the procedure. Blood pressure was maintained at 80 mmHg by perfusion of sterile saline and monitored for 1 hour. After 1 hour, blood was drawn from the animal to exsanguinate and for serum. The small intestine and mesentery were pinned out into Sylgard® 184-coated dishes and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hours and then the mesentery was trimmed away from the gut wall and prepared for immunohistochemistry.Whole-mount immunohistochemistry/quantification of immune cells The mesenteric tissue harvested from the burn protocols was excised and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times for 5 minutes each after fixation and placed into PBS with 0.01 Triton X-100 for 1 hour to permeabilize the tissue. After permeabilization, the tissue was placed in 5% normal goat serum in PBS blocking solution for2 hours. The tissue was then incubated overnight at 4°C in a 1:200 dilution of anti-MHCII antibody (SantaCruz 10.3-6) or mouse IgG control in ProHisto© Amplifying Antibody Dilution Buffer. The tissue was washed three times using ProHisto wash buffer for 10 minutes and then secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG2a Alexa Fluor© 488) was added at 1:200 dilution in ProHisto Amplifying Antibody Dilution Buffer for 2 hours at room temperature in a light-proof container. The tissue was then washed following the same procedure for the primary antibody and the tissue was mounted by being sandwiched between 24 × 60 mm number 1 coverslips in ProLong Gold© Antifade Reagent. The whole-mount tissue was imaged using a Leica AOBS PS2 confocal microscope with a 40 × water immersion lens with the airy disk set to 1 using 0.33um step size. Laser power was set to 50% and the photo multiplier tube was adjusted to yield ∼10% saturated pixels at the most intense fluorescence per stack. Presence of a lymphatic vessel was confirmed by observation of bulbous valve regions by transmitted light and lack of red blood cells in the lumen. After image acquisition the image stacks were processed using ImageJ software (), where they were despeckled, smoothed, and merged into an average projection. The resulting projections were all then adjusted for brightness and contrast to the same levels. Blinded scorers then counted the number of MHCII+ cells that were directly interacting with the vessel (defined by cells breaching the border of the vessel in the stack). ImageJ was used to measure area (XYX), circularity (how closely a shape matches a circular ellipse), and aspect ratio (the ratio of the longest span of the shape versus the longest perpendicular measurement) of the cells interfacing with the vessels.Permeability studies Primary rat lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were isolated from mesenteric lymphatics and cultured as previously described.52 The LECs were grown to visual confluence in 24-well transwell inserts (PTFE; 0.4 μm pore size, Corning) coated with 2% porcine gelatin. Seventy-two hours after visual confluence, cells were placed into DMEM without Phenol Red with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and a mix of penicillin/streptomycin (starvation media) for 2 hours (200 μL in the upper chamber and 600 μL in the lower chamber). After starvation, the 100 μL of serum isolated from sham-operated animals, burn animals, or doxycycline-treated burn animals was added to the upper (luminal) chamber of the transwell. The wells were allowed to incubate with the serum for 1 hour then 10 μL of 10 mg/mL fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) was added to the upper chamber and allowed to incubate an additional 1 hour. At the end of the incubation, 10 μL of the medium was removed from the lower (abluminal) chamber and mixed with 90 μL of Milli-Q water and placed in a black-walled microplate. The plates were then read on a fluorescence-capable microplate reader with 488/504 nm excitation/emission pair.Lymphatic endothelial VE-cadherin staining Rat mesenteric LEC as used for the permeability studies were grown on 12 mm glass coverslips in 24-well culture dishes until confluent. The culture medium was removed and replaced with 400 μL of starvation medium as described for the permeability assays 2 hours before treatment. Two hundred microliters of serum from sham, doxycycline-treated sham, burn, or doxycycline-treated burn was added to the wells and allowed to incubate for 2 hours. At the end of treatment, the medium was removed from the wells and the cells washed three times with PBS before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 2 hours. Cells were then washed with PBS three times and blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 2 hours. The cells were then incubated in primary antibody (mouse anti-VE-cadherin; Santa Cruz H-72) at 1:200 dilution overnight at 4°C in 0.5% goat serum/0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100. Secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 488; Life Technologies) was added to the cells at a 1:500 dilution in PBS and allowed to incubate for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells were washed in PBS 3 times and the coverslips were removed from the 24-well plates and mounted on slides using ProLong Gold without DAPI. Slides were imaged using an Olympus wide-field BX-12 microscope. Breaks in VE-cadherin staining per 40 × field of view were quantified.Statistical analysis All data were analyzed using GraphPad InStat© software using ANOVA tests and Student's t-test depending upon the number of variables. Where appropriate, Dunnett's post-test was performed to compare all data to the control. Sample sizes were determined by power analysis assuming a 20% change in values of cell number and a 10% deviation around the mean.Results We analyzed the number of MHCII+ cells in the mesentery and their association with the lymphatic vessels in that tissue (Fig. 1a, b). Burn injury significantly increased the number of MHCII+ cells that interacted with the lymphatic vessels compared with sham control (1.50 ± 0.17-fold) (Fig. 1c). The number of cells that did not interface with the vessel in burn injury also significantly increased (2.29 ± 0.49-fold) (Fig. 1d). The size (area) of MHCII+ cells associated with the lymphatic vessels changed dramatically after burn injury, increasing 2.59 ± 0.32-fold (Fig. 2c). Cells also increased their perimeter after burn relative to sham (Fig. 2d); however, the changes in area and perimeter were not proportional suggesting the cells changed their shape in addition to size (Fig. 2e). We confirmed there was an elongation of the MHCII+ cells along the axis of the vessel in burn injury as detected by an increase in aspect ratio (ratio of the longest axis to shortest axis) (Fig. 2f).

N = 3 with each N made up of the average of three images per sample. All data were analyzed by ANOVA with Dunnett's post-test. *denotes significant change from sham (p < 0.05).Doxycycline treatment reduced the accumulation of MHCII+ immune cells on and near the mesenteric lymphatic vessel wall after burn injury to control levels (Fig. 5a). Additionally, doxycycline reduced the number of immune cells in the periphery of the mesenteric tissue to levels between control and burn levels (1.47 ± 0.23-fold increase over control), but not significantly different from either control (sham) or burn alone (Fig. 5b). Despite the reduction in the number of cells, the morphology of the cells changed, with cells increasing in size to a greater extent than in untreated burn (3.57 ± 0.27 vs. 2.59.64 ± 0.32-fold) (Fig. 5d). In addition to reducing the accumulation of immune cells on and around the lymphatic vessels, doxycycline completely inhibited the ability of burn serum to induce LEC monolayer permeability, but had no effect on sham serum (Fig. 3).

All data were analyzed by ANOVA with Dunnett's post-test. *denotes significant change from sham (p < 0.05).Discussion Burns are complex injuries that require extensive treatment for the primary insult as well as the secondary global pathologies, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.29 Current evidence from animal models suggests that there is a gut/mesenteric lymph axis that is imbalanced during these injuries caused by increased intestinal epithelial injury resulting in generation of toxic lymph.26,32,43,44 This toxic lymph is the driving force of secondary injury in distal tissues following burns in experimental models and diverting lymph flow so that it does not return to the blood circulation blocking distal injury.26,31,42,43 There is still debate as to what causes lymph from the gut to be toxic after traumatic injury. However, many studies implicate gut tissue-derived cytokines, other immunoactive substances (chemokines, adipokines, TLR agonists etc.), and the immune cells residing in those tissues, but there has not been an extensive characterization of those populations to date.26,30,42,44 Our recent findings that there is a resident mixed population of immune cells in, on, and surrounding lymphatic vessels lead us to examine the numbers of a representative population of those immune cells along the mesenteric lymphatic vessels after burn injury and if it could be regulated pharmacologically (Fig 6).47 FIG. 6. Open in a new tab Overview of the theorized changes that occur around lymphatic vessels during burn injury. As a quiescent state changes to an inflamed state due to burn injury, lymphatic permeability increases allowing lymph contents escape the vessel to form a chemoattractive gradient that guides cells that escape from nearby blood vessels to the lymphatic vessel.Our previous work indicates that the population of MHCII+ immune cells rapidly increases in number along the lymphatic vessel wall following injury. We have previously used this cell population as an indicator of immune cell attraction and accumulation on lymphatic vessels in a number of different pathologies, including ageing, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. This subtype of immune cell is highly MHCII+, CD74+, and in the rat is CD11c−, CD206± (proportions can change depending upon tissue state), CD86±, CD83±, CD68+, and CCR6± (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/lrb). This suggests that we are looking at a relatively diverse set of populations capable of antigen presentation or a spectrum of a single population of antigen-presenting cells. Given that these cells are highly MHCII+, we assume that they are professional antigen-presenting cells that are unique in that they traffic to the lymphatic vessel wall as opposed to entering the initial lymphatics and then moving to the lymph node. Our study demonstrates that these cells can take up and process antigen carried in the lymph stream (Supplementary Fig. S2). This suggests that they may be able to present antigen and activate immune responses in the peripheral tissues. However, these studies have not demonstrated which cell type these lymphatic vessel wall-trafficking antigen-presenting cells interact with. In this pathology, these MHCII+ cells could likely be presenting antigen and activation signals to cells such as tissue-resident T cells (such as TH-17 and γδ T-cells) that have been shown to play a major role in the pathology of burn.53 If this were the case, this would represent a major change in the paradigm of antigen trafficking and immune activation. After burn injury, the number of MHCII+ cells along the lymphatic vessels increased dramatically in a manner similar to but even more profound than what we have observed in our models of intestinal inflammation induced by TNBS. In our previous work, we observed that lymphatic dysfunction correlates to the density of immune cells in close proximity to the outside of lymphatic vessels on a near 1:1 negative ratio.48 Recent findings have shown that lymphatic contractile function (not transport) as measured ex vivo is compromised after burn injury and in the light of this data and our previous studies suggest that this impaired contractile function may be caused by the accumulation of immune cells surrounding the vessels and altering the local environment.40,48 There was also an increase in the number of MHCII+ immune cells in the periphery of the mesenteric tissue that was proportionally greater than the increase along the lymphatic vessels. Thus, we assume that there is some attractive signal carried in lymph that causes cells to home to the external wall of the lymphatic vessels after exiting the blood vasculature during inflammation and injury and that the number of cells leaving the blood vasculature increases at a greater rate than the rate of migration to the lymphatic vessels and possibly leaving the tissue. The exact signal that induces the migration of cells to the lymphatic vessels is currently not known, and we hypothesize that it is carried in the lymph itself. Given our previous data in a model of inflammatory bowel disease, we may presume that it is likely a chemokine signal such as granulocyte/monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) released by activated immune cells in the gut and carried in the lymph.48 However, it cannot be assumed that chemokines such as GM-CSF are the only likely chemoattractants released from the lymph as there are likely many other signals also carried in the lymph stream. We assume that the signal that recruits these cells is carried in the lymph because of evidence from our study. The first piece of evidence is that serum from burn animals induces lymphatic endothelial permeability to increase (Fig. 3) and there is concomitant evidence that there is disruption of the continuity of endothelial cell–cell junctions in the LECs in vitro in response to burn serum (Fig. 4). Disruption of lymphatic endothelial junctional components is not surprising and is similar to findings in blood vascular endothelial cells.54,55 Second, doxycycline (an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases) inhibits the increase in lymphatic endothelial permeability and prevents the disruption of lymphatic endothelial junction stability. Third, doxycycline completely inhibits the accumulation of immune cells on the lymphatic vessels during burn, but only partially blocks the accumulation of cells in the periphery of the mesentery as permeability plays a partial role in the escape of immune cells from the blood vasculature. Fourth, cells already directly in contact with the lymphatic vessels, therefore capable of sampling lymph, change their morphology despite doxycycline treatment. Taken together, this is strong evidence that the chemoattractive force for these cells to migrate to the lymphatic vessels primarily originates in the lymph and not produced by cells that are part of or associated with the vessels, although it cannot be discounted that they may play a small role. The change in the morphology of the perilymphatic MHCII+ cells in burn injury was dramatic, with cells becoming larger, more elongated, and oriented along the vessels, which are signs of macrophage activation.56,57 Activation of these cells along the vessels may result in the further generation and addition to the lymph of inflammatory mediators that are problematic in the treatment of burn. In our previous studies, we found that the genes for the inflammatory mediators, tumor necrosis factor-α and inducible nitrous oxide synthase, were upregulated along the vessels due to migration of the immune cells to the perilymphatic space. Due to the proximity of the cells to the lymphatic vessels it is highly likely that the cellular products of these cells are carried immediately into the lymph stream with little dilution by other cellular products (such as lymph generated at initial lymphatics). The morphology of the cells on the mesenteric lymphatic vessels following doxycycline treatment during burn also changes, but in different ways that in burn alone. The cells present after doxycycline-treated burn increase in size to a greater degree than that of the burn alone group, while the aspect ratio decreased to levels below control. These size changes suggest that, despite the reduced number of cells being attracted to the vessels, the immune cells that are present are being activated. Thus, these cells are likely sampling lymph “normally,” like we have observed in our antigen-trafficking studies (Supplementary Fig. S2). The decreased aspect ratio of the cells is difficult to interpret, given that an increased score would suggest a closer association with the vessel axis, while a reduced score suggests a nonspecific enlargement. The reduced score we found in doxycycline-treated burn cells may be evidence that these local lymphatic-associated immune cells can be activated in response to an aberrant signal in lymph, but need a secondary signal which may come from outside the vessel to increase their association with the vessel. This signal could originate from another immune cell population that would normally arrive after injury. It is widely accepted that toxic lymph develops in models of trauma and induces dysfunction in a number of organs and cell types. We have found that during burn injury there is increased potential for lymphatic leakage and this leakage is associated with increased recruitment of MHCII+ cells along the mesenteric lymphatic vessels, and these cells alter their morphology suggesting inflammatory activation. We know from our previous work that cells much like these express high levels of inflammatory mediators and given their proximity to the lymphatic vessels, these cells likely influence the makeup of the lymph and the function of the lymphatic vessels during injury. This influence may be a factor in the development of toxic lymph after trauma that has not been studied.Supplementary Material Supplemental data Supp_Fig1.pdf (205.3KB, pdf) Supplemental data Supp_Fig2.pdf (94.9KB, pdf) Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the Cardiovascular Research Institute at Texas A&M Health Science Center, The Lymphatic Biology Division at Texas A&M Health Science Center, and Center for Cell Death and Differentiation at Baylor Scott and White, as well as the NSBRI FIRST fellowship program (NCC 9-58).Source of Funding  DK099221, HL096552, R01 HL094269, CA136466, The Scott and White Research Foundation, The Texas A&M Health Science Center, The Center for Cell Death and Differentiation, and by the National Space Biomedical Research Institute through NASA NCC 9-58Author Disclosure Statement No competing financial interests exist.References 1.Huxley VH, Scallan J.

    "introduction": "Introduction More than two decades of experiments on the ISS have had, and continue to have, a strong impact on research, science, and society as a whole1–3. The growing number of astrobiology and astrochemistry experiments onboard the ISS provides new insights and knowledge, which, via new products, techniques, and technology, have a long-lasting effect on our daily lives and culture4. Astrobiology and astrochemistry address some of the most exciting questions to be asked by humankind, including the origins of life on Earth, life elsewhere in the universe or the exploration and colonization of other planets. A major topic in astrobiology and astrochemistry is radiation and the influence of the space environment or planetary conditions on biological systems and molecules. While laboratory facilities can simulate some individual parameters, it is not currently possible to faithfully replicate the space environment on the ground. In this respect, the ISS provides an excellent platform to perform irradiation experiments beyond the protective atmosphere of the Earth. Beyond the ISS, the design and implementation of new platforms (such as small satellite platforms, CubeSats5–9 or the Lunar Orbital Gateway10) offer new possibilities for experiments in space. The latter will rely heavily on machine learning and other advances in artificial intelligence, in particular for navigation11,12 and on-the-fly repair of hardware13, a trend that will surely continue in the future. In 2020, the astrobiology and astrochemistry science community in Europe was tasked by ESA to provide an up-to-date scientific roadmap for the utilization of current and future space platforms (ESA SciSpacE Science Community White Papers: esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/HRE/SciSpacE_Roadmaps.pdf). This work was supported by ESA and builds upon work by previous ESA topical teams and experts in the field who extensively reviewed the scientific literature and the possibilities to advance our knowledge and understanding in astrobiology and astrochemistry research3,14,15. In addition to ground-based research, platforms, and concepts for experiments in space have been explored and discussed. To best utilize such space platforms, a number of top science objectives and related sub-objectives were identified. The interdisciplinary nature of this field prevents prioritization among these closely interwoven topics. Figure 1 shows the main themes and key areas that have been recognized and agreed upon. They consist of (A) Understanding the origins of life, (B) Understanding habitability and the limits of life, and (C) Understanding the signs of life. Each key topic and its sub-topics are described in more detail in the following sections: Fig. 1. Key astrobiology and astrochemistry topics. Open in a new tab As identified in the 2021 ESA SciSpacE Science Community White Paper (esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/HRE/10_Biology_Astrobiology.pdf), key astrobiology and astrochemistry topics are A understanding the origins of life, B understanding the habitability of life and C understanding the signs of life. The origins of life—topic A Life on Earth is currently our only accessible and scientific comprehensive reference for astrobiology studies. How life originated on Earth is a central question to inform and guide our search for life beyond our planet. While the Earth’s environment, with stable liquid water at the surface, is unique in the Solar System today, this was not always the case. When life emerged on Earth (maybe more than 4 billion years ago), the environment was more similar to that of the other early rocky planets in the Solar System, such as Mars or perhaps Venus. Similarly, subsurface liquid water is present on icy moons such as Europa or Enceladus. As these environments resemble subglacial Antarctic lakes found on Earth (which are known to harbor a diverse assemblage of microorganisms16), icy moons are highly interesting candidates in the search for life. Despite these similarities, beyond our solar system and among the expanding number of known exoplanets, an analog of either the early Earth or the Earth today has yet to be found. It is crucial to understand the composition and role of the primitive atmosphere and the lithosphere (e.g., organic synthesis in hydrothermal vents), as well as the role of solar radiation, taking into account a different atmospheric composition than today’s and a faint young sun. These are all critical factors to be addressed in assessing both the specific and general roles of the Earth’s environment. It is now commonly accepted that a significant part of the organic material in early Earth’s environment was provided via meteorites and micrometeorites, originating from carbonaceous asteroids and comets17–19. It is therefore important to understand the origin and formation of such material and how the journey through space influences organic material before it was delivered to Earth. With this in mind, various questions arise regarding the role of exogenous organic material delivery by small cosmic bodies, including but not limited to: where and how was the organic matter formed and how was it incorporated into small bodies or planetesimals; how radiation affects the formation of organic compounds; how much of this material was delivered to Earth; how might the mineral matrix of the small bodies change during space travel; how the physicochemical properties of inorganic and mineral surfaces may have affected the formation, nature, preservation, amount and local distribution of organic material; do these factors play a protective role against space radiation or atmospheric entry; and what is the significance of exogenously delivered organic material versus endogenous organics in the prebiotic chemistry leading to the origins of life20? A key point in studying the origin of life is to understand abiogenesis; the transition from purely chemical, to a molecular prebiotic phase, and finally to a living and replicative system. Defining life as an auto-replicative system that evolves by natural selection, we can state that chemistry naturally spawns biology. Major improvements have been achieved in this field in the past few years21. Organic chemistry and chemical evolution are clearly central to this integrated understanding. Habitability and the limits of life—topic B Study of life on Earth has shown the astounding ability of living systems to adapt to the most extreme and improbable environments on Earth (withstanding extremes in temperature, pressure, pH, humidity, salinity, radiation dose, and oxidation)22,23. In fact, the majority of terrestrial environments are inhabited by multiple domains of life. The emergence of life on Earth under environmental conditions very different to those reigning today, and the tremendous capacity of life to adapt to and even prosper under conditions that we would consider “extreme”, provide perspective for the search for life elsewhere in the Solar System, and broaden the scope of what the term “habitable” can mean. Many inhabited extreme environments on Earth combine several parameters that are considered (from a human perspective) to be extreme in themselves. The resistance of a given organism to environmental extremes (either naturally occurring or artificial), and how these potential stress-inducing parameters influence its overall response, is an important avenue of research. Some studies of the effects of individual and combined extreme environments can be performed at appropriate field sites on Earth or using simulated environmental parameters in the laboratory24. However, to truly examine the combination of effects induced by the complex space environment, space experiments are a necessity. As such, ground and space-based approaches should be seen as complementary to maximize scientific return. Our improved understanding of characteristics, mechanisms of adaptation, and resistance of astrobiologically relevant and extremophilic organisms to space conditions is critical in understanding the biological effects of the space environment. Such studies are needed to define habitability (for life as we know it) and to support space exploration and the search for life beyond our planet. This includes continued protection of humans in space, as well as protecting the Earth, other planets and moons as human space exploration progresses. Despite the broad range of physically and chemically extreme environments naturally present on Earth, some extraterrestrial conditions are specific to space, planetary, or planetary satellite environments. These conditions include low pressure down to space vacuum, exceptionally low relative humidity, micro- and fractional gravities, or parameters that may mimic the early Earth environment (anoxic, high radiation, warmer temperatures). Moreover, the Earth’s present magnetic field and atmosphere attenuate the far higher doses of ionizing and short-wavelength solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation that exist in space or on the surfaces of some other solar system bodies. It is possible to mimic single components of space radiation on Earth, but, due to its complexity, the radiation field in space can only partly be simulated25,26. Access to space environments is necessary in order to perform in situ exposure of organisms and their component macromolecules (nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, etc.). This allows for the measurement of space-radiation-induced metabolic, genetic, and phenotypic changes, as well as the survival of, or damage to, key biomolecules. When investigating the constraints of life beyond Earth, such space-based experiments are critical in identifying individual or combined physically extreme parameters, that cannot be found or simulated on Earth. Terrestrial organisms typically form groups and communities that provide advantages for survival and adaptation to environmental conditions. Single organisms may not be able to cope with extreme environmental parameters; however, biological interactions may provide collective protection, thus protecting many individuals. Adaptation to large environmental changes on a planetary scale (such as those that occurred on Mars27) may be mitigated on the micro-scale in environmental niches by associations of organisms of either the same or different species (dual/multi-species biofilms, symbionts, ecosystems23,28,29), and their interactions with abiotic material (rock/regolith layers, etc.). Investigating survival and adaptation strategies based on community formation and symbiotic relationships is important to understanding the limits of habitability. As there is an increasing number of organisms being discovered and described that show adaptations to extreme environments30,31, it is essential to determine if these novel extremophiles imply that life could be distributed (either naturally or artificially) through the Solar System. There is a possibility that organisms could travel to and survive within interplanetary meteorites (e.g., those ejected from Mars to Earth); the mineral protection and preservation of organisms or biomolecules under these relevant environments is important. In addition to the natural distribution of life in the Solar System, we must assume that space exploration could result in forward contamination of solar system bodies by terrestrial material. This further underlines the need for Earth orbit and space-based in situ experiments, focusing on the survival strategies of organisms and their means of adaptation to environmental parameters not found on Earth. Knowledge of these survival strategies and the limits of extremophilic organisms will lead to further developments and improvements of decontamination procedures in a context of planetary protection. Currently, such decontamination procedures are the only way to minimize the risk of contamination of other worlds with terrestrial life. This is of particular importance for destinations that are considered habitable and may have (developed) their own biota. The investigation of viable spacecraft microbiota (both external and internal) will support more targeted, destination-dependent planetary protection measures. The potential impact and likelihood of forward biocontamination by both robotic and human missions must be considered very carefully, both at the technical and operational level, particularly assessing their compatibility with life-detection missions. The signs of life—topic C To understand the signs of life (biosignatures) in and beyond our solar system, we must focus on cells, their remnants, clearly cell-related biochemical molecules, as well as biomediated structures. In addition, studying environmental transformations (including potential bio-driven transformations of atmospheric composition) should be an important objective. This topic focuses on detecting signs of life using a suite of complementary instruments, on the characterization of distinct cellular components and the stability of these biomolecules, as well as any specific physical evidence of interaction of cells with their environment. This is particularly relevant for in situ missions searching for evidence of life, as well as for analysis of returned extraterrestrial samples. The search for signs of extinct life (either biomineralized or fossilized) relies on detecting organic, geochemical, isotopic or morphological remnants or other biomediated phenomena, such as biolaminae or stromatolitic bioconstructions32, at, or within planetary subsurfaces or ices. A better understanding of the process of fossilization and how extant biosignatures are preserved over geological time is required33. A relevant example of this is the search for past life on Mars. UV radiation interactions with organic remnants under different atmospheres, temperatures, pressures, and humidities needs to be investigated using references, such as terrestrial fossils from Earth. This can be performed under simulated conditions (planetary-simulation facilities34), however space-exposure facilities provide access to environmental parameters not available on Earth, such as microgravity, full-spectrum solar and cosmic radiation. Such experiments can provide insights into early-Earth conditions similar to those expected on rocky planets (such as Mars or Venus) or exoplanets. Looking beyond our solar system, the simulation of potential exoplanetary conditions is crucial to decoding spectral signatures and therefore to understanding and interpreting their formation and evolution. Space-based experiments are of particular importance when assessing the impact of the solar spectrum and cosmic rays on biological compounds and organisms as fully representative photon and particle spectra cannot be reproduced in the laboratory. As molecules produced by life forms might not be unambiguously identified, this is a particular challenge for remote detection in (exo)planetary atmospheres or surfaces. Therefore, it is paramount to understand transformational processes and biochemical pathways of biosignatures, especially those that can be detected as volatile organic compounds or gaseous biosignatures in a planetary atmosphere. Also, with the various types, ages and sizes of stars, different planets receive different stellar spectra of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, to identify signals of potential pigmented life forms on exoplanets, potential biochemical pathways of ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) absorbing complex organic molecules synthesized in response to spectra different than that of the Sun should be investigated. In the search for extant life, it is important to analyze biomolecules that can serve as cellular constituents. These include amino acids, peptides, lipids, pigments, and carbohydrates. Additional biomolecules of importance are those known from Earth organisms such as sterols, quinones, and porphyrins, as well as polymeric biomolecules that can store and transfer information, e.g., genetic material and proteins. With the assumption that non-Earth life is similar to life as we know it (i.e., based on carbon-bearing molecules with water as a solvent), it is possible to characterize cellular life cycles based on the presence, amount, or change over time of potential biomarker molecules on a planetary surface or atmosphere. In addition to environmental processes influencing biomarker molecules, the converse may also be true, with cellular processes having the potential to influence their surroundings. Such a reciprocal influence must be accounted for when classifying biosignatures or identifying extant life in a space or planetary environment. A systematic approach for the detection of microbial life forms can be based in part upon the collection of data from the known microbial world. Environmental parameters and the geological evolution of potential host planets or planetary bodies should determine their viability as search targets. For instance, life-detection missions to Mars and to the moons Europa and Enceladus will include means to seek signatures of microorganisms similar to terrestrial life forms with metabolisms that could have been present on early Earth (including chemotrophs/anoxygenic photosynthesizers/certain heterotrophs35). Similar evidence-based considerations are needed to tailor missions to other bodies in our solar system. Furthermore, studies are needed to understand the relationship between the signs of life and various environmental conditions present at planetary-analog field sites, during planetary-simulation experiments, as well as in space. Each of these environmental parameters could alter or hide biosignatures, or produce false positives, such a minerals or organomineral structures that imitate the relatively simple morphology of microorganisms. These approaches should not only account for biosignatures derived from “life as we know it” but should also include agnostic biosignatures, i.e., signs of chemical or geological disequilibrium. As such, a variety of detection instruments and analytical techniques should be utilized to systematically add to existing databases such as NASA’s Astrobiology Habitable Environments Database. The integration and synchronization of centralized spaceflight experimental data repositories is a necessity in the future.",

The International Space Station (ISS) is an excellent example of a highly successful and long-lasting research platform for experiments in space, that has provided a wealth of scientific data over the last two decades. However, future space platforms present new opportunities to conduct experiments with the potential to address key topics in astrobiology and astrochemistry. In this perspective, the European Space Agency (ESA) Topical Team Astrobiology and Astrochemistry (with feedback from the wider scientific community) identifies a number of key topics and summarizes the 2021 “ESA SciSpacE Science Community White Paper” for astrobiology and astrochemistry. We highlight recommendations for the development and implementation of future experiments, discuss types of in situ measurements, experimental parameters, exposure scenarios and orbits, and identify knowledge gaps and how to advance scientific utilization of future space-exposure platforms that are either currently under development or in an advanced planning stage. In addition to the ISS, these platforms include CubeSats and SmallSats, as well as larger platforms such as the Lunar Orbital Gateway. We also provide an outlook for in situ experiments on the Moon and Mars, and welcome new possibilities to support the search for exoplanets and potential biosignatures within and beyond our solar system.

The growing number of astrobiology and astrochemistry experiments onboard the ISS provides new insights and knowledge, which, via new products, techniques, and technology, have a long-lasting effect on our daily lives and culture4. Astrobiology and astrochemistry address some of the most exciting questions to be asked by humankind, including the origins of life on Earth, life elsewhere in the universe or the exploration and colonization of other planets. A major topic in astrobiology and astrochemistry is radiation and the influence of the space environment or planetary conditions on biological systems and molecules. While laboratory facilities can simulate some individual parameters, it is not currently possible to faithfully replicate the space environment on the ground. In this respect, the ISS provides an excellent platform to perform irradiation experiments beyond the protective atmosphere of the Earth.

How life originated on Earth is a central question to inform and guide our search for life beyond our planet. While the Earth’s environment, with stable liquid water at the surface, is unique in the Solar System today, this was not always the case. When life emerged on Earth (maybe more than 4 billion years ago), the environment was more similar to that of the other early rocky planets in the Solar System, such as Mars or perhaps Venus. Similarly, subsurface liquid water is present on icy moons such as Europa or Enceladus. As these environments resemble subglacial Antarctic lakes found on Earth (which are known to harbor a diverse assemblage of microorganisms16), icy moons are highly interesting candidates in the search for life. Despite these similarities, beyond our solar system and among the expanding number of known exoplanets, an analog of either the early Earth or the Earth today has yet to be found. It is crucial to understand the composition and role of the primitive atmosphere and the lithosphere (e.g., organic synthesis in hydrothermal vents), as well as the role of solar radiation, taking into account a different atmospheric composition than today’s and a faint young sun. These are all critical factors to be addressed in assessing both the specific and general roles of the Earth’s environment. It is now commonly accepted that a significant part of the organic material in early Earth’s environment was provided via meteorites and micrometeorites, originating from carbonaceous asteroids and comets17–19. It is therefore important to understand the origin and formation of such material and how the journey through space influences organic material before it was delivered to Earth. With this in mind, various questions arise regarding the role of exogenous organic material delivery by small cosmic bodies, including but not limited to: where and how was the organic matter formed and how was it incorporated into small bodies or planetesimals; how radiation affects the formation of organic compounds; how much of this material was delivered to Earth; how might the mineral matrix of the small bodies change during space travel; how the physicochemical properties of inorganic and mineral surfaces may have affected the formation, nature, preservation, amount and local distribution of organic material; do these factors play a protective role against space radiation or atmospheric entry; and what is the significance of exogenously delivered organic material versus endogenous organics in the prebiotic chemistry leading to the origins of life20? A key point in studying the origin of life is to understand abiogenesis; the transition from purely chemical, to a molecular prebiotic phase, and finally to a living and replicative system. Defining life as an auto-replicative system that evolves by natural selection, we can state that chemistry naturally spawns biology. Major improvements have been achieved in this field in the past few years21. Organic chemistry and chemical evolution are clearly central to this integrated understanding.Habitability and the limits of life—topic B Study of life on Earth has shown the astounding ability of living systems to adapt to the most extreme and improbable environments on Earth (withstanding extremes in temperature, pressure, pH, humidity, salinity, radiation dose, and oxidation)22,23. In fact, the majority of terrestrial environments are inhabited by multiple domains of life. The emergence of life on Earth under environmental conditions very different to those reigning today, and the tremendous capacity of life to adapt to and even prosper under conditions that we would consider “extreme”, provide perspective for the search for life elsewhere in the Solar System, and broaden the scope of what the term “habitable” can mean. Many inhabited extreme environments on Earth combine several parameters that are considered (from a human perspective) to be extreme in themselves. The resistance of a given organism to environmental extremes (either naturally occurring or artificial), and how these potential stress-inducing parameters influence its overall response, is an important avenue of research. Some studies of the effects of individual and combined extreme environments can be performed at appropriate field sites on Earth or using simulated environmental parameters in the laboratory24. However, to truly examine the combination of effects induced by the complex space environment, space experiments are a necessity. As such, ground and space-based approaches should be seen as complementary to maximize scientific return. Our improved understanding of characteristics, mechanisms of adaptation, and resistance of astrobiologically relevant and extremophilic organisms to space conditions is critical in understanding the biological effects of the space environment. Such studies are needed to define habitability (for life as we know it) and to support space exploration and the search for life beyond our planet. This includes continued protection of humans in space, as well as protecting the Earth, other planets and moons as human space exploration progresses. Despite the broad range of physically and chemically extreme environments naturally present on Earth, some extraterrestrial conditions are specific to space, planetary, or planetary satellite environments. These conditions include low pressure down to space vacuum, exceptionally low relative humidity, micro- and fractional gravities, or parameters that may mimic the early Earth environment (anoxic, high radiation, warmer temperatures). Moreover, the Earth’s present magnetic field and atmosphere attenuate the far higher doses of ionizing and short-wavelength solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation that exist in space or on the surfaces of some other solar system bodies. It is possible to mimic single components of space radiation on Earth, but, due to its complexity, the radiation field in space can only partly be simulated25,26. Access to space environments is necessary in order to perform in situ exposure of organisms and their component macromolecules (nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, etc.). This allows for the measurement of space-radiation-induced metabolic, genetic, and phenotypic changes, as well as the survival of, or damage to, key biomolecules. When investigating the constraints of life beyond Earth, such space-based experiments are critical in identifying individual or combined physically extreme parameters, that cannot be found or simulated on Earth. Terrestrial organisms typically form groups and communities that provide advantages for survival and adaptation to environmental conditions. Single organisms may not be able to cope with extreme environmental parameters; however, biological interactions may provide collective protection, thus protecting many individuals. Adaptation to large environmental changes on a planetary scale (such as those that occurred on Mars27) may be mitigated on the micro-scale in environmental niches by associations of organisms of either the same or different species (dual/multi-species biofilms, symbionts, ecosystems23,28,29), and their interactions with abiotic material (rock/regolith layers, etc.). Investigating survival and adaptation strategies based on community formation and symbiotic relationships is important to understanding the limits of habitability. As there is an increasing number of organisms being discovered and described that show adaptations to extreme environments30,31, it is essential to determine if these novel extremophiles imply that life could be distributed (either naturally or artificially) through the Solar System. There is a possibility that organisms could travel to and survive within interplanetary meteorites (e.g., those ejected from Mars to Earth); the mineral protection and preservation of organisms or biomolecules under these relevant environments is important. In addition to the natural distribution of life in the Solar System, we must assume that space exploration could result in forward contamination of solar system bodies by terrestrial material. This further underlines the need for Earth orbit and space-based in situ experiments, focusing on the survival strategies of organisms and their means of adaptation to environmental parameters not found on Earth. Knowledge of these survival strategies and the limits of extremophilic organisms will lead to further developments and improvements of decontamination procedures in a context of planetary protection. Currently, such decontamination procedures are the only way to minimize the risk of contamination of other worlds with terrestrial life. This is of particular importance for destinations that are considered habitable and may have (developed) their own biota. The investigation of viable spacecraft microbiota (both external and internal) will support more targeted, destination-dependent planetary protection measures. The potential impact and likelihood of forward biocontamination by both robotic and human missions must be considered very carefully, both at the technical and operational level, particularly assessing their compatibility with life-detection missions.The signs of life—topic C To understand the signs of life (biosignatures) in and beyond our solar system, we must focus on cells, their remnants, clearly cell-related biochemical molecules, as well as biomediated structures. In addition, studying environmental transformations (including potential bio-driven transformations of atmospheric composition) should be an important objective. This topic focuses on detecting signs of life using a suite of complementary instruments, on the characterization of distinct cellular components and the stability of these biomolecules, as well as any specific physical evidence of interaction of cells with their environment. This is particularly relevant for in situ missions searching for evidence of life, as well as for analysis of returned extraterrestrial samples. The search for signs of extinct life (either biomineralized or fossilized) relies on detecting organic, geochemical, isotopic or morphological remnants or other biomediated phenomena, such as biolaminae or stromatolitic bioconstructions32, at, or within planetary subsurfaces or ices. A better understanding of the process of fossilization and how extant biosignatures are preserved over geological time is required33. A relevant example of this is the search for past life on Mars. UV radiation interactions with organic remnants under different atmospheres, temperatures, pressures, and humidities needs to be investigated using references, such as terrestrial fossils from Earth. This can be performed under simulated conditions (planetary-simulation facilities34), however space-exposure facilities provide access to environmental parameters not available on Earth, such as microgravity, full-spectrum solar and cosmic radiation. Such experiments can provide insights into early-Earth conditions similar to those expected on rocky planets (such as Mars or Venus) or exoplanets. Looking beyond our solar system, the simulation of potential exoplanetary conditions is crucial to decoding spectral signatures and therefore to understanding and interpreting their formation and evolution. Space-based experiments are of particular importance when assessing the impact of the solar spectrum and cosmic rays on biological compounds and organisms as fully representative photon and particle spectra cannot be reproduced in the laboratory. As molecules produced by life forms might not be unambiguously identified, this is a particular challenge for remote detection in (exo)planetary atmospheres or surfaces. Therefore, it is paramount to understand transformational processes and biochemical pathways of biosignatures, especially those that can be detected as volatile organic compounds or gaseous biosignatures in a planetary atmosphere. Also, with the various types, ages and sizes of stars, different planets receive different stellar spectra of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, to identify signals of potential pigmented life forms on exoplanets, potential biochemical pathways of ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) absorbing complex organic molecules synthesized in response to spectra different than that of the Sun should be investigated. In the search for extant life, it is important to analyze biomolecules that can serve as cellular constituents. These include amino acids, peptides, lipids, pigments, and carbohydrates. Additional biomolecules of importance are those known from Earth organisms such as sterols, quinones, and porphyrins, as well as polymeric biomolecules that can store and transfer information, e.g., genetic material and proteins. With the assumption that non-Earth life is similar to life as we know it (i.e., based on carbon-bearing molecules with water as a solvent), it is possible to characterize cellular life cycles based on the presence, amount, or change over time of potential biomarker molecules on a planetary surface or atmosphere. In addition to environmental processes influencing biomarker molecules, the converse may also be true, with cellular processes having the potential to influence their surroundings. Such a reciprocal influence must be accounted for when classifying biosignatures or identifying extant life in a space or planetary environment. A systematic approach for the detection of microbial life forms can be based in part upon the collection of data from the known microbial world. Environmental parameters and the geological evolution of potential host planets or planetary bodies should determine their viability as search targets. For instance, life-detection missions to Mars and to the moons Europa and Enceladus will include means to seek signatures of microorganisms similar to terrestrial life forms with metabolisms that could have been present on early Earth (including chemotrophs/anoxygenic photosynthesizers/certain heterotrophs35). Similar evidence-based considerations are needed to tailor missions to other bodies in our solar system. Furthermore, studies are needed to understand the relationship between the signs of life and various environmental conditions present at planetary-analog field sites, during planetary-simulation experiments, as well as in space. Each of these environmental parameters could alter or hide biosignatures, or produce false positives, such a minerals or organomineral structures that imitate the relatively simple morphology of microorganisms. These approaches should not only account for biosignatures derived from “life as we know it” but should also include agnostic biosignatures, i.e., signs of chemical or geological disequilibrium. As such, a variety of detection instruments and analytical techniques should be utilized to systematically add to existing databases such as NASA’s Astrobiology Habitable Environments Database. The integration and synchronization of centralized spaceflight experimental data repositories is a necessity in the future.Space platforms for astrobiology and astrochemistry Why space experiments? Space provides a unique environment for performing astrobiology and astrochemistry experiments. Ground-based research is useful for studying the impact of environmental factors on the origin and evolution of life on Earth, and typically provides access to standardized reproducible conditions allowing quick repetitions of experiments, larger samples sizes, higher sample numbers, precise control of physicochemical parameters and an increase in the variety and resolution of analytical techniques at typically lower cost, when compared to space-based experiments. However, ground-based research can currently only be used for assessing single (or a limited sub-set of) space-based environmental factors, and as such provides only limited information on the combined influence of these factors. Experiments performed in space allow the study of effects induced by microgravity, by the wide spectrum of photons and energetically charged particles, as well as their combined effects on samples to be studied. To gather a complete and robust picture of influence of the space environment, a complementary approach must be utilized, exploiting the strengths of both in situ experimentation and ground-based research. Within the context of searching for signs of life, the rationale for missions with the aim of visiting other celestial bodies (e.g., Mars) is mostly self-evident; however, remote-sensing platforms must also be tested and implemented. In addition, space-based experiments that focus on cellular life cycles, adaptation, biomineralization and fossilization processes must often be complemented by diverse ground-based experiments. Commonalities and properties of existing and planned platforms have to be identified to better define the experimental requirements and limitations of specific space platforms, and their suitability for astrobiology and astrochemistry experiments must be assessed. With this assessment, it is possible to decide how best to utilize space experiments to address key astrobiology and astrochemistry topics. Figure 2 illustrates potential locations for a number of space platforms, their distance from Earth and the potential range of mission durations. The distance from Earth and the mission duration give an initial indication of the possibilities of these platforms and are important characteristics for various astrobiology and astrochemistry experiments. For example, distance and duration are correlated with the type and amount of radiation that targets would receive. Fig. 2. Space platforms for astrobiology and astrochemistry research. Open in a new tab Space exposure experiments require suitable platforms for providing levels of radiation and microgravity. Platform location dictates mission duration, radiation exposure, the potential for sample return and the necessity of in situ measurements. As the distance from Earth increases, different radiation environments become available at the cost of increasingly challenging sample return.Why experiments in specific orbits/locations? Space-based experiments in certain low Earth orbits (LEOs), or on the Moon and Mars, allow access to higher fluxes of high-energy photons, galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles compared to the terrestrial environment. Specific locations, however, can have vastly different radiation levels. For example, the Moon receives a very high radiation dose whereas the level on Mars is lower due to its thin atmosphere. To constrain radiation-driven processes and examine their effects on biology, simultaneous ground-based and space experiments are needed. An advantage of space experiments, especially in the field of astrochemistry, is that platforms can be designed and operated far from sources of terrestrial or artificial contamination (e.g., atmospheric pollution, outgassing events from larger platforms, vibrations and electromagnetic interferences). Similarly, remote-sensing methods that use telescope optics to collect spectral data in the near-infrared (IR) to radio wavelength ranges, as well as visible and UV, function most optimally beyond the Earth’s atmosphere. Within the context of finding signs of life in our own solar system, it is clear that sending probes to planets and moons of interest is the most efficient way to search for signatures of extant or extinct life. The nature of these missions is highly dependent on the environment of the world under investigation. For example, in the case of Europa, current projects are solely orbital, relying on remote-sensing techniques as well as encountering ejecta from the surface of the moon itself36,37, even though mission proposals for in situ investigations are discussed. On the other hand, previous, current and future missions to Mars and Titan include significant landing modules to study the surface directly38,39. A special case, Saturn’s moon Enceladus ejects ice particles from its subsurface ocean into space via south polar “cryovolcanoes”, providing fly-by missions the opportunity to examine recently frozen water for life’s signatures40.How long would the mission duration need to be? In order for large-scale space-based facilities (e.g., the ISS, the James Webb Space Telescope, or the planned PLATO spacecraft41) to make fiscal sense, their lifetimes must be typically on the order of decades. However, the advent of SmallSats and CubeSats (e.g., O/OREOS42, SpectroCube7, IR-COASTER5, BioSentinel8,9) are currently challenging this assumption. Short-term exposure experiments (e.g., BIOPAN43) should be used as predecessors or viability assessments for long-term exposure experiments, and small-scale missions (e.g., Twinkle44, CUTE45) should be used to support multi-decade lifespan spacecraft. This implies that miniaturization of existing technology is of the utmost importance. The study of photochemical processes and reaction pathways typically requires several months of radiation exposure in, for example, LEO to accrue a total radiation dose that produce measurable effects, leading to overall mission times on the order of one year. Similarly, radiation-biological effects on some extremophilic microorganisms require months of exposure to accumulate. However, this must be assessed based on the tolerances of the organism under investigation, as well as the specific location of the experimental platform. Finally, to assess the long-term, cumulative effects and adaptations to space radiation, radiotolerant and extremophilic organisms (and organisms with resistant forms, e.g., spores) should be exposed for long durations. The importance of time taken to reach a destination becomes even more important for missions further afield, such as to Mars or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. In these cases, there is a minimum mission duration ranging from months to a decade or more with current propulsion technologies.What mode of operation is required? In the past, space-exposure platforms have relied on sample-return experiments (e.g., the Long-Duration Exposure Facility46, EURECA, EXPOSE-E, EXPOSE-R, EXPOSE-R247–50), and while such methods provided access to the LEO environment, the lack of time-resolved data was a major limit to the conclusions that could be drawn. The collection of data during space missions is highly desirable for future space experiments. Such in situ analyses are an important way of adding redundancy and reducing the risks of space missions, while at the same time providing a more detailed, comprehensive data set compared to experiments relying solely on pre/post-flight analysis. When designing future space facilities, organic compounds of prebiotic interest, cellular and molecular biosignatures, as well as both the fossilized remains and live microorganisms should be studied under plausible space and planetary conditions, with variable but known and controlled radiation, pressure, and temperature parameters51. To investigate a wide range of environmental parameters, space-based experimental facilities should implement dynamic humidity levels, wet/dry cycling and freeze/thaw cycles with the possibility of real-time analyses to follow any changes encountered. New facilities should allow for in situ thermal control and the possibility to simulate cool planets (e.g., N2 cooling cycles), icy moons, comets, and interstellar-medium conditions (e.g., He cooling). For experiments involving living organisms, multiple generations of live, metabolically active organisms should be exposed via small payloads that implement fine temperature control, relative humidity, pressure, pH, atmospheric composition, nutrient/reagent supply, and the removal of waste products (liquids and gases). Bioreactors and microevolution chambers require further development and optimization, for instance microfluidic systems can implement fine control of a variety of environmental parameters. Microwells, each with independent fluidic inlets and outlets, can be utilized for a large number of low-volume microbial growth experiments, operated in parallel52. Experiments with living systems (such as NASA’s BRIC53, BioCell Habitat54) require automatic assay, often including subsampling at regular intervals, in situ telemonitoring (observing the appropriate functions, e.g., metabolism, genetic transcription and translation, self-repair mechanisms and quantification of adaptions), and the capacity for adjustments to be made via telecommand. Although in situ analysis is currently the most effective means to acquire data from interplanetary probes, sample return or (ex situ) lab analogs are highly informative and complementary to such in situ analyses. To learn the most from in situ biological experiments conducted in space or planetary environments, following exposure, it is highly desirable to preserve and return samples to Earth for in-depth, laboratory-based studies. Of particular interest is the genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic & metabolomic influence of the space environment. This will require standardization of experimental protocols for selected, well-studied model organisms of interest, allowing gathered in space to be compared between experiments data. In general, analytical techniques should have a dual function: on the one hand, to give extensive information on the processes at work, and on the other hand, to allow comparison with astronomical data and data from space missions38,55. In addition to experiments focusing on the exposure of samples to the space environment, methods must be designed to process and handle samples returned from space missions, with particular emphasis on planetary protection and life detection. In this regard, space platforms with frequent access (e.g., ISS) are ideal to test sample-return scenarios for interplanetary missions (e.g., Mars).Which (in situ) analyses are foreseen? While several biological methods and technologies have recently been adapted to space conditions with operation by human crew (e.g., DNA extractions56, the FLUMIAS live cell imaging microscope57, and RT-PCR instruments58), to fully understand the scope and details of the impacts of extended durations in the space environment upon terrestrial organisms, it is imperative to continue advancing space-compatible cellular analytical techniques, such as qPCR58, high-throughput sequencing, fluorescence-activated cell sorting59 or sub-cellular microscopic techniques. In addition to studies of monocultures of extremophilic microbes, biological interactions, such as biofilms, symbionts or microbial communities may result in increased resistance to the environmental stressors of space. As such, focus should be placed on understanding how a given biological interaction influences survivability and adaptation, along with the identification of keystone species that are particularly influential. For a detailed analysis of such community samples, both in situ and postexposure analyses (with instrumentation not available for in-flight measurements) are typically required. In order for landed missions, such as the Mars surface rovers (mars.nasa.gov/msl/, mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/) to aqcuire evidence that could point to (extant or extinct) extraterrestrial life and to more generally understand the organic chemical history of other bodies in our solar system, they require sophisiticated in situ measurement and data analysis capabilities. Samples such as rock cores can be examined in both a geological context and in the search for organic molecules, having the potential to provide information on the decay of biomarker molecules or life cycle processes. To obtain such information, landers and rovers use a range of observational techniques (surface imaging via radar, cameras and microscopes) in combination with various in situ spectroscopic and spectrometric methods. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a cornerstone in situ analytical technique for landers60 and is currently the only way to detect enantiomeric excess of chiral molecules in situ61. Prominent examples of its use on Mars include the Viking missions of the mid 1970s62 and the Mars Science Lander63 that continues to operate on the Martian surface. Sample mapping and composition analysis is commonly performed using a variety of spectroscopic techniques, including UV–vis absorption and UV–vis fluorescence measurements, transmission and reflection Fourier-transform IR microscopy, Raman, Mössbauer, X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy7,42,64–66. Other useful techniques for analyzing both organic and inorganic species, currently being miniaturized for in situ use include laser ablation and laser ablation ionization mass spectrometry67,68. The current technologies outlined above are being utilized for specific selection of candidate samples, which can later be returned to Earth for more detailed study (e.g., the current Mars Sample Return campaign69). However, looking to the future, more advanced in situ techniques could be miniaturized and implemented, potentially alleviating the need for sample return and thus reducing overall mission complexity and cost. For example, in situ MS is a very relevant analytical technique, recently used by the Mars Science Laboratory70 to analyze gases and sublimated species released by thermal means. However, heating a sample to high temperatures may release volatile organic species that can trigger chemical reactions or the degradation of potential biomarkers. As such, new technologies are being developed to extract soluble organics from solid (irradiated) samples at mild temperatures using solvent-based techniques, without degradation71; following such extraction, various high-resolution MS and tandem-MS techniques can be employed to understand the nature and provenance of the organic signatures by measuring structural information as well as the extent of the “decay” (alteration over time) of molecular structures.Which platform would be best suited? The launch and maintenance of large-scale space platforms (such as space-based telescopes or manned platforms) require huge, dedicated, often multinational, space agency missions. The ISS remains an important exposure platform for both short- and long-term experiments, with the possibility for sample return. Furthermore, the ISS can be utilized as a test platform for future developments and the technological heritage from the ISS can be re-utilized on other platforms. The Lunar Gateway is progressing toward hosting such experiments in the Moon’s vicinity in a matter of years; nonetheless, nanosatellites, CubeSats, and SmallSats are becoming increasingly robust and readily available. They have proved capable of providing complementary information and thus are opening the field of study in this regard (e.g., Pandora72). SmallSats allow for studies ranging from the time-dependent alteration of molecules exposed to particle and electromagnetic radiation, to mimicking conditions on small bodies, to studies of the impact of the space environment on organics in meteorites, and they are showing that astrochemistry exposure experiments can be done outside of traditional platforms such as the ISS. These platforms are potentially also well suited for space biology experiments that expose living organisms over multiple generations to microgravity in combination with levels and distributions of energetic particle radiation only available beyond LEO. To execute such studies effectively the experimental durations aboard these small platforms need to be extended to (many) months to accumulate total radiation dosage with measurable biological effects. As mentioned previously, the continued development of highly sensitive and sophisticated autonomous bioanalytical systems with potential to measure genetic parameters, -omics, and other key biological properties is required. Nevertheless, life-detection experiments requiring surface landers continue to require costly, dedicated missions. For a lander to make an unambiguous set of measurements that either support or refute a finding of the presence of life on another world, multiple complementary and synergistic analytical methods will most likely be required. As such, larger-scale platforms (relative to CubeSats and SmallSats) are required in this scenario, first to allow for landing, and second to house the required suite of sophisticated analytical tools that are typically too bulky for small platforms. A drawback of SmallSats is the lack of sample-return capabilities in most cases, which is necessary to investigate a variety of cellular effects on ground with a suite of sophisticated instruments not (yet) available in and beyond LEO. Living metabolically active organisms, cellular processes or community composition may be directly influenced by non-Earth gravity (either micro- or hypergravity). Direct, in situ investigations (using exposure platforms) will solve many issues associated with simulated gravity experiments73. Similar experiments with high fluxes of galactic cosmic rays and solar particles are required, especially in preparation for human exploration. A main focus of space platforms is the combined influence of microgravity and varying space-radiation conditions. These can be compared against laboratory facilities (clinostat, simulated solar radiation, gamma radiation sources, heavy ion accelerators, electron beam facilities, X-ray sources, etc). Additionally, new space facilities (such as the Lunar Orbital Gateway) will provide a novel environment in which the establishment of a new microbiome can be studied. While a similar capability for a more limited class of experiments is in principle also feasible with SmallSats or CubeSats, the Lunar Orbital Gateway will be distinct, given the limited human presence and potential for long-term monitoring. A “clean” and isolated environment such as this is unique, and thus monitoring of the microbiome over time could provide valuable insights and important information for future habitats on the Moon or Mars. In addition to focusing on changes induced by the space environment, experiments to determine the transformative effects from the process of re-entry have also been performed6,74,75. Samples such as Martian sedimentary rocks containing organic material have been placed in the heat shield of craft returning from LEO, subjecting them to extreme temperatures and a high-velocity plasma environment that is incredibly challenging to replicate ex situ. The survivability of organisms and/or the degradation of biomolecules should be assessed under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions of atmospheric re-entry and surface impact. Such experiments should be conducted on platforms (e.g., STONE76,77), re-entry nanosatellites, or as external additions on larger returning spacecraft. The potentially protective influence of rocky body-associated minerals must also be accounted for. With regard to both forward (contamination from Earth carried to other bodies) and reverse (extraterrestrial organisms brought back to Earth) planetary protection, both internal and external biocontamination must be assessed at the molecular level; a process that is also mandatory for search-for-life missions in order to eliminate serious risk of false positives.Recommended space-exposure payloads: short and medium term The key questions in each of the topics presented in the introduction of this perspective can be addressed by specific space experiments on either multi-experiment space-exposure facilities or by means of tailored space platforms. Short (next 3 years) and medium (next 5 years) term recommendations for experiments in the key area A, “understanding the origins of life” include the design and implementation of experiments with active analytical capabilities (e.g., in situ spectroscopy and mass spectrometry) and active environmental control. In particular, platforms capable of maintaining sample temperatures well below 0 °C, ideally even at temperatures as low as <100 K, are required for a next generation of astrochemistry experiments and investigations of ice-organics mixtures, icy-moon, and interstellar-medium conditions. A further recommendation is to perform such experiments in locations with minimal terrestrial pollution, for example avoiding outgassing events from larger facilities such as the ISS. In addition to exposure experiments, platforms designed for re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere are recommended to advance our understanding of meteoritic impact processes. Such platforms should be capable of carrying and analyzing samples either in situ or after hardware retrieval. In key area B, “understanding habitability and the limits of life”, recommended experiments and platforms should focus on the impact of the space environment on living (micro)organisms, in particular, the combination of radiation and microgravity. Paired with in situ analytical capabilities, these experiments should study the response and adaptation of living systems to multiple stresses that can be monitored directly in space. This will likely require microfluidic and liquid-handling systems that function reliably in space. In addition to in situ data, sample return for in-detail analysis after the space-exposure phase is highly desirable. Re-entry platforms are recommended for the study of impact scenarios and how they affect either actively-growing or dormant living organisms. With the focus of key area C, “understanding the signs of life”, being on detectability and identification of potential biosignatures, experiments in this area must be capable of simulating space and planetary conditions, including the respective radiation environment (electromagnetic and particle radiation). This can be achieved by designing and implementing space-exposure platforms that can access specific radiation environments, e.g., low- or highly elliptical orbits around Earth, the moon or interplanetary platforms. In situ analysis will be a key tool for such experiments investigating the stability or alteration of specific biosignatures (in the solid or gas phase) under conditions mimicking space and (exo)planetary conditions.Future outlook and summary We live in exciting times for space sciences and space exploration with an unprecedented number of missions in the implementation or planning phases. Driven by commercialization and reduced launch and development costs, the progress in space technology, miniaturization and automation offers new possibilities for experiments in space environments and enables the design and implementation of new space-exposure platforms. With the advent of artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics, performing more complex scientific experiments beyond Earth is becoming increasingly feasible and enables addressing important questions in the fields of astrobiology and astrochemistry, highlighted in the introduction to this perspective. Astrobiology experiments with live cells require sophisticated fluidic systems and in situ analytics and are key to advancing our understanding of the limits of life on and beyond Earth (topic A). The space environment, for the exposure of samples to early Earth or other simulated planetary conditions, is an excellent tool for addressing questions in relation to the origin and evolution of life, including prebiotic chemistry (topic B). Astrochemistry aims to investigate processes and conditions not necessarily found on Earth and difficult to simulate in terrestrial laboratories. While ground experiments can provide a cost-effective means to acquire preliminary data in preparation for space experiments, having access to space environments via the space platforms discussed is critical to perform astrochemistry experiments in their native environments thus allowing the simulation of important astrophysical, astrochemical and planetary conditions more faithfully than Earth-based facilities. This will be crucial for understanding the formation of organic molecules as well as potential biosignatures, and in support of current and upcoming life-detection missions to planetary and lunar bodies in our solar system (topic C). Beyond the solar system, and in the rapidly expanding field of exoplanetary sciences, new space platforms and telescopes play a pivotal role in understanding planetary habitability and possibly detecting signs of life, which has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of life in the universe.

    "title": "In situ resource utilisation: The potential for space biomining",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8739323/",
    "abstract": "Abstract As we aim to expand human presence in space, we need to find viable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources. Space biomining of the Moon, Mars and asteroids has been indicated as one of the promising approaches to achieve in-situ resource utilization by the main space agencies. Structural and expensive metals, essential mineral nutrients, water, oxygen and volatiles could be potentially extracted from extraterrestrial regolith and rocks using microbial-based biotechnologies. The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to space bioremediation, recycling of waste and to reinforce regenerative life support systems. However, the science around space biomining is still young. Relevant differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions exist, including the rock types and ores available for mining, and a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be a possibility. It is, therefore, necessary to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications to learn the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expand our knowledge on organotrophic and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, as well as on anaerobic biomining, and investigate the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations posed by the space environments.

    "introduction": "Introduction As the goal for human space exploration moves farther from Earth, relying on a constant resupply of resources from Earth becomes less viable. In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) approaches have the aim of enabling sustainable exploration and settlement of space, by mitigating the need of importing goods and materials from Earth (NASA-ASEE 1992; Anand et al. 2012; Montague et al. 2012; Menezes et al. 2015b; Verseux et al. 2016). Microbial-based biotechnologies and biomanufacturing approaches have demonstrated their high efficacy in several applications and may become a key component of future ISRU strategies (Brown et al. 2008; Slenzka and Kempf 2010; Montague et al. 2012; Verseux et al. 2016; Nangle et al. 2020; Volponi and Lasseur 2020; Berliner et al. 2021; Castelein et al. 2021; Keller et al. 2021). Minerals and metals will be necessary resources for construction, infrastructure and manufacturing. Water, oxygen, volatiles, essential nutrients for human nutrition and soil fertilization, are all elements which will be essential to establish self-sufficient settlements, and that could be obtained from extraterrestrial rocks (Cockell 2011). Mining of these resources will therefore be a priority for an extraterrestrial settlement. Microorganisms can be applied to these needs, extracting useful elements by a technique called biomining or bioleaching. Currently on Earth around 20–25% of copper and 5% of gold are extracted using biomining (Johnson et al. 2013). Bioleaching can provide economic and environmental advantages compared to other methods (Srichandan et al. 2019) and can be used as a complementary technique to extract trace metals from mine waste, or recover low-grade ores which cannot be treated by conventional methods (Bosecker 1997). Mining processes produce an enormous amount of waste low-grade rock material and mill tailings, which often still contain useful trace elements that cannot be further recovered by traditional methods. However, these can be accessible to small microbial cells, as an effect of specific types of metabolism (Blowes et al. 2003; Schippers et al. 2013; Johnson 2014; Jerez 2017a). With the same principle, bioleaching techniques can be applied to the recycling of useful metals from secondary solid waste (Schippers et al. 2013; Johnson 2014; Jerez 2017b). A good example is provided by the recovery of rare earth elements (REEs, Reed et al. 2016) or copper from electronic waste (Srichandan et al. 2019). Many advantages of biomining over traditional techniques on Earth also apply to space. For instance, biomining generally requires lower energy compared to traditional mining (Schippers et al. 2013), which will be an advantage in space, where resources are limited and many engineering constraints may be in place. Nevertheless, space conditions and available rock materials are different from those present on Earth and which are commonly used in terrestrial biomining. On one hand, traditional autotrophic and chemolithotrophic microbes used for terrestrial biomining do not need to rely on organic compounds as nutrients, which are very scarce in extraterrestrial environments, to grow (Johansson 1992; Fahrion et al. 2021). On the other hand, rocks present on celestial bodies of mining interest have very diverse compositions. In some cases (e.g., the Moon and some asteroids) sulphide-containing minerals are scarce compared to ore-grade sulphide minerals which are the focus of terrestrial biomining (Lewis 1992; Anand et al. 2012; Righter et al. 2017; Steenstra et al. 2018, 2020; Brounce et al. 2019, 2020). This poses restrictions on the possibility of directly transferring our current knowledge on bioleaching, which is mainly based on chemolithoautotrophic iron- and/or sulphur-oxidising microorganisms, to space. This review explores the topic of space biomining, discussing the main principles and feasibility, and analyses possible applications. We discuss limitations and highlight that, considering the materials available in space, it is necessary to expand our knowledge on organotrophic, cyanobacteria and community-based bioleaching mechanisms. Finally, we propose to consider the addition of biomining compartments to supply basic chemical requirements for Biological Life-Support Systems (BLSS), and vice versa.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions As the goal for space exploration expands toward establishing permanent settlements in space, space biomining is generating an increasing interest. The main space agencies have recognized its potential in their roadmaps. Many are the advantages, as terrestrial biomining is considered a sustainable approach in both the economic and environmental terms (Jerez 2017a). Moreover, many rocks in the Solar System would be considered low-grade ores for terrestrial standards (Cockell and Santomartino, in press), and biomining on Earth is commonly used to process mine waste, dumps and tailings (Bosecker 1997; Mishra and Rhee 2014). The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to bioremediation, recycling of waste and to support BLSS. Although promising, the science around space biomining is still relatively young. Considering the differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions, including rock type and ore availability, a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be always possible. Energetic and metabolic demands need to be taken into account. Engineering requirements for space biomining reactors will require temperature controls, aeration and stirring under complex and harsh conditions. While most terrestrial biomining knowledge is based on autotrophic microorganisms able to break down sulphidic minerals without the need of carbon compounds, many rocks in the Solar Systems may present a low sulphur content. In these cases, heterotrophic microorganisms could be a better choice, but they would require organic compounds. Moreover, most bioleaching reactions are aerobic, and oxygen itself will be a commodity in space. A careful selection of the most appropriate techniques and microorganisms will be required for any given application, and the optimal solution could include complementary systems (Averesch 2021). Ethic and planetary protection discussions are outside of the aim of this review. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take them into account when planning the preferred method for mining or ISRU in a specific region or planetary body, as they could pose a further limitation. Biomining is one of the possible approaches to achieve ISRU, and its selection over other methods should at least consider all the parameters discussed here. Nevertheless, its advantages make it pivotal to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications. This includes learning more on the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expanding our knowledge on organotrophic, cyanobacteria and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, on anaerobic biomining, and investigating the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations.",

Copyright notice ID: 8739323 PMID: 34993644 Abstract As we aim to expand human presence in space, we need to find viable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources. Space biomining of the Moon, Mars and asteroids has been indicated as one of the promising approaches to achieve in-situ resource utilization by the main space agencies. Structural and expensive metals, essential mineral nutrients, water, oxygen and volatiles could be potentially extracted from extraterrestrial regolith and rocks using microbial-based biotechnologies. The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to space bioremediation, recycling of waste and to reinforce regenerative life support systems. However, the science around space biomining is still young. Relevant differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions exist, including the rock types and ores available for mining, and a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be a possibility. It is, therefore, necessary to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications to learn the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expand our knowledge on organotrophic and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, as well as on anaerobic biomining, and investigate the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations posed by the space environments. Keywords: Space biomining, ISRU, Space bioleaching, BLSS, Space microbiology, Bioremediation, Space sustainabilityIntroduction As the goal for human space exploration moves farther from Earth, relying on a constant resupply of resources from Earth becomes less viable. In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) approaches have the aim of enabling sustainable exploration and settlement of space, by mitigating the need of importing goods and materials from Earth (NASA-ASEE 1992; Anand et al. 2012; Montague et al. 2012; Menezes et al. 2015b; Verseux et al. 2016). Microbial-based biotechnologies and biomanufacturing approaches have demonstrated their high efficacy in several applications and may become a key component of future ISRU strategies (Brown et al. 2008; Slenzka and Kempf 2010; Montague et al. 2012; Verseux et al. 2016; Nangle et al. 2020; Volponi and Lasseur 2020; Berliner et al. 2021; Castelein et al. 2021; Keller et al. 2021). Minerals and metals will be necessary resources for construction, infrastructure and manufacturing. Water, oxygen, volatiles, essential nutrients for human nutrition and soil fertilization, are all elements which will be essential to establish self-sufficient settlements, and that could be obtained from extraterrestrial rocks (Cockell 2011). Mining of these resources will therefore be a priority for an extraterrestrial settlement. Microorganisms can be applied to these needs, extracting useful elements by a technique called biomining or bioleaching. Currently on Earth around 20–25% of copper and 5% of gold are extracted using biomining (Johnson et al. 2013). Bioleaching can provide economic and environmental advantages compared to other methods (Srichandan et al. 2019) and can be used as a complementary technique to extract trace metals from mine waste, or recover low-grade ores which cannot be treated by conventional methods (Bosecker 1997). Mining processes produce an enormous amount of waste low-grade rock material and mill tailings, which often still contain useful trace elements that cannot be further recovered by traditional methods. However, these can be accessible to small microbial cells, as an effect of specific types of metabolism (Blowes et al. 2003; Schippers et al. 2013; Johnson 2014; Jerez 2017a). With the same principle, bioleaching techniques can be applied to the recycling of useful metals from secondary solid waste (Schippers et al. 2013; Johnson 2014; Jerez 2017b). A good example is provided by the recovery of rare earth elements (REEs, Reed et al. 2016) or copper from electronic waste (Srichandan et al. 2019). Many advantages of biomining over traditional techniques on Earth also apply to space. For instance, biomining generally requires lower energy compared to traditional mining (Schippers et al. 2013), which will be an advantage in space, where resources are limited and many engineering constraints may be in place. Nevertheless, space conditions and available rock materials are different from those present on Earth and which are commonly used in terrestrial biomining. On one hand, traditional autotrophic and chemolithotrophic microbes used for terrestrial biomining do not need to rely on organic compounds as nutrients, which are very scarce in extraterrestrial environments, to grow (Johansson 1992; Fahrion et al. 2021). On the other hand, rocks present on celestial bodies of mining interest have very diverse compositions. In some cases (e.g., the Moon and some asteroids) sulphide-containing minerals are scarce compared to ore-grade sulphide minerals which are the focus of terrestrial biomining (Lewis 1992; Anand et al. 2012; Righter et al. 2017; Steenstra et al. 2018, 2020; Brounce et al. 2019, 2020). This poses restrictions on the possibility of directly transferring our current knowledge on bioleaching, which is mainly based on chemolithoautotrophic iron- and/or sulphur-oxidising microorganisms, to space. This review explores the topic of space biomining, discussing the main principles and feasibility, and analyses possible applications. We discuss limitations and highlight that, considering the materials available in space, it is necessary to expand our knowledge on organotrophic, cyanobacteria and community-based bioleaching mechanisms. Finally, we propose to consider the addition of biomining compartments to supply basic chemical requirements for Biological Life-Support Systems (BLSS), and vice versa.Space biomining principles When talking about space biomining for ISRU, the following three main questions have to be addressed: (1) What elements do we need to obtain for a given application? (2) Where can we find them? (3) Which mining strategy would work best (this could exclude biomining in some cases)? We will try to address these questions, to the best of our knowledge, in this section. Answering these questions can be complex, as it involves an interdisciplinary knowledge of the space conditions present on the planetary body we want to mine, the type of rocks and mineral compositions available (including their intrinsic leachability and toxicity), the engineering technologies and biotechnologies required, in-space operational approach (a thorough discussion on the requirements for life support systems and ISRU for space exploration, although focused on cyanobacteria-based structures, has been reported in Keller et al. 2021), and the appropriate microorganism(s) and its metabolism(s) (Averesch 2021). The situation becomes even more complicated when discussing asteroid biomining, given that the mined resources would likely not be used in situ, therefore requiring additional transport to the location of utilization (see Sect. 4.3). To answer the first question, elements of high interest from the space biomining perspective vary depending on the aim (Cockell 2011; Raafat et al. 2013). Generally speaking, elements and molecules of interest for the establishment of a human settlements are water, molecular oxygen, essential mineral nutrients (e.g., potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, sulphur), gaseous volatiles (e.g., hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, helium), structural metals such as iron, copper, nickel and vanadium, and elements useful for electronic devices such as silicon and REEs (Menezes et al. 2015a, b). Some of these, especially volatiles, could be used to produce fuel or water (such as hydrogen, Klas et al. 2015). Of great economic interest are also elements as platinum group elements (PGE), gold, and silver, which are currently expensive. This list is not intended to be complete. It must be noted that many rocks in the Solar System would be regarded as low-grade ores, in respect to those considered suitable for mining on Earth (Cockell and Santomartino, in press). However, biomining on Earth is often used to process mine waste, dumps and tailings which cannot be easily treated by conventional methods (Bosecker 1997; Mishra and Rhee 2014; Klas et al. 2015). Growth, and in some cases bioleaching, of diverse microorganisms on extraterrestrial rocks or simulants have been demonstrated (Gronstal et al. 2009; Olsson-Francis and Cockell 2010; Kölbl et al. 2017; Metzger et al. 2020; Volger et al. 2020; Milojevic et al. 2021), suggesting that, with the appropriate selection of species or consortia and conditions, microbial interaction with extraterrestrial substrate is possible. Moreover, space biomining experiments have been already performed in space. These include BioRock (Cockell et al. 2020, 2021; Santomartino et al. 2020) and BioAsteroid (2020/2021, data analysis in preparation), both performed onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and a preparative mission for BioRock (Byloos et al. 2017). Although not intended as fully scaled-up biomining experiments, they first demonstrated the feasibility of biomining in space using heterotrophic microorganisms (bacteria and fungi), and basalt or meteorite as substrates. Space conditions and effects on biomining Environments outside Earth show a variety of conditions which differ from those present on Earth’s surface. Their effects on microbial behaviour at different levels (e.g., growth, survival, resistance, virulence, biofilm formation) have been widely reported (reviewed in Horneck et al. 2010; Senatore et al. 2018), and still there is much yet to be understood (Cockell 2021). Space can be considered an umbrella term which includes a variety of environments, each one with its own characteristics. For the aim of this review, we will report the following conditions present in three different space environments of relevance for the space biomining perspective: Mars, the Moon and asteroids (Table 1). On asteroids, given their small mass, we can generally assume conditions equivalent to that of spaceflight beyond Earth’s Van Allen belts, as described below. Table 1. Conditions on Moon, Mars and asteroids that could influence space biomining, compared to those on Earth Condition Planetary body Mars Moon Asteroids Earth Gravity 0.38×g 0.16×g Micro to centigravity 1×g Ionizing radiations ~ 20 µGy/hour (GCR, SEP) ~ 13.2 µGy/hour (GCR, SEP) (GCR, SEP) 0.034–0.114 µGy/hour (Baumstark-Khan and Facius 2002) Atmosphere composition 95% CO2, 2.8% N2, 2.1% Ar, trace gases Negligible Absent 78% N2, 20.9% O2, 0.9% Ar, 0.04% CO2, trace gases Pressure 6.1 mbar 3 × 10–15 bar Vacuum 1 bar (at sea level) Temperature − 153 °C to + 20 °C − 178 °C to + 124 °C Depends on the asteroid.

GCR galactic cosmic rays, SEP Solar energetic particlesAll the conditions described here assume that the biomining operation has access to liquid water, an essential requirement for life (Cockell 2021). Water must either be obtained on the body of interest or imported. Although this is critical for biomining operations, here we focus on the other environmental conditions within a biomining reactor that influence growth within a liquid environment. i.Gravity Gravity is proportional to the mass of the celestial body under examination. As a consequence, gravities at the surface of Mars, the Moon and asteroids are lower than on Earth (9.8 m/s2, or 1×g). Mars has a gravity regimen of 3.7 m/s2 (~ 0.38×g), the Moon 1.62 m/s2 (~ 0.16×g). Microgravity (µg or ~ 10–6×g) is the gravity condition generally experienced in a spacecraft in a free trajectory (either in transit from one celestial body to another, or in orbit around one; Horneck et al. 2010; Zea et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2018). Gravitational levels at the surface of an asteroid depend on the mass and the irregularity of its shape. While for more massive objects such as Ceres (0.27 m/s2, or ~ 0.03×g), now considered a dwarf planet, gravity may be slightly higher (centigravity, in fact), the majority of asteroids are expected to have a gravity regimen similar to microgravity (Klas et al. 2015). It has been reported that cells with a diameter of less than 10 µm, which is the case for bacteria, archaea and many fungi, are too small to be directly affected by gravity or the lack thereof (Pollard 1965; Horneck et al. 2010; Zea et al. 2017). Instead, the responses observed are likely to be the indirect effects of altered extracellular environment where mass transport to and from the cell is limited to Brownian motion, limiting nutrient availability and resulting in the build-up of metabolic by-products with respect to 1×g (Bosecker 1997; Zea 2015; Zea et al. 2016). However, microbial structures, namely biofilms, can be orders of magnitude larger. While biofilm growth is well known to occur on spacecraft components during spaceflight (McLean et al. 2001; Zea et al. 2020), controlled experiments have not shown consistent results, as increase, decrease, and no changes on biofilms grown in microgravity with respect to controls on Earth have been reported (reviewed in Zea et al. 2018). However, the effects of gravity on microbe-mineral interaction have not been characterized yet and should be further investigated. BioRock, a recent space biomining experiment mentioned above, showed no difference in final cell concentrations for three biomining bacterial species after 3 weeks of growth under terrestrial, Martian and micro-gravity (Santomartino et al. 2020). This result suggests that space microbial biotechnologies, including biomining, could be indifferent to gravitational conditions. Nevertheless, various hardware settings and reactor volumes may lead to divergent results, and other microbial species could react differently. Furthermore, processes that require gravity (e.g. sedimentation) will be impacted by changes in gravitational conditions. ii.Radiation Earth’s magnetosphere and atmosphere protect us on the surface from most of the radiation environment experienced in space. Beyond the Van Allen belts (Prölss 2004), usually referred to as ‘deep space’, a radiation environment, mostly consisting of (i) galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and (ii) Solar energetic particles (SEP), exists (Zeitlin et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2020). In the case of the lunar surface, neutrons as secondary particles arising from the interaction of GCRs and SEP’s and the regolith may have an impact on biological systems that is yet unknown (Horneck et al. 2010; Klas et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2020). Hence, biomining operations beyond the Van Allen belts (i.e., on the Moon, Mars, and asteroids) need to consider the higher radiation environment. A wide literature studied microbial response and resistance to high dose of space radiations, including long-term exposure experiments outside the ISS (Horneck et al. 2012). Many of these studies focused on resistance and survival after exposure in a dried or dormant state. Among the microorganisms that showed a higher resistance to space radiations we can find Chrooccocidiopsis (Cockell et al. 2005; Billi et al. 2019), Bacillus subtilis (Moeller et al. 2014; Ulrich et al. 2018; Nicholson and Ricco 2020) and Deinococcus radiodurans (Mattimore and Battista 1996; Minton 1996), and some fungi as Aspergillus niger (Cortesão et al. 2020). Many of these have been also tested for their biomining (Brandl et al. 1999; Rozas et al. 2017; Faraji et al. 2018; Giese et al. 2019) or biosorption (Liu et al. 2012; Jaafar et al. 2015) capacity, suggesting a possible role for biomining in space. It must be noted that some of the molecular mechanisms of radiation (and related stresses) tolerance require the entrance of the cell in a dormant state (e.g., endospore formation, desiccation). These may not be useful in a context of space biomining, in which metabolically active cells are required. Further research is, therefore, necessary to link these two fields of study, in order to understand the most suitable microorganisms or mechanisms for long-term biomining operations. iii.Atmosphere composition and pressure Mars has a thin atmosphere, composed of approximately 95% of CO2, 2.8% of N2, 2,1% Ar, trace gases including oxygen (0.13%) and hydrogen (Franz et al. 2017), and dust, with an average pressure at the surface of 6.1 mbar (Haberle 2015). Lunar atmosphere (composed of argon, helium, neon, sodium, potassium, hydrogen, trace elements and dust), with a pressure at the surface of 3 × 10–15 bar and an average abundance at the surface of 2 × 105 particles/cm3, is considered negligible (Stern 1999; Lawson et al. 2005). Asteroids, including Ceres, possess no atmosphere (Hughes 1994, Table 1). From a biomining perspective, the absence of oxygen constitutes a clear problem for those applications requiring aerobic microorganisms. The majority of bioleaching mechanisms elucidated so far occur in aerobic conditions. Nevertheless, anaerobic bioleaching has been demonstrated for some bacteria, although the mechanisms are not fully understood yet (Singh and Cameotra 2015). In anaerobic reductive dissolution, Fe3+ is used as electron acceptor. A. ferrooxidans, for instance, can catalyse the reduction of Fe3+ under anaerobic and acidic conditions, coupled with oxidation of a c-type cytochrome (Ohmura et al. 2002; Hallberg et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2013; Singh and Cameotra 2015; Marrero et al. 2020). Shewanella onediensis, a facultative anaerobe, could extract iron from lunar and Martian simulants under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Castelein et al. 2021). Microorganisms with alternative types of metabolism, or bioengineering approaches, may also be used. More problematic may be the low pressure or, in the case of the Moon and asteroids, vacuum. Pressure is one of the parameters that can profoundly influence microbial proliferation, mostly due to desiccation and reduced gas concentration, and Martian atmospheric pressure is already too low to support most microbial growth (Schwendner and Schuerger 2020; Verseux 2020). The current lowest pressure recorded for microbial growth is 0.7 kPa (7 mbar; Schuerger and Nicholson 2016). Nevertheless, low-pressure vacuum is used in biotechnologies, including biomining (Gnida 2020), and a bioreactor using low-pressure Mars-similar gas composition was successfully developed for cyanobacterial growth (Verseux et al. 2021). This suggests that, with the appropriate adaptation and engineering, challenges posed by extraterrestrial atmospheric composition and pressure could be overcome not to limit biomining applications. Low pressure could, indeed, reduce the engineering requirements of bioreactors. iv.Temperature Temperature can influence not only microbial growth, but also the availability of liquid water for medium growth. Considering the prohibitive space temperatures and variations, discussed below, any space biotechnological application will need to use temperature-controlled bioreactors. However, temperatures of biological-based processes are generally lower than those using chemical or physical processes (Johnson 2014), and bioengineering and synthetic biology approaches could improve biomining capacity at low temperatures in order to decrease energy requirements. Martian surface temperature undergo considerable variations, leading to values varying from − 153 to + 20 °C (Murphy et al. 1990; Haberle 2015). Due to the negligible atmosphere, surface temperature on the Moon varies between − 178 °C and + 124 °C (Williams et al. 2017). Asteroid surface temperatures depend on the distance from the Sun as well as from local differences in composition and topographic features, and they can vary largely among asteroids. On Ceres, surface temperatures oscillates between − 143 and − 73 °C, and similar conditions can be expected on smaller asteroids. For example, the highest surface temperature on asteroid 21 Lutetia, measured by Visible, InfraRed, and Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) on Rosetta, was − 28 °C (Coradini et al. 2011), and the surface temperature of Ryugu, measured by the Japanese Hayabusa2 orbiter, varies between − 50 °C and + 60 °C (Okada et al. 2020). In other words, on all extraterrestrial bodies known, temperatures tend to generally exceed the known limits to life, implying that biomining operations will need to be conducted under strict temperature control. v.Rock composition, regolith and minerals Regolith and rock composition need to be taken into account when deciding which biomining microorganism or technique to use in a given region of a planetary body, to extract the desired element(s), especially considering that they could also contain toxic compounds, for instance perchlorates (Hecht et al. 2009; Linnarsson et al. 2012; Kounaves et al. 2014; Wadsworth and Cockell 2017). Fine regolith is particularly interesting from the mining perspective, as extracting elements from it would spare the energy required for rock crushing (Carter 1992). The composition of Mars and Moon crusts have been highly studied and characterized. This allowed the preparation of several Martian and lunar analogue materials, which can be used to test if they could provide good substrates for microbial growth and elemental extraction (Olsson-Francis and Cockell 2010). A variety of meteorites are available to study asteroid composition, and microbial growth on meteorites has been demonstrated (Tait et al. 2017; Milojevic et al. 2019). Our knowledge on Martian rock composition comes from landers, orbiting spacecrafts and Martian meteorite data. Martian bulk crust is mostly igneous and basaltic (McSween et al. 2009; Ehlmann and Edwards 2014; Yoshizaki and McDonough 2020), with a high level of oxidized iron and magnesium (Clark 1993; Rieder et al. 1997; Yen et al. 2005; McSween et al. 2009). Major minerals present in the Martian crust are silicates such as plagioclase, pyroxene and olivine (Ehlmann and Edwards 2014). FeO is also particularly abundant (Taylor 2013). Previous studies reported a high sulphur composition in Martian surface, mostly in the form of sulphate minerals (Greenwood et al. 2000; Franz et al. 2019). Clay, carbonate and sulphate deposits have been found, and calcium, iron and magnesium sulphate minerals have been identified from landers and orbital data (Ehlmann and Edwards 2014). However, recent estimations on sulphur abundance in Martian interiors suggest that sulphur and volatile content could be much less than previously indicated (Wang and Becker 2017; Franz et al. 2019; Yoshizaki and McDonough 2020), and sulphur has been found in small scale in certain zones of Martian surface (Ehlmann and dwards 2014). Zinc content is quite high while copper may be less present than on Earth, although copper-rich deposits could exist in specific Martian regions (Payré et al. 2019). Lunar composition is largely silica-saturated basalts, anorthosite and breccia (Jolliff 2008); however, specific compositions differ around the crust, and between highlands and maria (Jolliff et al. 2000; Arai et al. 2008). Therefore, the relative abundance of minerals in lunar rocks or regolith depends on the location (Sivakumar et al. 2017). They include plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, ilmenite, spinel and less abundant minerals (Meyer 2003; Ohtake et al. 2009; Anand et al. 2012; Sivakumar et al. 2017), and they are anhydrous and reduced (Jolliff 2008). Interestingly, new mineral species have been identified on the Moon, for instance tranquillityite (Jolliff 2008). Sulphide-bearing apatite was also discovered in lunar rocks, although apatite is present only as accessory phases (Brounce et al. 2019, 2020), as well as sulphides (Anand et al. 2012). Therefore, sulphur appears to be less abundant on the Moon compared to Mars and some asteroids (Righter et al. 2017; Steenstra et al. 2018). Lunar regolith follows a similar composition dominated by aluminosilicate basic rocks (anorthosites, nortic anorthosites, gabbroic anorthosite; Ohtake et al. 2009), with particle size between 10 nm and 100 µm. Mining fine lunar regolith has been proposed as particularly interesting from the mining perspective, because it would not require rock crushing (Carter 1992). Moreover, lunar regolith presents solar wind implanted volatiles of great interest for ISRU, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon and helium (Anand et al. 2012). The presence of helium has attracted interest, as initial calculations estimated a possible cost-efficient transport to Earth as a source of clean energy (Wittenberg et al. 1986). However, more recent evaluations are less positive (Carter 1992; Anand et al. 2012). Particularly promising from a biomining perspective is also a region named Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT), characterized by high percentage of potassium, REEs, phosphorus and thorium (Taylor et al. 2006). Owing to the large number of different types of asteroids, specific cases should be considered when discussing asteroid biomining. Meteorites are made of material from diverse planetary bodies, including asteroids (Housen et al. 1979), but asteroid composition varies widely depending on the type. A complete description of asteroidal composition is beyond the scope of this review; however, information comes largely from the analysis of available meteorites, which are mainly chondrites (Lewis 1992; Yoshizaki and McDonough 2021). Meteorites can be divided into stony, stony-iron and iron. Stony chondritic meteorites are a class of undifferentiated meteorites that are highly interesting from the biomining perspective and compose the large part of those that fall on Earth. Composition varies largely between types. Carbonaceous chondrites (C chondrites) are particularly rich in organic compounds, nitrogen and sulphur; enstatite chondrites (E chondrites) are highly reduced and contain silicon, iron, nickel and sulphides; the most abundant group falls in the intermediate categories of H, L and LL chondrites, with free metal elements, decreasing iron content and a lower presence of sulphur in respect to the former two (Lewis 1992). Water, volatiles, organic compounds, elements as the platinum group elements (PGE: platinum, osmium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and iridium) and more common metals such as iron or nickel can be present, in quantities depending on the asteroid type (Klas et al. 2015; Steenstra et al. 2018, 2020). Sulphur depletion on some asteroids and meteorite surfaces has been documented, as a consequence of space weathering of iron sulphides (Matsumoto et al. 2020). To mention a few notable asteroid examples, 21 Lutetia has a metal-rich composition with mafic silicate minerals poor in iron and hydrated minerals (Coradini et al. 2011), Ceres is rich in hydrated minerals, ammoniated phyllosilicates and carbonates, salts and organic material (De Sanctis et al. 2017). Similarly, 24 Themis (Campins et al. 2010) and Bennu (Lauretta et al. 2019) have water and organic compounds on their surface. Samples from Itokawa (S-type asteroid), obtained in the Hayabusa mission, revealed not only a composition similar to LL-chondrites, but also provided insights into regolith composition and properties (Tsuchiyama et al. 2011).We will shortly have data from the JAXA Hayabusa2 and the NASA OSIRIS-Rex missions on the returning samples from Ryugu and Bennu, respectively. Crucial within the context of all these materials is that, when they are added to a liquid water environment for biomining, they do not result in water activity levels or toxicity that makes them uninhabitable for biomining organisms. Unless the parent material contains high concentrations of salts (e.g., NaCl) there is no a priori reason why any of the materials discussed above should result in unsuitable water activities. The potential toxicity caused by ions (e.g., heavy metals) will depend on the material and the organisms used, but clearly this must be considered for any given combination of minerals and biomining organisms proposed (Averesch 2021). Terrestrial biomining mechanisms and space applicability Bioleaching can be performed by chemolithotrophic and organotrophic microorganisms (Asghari et al. 2013; Srichandan et al. 2019). In most cases, consortia of microorganisms and biofilm formation have an important role in improving and enhancing biomining, compared to single-species approaches. Moreover, biotechnological and synthetic biology techniques can be applied to ameliorate microbial resistance to toxic compounds and enhance metal extraction. All these concepts can be applied to space biomining. Chemolithotroph microorganisms This first group includes the most commonly used and characterized biomining organisms, autotrophic iron-oxidising and/or sulphur-oxidising microorganisms which thrive at low pH. Low pH allows many metal ions, such as iron, to remain in solution, although neutral-pH biomining is possible (Blowes et al. 2003). These microorganisms include mesophilic bacteria (optimum 28–37 °C), moderate thermophilic bacteria (40–60 °C) and thermophile chemolithotrophs (60–80 °C), which commonly belong to archaea (Bosecker 1997; Asghari et al. 2013; Srichandan et al. 2019). The genera Acidithiobacillus, Thiobacillus and Leptospirillium contain a large proportion of these microorganisms, and they have been often isolated from mine-drainage sites (Blowes et al. 2003). Some archaea include the genera Acidianus, Ferroplasma, Metallosphaera and Sulfolobus (Schippers et al. 2013). Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, an iron and sulphur oxidizing microorganism, and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, a strictly sulphur oxidizing bacterium, are two of the most commonly used bacteria in bioleaching (Levicán et al. 2008). On Earth, metals of interest are often embedded into sulphidic minerals (e.g., iron in pyrite FeS2, copper in chalcopyrite CuFeS2, and molybdenum in molybdenite MoS2). The processes of metal dissolution performed by chemolithotrophs includes the biological oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, which in turn oxidises the sulphide mineral to sulphate and sulphuric acid. This latter maintains the low pH required to improve metal solubilisation (Olson et al. 2003; Asghari et al. 2013; Schippers et al. 2013; Singh and Cameotra 2015; Marrero et al. 2020). Metal sulphide dissolution can occur by two main pathways, depending on the mineral species (i.e., electronic configuration and consequent reactivity to proton attack) and named after the intermediate that is formed: (a) thiosulphate (S2O32−) pathway, enabling the solubilization of acid-insoluble metal sulphides minerals, and (b) polysulphide (H2Sn) pathway, which can solubilize acid-soluble minerals (Schippers and Sand 1999; Rohwerder et al. 2003; Marrero et al 2020). The latter can be solubilized by sulphur-oxidizing bacteria, since the process does not necessarily require Fe3+. These microorganisms are also required to dissolve the elemental sulphur which is formed during the process (Rohwerder et al. 2003). Metal sulphide dissolution can occur by contact and non-contact mechanisms, although it has been recently suggested that the two mechanisms are similar (Sand et al. 2001; Rohwerder et al. 2003; Srichandan et al. 2019). Details on these, and on the importance of biofilms for bioleaching, are discussed in Sect. 3.2.4. More recently, reductive dissolution of ferric ion in oxidized ores (e.g. laterites) from A. ferrooxidans has been demonstrated. In this process, anaerobic conditions can be used as Fe3+ is the terminal electron acceptor (Hallberg et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2013; Singh and Cameotra 2015). Elemental sulphur is, however, required as an energy source (Hallberg et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2013; Singh and Cameotra 2015), and the mechanisms still need to be fully elucidated (Singh and Cameotra 2015; Marrero et al. 2020). The use of chemolithotroph microorganisms in space biomining has two main advantages: first, the mechanisms have been widely characterized and second, they do not require the presence of organic compounds to grow (Averesch 2021). Growth, interaction and metal extraction from space rocks/regolith or analogues using chemolithotroph microorganisms have been demonstrated (González-Toril et al. 2005; Gronstal et al. 2009; Kölbl et al. 2017; Tait et al. 2017; Milojevic et al. 2021). However, as discussed in Sect. 3.1, mineral composition of space rocks of biomining interest can differ widely not only among planetary bodies, but also within the same planet or asteroid. This type of bioleaching microorganisms could not be applied, or be less efficient, to space rocks with low sulphur content, for instance the Moon, some asteroids and potentially some Martian regions (Fig. 1, see also Sect. 3.1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Diagram summarizing the main types of biomining/bioleaching microorganisms and mechanisms, and their potential space applicability taking into account the general surface composition and mineral content of Mars, Moon and asteroids. The central ‘bioengineering’ panel highlights the potential use of bioengineering and synthetic biology approaches to enhance and overcome possible limitations of wild type microorganisms. Sphere colour indicates the tentative applicability to planetary bodies, based on the general crust composition. Other parameters (atmosphere, pressure, gravity, temperature, etc.) have not been considered hereOrganotroph microorganisms The second group of bioleaching microorganisms includes organotrophic bacteria and fungi. These are heterotrophic organisms which require organic compounds as a source of carbon for their metabolism, and they can solubilize oxidic, silicious and carbonaceous materials (Asghari et al. 2013). The metal solubilization of the ore occurs by the action of (i) organic acids or (ii) hydrogen cyanide produced by the bacterial or fungal cell. In this case, bioleaching can occur at circumneutral or slightly alkaline pH (Bosecker 1997). (i) Regarding the first mechanism, fungi have been particularly characterized for their organic acid-mediated bioleaching capacity, which can occur by (a) acidolysis, (b) complexolysis, (c) redoxolysis and (d) bioaccumulation (Asghari et al. 2013; Srichandan et al. 2019). (a) In acidolysis, protons from the organic acid react with the mineral surface, weakening the bonds and consequently releasing the metal of interest. Concurrently, (b) complexolysis can also happen, in which complexation between the metal and the organic acid, or more rarely amminoacids (Maneesuwannarat et al. 2019), occurs. (c) During redoxolysis, metal solubilization is promoted by its enzymatic oxidation or reduction, while in (d) bioaccumulation the soluble metal ions can be transported through the cell membrane and accumulate as solid particle within the cell or in vacuoles (Asghari et al. 2013; Srichandan et al. 2019). The organic acids identified to be associated with bioleaching include citric acid, gluconic acid, oxalic acid, citramalic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid and itaconic acid (Gadd 1999; Adeleke et al. 2010; Amin et al. 2014; Brisson et al. 2016, 2020). Fungal bioleaching species include, but is not limited to, Penicillium spp. (Franz et al. 1991; Bosecker 1997; Ambreen et al. 2002; Adeleke et al. 2010), Aspergillus spp, (Brisson et al. 2016; Din et al. 2020) and Paecilomyces spp. (Brisson et al. 2016, 2020). Bacterial species include Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Bacillus spp. (Reed et al. 2016; Rozas et al. 2017; Barnett et al. 2018; Giese et al. 2019). Brisson and colleagues (Brisson et al. 2020) recently performed a thorough metabolomic study which suggested that bioleaching of a given element could be mediated by specific organic acids, rather than organic acids in general. (ii) The second group of organotrophic bioleaching microorganisms include species producing hydrogen cyanide (HCN, also called cyanogenic microorganisms), that use glycine for its production. HCN formation is usually an aerobic process (Srichandan et al. 2019). These organisms can perform bioleaching at mild temperatures (25–35 °C) and a circum-neutral to basic pH (7–11; Valix 2017). Cyanide forms complexes with the metals, whose solubility in water and chemical stability are highly increased. Many metal and metalloids, including precious elements such as gold, platinum and silver, have been successfully extracted from electronic waste using cyanogenic microorganisms, which include Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli and Chromobacterium violaceum (Valix 2017). Notably, cyanobacteria have been shown to perform bioleaching as well (Cecal et al. 2000; Singh 2020). Despite being autotrophic organisms, their bioleaching mechanisms are similar to those of organotrophic microorganisms and involve biosorption through polysaccharides and organic acids (containing amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl and carbonyl groups) present on the cell surface and in biofilms (Huang et al. 2020; Singh 2020). Extraction of REEs and vanadium from basalt (Mars and Moon analogue rock) using organotrophic bacteria (Sphingomonas desiccabilis and Bacillus subtilis) was successfully performed on the ISS under Martian gravity and microgravity (Cockell et al. 2020, 2021), while copper, iron and magnesium were extracted by Cupriavidus metallidurans from basalt after three months of spaceflight (Byloos et al. 2017). Although used also for extraction from sulphide minerals (Johnson and Roberto 1997), these microorganisms are particularly useful for recovery of metals from non-sulphidic minerals and industrial waste that do not contain the sulphur necessary to sustain chemolithotroph growth (Asghari et al. 2013; Hosseini Nasab et al. 2020). Hence, organotrophic microorganisms with demonstrated biomining capacity could be applied to space biomining to extract elements from those rocks and regolith with low sulphur content, for instance lunar rocks (see also Sect. 3.1). A tentative diagram showing potential applications of biomining mechanisms to space, based on general surface composition of planetary bodies, is shown in Fig. 1. The diagram is not intended as exhaustive or definitive, as other parameters have not been considered, but it shows that careful selection of biomining mechanisms and microorganisms is needed when planning for space applications, as indeed for any space bioengineering and biomanufacturing process (Averesch 2021).Biomining consortia Consortia of microorganisms, rather than single species, are often used in biomining, as they can perform different reactions which eventually lead to the metal extraction (Rawlings and Johnson 2007). In many cases the consortium has increased bioleaching efficacy. Qiu et al. (2015) showed how bioleaching of copper from chalcopyrite was enhanced in a co-culture of A. ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans compared to single cultures (Qiu et al. 2005). The roles that microorganisms can perform in a consortium include the oxidation of the ferrous fraction, the generation of a low pH by oxidation of the sulphur moiety and consequent acidification of the solutions, and the degradation of the organic compounds formed in the process (Johnson 2018). Although some bioleaching microorganisms can perform multiple roles (e.g., A. ferrooxidans), others can perform a single role in the process, such as A. thiooxidans, being a strict sulphur-oxidizing bacterium (Blowes et al. 2003; Levicán et al. 2008). Heterotrophic consortia and mixes of heterotrophic–autotrophic consortia have also been studied (Bryan et al. 2015; Valix 2017). Selection of the appropriate consortium for a given biomining application can occur by a “top-down” approach, in which a mix of microorganisms is naturally selected by growing in the presence of a certain mineral, or by a “bottom-up” approach, in which a consortium is designed by selecting required parameters (Rawlings and Johnson 2007). Bioengineering of consortia has been also attempted (Rawlings and Johnson 2007; Brune and Bayer 2012; Gumulya et al. 2018). All these approaches are promising from a space biomining perspective, although they may be limited by the necessity to optimize consortia using rock and regolith simulant, when real space samples are not available. The possibility to use heterotrophic organisms for non-sulphidic mineral dissolution in space biomining has been discussed. While using these microorganisms may present many other advantages (Averesch 2021), one disadvantage is certainly their requirement for a carbon source. This could be overcome by using a consortium containing heterotrophic biomining microorganisms and cyanobacteria: the latter could produce the organic compounds, and the oxygen, necessary to sustain growth and organic acid production (Verseux et al. 2016; Billi et al. 2021) necessary for biomining in space, without the need to provide these nutrients from external sources. The oxygen production would be useful, as it could sustain aerobic biomining in general. Moreover, cyanobacteria (particularly Anabaena cylindrica) have been demonstrated to successfully leach mineral elements from basalt and anorthosite (Olsson-Francis and Cockell 2010). An attempt to test the efficacy of bioleaching of asteroidal material performed by a small artificial heterotrophic consortium (the bacterium S. desiccabilis plus the fungus P. simplicissimum) in microgravity has been completed on the ISS (BioAsteroid, data in preparation).The role of biofilm formation Microbially mediated leaching of sulphidic minerals can occur by contact and non-contact interaction, although it has been recently suggested that the two mechanisms overlap. In the case of direct interaction, the microbial cell is in contact with the mineral surface through the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and the sulphur fraction is oxidised to sulphate by the Fe3+-glucuronic acids complex in the EPS. In the non-contact mechanism, instead, the microbial planktonic cell acts by oxidizing the Fe2+ and reduced sulphur species that are dissolved in the solution (Sand et al. 2001; Blowes et al. 2003). Biofilm formation is important for both interactions, as it not only enhances the contact of microbial cells with the rock surface, but also increases the concentration of ions and compounds that allow bioleaching, the communication between cells of same or different species, and the resistance to toxic metals and compounds (Noël et al. 2010; Bellenberg et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2014; Gumulya et al. 2018). Indeed, biofilm enhances organotrophic bioleaching as well, through the action of the compounds embedded in the matrix (EPS), including polysaccharides and organic acids (Rohwerder et al. 2003; Yu et al. 2014; Gumulya et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2020). When biofilms may limit the access to the substrate, microorganisms have been demonstrated to modify EPS accordingly (Rohwerder et al. 2003). Many studies on biofilm formation in space demonstrated the production of thicker or structural different biofilms during spaceflights (McLean et al. 2001; Zea et al. 2018, 2020). A study conducted on board the ISS interrogated biofilm formation and found that, under certain conditions, a novel “column and canopy” structure was observed in microgravity (Kim et al. 2013). The BioRock experiment studied microbe–mineral interaction and bioleaching from basalt rock of three heterotrophic bacterial species, showing a positive biofilm formation for S. desiccabilis and C. metallidurans within the rock surface under all the gravity condition tested (microgravity, Martian and terrestrial gravities), particularly around edges and cavities (Santomartino et al. in preparation). S. desiccabilis and B. subtilis were able to extract useful elements under different gravity regimens during the same experiment, suggesting an uninfluential role of gravity on microbial bioleaching mechanisms (Cockell et al. 2020, 2021). The data on biofilm formation and growth will, therefore, provide useful insights into the effects of biofilm formation in space biomining.Bioengineering In the presence of mine ore or waste, microbial growth can be hindered by toxic compounds, heavy metals and stressor factors. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that many extremotolerant and extremophilic microorganisms have been isolated as bioleaching agents. This characteristic of bioleaching organisms is, by itself, of great use when considering space biomining, since extraterrestrial regolith can often bear toxic compounds, such as perchlorates (Hecht et al. 2009; Wadsworth and Cockell 2017). When not endogenous, resistance could be developed by adaptive evolution, random mutagenesis or bioengineering and synthetic biology approaches (Gumulya et al. 2018). Engineering of single species or a microbial consortium to enhance desired characteristics, or reduce the impact of the undesired ones, is possible, although the success rate of the engineering approach depend on the recalcitration of some microorganisms to genetic manipulation (Rawlings and Johnson 2007; Brune and Bayer 2012; Johnson et al. 2013). Synthetic biology approaches can be used to improve the tolerance, and therefore the output, of biomining microorganisms. The concept is not trivial, as bioengineering has been optimized for a few microbial species (e.g., E. coli strains), mainly heterotrophic (Averesch 2021), while tools are rarely available for environmental and undomesticated samples. Gumulya et al. (2018) provides a list of tools developed specifically for a few biomining microorganisms, including A. ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans. In many cases, synthetic biology has been used to improve the resistance of E. coli strains to acid, thermal or heavy metal stress, to mention a few. This is achieved by heterologous expression of proteins of interest, often isolated from bioleaching microorganisms (Gumulya et al. 2018). Nevertheless, attempts to engineer specific biomining microorganisms (Gumulya et al. 2018) and biofilms for biomining applications (Buetti-Dinh et al. 2020) have been performed as well. Deinococcus radiodurans, also known for its astrobiological relevant properties such as resistance to polyextremes and space conditions, has been engineered to enhance its bioremediation capacity (Daly 2000). Attempts to genetically enhance acidophilic biomining microorganisms have been reported (reviewed in Gumulya et al. 2018), for instance by expressing arsenic resistance and rusticyanin proteins in A. ferrooxidans (Liu et al. 2011, 2013). Although synthetic biology applications to biomining are still young, approaches to ameliorate resistance to space conditions, to enhance extraction of elements under these, or overcome issues, could be an excellent opportunity for space biomining, and a wide variety of possible applications have been reported (Cockell 2011; Montague et al. 2012; Menezes et al. 2015b; Rothschild 2016; Verseux et al. 2016). Notably, the importance of synthetic biology approaches for ISRU has been proposed (Cockell 2011; Menezes et al. 2015b; Rothschild 2016; Nangle et al. 2020; Averesch 2021).Space biomining applications Biomining in the context of ISRU and self-sustaining extraterrestrial settlements One of the most relevant applications for space biomining is in ISRU. In particular, Bio-ISRU refers to the use of biotechnologies to achieve the exploitation of resources from planetary bodies (Brown et al. 2008). However, myriad resources will need to be acquired and processed in situ to enable self-sustaining settlements in space, and many commodities will likely require a combination of physico-chemical and biological approaches (Keller et al. 2021). Transportation to and from the settlement and Earth, and between settlements, will require fuel for the transport vehicles. While methane production for Martian architecture (Ash et al. 1978; Musk 2017) may be partly done via biological methods (Klas et al. 2015), oxygen and hydrogen extraction from lunar regolith for chemically based propulsion (Jamanca-Lino 2021) will likely be performed via physico-chemical processes (Schwandt et al. 2012). Other essential resources arise from human needs: water, oxygen, atmospheric pressure, food and waste management. Water can be found in permanently shadowed craters on the Moon and in different locations on Mars and asteroids; this water can also serve to meet oxygen needs. Oxygen and an inert gas like N2 will be needed to reach required atmospheric pressures (Niederwieser et al. 2019). In this context, biomining could be one of the methods to provide the structural metals (e.g., iron, nickel, vanadium, copper) for construction of buildings and machinery, or to build electronic devices and magnets (e.g., REEs, silicon; Cockell 2010, 2011; Montague et al. 2012; Menezes et al. 2015b; Rothschild 2016; Verseux et al. 2016). Bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to recycle useful elements from electric waste (Brandl et al. 1999; Rozas et al. 2017; Srichandan et al. 2019). Apart from structural materials, bioleaching of regolith and rocks could provide water, useful volatiles (e.g., oxygen from the dissolution of oxide minerals, hydrogen, carbon, sulphur) and mineral nutrients (e.g., potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, sulphur) essential for life (Cockell 2010, 2011; Montague et al. 2012; Menezes et al. 2015b; Rothschild 2016; Verseux et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2020). Biomining is not intrinsically a traditional part of BLSS (Eckart 1992). However, the principal and secondary (e.g., waste) products from bioleaching discussed so far could be used to sustain biological compartments in life-support systems, including human crew (see for instance the ESA’s MELiSSA life support project; Gòdia et al. 2002; Lasseur and Mergeay 2021). In turn, bioleaching microorganisms (particularly aerobic and heterotrophic ones) could benefit from waste materials produced from the regenerative support system (Billi et al. 2021; Keller et al. 2021). Considering all this, the addition of a biomining/bioleaching compartment could be a beneficial addition to supply basic chemical requirements for a BLSS, and vice versa (Fig. 2). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Conceptual figure of a biomining/bioleaching compartment in the context of BLSS, based on the regenerative life-support systems MELiSSA project design (Gòdia et al. 2002; Lasseur and Mergeay 2021). Potential useful elements produced by this compartment are shown in orangeBioremediation Similar chemical reactions to those involved in biomining are used to perform bioremediation on Earth, to eliminate toxic and polluting compounds from soil and waters (Gadd 2010). Extremophiles and extremotolerant microorganisms (Jeong and Choi 2020), fungi (e.g., Aspergillus and Penicillium spp.; Yamada-Onodera et al. 2002; Din et al. 2020) and other bacterial species (for instance Sphingomonas; Chen 2012) are often used. The capacity to remove heavy metals, radioactive species (uranium), acids (including acid mine drainage produced through mining and biomining processes), organic pollutants and salts has been demonstrated (Gadd 2010; Brune and Bayer 2012). It is worth mentioning that many of these species can indeed thrive in (extremophiles and polyextremophiles) or tolerate (extremotolerant and polyextremotolerant) a variety of extreme conditions, which might come in handy in space. To mention a few examples, many chemolithotrophic microorganisms used in biomining, such as Acidithiobacillus and Ferroplasma, are acidophiles, while Sulfolobus and Metallosphaera are both acidophiles and thermophiles (Rohwerder et al. 2003; Coker 2016). Regarding organotrophic microorganisms, A. niger spores demonstrated resistance to high doses of radiations (Cortesão et al. 2020), while S. desiccabilis biofilms could withstand desiccation and Martian brines (Stevens et al. 2019), for instance. The lunar and Martian surfaces contain a number of toxic compounds that could hinder not only biomining, but also the settlement itself. Examples include perchlorates on Mars (Hecht et al. 2009; Kounaves et al. 2014) and toxic lunar dusts (Linnarsson et al. 2012). Microorganisms performing biomining could also be selected for bioremediation approaches to ameliorate these components by making them less toxic or removing them. A recent study identified the genes involved in perchlorate resistance from microorganisms isolated from the Atacama desert (Díaz-Rullo et al. 2021). A Chroococcidiopsis species and its derivate (CCMEE 029 and CCMEE 029 P-MRS, respectively) had no negative effect to perchlorate exposure, and the biomass produced could be used to feed an heterotrophic bacterial species (E. coli; Billi et al. 2021). A new record for perchlorate tolerance was reported for the fungus Planococcus halocryophilus (Heinz et al. 2020). Shewanella onediensis was found slightly impacted by perchlorates (Volger et al. 2020), and it was able to reduce chromium, although growth was inhibited at high concentrations of this metal (Middleton et al. 2003). Moreover, biofilms could be used to settle dangerous dusts and enrich regolith with nutritious elements, which will allow the fertilization of soils (Liu et al. 2008; Cockell 2011; Mergelov et al. 2018; Eichler et al. 2021).Asteroid biomining The concept of asteroid mining is slightly different and deserves a separate discussion. While biomining on Mars and the Moon will likely have the aim to directly sustain extraterrestrial settlements located on these planetary bodies, there is no current interest in creating a stable human presence on asteroids (although in the long term this could change). This poses the problem of transporting the extracted materials to their final destination, hence the viability of the process depends on the costs, which depend on the richness of elements and their location (Gertsch 1992), and of course on the engineering constraints. Asteroids of interest from the biomining perspective belong to either the near-Earth objects or the asteroid belt, beyond Mars orbit. For lunar settlements or return to Earth, near-Earth objects could be more appropriate, while for Martian settlements objects from asteroid belt could be used (Gaffey 1992; Gertsch 1992). Molecules of interest from the asteroid biomining perspective are water, volatiles and carbon compounds, expensive (PGE, gold, silver) and common metals (Klas et al. 2015). We discussed in Sect. 3.1.v the wide variety of asteroids and their composition, as well as the fact that our knowledge on these is limited by data coming from the available meteorites and the few returning samples from space missions (Metzger and Britt 2020). It has been estimated that the total number of minor asteroids in the asteroid belt is highly underestimated (Krasinsky et al. 2002). These considerations imply that a wider knowledge on asteroid type and composition is necessary to select objects of interest for space biomining. Asteroid biomining is gaining increasing interest, and a variety of companies are forming to develop engineering strategies (Lewicki et al. 2013), and scientists are assessing microbial growth and colonization of meteorites (Klas et al. 2015; Tait et al. 2017; Milojevic et al. 2019), including the abovementioned BioAsteroid experiment, showing bacterial and fungal mediated leaching of an L-chondrite on the ISS (data under analysis).Benefits for Earth Scientific research topics are naturally interconnected. Owing to the harshness of the space environment, space exploration requires the most advanced human ingenuity and scientific technologies. Once these are developed, they would be available for terrestrial applications and benefit the quality of life on Earth (ISECG 2013). Space microbiology also has a significant impact in our everyday life (Horneck et al. 2010). With this view in mind, it is expected that advances in space biomining will eventually benefit terrestrial biomining technologies (Metzger 2016). It has been proposed that biomining of specific planetary bodies, for instance some asteroids and even the Moon (Carter 1992), could provide useful elements for terrestrial use. However, at present this has not been found to be a viable opportunity. Nevertheless, many realistic benefits can be listed. As mentioned before, the BioRock experiment demonstrated the ability of S. desiccabilis to extract REEs and vanadium under a variety of gravity conditions on the ISS (Cockell et al. 2020, 2021). This was the first demonstration of the ability of S. desiccabilis to perform biomining, providing a novel microorganism for terrestrial applications. Improvement of biomining technologies, including amelioration of strains for the extraction of elements from low-grade ores and under extreme conditions could provide tools for similar aims on Earth. Designing of highly efficient biomining reactors and hardware would be another applicable benefit. The same concept could be easily applied to bioremediation, hence to environmental issues as follows: microorganisms with demonstrated tolerance and capacity to bioaccumulate and remediate toxic compounds under the harsh Martian and lunar conditions could be used for terrestrial purposes, or inform us on how to achieve similar goals here. Augmentation of sustainable approaches by learning from space biotechnologies will be a great benefit for Earth. The major space agencies aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (https://sdgs.un.org/goals), and these principles can be applied to human space exploration. Biomining is widely recognized to be more environmental friendly in respect to traditional mining approaches (Jerez 2017a); hence learning how to improve bioleaching from advancements in the challenging field of space biomining would also have a positive environmental impact on Earth. Moreover, improving the design of self-sustaining extraterrestrial settlements, for instance by including a biomining compartment, electronic waste recycling and synthetic biology approaches to engineer biomining microorganisms to use different waste as nutrients (e.g., plastics), would inform on terrestrial strategies to improve circular economy approaches.Conclusions As the goal for space exploration expands toward establishing permanent settlements in space, space biomining is generating an increasing interest. The main space agencies have recognized its potential in their roadmaps. Many are the advantages, as terrestrial biomining is considered a sustainable approach in both the economic and environmental terms (Jerez 2017a). Moreover, many rocks in the Solar System would be considered low-grade ores for terrestrial standards (Cockell and Santomartino, in press), and biomining on Earth is commonly used to process mine waste, dumps and tailings (Bosecker 1997; Mishra and Rhee 2014). The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to bioremediation, recycling of waste and to support BLSS. Although promising, the science around space biomining is still relatively young. Considering the differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions, including rock type and ore availability, a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be always possible. Energetic and metabolic demands need to be taken into account. Engineering requirements for space biomining reactors will require temperature controls, aeration and stirring under complex and harsh conditions. While most terrestrial biomining knowledge is based on autotrophic microorganisms able to break down sulphidic minerals without the need of carbon compounds, many rocks in the Solar Systems may present a low sulphur content. In these cases, heterotrophic microorganisms could be a better choice, but they would require organic compounds. Moreover, most bioleaching reactions are aerobic, and oxygen itself will be a commodity in space. A careful selection of the most appropriate techniques and microorganisms will be required for any given application, and the optimal solution could include complementary systems (Averesch 2021). Ethic and planetary protection discussions are outside of the aim of this review. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take them into account when planning the preferred method for mining or ISRU in a specific region or planetary body, as they could pose a further limitation. Biomining is one of the possible approaches to achieve ISRU, and its selection over other methods should at least consider all the parameters discussed here. Nevertheless, its advantages make it pivotal to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications. This includes learning more on the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expanding our knowledge on organotrophic, cyanobacteria and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, on anaerobic biomining, and investigating the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations.Acknowledgements Rosa Santomartino and Charles S.
