    "abstract": "Abstract The hindlimb unloading (HU) model has been used extensively to simulate the cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight with its application expanding to study immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system responses, among others. Most HU studies are performed with singly housed animals, although social isolation also can substantially impact behavior and physiology, and therefore may confound HU experimental results. Other HU variants that allow for paired housing have been developed although no systematic assessment has been made to understand the effects of social isolation on HU outcomes. Hence, we aimed to determine the contribution of social isolation to tissue responses to HU. To accomplish this, we developed a refinement to the traditional NASA Ames single housing HU system to accommodate social housing in pairs, retaining desirable features of the original design. We conducted a 30-day HU experiment with adult, female mice that were either singly or socially housed. HU animals in both single and social housing displayed expected musculoskeletal deficits versus housing matched, normally loaded (NL) controls. However, select immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were differentially impacted by the HU social environment relative to matched NL controls. HU led to a reduction in % CD4+ T cells in singly housed, but not in socially housed mice. Unexpectedly, HU increased adrenal gland mass in socially housed but not singly housed mice, while social isolation increased adrenal gland mass in NL controls. HU also led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels at day 30 in both singly and socially housed mice. Thus, musculoskeletal responses to simulated weightlessness are similar regardless of social environment with a few differences in adrenal and immune responses. Our findings show that combined stressors can mask, not only exacerbate, select responses to HU. These findings further expand the utility of the HU model for studying possible combined effects of spaceflight stressors.

    "introduction": "Introduction The spaceflight environment poses significant challenges to multiple organ systems. Microgravity exposure leads to a cephalad fluid shift (Foux et al., 1976; Thornton et al., 1987) as well as osteopenia (Lang et al., 2004) and sarcopenia (LeBlanc et al., 2000). Spaceflight alters electrolyte balance (Vorobiev et al., 1995) as well as endocrine (Stowe et al., 2003, 2011), vision (Zhang and Hargens, 2018) and baroreflex processes (Fritsch et al., 1992; Buckey et al., 1996; Meck et al., 2001). Cardiovascular changes include stiffening of the carotid arteries as seen in astronauts returning from a 6-month ISS mission (Hughson et al., 2016) and transient changes in heart rate variability (Yamamoto et al., 2015). Spaceflight also may lead to CNS changes including a decline in cognitive performance (Eddy et al., 1998). Immune system dysregulation also occurs, characterized by altered immune cell function and reactivation of viruses (Crucian et al., 2015, 2018; Mehta et al., 2017). These findings from astronauts are the main motivation to study rodents flown into space with the rationale that rodents are used extensively to model human conditions on Earth and may prove useful for understanding mechanisms and anticipating human responses to spaceflight. However, limited opportunities for rodent spaceflight studies, along with other challenges of conducting microgravity experiments, stimulated interest in using ground-based rodent models of weightlessness. The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model was developed initially to simulate the responses of the musculoskeletal system to microgravity (Wronski and Morey-Holton, 1987; Morey-Holton et al., 2005; Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016). To date, its use has expanded to study the responses of other organ systems to spaceflight, including immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system (Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016). The HU model also is utilized to study disorders on Earth such as osteopenia and sarcopenia because features of the HU model mimic bedrest and disuse. Initial efforts to generate a rodent model for musculoskeletal unloading entailed use of a back harness for inducing a cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse of the hindlimbs in singly housed animals (Morey, 1979), which was then developed further to introduce tail suspension which improved outcomes (Wronski and Morey-Holton, 1987). This system employs non-invasive attachment of the tail via orthopedic traction tape onto a pulley system that allows for elevation of the hindlimbs; application with the custom-designed cage enables free movement of the animal about the cage (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002; Morey-Holton et al., 2005). Since then, other variants of the HU system emerged and include partial unloading of all four limbs using a custom body harness (Wagner et al., 2010; Ellman et al., 2013; Mortreux et al., 2018), various methods to induce unloading such as surgical piercing of the tail, alternative taping methods, simplified cage systems that restrict movement, and group housing (Ferreira et al., 2011; Maurel et al., 2016). Single versus social housing of rodents under standard, ambulatory conditions, can differentially impact multiple organ systems (e.g., cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous system) known also to be affected by spaceflight (Beisel and Talbot, 1987; Schmitt and Schaffar, 1993; D’Aunno et al., 2003; Migeotte et al., 2003; Pierson et al., 2005; Hughson et al., 2016; Mehta et al., 2017). Social isolation causes anxiety and depressive-like behavior (Djordjevic et al., 2012), disrupted circadian rhythms (Spani et al., 2003), deficits in memory (McLean et al., 2010), activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors and impairments in antioxidant responses in the brain (Djordjevic et al., 2015). Social isolation also can stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Jessop and Bayer, 1989; Ros-Simo and Valverde, 2012; Shetty and Sadananda, 2017), the main neuroendocrine regulator of mammalian stress responses (Bellavance and Rivest, 2014). However, other studies report that social isolation can lead to decrements in circulating corticosterone levels (Djordjevic et al., 2012; Ieraci et al., 2016) although it is not clear whether these reflect an initial downregulation of HPA axis activation or simply the induction of a negative feedback loop after a state of activation. In addition, social isolation in rodents leads to impairments in immune function (Jessop and Bayer, 1989; Clausing et al., 1994; Shanks et al., 1994; Wu et al., 2000; Krugel et al., 2014). Social isolation can be a confounding factor for interpreting experimental outcomes from both rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies. In rats, 9 days of spaceflight reduced periosteal bone formation and bone mass (femur dry weights) in singly housed animals but had minimal effect on bone formation or mass in group housed animals (Morey-Holton et al., 2000). In an interesting study, Tsvirkun et al. (2012) report that HU (in standard, single housing) or social isolation (without unloading) each can perturb blood pressure and heart rate levels. The possible contribution of social isolation to the biological outcomes of HU has not been studied, leaving a number of knowledge gaps in our understanding of the model for simulating weightlessness. It is unclear whether social interactions (social versus single housing) during HU differentially impacts organ systems known to be responsive to HU. Rodent experiments on the International Space Station (ISS), particularly those making use of the NASA Rodent Research habitat, are conducted in group housed conditions whereas most HU studies conducted to date entail use of the standard, single housed HU model. Other groups have developed variants of the HU model that accommodate social housing in pairs (Ferreira et al., 2011; Lloyd et al., 2012; Maurel et al., 2016). However, characterization of these models in side-by-side studies with the traditional singly housed HU model have not been conducted. Hence, there is value to further developing and characterizing the socially housed HU model for simulating weightlessness to better match rodent habitat conditions on the ISS. Addressing these gaps in knowledge will lead to an improved understanding of the contribution of isolation to observed responses to HU, which in turn will improve the ability to extrapolate HU results to humans in space. To address these knowledge gaps, we aimed to (1) develop a refinement to the NASA Ames HU system, which traditionally entails housing mice in isolation (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002; Morey-Holton et al., 2005) to enable housing in social pairs and (2) determine the contribution of social isolation to the HU responses of various tissues. We hypothesized that relative to social housing, single housing exacerbates HU-induced dysfunction in select organ systems. To meet these aims and test the hypothesis, we performed a side-by-side comparison of this alternative social HU system versus the standard NASA Ames single housed design and evaluated the responses of select spaceflight-relevant tissues to HU.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animals and Experiment Design Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition (National Research Council (U.S.) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (U.S.) and National Academies Press (U.S.), 2011). All animal experiments were conducted with prior approval from the NASA Ames Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Sixteen-week old female mice that were to undergo HU were acclimated into HU cages (paired or single housing groups) 3 days prior to the onset of HU (Figure 1). Normally loaded (NL) controls were housed in standard vivarium cages either individually or in pairs. NL controls (either paired or single housing groups) were handled the same way as the HU groups except for the actual attachment of traction tape and tail suspension. Animals were bred at Ames and were wild type littermates of a cross between male mCAT mice [B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-OTC/CAT)4033Prab/J, Jackson Laboratories] (Schriner et al., 2005) and female C57BL/6NJ (Jackson Laboratories). After the acclimation period, animals were suspended onto the pulley apparatus via orthopedic traction tape as described previously (Wronski and Morey, 1982; Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998, 2002; Kondo et al., 2010). Responses to the social housing HU model also were evaluated in female C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratories), a closely related yet distinct strain. Refer to Supplementary Section for further details on the C57BL/6J study. C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ mice differ in competency for nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) expression (C57BL/6J are deletion mutants) (Freeman et al., 2006). Compared to animals with an intact Nnt gene, C57BL/6J mice have higher rates of H2O2 release, spontaneous oxidation of NADPH, and reduced ability to metabolize peroxide (Ronchi et al., 2013). C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ strains also display differences in metabolic phenotypes of muscle and other organs (Fisher-Wellman et al., 2016). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Experiment design and groups.All animals were supplied with standard rodent laboratory chow (Purina, Cat# 5001) and water ad libitum. We attempted to measure food intake to gain insight into possible differences in body weight responses. However, accurate measurements could not be made since HU animals generated a substantial amount of food pellet fragments (not consumed) that inadvertently fell through the floor grate and could not be recovered. Enrichment consisted of cotton nestlets (Ancare, Cat# NES3600) refreshed daily. The nestlets were split (cut into two equal parts and stripped half of its thickness) to prevent the mice from building ramp-like structures to load the hindlimbs. Cage and bedding changes were performed weekly. Room temperature was maintained within 23–24°C (higher temperatures can be used) with a 12 h light-12 h dark cycle. After 30 days of HU, animals were euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected from vena cava. Soleus, spleen, and adrenal glands were collected and immediately weighed. Tibiae were recovered and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline solution (FD Neurotechnologies) for ∼24 h at 4°C then transferred to 70% ethanol (Sigma) for storage at 4°C until analysis. Unless otherwise stated, sample sizes (C57BL/6NJ) are as follows: Single NL = 8; Single HU = 6; Social NL = 12; and Social HU = 12. To mitigate any technical artifacts from variations in euthanasia times across groups, one animal from each group was euthanized sequentially, and the sequence repeated until all animals have been euthanized for any given day. All dissections were completed within a 7-h period. Social HU Cage Design and Construction The social housing HU system for mice was generated using commercially available rat/guinea pig polycarbonate cages (Ancare, Cat# R20HT) with filter-top lids (Ancare, Cat# R20MBT). Holes were drilled on the walls of each cage to accommodate two food trays as well as the spouts of two water bottles. Food trays consisted of cryovial holders that were cut to fit into the short side wall of the cage (Nalgene, available from Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# 5015-0002). The food tray was attached to each of the two short walls, 5.5 cm above the cage floor. A stainless steel mesh grate (Ancare, Cat# R20SSRWF) was laid out on the cage floor. Bedding was then placed such that it filled two thirds of the space between the cage bottom and the steel mesh grate. In our experience, adding more bedding is not ideal because animals tend to move the bedding to form mounds that come in contact with their hindlimbs. The grid of the ventilated cage lid was sawed out to create an open top. Using a drill, openings were created on one long side of the cage wall to install two spring attachments which were used to secure two water bottles (one for each animal). The spouts of these water bottles were routed into the cage 5.5 cm from the cage floor by drilling openings on the cage wall. Two rods were attached to the cage lids using binder clips to support two pulley systems (one for each animal). The distance that the pulley apparatus can be moved by the animals along the suspended rod was adjusted carefully, using rubber washers to ensure that loading of the hindlimbs do not occur from contact with cage walls or the water sipper (Supplementary Figure S1). In addition, the two suspension rods were placed at an optimal distance from each other so that cephalad regions of the animals can come in contact while avoiding entanglement of the two sets of suspension apparatus (Supplementary Figure S1). To prevent loading of the hindlimbs while being weighed, HU animals were kept suspended on a small hook apparatus set over a lab animal balance as described in Morey-Holton and Globus (2002). Microcomputed Tomography Microarchitecture of the cortical and cancellous compartments of the tibia was quantified by μCT using the SkyScan 1272 system (Bruker). For cancellous bone morphology, the proximal tibia was scanned at 3.5 μm resolution. A 400 μm region of interest was 3D reconstructed with a 450 μm offset from the proximal growth plate. This region was auto-contoured using SkyScan CT Analyzer (CTAn) Software (Bruker) to select for the cancellous region. Cancellous parameters such as Bone Volume (BV, mm3), Tissue Volume (TV, mm3), percent Bone Volume (BV/TV, %), Trabecular Spacing (Tb.Sp, mm), Trabecular Thickness (Tb.Th, mm), and Trabecular Number (Tb.N, 1/mm) were quantified following standard μCT guidelines (Bouxsein et al., 2010). For the analysis of cortical bone microstructure, the tibia was scanned at 12 μm resolution. A 300 μm region that was 200 μm proximal to the tibio-fibular junction (TFJ) was auto-contoured to analyze cortical bone parameters such as Marrow Area (Ma.Ar, mm2), Cortical Area (Ct.Ar, mm2), Endocortical Perimeter (Ec.Pm, mm), Periosteal Perimeter (Ps.Pm, mm), and Cortical Thickness (Ct.Th, mm). Flow Cytometry Analysis of White Blood Cells Flow cytometric analysis of white blood cells (WBC) isolated from C57BL/6NJ was performed, as described previously (Paul et al., 2017). Briefly, peripheral blood was collected and centrifuged at 2000×g for 15 min and plasma removed. Red blood cell lysis buffer at 1X dilution (eBioscience) was added and cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker followed by addition of 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline Solution (PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were then centrifuged at 500×g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet out the WBC, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min on ice, washed, and incubated with Fc block (CD16/32 Block) for 20 min, followed by probing with anti-CD45-FITC, anti-CD4-PE, anti-CD8a-PerCP, anti-CD11b-PECy5, and anti-Ly6G-PE antibodies (all purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Samples were then washed twice in 1X PBS, and acquired using a Guava Flow Cytometer (Millipore). Unstained and single stained compensation controls were used during acquisition and FlowJo software (version 10.3.0) utilized for cytometric analysis. Measurement of Plasma Corticosterone Levels Peripheral blood was collected from the vena cava and introduced into K3 EDTA tubes (Sarstedt, Cat# 41.1395.105). Centrifugation was performed at 2000×g at room temperature for 10 min and plasma collected. Plasma was diluted 1:100 and analyzed using a corticosterone ELISA kit (Abcam, Cat# ab108821) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical Analysis Equivalence of variance was first evaluated by Levene’s test. If the variances were equal, two-way analysis of variance was performed. A Tukey post hoc test was employed when an interaction effect of p < 0.05 was observed. For multi-timepoint measures, repeated measures ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey post hoc test. If the variances were unequal, a two-factor linear model with interaction was employed treating the variance with a logarithmic transformation (Harvey, 1976; Cook and Weisberg, 1983; Aitkin, 1987), with a threshold of p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP software version 13.1.0 (SAS Institute Inc.). Data shown are mean ± standard deviation.",
    "results": "Results To test the hypothesis that social isolation impacts tissue responses to HU, we developed a refinement of the traditional NASA Ames HU cage design that allows paired housing of animals (Figure 2). We then performed a 30-day HU study under these social housing conditions, side-by-side with animals maintained according to the standard NASA single housing HU system (Figure 1). Animals selected for this study were female C57BL/6NJ mice shown previously to be sensitive to bone loss caused by HU (Sankaran et al., 2017). Controls (normally loaded, NL) were age- and sex-matched animals freely ambulating in standard mouse cages. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Side view of (A) single housing HU and (B) social housing HU cage design. To begin to gain insight on whether responses to social housing HU were strain-specific, we also performed a separate 30-day HU experiment in socially housed female C57BL/6J mice (Supplementary Figures S3–S8), another commonly used strain to study musculoskeletal responses to disuse. Due to logistical constraints, this study had a smaller subset of experimental outcomes and only responses of socially housed NL controls and HU groups were evaluated. Body weights were measured at multiple time points during the HU period. In our experience, a modest weight loss (typically <10%) may occur within a week of HU. In C57BL/6NJ mice, there was a modest yet significant decline in body weights at days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 30 in the socially housed HU group compared to its NL control. At any given day of weighing, the magnitude of the difference in mean body weights of the socially housed HU group relative to its NL control was between 3 and 8%. There were no significant differences in body weights in the singly housed HU cohort versus singly housed NL controls at any time point (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S1). We also looked into possible behaviors unique to the NL and HU social housing groups that could contribute to body weight differences. This was done by scoring select time periods in videos taken during the dark and light cycles (Supplementary Methods). Huddling, an adaptation that helps conserve body heat and therefore fat reserves, manifested in socially housed NL controls but not in socially housed HU animals. This was because physical contact between socially housed HU animals can only occur via cephalad regions. In addition, we observed a novel behavior wherein socially housed HU mice pass nestlets (enrichment) to or from their cagemates. Socially housed NL controls did not engage in this behavior (Supplementary Figure S2). In C57BL/6J mice, HU animals and their corresponding NL controls did not differ in body weights at any of the time points (Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S2). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Body weights from day 0 to 30 of hindlimb unloading (HU) and corresponding normally loaded (NL) controls in singly and socially housed female C57BL/6NJ mice. ∗NL social and HU social groups display statistically significant differences at indicated days at p < 0.05 using two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test. Values are expressed as means. For clarity, error bars are omitted. Refer to Supplementary Table S1 for a full list of mean and SD values. Sample sizes: Single NL = 4; Single HU = 6; Social NL = 12; and Social HU = 12. Muscle and bone, conventionally considered mechanosensitive tissues, are profoundly sensitive to unloading. Hence the impact of social isolation on the response of these tissues to HU was examined. The weight of the soleus, a postural muscle known to undergo atrophy in response to spaceflight and unloading (Musacchia et al., 1983; Steffen and Musacchia, 1986; Haida et al., 1989; Desplanches et al., 1990) was measured. Experimental groups had comparable body weights at the onset of the 3-day acclimation period in assigned cages. However, there was a trend (non-significant) for body weight differences (0.8–1.0 g) across groups at the onset of HU. To account for these slight differences, tissue weights were normalized to body weights by dividing tissue weight by the body weight at euthanasia. Use of actual tissue weights did not change the main results or interpretation (Refer to Supplementary Tables S3, S4 for mean and SD of actual tissue weights). In C57BL/6NJ mice, HU led to decrements in normalized soleus weight (Figure 4), whether the mice were housed singly or socially. The magnitudes of muscle atrophy between single and social housing HU cohorts were 44 and 36% respectively. There were no differences in normalized soleus weights between the single and social HU groups. In addition, values for singly and socially housed NL controls were comparable (Figure 4). In C57BL/6J mice, social housing HU also led to the expected decrement in normalized soleus weight (Supplementary Figure S4). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Soleus weights normalized to day 30 body weights of C57BL/6NJ mice. Social envt: Social environment. ∗Statistically significant at p < 0.05 using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test. NS: Not significant. Microcomputed tomography (μCT) analyses were performed to determine the contribution of social isolation to HU-induced deficits in structure of cancellous (Figures 5A–D) and cortical (Figures 6A–E) bone compartments. As expected, in C57BL/6NJ mice HU led to deficits in some cancellous structural parameters, specifically % BV/TV (Figure 5A) and Tb.N (Figure 5D). Tb.Th (Figure 5B) and Tb.Sp (Figure 5C) were unchanged by HU compared to NL controls. HU also led to deficits in some cortical parameters including increased Ma.Ar (Figure 6A) and Ec.Pm (Figure 6E) as well as decreased Ct.Ar (Figure 6B), and Ct.Th (Figure 6C) while Ps.Pm (Figure 6D) was unchanged in HU versus NL controls. Single housing, independent of HU, also led to modest deficits in some cancellous structural parameters including increased Tb.Sp (Figure 5C) and decreased Tb.N (Figure 5D). Further, the type of social environment did not significantly alter the response to HU in any of the cancellous (Figures 5A–D) and cortical (Figures 6A–E) μCT parameters measured, as there were no interaction effects evident by two-way ANOVA. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Microcomputed tomography (μCT) analysis of cancellous compartment of proximal tibiae from C57BL/6NJ mice. (A) % Bone Volume, % BV/TV; (B) Trabecular Thickness, Tb.Th; (C) Trabecular Spacing, Tb.Sp; and (D) Trabecular Number, Tb.N. Two-way ANOVA was performed. NS, not significant. FIGURE 6.

NS, not significant. In C57BL/6J mice, there were no differences between socially housed groups versus NL controls in BV/TV (Supplementary Figure S5A), Tb.Sp (Supplementary Figure S5C), and Tb.N (Supplementary Figure S5D). In contrast, there was a ∼15% decrement in Tb.Th in the HU cohort relative to NL controls (Supplementary Figure S5B). Compared to NL controls, socially housed HU mice displayed a 16% increase in Ma.Ar (Supplementary Figure S6A). There was a modest increase of 9% in Ec.Pm (Supplementary Figure S6E) in socially housed HU mice versus NL controls. These were consistent with the trend seen for the same parameters in C57BL/6NJ mice. Ct. Ar was comparable between NL and HU groups of socially housed C57BL/6J mice (Supplementary Figure S6B) in contrast to the HU-induced deficits (although modest) observed in C57BL/6NJ mice (Figure 6B). Ps.Pm increased by 4% (Supplementary Figure S6D) although its biological relevance is unlikely due to the small magnitude of change. Overall, skeletal responses to HU of socially housed groups in both strains displayed similar trends and recapitulated expected disuse-induced changes in bone structure (Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016). To begin to gain insight into how social isolation during HU may impact the HPA axis, adrenal weights were measured at euthanasia and normalized to body weights (Figure 7) and plasma corticosterone levels were measured at the termination of the study (Figure 8). Adrenal hypertrophy can result from exposure to stressors such as social isolation (Gamallo et al., 1986; Westenbroek et al., 2005; Djordjevic et al., 2012) as well as crowding (Gamallo et al., 1986). In C57BL/6NJ mice, singly housed NL controls showed a 43% increase in normalized adrenal weight compared to socially housed NL controls (Figure 7). Singly and socially housed groups showed differential adrenal responses to HU. Whereas there were no statistically significant differences due to HU in singly housed mice, HU increased normalized adrenal weights by 29% compared to NL controls in socially housed mice. Singly housed HU and socially housed HU groups showed comparable values (Figure 7). In socially housed, C57BL/6J mice, HU did not cause a statistically significant increase in normalized adrenal weights (Supplementary Figure S7), although the trend was consistent with the differences observed in socially housed C57BL/6NJ mice (Figure 7). Plasma corticosterone levels at the termination of the experiment were evaluated in singly and socially housed C57BL/6NJ mice. HU led to increased levels in circulating corticosterone regardless of social environment (Figure 8). FIGURE 7.

NS: Not significant. Sample sizes: Single NL = 5; Single HU = 6; Social NL = 12; and Social HU = 12. FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab Plasma corticosterone levels of C57BL/6NJ mice. Two-way ANOVA with loglinear variance model was applied since unequal variance was observed. NS: Not significant. Sample sizes: Single NL = 8; Single HU = 5; Social NL = 12; and Social HU = 11. Spleen weights and blood cell populations also were examined to assess the contribution of social isolation on aspects of immunity during HU. In both C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ mice, HU led to a reduction in spleen weights (normalized to body weights) compared to NL controls (Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure S8). The type of social environment did not significantly alter splenic weights (Figure 9). To further evaluate immune effects, flow cytometric analyses of peripheral WBCs of C57BL/6NJ mice were performed to calculate the percentage of select leukocyte subpopulations relative to total WBC, using the common leukocyte antigen (CD45) as a general WBC marker (Figures 10A–D). Compared to NL controls, HU under single housing conditions led to a reduction in the percentage of CD4+ cells within CD45+ cells (Figure 10A) while this was not observed in HU under socially housed conditions. CD4+ immunoreactivity marks a subpopulation of T-helper cells. HU did not alter the percentage of CD8+/CD45+cells, a subpopulation of T-cytotoxic cells, in either social environment (Figure 10B). Further, the percentage of CD11b+ cells which broadly marks myeloid cells, including neutrophils and monocytes was increased by HU irrespective of social environment (Figure 10C). Similarly, HU led to an increased percentage of neutrophils marked by Ly6G+CD11b+ immunoreactivity (Figure 10D) regardless of social environment. FIGURE 9.

    "discussion": "Discussion We have developed and validated a refinement to the NASA Ames HU model that accommodates paired housing of animals while retaining desirable features of the original design such as non-invasive attachment of the animal to the suspension harness and range of movement about the cage. An additional functionality to the current design includes individual access to food and water (not accessible to the other animal); thus, studies requiring customization of food or water as treatments can be readily conducted. Another feature of the current design includes the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) materials, which can help achieve significant cost and time savings over the previous standard version (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002). These cage materials are compatible with typical cleaning and sterilization systems found in animal facilities. Finally, the cages occupy a smaller footprint since cage bottoms can be stacked for easy storage and improved transport. Overall, these changes to the design were intended to benefit investigators interested in conducting HU experiments. Other groups have reported the use of paired housing HU systems for mice (Ferreira et al., 2011; Lloyd et al., 2012; Maurel et al., 2016). Similarities between the current design and a previously reported HU system (Ferreira et al., 2011) include the use of COTS components, individual access to food and water and physical contact of cephalad regions of pair housed animals. Notable differences include the manner by which tail attachment to the suspension apparatus is achieved. In the model developed by Ferreira et al. (2011), the tail is secured to the suspension apparatus via piercing of the tail with surgical wire which may prove useful should there be concerns about tail necrosis and/or animals coming down from suspension. In our hands, however, we have not encountered tail necrosis nor accidental release from suspension in our HU studies of short or long duration (up to 30 days) using the tail traction approach. Thus our system has the advantage of avoiding the stress associated with anesthesia and tissue injury from surgical procedures. In addition, the current HU system includes the use of a floor grate and bedding that covers the entirety of the cage floor in contrast to the Ferreira et al. (2011) design where no floor grate was employed and bedding partially covered the cage bottom. The choice of flooring (grate, bedding or bare) can potentially impact experimental results. Hence, variations in flooring across current HU systems is one consideration in experiment design and when comparing across studies. Another difference includes the range of movement about the cage. Our current design retains the pulley apparatus of the standard NASA Ames HU system (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002), which generally allows for ambulation within most of the available cage area (close to half of the total cage area if socially housed). In contrast, the Ferreira et al. (2011) model secures the suspension apparatus via a fixed point which results in a range of movement restricted to a defined radius. Another group has conducted HU in mice housed in pairs although the design of the suspension apparatus prevented physical contact between animals (Lloyd et al., 2012; Krause et al., 2017), in contrast to our current design and the Ferreira et al. (2011) system which both allow cephalad regions of the animals to come in direct contact. Despite the prior existence of other HU designs that accommodate group housing, no other study has systematically assessed the contribution of the social environment in tissue responses to HU, a knowledge gap that we have begun to address here and highlights the novelty of this current study. We validated this alternative social housing HU system by comparing it to the traditional single housing HU model. Standard housing controls were age- and sex-matched animals freely ambulating in standard mouse cages. Alternative controls have been used in other studies, such as restrained animals wherein the tail is attached to the suspension apparatus without elevating hindquarters (no musculoskeletal unloading, orthostatic suspension) (Gaignier et al., 2014; Rettig et al., 2019). One study reports that tail restraint in itself can lead to blood pressure and heart rate changes similar to that observed in singly housed HU rats (Tsvirkun et al., 2012), changes which were not observed in singly housed freely ambulating animals. Another variant to HU experiment design is to house ambulatory controls in HU cages (Huang et al., 2018). We opted for freely ambulating controls in standard vivarium cages. Although the literature is mixed, grate surfaces may alter HPA axis responses to stressors (Freed et al., 2008; Giral et al., 2011), and orthostatic suspension tail restraint, can itself cause stress responses (Tsvirkun et al., 2012). We recognize that selection of a different control group (e.g., restrained mice) may change some of the conclusions drawn from this study. Males were not included in this study and it is well known that some behavioral and physiological responses to social isolation are sexually dimorphic (Caruso et al., 2017; Burke et al., 2018; Matsuda et al., 2018). For example, short-term isolation in female adults increases fear responses, as evaluated by contextual fear memory test, but not in age-matched males (Matsuda et al., 2018). Hence, it possible that some outcomes measured in this study may differ between males and females which can be addressed in future investigations. In C57BL/6NJ mice, singly housed HU and NL controls had comparable body weights throughout the experiment while socially housed HU animals displayed a modest decrease in body weights compared to their corresponding controls. The reason for the persistent difference in body weights in the socially housed groups requires further study (food intake could not be reliably measured). It is possible that behaviors unique to the NL and HU social housing groups may play a role in these differences. Novel behaviors such as nestlet manipulation could have led to an overall increase in activity levels in socially housed HU animals compared to NL controls, and therefore may result in lower body weights of the socially housed HU mice. Unlike C57BL/6NJ mice, socially housed HU and NL control C57BL/6J animals had comparable body weights. These findings from C57BL/6J females are consistent with the report of Ferreira et al. (2011) using the same strain, sex and age at onset of HU (personal communication with Dr. M. Brown). The underlying basis for these observations is not yet understood, although the different metabolic phenotypes of these two strains (Fisher-Wellman et al., 2016) may have contributed to the discrete effects of social housing HU on body weights. In both strains tested (C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ), housing HU mice in social pairs led to the expected decrements in bone microstructural parameters and soleus muscle weights. The magnitudes of musculoskeletal deficits induced by HU between singly and socially housed animals were similar. One interpretation of these findings is that loss of mechanical loading and/or fluid shifts contribute primarily to the osteopenia and sarcopenia caused by the traditional model of simulated weightlessness, while social isolation does not appear to significantly impact these outcomes. However, since HU regardless of social environment led to increases in circulating corticosterone levels, we could not completely rule out the possible contribution of neuroendocrine stress responses (from other sources) to these observed musculoskeletal deficits. Further, direct measures of muscle function (e.g., hindlimb grip strength) and bone mechanical properties (e.g., three point bending of tibia or femur) were not conducted due to logistical constraints. Hence, it remains to be elucidated whether the social environment can differentially impact muscle function and bone strength or whether magnitudes of the deficits (if any) will be similar to bone and muscle outputs in this study. Immune system dysregulation occurs during both short and long duration spaceflight missions (∼6 months) (Crucian et al., 2015, 2018). Spaceflight-induced alterations in immune function include reactivation of herpes viruses (Mehta et al., 2017) as well as changes in the distribution of immune cell populations (Gridley et al., 2009; Morukov et al., 2011). In this study, simulated weightlessness by HU caused a decrement in spleen weight regardless of social environment. Our findings on HU-induced spleen atrophy is consistent with that observed in autoimmune disease (Dillon et al., 1982) and often in spaceflight (Gridley et al., 2003, 2013), while decrements in spleen mass have long been associated with chronically elevated levels of corticosterone and stress (Batuman et al., 1990; Voorhees et al., 2013). Splenectomy compromises the immune system by increasing susceptibility to infections (Sullivan et al., 1978). Compromised immunity in asplenic individuals are primarily seen in reduced Ig class switching and B cell immunity, and although not studied in this report, reduced pre- and pro-B cell populations, along with reduced spleen weight, also have been described in bone loss models (Panaroni et al., 2015). However, it must be noted that other factors apart from immune perturbations could give rise to changes in spleen weight. While the spleen is regarded as a secondary lymphoid organ, it serves additional functions in terms of RBC maintenance and iron storage (Pivkin et al., 2016). Furthermore, the spleen also can accommodate fluid pressure shifts by widening or narrowing internal splenic blood vessels in response to signaling atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) from cardiac myocytes (Kaufman, 1992; Sultanian et al., 2001; Kaufman and Levasseur, 2003), which may serve an important role during microgravity-related fluid pressure shifts. In contrast to our findings in the musculoskeletal system, we observed that some aspects of the immune response to HU can be differentially impacted by the social environment. In C57BL/6NJ mice, HU reduced the percentage of CD4+/CD45+ cells (subpopulation of T-helper cells) compared to NL controls in singly housed mice, but not in socially housed mice. These findings were consistent with other reports of decreased T cell numbers in studies using singly housed mice as well as increased susceptibility to infections in crew members during and after flight (Gridley et al., 2009; Crucian et al., 2015, 2018; Mehta et al., 2017). Differential changes in immune cell populations in HU mice have been reported by others but this was not always observed, with different timepoints of collection likely playing a factor in these outcomes. For example, HU (4 days) increased blood neutrophil counts (Sanzari et al., 2013) while HU (21 days) reduced B cells and decreased T-helper (CD4+)/T-cytotoxic (CD8+) ratio of mouse splenocytes (Gaignier et al., 2014). Others also have reported reduced CD4+ cells in HU (singly housed animals) (Wei et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2007), suggesting disrupted immunity. One important implication of our findings for future spaceflight missions is that facilitating social interactions can potentially mitigate some of the spaceflight-induced immune impairments. In addition, studies report elevation of absolute WBCs and neutrophils in astronauts upon landing (Kaur et al., 2004), along with reduced T cell function during short-term (Stowe et al., 2011) and long-term (Crucian et al., 2015) spaceflight, lasting weeks and months, respectively. HU regardless of social environment increased the percentage of myeloid populations (CD11b+) and a subset within this population, specifically neutrophils (Ly6G+CD11b+). Although there are other possible interpretations, these findings suggest that some immune cell populations (e.g., neutrophils) may be more sensitive to perturbations in gravitational loading and/or fluid shifts than others. Due to logistical limitations, characterization of immune cell populations on C57BL/6J mice was not conducted. Further studies are needed to evaluate strain-dependence of these immune responses. Taken together, our findings indicate that HU and social isolation can both have discrete and interactive effects on the immune system. Our findings also indicate that the social environment can differentially impact some aspects of the HPA axis in response to HU. In C57BL/6NJ mice, singly housed NL controls showed increased adrenal weights compared to socially housed controls consistent with findings of others (Djordjevic et al., 2012). In the present study, there were no differences between singly housed NL control and HU groups, suggesting that HU did not exacerbate any adrenal weight changes incurred by social isolation and vice versa. Adrenal weights were increased in socially housed HU cohorts compared to corresponding NL controls. Taken together, our results are consistent with the possibility that both prolonged simulated weightlessness and social isolation can induce chronic stress (adrenal hypertrophy) although the effects of each factor are not additive. These findings also suggest that social isolation can mask the effects of HU on adrenal hypertrophy. The socially housed animals (NL and HU) in this study had no prior history as cagemates with the exception of one HU pair. To minimize the contribution of stress responses from unfamiliar cagemates and/or a new cage environment, animals were acclimated with their new cagemates for 3 days prior to HU. However, it is conceivable that stress from housing with an unfamiliar individual may have contributed to some of the HPA axis results, although assessment of the values for the pair with a longer history of co-habitation did not show any obvious differences compared to the other 10 socially housed mice. Other studies suggest benefits from less frequent cage and bedding changes which is thought to facilitate the maintenance of environmental olfactory cues thereby minimizing stress. For example pup mortality in C57BL/6J mice was reduced when cage changes were performed every 14 or 21 days instead of every 7 days (Reeb-Whitaker et al., 2001). In our experience, daily changes of nestlets were necessary to minimize soiling and to prevent the buildup of ramp-like structures that may lead to undesirable loading of the hindlimbs in HU animals. Cages and bedding were changed weekly which allows for retention of olfactory cues. There were no significant correlations between body weights and normalized adrenal gland weights nor plasma corticosterone levels (data not shown). Hence, we reason that it is less likely that the observed body weight differences in singly and socially housed C57BL/6NJ HU animals can be attributed solely to HPA axis reactivity. There were no differences in adrenal gland weights in socially housed HU and control C57BL/6J mice in our study, consistent with findings of Ferreira et al. (2011) from pair-housed HU (for 28 days) in females of the same strain and age. Collectively these results indicate that HPA axis responses to HU can be strain-dependent. In this current study, HU regardless of social environment increased circulating corticosterone levels in C57BL/6NJ mice, although there was wide within-group variance. Taken together, our findings suggest that both social isolation and HU in females can lead to responses typically associated with HPA axis activation such as increased adrenal weights and corticosterone levels. The HPA axis interacts with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis (Mastorakos et al., 2006). Investigating the effects of HPA on the HPG axis was outside the scope and hypotheses of this study. However, we recognize that alterations in neuroendocrine signals can have an impact on ovarian function which in turn can drive skeletal changes independent of unloading. Estrogen deficiency (Roggia et al., 2001) and unloading (Shahnazari et al., 2012) each can activate bone remodeling. When combined (e.g., HU or spaceflight ovariectomized animals) (Turner et al., 1998; Keune et al., 2015), unloading caused bone loss greater than that from ovariectomy alone, indicating bone loss is multi-factorial and includes systemic and local inputs. The effects of long duration skeletal unloading on ovarian function is not well understood. In rats, HU tends to reduce estrogen levels and cause prolonged diestrus, changes associated with elevated levels of corticosterone (Tou et al., 2004) together with the expected osteopenia (Tou et al., 2005). Further studies are needed to elucidate the interactions of HPA and HPG axes with musculoskeletal unloading and how it impacts responses to microgravity. Tight regulation of the HPA axis is critical for the maintenance of tissue health, including the immune system (Bellavance and Rivest, 2014). Elevated levels of glucocorticoids resulting from chronic stress, exogenous therapy, or endocrine disorders can lead to immune dysfunction and increased osteoclast activity that contributes to bone loss (Frenkel et al., 2015). Individuals with Cushing’s disease, a neuroendocrine disorder characterized by over-production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and therefore cortisol, display immune impairments, such as decreased CD4+ populations, which we also observed in singly housed HU mice. Neutrophils highly express 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which converts cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone into their respective active forms, cortisol and corticosterone. Neutrophils have been reported to be the main population of immune cells expressing 11β-HSD1 in an inflammation model of peritonitis (Coutinho et al., 2016). Our findings indicate that HU regardless of social environment led to increased percentage of neutrophils and circulating corticosterone levels. We postulate that the increase in neutrophils could have contributed to the elevation in circulating corticosterone levels observed during HU. It is currently unclear whether the HPA axis contributes to the immune changes observed in HU or vice versa. Establishing the direct link between the HPA axis and the observed HU-induced immune changes in singly and socially housed animals needs further study. Percent CD4+ population and adrenal weights are the two outcomes that show differences between singly and socially housed animals. Although comprising a small subset of the outcomes measured in this study, changes in CD4+ population (T-helper) and HPA axis signals can have a profound impact on immunity and other biological processes. Taken together, our findings have important implications for the use of the HU model to simulate exposure to the spaceflight environment. The possible influence of social isolation and HPA axis responses should be taken into account when using and interpreting results obtained from the traditional HU model. In addition, the suitability of these two models in meeting specific experimental objectives needs to be considered. For instance, studies focusing on multiple aspects of the spaceflight environment such as social isolation stress and microgravity, may benefit from employing the traditional single housing HU model. In contrast, investigations that aim to define physiological changes that are gravity-dependent (excluding social isolation stress) may be better conducted using the social housing HU model. In summary, we developed and validated an alternative social housing HU system that retains desirable features of the traditional NASA Ames HU system. We found that deficits in muscle and bone microarchitecture observed in HU mice were fundamentally a response to changes in gravitational loading (i.e., hindquarter disuse and fluid shifts) while components of the immune system and HPA axis were differentially impacted by the social environment during HU. While not in absolute solitude, social confinement is experienced in launch/landing and on-board the ISS and is therefore of high relevance to spaceflight, especially for long duration missions. The availability of both single and social housing HU models can facilitate studies that aim to distinguish the effects of social interactions on the HPA axis and immune system, thereby expanding the utility of the HU model for studying how the spaceflight environment impacts organ systems.",

Copyright notice ID: 6753329 PMID: 31572207 Abstract The hindlimb unloading (HU) model has been used extensively to simulate the cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight with its application expanding to study immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system responses, among others. Most HU studies are performed with singly housed animals, although social isolation also can substantially impact behavior and physiology, and therefore may confound HU experimental results. Other HU variants that allow for paired housing have been developed although no systematic assessment has been made to understand the effects of social isolation on HU outcomes. Hence, we aimed to determine the contribution of social isolation to tissue responses to HU. To accomplish this, we developed a refinement to the traditional NASA Ames single housing HU system to accommodate social housing in pairs, retaining desirable features of the original design. We conducted a 30-day HU experiment with adult, female mice that were either singly or socially housed. HU animals in both single and social housing displayed expected musculoskeletal deficits versus housing matched, normally loaded (NL) controls. However, select immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were differentially impacted by the HU social environment relative to matched NL controls. HU led to a reduction in % CD4+ T cells in singly housed, but not in socially housed mice. Unexpectedly, HU increased adrenal gland mass in socially housed but not singly housed mice, while social isolation increased adrenal gland mass in NL controls. HU also led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels at day 30 in both singly and socially housed mice. Thus, musculoskeletal responses to simulated weightlessness are similar regardless of social environment with a few differences in adrenal and immune responses. Our findings show that combined stressors can mask, not only exacerbate, select responses to HU. These findings further expand the utility of the HU model for studying possible combined effects of spaceflight stressors. Keywords: hindlimb unloading, microgravity model, bone loss, muscle atrophy, immune system, spaceflight, social isolation, HPA axisIntroduction The spaceflight environment poses significant challenges to multiple organ systems. Microgravity exposure leads to a cephalad fluid shift (Foux et al., 1976; Thornton et al., 1987) as well as osteopenia (Lang et al., 2004) and sarcopenia (LeBlanc et al., 2000). Spaceflight alters electrolyte balance (Vorobiev et al., 1995) as well as endocrine (Stowe et al., 2003, 2011), vision (Zhang and Hargens, 2018) and baroreflex processes (Fritsch et al., 1992; Buckey et al., 1996; Meck et al., 2001). Cardiovascular changes include stiffening of the carotid arteries as seen in astronauts returning from a 6-month ISS mission (Hughson et al., 2016) and transient changes in heart rate variability (Yamamoto et al., 2015). Spaceflight also may lead to CNS changes including a decline in cognitive performance (Eddy et al., 1998). Immune system dysregulation also occurs, characterized by altered immune cell function and reactivation of viruses (Crucian et al., 2015, 2018; Mehta et al., 2017). These findings from astronauts are the main motivation to study rodents flown into space with the rationale that rodents are used extensively to model human conditions on Earth and may prove useful for understanding mechanisms and anticipating human responses to spaceflight. However, limited opportunities for rodent spaceflight studies, along with other challenges of conducting microgravity experiments, stimulated interest in using ground-based rodent models of weightlessness. The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model was developed initially to simulate the responses of the musculoskeletal system to microgravity (Wronski and Morey-Holton, 1987; Morey-Holton et al., 2005; Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016). To date, its use has expanded to study the responses of other organ systems to spaceflight, including immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system (Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016). The HU model also is utilized to study disorders on Earth such as osteopenia and sarcopenia because features of the HU model mimic bedrest and disuse. Initial efforts to generate a rodent model for musculoskeletal unloading entailed use of a back harness for inducing a cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse of the hindlimbs in singly housed animals (Morey, 1979), which was then developed further to introduce tail suspension which improved outcomes (Wronski and Morey-Holton, 1987). This system employs non-invasive attachment of the tail via orthopedic traction tape onto a pulley system that allows for elevation of the hindlimbs; application with the custom-designed cage enables free movement of the animal about the cage (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002; Morey-Holton et al., 2005). Since then, other variants of the HU system emerged and include partial unloading of all four limbs using a custom body harness (Wagner et al., 2010; Ellman et al., 2013; Mortreux et al., 2018), various methods to induce unloading such as surgical piercing of the tail, alternative taping methods, simplified cage systems that restrict movement, and group housing (Ferreira et al., 2011; Maurel et al., 2016). Single versus social housing of rodents under standard, ambulatory conditions, can differentially impact multiple organ systems (e.g., cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous system) known also to be affected by spaceflight (Beisel and Talbot, 1987; Schmitt and Schaffar, 1993; D’Aunno et al., 2003; Migeotte et al., 2003; Pierson et al., 2005; Hughson et al., 2016; Mehta et al., 2017). Social isolation causes anxiety and depressive-like behavior (Djordjevic et al., 2012), disrupted circadian rhythms (Spani et al., 2003), deficits in memory (McLean et al., 2010), activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors and impairments in antioxidant responses in the brain (Djordjevic et al., 2015). Social isolation also can stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Jessop and Bayer, 1989; Ros-Simo and Valverde, 2012; Shetty and Sadananda, 2017), the main neuroendocrine regulator of mammalian stress responses (Bellavance and Rivest, 2014). However, other studies report that social isolation can lead to decrements in circulating corticosterone levels (Djordjevic et al., 2012; Ieraci et al., 2016) although it is not clear whether these reflect an initial downregulation of HPA axis activation or simply the induction of a negative feedback loop after a state of activation. In addition, social isolation in rodents leads to impairments in immune function (Jessop and Bayer, 1989; Clausing et al., 1994; Shanks et al., 1994; Wu et al., 2000; Krugel et al., 2014). Social isolation can be a confounding factor for interpreting experimental outcomes from both rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies. In rats, 9 days of spaceflight reduced periosteal bone formation and bone mass (femur dry weights) in singly housed animals but had minimal effect on bone formation or mass in group housed animals (Morey-Holton et al., 2000). In an interesting study, Tsvirkun et al. (2012) report that HU (in standard, single housing) or social isolation (without unloading) each can perturb blood pressure and heart rate levels. The possible contribution of social isolation to the biological outcomes of HU has not been studied, leaving a number of knowledge gaps in our understanding of the model for simulating weightlessness. It is unclear whether social interactions (social versus single housing) during HU differentially impacts organ systems known to be responsive to HU. Rodent experiments on the International Space Station (ISS), particularly those making use of the NASA Rodent Research habitat, are conducted in group housed conditions whereas most HU studies conducted to date entail use of the standard, single housed HU model. Other groups have developed variants of the HU model that accommodate social housing in pairs (Ferreira et al., 2011; Lloyd et al., 2012; Maurel et al., 2016). However, characterization of these models in side-by-side studies with the traditional singly housed HU model have not been conducted. Hence, there is value to further developing and characterizing the socially housed HU model for simulating weightlessness to better match rodent habitat conditions on the ISS. Addressing these gaps in knowledge will lead to an improved understanding of the contribution of isolation to observed responses to HU, which in turn will improve the ability to extrapolate HU results to humans in space. To address these knowledge gaps, we aimed to (1) develop a refinement to the NASA Ames HU system, which traditionally entails housing mice in isolation (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002; Morey-Holton et al., 2005) to enable housing in social pairs and (2) determine the contribution of social isolation to the HU responses of various tissues. We hypothesized that relative to social housing, single housing exacerbates HU-induced dysfunction in select organ systems. To meet these aims and test the hypothesis, we performed a side-by-side comparison of this alternative social HU system versus the standard NASA Ames single housed design and evaluated the responses of select spaceflight-relevant tissues to HU.Materials and Methods Animals and Experiment Design Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition (National Research Council (U.S.) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (U.S.) and National Academies Press (U.S.), 2011). All animal experiments were conducted with prior approval from the NASA Ames Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Sixteen-week old female mice that were to undergo HU were acclimated into HU cages (paired or single housing groups) 3 days prior to the onset of HU (Figure 1). Normally loaded (NL) controls were housed in standard vivarium cages either individually or in pairs. NL controls (either paired or single housing groups) were handled the same way as the HU groups except for the actual attachment of traction tape and tail suspension. Animals were bred at Ames and were wild type littermates of a cross between male mCAT mice [B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-OTC/CAT)4033Prab/J, Jackson Laboratories] (Schriner et al., 2005) and female C57BL/6NJ (Jackson Laboratories). After the acclimation period, animals were suspended onto the pulley apparatus via orthopedic traction tape as described previously (Wronski and Morey, 1982; Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998, 2002; Kondo et al., 2010). Responses to the social housing HU model also were evaluated in female C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratories), a closely related yet distinct strain. Refer to Supplementary Section for further details on the C57BL/6J study. C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ mice differ in competency for nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) expression (C57BL/6J are deletion mutants) (Freeman et al., 2006). Compared to animals with an intact Nnt gene, C57BL/6J mice have higher rates of H2O2 release, spontaneous oxidation of NADPH, and reduced ability to metabolize peroxide (Ronchi et al., 2013). C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ strains also display differences in metabolic phenotypes of muscle and other organs (Fisher-Wellman et al., 2016). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Experiment design and groups.All animals were supplied with standard rodent laboratory chow (Purina, Cat# 5001) and water ad libitum. We attempted to measure food intake to gain insight into possible differences in body weight responses. However, accurate measurements could not be made since HU animals generated a substantial amount of food pellet fragments (not consumed) that inadvertently fell through the floor grate and could not be recovered. Enrichment consisted of cotton nestlets (Ancare, Cat# NES3600) refreshed daily. The nestlets were split (cut into two equal parts and stripped half of its thickness) to prevent the mice from building ramp-like structures to load the hindlimbs. Cage and bedding changes were performed weekly. Room temperature was maintained within 23–24°C (higher temperatures can be used) with a 12 h light-12 h dark cycle. After 30 days of HU, animals were euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected from vena cava. Soleus, spleen, and adrenal glands were collected and immediately weighed. Tibiae were recovered and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline solution (FD Neurotechnologies) for ∼24 h at 4°C then transferred to 70% ethanol (Sigma) for storage at 4°C until analysis. Unless otherwise stated, sample sizes (C57BL/6NJ) are as follows: Single NL = 8; Single HU = 6; Social NL = 12; and Social HU = 12. To mitigate any technical artifacts from variations in euthanasia times across groups, one animal from each group was euthanized sequentially, and the sequence repeated until all animals have been euthanized for any given day. All dissections were completed within a 7-h period.Social HU Cage Design and Construction The social housing HU system for mice was generated using commercially available rat/guinea pig polycarbonate cages (Ancare, Cat# R20HT) with filter-top lids (Ancare, Cat# R20MBT). Holes were drilled on the walls of each cage to accommodate two food trays as well as the spouts of two water bottles. Food trays consisted of cryovial holders that were cut to fit into the short side wall of the cage (Nalgene, available from Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# 5015-0002). The food tray was attached to each of the two short walls, 5.5 cm above the cage floor. A stainless steel mesh grate (Ancare, Cat# R20SSRWF) was laid out on the cage floor. Bedding was then placed such that it filled two thirds of the space between the cage bottom and the steel mesh grate. In our experience, adding more bedding is not ideal because animals tend to move the bedding to form mounds that come in contact with their hindlimbs. The grid of the ventilated cage lid was sawed out to create an open top. Using a drill, openings were created on one long side of the cage wall to install two spring attachments which were used to secure two water bottles (one for each animal). The spouts of these water bottles were routed into the cage 5.5 cm from the cage floor by drilling openings on the cage wall. Two rods were attached to the cage lids using binder clips to support two pulley systems (one for each animal). The distance that the pulley apparatus can be moved by the animals along the suspended rod was adjusted carefully, using rubber washers to ensure that loading of the hindlimbs do not occur from contact with cage walls or the water sipper (Supplementary Figure S1). In addition, the two suspension rods were placed at an optimal distance from each other so that cephalad regions of the animals can come in contact while avoiding entanglement of the two sets of suspension apparatus (Supplementary Figure S1). To prevent loading of the hindlimbs while being weighed, HU animals were kept suspended on a small hook apparatus set over a lab animal balance as described in Morey-Holton and Globus (2002).Microcomputed Tomography Microarchitecture of the cortical and cancellous compartments of the tibia was quantified by μCT using the SkyScan 1272 system (Bruker). For cancellous bone morphology, the proximal tibia was scanned at 3.5 μm resolution. A 400 μm region of interest was 3D reconstructed with a 450 μm offset from the proximal growth plate. This region was auto-contoured using SkyScan CT Analyzer (CTAn) Software (Bruker) to select for the cancellous region. Cancellous parameters such as Bone Volume (BV, mm3), Tissue Volume (TV, mm3), percent Bone Volume (BV/TV, %), Trabecular Spacing (Tb.Sp, mm), Trabecular Thickness (Tb.Th, mm), and Trabecular Number (Tb.N, 1/mm) were quantified following standard μCT guidelines (Bouxsein et al., 2010). For the analysis of cortical bone microstructure, the tibia was scanned at 12 μm resolution. A 300 μm region that was 200 μm proximal to the tibio-fibular junction (TFJ) was auto-contoured to analyze cortical bone parameters such as Marrow Area (Ma.Ar, mm2), Cortical Area (Ct.Ar, mm2), Endocortical Perimeter (Ec.Pm, mm), Periosteal Perimeter (Ps.Pm, mm), and Cortical Thickness (Ct.Th, mm).Flow Cytometry Analysis of White Blood Cells Flow cytometric analysis of white blood cells (WBC) isolated from C57BL/6NJ was performed, as described previously (Paul et al., 2017). Briefly, peripheral blood was collected and centrifuged at 2000×g for 15 min and plasma removed. Red blood cell lysis buffer at 1X dilution (eBioscience) was added and cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker followed by addition of 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline Solution (PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were then centrifuged at 500×g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet out the WBC, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min on ice, washed, and incubated with Fc block (CD16/32 Block) for 20 min, followed by probing with anti-CD45-FITC, anti-CD4-PE, anti-CD8a-PerCP, anti-CD11b-PECy5, and anti-Ly6G-PE antibodies (all purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Samples were then washed twice in 1X PBS, and acquired using a Guava Flow Cytometer (Millipore). Unstained and single stained compensation controls were used during acquisition and FlowJo software (version 10.3.0) utilized for cytometric analysis.Measurement of Plasma Corticosterone Levels Peripheral blood was collected from the vena cava and introduced into K3 EDTA tubes (Sarstedt, Cat# 41.1395.105). Centrifugation was performed at 2000×g at room temperature for 10 min and plasma collected. Plasma was diluted 1:100 and analyzed using a corticosterone ELISA kit (Abcam, Cat# ab108821) according to manufacturer’s instructions.Statistical Analysis Equivalence of variance was first evaluated by Levene’s test. If the variances were equal, two-way analysis of variance was performed. A Tukey post hoc test was employed when an interaction effect of p < 0.05 was observed. For multi-timepoint measures, repeated measures ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey post hoc test. If the variances were unequal, a two-factor linear model with interaction was employed treating the variance with a logarithmic transformation (Harvey, 1976; Cook and Weisberg, 1983; Aitkin, 1987), with a threshold of p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP software version 13.1.0 (SAS Institute Inc.). Data shown are mean ± standard deviation.Results To test the hypothesis that social isolation impacts tissue responses to HU, we developed a refinement of the traditional NASA Ames HU cage design that allows paired housing of animals (Figure 2). We then performed a 30-day HU study under these social housing conditions, side-by-side with animals maintained according to the standard NASA single housing HU system (Figure 1). Animals selected for this study were female C57BL/6NJ mice shown previously to be sensitive to bone loss caused by HU (Sankaran et al., 2017). Controls (normally loaded, NL) were age- and sex-matched animals freely ambulating in standard mouse cages. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Side view of (A) single housing HU and (B) social housing HU cage design.To begin to gain insight on whether responses to social housing HU were strain-specific, we also performed a separate 30-day HU experiment in socially housed female C57BL/6J mice (Supplementary Figures S3–S8), another commonly used strain to study musculoskeletal responses to disuse. Due to logistical constraints, this study had a smaller subset of experimental outcomes and only responses of socially housed NL controls and HU groups were evaluated. Body weights were measured at multiple time points during the HU period. In our experience, a modest weight loss (typically <10%) may occur within a week of HU. In C57BL/6NJ mice, there was a modest yet significant decline in body weights at days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 30 in the socially housed HU group compared to its NL control. At any given day of weighing, the magnitude of the difference in mean body weights of the socially housed HU group relative to its NL control was between 3 and 8%. There were no significant differences in body weights in the singly housed HU cohort versus singly housed NL controls at any time point (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S1). We also looked into possible behaviors unique to the NL and HU social housing groups that could contribute to body weight differences. This was done by scoring select time periods in videos taken during the dark and light cycles (Supplementary Methods). Huddling, an adaptation that helps conserve body heat and therefore fat reserves, manifested in socially housed NL controls but not in socially housed HU animals. This was because physical contact between socially housed HU animals can only occur via cephalad regions. In addition, we observed a novel behavior wherein socially housed HU mice pass nestlets (enrichment) to or from their cagemates. Socially housed NL controls did not engage in this behavior (Supplementary Figure S2). In C57BL/6J mice, HU animals and their corresponding NL controls did not differ in body weights at any of the time points (Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S2). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Body weights from day 0 to 30 of hindlimb unloading (HU) and corresponding normally loaded (NL) controls in singly and socially housed female C57BL/6NJ mice. ∗NL social and HU social groups display statistically significant differences at indicated days at p < 0.05 using two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test. Values are expressed as means. For clarity, error bars are omitted. Refer to Supplementary Table S1 for a full list of mean and SD values. Sample sizes: Single NL = 4; Single HU = 6; Social NL = 12; and Social HU = 12.Muscle and bone, conventionally considered mechanosensitive tissues, are profoundly sensitive to unloading. Hence the impact of social isolation on the response of these tissues to HU was examined. The weight of the soleus, a postural muscle known to undergo atrophy in response to spaceflight and unloading (Musacchia et al., 1983; Steffen and Musacchia, 1986; Haida et al., 1989; Desplanches et al., 1990) was measured. Experimental groups had comparable body weights at the onset of the 3-day acclimation period in assigned cages. However, there was a trend (non-significant) for body weight differences (0.8–1.0 g) across groups at the onset of HU. To account for these slight differences, tissue weights were normalized to body weights by dividing tissue weight by the body weight at euthanasia. Use of actual tissue weights did not change the main results or interpretation (Refer to Supplementary Tables S3, S4 for mean and SD of actual tissue weights). In C57BL/6NJ mice, HU led to decrements in normalized soleus weight (Figure 4), whether the mice were housed singly or socially. The magnitudes of muscle atrophy between single and social housing HU cohorts were 44 and 36% respectively. There were no differences in normalized soleus weights between the single and social HU groups. In addition, values for singly and socially housed NL controls were comparable (Figure 4). In C57BL/6J mice, social housing HU also led to the expected decrement in normalized soleus weight (Supplementary Figure S4). FIGURE 4.

NS: Not significant.Microcomputed tomography (μCT) analyses were performed to determine the contribution of social isolation to HU-induced deficits in structure of cancellous (Figures 5A–D) and cortical (Figures 6A–E) bone compartments. As expected, in C57BL/6NJ mice HU led to deficits in some cancellous structural parameters, specifically % BV/TV (Figure 5A) and Tb.N (Figure 5D). Tb.Th (Figure 5B) and Tb.Sp (Figure 5C) were unchanged by HU compared to NL controls. HU also led to deficits in some cortical parameters including increased Ma.Ar (Figure 6A) and Ec.Pm (Figure 6E) as well as decreased Ct.Ar (Figure 6B), and Ct.Th (Figure 6C) while Ps.Pm (Figure 6D) was unchanged in HU versus NL controls. Single housing, independent of HU, also led to modest deficits in some cancellous structural parameters including increased Tb.Sp (Figure 5C) and decreased Tb.N (Figure 5D). Further, the type of social environment did not significantly alter the response to HU in any of the cancellous (Figures 5A–D) and cortical (Figures 6A–E) μCT parameters measured, as there were no interaction effects evident by two-way ANOVA. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Microcomputed tomography (μCT) analysis of cancellous compartment of proximal tibiae from C57BL/6NJ mice.

NS, not significant.In C57BL/6J mice, there were no differences between socially housed groups versus NL controls in BV/TV (Supplementary Figure S5A), Tb.Sp (Supplementary Figure S5C), and Tb.N (Supplementary Figure S5D). In contrast, there was a ∼15% decrement in Tb.Th in the HU cohort relative to NL controls (Supplementary Figure S5B). Compared to NL controls, socially housed HU mice displayed a 16% increase in Ma.Ar (Supplementary Figure S6A). There was a modest increase of 9% in Ec.Pm (Supplementary Figure S6E) in socially housed HU mice versus NL controls. These were consistent with the trend seen for the same parameters in C57BL/6NJ mice. Ct. Ar was comparable between NL and HU groups of socially housed C57BL/6J mice (Supplementary Figure S6B) in contrast to the HU-induced deficits (although modest) observed in C57BL/6NJ mice (Figure 6B). Ps.Pm increased by 4% (Supplementary Figure S6D) although its biological relevance is unlikely due to the small magnitude of change. Overall, skeletal responses to HU of socially housed groups in both strains displayed similar trends and recapitulated expected disuse-induced changes in bone structure (Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016). To begin to gain insight into how social isolation during HU may impact the HPA axis, adrenal weights were measured at euthanasia and normalized to body weights (Figure 7) and plasma corticosterone levels were measured at the termination of the study (Figure 8). Adrenal hypertrophy can result from exposure to stressors such as social isolation (Gamallo et al., 1986; Westenbroek et al., 2005; Djordjevic et al., 2012) as well as crowding (Gamallo et al., 1986). In C57BL/6NJ mice, singly housed NL controls showed a 43% increase in normalized adrenal weight compared to socially housed NL controls (Figure 7). Singly and socially housed groups showed differential adrenal responses to HU. Whereas there were no statistically significant differences due to HU in singly housed mice, HU increased normalized adrenal weights by 29% compared to NL controls in socially housed mice. Singly housed HU and socially housed HU groups showed comparable values (Figure 7). In socially housed, C57BL/6J mice, HU did not cause a statistically significant increase in normalized adrenal weights (Supplementary Figure S7), although the trend was consistent with the differences observed in socially housed C57BL/6NJ mice (Figure 7). Plasma corticosterone levels at the termination of the experiment were evaluated in singly and socially housed C57BL/6NJ mice. HU led to increased levels in circulating corticosterone regardless of social environment (Figure 8). FIGURE 7.

Two-way ANOVA with loglinear variance model was applied since unequal variance was observed. NS: Not significant. Sample sizes: Single NL = 8; Single HU = 5; Social NL = 12; and Social HU = 11.Spleen weights and blood cell populations also were examined to assess the contribution of social isolation on aspects of immunity during HU. In both C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ mice, HU led to a reduction in spleen weights (normalized to body weights) compared to NL controls (Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure S8). The type of social environment did not significantly alter splenic weights (Figure 9). To further evaluate immune effects, flow cytometric analyses of peripheral WBCs of C57BL/6NJ mice were performed to calculate the percentage of select leukocyte subpopulations relative to total WBC, using the common leukocyte antigen (CD45) as a general WBC marker (Figures 10A–D). Compared to NL controls, HU under single housing conditions led to a reduction in the percentage of CD4+ cells within CD45+ cells (Figure 10A) while this was not observed in HU under socially housed conditions. CD4+ immunoreactivity marks a subpopulation of T-helper cells. HU did not alter the percentage of CD8+/CD45+cells, a subpopulation of T-cytotoxic cells, in either social environment (Figure 10B). Further, the percentage of CD11b+ cells which broadly marks myeloid cells, including neutrophils and monocytes was increased by HU irrespective of social environment (Figure 10C). Similarly, HU led to an increased percentage of neutrophils marked by Ly6G+CD11b+ immunoreactivity (Figure 10D) regardless of social environment. FIGURE 9.

Sample sizes: Single NL = 8; Single HU = 5; Social NL = 12; and Social HU = 12.Discussion We have developed and validated a refinement to the NASA Ames HU model that accommodates paired housing of animals while retaining desirable features of the original design such as non-invasive attachment of the animal to the suspension harness and range of movement about the cage. An additional functionality to the current design includes individual access to food and water (not accessible to the other animal); thus, studies requiring customization of food or water as treatments can be readily conducted. Another feature of the current design includes the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) materials, which can help achieve significant cost and time savings over the previous standard version (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002). These cage materials are compatible with typical cleaning and sterilization systems found in animal facilities. Finally, the cages occupy a smaller footprint since cage bottoms can be stacked for easy storage and improved transport. Overall, these changes to the design were intended to benefit investigators interested in conducting HU experiments. Other groups have reported the use of paired housing HU systems for mice (Ferreira et al., 2011; Lloyd et al., 2012; Maurel et al., 2016). Similarities between the current design and a previously reported HU system (Ferreira et al., 2011) include the use of COTS components, individual access to food and water and physical contact of cephalad regions of pair housed animals. Notable differences include the manner by which tail attachment to the suspension apparatus is achieved. In the model developed by Ferreira et al. (2011), the tail is secured to the suspension apparatus via piercing of the tail with surgical wire which may prove useful should there be concerns about tail necrosis and/or animals coming down from suspension. In our hands, however, we have not encountered tail necrosis nor accidental release from suspension in our HU studies of short or long duration (up to 30 days) using the tail traction approach. Thus our system has the advantage of avoiding the stress associated with anesthesia and tissue injury from surgical procedures. In addition, the current HU system includes the use of a floor grate and bedding that covers the entirety of the cage floor in contrast to the Ferreira et al. (2011) design where no floor grate was employed and bedding partially covered the cage bottom. The choice of flooring (grate, bedding or bare) can potentially impact experimental results. Hence, variations in flooring across current HU systems is one consideration in experiment design and when comparing across studies. Another difference includes the range of movement about the cage. Our current design retains the pulley apparatus of the standard NASA Ames HU system (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002), which generally allows for ambulation within most of the available cage area (close to half of the total cage area if socially housed). In contrast, the Ferreira et al. (2011) model secures the suspension apparatus via a fixed point which results in a range of movement restricted to a defined radius. Another group has conducted HU in mice housed in pairs although the design of the suspension apparatus prevented physical contact between animals (Lloyd et al., 2012; Krause et al., 2017), in contrast to our current design and the Ferreira et al. (2011) system which both allow cephalad regions of the animals to come in direct contact. Despite the prior existence of other HU designs that accommodate group housing, no other study has systematically assessed the contribution of the social environment in tissue responses to HU, a knowledge gap that we have begun to address here and highlights the novelty of this current study. We validated this alternative social housing HU system by comparing it to the traditional single housing HU model. Standard housing controls were age- and sex-matched animals freely ambulating in standard mouse cages. Alternative controls have been used in other studies, such as restrained animals wherein the tail is attached to the suspension apparatus without elevating hindquarters (no musculoskeletal unloading, orthostatic suspension) (Gaignier et al., 2014; Rettig et al., 2019). One study reports that tail restraint in itself can lead to blood pressure and heart rate changes similar to that observed in singly housed HU rats (Tsvirkun et al., 2012), changes which were not observed in singly housed freely ambulating animals. Another variant to HU experiment design is to house ambulatory controls in HU cages (Huang et al., 2018). We opted for freely ambulating controls in standard vivarium cages. Although the literature is mixed, grate surfaces may alter HPA axis responses to stressors (Freed et al., 2008; Giral et al., 2011), and orthostatic suspension tail restraint, can itself cause stress responses (Tsvirkun et al., 2012). We recognize that selection of a different control group (e.g., restrained mice) may change some of the conclusions drawn from this study. Males were not included in this study and it is well known that some behavioral and physiological responses to social isolation are sexually dimorphic (Caruso et al., 2017; Burke et al., 2018; Matsuda et al., 2018). For example, short-term isolation in female adults increases fear responses, as evaluated by contextual fear memory test, but not in age-matched males (Matsuda et al., 2018). Hence, it possible that some outcomes measured in this study may differ between males and females which can be addressed in future investigations. In C57BL/6NJ mice, singly housed HU and NL controls had comparable body weights throughout the experiment while socially housed HU animals displayed a modest decrease in body weights compared to their corresponding controls. The reason for the persistent difference in body weights in the socially housed groups requires further study (food intake could not be reliably measured). It is possible that behaviors unique to the NL and HU social housing groups may play a role in these differences. Novel behaviors such as nestlet manipulation could have led to an overall increase in activity levels in socially housed HU animals compared to NL controls, and therefore may result in lower body weights of the socially housed HU mice. Unlike C57BL/6NJ mice, socially housed HU and NL control C57BL/6J animals had comparable body weights. These findings from C57BL/6J females are consistent with the report of Ferreira et al. (2011) using the same strain, sex and age at onset of HU (personal communication with Dr. M. Brown). The underlying basis for these observations is not yet understood, although the different metabolic phenotypes of these two strains (Fisher-Wellman et al., 2016) may have contributed to the discrete effects of social housing HU on body weights. In both strains tested (C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ), housing HU mice in social pairs led to the expected decrements in bone microstructural parameters and soleus muscle weights. The magnitudes of musculoskeletal deficits induced by HU between singly and socially housed animals were similar. One interpretation of these findings is that loss of mechanical loading and/or fluid shifts contribute primarily to the osteopenia and sarcopenia caused by the traditional model of simulated weightlessness, while social isolation does not appear to significantly impact these outcomes. However, since HU regardless of social environment led to increases in circulating corticosterone levels, we could not completely rule out the possible contribution of neuroendocrine stress responses (from other sources) to these observed musculoskeletal deficits. Further, direct measures of muscle function (e.g., hindlimb grip strength) and bone mechanical properties (e.g., three point bending of tibia or femur) were not conducted due to logistical constraints. Hence, it remains to be elucidated whether the social environment can differentially impact muscle function and bone strength or whether magnitudes of the deficits (if any) will be similar to bone and muscle outputs in this study. Immune system dysregulation occurs during both short and long duration spaceflight missions (∼6 months) (Crucian et al., 2015, 2018). Spaceflight-induced alterations in immune function include reactivation of herpes viruses (Mehta et al., 2017) as well as changes in the distribution of immune cell populations (Gridley et al., 2009; Morukov et al., 2011). In this study, simulated weightlessness by HU caused a decrement in spleen weight regardless of social environment. Our findings on HU-induced spleen atrophy is consistent with that observed in autoimmune disease (Dillon et al., 1982) and often in spaceflight (Gridley et al., 2003, 2013), while decrements in spleen mass have long been associated with chronically elevated levels of corticosterone and stress (Batuman et al., 1990; Voorhees et al., 2013). Splenectomy compromises the immune system by increasing susceptibility to infections (Sullivan et al., 1978). Compromised immunity in asplenic individuals are primarily seen in reduced Ig class switching and B cell immunity, and although not studied in this report, reduced pre- and pro-B cell populations, along with reduced spleen weight, also have been described in bone loss models (Panaroni et al., 2015). However, it must be noted that other factors apart from immune perturbations could give rise to changes in spleen weight. While the spleen is regarded as a secondary lymphoid organ, it serves additional functions in terms of RBC maintenance and iron storage (Pivkin et al., 2016). Furthermore, the spleen also can accommodate fluid pressure shifts by widening or narrowing internal splenic blood vessels in response to signaling atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) from cardiac myocytes (Kaufman, 1992; Sultanian et al., 2001; Kaufman and Levasseur, 2003), which may serve an important role during microgravity-related fluid pressure shifts. In contrast to our findings in the musculoskeletal system, we observed that some aspects of the immune response to HU can be differentially impacted by the social environment. In C57BL/6NJ mice, HU reduced the percentage of CD4+/CD45+ cells (subpopulation of T-helper cells) compared to NL controls in singly housed mice, but not in socially housed mice. These findings were consistent with other reports of decreased T cell numbers in studies using singly housed mice as well as increased susceptibility to infections in crew members during and after flight (Gridley et al., 2009; Crucian et al., 2015, 2018; Mehta et al., 2017). Differential changes in immune cell populations in HU mice have been reported by others but this was not always observed, with different timepoints of collection likely playing a factor in these outcomes. For example, HU (4 days) increased blood neutrophil counts (Sanzari et al., 2013) while HU (21 days) reduced B cells and decreased T-helper (CD4+)/T-cytotoxic (CD8+) ratio of mouse splenocytes (Gaignier et al., 2014). Others also have reported reduced CD4+ cells in HU (singly housed animals) (Wei et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2007), suggesting disrupted immunity. One important implication of our findings for future spaceflight missions is that facilitating social interactions can potentially mitigate some of the spaceflight-induced immune impairments. In addition, studies report elevation of absolute WBCs and neutrophils in astronauts upon landing (Kaur et al., 2004), along with reduced T cell function during short-term (Stowe et al., 2011) and long-term (Crucian et al., 2015) spaceflight, lasting weeks and months, respectively. HU regardless of social environment increased the percentage of myeloid populations (CD11b+) and a subset within this population, specifically neutrophils (Ly6G+CD11b+). Although there are other possible interpretations, these findings suggest that some immune cell populations (e.g., neutrophils) may be more sensitive to perturbations in gravitational loading and/or fluid shifts than others. Due to logistical limitations, characterization of immune cell populations on C57BL/6J mice was not conducted. Further studies are needed to evaluate strain-dependence of these immune responses. Taken together, our findings indicate that HU and social isolation can both have discrete and interactive effects on the immune system. Our findings also indicate that the social environment can differentially impact some aspects of the HPA axis in response to HU. In C57BL/6NJ mice, singly housed NL controls showed increased adrenal weights compared to socially housed controls consistent with findings of others (Djordjevic et al., 2012). In the present study, there were no differences between singly housed NL control and HU groups, suggesting that HU did not exacerbate any adrenal weight changes incurred by social isolation and vice versa. Adrenal weights were increased in socially housed HU cohorts compared to corresponding NL controls. Taken together, our results are consistent with the possibility that both prolonged simulated weightlessness and social isolation can induce chronic stress (adrenal hypertrophy) although the effects of each factor are not additive. These findings also suggest that social isolation can mask the effects of HU on adrenal hypertrophy. The socially housed animals (NL and HU) in this study had no prior history as cagemates with the exception of one HU pair. To minimize the contribution of stress responses from unfamiliar cagemates and/or a new cage environment, animals were acclimated with their new cagemates for 3 days prior to HU. However, it is conceivable that stress from housing with an unfamiliar individual may have contributed to some of the HPA axis results, although assessment of the values for the pair with a longer history of co-habitation did not show any obvious differences compared to the other 10 socially housed mice. Other studies suggest benefits from less frequent cage and bedding changes which is thought to facilitate the maintenance of environmental olfactory cues thereby minimizing stress. For example pup mortality in C57BL/6J mice was reduced when cage changes were performed every 14 or 21 days instead of every 7 days (Reeb-Whitaker et al., 2001). In our experience, daily changes of nestlets were necessary to minimize soiling and to prevent the buildup of ramp-like structures that may lead to undesirable loading of the hindlimbs in HU animals. Cages and bedding were changed weekly which allows for retention of olfactory cues. There were no significant correlations between body weights and normalized adrenal gland weights nor plasma corticosterone levels (data not shown). Hence, we reason that it is less likely that the observed body weight differences in singly and socially housed C57BL/6NJ HU animals can be attributed solely to HPA axis reactivity. There were no differences in adrenal gland weights in socially housed HU and control C57BL/6J mice in our study, consistent with findings of Ferreira et al. (2011) from pair-housed HU (for 28 days) in females of the same strain and age. Collectively these results indicate that HPA axis responses to HU can be strain-dependent. In this current study, HU regardless of social environment increased circulating corticosterone levels in C57BL/6NJ mice, although there was wide within-group variance. Taken together, our findings suggest that both social isolation and HU in females can lead to responses typically associated with HPA axis activation such as increased adrenal weights and corticosterone levels. The HPA axis interacts with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis (Mastorakos et al., 2006). Investigating the effects of HPA on the HPG axis was outside the scope and hypotheses of this study. However, we recognize that alterations in neuroendocrine signals can have an impact on ovarian function which in turn can drive skeletal changes independent of unloading. Estrogen deficiency (Roggia et al., 2001) and unloading (Shahnazari et al., 2012) each can activate bone remodeling. When combined (e.g., HU or spaceflight ovariectomized animals) (Turner et al., 1998; Keune et al., 2015), unloading caused bone loss greater than that from ovariectomy alone, indicating bone loss is multi-factorial and includes systemic and local inputs. The effects of long duration skeletal unloading on ovarian function is not well understood. In rats, HU tends to reduce estrogen levels and cause prolonged diestrus, changes associated with elevated levels of corticosterone (Tou et al., 2004) together with the expected osteopenia (Tou et al., 2005). Further studies are needed to elucidate the interactions of HPA and HPG axes with musculoskeletal unloading and how it impacts responses to microgravity. Tight regulation of the HPA axis is critical for the maintenance of tissue health, including the immune system (Bellavance and Rivest, 2014). Elevated levels of glucocorticoids resulting from chronic stress, exogenous therapy, or endocrine disorders can lead to immune dysfunction and increased osteoclast activity that contributes to bone loss (Frenkel et al., 2015). Individuals with Cushing’s disease, a neuroendocrine disorder characterized by over-production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and therefore cortisol, display immune impairments, such as decreased CD4+ populations, which we also observed in singly housed HU mice. Neutrophils highly express 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which converts cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone into their respective active forms, cortisol and corticosterone. Neutrophils have been reported to be the main population of immune cells expressing 11β-HSD1 in an inflammation model of peritonitis (Coutinho et al., 2016). Our findings indicate that HU regardless of social environment led to increased percentage of neutrophils and circulating corticosterone levels. We postulate that the increase in neutrophils could have contributed to the elevation in circulating corticosterone levels observed during HU. It is currently unclear whether the HPA axis contributes to the immune changes observed in HU or vice versa. Establishing the direct link between the HPA axis and the observed HU-induced immune changes in singly and socially housed animals needs further study. Percent CD4+ population and adrenal weights are the two outcomes that show differences between singly and socially housed animals. Although comprising a small subset of the outcomes measured in this study, changes in CD4+ population (T-helper) and HPA axis signals can have a profound impact on immunity and other biological processes. Taken together, our findings have important implications for the use of the HU model to simulate exposure to the spaceflight environment. The possible influence of social isolation and HPA axis responses should be taken into account when using and interpreting results obtained from the traditional HU model. In addition, the suitability of these two models in meeting specific experimental objectives needs to be considered. For instance, studies focusing on multiple aspects of the spaceflight environment such as social isolation stress and microgravity, may benefit from employing the traditional single housing HU model. In contrast, investigations that aim to define physiological changes that are gravity-dependent (excluding social isolation stress) may be better conducted using the social housing HU model. In summary, we developed and validated an alternative social housing HU system that retains desirable features of the traditional NASA Ames HU system. We found that deficits in muscle and bone microarchitecture observed in HU mice were fundamentally a response to changes in gravitational loading (i.e., hindquarter disuse and fluid shifts) while components of the immune system and HPA axis were differentially impacted by the social environment during HU. While not in absolute solitude, social confinement is experienced in launch/landing and on-board the ISS and is therefore of high relevance to spaceflight, especially for long duration missions. The availability of both single and social housing HU models can facilitate studies that aim to distinguish the effects of social interactions on the HPA axis and immune system, thereby expanding the utility of the HU model for studying how the spaceflight environment impacts organ systems.Data Availability All datasets generated for this study are included in the manuscript and/or the Supplementary Files.Ethics Statement Animals experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition (National Research Council (U.S.) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (U.S.) and National Academies Press (U.S.), 2011).

    "abstract": "Abstract Animal models are useful for exploring the health consequences of prolonged spaceflight. Capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth orbit with on-board sample recovery, thereby avoiding complications caused by return to Earth. For NASA’s Rodent Research-1 mission, female mice (ten 32 wk C57BL/6NTac; ten 16 wk C57BL/6J) were launched on an unmanned vehicle, then resided on the International Space Station for 21/22d or 37d in microgravity. Mice were euthanized on-orbit, livers and spleens dissected, and remaining tissues frozen in situ for later analyses. Mice appeared healthy by daily video health checks and body, adrenal, and spleen weights of 37d-flight (FLT) mice did not differ from ground controls housed in flight hardware (GC), while thymus weights were 35% greater in FLT than GC. Mice exposed to 37d of spaceflight displayed elevated liver mass (33%) and select enzyme activities compared to GC, whereas 21/22d-FLT mice did not. FLT mice appeared more physically active than respective GC while soleus muscle showed expected atrophy. RNA and enzyme activity levels in tissues recovered on-orbit were of acceptable quality. Thus, this system establishes a new capability for conducting long-duration experiments in space, enables sample recovery on-orbit, and avoids triggering standard indices of chronic stress.

    "introduction": "Introduction Space travel over the past five decades reveals that multiple organ systems are influenced by novel environmental conditions above the Earth’s surface. In addition to reduced gravitational acceleration, spaceflight confers other unique environmental challenges including confinement in a closed environment, altered gas composition and exposure to space radiation, each of which has the potential to have physiological effects. Protecting humans in space requires a clear understanding of the myriad of physiologic changes that can occur in response to these exposures and their associated medical risks. As on Earth, experimentation with rodents in space enables detailed exploration of physiology and mechanisms, as well as potential mitigation strategies using experimental approaches that are not possible with humans as subjects. All but two spaceflight rodent experiments, prior to the Rodent Research (RR)-1 mission described here, have entailed sample collection only after return to Earth. In fact, some of the observed consequences of spaceflight on tissue structure1 and gene expression2 can be attributed to forces related to return and ambulation on Earth prior to sample recovery, rather than to habitation in space per se. Therefore, there is a pressing need for spaceflight hardware and operational systems to further explore the consequences of long duration space travel on rodents, while avoiding the confounding variables introduced by reentry and return of the animals to Earth. Previous Russian Cosmos and NASA Space Shuttle missions provided multiple opportunities to perform rodent experiments up to three weeks in duration, which contributed to our current understanding of how mammals adapt to the space environment. Rodent Space Shuttle experiments conducted between 1965 and 2011 demonstrated extensive changes in the immune, musculoskeletal, and central nervous and cardiovascular systems, as well as endocrine, hematologic and metabolic changes3, although results between missions were sometimes inconsistent. Various independent variables such as strain, age, and duration may account for at least some of the mixed results obtained between different experiments; however, the relatively short duration of all Shuttle missions is likely to be a major factor explaining the discrepancies. Tissues adapt dynamically and at different rates to the allostatic load imposed in the course of a prolonged spaceflight experiment, which entails introduction into a novel flight hardware caging environment, launch, habitation in microgravity, then typically reentry and ambulation on Earth prior to sample recovery. There also have been a limited number of long duration (>3 wk), rodent spaceflight experiments. A recent unmanned, Russian biosatellite experiment (Bion M1) that entailed sample recovery after return to Earth revealed that 30 days of spaceflight caused muscle, thymus and spleen atrophy (4,5 deficits in structure of various skeletal elements (6,7), altered structural morphology and changes in gene expression of several tissues5,8. The lengthy interval (13 hr) between capsule reentry and sample recovery for the Bion M1 mission may have affected at least some of these findings. The longest duration experiment with rodents in space completed to date (91d) in the European Space Agency’s Mouse Drawer System9 revealed intriguing differences in oxidative damage to red blood cells10 and skeletal decrements11, although this experiment had a limited sample size. Recently, the Japanese Space Agency performed important experiments with a newly developed flight hardware system supporting singly-housed mice, which can be centrifuged at 1 g to replace Earth’s gravity level while on the ISS12. Findings from their experiments reveal that 1 g artificial gravity mitigates the expected bone loss and muscle atrophy12 as well as retinal changes13 that occur after long duration microgravity. Each of the various flight hardware systems developed for long duration spaceflight has unique features, which have the potential to influence results obtained (Table 1). Table 1.

The main goal of RR-1 was to establish new capabilities for conducting reliable and reproducible long duration experiments using rodents with on-orbit sample collection. Important objectives included monitoring animal health and welfare, and recovering samples of sufficiently high quality for global gene expression analysis using current demanding methods. The RR-1 flight experiment consisted of two separate studies with a total of 20 mice; one NASA Validation study (10 mice) and one ISS National Lab Experimental study (10 mice). The NASA Validation study was designed to evaluate the capaibilities of the rodent hardware, on-orbit operations, and sample retrieval for conducting high quality rodent expeirments consistent with current standards. The Experimental study was sponsored by the ISS National Lab on behalf of Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, and was designed to determine spaceflight effects on muscle atrophy in MuRF1 knockout (KO) mice and wild type (WT) mice14–16. Results from both studies contributed to the findings described in this paper. The Rodent Habitat differs from other long duration spaceflight housing systems12,17 in that it provides for both group-housing and internal wire grating that enable grabbing and purposeful locomotion throughout the cage, much like human crew do throughout the cabin. To accommodate unique aspects of the Dragon transport vehicle and the ISS, flight hardware was modified from the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), that was used successfully in 27 missions with rats or mice aboard the Space Shuttle3 followed by multiple RR missions14,18–25. The RR-1 validation mission launched adult, female mice to low earth orbit in an unmanned Dragon capsule on SpaceX-4, then after 4 days the RR-1 mice were transferred to the International Space Station (ISS) where they resided for up to 33 days (total 37 days in microgravity). Female mice were selected for this mission for two reasons: first, because only female mice were flown on earlier missions that used the heritage AEM group-housed hardware system, and second, to avoid potential complications due to aggression which is more common in males than females. After this first Validation mission, pre-flight experiments were performed to optimize conditions for acclimating males in group-housed conditions22, and subsequently flight experiments were conducted successfully with males19. Important aspects of the study design included use of adult animals, a cage system that enabled purposeful locomotion of the animals throughout the habitat, and measurements of basic indices of animal health that were compromised in past spaceflight experiments. Animal health and behavior were monitored by daily downlinked video, and samples were dissected both on-orbit by astronauts and after return to Earth from frozen carcasses. Subsequently, tissue samples were distributed to multiple scientists across the world for detailed analyses. We found mice thrived in the housing, as assessed by behavior, body weights and organ mass (adrenal, thymus, spleen). Further, samples dissected on-orbit yielded high quality RNA and protein (select liver enzyme activities). Recovery of livers dissected from frozen carcasses yielded RNA with high RIN values, although further work is needed to determine conclusively if transcriptional profiles are the same in livers freshly dissected on orbit compared to livers recovered post-flight from frozen carcasses.",
    "methods": "Methods Hardware description and performance The Rodent Research Transporter and Habitats performed as expected for the duration of the flight. There were no interruptions in power, lighting, airflow, or the delivery of food and water throughout the duration of the mission. Lights were programmed on a 12:12 hr light/dark cycle (6:00–18:00 GMT, lights on) and enough food and water was provided so that replenishment was not required for the duration of this mission. Temperature, humidity and gas levels varied within the compartments of the Transporter and Habitat along with the ISS cabin environment due to active air exchanges between the ISS cabin and inside the Habitat (~ 0.3 m/s). In the U.S. Lab portion of the ISS where habitats were located, CO2 ranged from 788–4690 ppm, temperature from 21.3–24.1 °C, and humidity from 32–58% during the in-flight phase of the experiment (Sept 25 – Oct 31, 2014). Within the Habitat, sensor readings ranged from 26.3–28 C for Experimental Flight Habitats and 27.0–27.9 C for Experimental GC Habitats. The average temperatures were 26.0 °C and 26.4 °C for Experimental Flight and GC Habitats, respectively. The Validation and Experimental Habitats on the ISS were located in different racks that housed and powered the hardware (EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments for Space Station (EXPRESS) racks). The Validation Habitat was consistently observed to be 0.6–2.3 °C warmer than the Experimental Habitat due to differences in the local air temperature in front of the EXPRESS racks. Nonetheless, all parameters fell within the requirements for animal welfare that were set prior to the mission. The Validation and Experimental GC mice were housed in Habitats that were placed in an ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ISSES chambers were programmed on a 4-day delay using telemetry data from ISS to closely match the temperature, humidity, and CO2 partial pressure in the FLT Habitats to ensure that the GC animals on Earth were exposed to the same environmental parameters as the flight animals on-orbit, while the Validation Viv mice were housed continuously in a standard animal facility at KSC. Transporter (Supplementary Fig. S4A): The Transporter provides for the transport of rodents on the commercial resupply service vehicle (SpaceX Dragon for this mission), both to and from the ISS. The Transporter was tested pre-flight in a series of ground-based experiments and shown to successfully house and provide life support for 20 mice (10 mice per side), which is twice the density compared to the Habitats, for up to 10 days during the ascent to the ISS or during the descent back to Earth. During transport, the Transporters were connected to the life support system provided by the Dragon vehicle. During transportation to the ISS, the animals could not be viewed or checked until they were transferred from the Transporter to the Habitats on-board the ISS by crewmembers. External sensors attached to the Transporter and Dragon recorded the environmental data during transport to and from the ISS. Habitat: The rodent Habitat was modified from heritage flight hardware (AEM) to provide long-term housing for rodents aboard the ISS (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Differences between the AEM, developed and used for short-term Space Shuttle missions, and the Habitat include long duration and secondary exhaust filters, water refill capability, and the addition of four video cameras (Supercircuits, Austin, TX) to monitor daily activity and animals’ health and behavior. Two color cameras with wide angle lens and two black and white cameras with pinhole lens are located in the filter and lixit areas, respectively. A brief description of the different types of animal flight hardware to date is described in Table 1. Foodbars (~850 g) developed specifically for the flight hardware54 were mounted onto a metal plate (two plates per Habitat, one plate per side) and approximately 2 liters of deionized autoclaved water supplemented with 4 ppm iodine (to prevent microbial growth) were installed into each Habitat. Water bags were filled and installed in the Habitats at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) before Habitats were launched to ISS without animals. Once on-orbit, the crew members connected the Habitats to power source, installed them in EXPRESS Racks and ran a verification to ensure that telemetry (temperature, CO2, %RH), video downlink from cameras, lights, and fans are functional prior to animal transfer. Food bar plates were inserted in the Habitats prior to animal transfer on-orbit. Additionally, the Habitat allows for water refills on-orbit to support long-duration missions of more than 30 days (although water was not refilled during the mission described here). Videos recorded from the Habitat cameras were used to assess animal health and behavior including sleeping, eating, drinking, grooming, and ambulating. The Habitat also contained sensors to detect humidity and temperature. For this mission, no additional form of enrichment was provided to the animals. Animal Access Unit (AAU, Supplementary Fig. S4C): This unit attaches to both the Transporter and Habitat to safely access the animals during transfer between the two and for science operations, preventing escape of animal waste into the cabin environment. Mouse Transfer Box (MTB, Supplementary Fig. S4D): A lexan box with a 2-door lid was created to hold and securely transfer up to 5 animals at a time between the Transporter and Habitat, and Habitat and Microgravity Science Glovebox, which is an experimental hood located on the ISS, that was used to euthanize the animals and dissect their tissues on-orbit. Pre-flight testing of rodent research hardware Although the AEM has been successfully flown 27 times on the US Space Shuttles over the past 50 years, the Rodent Habitat has been developed by adding multiple new features as described above. Therefore, a series of ground-based tests were performed using a protocol similar to those for spaceflight (with the exception of the microgravity factor) to ensure that the Habitat could support a long-duration mission on the ISS. Launch simulation test A Launch Simulation Test (LST) was conducted to determine if the Transporter would maintain the health and well-being of mice when subjected to the SpaceX Dragon launch profile (random vibration and steady state acceleration). To do this, female C57BL/6J (14 weeks old) mice from Jackson Lab were subjected to vibration followed by centrifugation while in the Transporter to simulate the launch profile of the Dragon. For the LST the mice first were housed in the Transporter at a density of 20 mice per Transporter (10 mice per side) for 10 days to simulate the longest expected time of the transient phase between animal loading prior to launch and animal transfer on the ISS to the Habitats. At the end of the LST the mice were checked by the attending veterinarian and deemed to be healthy and suitable for experimental research. The LST was followed by a biocompatibility test in which the mice were housed in the Habitats for 32 days, similar to what was described previously for a group of young, male mice subjected to segmented bone defects55. For this study, a subset of mice were subject to hindlimb unloading (HU)56 immediately after the launch simulation test to evaluate any adverse health effects on the mice due to the sequential stressors of launch simulation and weightlessness in simulated microgravity.Rodent habitat biocompatibility test Two separate biocompatibility tests of different duration (e.g. 32 and 91 days) were performed with the Habitats to determine the length of time the Habitat can support animal health. The following was evaluated throughout the test: stability of the fans, cameras, and telemetry sensors, performance and saturation of the filters, waste buildup, and most importantly, long-term animal health and well-being. The data showed that the Habitat supported 10 female, 16 wk old C57BL/6J female mice for 32 days during the first test; there were no significant differences in body weights nor the weights of the organs that are known to respond to chronic stress (e.g. adrenal glands, thymus, and spleen) between the animals housed in standard vivarium cages and those housed in Rodent Habitats. The animals were checked by the NASA Attending Veterinarian and deemed to be healthy and suitable for science. This test was conducted using the same protocol as the RR-1 experiment described here, including the animal acclimation and daily health checks. To assess if the Habitat can support the animals’ health and well-being for as long as 3 months, a biocompatibility test was conducted for 91 days, comparing mice housed in the Habitat continuously to mice housed in standard, shoebox cages (i.e. vivarium). The test revealed that the hardware performed as expected to support animal health (data not shown). Preflight preparation and transit to ISS Pre-flight training of astronaut crew Two United States Orbital Segment (USOS) crew members were trained by certified trainers in the 2-day Rodent Generic Skills class at Johnson Space Center (JSC), where they practiced and were certified for animal handling and gross dissection skills with multiple animals. The crewmembers also were trained in animal handling, euthanasia, and mission specific dissection skills using flight-like kits for tissue preservation and the Rodent Research hardware. They also received training on how to conduct a health assessment of the animals. The first priority of the training was to ensure humane animal handling and euthanasia.Animals All animal procedures performed in these experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for flight at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and the methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Twelve-week old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Wild type C57BL/6NTac mice and MuRF1 (muscle RING finger protein 1) knockout (KO) mice that were generated on C57BL/6NTac background were purchased from Taconic Biosciences (Rensselaer, NY) for the Experimental cohorts, respectively. All the mice were implanted with IMI-1000 2 × 11 mm transponders (Biomedic Data Systems, Seaford, DE) prior to shipping, and were examined by the animal care facility (ACF) veterinarian staff upon arrival at KSC. Fecal samples were collected at 2 different time points: upon receipt at KSC and 11 days before turnover for launch, analyzed by Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) to verify that they are free from microorganisms before launch. The mice were housed in standard vivarium cages at a density of 5 mice per cage. The animals were provided with standard bedding, diet (LabDiet Rodent 5001), and deionized autoclaved water ad libitum, maintained on a 12 hr:12 hr dark/light cycle (6:00–18:00 GMT, lights on), and checked daily by the KSC and ARC staff. During the pre-flight period, body weight, food depletion, and water consumption data were collected and recorded twice a week. Animal identification and body weight measurements were collected and recorded using the Data Acquisition System (DAS-8001) and Smart Probe (SP-6004) (Bio Medic Data Systems) in conjunction with the top-loading balance (AC3102CU, OHAUS).Animal pre-flight acclimation, group assignment, and flight preparation Four days after arriving at KSC, the Validation animals were gradually acclimated to the foodbars and hardware. Twenty-two days before launch (L-22d), the mice were introduced to the NASA Type 12 Nutrient upgraded rodent foodbars (NuRFB)54, and at L-18d to deionized, autoclaved water via water bottles outfitted with lixits. At L-12d the mice were introduced to raised wire floors and regrouped based on their body weights, and placed at double density (10 mice per cage). Mouse Igloos (VWR, Radnor, PA) were provided to the mice for enrichment. Food and water depletion was measured, via weight changes, every 3–4 days after mice were placed at double density. Note that since foodbars crumble and fall through the wire cage grid walls during consumption, their measured weights do not accurately reflect total consumption. Similarly, Experimental mice were received at KSC at L-10 weeks (and not provided igloos as enrichment), placed on lixits, food bars and raised wire floors at L-23 days, and combined to double density at L-12 days. Loading and turnover was L-2 days.Animal selection At L-6d, three cages of the Validation mice (10 mice per cage) were selected based on similar body weights to be the Spaceflight (FLT), Ground control (GC), and Vivarium control (Viv) groups for the Validation experiment. The animals were examined by the attending veterinarian and were deemed to be healthy and suitable for the flight experiment. Experimental mice were similarly weight matched into Basal, FLT and GC groups and assessed by the AV. From these 3 groups, at L-3d, the FLT group animals were assigned based on their health and body weights. At L-2d, the FLT mice (16 weeks and 32 weeks of age for Validation and Experimental groups, respectively) were loaded into the Transporter and turned over to SpaceX for launch. The animal loading was originally scheduled to occur at L-25 hours, but due to a launch slip of ~24 hours, the mice were housed for 2 days in the Transporter prior to launch. During this time, the Transporter remained in the Dragon capsule on the launch pad.Animal load and turnover for launch The Transporters containing the FLT mice were driven to the launch pad in a temperature controlled van then turned over to SpaceX to be installed in the Dragon capsule for launch. Between turnover and loading into the SpaceX Dragon Capsule, the Transporters were connected to a power supply and kept in an air-conditioned van or room in a SpaceX facility. Data collected from sensors attached to the outside of the transporter confirmed that temperature and humidity remained within acceptable range. Once the Transporters were installed and Dragon capsule hatch closed, life support and environmental control was provided by the SpaceX Dragon. Due to a one day launch delay, the animals remained in the Transporters for two days prior to launch. To prepare for launch, the Dragon capsule atop the Falcon9 rocket transitioned from horizontal to vertical position. This rotation was replicated on the ground control Transporters. Dragon is unmanned and there is no video capability in the Transporter. As such, there were no health checks performed while animals were in the Transporter during ascent. The Dragon environmental control and life support system maintained the atmosphere within acceptable limits for pressure, temperature (65–85°F), relative humidity (25–75%), oxygen (19–23%), and carbon dioxide (≤6000 ppm). Later analysis of sensors installed in Dragon cabin confirmed that environmental conditions remained within allowable ranges.On-orbit animal operations Four days after launch (L + 4d), mice were transferred by astronauts from the Transporter to the Habitats on the ISS. As the animals were being transferred, the crew and the Attending Veterinarian (via real-time telemetry from an over-the-shoulder camera) examined the animals. All mice were deemed healthy, and they were housed at a density of 10 mice per Habitat, 5 mice per side. While on-board the ISS, animal health checks were performed daily as described below. Of the 10 Experimental mice, results from only 5 WT are reported here; muscle responses for all the Experimental mice are reported by Cadena et al.14. Experimental mice were processed on the 17th (L + 21d, 5 mice) and 18th (L + 22d, 5 mice) days after animal transfer on the ISS. On these days, the mice were removed from their Habitats and brought to the MSG for handling and dissection using ventilated Mouse Transfer Boxes (MTB, Supplementary Fig. S4D). The animals were subsequently euthanized via intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Euthasol (Virbac, Fort Worth, TX) diluted with sterile saline (1:1) at 1.72 mg/kg followed by cervical dislocation then processed in the MSG on-orbit. The right hindlimb was dissected from 10 mice. The liver and spleen were collected from 5 wild-type mice and frozen at ≤−80 °C in a flight freezer (the Minus Eighty degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS, MELFI) or preserved in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 4 °C for 2 days then frozen and stored at ≤−80 °C, respectively. On the 33rd day after the animals were transferred to Habitats on the ISS (37 days after launch), 10 Validation mice were euthanized via IP injection of Euthasol (1.72 mg/kg) followed by cervical dislocation then processed in the MSG. Two of the 10 mice were dissected immediately after euthanasia to recover livers and spleens on the ISS. Livers were then stored at ≤−80 °C in the (≤−80 °C) Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer (MELFI). Spleens were dissected and preserved in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 4 °C for about 2 days and then transferred to the MELFI for freezing and storage until return to Earth. The remaining 8 non-dissected Validation mice carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, put in Ziploc bags and stored in the MELFI (≤−80 °C). Livers and carcasses were placed in cold stowage containers that were prechilled to −130 °C to freeze the livers and carcasses in the MSG prior to transfer and storage in the MELFI. Since only 2 of the 10 Validation mice were dissected for livers and spleens on the ISS due to crew time constraints, the liver and spleen samples dissected from 5 wild-type ISS National Lab Experimental mice were provided to NASA for post-flight analysis to increase the sample size (Fig. 2B). The Flight Attending Veterinarian was in attendance for all on-orbit euthanasia and dissection procedures and was able to visualize and communicate with the crew via real-time video and voice loop. Each individual animal was examined and noted to be in good condition prior to euthanasia. The dissection procedures were successfully completed on all mice.Baseline controls (Basal) For both the Experimental and Validation studies, 10 baseline mice matched by pre-launch body weights to Viv, FLT and GC were housed in standard mouse cages, 5 mice per shoebox cage (11.5″ × 7.5″″ × 5″, catalog 100272 F, Lab Products, Seaford, DE) with one Igloo per cage for enrichment and maintained in an animal holding room at the KSC ACF. The mice were euthanized and processed one day after launch according to the same protocol as their respective FLT mice.Ground controls (GCs) Mice selected for GCs were housed in the Rodent hardware (Transporter and Habitats) and treated as similarly as possible to FLT animals. All procedures were off-set by a 4-day delayed schedule so that environments could be set to match telemetry data received from the ISS. Thus, GC mice were loaded into the Transporter at L + 1d. Just prior to animal loading, the mice were checked by the KSC Attending Veterinarian, and they were deemed healthy and suitable for science. The Transporter was kept in the ISSES to simulate the same environmental conditions the FLT animals were exposed to. After 4 days inside the Transporter, the Validation and Experimental GC mice were evaluated by the KSC ACF veterinarian staff and then transferred to the Habitats, where they were housed at a density of 10 mice per Habitat, 5 mice per side. The Habitats, containing the Experimental and Validation GC mice, were maintained in the ISSES for 17–18 and 33 days, respectively, under the same environmental conditions as the FLT mice. The Experimental and Validation GC mice were dissected and processed using the same timelines (off-set by 4 days) and protocols as their respective FLT mice.Vivarium controls (Viv) The Validation mice selected for the Viv group were housed in standard mouse cages, 5 mice per shoebox cage with one Igloo per cage for enrichment and maintained in an animal holding room at the KSC ACF. The KSC ACF veterinary staff performed health checks daily, and weighed the mice, food, and water twice weekly and their food and water were replaced once weekly. The Validation Viv mice were dissected and processed using the same timelines and protocols as their respective FLT and GC mice.Video health checks Daily health checks were performed for Experimental and Validation FLT and GC animals (health assessments were performed on Viv animals as described in the Vivarium control section above) by trained ground personnel beginning one day after the animals were transferred from the Transporter to the Habitats (GMT 269, September 26, 2014). Initially, 2 hours of video (one hour each during the light and dark cycles) were recorded from each Habitat. Two cameras were located in each side of the Habitat - one near the lixits and the other near the filter. These videos were downlinked to Ames Research Center (ARC, Moffett Field, CA) via Marshal Flight Space Center (MFSC, Huntsville, AL), and animal health checks were performed by observing and documenting the health and behaviors of the animals for 1 hour during the light cycle and 1 hour during the dark cycle, daily from each Habitat. However, due to thermal issues experienced with this recording schedule, the video health checks for the Validation mice were shortened to approximately 15 minutes. Starting on Oct 10, 2014 (GMT 283), the health checks during the light cycle were discontinued with concurrence from the Institutional Animal Care And Use Committee (IACUC) and for the remainder of the mission, real-time health checks were performed during the dark cycle only. Animal health check forms were used to record daily observations of the following: Habitat ID, Habitat Side, Camera position, Health Status, GMT time/date, number of animals observed, animal cycle, and animal behaviors (drinking, eating, grooming, ambulation, etc.). Animal activity was recorded during the health check on a scale of 1–3 based on different behaviors as described in Fig. 3A. To further evaluate animal behavior on-orbit, one 24-hour video monitoring session was performed in which the animals were observed for 10 minutes every hour.Radiation exposure The RR-1 Validation mice were exposed to radiation for 37 days (4 days in transit and 33 days on the ISS). The dosimetry mapping of radiation levels across the U.S. Lab indicated that during the 37 day period the daily dose was approximately 207 μGy/day and the total dose recorded by an instrument in the U.S. lab was 7.377 mGy. This range falls within expected and allowable radation doses. In addition, the Rodent Habitats were inside a locker and inserted into the EXPRESS racks, which provided additional shielding to the mice. Radiation doses during transit to the ISS were not determined; however, since the mice remained inside the radiation belts during transit, we estimated that the dose rate during transit was approximately the same as while on board the ISS, which would be 0.6 to 0.9 mGy during transit.Food and water depletion To provide an estimate of water and food consumption for comparison between FLT and control groups, foodbars and water boxes from their respective cages were weighed before launch and after return to Earth. Since the mice may drain some water from the lixits and cause foodbars to crumble without being consumed, results are reported as food and water depletion (rather than consumption) and normalized to the number of mice in each compartment per day (n = 2 measurements/group).Post-flight sample return and processing Experimental and Validation FLT frozen tissues, carcasses, and remaining food and water were returned to Earth 12–13 and 105 days after dissection, respectively, and all frozen samples were kept at ≤−70 °C during transport. All Experimental and Validation Basal, GC, and Viv (Validation only) frozen tissue samples and carcasses were shipped from KSC to ARC on dry ice then stored at −80 °C until they were processed about 4 months later. Frozen carcasses of the Validation mice were weighed upon receipt at ARC, and the body weights of the 8 non-dissected mice from each group were compared to their respective weights at L-3 days. Tests performed prior to launch had confirmed that the long term freezing and partial thawing procedure did not affect measured body weights (data not shown). After brief (~5 min), partial thawing at room temperature, disection was initiated for the following organs until all tissues were complete about ~35–45 min after removal from the freezer. Immeidately after dissections, tissues and were weighed, and then preserved by storing in RNAlater: gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus(EDL), quadriceps, liver (part of the liver was also frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at −80 °C to be used in enzyme activity assays described below), spleen, thymus, and adrenal glands. Additionally, 3 mice that were the same sex, strain, and age as the Validation mice (female C57BL/6J, ~21 weeks at time of euthanasia) were euthanized by IP injection with Euthasol followed by cervical dislocation, then select tissues were dissected and prepared in the same manner as the Validation mice except under optimal laboratory conditions, i.e. aliquots of livers were immediately frozen post-dissection in liquid nitrogen for the enzyme assays, and spleens and aliquots of livers were immediately preserved in RNAlater, to serve as a positive control for tissue quality. Tissues were stored at −80 °C immediately after freezing in liquid nitrogen, and tissues preserved in RNAlater were kept at 4 °C for 2 days then frozen and stored at −80 °C.RNA isolation and evaluation RNA was extracted from the spleen and liver tissue samples from Validation Basal, Viv, GC, FLT, and positive control (PC) mice, and from the ISS National Lab 5 wildtype mice using TRIzol reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The RNA samples were then treated with DNase I incubation mix (2.727 Kunitz units/uL; RNase-free DNase kit, Qiagen Catalogue #79254), and RNA concentration and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was determined by measuring the RNA integrity number (RIN) using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), where a RIN of 10 is considered intact and 0 totally degraded RNA. The analysis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The total RNA extracted for each tissue sample was converted to cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog # 4368814) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. TaqMan Gene Expression Assay primer and probe sets (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for real-time, quantitative PCR (RTqPCR) analysis of Hmgcr (Mm01282491_g1), Rpl19 (Mm02601633_g1), Gapdh (Mm99999915_g1), Cat (Mm00437992_m1), Gsr (Mm00439154_m1), Serpina1e (Mm00833655_m1), Cdkn1a (Mm00432448_m1), Chka (Mm00442759_m1), Pnpla3 (Mm00504420_m1), Tef (Mm00457513_m1), Snd1 (Mm00490722_m1), Nr4a1 (Mm01300401_m1), Nox4 (Mm00479246_m1), and Taf3 (Mm01337577_m1). RTqPCR analyses were carried out using 20 ng of cDNA on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog #4485694). Gene expression in liver samples was normalized to the Rpl19 (all but Cat) or Gapdh (Cat) endogenous reference genes. All data are expressed as 2−(Ct(target)-Ct(endogenous reference)). Liver enzyme activity assays Protein was extracted from an aliquot of each liver sample from Basal, GC, and FLT Experimental mice (n = 5 from each group), and from Basal, Viv, GC, and FLT Validation mice (n = 2 for the tissues that were dissected either on the ground or on-orbit then frozen; and n = 5 (out of 8) for the samples that were dissected from frozen carcasses from each group), as well as their respective positive controls (n = 5 for Experimental control and n = 3 for Validation control). Activities of three enzymes were determined using the method previously described57. Briefly, catalase activity was measured using the colorimetric assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI), and normalized to total protein levels (Thermo Scientific™ Pierce™ Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Kit, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Catalase protein levels were measured using the Catalase Human ELISA Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and specific activity of the enzyme was calculated (U/μg catalase protein). GSR activity levels were determined using the GSR Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and GAPDH activity levels were determined using the colorimetric GAPDH assay kit (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA). Statistical analysis Statistical significance was determined by comparing 4 and 3 groups from the same cohorts for the Validation and Experimental study, respectively; for the Validation mice, these included the FLT, GC, VIV and Basal groups and for Experimental mice these included FLT, GC and Basal groups. For Validation mice, uniformity of variance was tested by Levene’s test and normality goodness of fit by Shapiro-Wilk. One-factor ANOVA was then applied to the data, and if the main effect showed P < 0.05, was followed by a Tukey-Kramer HSD post hoc analysis. The sole exception to application of ANOVA was Validation liver catalase activity, which did not display normal distribution. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to Validation catalase results. P < 0.05 was accepted as significant. All data shown are mean +/− S.D. Data analyses were performed using JMP13.1 (SAS).",
    "results": "Results Animals Mice flown on the RR-1 mission were designated as either NASA “Validation” mice (Female C57BL/6J, 16 wks) or ISS National Lab “Experimental” mice (Female C57BL/6NTac, 32 wks) to achieve the main objectives. NASA Validation mice consisted of four groups to enable assessment of the contributions of age, cage configuration, and spaceflight by comparing baseline (Basal) to Vivarium (Viv) controls, ground control (GC) to Viv, and spaceflight (FLT) to GC, respectively (Fig. 1). ISS National Lab Experimental mice included three groups: FLT, age-matched GC, and Basal groups. Animal operations and tissue processing were carried out as described in Supplementary Table S1 and depicted in Fig. 2. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental and Control Group assignments. Validation and Experimental female mice were divided into weight-matched groups as shown (n = 10/group). All groups were acclimated as described in Methods. Basal and Viv control mice were housed in standard vivarium cages, FLT and GC mice in flight hardware, and GC groups were kept in an ISS Environmental Simulator on a 4-day delay to mimic FLT conditions. A Vivarium group was not included in the Experimental study.Figure 2. Open in a new tab Schematic of Flight animal operations. (A) Flow chart of operations from launch through descent of processed tissues. Experimental (n = 10/compartment, 32 wks old at launch) and Validation (n = 10, 16 wks old at launch) mice were loaded into Transporters 2 days before launch, launched on SpaceX Dragon, then transferred into Habitats on the ISS 4 days later (5 mice/compartment). (B) Mice were euthanized after either 21/22 days (Experimental mice) or 37 days (Validation mice) after launch. The indicated tissues were processed for the Validation study. Spleens and livers from 5 of the 10 ISS National Lab Experimental mice were analyzed in the Validation study. *A Vivarium group was not included in the ISS National Lab Experimental study; **MuRF1 KO transgenic mice.C57BL/6J mice from the Jackson Laboratory were used for the Validation study since this strain has been used for previous missions on the U.S. Shuttles. For the U.S. National Lab’s Experimental study, the C57BL strain from Taconic (C57BL/6NTac) was used as the corresponding wildtype strain for the MuRF1KO mice14. Attending veterinarian observations Health checks were performed daily through the use of downlinked videos by the Rodent Research Project Science team and the Attending Veterinarian (AV) was consulted as needed. In addition, the AV performed select audits of video to observe the animals throughout the mission. FLT and GC mice exhibited qualitatively, a typical range of behaviors, including eating, drinking, exploratory behavior, self‐and allo‐grooming, and social interactions indicative of healthy animals (also see Ronca et al.18). The extent of physical contact between FLT mice appeared less than in GC mice within a huddle (due to microgravity), although all areas of the cage were not within camera view, including space between the wall and foodbar assembly where the mice usually congregated during the light cycle, when most huddling behavior is expected to occur. FLT mice propelled themselves freely and actively throughout the Habitat using their forelimbs to push off a surface, and they quickly learned to anchor themselves using tails and/or paws as described in Ronca et al.18. The animals found spaces between the walls and the foodbar or lixits in which to rest. Spontaneous ambulatory behavior was commonly observed but did not interfere with the intake of food and water and was not deemed cause to remove any animals from the experiments. Spaceflight increased animal activity (validation mice) To assess animal activity, behavior on-orbit and on the ground were observed and recorded during the daily health checks. Validation FLT mice showed increased overall physical activity (eating, drinking, ambulating) in microgravity compared to Validation GC mice (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S1). As expected, the animals were more active in the dark cycle than in the light cycle in all groups (Supplementary Fig. S1). The Validation FLT mice displayed a rapid and repetitive running behavior during the dark cycle that started at ~day 7–10 in microgravity, which was not observed at any time in the GC group; Experimental FLT mice also engaged in the running behavior albeit much less. No injuries of any kind were observed during the flight. Additional detailed analysis was performed to quantify and analyze on-orbit behavior and activity18. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Spaceflight increased animal activity. (A) The scoring system used to quantify animal activity. (B) Relative daily activity scores for mice in each side of the Habitat for Validation Flight and Ground Control groups. N = 2 Habitat sides (containing 5 mice each) for each group of Validation Flight and Ground Control mice. Food and water depletion Both Validation and Experimental FLT groups showed greater food depletion compared to their respective GC groups (Supplementary Table S2). (Note that the results are described as depletion amounts rather than consumption due to the inability to discern between food and water comsuption versus wastage.) There was about twice as much water depleted in Validation FLT compared to GC (Supplementary Table S2). Similar differences between FLT and GC in food and water depletion were observed with Experimental cohorts. Body and tissue weights (validation mice) To assess general health, body weights of mice were measured twice weekly during acclimation and the final weights were measured 3 days prior to launch (L-3d) in order to select the FLT, GC, Viv, and Basal groups (as described in Materials and Methods). The body weights of Validation mice in the Basal, Viv, GC, and FLT groups did not differ 3d before launch (L-3d) (Fig. 4). There were no significant differences in body weights between any of the Validation groups at the termination of the 37d experiment (Fig. 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Spaceflight did not affect body weight. Mice in each group of the Validation study were weighed before launch (L-3, n = 10 for each group), and the intact carcasses that were frozen at the end of the study (L + 37 days) were thawed on Earth and weighed (n = 8 for each group). Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA.In addition to total body weight, the following muscles and organs were dissected from thawed Validation carcasses and weighed: gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), quadriceps, liver, spleen, thymus, and adrenal glands. The raw weights of thymi were significantly different between FLT and GC animals; FLT thymus glands were ~32% higher than GC. (Fig. 5A). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Spaceflight caused organ weight changes. After Validation FLT and control animals were euthanized, 8/10 intact carcasses per group were wrapped, rapidly frozen, and stored at −80 °C. The indicated organs were dissected from the frozen carcasses of all Validation groups, thawed and weighed. Raw weights of each organ (A), and organ weights after normalization to body weight (B) were quantified. N = 8 per group (FLT, GC, Viv, and Basal) for adrenal and thymus weights; n = 8 per group for spleen weights (except for the FLT group, n = 7); n = 7 per GC group and n = 6 per FLT and Viv groups for liver weights. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.005; ***p < 0.001. Statistical significance was determined by Levene’s test for uniformity of variance and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality goodness of fit followed by one-way ANOVA. *Indicates significant differences by Tukey-Kramer HSD post hoc test.The thymus glands normalized to body mass weighed more in FLT mice than GC (by 35%), as did the livers (by 33%)(Fig. 5B). The normalized weights of the adrenal glands between the two groups did not significantly differ (p = 0.09) (Fig. 5B). The soleus muscle weight was reduced by ~19% in Validation FLT versus GC animals (Fig. 6). Of all the muscle tissues analyzed (gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior, EDL, and quadriceps), the soleus was the only one that showed significant differences in FLT compared to GC (Supplementary Fig. S2). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Spaceflight reduced soleus mass. The soleus was dissected from the frozen carcasses of all Validation groups, thawed and weighed according to methods. Raw soleus weights (A), and soleus weights after normalization to body weight (B) were quantified. Data are shown as mass per both hindlimbs (average). N = 8 for each group. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Statistical significance was determined by Levene’s test for uniformity of variance and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality goodness of fit followed by one-way ANOVA. *Indicates significant differences by Tukey-Kramer HSD post hoc test.Differences between age-matched control groups indicating cage effects also were observed. The spleens and livers from GC animals weighed less than Viv controls by 22% and 19% respectively (Fig. 5B). Quality of sample return from spaceflight animals To test preservation quality, three approaches were used following on-orbit dissection. (1) freezing (liver) (2) preservation in RNAlater (spleen), or (3) freezing carcasses on-orbit followed by dissecting tissues and organs from frozen carcasses after return to Earth. To determine if these methods were sufficient to achieve high quality tissue samples, liver samples were analyzed for select enzyme activities and total RNA was extracted from liver and spleen samples (as described in Materials and Methods) and RIN value obtained as an indicator of RNA quality. Activity levels of the enzymes Catalase, Glutathione reductase (GSR), and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in all groups of the Validation and Experimental mice were measured (Fig. 7). No differences between groups were observed in the Experimental mice. There were no significant differences in GSR levels when all four groups of the Validation mice were compared. GAPDH activity levels also were not significantly different between GC and FLT groups in Validation mice. However, comparing the age-matched groups (i.e. Viv, GC and FLT), GSR and GAPDH activity levels were elevated significantly in FLT mice compared to GC mice (23% and 74% respectively), but not compared to Viv controls (Fig. 7). Catalase activity in Validation FLT mice appeared elevated compared to GC and Viv controls, but showed only a trend for a main effect difference (P = 0.0846, Kruskal-Wallis test). Similarly, catalase protein content appeared elevated in FLT compared to GC, but comparison of the age-matched groups showed only a trend for a main effect difference (P < 0.0621, ANOVA, data not shown). Catalase specific activity (I.U./μg catalase protein) was not different between the groups (data not shown). In addition, activity levels of these enzymes were comparable to values obtained for samples collected as positive control samples (PC), which had been dissected immediately after performing euthanasia on the mice and then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen (data not shown). Thus, both on-orbit recovery and frozen carcass recovery did not markedly deplete activity levels. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Spaceflight increased liver GSR and GAPDH activity. Livers were dissected after 21/22 days in microgravity and frozen at −80 °C until recovery (Experimental mice, A), or were recovered post-flight, after 37d, from frozen carcasses (Validation mice, B). Tissue lysates were analyzed for liver enzyme activities. N = 4–5 for each group.

Statistics were performed without the inclusion of Basal values. For catalase activity, statistical significance was determined by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. GSR and GAPDH activities were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer HSD post hoc test.The RNA extracted from spleens of Experimental FLT mice which had been dissected on-orbit then preserved in RNAlater, and from livers dissected on-orbit then immediately frozen, had RIN values > 8.0 (Fig. 8A), which is generally considered sufficient for demanding molecular analyses such as RNA sequencing. The RNA extracted from the Validation FLT animal livers (that were dissected on-orbit then immediately frozen) and spleens (dissected on-orbit and preserved in RNAlater) had RIN values, >6.5 and >7.6, respectively (Fig. 8B). RNA extracted from liver tissues dissected from the frozen carcasses of Validation FLT mice had RIN values > 6.5 (Fig. 8C). Figure 8. Open in a new tab RNA quality from from livers and spleens dissected on-orbit and/or from frozen carcasses. RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN) were determined to assess RNA quality as described in methods. RNA was extracted from livers and spleens of (A) Experimental mice and (B) Validation mice that were dissected and preserved on-orbit (or on the ground) as described in Methods. (C) RNA was extracted from livers that were dissected from Validation carcasses that had been frozen intact on-orbit (or on the ground) and stored at −80C until the time of dissection. N values are indicated for each group. Liver gene expression analysis (validation mice) To begin to assess gene expression in samples recovered from frozen carcasses (FC, n = 5/group) and on-orbit dissected tissue (OoD, n = 2/group), total RNA was analyzed by RTqPCR for expression of 12 liver-associated genes: Hmgcr, Cat, Gsr, Serpina1e, Cdkn1a, Chka, Pnpla3, Tef, Snd1, Nr4a1, Nox4, and Taf. These specific genes were selected for analysis on the basis of prior spaceflight findings26,27 and preliminary bioinformatics of RNAsequencing results (Homer Fogle and Jonathan Galazka, personal communication). In frozen carcasses, expression of Gsr, Cdkn1a, and Chka were elevated in FLT mice compared with GC mice, and Tef expression was reduced as a result of spaceflight (Supplementary Fig. S3). Patterns of relative gene expression in samples recovered from frozen carcasses of FLT vs GC mice from the Validation study did not appear to be the same in samples recovered from on orbit dissected tissues. Although the small sample size from on orbit dissected tissues precludes drawing definitive conclusions, these prelimary results indicate that the method of sample recovery may have affected RTqPCR results obtained.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The main objective of this work was to develop new capability for conducting long duration, rodent experiments in space which both minimize the complications of non-specific, chronic stress responses and allow for sample recovery on-orbit, thereby avoiding the confounding variables associated with returning to Earth. All animals were healthy throughout the duration of the mission as evidenced by daily video health checks, maintenance of body weights compared with ground controls, and an absence of immune organ atrophy (thymus, spleen) or adrenal hypertrophy relative to ground controls. As expected, the mass of the soleus, consisting predominantly of type I muscle fibers which typically atrophy with disuse, was significantly lower in Validation FLT mice than in GC mice housed in the flight hardware (Fig. 6), whereas other muscles did not. Further, we found that all of the forms of tissue collection/preservation tested (on-orbit dissection followed by freezing, preservation in RNAlater, or freezing carcasses on-orbit followed by dissecting tissues and organs from frozen carcasses after they were returned to Earth) provided samples with high enough quality for molecular analyses, although the tissue collection/preservation methods may have affected results obtained. Taken together, these results demonstrate a new capability for long duration experimentation with on-orbit sample recovery. Body weight is considered a sensitive indicator for monitoring animal health. We found Validation FLT mice had similar body mass as a consequence of spaceflight when compared to GC and Viv mice (Fig. 4). This finding is in contrast to previous reports from numerous rodent spaceflight experiments28. Some previous spaceflight experiments have on occasion shown that spaceflight can lead to reduced body weights compared to baseline values and ground controls29,30, complicating interpretation of the results obtained. If the body weight loss is due to persistent stress response entailing activation of the HPA (hypothalamic, pituitary and adrenal) axis, then it can be difficult to distinguish between effects of reduced gravity-dependent loading in space vs. endocrine stress. These findings, together with similar findings from tissue weights of adrenal gland, thymus and spleen and behavioral observations, are consistent with the interpretation that habitation on-orbit did not provoke a chronic stress response. Both the Validation and Experimental FLT mice engaged in more active behaviors than their respective GC mice (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S1). This finding was surprising but consistent with a recent report that simulated weightlessness (14d) also leads to increased locomotion relative to ambulatory controls after a transient initial period of reduced motor activity31. Furthermore, the Validation FLT mice exhibited a rapid, repetitive running behavior, which was not observed in the Experimental mice (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1). This difference in behavior between the cohorts was likely due to their age differences (the Validation mice were 16-weeks old at launch, whereas the Experimental mice were 32-weeks at launch). A detailed behavioral analysis from this mission can be found in Ronca, et al.18. Atrophy of the slow-twitch soleus muscle, which provides postural support during mechanical loading, occurs as a consequence of spaceflight in rodents12,32. Consistent with previous studies, we observed a ~19% decrement in soleus weight in Validation FLT mice compared to GC (Fig. 6), but no differences in the EDL. Despite previously reported atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscle due to microgravity12,29,30,33, no difference in gastrocnemius mass was observed in Validation FLT versus GC mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). The lack of atrophy in the gastrocnemius was especially surprising since C57BL/6 female mice (9 weeks old at launch) utilized in previous space shuttle experiments29,30 housed in very similar hardware to that used in this study, showed significant atrophy of gastrocnemious, soleus and tibialis anterior. Interestingly, these mice were shown to lose body mass with spaceflight compared with basal controls despite their relatively young age and expected growth pattern. A possible explanation for the differences in gastrocnemius findings between these previous space shuttle investigations29,30 and the current study is that young, growing mice at time of launch may be more sensitive to spaceflight effects than older (Validation) mice. Alternatively, perhaps mice are less active during initial exposure to spaceflight, leading to muscle atrophy, and then become more active over time, which in fact was found to be the case by Ronca et al.18. In a longer duration experiment such as Validation RR-1, indices of atrophy may reverse. In any case, the finding that there was reduced soleus muscle mass in the Validation FLT mice, as well as the Experimental FLT mice14 was consistent with expected findings of slow-twitch muscle atrophy due to long duration spaceflight. With respect to organ weights, thymus glands and livers were significantly heavier in FLT mice compared with GC mice (Fig. 5) whereas spleen weights did not differ. Typically, shorter duration experiments than the Validation study show that spaceflight causes atrophy of the immune organs, which is often attributed to an endocrine stress response, although direct effects of microgravity on immune cells in vitro also occur34. The greater thymus weights observed in FLT animals relative to GC contrasts to observations from previous, short and long term missions27,35–37, but is consistent with findings from other spaceflight experiments. Unlike previous missions, tissues from mice analyzed in the present study were preserved on-orbit, and therefore the animals did not endure the added challenges of a return flight to Earth and ambulation, which can potentially affect gene expression as well as soft tissue weights38. Livers from Validation FLT mice had a 33% greater mass than GC controls (when normalized to body weights), a finding consistent with only some prior spaceflight studies27. Jonscher et al.39 reported increased accumulation of hepatic lipid droplets and increased total triglycerides in spaceflight mice livers compared with livers from GC mice and Blaber et al. describe impaired oxidative defence pathways due to spaceflight26. Early, short duration rat spaceflight experiments showed that spaceflight increased hepatic lipid peroxidation, altered enzyme protein levels40,41, and together with later studies, led to the proposal that spaceflight leads to pathological changes consistent with the eventual development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with long duration spaceflight39. The relevance of spaceflight-induced liver toxicity in rodents to human astronauts remains uncertain. Unlike musculoskeletal and immune effects of spaceflight which are observed in both humans and rodents, to our knowledge there have been no reports showing direct evidence that liver function is altered in astronauts during missions lasting up to one year. In Validation mice, spaceflight increased activity levels of GSR and GAPDH, relative to cage-matched GC. GSR plays a critical role in resisting oxidative stress and spaceflight can induce ROS-related activity27,42. Our findings that GSR activity levels were elevated in FLT mice relative to GC contrasts to those of Hollander et al.43, who shows reduced hepatic GSR activity in rats after an 8d flight along with a decline in other antioxidant enzymes and increased malondialdehyde, consistent with a state of oxidative stress. The differences in GSR activity between Validation (33d on-orbit) versus Experimental (17–18d on-orbit) mice, as well as rats (8d)43, may be due in part to the length of spaceflight exposure although other explanations certainly are possible (e.g., age). GAPDH plays a principal role in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Although GAPDH is commonly considered a housekeeping gene and applied as a control for gene or protein expression levels, it is in fact a redox-sensitive protein regulated at the transcriptional level by insulin and hypoxia44 and also in the liver during periods of nutritional insufficiency45. Further, short duration shuttle missions lead to reduced rather than elevated expression of glycolysis-related genes in the liver46. Together, these findings suggest time-dependent regulation of oxidative defense and glycolytic pathways during spaceflight, which will require further study in future time-course experiments. Enzymatic activity can be a good indicator of the protein quality following collection and preservation, and therefore, we measured activity levels of select enzymes from livers dissected and frozen on-orbit by astronauts and those dissected from frozen carcasses after return to Earth in comparison to control samples collected on Earth (positive controls). GC sample collection and storage was conducted to duplicate the on-orbit procedures (including dissection timing, preservation and storage) with the highest fidelity possible. Enzyme activities from livers of Experimental FLT mice that were dissected and preserved on-orbit and from livers of GC mice, were similar to those of samples prepared under optimal laboratory conditions, as well as protocols for GC sample collection and storage that were specifically planned to duplicate on-orbit procedures, including dissection timing and preservation. The RNA extracted from livers that were dissected then immediately frozen on-orbit were compared with those dissected from the frozen carcasses. RNA from livers, either freshly dissected or from carcasses, exhibited RIN values that exceeded 6.5 (Fig. 8). RIN values for spleens that were dissected then preserved in RNAlater (Fig. 8C) exceeded >7.5. RNA recovered from frozen spleens in preflight experiments consistently yielded RNA with very low RIN values, possibly due to higher RNase expression in this organ (results not shown); therefore this approach for sample recovery was not used on the flight samples. Taken together, findings from the liver tissue indicate that both methods of spaceflight tissue preservation were sufficient to yield RNA with RIN values generally considered adequate for most molecular analyses although possible differences in patterns of gene expression assessed by RTqPCR require further evaluation to determine if recovery from frozen carcasses yields unreliable results, perhaps due to warm ischemia47 in liver samples recovered from the carcasses (Supplementary Fig. 3). Studies are in progress to further assess this possibility. Conducting spaceflight experiments presents unique challenges to making rapid progress in understanding the biological responses of rodents to microgravity. Not the least of these challenges is ensuring that control animals on Earth are provided a physical environment that replicates the environment on the spacecraft to the greatest extent possible. One limit of this study, as opposed to some prior spaceflight missions48–50 is that ground controls were not subjected to the vibration, acceleration and noise stimuli which is unavoidable during launch of rodents into space. This was due to logistical and cost limitations imposed on this system. We reasoned, though, that because the system was intended to support long duration experiments, the effects of transient stressors associated with launch would diminish by the time of sample recovery. Further study is needed to justify this expectation, especially for those tissue responses which are most likely to be sensitive to the stress of launch. Further, unique habitats and environmental control systems must be devised to adequately support both FLT and GC animals. The hardware developed to transport and house the mice did in fact display differences; we found GC values for several parameters were different than Viv, as others also have found using the heritage habitat, AEM, on Shuttle missions (e.g.43,51). While comparison of FLT mice to the cage-matched GC group is clearly of greatest relevance for determining the influence of spaceflight, the Viv control group is also useful for comparing results obtained in a given spaceflight experiment to standard housing conditions in investigators’ home institutions. In conclusion, on the basis of our findings and those of others, we propose that physiological accommodation to the spaceflight environment entails at least a two-phase process. An initial acute (<2–3 wk) phase yields rapid and pronounced differences in tissue biology, which are likely to be dynamic, transient, and sensitive to the acute psychological and physical stress of launch, and adaptation to the novel microgravity environment. Evidence for an early, transient phase of adaptation is based on findings from previous spaceflight experiments that often show spaceflight causes decrements in body mass, immune organ atrophy, and indices of HPA axis activation after missions lasting less than 3 wk12,28–30,52,53. We suggest a second, long duration (>2–3 wk) phase follows when the animals have acclimated to reduced loading microgravity; our findings that body weights, immune organ mass and adrenal mass were not lower in Validation spaceflight mice compared to ground controls or basal groups support this proposal. Return to earth would be expected to introduce a new phase when the effects of gravity-dependent loading exceeds the new steady-state achieved during residence in microgravity. Since the first mission described here, the hardware system and operations for this project were developed further to support return to Earth of living animals, enabling study of the entire cycle of long duration space travel. Although there are individual variabilities, similar phases of adaptation to spaceflight are seen in crew members.",

Copyright notice ID: 7012842 PMID: 32047211 Abstract Animal models are useful for exploring the health consequences of prolonged spaceflight. Capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth orbit with on-board sample recovery, thereby avoiding complications caused by return to Earth. For NASA’s Rodent Research-1 mission, female mice (ten 32 wk C57BL/6NTac; ten 16 wk C57BL/6J) were launched on an unmanned vehicle, then resided on the International Space Station for 21/22d or 37d in microgravity. Mice were euthanized on-orbit, livers and spleens dissected, and remaining tissues frozen in situ for later analyses. Mice appeared healthy by daily video health checks and body, adrenal, and spleen weights of 37d-flight (FLT) mice did not differ from ground controls housed in flight hardware (GC), while thymus weights were 35% greater in FLT than GC. Mice exposed to 37d of spaceflight displayed elevated liver mass (33%) and select enzyme activities compared to GC, whereas 21/22d-FLT mice did not. FLT mice appeared more physically active than respective GC while soleus muscle showed expected atrophy. RNA and enzyme activity levels in tissues recovered on-orbit were of acceptable quality. Thus, this system establishes a new capability for conducting long-duration experiments in space, enables sample recovery on-orbit, and avoids triggering standard indices of chronic stress. Subject terms: Microarray analysis, Ageing, Homeostasis, Translational researchIntroduction Space travel over the past five decades reveals that multiple organ systems are influenced by novel environmental conditions above the Earth’s surface. In addition to reduced gravitational acceleration, spaceflight confers other unique environmental challenges including confinement in a closed environment, altered gas composition and exposure to space radiation, each of which has the potential to have physiological effects. Protecting humans in space requires a clear understanding of the myriad of physiologic changes that can occur in response to these exposures and their associated medical risks. As on Earth, experimentation with rodents in space enables detailed exploration of physiology and mechanisms, as well as potential mitigation strategies using experimental approaches that are not possible with humans as subjects. All but two spaceflight rodent experiments, prior to the Rodent Research (RR)-1 mission described here, have entailed sample collection only after return to Earth. In fact, some of the observed consequences of spaceflight on tissue structure1 and gene expression2 can be attributed to forces related to return and ambulation on Earth prior to sample recovery, rather than to habitation in space per se. Therefore, there is a pressing need for spaceflight hardware and operational systems to further explore the consequences of long duration space travel on rodents, while avoiding the confounding variables introduced by reentry and return of the animals to Earth. Previous Russian Cosmos and NASA Space Shuttle missions provided multiple opportunities to perform rodent experiments up to three weeks in duration, which contributed to our current understanding of how mammals adapt to the space environment. Rodent Space Shuttle experiments conducted between 1965 and 2011 demonstrated extensive changes in the immune, musculoskeletal, and central nervous and cardiovascular systems, as well as endocrine, hematologic and metabolic changes3, although results between missions were sometimes inconsistent. Various independent variables such as strain, age, and duration may account for at least some of the mixed results obtained between different experiments; however, the relatively short duration of all Shuttle missions is likely to be a major factor explaining the discrepancies. Tissues adapt dynamically and at different rates to the allostatic load imposed in the course of a prolonged spaceflight experiment, which entails introduction into a novel flight hardware caging environment, launch, habitation in microgravity, then typically reentry and ambulation on Earth prior to sample recovery. There also have been a limited number of long duration (>3 wk), rodent spaceflight experiments. A recent unmanned, Russian biosatellite experiment (Bion M1) that entailed sample recovery after return to Earth revealed that 30 days of spaceflight caused muscle, thymus and spleen atrophy (4,5 deficits in structure of various skeletal elements (6,7), altered structural morphology and changes in gene expression of several tissues5,8. The lengthy interval (13 hr) between capsule reentry and sample recovery for the Bion M1 mission may have affected at least some of these findings. The longest duration experiment with rodents in space completed to date (91d) in the European Space Agency’s Mouse Drawer System9 revealed intriguing differences in oxidative damage to red blood cells10 and skeletal decrements11, although this experiment had a limited sample size. Recently, the Japanese Space Agency performed important experiments with a newly developed flight hardware system supporting singly-housed mice, which can be centrifuged at 1 g to replace Earth’s gravity level while on the ISS12. Findings from their experiments reveal that 1 g artificial gravity mitigates the expected bone loss and muscle atrophy12 as well as retinal changes13 that occur after long duration microgravity. Each of the various flight hardware systems developed for long duration spaceflight has unique features, which have the potential to influence results obtained (Table 1). Table 1.

Important objectives included monitoring animal health and welfare, and recovering samples of sufficiently high quality for global gene expression analysis using current demanding methods. The RR-1 flight experiment consisted of two separate studies with a total of 20 mice; one NASA Validation study (10 mice) and one ISS National Lab Experimental study (10 mice). The NASA Validation study was designed to evaluate the capaibilities of the rodent hardware, on-orbit operations, and sample retrieval for conducting high quality rodent expeirments consistent with current standards. The Experimental study was sponsored by the ISS National Lab on behalf of Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, and was designed to determine spaceflight effects on muscle atrophy in MuRF1 knockout (KO) mice and wild type (WT) mice14–16. Results from both studies contributed to the findings described in this paper. The Rodent Habitat differs from other long duration spaceflight housing systems12,17 in that it provides for both group-housing and internal wire grating that enable grabbing and purposeful locomotion throughout the cage, much like human crew do throughout the cabin. To accommodate unique aspects of the Dragon transport vehicle and the ISS, flight hardware was modified from the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), that was used successfully in 27 missions with rats or mice aboard the Space Shuttle3 followed by multiple RR missions14,18–25. The RR-1 validation mission launched adult, female mice to low earth orbit in an unmanned Dragon capsule on SpaceX-4, then after 4 days the RR-1 mice were transferred to the International Space Station (ISS) where they resided for up to 33 days (total 37 days in microgravity). Female mice were selected for this mission for two reasons: first, because only female mice were flown on earlier missions that used the heritage AEM group-housed hardware system, and second, to avoid potential complications due to aggression which is more common in males than females. After this first Validation mission, pre-flight experiments were performed to optimize conditions for acclimating males in group-housed conditions22, and subsequently flight experiments were conducted successfully with males19. Important aspects of the study design included use of adult animals, a cage system that enabled purposeful locomotion of the animals throughout the habitat, and measurements of basic indices of animal health that were compromised in past spaceflight experiments. Animal health and behavior were monitored by daily downlinked video, and samples were dissected both on-orbit by astronauts and after return to Earth from frozen carcasses. Subsequently, tissue samples were distributed to multiple scientists across the world for detailed analyses. We found mice thrived in the housing, as assessed by behavior, body weights and organ mass (adrenal, thymus, spleen). Further, samples dissected on-orbit yielded high quality RNA and protein (select liver enzyme activities). Recovery of livers dissected from frozen carcasses yielded RNA with high RIN values, although further work is needed to determine conclusively if transcriptional profiles are the same in livers freshly dissected on orbit compared to livers recovered post-flight from frozen carcasses.Results Animals Mice flown on the RR-1 mission were designated as either NASA “Validation” mice (Female C57BL/6J, 16 wks) or ISS National Lab “Experimental” mice (Female C57BL/6NTac, 32 wks) to achieve the main objectives. NASA Validation mice consisted of four groups to enable assessment of the contributions of age, cage configuration, and spaceflight by comparing baseline (Basal) to Vivarium (Viv) controls, ground control (GC) to Viv, and spaceflight (FLT) to GC, respectively (Fig. 1). ISS National Lab Experimental mice included three groups: FLT, age-matched GC, and Basal groups. Animal operations and tissue processing were carried out as described in Supplementary Table S1 and depicted in Fig. 2. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental and Control Group assignments. Validation and Experimental female mice were divided into weight-matched groups as shown (n = 10/group). All groups were acclimated as described in Methods. Basal and Viv control mice were housed in standard vivarium cages, FLT and GC mice in flight hardware, and GC groups were kept in an ISS Environmental Simulator on a 4-day delay to mimic FLT conditions. A Vivarium group was not included in the Experimental study.Figure 2. Open in a new tab Schematic of Flight animal operations. (A) Flow chart of operations from launch through descent of processed tissues. Experimental (n = 10/compartment, 32 wks old at launch) and Validation (n = 10, 16 wks old at launch) mice were loaded into Transporters 2 days before launch, launched on SpaceX Dragon, then transferred into Habitats on the ISS 4 days later (5 mice/compartment). (B) Mice were euthanized after either 21/22 days (Experimental mice) or 37 days (Validation mice) after launch. The indicated tissues were processed for the Validation study. Spleens and livers from 5 of the 10 ISS National Lab Experimental mice were analyzed in the Validation study. *A Vivarium group was not included in the ISS National Lab Experimental study; **MuRF1 KO transgenic mice.C57BL/6J mice from the Jackson Laboratory were used for the Validation study since this strain has been used for previous missions on the U.S. Shuttles. For the U.S. National Lab’s Experimental study, the C57BL strain from Taconic (C57BL/6NTac) was used as the corresponding wildtype strain for the MuRF1KO mice14.Attending veterinarian observations Health checks were performed daily through the use of downlinked videos by the Rodent Research Project Science team and the Attending Veterinarian (AV) was consulted as needed. In addition, the AV performed select audits of video to observe the animals throughout the mission. FLT and GC mice exhibited qualitatively, a typical range of behaviors, including eating, drinking, exploratory behavior, self‐and allo‐grooming, and social interactions indicative of healthy animals (also see Ronca et al.18). The extent of physical contact between FLT mice appeared less than in GC mice within a huddle (due to microgravity), although all areas of the cage were not within camera view, including space between the wall and foodbar assembly where the mice usually congregated during the light cycle, when most huddling behavior is expected to occur. FLT mice propelled themselves freely and actively throughout the Habitat using their forelimbs to push off a surface, and they quickly learned to anchor themselves using tails and/or paws as described in Ronca et al.18. The animals found spaces between the walls and the foodbar or lixits in which to rest. Spontaneous ambulatory behavior was commonly observed but did not interfere with the intake of food and water and was not deemed cause to remove any animals from the experiments.Spaceflight increased animal activity (validation mice) To assess animal activity, behavior on-orbit and on the ground were observed and recorded during the daily health checks. Validation FLT mice showed increased overall physical activity (eating, drinking, ambulating) in microgravity compared to Validation GC mice (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S1). As expected, the animals were more active in the dark cycle than in the light cycle in all groups (Supplementary Fig. S1). The Validation FLT mice displayed a rapid and repetitive running behavior during the dark cycle that started at ~day 7–10 in microgravity, which was not observed at any time in the GC group; Experimental FLT mice also engaged in the running behavior albeit much less. No injuries of any kind were observed during the flight. Additional detailed analysis was performed to quantify and analyze on-orbit behavior and activity18. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Spaceflight increased animal activity. (A) The scoring system used to quantify animal activity. (B) Relative daily activity scores for mice in each side of the Habitat for Validation Flight and Ground Control groups. N = 2 Habitat sides (containing 5 mice each) for each group of Validation Flight and Ground Control mice.Food and water depletion Both Validation and Experimental FLT groups showed greater food depletion compared to their respective GC groups (Supplementary Table S2). (Note that the results are described as depletion amounts rather than consumption due to the inability to discern between food and water comsuption versus wastage.) There was about twice as much water depleted in Validation FLT compared to GC (Supplementary Table S2). Similar differences between FLT and GC in food and water depletion were observed with Experimental cohorts.Body and tissue weights (validation mice) To assess general health, body weights of mice were measured twice weekly during acclimation and the final weights were measured 3 days prior to launch (L-3d) in order to select the FLT, GC, Viv, and Basal groups (as described in Materials and Methods). The body weights of Validation mice in the Basal, Viv, GC, and FLT groups did not differ 3d before launch (L-3d) (Fig. 4). There were no significant differences in body weights between any of the Validation groups at the termination of the 37d experiment (Fig. 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Spaceflight did not affect body weight. Mice in each group of the Validation study were weighed before launch (L-3, n = 10 for each group), and the intact carcasses that were frozen at the end of the study (L + 37 days) were thawed on Earth and weighed (n = 8 for each group). Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA.In addition to total body weight, the following muscles and organs were dissected from thawed Validation carcasses and weighed: gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), quadriceps, liver, spleen, thymus, and adrenal glands. The raw weights of thymi were significantly different between FLT and GC animals; FLT thymus glands were ~32% higher than GC. (Fig. 5A). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Spaceflight caused organ weight changes. After Validation FLT and control animals were euthanized, 8/10 intact carcasses per group were wrapped, rapidly frozen, and stored at −80 °C. The indicated organs were dissected from the frozen carcasses of all Validation groups, thawed and weighed. Raw weights of each organ (A), and organ weights after normalization to body weight (B) were quantified. N = 8 per group (FLT, GC, Viv, and Basal) for adrenal and thymus weights; n = 8 per group for spleen weights (except for the FLT group, n = 7); n = 7 per GC group and n = 6 per FLT and Viv groups for liver weights. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.005; ***p < 0.001. Statistical significance was determined by Levene’s test for uniformity of variance and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality goodness of fit followed by one-way ANOVA. *Indicates significant differences by Tukey-Kramer HSD post hoc test.The thymus glands normalized to body mass weighed more in FLT mice than GC (by 35%), as did the livers (by 33%)(Fig. 5B). The normalized weights of the adrenal glands between the two groups did not significantly differ (p = 0.09) (Fig. 5B). The soleus muscle weight was reduced by ~19% in Validation FLT versus GC animals (Fig. 6). Of all the muscle tissues analyzed (gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior, EDL, and quadriceps), the soleus was the only one that showed significant differences in FLT compared to GC (Supplementary Fig. S2). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Spaceflight reduced soleus mass. The soleus was dissected from the frozen carcasses of all Validation groups, thawed and weighed according to methods. Raw soleus weights (A), and soleus weights after normalization to body weight (B) were quantified. Data are shown as mass per both hindlimbs (average). N = 8 for each group. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Statistical significance was determined by Levene’s test for uniformity of variance and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality goodness of fit followed by one-way ANOVA. *Indicates significant differences by Tukey-Kramer HSD post hoc test.Differences between age-matched control groups indicating cage effects also were observed. The spleens and livers from GC animals weighed less than Viv controls by 22% and 19% respectively (Fig. 5B).Quality of sample return from spaceflight animals To test preservation quality, three approaches were used following on-orbit dissection. (1) freezing (liver) (2) preservation in RNAlater (spleen), or (3) freezing carcasses on-orbit followed by dissecting tissues and organs from frozen carcasses after return to Earth. To determine if these methods were sufficient to achieve high quality tissue samples, liver samples were analyzed for select enzyme activities and total RNA was extracted from liver and spleen samples (as described in Materials and Methods) and RIN value obtained as an indicator of RNA quality. Activity levels of the enzymes Catalase, Glutathione reductase (GSR), and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in all groups of the Validation and Experimental mice were measured (Fig. 7). No differences between groups were observed in the Experimental mice. There were no significant differences in GSR levels when all four groups of the Validation mice were compared. GAPDH activity levels also were not significantly different between GC and FLT groups in Validation mice. However, comparing the age-matched groups (i.e. Viv, GC and FLT), GSR and GAPDH activity levels were elevated significantly in FLT mice compared to GC mice (23% and 74% respectively), but not compared to Viv controls (Fig. 7). Catalase activity in Validation FLT mice appeared elevated compared to GC and Viv controls, but showed only a trend for a main effect difference (P = 0.0846, Kruskal-Wallis test). Similarly, catalase protein content appeared elevated in FLT compared to GC, but comparison of the age-matched groups showed only a trend for a main effect difference (P < 0.0621, ANOVA, data not shown). Catalase specific activity (I.U./μg catalase protein) was not different between the groups (data not shown). In addition, activity levels of these enzymes were comparable to values obtained for samples collected as positive control samples (PC), which had been dissected immediately after performing euthanasia on the mice and then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen (data not shown). Thus, both on-orbit recovery and frozen carcass recovery did not markedly deplete activity levels. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Spaceflight increased liver GSR and GAPDH activity. Livers were dissected after 21/22 days in microgravity and frozen at −80 °C until recovery (Experimental mice, A), or were recovered post-flight, after 37d, from frozen carcasses (Validation mice, B). Tissue lysates were analyzed for liver enzyme activities. N = 4–5 for each group. Significant main effect by comparing age-matched groups for GSR at P < 0.0256 and for GAPDH at P < 0.0147. *Indicates significant difference between FLT and GC. Statistics were performed without the inclusion of Basal values. For catalase activity, statistical significance was determined by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. GSR and GAPDH activities were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer HSD post hoc test.The RNA extracted from spleens of Experimental FLT mice which had been dissected on-orbit then preserved in RNAlater, and from livers dissected on-orbit then immediately frozen, had RIN values > 8.0 (Fig. 8A), which is generally considered sufficient for demanding molecular analyses such as RNA sequencing. The RNA extracted from the Validation FLT animal livers (that were dissected on-orbit then immediately frozen) and spleens (dissected on-orbit and preserved in RNAlater) had RIN values, >6.5 and >7.6, respectively (Fig. 8B). RNA extracted from liver tissues dissected from the frozen carcasses of Validation FLT mice had RIN values > 6.5 (Fig. 8C). Figure 8. Open in a new tab RNA quality from from livers and spleens dissected on-orbit and/or from frozen carcasses. RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN) were determined to assess RNA quality as described in methods. RNA was extracted from livers and spleens of (A) Experimental mice and (B) Validation mice that were dissected and preserved on-orbit (or on the ground) as described in Methods. (C) RNA was extracted from livers that were dissected from Validation carcasses that had been frozen intact on-orbit (or on the ground) and stored at −80C until the time of dissection. N values are indicated for each group.Liver gene expression analysis (validation mice) To begin to assess gene expression in samples recovered from frozen carcasses (FC, n = 5/group) and on-orbit dissected tissue (OoD, n = 2/group), total RNA was analyzed by RTqPCR for expression of 12 liver-associated genes: Hmgcr, Cat, Gsr, Serpina1e, Cdkn1a, Chka, Pnpla3, Tef, Snd1, Nr4a1, Nox4, and Taf. These specific genes were selected for analysis on the basis of prior spaceflight findings26,27 and preliminary bioinformatics of RNAsequencing results (Homer Fogle and Jonathan Galazka, personal communication). In frozen carcasses, expression of Gsr, Cdkn1a, and Chka were elevated in FLT mice compared with GC mice, and Tef expression was reduced as a result of spaceflight (Supplementary Fig. S3). Patterns of relative gene expression in samples recovered from frozen carcasses of FLT vs GC mice from the Validation study did not appear to be the same in samples recovered from on orbit dissected tissues. Although the small sample size from on orbit dissected tissues precludes drawing definitive conclusions, these prelimary results indicate that the method of sample recovery may have affected RTqPCR results obtained.Discussion The main objective of this work was to develop new capability for conducting long duration, rodent experiments in space which both minimize the complications of non-specific, chronic stress responses and allow for sample recovery on-orbit, thereby avoiding the confounding variables associated with returning to Earth. All animals were healthy throughout the duration of the mission as evidenced by daily video health checks, maintenance of body weights compared with ground controls, and an absence of immune organ atrophy (thymus, spleen) or adrenal hypertrophy relative to ground controls. As expected, the mass of the soleus, consisting predominantly of type I muscle fibers which typically atrophy with disuse, was significantly lower in Validation FLT mice than in GC mice housed in the flight hardware (Fig. 6), whereas other muscles did not. Further, we found that all of the forms of tissue collection/preservation tested (on-orbit dissection followed by freezing, preservation in RNAlater, or freezing carcasses on-orbit followed by dissecting tissues and organs from frozen carcasses after they were returned to Earth) provided samples with high enough quality for molecular analyses, although the tissue collection/preservation methods may have affected results obtained. Taken together, these results demonstrate a new capability for long duration experimentation with on-orbit sample recovery. Body weight is considered a sensitive indicator for monitoring animal health. We found Validation FLT mice had similar body mass as a consequence of spaceflight when compared to GC and Viv mice (Fig. 4). This finding is in contrast to previous reports from numerous rodent spaceflight experiments28. Some previous spaceflight experiments have on occasion shown that spaceflight can lead to reduced body weights compared to baseline values and ground controls29,30, complicating interpretation of the results obtained. If the body weight loss is due to persistent stress response entailing activation of the HPA (hypothalamic, pituitary and adrenal) axis, then it can be difficult to distinguish between effects of reduced gravity-dependent loading in space vs. endocrine stress. These findings, together with similar findings from tissue weights of adrenal gland, thymus and spleen and behavioral observations, are consistent with the interpretation that habitation on-orbit did not provoke a chronic stress response. Both the Validation and Experimental FLT mice engaged in more active behaviors than their respective GC mice (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S1). This finding was surprising but consistent with a recent report that simulated weightlessness (14d) also leads to increased locomotion relative to ambulatory controls after a transient initial period of reduced motor activity31. Furthermore, the Validation FLT mice exhibited a rapid, repetitive running behavior, which was not observed in the Experimental mice (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1). This difference in behavior between the cohorts was likely due to their age differences (the Validation mice were 16-weeks old at launch, whereas the Experimental mice were 32-weeks at launch). A detailed behavioral analysis from this mission can be found in Ronca, et al.18. Atrophy of the slow-twitch soleus muscle, which provides postural support during mechanical loading, occurs as a consequence of spaceflight in rodents12,32. Consistent with previous studies, we observed a ~19% decrement in soleus weight in Validation FLT mice compared to GC (Fig. 6), but no differences in the EDL. Despite previously reported atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscle due to microgravity12,29,30,33, no difference in gastrocnemius mass was observed in Validation FLT versus GC mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). The lack of atrophy in the gastrocnemius was especially surprising since C57BL/6 female mice (9 weeks old at launch) utilized in previous space shuttle experiments29,30 housed in very similar hardware to that used in this study, showed significant atrophy of gastrocnemious, soleus and tibialis anterior. Interestingly, these mice were shown to lose body mass with spaceflight compared with basal controls despite their relatively young age and expected growth pattern. A possible explanation for the differences in gastrocnemius findings between these previous space shuttle investigations29,30 and the current study is that young, growing mice at time of launch may be more sensitive to spaceflight effects than older (Validation) mice. Alternatively, perhaps mice are less active during initial exposure to spaceflight, leading to muscle atrophy, and then become more active over time, which in fact was found to be the case by Ronca et al.18. In a longer duration experiment such as Validation RR-1, indices of atrophy may reverse. In any case, the finding that there was reduced soleus muscle mass in the Validation FLT mice, as well as the Experimental FLT mice14 was consistent with expected findings of slow-twitch muscle atrophy due to long duration spaceflight. With respect to organ weights, thymus glands and livers were significantly heavier in FLT mice compared with GC mice (Fig. 5) whereas spleen weights did not differ. Typically, shorter duration experiments than the Validation study show that spaceflight causes atrophy of the immune organs, which is often attributed to an endocrine stress response, although direct effects of microgravity on immune cells in vitro also occur34. The greater thymus weights observed in FLT animals relative to GC contrasts to observations from previous, short and long term missions27,35–37, but is consistent with findings from other spaceflight experiments. Unlike previous missions, tissues from mice analyzed in the present study were preserved on-orbit, and therefore the animals did not endure the added challenges of a return flight to Earth and ambulation, which can potentially affect gene expression as well as soft tissue weights38. Livers from Validation FLT mice had a 33% greater mass than GC controls (when normalized to body weights), a finding consistent with only some prior spaceflight studies27. Jonscher et al.39 reported increased accumulation of hepatic lipid droplets and increased total triglycerides in spaceflight mice livers compared with livers from GC mice and Blaber et al. describe impaired oxidative defence pathways due to spaceflight26. Early, short duration rat spaceflight experiments showed that spaceflight increased hepatic lipid peroxidation, altered enzyme protein levels40,41, and together with later studies, led to the proposal that spaceflight leads to pathological changes consistent with the eventual development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with long duration spaceflight39. The relevance of spaceflight-induced liver toxicity in rodents to human astronauts remains uncertain. Unlike musculoskeletal and immune effects of spaceflight which are observed in both humans and rodents, to our knowledge there have been no reports showing direct evidence that liver function is altered in astronauts during missions lasting up to one year. In Validation mice, spaceflight increased activity levels of GSR and GAPDH, relative to cage-matched GC. GSR plays a critical role in resisting oxidative stress and spaceflight can induce ROS-related activity27,42. Our findings that GSR activity levels were elevated in FLT mice relative to GC contrasts to those of Hollander et al.43, who shows reduced hepatic GSR activity in rats after an 8d flight along with a decline in other antioxidant enzymes and increased malondialdehyde, consistent with a state of oxidative stress. The differences in GSR activity between Validation (33d on-orbit) versus Experimental (17–18d on-orbit) mice, as well as rats (8d)43, may be due in part to the length of spaceflight exposure although other explanations certainly are possible (e.g., age). GAPDH plays a principal role in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Although GAPDH is commonly considered a housekeeping gene and applied as a control for gene or protein expression levels, it is in fact a redox-sensitive protein regulated at the transcriptional level by insulin and hypoxia44 and also in the liver during periods of nutritional insufficiency45. Further, short duration shuttle missions lead to reduced rather than elevated expression of glycolysis-related genes in the liver46. Together, these findings suggest time-dependent regulation of oxidative defense and glycolytic pathways during spaceflight, which will require further study in future time-course experiments. Enzymatic activity can be a good indicator of the protein quality following collection and preservation, and therefore, we measured activity levels of select enzymes from livers dissected and frozen on-orbit by astronauts and those dissected from frozen carcasses after return to Earth in comparison to control samples collected on Earth (positive controls). GC sample collection and storage was conducted to duplicate the on-orbit procedures (including dissection timing, preservation and storage) with the highest fidelity possible. Enzyme activities from livers of Experimental FLT mice that were dissected and preserved on-orbit and from livers of GC mice, were similar to those of samples prepared under optimal laboratory conditions, as well as protocols for GC sample collection and storage that were specifically planned to duplicate on-orbit procedures, including dissection timing and preservation. The RNA extracted from livers that were dissected then immediately frozen on-orbit were compared with those dissected from the frozen carcasses. RNA from livers, either freshly dissected or from carcasses, exhibited RIN values that exceeded 6.5 (Fig. 8). RIN values for spleens that were dissected then preserved in RNAlater (Fig. 8C) exceeded >7.5. RNA recovered from frozen spleens in preflight experiments consistently yielded RNA with very low RIN values, possibly due to higher RNase expression in this organ (results not shown); therefore this approach for sample recovery was not used on the flight samples. Taken together, findings from the liver tissue indicate that both methods of spaceflight tissue preservation were sufficient to yield RNA with RIN values generally considered adequate for most molecular analyses although possible differences in patterns of gene expression assessed by RTqPCR require further evaluation to determine if recovery from frozen carcasses yields unreliable results, perhaps due to warm ischemia47 in liver samples recovered from the carcasses (Supplementary Fig. 3). Studies are in progress to further assess this possibility. Conducting spaceflight experiments presents unique challenges to making rapid progress in understanding the biological responses of rodents to microgravity. Not the least of these challenges is ensuring that control animals on Earth are provided a physical environment that replicates the environment on the spacecraft to the greatest extent possible. One limit of this study, as opposed to some prior spaceflight missions48–50 is that ground controls were not subjected to the vibration, acceleration and noise stimuli which is unavoidable during launch of rodents into space. This was due to logistical and cost limitations imposed on this system. We reasoned, though, that because the system was intended to support long duration experiments, the effects of transient stressors associated with launch would diminish by the time of sample recovery. Further study is needed to justify this expectation, especially for those tissue responses which are most likely to be sensitive to the stress of launch. Further, unique habitats and environmental control systems must be devised to adequately support both FLT and GC animals. The hardware developed to transport and house the mice did in fact display differences; we found GC values for several parameters were different than Viv, as others also have found using the heritage habitat, AEM, on Shuttle missions (e.g.43,51). While comparison of FLT mice to the cage-matched GC group is clearly of greatest relevance for determining the influence of spaceflight, the Viv control group is also useful for comparing results obtained in a given spaceflight experiment to standard housing conditions in investigators’ home institutions. In conclusion, on the basis of our findings and those of others, we propose that physiological accommodation to the spaceflight environment entails at least a two-phase process. An initial acute (<2–3 wk) phase yields rapid and pronounced differences in tissue biology, which are likely to be dynamic, transient, and sensitive to the acute psychological and physical stress of launch, and adaptation to the novel microgravity environment. Evidence for an early, transient phase of adaptation is based on findings from previous spaceflight experiments that often show spaceflight causes decrements in body mass, immune organ atrophy, and indices of HPA axis activation after missions lasting less than 3 wk12,28–30,52,53. We suggest a second, long duration (>2–3 wk) phase follows when the animals have acclimated to reduced loading microgravity; our findings that body weights, immune organ mass and adrenal mass were not lower in Validation spaceflight mice compared to ground controls or basal groups support this proposal. Return to earth would be expected to introduce a new phase when the effects of gravity-dependent loading exceeds the new steady-state achieved during residence in microgravity. Since the first mission described here, the hardware system and operations for this project were developed further to support return to Earth of living animals, enabling study of the entire cycle of long duration space travel. Although there are individual variabilities, similar phases of adaptation to spaceflight are seen in crew members.Methods Hardware description and performance The Rodent Research Transporter and Habitats performed as expected for the duration of the flight. There were no interruptions in power, lighting, airflow, or the delivery of food and water throughout the duration of the mission. Lights were programmed on a 12:12 hr light/dark cycle (6:00–18:00 GMT, lights on) and enough food and water was provided so that replenishment was not required for the duration of this mission. Temperature, humidity and gas levels varied within the compartments of the Transporter and Habitat along with the ISS cabin environment due to active air exchanges between the ISS cabin and inside the Habitat (~ 0.3 m/s). In the U.S. Lab portion of the ISS where habitats were located, CO2 ranged from 788–4690 ppm, temperature from 21.3–24.1 °C, and humidity from 32–58% during the in-flight phase of the experiment (Sept 25 – Oct 31, 2014). Within the Habitat, sensor readings ranged from 26.3–28 C for Experimental Flight Habitats and 27.0–27.9 C for Experimental GC Habitats. The average temperatures were 26.0 °C and 26.4 °C for Experimental Flight and GC Habitats, respectively. The Validation and Experimental Habitats on the ISS were located in different racks that housed and powered the hardware (EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments for Space Station (EXPRESS) racks). The Validation Habitat was consistently observed to be 0.6–2.3 °C warmer than the Experimental Habitat due to differences in the local air temperature in front of the EXPRESS racks. Nonetheless, all parameters fell within the requirements for animal welfare that were set prior to the mission. The Validation and Experimental GC mice were housed in Habitats that were placed in an ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ISSES chambers were programmed on a 4-day delay using telemetry data from ISS to closely match the temperature, humidity, and CO2 partial pressure in the FLT Habitats to ensure that the GC animals on Earth were exposed to the same environmental parameters as the flight animals on-orbit, while the Validation Viv mice were housed continuously in a standard animal facility at KSC. Transporter (Supplementary Fig. S4A): The Transporter provides for the transport of rodents on the commercial resupply service vehicle (SpaceX Dragon for this mission), both to and from the ISS. The Transporter was tested pre-flight in a series of ground-based experiments and shown to successfully house and provide life support for 20 mice (10 mice per side), which is twice the density compared to the Habitats, for up to 10 days during the ascent to the ISS or during the descent back to Earth. During transport, the Transporters were connected to the life support system provided by the Dragon vehicle. During transportation to the ISS, the animals could not be viewed or checked until they were transferred from the Transporter to the Habitats on-board the ISS by crewmembers. External sensors attached to the Transporter and Dragon recorded the environmental data during transport to and from the ISS. Habitat: The rodent Habitat was modified from heritage flight hardware (AEM) to provide long-term housing for rodents aboard the ISS (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Differences between the AEM, developed and used for short-term Space Shuttle missions, and the Habitat include long duration and secondary exhaust filters, water refill capability, and the addition of four video cameras (Supercircuits, Austin, TX) to monitor daily activity and animals’ health and behavior. Two color cameras with wide angle lens and two black and white cameras with pinhole lens are located in the filter and lixit areas, respectively. A brief description of the different types of animal flight hardware to date is described in Table 1. Foodbars (~850 g) developed specifically for the flight hardware54 were mounted onto a metal plate (two plates per Habitat, one plate per side) and approximately 2 liters of deionized autoclaved water supplemented with 4 ppm iodine (to prevent microbial growth) were installed into each Habitat. Water bags were filled and installed in the Habitats at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) before Habitats were launched to ISS without animals. Once on-orbit, the crew members connected the Habitats to power source, installed them in EXPRESS Racks and ran a verification to ensure that telemetry (temperature, CO2, %RH), video downlink from cameras, lights, and fans are functional prior to animal transfer. Food bar plates were inserted in the Habitats prior to animal transfer on-orbit. Additionally, the Habitat allows for water refills on-orbit to support long-duration missions of more than 30 days (although water was not refilled during the mission described here). Videos recorded from the Habitat cameras were used to assess animal health and behavior including sleeping, eating, drinking, grooming, and ambulating. The Habitat also contained sensors to detect humidity and temperature. For this mission, no additional form of enrichment was provided to the animals. Animal Access Unit (AAU, Supplementary Fig. S4C): This unit attaches to both the Transporter and Habitat to safely access the animals during transfer between the two and for science operations, preventing escape of animal waste into the cabin environment. Mouse Transfer Box (MTB, Supplementary Fig. S4D): A lexan box with a 2-door lid was created to hold and securely transfer up to 5 animals at a time between the Transporter and Habitat, and Habitat and Microgravity Science Glovebox, which is an experimental hood located on the ISS, that was used to euthanize the animals and dissect their tissues on-orbit.Pre-flight testing of rodent research hardware Although the AEM has been successfully flown 27 times on the US Space Shuttles over the past 50 years, the Rodent Habitat has been developed by adding multiple new features as described above. Therefore, a series of ground-based tests were performed using a protocol similar to those for spaceflight (with the exception of the microgravity factor) to ensure that the Habitat could support a long-duration mission on the ISS. Launch simulation test A Launch Simulation Test (LST) was conducted to determine if the Transporter would maintain the health and well-being of mice when subjected to the SpaceX Dragon launch profile (random vibration and steady state acceleration). To do this, female C57BL/6J (14 weeks old) mice from Jackson Lab were subjected to vibration followed by centrifugation while in the Transporter to simulate the launch profile of the Dragon. For the LST the mice first were housed in the Transporter at a density of 20 mice per Transporter (10 mice per side) for 10 days to simulate the longest expected time of the transient phase between animal loading prior to launch and animal transfer on the ISS to the Habitats. At the end of the LST the mice were checked by the attending veterinarian and deemed to be healthy and suitable for experimental research. The LST was followed by a biocompatibility test in which the mice were housed in the Habitats for 32 days, similar to what was described previously for a group of young, male mice subjected to segmented bone defects55. For this study, a subset of mice were subject to hindlimb unloading (HU)56 immediately after the launch simulation test to evaluate any adverse health effects on the mice due to the sequential stressors of launch simulation and weightlessness in simulated microgravity.Rodent habitat biocompatibility test Two separate biocompatibility tests of different duration (e.g. 32 and 91 days) were performed with the Habitats to determine the length of time the Habitat can support animal health. The following was evaluated throughout the test: stability of the fans, cameras, and telemetry sensors, performance and saturation of the filters, waste buildup, and most importantly, long-term animal health and well-being. The data showed that the Habitat supported 10 female, 16 wk old C57BL/6J female mice for 32 days during the first test; there were no significant differences in body weights nor the weights of the organs that are known to respond to chronic stress (e.g. adrenal glands, thymus, and spleen) between the animals housed in standard vivarium cages and those housed in Rodent Habitats. The animals were checked by the NASA Attending Veterinarian and deemed to be healthy and suitable for science. This test was conducted using the same protocol as the RR-1 experiment described here, including the animal acclimation and daily health checks. To assess if the Habitat can support the animals’ health and well-being for as long as 3 months, a biocompatibility test was conducted for 91 days, comparing mice housed in the Habitat continuously to mice housed in standard, shoebox cages (i.e. vivarium). The test revealed that the hardware performed as expected to support animal health (data not shown).Preflight preparation and transit to ISS Pre-flight training of astronaut crew Two United States Orbital Segment (USOS) crew members were trained by certified trainers in the 2-day Rodent Generic Skills class at Johnson Space Center (JSC), where they practiced and were certified for animal handling and gross dissection skills with multiple animals. The crewmembers also were trained in animal handling, euthanasia, and mission specific dissection skills using flight-like kits for tissue preservation and the Rodent Research hardware. They also received training on how to conduct a health assessment of the animals. The first priority of the training was to ensure humane animal handling and euthanasia.Animals All animal procedures performed in these experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for flight at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and the methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Twelve-week old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Wild type C57BL/6NTac mice and MuRF1 (muscle RING finger protein 1) knockout (KO) mice that were generated on C57BL/6NTac background were purchased from Taconic Biosciences (Rensselaer, NY) for the Experimental cohorts, respectively. All the mice were implanted with IMI-1000 2 × 11 mm transponders (Biomedic Data Systems, Seaford, DE) prior to shipping, and were examined by the animal care facility (ACF) veterinarian staff upon arrival at KSC. Fecal samples were collected at 2 different time points: upon receipt at KSC and 11 days before turnover for launch, analyzed by Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) to verify that they are free from microorganisms before launch. The mice were housed in standard vivarium cages at a density of 5 mice per cage. The animals were provided with standard bedding, diet (LabDiet Rodent 5001), and deionized autoclaved water ad libitum, maintained on a 12 hr:12 hr dark/light cycle (6:00–18:00 GMT, lights on), and checked daily by the KSC and ARC staff. During the pre-flight period, body weight, food depletion, and water consumption data were collected and recorded twice a week. Animal identification and body weight measurements were collected and recorded using the Data Acquisition System (DAS-8001) and Smart Probe (SP-6004) (Bio Medic Data Systems) in conjunction with the top-loading balance (AC3102CU, OHAUS).Animal pre-flight acclimation, group assignment, and flight preparation Four days after arriving at KSC, the Validation animals were gradually acclimated to the foodbars and hardware. Twenty-two days before launch (L-22d), the mice were introduced to the NASA Type 12 Nutrient upgraded rodent foodbars (NuRFB)54, and at L-18d to deionized, autoclaved water via water bottles outfitted with lixits. At L-12d the mice were introduced to raised wire floors and regrouped based on their body weights, and placed at double density (10 mice per cage). Mouse Igloos (VWR, Radnor, PA) were provided to the mice for enrichment. Food and water depletion was measured, via weight changes, every 3–4 days after mice were placed at double density. Note that since foodbars crumble and fall through the wire cage grid walls during consumption, their measured weights do not accurately reflect total consumption. Similarly, Experimental mice were received at KSC at L-10 weeks (and not provided igloos as enrichment), placed on lixits, food bars and raised wire floors at L-23 days, and combined to double density at L-12 days. Loading and turnover was L-2 days.Animal selection At L-6d, three cages of the Validation mice (10 mice per cage) were selected based on similar body weights to be the Spaceflight (FLT), Ground control (GC), and Vivarium control (Viv) groups for the Validation experiment. The animals were examined by the attending veterinarian and were deemed to be healthy and suitable for the flight experiment. Experimental mice were similarly weight matched into Basal, FLT and GC groups and assessed by the AV. From these 3 groups, at L-3d, the FLT group animals were assigned based on their health and body weights. At L-2d, the FLT mice (16 weeks and 32 weeks of age for Validation and Experimental groups, respectively) were loaded into the Transporter and turned over to SpaceX for launch. The animal loading was originally scheduled to occur at L-25 hours, but due to a launch slip of ~24 hours, the mice were housed for 2 days in the Transporter prior to launch. During this time, the Transporter remained in the Dragon capsule on the launch pad.Animal load and turnover for launch The Transporters containing the FLT mice were driven to the launch pad in a temperature controlled van then turned over to SpaceX to be installed in the Dragon capsule for launch. Between turnover and loading into the SpaceX Dragon Capsule, the Transporters were connected to a power supply and kept in an air-conditioned van or room in a SpaceX facility. Data collected from sensors attached to the outside of the transporter confirmed that temperature and humidity remained within acceptable range. Once the Transporters were installed and Dragon capsule hatch closed, life support and environmental control was provided by the SpaceX Dragon. Due to a one day launch delay, the animals remained in the Transporters for two days prior to launch. To prepare for launch, the Dragon capsule atop the Falcon9 rocket transitioned from horizontal to vertical position. This rotation was replicated on the ground control Transporters. Dragon is unmanned and there is no video capability in the Transporter. As such, there were no health checks performed while animals were in the Transporter during ascent. The Dragon environmental control and life support system maintained the atmosphere within acceptable limits for pressure, temperature (65–85°F), relative humidity (25–75%), oxygen (19–23%), and carbon dioxide (≤6000 ppm). Later analysis of sensors installed in Dragon cabin confirmed that environmental conditions remained within allowable ranges.On-orbit animal operations Four days after launch (L + 4d), mice were transferred by astronauts from the Transporter to the Habitats on the ISS. As the animals were being transferred, the crew and the Attending Veterinarian (via real-time telemetry from an over-the-shoulder camera) examined the animals. All mice were deemed healthy, and they were housed at a density of 10 mice per Habitat, 5 mice per side. While on-board the ISS, animal health checks were performed daily as described below. Of the 10 Experimental mice, results from only 5 WT are reported here; muscle responses for all the Experimental mice are reported by Cadena et al.14. Experimental mice were processed on the 17th (L + 21d, 5 mice) and 18th (L + 22d, 5 mice) days after animal transfer on the ISS. On these days, the mice were removed from their Habitats and brought to the MSG for handling and dissection using ventilated Mouse Transfer Boxes (MTB, Supplementary Fig. S4D). The animals were subsequently euthanized via intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Euthasol (Virbac, Fort Worth, TX) diluted with sterile saline (1:1) at 1.72 mg/kg followed by cervical dislocation then processed in the MSG on-orbit. The right hindlimb was dissected from 10 mice. The liver and spleen were collected from 5 wild-type mice and frozen at ≤−80 °C in a flight freezer (the Minus Eighty degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS, MELFI) or preserved in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 4 °C for 2 days then frozen and stored at ≤−80 °C, respectively. On the 33rd day after the animals were transferred to Habitats on the ISS (37 days after launch), 10 Validation mice were euthanized via IP injection of Euthasol (1.72 mg/kg) followed by cervical dislocation then processed in the MSG. Two of the 10 mice were dissected immediately after euthanasia to recover livers and spleens on the ISS. Livers were then stored at ≤−80 °C in the (≤−80 °C) Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer (MELFI). Spleens were dissected and preserved in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 4 °C for about 2 days and then transferred to the MELFI for freezing and storage until return to Earth. The remaining 8 non-dissected Validation mice carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, put in Ziploc bags and stored in the MELFI (≤−80 °C). Livers and carcasses were placed in cold stowage containers that were prechilled to −130 °C to freeze the livers and carcasses in the MSG prior to transfer and storage in the MELFI. Since only 2 of the 10 Validation mice were dissected for livers and spleens on the ISS due to crew time constraints, the liver and spleen samples dissected from 5 wild-type ISS National Lab Experimental mice were provided to NASA for post-flight analysis to increase the sample size (Fig. 2B). The Flight Attending Veterinarian was in attendance for all on-orbit euthanasia and dissection procedures and was able to visualize and communicate with the crew via real-time video and voice loop. Each individual animal was examined and noted to be in good condition prior to euthanasia. The dissection procedures were successfully completed on all mice.Baseline controls (Basal) For both the Experimental and Validation studies, 10 baseline mice matched by pre-launch body weights to Viv, FLT and GC were housed in standard mouse cages, 5 mice per shoebox cage (11.5″ × 7.5″″ × 5″, catalog 100272 F, Lab Products, Seaford, DE) with one Igloo per cage for enrichment and maintained in an animal holding room at the KSC ACF. The mice were euthanized and processed one day after launch according to the same protocol as their respective FLT mice.Ground controls (GCs) Mice selected for GCs were housed in the Rodent hardware (Transporter and Habitats) and treated as similarly as possible to FLT animals. All procedures were off-set by a 4-day delayed schedule so that environments could be set to match telemetry data received from the ISS. Thus, GC mice were loaded into the Transporter at L + 1d. Just prior to animal loading, the mice were checked by the KSC Attending Veterinarian, and they were deemed healthy and suitable for science. The Transporter was kept in the ISSES to simulate the same environmental conditions the FLT animals were exposed to. After 4 days inside the Transporter, the Validation and Experimental GC mice were evaluated by the KSC ACF veterinarian staff and then transferred to the Habitats, where they were housed at a density of 10 mice per Habitat, 5 mice per side. The Habitats, containing the Experimental and Validation GC mice, were maintained in the ISSES for 17–18 and 33 days, respectively, under the same environmental conditions as the FLT mice. The Experimental and Validation GC mice were dissected and processed using the same timelines (off-set by 4 days) and protocols as their respective FLT mice.Vivarium controls (Viv) The Validation mice selected for the Viv group were housed in standard mouse cages, 5 mice per shoebox cage with one Igloo per cage for enrichment and maintained in an animal holding room at the KSC ACF. The KSC ACF veterinary staff performed health checks daily, and weighed the mice, food, and water twice weekly and their food and water were replaced once weekly. The Validation Viv mice were dissected and processed using the same timelines and protocols as their respective FLT and GC mice.Video health checks Daily health checks were performed for Experimental and Validation FLT and GC animals (health assessments were performed on Viv animals as described in the Vivarium control section above) by trained ground personnel beginning one day after the animals were transferred from the Transporter to the Habitats (GMT 269, September 26, 2014). Initially, 2 hours of video (one hour each during the light and dark cycles) were recorded from each Habitat. Two cameras were located in each side of the Habitat - one near the lixits and the other near the filter. These videos were downlinked to Ames Research Center (ARC, Moffett Field, CA) via Marshal Flight Space Center (MFSC, Huntsville, AL), and animal health checks were performed by observing and documenting the health and behaviors of the animals for 1 hour during the light cycle and 1 hour during the dark cycle, daily from each Habitat. However, due to thermal issues experienced with this recording schedule, the video health checks for the Validation mice were shortened to approximately 15 minutes. Starting on Oct 10, 2014 (GMT 283), the health checks during the light cycle were discontinued with concurrence from the Institutional Animal Care And Use Committee (IACUC) and for the remainder of the mission, real-time health checks were performed during the dark cycle only. Animal health check forms were used to record daily observations of the following: Habitat ID, Habitat Side, Camera position, Health Status, GMT time/date, number of animals observed, animal cycle, and animal behaviors (drinking, eating, grooming, ambulation, etc.). Animal activity was recorded during the health check on a scale of 1–3 based on different behaviors as described in Fig. 3A. To further evaluate animal behavior on-orbit, one 24-hour video monitoring session was performed in which the animals were observed for 10 minutes every hour.Radiation exposure The RR-1 Validation mice were exposed to radiation for 37 days (4 days in transit and 33 days on the ISS). The dosimetry mapping of radiation levels across the U.S. Lab indicated that during the 37 day period the daily dose was approximately 207 μGy/day and the total dose recorded by an instrument in the U.S. lab was 7.377 mGy. This range falls within expected and allowable radation doses. In addition, the Rodent Habitats were inside a locker and inserted into the EXPRESS racks, which provided additional shielding to the mice. Radiation doses during transit to the ISS were not determined; however, since the mice remained inside the radiation belts during transit, we estimated that the dose rate during transit was approximately the same as while on board the ISS, which would be 0.6 to 0.9 mGy during transit.Food and water depletion To provide an estimate of water and food consumption for comparison between FLT and control groups, foodbars and water boxes from their respective cages were weighed before launch and after return to Earth. Since the mice may drain some water from the lixits and cause foodbars to crumble without being consumed, results are reported as food and water depletion (rather than consumption) and normalized to the number of mice in each compartment per day (n = 2 measurements/group).Post-flight sample return and processing Experimental and Validation FLT frozen tissues, carcasses, and remaining food and water were returned to Earth 12–13 and 105 days after dissection, respectively, and all frozen samples were kept at ≤−70 °C during transport. All Experimental and Validation Basal, GC, and Viv (Validation only) frozen tissue samples and carcasses were shipped from KSC to ARC on dry ice then stored at −80 °C until they were processed about 4 months later. Frozen carcasses of the Validation mice were weighed upon receipt at ARC, and the body weights of the 8 non-dissected mice from each group were compared to their respective weights at L-3 days. Tests performed prior to launch had confirmed that the long term freezing and partial thawing procedure did not affect measured body weights (data not shown). After brief (~5 min), partial thawing at room temperature, disection was initiated for the following organs until all tissues were complete about ~35–45 min after removal from the freezer. Immeidately after dissections, tissues and were weighed, and then preserved by storing in RNAlater: gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus(EDL), quadriceps, liver (part of the liver was also frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at −80 °C to be used in enzyme activity assays described below), spleen, thymus, and adrenal glands. Additionally, 3 mice that were the same sex, strain, and age as the Validation mice (female C57BL/6J, ~21 weeks at time of euthanasia) were euthanized by IP injection with Euthasol followed by cervical dislocation, then select tissues were dissected and prepared in the same manner as the Validation mice except under optimal laboratory conditions, i.e. aliquots of livers were immediately frozen post-dissection in liquid nitrogen for the enzyme assays, and spleens and aliquots of livers were immediately preserved in RNAlater, to serve as a positive control for tissue quality. Tissues were stored at −80 °C immediately after freezing in liquid nitrogen, and tissues preserved in RNAlater were kept at 4 °C for 2 days then frozen and stored at −80 °C.RNA isolation and evaluation RNA was extracted from the spleen and liver tissue samples from Validation Basal, Viv, GC, FLT, and positive control (PC) mice, and from the ISS National Lab 5 wildtype mice using TRIzol reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The RNA samples were then treated with DNase I incubation mix (2.727 Kunitz units/uL; RNase-free DNase kit, Qiagen Catalogue #79254), and RNA concentration and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was determined by measuring the RNA integrity number (RIN) using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), where a RIN of 10 is considered intact and 0 totally degraded RNA. The analysis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The total RNA extracted for each tissue sample was converted to cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog # 4368814) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. TaqMan Gene Expression Assay primer and probe sets (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for real-time, quantitative PCR (RTqPCR) analysis of Hmgcr (Mm01282491_g1), Rpl19 (Mm02601633_g1), Gapdh (Mm99999915_g1), Cat (Mm00437992_m1), Gsr (Mm00439154_m1), Serpina1e (Mm00833655_m1), Cdkn1a (Mm00432448_m1), Chka (Mm00442759_m1), Pnpla3 (Mm00504420_m1), Tef (Mm00457513_m1), Snd1 (Mm00490722_m1), Nr4a1 (Mm01300401_m1), Nox4 (Mm00479246_m1), and Taf3 (Mm01337577_m1). RTqPCR analyses were carried out using 20 ng of cDNA on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog #4485694). Gene expression in liver samples was normalized to the Rpl19 (all but Cat) or Gapdh (Cat) endogenous reference genes. All data are expressed as 2−(Ct(target)-Ct(endogenous reference)).Liver enzyme activity assays Protein was extracted from an aliquot of each liver sample from Basal, GC, and FLT Experimental mice (n = 5 from each group), and from Basal, Viv, GC, and FLT Validation mice (n = 2 for the tissues that were dissected either on the ground or on-orbit then frozen; and n = 5 (out of 8) for the samples that were dissected from frozen carcasses from each group), as well as their respective positive controls (n = 5 for Experimental control and n = 3 for Validation control). Activities of three enzymes were determined using the method previously described57. Briefly, catalase activity was measured using the colorimetric assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI), and normalized to total protein levels (Thermo Scientific™ Pierce™ Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Kit, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Catalase protein levels were measured using the Catalase Human ELISA Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and specific activity of the enzyme was calculated (U/μg catalase protein). GSR activity levels were determined using the GSR Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and GAPDH activity levels were determined using the colorimetric GAPDH assay kit (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA).Statistical analysis Statistical significance was determined by comparing 4 and 3 groups from the same cohorts for the Validation and Experimental study, respectively; for the Validation mice, these included the FLT, GC, VIV and Basal groups and for Experimental mice these included FLT, GC and Basal groups. For Validation mice, uniformity of variance was tested by Levene’s test and normality goodness of fit by Shapiro-Wilk. One-factor ANOVA was then applied to the data, and if the main effect showed P < 0.05, was followed by a Tukey-Kramer HSD post hoc analysis. The sole exception to application of ANOVA was Validation liver catalase activity, which did not display normal distribution. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to Validation catalase results. P < 0.05 was accepted as significant. All data shown are mean +/− S.D. Data analyses were performed using JMP13.1 (SAS).Supplementary information Supplementary information.

    "abstract": "Abstract The mechanisms triggering disuse muscle atrophy remain of debate. It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling muscle mass. We have recently shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in disuse atrophy of soleus, a slow, oxidative muscle. Here we tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction in fast muscles too, notwithstanding their much lower mitochondrial content. Gastrocnemius displayed atrophy following both 3 and 7 days of unloading. SOD1 and catalase up-regulation, no H2O2 accumulation and no increase of protein carbonylation suggest the antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted to redox imbalance in the early phases of disuse. A defective mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 down-regulation) occurred together with an impairment of OXPHOS capacity. Furthermore, at 3 days of unloading higher acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation was found, suggesting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. To test the role of mitochondrial alterations we used Tg-mice overexpressing PGC-1α because of the known effect of PGC-1α on stimulation of Mfn2 expression. PGC-α overexpression was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway, (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and of authopagic factors, and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse. As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity were sustained throughout disuse, compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy also in fast muscles.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The molecular mechanisms that govern the imbalance between pathways controlling protein synthesis and degradation in disuse muscle atrophy remain unclear, notwithstanding the large amount of work done (Bonaldo & Sandri, 2013). Investigations of multiple models of disuse in animals have shown an up-regulation of genes related to protein degradation and stress response as well as a down-regulation of those related to transcription and translation, and energy metabolism (Lecker et al. 2004; Bodine, 2013). Debate is ongoing regarding whether and to what extent redox signalling can actually be the trigger of such phenomena (Pellegrino et al. 2011a,b; Powers et al. 2012). A growing body of evidence challenges oxidative stress as a trigger of disuse atrophy (Ikemoto et al. 2002; Koesterer et al. 2002; Servais et al. 2007; Brocca et al. 2010; Desaphy et al. 2010; Glover et al. 2010; Kuwahara et al. 2010; Pellegrino et al. 2011b; Powers et al. 2012; Cannavino et al. 2014). We have recently reported that, in soleus muscle, notwithstanding an early persistent redox imbalance, a metabolic programme controlling muscle mass, rather than oxidative stress, played a major role in triggering hindlimb unloading (HU) muscle atrophy. A down-regulation of peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) expression and protein content was, in fact, shown to activate catabolic systems by promoting ubiquitin ligase and autophagy gene expression through FoxO3 disinhibition (Cannavino et al. 2014). Although most studies on mice have focused on the anti-gravitary, slow soleus muscle as it is preferentially affected by disuse atrophy, several fast muscles (including gastrocnemius) go through a significant loss of mass following unloading (Kyparos et al. 2005; Brocca et al. 2010; Desaphy et al. 2010). As fast muscles in mice have mostly a glycolytic metabolism and express low levels of PGC-1 (Lin et al. 2002), the metabolic programme supporting disuse-induced muscle mass loss in soleus might not be relevant in fast muscles. Data regarding PGC-1α during disuse in fast muscles are inconsistent: increases (Wagatsuma et al. 2011), decreases (Mazzatti et al. 2008) as well as no change (Nagatomo et al. 2011) of PGC-1α levels have been reported. However, alterations of mitochondrial biogenesis (Liu et al. 2012b), mitochondrial respiration (Yajid et al. 1998) and mitochondrial dynamics (Wagatsuma et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2012b) have been shown after prolonged unloading in fast muscles. Moreover, in our previous study we demonstrated that antioxidant treatment during unloading did not prevent gastrocnemius atrophy, suggesting that oxidative stress is not the major cause of disuse atrophy also in fast muscle (Brocca et al. 2010). A recent report has highlighted the importance of mitochondrial dynamics in cell and animal physiology. Mitochondria constantly fuse and divide, and an imbalance of these two processes dramatically alters overall mitochondrial morphology and function (Chen & Chan, 2005). Mitochondrial fusion and fission have emerged as important processes that govern mitochondrial function (Detmer & Chan, 2007; Hoppins et al. 2007). The mitofusins, Mfn1 and Mfn2, are located on the mitochondrial outer membrane and are involved in early steps in membrane fusion (Koshiba et al. 2004; Meeusen et al. 2006; Song et al. 2009). The dynamin-related protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is associated with the inner membrane and is essential for inner membrane fusion (Meeusen et al. 2006; Song et al. 2009). In addition to its well-recognized function of controlling mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial fusion clearly protects mitochondrial function (Detmer & Chan, 2007). Mice lacking Mfn1/2 function in skeletal muscle exhibit both mitochondrial dysfunction and profound muscle atrophy (Chen et al. 2010). Mfn2 is a key target of the nuclear coactivator PGC-1α. Maintenance of a normal expression of Mfn2 is critical for the stimulatory effect of PGC-1α on mitochondrial membrane potential (Soriano et al. 2006) and PGC-1α may regulate mitochondrial fusion/fission events and hence mitochondrial function (Soriano et al. 2006). The latter phenomena could reduce ATP generating capacity, which in turn could shift signalling pathways toward catabolism through activation of 5’AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK, a cellular kinase, senses the energy level of the cell and causes atrogin-1 and muscle-specific ring finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) induction via a FoxO3-dependent mechanism (Tong et al. 2009) determining muscle loss. The goal of the present study was to clarify whether mytochondrial dysfunction, recently indicated to play a major role in soleus (Cannavino et al. 2014), could trigger disuse-induced muscle atrophy also in a fast muscle, the gastrocnemius, which has different metabolism, much lower mitochondrial content (Jackman & Willis, 1996; Berchtold et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2002), low PGC-1α expression (Lin et al. 2002) and different redox balance response to disuse (Brocca et al. 2010). We show that: (1) HU resulted in the early down-regulation of pro-fusion protein expression and mitochondrial dysfunction; (2) energy stress activated the protein degradation pathway through AMPK activation; and (3) gastrocnemius atrophy was totally prevented by muscle-specific over-expression of PGC-1α through stimulation of Mfn2 expression.",
    "methods": "Methods Ethical approval Experiments were approved by the Italian Health Department and complied with the Italian guidelines for the use of laboratory animals, which conform to the European Community Directive published in 1986 (86/609/ECC). Animal care and hindlimb unloading Six-month-old male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) and transgenic mice overexpressing PGC-1α (TgPGC-1α) in skeletal muscle, as previously described (Lin et al. 2002), were used. Mice were unloaded for 3, 7 and 14 days as previously described (Brocca et al. 2010). Briefly, animals were suspended individually in special cages by thin string tied at one end to the tail and at the other end to the top of the cage; the length of the string was adjusted to allow the animals moving freely on the forelimbs, while the body was inclined at 30–40 deg from the horizontal plane. All mice had water and food ad libitum. The ground C57BL/6 and TgPGC-1α mice were maintained free in single cages and killed after 3, 7 or 14 days. The animals of all experimental groups were killed at 10.00 h after 2 h without food by cervical dislocation to allow removal of gastrocnemius muscle. Muscles were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Experimental plan Not all analyses were performed on both WT and TgPGC-1α mice at all times (3, 7 and 14 days), but the timing of HU, the strain of the animals and the analyses performed were chosen according to a precise rationale. WT mice were given 3 and 7 days of HU to analyse the time course of adaptations of muscle mass, intracellular pathways controlling muscle mass, redox status, mitochondrial impairment and AMPK pathway. As the experiment on WT mice suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction could be involved in causing gastrocnemius atrophy, to test such a conclusion and study the mechanisms underlying the potential prevention of muscle mass loss, TgPGC-1α mice were subjected to HU for 3 days. The time was chosen based on the observations that intracellular signalling pathways controlling muscle mass were previously shown to go through clear adaptations at that time in soleus (Cannavino et al. 2014) and in gastrocnemius (experiments on WT mice of this study), and that gastrocnemius was atrophic following 3 days of HU (Fig.1). TgPGC-1α mice underwent 14 days of HU because we wanted to check that PGC-1 α protein levels were maintained during chronic disuse in transgenic mice and that the positive effect on muscle size found at 3 days of HU was maintained also after prolonged disuse.

B, representative haematoxylin and eosin stainings of the gastrocnemius muscle of control mice (C), and mice unloaded for 3 days (HU-3) and 7 days (HU-7). *Significantly different from C, P < 0.05. Scale bar: 100 μm. Data are presented as means ± SEM. Cross-sectional area (CSA) analysis CSA of individual muscle fibres was determined in the mid-belly region of gastrocnemius muscles as previously described (Brocca et al. 2010). Briefly, muscle serial transverse sections (10 μm thick) were stained with haematoxylin-eosin. Images of the stained sections were captured from a light microscope (Leica DMLS) and transferred to a personal computer using a video camera (Leica DFC 280). Fibre CSA was measured with Image J analysis software (, Bethesda, MD, USA) and expressed in micrometres squared. Analysis of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform content MHC isoform content was determined using an electrophoretic approach previously described in detail (Brocca et al. 2010). Briefly, about 6 μg of each muscle sample were dissolved in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm NaPPi, 1× inhibitors protease phosphatase (Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1 mm PMSF). The lysates were loaded onto 8% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gels. Electrophoresis was run for 2 h at 200 V and then for 24 h at 250 V; the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Densitometric analysis of MHC bands was performed to assess the relative proportion of the MHC isoforms (Pellegrino et al. 2003) Western blot analysis Frozen muscle samples were pulverized and immediately re-suspended in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF and 2 mm NaPPi supplemented with 1× protease, phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mm PMSF). The homogenate obtained was centrifuged at 18000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant stored at −80°C until ready to use. Equal amounts of muscle samples were loaded on gradient precast gels purchased from Bio-Rad (AnyKd; Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were electro-transferred to PVDF membranes at 35 mA overnight. The membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies (see below). Thereafter, the membranes were incubated in HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The protein bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence method. The content of each protein investigated was assessed by determining the brightness–area product of the protein band as previously described (Gondin et al. 2011). OxyBlot analysis Muscle samples previously stored at −80°C were pulverized and homogenized at 4°C in an antioxidant buffer containing protease inhibitors, 25 mm imidazole and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, adjusted with NaOH as previously described in detail (Brocca et al. 2010). The lysate was left for 20 min on ice and the homogenate obtained was centrifuged at 18000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined on the supernatant using the RC DCTM protein assay kit (BioRad). The supernatant was stored at −80°C until ready to use. Protein carbonylation level was detected using an OxyBlot kit (AbNova, Taipei City, Taiwan), which provides reagents for sensitive immunodetection of these carbonyl groups. The carbonyl groups in the protein side chains are derivatized to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP hydrazone) by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH); 6 μg of the DNP-derivatized protein samples were separated by PAGE (15% SDS polyacrylamide gels) and then blotted for 2 h at 100 V to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes obtained were stained with Ponceau Red and then scanned. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody, specific to the DNP moiety of the proteins, and subsequently with an HRP–antibody conjugate directed against the primary antibody (secondary antibody: goat anti-rabbit IgG). Blots were developed by using an enhanced chemiluminescence method. Positive bands emitting light were detected by short exposure to photographic films. Protein oxidation was quantified by defining the oxidative index (OI), i.e. the ratio between densitometric values of the OxyBlot bands and those stained with Ponceau Red. Gene expression analysis Total RNA, from skeletal samples, was extracted using the Promega SV Total RNA isolation kit; the concentration of RNA was evaluated by using a NanoDrop instrument (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 300 ng was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to obtain cDNA. The cDNA was analysed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR; AB 7500) with the SYBR Green or TaqMan PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the data were normalized to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase rRNA.

Hydrogen peroxide quantification Frozen muscle samples were pulverized in a steel mortar with liquid nitrogen to obtain a powder that was immediately re-suspended in the assay buffer provided with the kit (Abcam). After protein quantification, samples were removed of all proteins. A standard curve with known H2O2 concentration was generated following the supplied protocol. Samples and H2O2 standards were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in HRP and OxiRed Probe that reacted with H2O2 to produce red fluorescence (Ex/Em = 535/587 nm) and measured with a micro-plate reader (Tecan Infinite 200 Pro) (Cannavino et al. 2014). OXPHOS capacity Maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (‘OXPHOS capacity’) was determined in permeabilized muscle fibres by high-resolution respirometry (Oxygraph 2-K; Oroboros Instruments, Innsbrück, Austria) (Salvadego et al. 2013). Fibre bundles were separated using sharp forceps in ice-cold preservation solution (BIOPS; Oroboros Instruments). Muscle samples in solution plus 10% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA and 30% (v/v) DMSO were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until analysis within 1 month. For analysis, muscle samples were quickly thawed by immersion in the preservation solution at room temperature, washed and permeabilized in saponin (50 μg ml–1) for 30 min at 4°C. Fibres were subsequently washed in a mitochondrial respiration solution (MiR05; Oroboros Instruments) and weighed before adding to a 3 ml chamber in the high-resolution respirometer and incubated with MiR05 at 37°C. The O2 concentration in the chamber was kept above 270 μm throughout the experiment, to avoid O2 diffusion limitation. Intermittent reoxygenation steps were performed by adding a 200 mm H2O2 solution into the medium containing catalase. O2 consumption in the chamber was measured polarographycally following a sequential administration of substrates. Maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (state 3 respiration) was measured after the addition of ADP (5.0 mm) as phosphate acceptor with malate (4 mm), glutamate (10 mm) and succinate (10 mm) as substrates. The addition of cytochrome c (10 μm) had no additive effects (<10%) on respiration, thereby confirming the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial respiration values were then normalized per citrate synthase (CS) content, taken as an estimate of mitochondrial mass. Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance of the differences between means was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Student–Newman–Keuls test. A probability of less than 5% was considered significant (P < 0.05).",
    "results": "Results CSA was reduced in gastrocnemius in the early phases of HU CSA of skeletal muscle fibres was analysed in the mid-belly region of gastrocnemius in control and unloaded mice. The measurements were performed on cryosections stained with haematoxylin–eosin. Gastrocnemius muscle fibres went through 14 and 12% of atrophy, respectively, at 3 and 7 days of HU (Fig.1). As the portion of muscle analysed contained almost solely MHC isoform IIB (Control MHC-IIB 91 ± 1.5%, MHC-IIX 5.5 ± 1.1% MHC-IIA 3.5 ± 0.8%), all fibres analysed were considered type IIB. The antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted to the initial reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase To examine the effects of HU on redox imbalance, we studied the expression of SOD1 and catalase, the two major enzymes of ROS scavenging, H2O2 content and protein carbonylation. Gastrocnemius showed an early SOD1 and catalase up-regulation evident at 3 and 7 days of HU compared with control (Fig.2D). H2O2 concentration (Fig.2A) and protein carbonylation (Fig.2B) levels were not different from control at any of the experimental times analysed. Figure 2.

Data are presented as means ± SEM. Mitochondrial fusion was impaired in gastrocnemius muscle in the early phases of HU To define the adaptations of oxidative metabolism to muscle disuse we used RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. To examine the effects of HU on expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes, the mRNA transcript and protein level of PGC-1α, playing a central role in mitochondrial biogenesis, were studied. PGC-1α mRNA and protein expression was unchanged both at 3 and at 7 days of HU (Fig.3). Similarly, no changes in levels of protein in mitochondrial complexes (Fig.3D) (Complexes I–V) at either time analysed were found. Figure 3.

Data are presented as means ± SEM.As the mitochondrial fission machinery is able to cause muscle wasting in mice (Romanello et al. 2010), the expression of DRP1, one of its major components, was analysed. Levels of DRP1 protein did not change at either time analysed (Fig.3C). However, a mismatch between the increase in CS protein level and its activity was observed on day 3 of HU (Fig.3E,F). CS protein and activity levels dropped significantly on day 7 of HU. Moreover, OXPHOS capacity in permeabilized fibres was impaired both at 3 and at 7 days (Fig.3G), suggesting an alteration of mitochondrial function. OXPHOS capacity was assessed based on maximal ADP-stimulated state 3 mitochondrial respiration (normalized per CS content), taken as an estimate of mitochondrial mass. As mitochondrial fusion protects mitochondrial function (Detmer & Chan, 2007), we also analysed expression of the pro-fusion proteins Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1. Importantly, a significantly lower level of such proteins was detected in HU animals compared to controls (Fig.3H). The latter results indicate alteration to the mitochondrial network, which could potentially lead to energy stress. Because when mitochondria are fragmented FoxO3 is activated via AMPK in myofibres and induces the expression of atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 (Romanello & Sandri, 2010), we studied the ratio of the active (phosphorylated) and total form of AMPK and its downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) by Western blotting. At 3 days of HU, no significant changes were observed in AMPK activation whereas a significant increase of ACC activation was found (Fig.4). Figure 4.

Data are presented as means ± SEM.Collectively, the results indicate that the mitochondrial network was compromised in gastrocnemius muscle and that this sustained an impairment of function and activation of the AMPK catabolic system. PGC-1α levels are maintained in transgenic mice during HU To elucidate the role of Mfn2 expression in disuse atrophy, muscle-specific transgenic mice for the peroxisome PGC-1α were used as PGC-1α is known to enhance expression of pro-fusion proteins (Soriano et al. 2006; Zorzano, 2009). First, to ensure muscle specificity of expression, PGC-1α expression in the gastrocnemius of Tg-PGC-1α mice using the WT samples as reference was assessed. Then, to check that protein levels were maintained during chronic disuse, Tg-PGC-1α mice were unloaded for 14 days. As expected, both PGC-1α mRNA and protein levels were higher in Tg-PGC-1α gastrocnemius than in the WT (Fig.5). Furthermore, the PGC-1α overexpression was maintained during disuse, i.e. both mRNA and protein levels were significantly up-regulated in Tg-PGC-1α after 14 days of HU in comparison to control Tg-PGC-1α (Fig. 5).

Elevated muscle PGC-1α completely preserved muscle mass by preventing the activation of catabolic systems As gastrocnemius atrophy occurs early into disuse (3 days, Fig.1) and we have previously found that the catabolic systems are also active early (Cannavino et al. 2014), Tg-PGC-1α mice were unloaded for 3 days. The TgPGC-1α mice showed complete resistance to HU muscle atrophy (Fig.6). The CSA of gastrocnemius fibres of Tg-PGC-1α mice was not different from that of C-Tg-PGC-1α. To assess whether the protection against muscle atrophy might fade with time, Tg-PGC-1α mice were unloaded for 14 days following HU. No atrophy was observed following 14 days of HU (Fig.6). Figure 6.

Data are presented as means ± SEM.As expected on the basis of muscle atrophy, catabolic systems were significantly induced at 3 days of HU compared to control animals, whereas high levels of PGC-1α completely blunted the up regulation of MuRF-1, atrogin-1, beclin1 and p62 genes (Fig.7A).

Data are presented as means ± SEM.To check whether the slight increase of p62 in the unloaded gastrocnemius muscle of TgPGC-1α animals resulted in increased autophagy, the level of lipidated microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) were studied. The cytosolic form of LC3-I, when recruited on autophagosomes, covalently binds phospholipids, resulting in a higher molecular weight protein named LC3-II. Therefore, the protein level of LC3-II is often used as a marker of autophagy (Kabeya et al. 2004). No significant changes in LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in unloaded TgPGC-1α samples compared to controls were found (Fig.7B). Therefore, the increased PGC-1α levels completely prevented activation of the catabolic systems in gastrocnemius. Hind limb suspension did not significantly affect the anabolic pathway in gastrocnemius muscle of WT and TgPGC-1α mice (Fig.7C). In fact, no differences were found in pAKT, pS6R and p4EBP1 activation. Elevated muscle PGC-1α completely prevented pro-fusion protein down-regulation and ACC activation To assess whether PGC-1α over-expression actually elicited its effect through a modulation of mitochondrial dynamics, Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1 and ACC were studied. PGC-1α overexpression completely prevented the decrease of Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 (Fig.8A) and also the increase of ACC (Fig.8B) in HU muscles. PGC-1α therefore appeared to be sufficient to preserve mitochondrial fusion proteins, to block activation of the energy-stress pathway and muscle atrophy. Figure 8.

    "discussion": "Discussion Although several studies have attempted to elucidate the signalling pathways involved in triggering atrophy during disuse of limb muscles, the exact mechanisms responsible for disuse-induced muscular atrophy are currently debated and there is still no therapy to treat muscle atrophy. Our previous findings have indicated that a metabolic programme might be the major phenomenon triggering muscle atrophy in HU mice (Cannavino et al. 2014). We demonstrated, in fact, that a fall in the levels of PGC-1α can be responsible for the activation of proteolytic pathways through FoxO3 disinhibition, leading to the conclusion that deregulation in PGC-1α is the molecular switch that triggers protein breakdown. The latter work was performed on soleus muscle, a slow muscle with high oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial content and PGC-1α expression. As fast muscles rely mainly on glycolytic metabolisms, have much lower mitochondrial content (Jackman & Willis, 1996; Berchtold et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2002), and express PGC-1α at low levels (Lin et al. 2002), a metabolic programme might not be as relevant in gastrocnemius as in soleus. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that also in fast muscles disuse-induced muscle atrophy could be due to a metabolic programme. Gastrocnemius muscle went through atrophy following both 3 and 7 days of HU, confirming, and extending to earlier times, the results of previous studies, which showed significant gastrocnemius mass loss with long-term disuse (Kyparos et al. 2005; Brocca et al. 2010; Desaphy et al. 2010). Although the loss of CSA appeared to plateau between 3 and 7 days, note that, following 14 days of HU, CSA of type IIB fibres from gastrocnemius was 25% lower than in controls, indicating that disuse atrophy in gastrocnemius actually progresses beyond 7 days. However, the observation of a plateau is intriguing. It is consistent with some previous observations (Isfort et al. 2002) and at variance with others (Bodine, 2013). The rate of muscle mass loss might vary according to the time course of the adaptations of the intracellular signalling pathways controlling muscle mass, which in turn might vary from pathway to pathway. Oxidative stress and disuse atrophy in a fast muscle The present study supports the idea that even in fast muscle oxidative stress might not be the main phenomenon in triggering disuse muscle atrophy (Ikemoto et al. 2002; Koesterer et al. 2002; Servais et al. 2007; Brocca et al. 2010; Desaphy et al. 2010; Glover et al. 2010; Kuwahara et al. 2010; Pellegrino et al. 2011b; Powers et al. 2012; Cannavino et al. 2014). Redox imbalance occurred early into HU in gastrocnemius consistently with the up-regulation of SOD1 and catalase (Fig.2). The lack of H2O2 accumulation together with the absence of carbonylation both at 3 and at 7 days of HU (Fig.2) indicates that, in the early phase of disuse, the antioxidant defence system efficiently reacts to the initial ROS increase. This compensatory increase in antioxidant activity is maintained over time, in agreement with the absence of carbonylation found at 14 days of HU (Brocca et al. 2010). Given that we have previously shown that antioxidant treatment during unloading did not prevent gastrocnemius atrophy, the data suggest that oxidative stress might not be the major phenomenon of disuse atrophy in fast muscle (Brocca et al. 2010). Imbalance between mitochondrial fission and fusion and AMPK activation in fast muscles following HU In contrast to what was observed in soleus (Cannavino et al. 2014), unloaded gastrocnemius showed normal PGC-1α levels (Fig.2) and no alterations in mitochondrial complex expression, suggesting different mechanisms for fast muscle atrophy. Previous findings regarding PGC-1α during disuse in fast muscle are contradictory. In fact, higher (Wagatsuma et al. 2011), lower (Mazzatti et al. 2008) and unchanged (Nagatomo et al. 2011) PGC-1α levels have been reported. Furthermore, mitochondrial complexes did not drastically change with disuse in fast muscle, and only a reduction of complex I expression was found after 28 days of unloading in gastrocnemius muscle (Liu et al. 2012b). This notwithstanding, several lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial alterations could be good candidates in triggering atrophy even in fast muscle. In fact, alteration in mitochondrial biogenesis (Liu et al. 2012b) and mitochondrial respiration (Yajid et al. 1998) have been found after chronic disuse in fast skeletal muscle. Mitochondria play critical roles in the life and death of cells. Mitochondrial dynamics are regulated by coordinated fusion and fission cycles performed by a complex molecular machinery. Mitochondrial dynamics maintain normal mitochondrial function by degrading damaged mitochondria and generating new mitochondria. The mitochondrion is vital to cellular energy and metabolism, being the site of generation of most ATP. Derangements in fusion–fission have been proposed as a mechanism underlying the formation of dysfunctional aberrant mitochondria (Yoon et al. 2006) and causing muscle atrophy through activation of AMPK (Romanello et al. 2010). Fusion–fission derangement can be due to an excessive activation of fission. In contrast to observations in soleus (Cannavino et al. 2014), unchanged DRP1 mRNA levels (Fig.3) suggest that in the early phases of gastrocnemius atrophy there is no excessive fission activation. Mitochondrial fusion was assessed based on the expression of three large GTPases that require the coordinated fusion of the outer and inner membranes: Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1. A defective mitochondrial fusion, revealed by a down-regulation of Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1, occurred (Fig.3), in agreement with previous reports in fast muscle during early (Wagatsuma et al. 2011) and chronic disuse (Liu et al. 2012b). Mitochondrial fusion can protect mitochondrial function (Detmer & Chan, 2007). Consistently, we found an impairment of OXPHOS capacity assessed as the maximal ADP-stimulated state 3 mitochondrial respiration (Fig.3). Together with a mismatch between the increase in CS protein level and its activity, the latter suggests a compensatory mechanism to an intrinsic oxidative defect in fast twitch muscle. The decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis and impaired mitochondrial function could lower ATP production, generate energy imbalance and activate protein catabolism. The energy level of the cell is, in fact, sensed by AMPK, a cellular kinase, which can cause atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 induction via a FoxO3-dependent mechanism (Tong et al. 2009). Interestingly, an early up-regulation of ACC, a kinase downstream of AMPK, was observed (Fig.4), indicating activation of AMPK. The latter results suggest that mitochondrial alteration could be important in determining muscle size during disuse in fast muscles. Several signalling kinases, including AMPK, have been implicated in activating PGC-1α transcription in response to various stimuli (Irrcher et al. 2008). This might explain why, following HU, PGC-1α level is unchanged. PGC-1α over-expression prevents HU-induced muscle atrophy and imbalance in mitochondrial fusion and fission To test the role of mitochondrial alterations we used transgenic mice overexpressing PGC-1α. In fact, it has been shown that the Mfn2 gene is controlled by PGC-1α and PGC-1β in conjunction with oestrogen-related receptor-α (Soriano et al. 2006; Liesa et al. 2008) and PGC-1α stimulates Mfn2 expression (Soriano et al. 2006; Zorzano, 2009). We subjected transgenic mice overexpressing PGC-1α to 3 days of HU. The duration of HU was chosen based on the observation that in soleus maximal induction of catabolic genes occurred 3 days after unloading (Cannavino et al. 2014). Skeletal muscle overexpressing PGC-α displayed complete resistance to loss of mass following 3 days of HU and this positive effect on muscle size was fully maintained also after prolonged disuse (14 days) (Fig.6), consistent with the high and steady protein levels of PGC-1α (Fig.5). To test the mechanism underlying this effect on muscle size, we analysed the main pathways controlling muscle mass. The ubiquitine proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy are the two major proteolytic systems responsible for muscle wasting. Among several markers of UPS, two E3 ubiquitin ligases, MAFbx/Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 (also known as atrogenes), have been widely used as they are highly expressed in many conditions of muscle wasting (Bodine et al. 2001a; Cohen et al. 2009). MuRF1 and atrogin-1 mRNA expression at 3 days (Fig.7) was dramatically increased, indicating UPS activation in the early phases of disuse atrophy. Disuse also induced expression of genes involved in autophagy (Beclin1 and p62) (Fig.7). It has been recently understood that an increase in activity of the autophagy system can have a role in muscle atrophy (Sandri, 2010). The latter findings indicate that, at least in the early stages of disuse, gastrocnemius mass loss is supported by activation of both the UPS and autophagy systems, consistent with previous observations (Bodine et al. 2001a; Ikemoto et al. 2002; Haddad et al. 2006; Kline et al. 2007). Signalling through the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (PI3K/AKY/mTOR) pathway controls protein synthesis and muscle hypertrophy (Rommel et al. 2001). In gastrocnemius muscle, HU did not result in any significant alterations in the phosphorylation states of the anabolic pathway after 3 days (Fig.7). Little and contradictory information is available on the impact of disuse on activation of the protein synthesis signalling pathway in fast muscles. Although our results are not in agreement with those of Bodine et al. (2001b), who found a decrease in the protein synthesis signalling pathway in atrophied gastrocnemius muscle at 14 days of unloading, they are in line with the concept that protein synthesis regulation differs among muscle types (Hornberger et al. 2001). Indeed, several lines of evidence indicate an increase or no changes in protein synthesis in fast muscles in different disuse models, including HU. An increase in translation factors (p70S6K, eEF-2 and eIF-2a) has been reported in the atrophied fast EDL muscle at 7 days of denervation (Hornberger et al. 2001). Loss of gastrocnemius mass independent of a decrease in protein synthesis has been reported after unilateral hindlimb immobilization (Krawiec et al. 2005). Finally, in line with our results, Liu et al. (2012a) showed a biphasic protein translational signalling response of gastrocnemius to HU. Specifically, the authors found that the initial unloading phase was associated with increased repression of 4EBP1 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1) on translation initiation factor eIF4E without alteration of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K/S6 pathway, while prolonged disuse (14 days) was associated with activation of translational signalling, including activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K/S6 pathway and diminished repression of 4EBP1 on eIF4E. The findings discussed so far prompted the hypothesis that in fast muscles an early down-regulation of pro-fusion proteins at 3 days of HU, through concomitant AMPK activation, can activate the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and autophagy, and ultimately cause muscle mass loss in disuse. The latter hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that overexpression of PGC-α was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1) (Fig.8), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway (Fig.8), (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and the autophagic factors (Fig.7); and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse. Conclusions The present results and our recent previous study (Cannavino et al. 2014) strongly support the idea that a metabolic programme can play a major role in triggering disuse muscle atrophy both in slow and in fast muscles. However, the metabolic programme would exert its effects through different pathways in slow, soleus and fast, gastrocnemius muscles. In soleus the primary phenomenon would be a fall of PGC-1α expression and content, which would cause induction of atrogenes through FoxO3 disinhibition (Cannavino et al. 2014), whereas in gastrocnemius the primary phenomenon would be a down-regulation of pro-fusion proteins, which in turn would cause energy stress and induction of atrogenes through AMPK activation (Fig.9). It is known that during muscle wasting the enhanced FoxO activity results in increased transcription of Mul1, a mitochondrial E3 ligase, which ubiquitinates and targets Mfn2 for degradation through the UPS, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction (Lokireddy et al. 2012). Interestingly, slow-twitch muscle has small amounts of Mul1 but high Mfn2 protein levels whereas fast-twitch muscles express higher levels of Mul1 and low levels of Mfn2 (Lokireddy et al. 2012). The latter phenomenon probably exposes fast muscles to a rapid degradation of Mfn2 with subsequent alteration of mitochondrial fusion, which precedes the fall of PGC-α levels that occurs in the late stages of disuse. Figure 9. Scheme representing the effects of the early stages of disuse on gastrocnemius muscle. Open in a new tab Skeletal muscle disuse would cause down-regulation of pro-fusion proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and AMPK activation. AMPK activation leads to the activation of FoxO, which induces the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in protein degradation via both the autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome pathways. The increase in the rate of protein degradation causes gastrocnemius atrophy. AMPK might also prevent the down-regulation of PGC-1α in gastrocnemius in the early stages of HU. Changes of protein synthesis would not be responsible for gastrocnemius atrophy at this stage of disuse.Moreover, our results show that PGC-1α levels higher than basal are necessary to increase pro-fusion proteins, thus preventing gastrocnemius muscle atrophy during disuse. Interestingly, the higher efficacy of resistance training in preventing muscle mass loss compared to endurance training could be due to the fact that although both types of exercise increase PGC-1α expression, at a given exercise volume the higher the intensity the higher the effect (Egan et al. 2010). As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity were sustained throughout disuse (Fig.6), compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy.",

The Journal of Physiology © 2015 The Physiological Society  Copyright notice ID: 4405755 PMID: 25565653 Abstract The mechanisms triggering disuse muscle atrophy remain of debate. It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling muscle mass. We have recently shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in disuse atrophy of soleus, a slow, oxidative muscle. Here we tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction in fast muscles too, notwithstanding their much lower mitochondrial content. Gastrocnemius displayed atrophy following both 3 and 7 days of unloading. SOD1 and catalase up-regulation, no H2O2 accumulation and no increase of protein carbonylation suggest the antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted to redox imbalance in the early phases of disuse. A defective mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 down-regulation) occurred together with an impairment of OXPHOS capacity. Furthermore, at 3 days of unloading higher acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation was found, suggesting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. To test the role of mitochondrial alterations we used Tg-mice overexpressing PGC-1α because of the known effect of PGC-1α on stimulation of Mfn2 expression. PGC-α overexpression was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway, (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and of authopagic factors, and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse. As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity were sustained throughout disuse, compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy also in fast muscles.Key points Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs as a result of disuse. Although several studies have established that a decrease in protein synthesis and increase in protein degradation lead to muscle atrophy, little is known about the triggers underlying such processes. A growing body of evidence challenges oxidative stress as a trigger of disuse atrophy; furthermore, it is also becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a causative role in determining muscle atrophy. Mitochondrial fusion and fission have emerged as important processes that govern mitochondrial function and PGC-1α may regulate fusion/fission events. Although most studies on mice have focused on the anti-gravitary slow soleus muscle as it is preferentially affected by disuse atrophy, several fast muscles (including gastrocnemius) go through a significant loss of mass following unloading. Here we found that in fast muscles an early down-regulation of pro-fusion proteins, through concomitant AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, can activate catabolic systems, and ultimately cause muscle mass loss in disuse. Elevated muscle PGC-1α completely preserves muscle mass by preventing the fall in pro-fusion protein expression, AMPK and catabolic system activation, suggesting that compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy. Introduction The molecular mechanisms that govern the imbalance between pathways controlling protein synthesis and degradation in disuse muscle atrophy remain unclear, notwithstanding the large amount of work done (Bonaldo & Sandri, 2013). Investigations of multiple models of disuse in animals have shown an up-regulation of genes related to protein degradation and stress response as well as a down-regulation of those related to transcription and translation, and energy metabolism (Lecker et al. 2004; Bodine, 2013). Debate is ongoing regarding whether and to what extent redox signalling can actually be the trigger of such phenomena (Pellegrino et al. 2011a,b; Powers et al. 2012). A growing body of evidence challenges oxidative stress as a trigger of disuse atrophy (Ikemoto et al. 2002; Koesterer et al. 2002; Servais et al. 2007; Brocca et al. 2010; Desaphy et al. 2010; Glover et al. 2010; Kuwahara et al. 2010; Pellegrino et al. 2011b; Powers et al. 2012; Cannavino et al. 2014). We have recently reported that, in soleus muscle, notwithstanding an early persistent redox imbalance, a metabolic programme controlling muscle mass, rather than oxidative stress, played a major role in triggering hindlimb unloading (HU) muscle atrophy. A down-regulation of peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) expression and protein content was, in fact, shown to activate catabolic systems by promoting ubiquitin ligase and autophagy gene expression through FoxO3 disinhibition (Cannavino et al. 2014). Although most studies on mice have focused on the anti-gravitary, slow soleus muscle as it is preferentially affected by disuse atrophy, several fast muscles (including gastrocnemius) go through a significant loss of mass following unloading (Kyparos et al. 2005; Brocca et al. 2010; Desaphy et al. 2010). As fast muscles in mice have mostly a glycolytic metabolism and express low levels of PGC-1 (Lin et al. 2002), the metabolic programme supporting disuse-induced muscle mass loss in soleus might not be relevant in fast muscles. Data regarding PGC-1α during disuse in fast muscles are inconsistent: increases (Wagatsuma et al. 2011), decreases (Mazzatti et al. 2008) as well as no change (Nagatomo et al. 2011) of PGC-1α levels have been reported. However, alterations of mitochondrial biogenesis (Liu et al. 2012b), mitochondrial respiration (Yajid et al. 1998) and mitochondrial dynamics (Wagatsuma et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2012b) have been shown after prolonged unloading in fast muscles. Moreover, in our previous study we demonstrated that antioxidant treatment during unloading did not prevent gastrocnemius atrophy, suggesting that oxidative stress is not the major cause of disuse atrophy also in fast muscle (Brocca et al. 2010). A recent report has highlighted the importance of mitochondrial dynamics in cell and animal physiology. Mitochondria constantly fuse and divide, and an imbalance of these two processes dramatically alters overall mitochondrial morphology and function (Chen & Chan, 2005). Mitochondrial fusion and fission have emerged as important processes that govern mitochondrial function (Detmer & Chan, 2007; Hoppins et al. 2007). The mitofusins, Mfn1 and Mfn2, are located on the mitochondrial outer membrane and are involved in early steps in membrane fusion (Koshiba et al. 2004; Meeusen et al. 2006; Song et al. 2009). The dynamin-related protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is associated with the inner membrane and is essential for inner membrane fusion (Meeusen et al. 2006; Song et al. 2009). In addition to its well-recognized function of controlling mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial fusion clearly protects mitochondrial function (Detmer & Chan, 2007). Mice lacking Mfn1/2 function in skeletal muscle exhibit both mitochondrial dysfunction and profound muscle atrophy (Chen et al. 2010). Mfn2 is a key target of the nuclear coactivator PGC-1α. Maintenance of a normal expression of Mfn2 is critical for the stimulatory effect of PGC-1α on mitochondrial membrane potential (Soriano et al. 2006) and PGC-1α may regulate mitochondrial fusion/fission events and hence mitochondrial function (Soriano et al. 2006). The latter phenomena could reduce ATP generating capacity, which in turn could shift signalling pathways toward catabolism through activation of 5’AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK, a cellular kinase, senses the energy level of the cell and causes atrogin-1 and muscle-specific ring finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) induction via a FoxO3-dependent mechanism (Tong et al. 2009) determining muscle loss. The goal of the present study was to clarify whether mytochondrial dysfunction, recently indicated to play a major role in soleus (Cannavino et al. 2014), could trigger disuse-induced muscle atrophy also in a fast muscle, the gastrocnemius, which has different metabolism, much lower mitochondrial content (Jackman & Willis, 1996; Berchtold et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2002), low PGC-1α expression (Lin et al. 2002) and different redox balance response to disuse (Brocca et al. 2010). We show that: (1) HU resulted in the early down-regulation of pro-fusion protein expression and mitochondrial dysfunction; (2) energy stress activated the protein degradation pathway through AMPK activation; and (3) gastrocnemius atrophy was totally prevented by muscle-specific over-expression of PGC-1α through stimulation of Mfn2 expression.Methods Ethical approval Experiments were approved by the Italian Health Department and complied with the Italian guidelines for the use of laboratory animals, which conform to the European Community Directive published in 1986 (86/609/ECC).Animal care and hindlimb unloading Six-month-old male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) and transgenic mice overexpressing PGC-1α (TgPGC-1α) in skeletal muscle, as previously described (Lin et al. 2002), were used. Mice were unloaded for 3, 7 and 14 days as previously described (Brocca et al. 2010). Briefly, animals were suspended individually in special cages by thin string tied at one end to the tail and at the other end to the top of the cage; the length of the string was adjusted to allow the animals moving freely on the forelimbs, while the body was inclined at 30–40 deg from the horizontal plane. All mice had water and food ad libitum. The ground C57BL/6 and TgPGC-1α mice were maintained free in single cages and killed after 3, 7 or 14 days. The animals of all experimental groups were killed at 10.00 h after 2 h without food by cervical dislocation to allow removal of gastrocnemius muscle. Muscles were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.Experimental plan Not all analyses were performed on both WT and TgPGC-1α mice at all times (3, 7 and 14 days), but the timing of HU, the strain of the animals and the analyses performed were chosen according to a precise rationale. WT mice were given 3 and 7 days of HU to analyse the time course of adaptations of muscle mass, intracellular pathways controlling muscle mass, redox status, mitochondrial impairment and AMPK pathway. As the experiment on WT mice suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction could be involved in causing gastrocnemius atrophy, to test such a conclusion and study the mechanisms underlying the potential prevention of muscle mass loss, TgPGC-1α mice were subjected to HU for 3 days. The time was chosen based on the observations that intracellular signalling pathways controlling muscle mass were previously shown to go through clear adaptations at that time in soleus (Cannavino et al. 2014) and in gastrocnemius (experiments on WT mice of this study), and that gastrocnemius was atrophic following 3 days of HU (Fig.1). TgPGC-1α mice underwent 14 days of HU because we wanted to check that PGC-1 α protein levels were maintained during chronic disuse in transgenic mice and that the positive effect on muscle size found at 3 days of HU was maintained also after prolonged disuse.

Scale bar: 100 μm. Data are presented as means ± SEM.Cross-sectional area (CSA) analysis CSA of individual muscle fibres was determined in the mid-belly region of gastrocnemius muscles as previously described (Brocca et al. 2010). Briefly, muscle serial transverse sections (10 μm thick) were stained with haematoxylin-eosin. Images of the stained sections were captured from a light microscope (Leica DMLS) and transferred to a personal computer using a video camera (Leica DFC 280). Fibre CSA was measured with Image J analysis software (, Bethesda, MD, USA) and expressed in micrometres squared.Analysis of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform content MHC isoform content was determined using an electrophoretic approach previously described in detail (Brocca et al. 2010). Briefly, about 6 μg of each muscle sample were dissolved in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm NaPPi, 1× inhibitors protease phosphatase (Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1 mm PMSF). The lysates were loaded onto 8% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gels. Electrophoresis was run for 2 h at 200 V and then for 24 h at 250 V; the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Densitometric analysis of MHC bands was performed to assess the relative proportion of the MHC isoforms (Pellegrino et al. 2003)Western blot analysis Frozen muscle samples were pulverized and immediately re-suspended in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF and 2 mm NaPPi supplemented with 1× protease, phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mm PMSF). The homogenate obtained was centrifuged at 18000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant stored at −80°C until ready to use. Equal amounts of muscle samples were loaded on gradient precast gels purchased from Bio-Rad (AnyKd; Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were electro-transferred to PVDF membranes at 35 mA overnight. The membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies (see below). Thereafter, the membranes were incubated in HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The protein bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence method. The content of each protein investigated was assessed by determining the brightness–area product of the protein band as previously described (Gondin et al. 2011).OxyBlot analysis Muscle samples previously stored at −80°C were pulverized and homogenized at 4°C in an antioxidant buffer containing protease inhibitors, 25 mm imidazole and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, adjusted with NaOH as previously described in detail (Brocca et al. 2010). The lysate was left for 20 min on ice and the homogenate obtained was centrifuged at 18000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined on the supernatant using the RC DCTM protein assay kit (BioRad). The supernatant was stored at −80°C until ready to use. Protein carbonylation level was detected using an OxyBlot kit (AbNova, Taipei City, Taiwan), which provides reagents for sensitive immunodetection of these carbonyl groups. The carbonyl groups in the protein side chains are derivatized to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP hydrazone) by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH); 6 μg of the DNP-derivatized protein samples were separated by PAGE (15% SDS polyacrylamide gels) and then blotted for 2 h at 100 V to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes obtained were stained with Ponceau Red and then scanned. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody, specific to the DNP moiety of the proteins, and subsequently with an HRP–antibody conjugate directed against the primary antibody (secondary antibody: goat anti-rabbit IgG). Blots were developed by using an enhanced chemiluminescence method. Positive bands emitting light were detected by short exposure to photographic films. Protein oxidation was quantified by defining the oxidative index (OI), i.e. the ratio between densitometric values of the OxyBlot bands and those stained with Ponceau Red.Gene expression analysis Total RNA, from skeletal samples, was extracted using the Promega SV Total RNA isolation kit; the concentration of RNA was evaluated by using a NanoDrop instrument (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 300 ng was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to obtain cDNA. The cDNA was analysed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR; AB 7500) with the SYBR Green or TaqMan PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the data were normalized to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase rRNA.

After protein quantification, samples were removed of all proteins. A standard curve with known H2O2 concentration was generated following the supplied protocol. Samples and H2O2 standards were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in HRP and OxiRed Probe that reacted with H2O2 to produce red fluorescence (Ex/Em = 535/587 nm) and measured with a micro-plate reader (Tecan Infinite 200 Pro) (Cannavino et al. 2014).OXPHOS capacity Maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (‘OXPHOS capacity’) was determined in permeabilized muscle fibres by high-resolution respirometry (Oxygraph 2-K; Oroboros Instruments, Innsbrück, Austria) (Salvadego et al. 2013). Fibre bundles were separated using sharp forceps in ice-cold preservation solution (BIOPS; Oroboros Instruments). Muscle samples in solution plus 10% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA and 30% (v/v) DMSO were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until analysis within 1 month. For analysis, muscle samples were quickly thawed by immersion in the preservation solution at room temperature, washed and permeabilized in saponin (50 μg ml–1) for 30 min at 4°C. Fibres were subsequently washed in a mitochondrial respiration solution (MiR05; Oroboros Instruments) and weighed before adding to a 3 ml chamber in the high-resolution respirometer and incubated with MiR05 at 37°C. The O2 concentration in the chamber was kept above 270 μm throughout the experiment, to avoid O2 diffusion limitation. Intermittent reoxygenation steps were performed by adding a 200 mm H2O2 solution into the medium containing catalase. O2 consumption in the chamber was measured polarographycally following a sequential administration of substrates. Maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (state 3 respiration) was measured after the addition of ADP (5.0 mm) as phosphate acceptor with malate (4 mm), glutamate (10 mm) and succinate (10 mm) as substrates. The addition of cytochrome c (10 μm) had no additive effects (<10%) on respiration, thereby confirming the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial respiration values were then normalized per citrate synthase (CS) content, taken as an estimate of mitochondrial mass.Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance of the differences between means was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Student–Newman–Keuls test. A probability of less than 5% was considered significant (P < 0.05).Results CSA was reduced in gastrocnemius in the early phases of HU CSA of skeletal muscle fibres was analysed in the mid-belly region of gastrocnemius in control and unloaded mice. The measurements were performed on cryosections stained with haematoxylin–eosin. Gastrocnemius muscle fibres went through 14 and 12% of atrophy, respectively, at 3 and 7 days of HU (Fig.1). As the portion of muscle analysed contained almost solely MHC isoform IIB (Control MHC-IIB 91 ± 1.5%, MHC-IIX 5.5 ± 1.1% MHC-IIA 3.5 ± 0.8%), all fibres analysed were considered type IIB.The antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted to the initial reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase To examine the effects of HU on redox imbalance, we studied the expression of SOD1 and catalase, the two major enzymes of ROS scavenging, H2O2 content and protein carbonylation. Gastrocnemius showed an early SOD1 and catalase up-regulation evident at 3 and 7 days of HU compared with control (Fig.2D). H2O2 concentration (Fig.2A) and protein carbonylation (Fig.2B) levels were not different from control at any of the experimental times analysed. Figure 2.

Data are presented as means ± SEM.Mitochondrial fusion was impaired in gastrocnemius muscle in the early phases of HU To define the adaptations of oxidative metabolism to muscle disuse we used RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. To examine the effects of HU on expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes, the mRNA transcript and protein level of PGC-1α, playing a central role in mitochondrial biogenesis, were studied. PGC-1α mRNA and protein expression was unchanged both at 3 and at 7 days of HU (Fig.3). Similarly, no changes in levels of protein in mitochondrial complexes (Fig.3D) (Complexes I–V) at either time analysed were found. Figure 3.

Data are presented as means ± SEM.As the mitochondrial fission machinery is able to cause muscle wasting in mice (Romanello et al. 2010), the expression of DRP1, one of its major components, was analysed. Levels of DRP1 protein did not change at either time analysed (Fig.3C). However, a mismatch between the increase in CS protein level and its activity was observed on day 3 of HU (Fig.3E,F). CS protein and activity levels dropped significantly on day 7 of HU. Moreover, OXPHOS capacity in permeabilized fibres was impaired both at 3 and at 7 days (Fig.3G), suggesting an alteration of mitochondrial function. OXPHOS capacity was assessed based on maximal ADP-stimulated state 3 mitochondrial respiration (normalized per CS content), taken as an estimate of mitochondrial mass. As mitochondrial fusion protects mitochondrial function (Detmer & Chan, 2007), we also analysed expression of the pro-fusion proteins Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1. Importantly, a significantly lower level of such proteins was detected in HU animals compared to controls (Fig.3H). The latter results indicate alteration to the mitochondrial network, which could potentially lead to energy stress. Because when mitochondria are fragmented FoxO3 is activated via AMPK in myofibres and induces the expression of atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 (Romanello & Sandri, 2010), we studied the ratio of the active (phosphorylated) and total form of AMPK and its downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) by Western blotting. At 3 days of HU, no significant changes were observed in AMPK activation whereas a significant increase of ACC activation was found (Fig.4). Figure 4.

Data are presented as means ± SEM.Collectively, the results indicate that the mitochondrial network was compromised in gastrocnemius muscle and that this sustained an impairment of function and activation of the AMPK catabolic system.PGC-1α levels are maintained in transgenic mice during HU To elucidate the role of Mfn2 expression in disuse atrophy, muscle-specific transgenic mice for the peroxisome PGC-1α were used as PGC-1α is known to enhance expression of pro-fusion proteins (Soriano et al. 2006; Zorzano, 2009). First, to ensure muscle specificity of expression, PGC-1α expression in the gastrocnemius of Tg-PGC-1α mice using the WT samples as reference was assessed. Then, to check that protein levels were maintained during chronic disuse, Tg-PGC-1α mice were unloaded for 14 days. As expected, both PGC-1α mRNA and protein levels were higher in Tg-PGC-1α gastrocnemius than in the WT (Fig.5). Furthermore, the PGC-1α overexpression was maintained during disuse, i.e. both mRNA and protein levels were significantly up-regulated in Tg-PGC-1α after 14 days of HU in comparison to control Tg-PGC-1α (Fig. 5). Figure 5. In transgenic mice, PGC-1α levels are maintained during HU. Open in a new tab A, quantification of mRNA levels of PGC-1α in WT and transgenic mice.

Data are presented as means ± SEM.Elevated muscle PGC-1α completely preserved muscle mass by preventing the activation of catabolic systems As gastrocnemius atrophy occurs early into disuse (3 days, Fig.1) and we have previously found that the catabolic systems are also active early (Cannavino et al. 2014), Tg-PGC-1α mice were unloaded for 3 days. The TgPGC-1α mice showed complete resistance to HU muscle atrophy (Fig.6). The CSA of gastrocnemius fibres of Tg-PGC-1α mice was not different from that of C-Tg-PGC-1α. To assess whether the protection against muscle atrophy might fade with time, Tg-PGC-1α mice were unloaded for 14 days following HU. No atrophy was observed following 14 days of HU (Fig.6). Figure 6.

Data are presented as means ± SEM.As expected on the basis of muscle atrophy, catabolic systems were significantly induced at 3 days of HU compared to control animals, whereas high levels of PGC-1α completely blunted the up regulation of MuRF-1, atrogin-1, beclin1 and p62 genes (Fig.7A). Figure 7. Increased PGC-1α expression in muscle prevents activation of the catabolic systems.

D, representative Western blot of synthetic factors. *Significantly different from C, P < 0.05; #significantly different from C-TgPGC-1α, P < 0.05. Data are presented as means ± SEM.To check whether the slight increase of p62 in the unloaded gastrocnemius muscle of TgPGC-1α animals resulted in increased autophagy, the level of lipidated microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) were studied. The cytosolic form of LC3-I, when recruited on autophagosomes, covalently binds phospholipids, resulting in a higher molecular weight protein named LC3-II. Therefore, the protein level of LC3-II is often used as a marker of autophagy (Kabeya et al. 2004). No significant changes in LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in unloaded TgPGC-1α samples compared to controls were found (Fig.7B). Therefore, the increased PGC-1α levels completely prevented activation of the catabolic systems in gastrocnemius. Hind limb suspension did not significantly affect the anabolic pathway in gastrocnemius muscle of WT and TgPGC-1α mice (Fig.7C). In fact, no differences were found in pAKT, pS6R and p4EBP1 activation.Elevated muscle PGC-1α completely prevented pro-fusion protein down-regulation and ACC activation To assess whether PGC-1α over-expression actually elicited its effect through a modulation of mitochondrial dynamics, Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1 and ACC were studied. PGC-1α overexpression completely prevented the decrease of Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 (Fig.8A) and also the increase of ACC (Fig.8B) in HU muscles. PGC-1α therefore appeared to be sufficient to preserve mitochondrial fusion proteins, to block activation of the energy-stress pathway and muscle atrophy. Figure 8.

Data are presented as means ± SEM.Discussion Although several studies have attempted to elucidate the signalling pathways involved in triggering atrophy during disuse of limb muscles, the exact mechanisms responsible for disuse-induced muscular atrophy are currently debated and there is still no therapy to treat muscle atrophy. Our previous findings have indicated that a metabolic programme might be the major phenomenon triggering muscle atrophy in HU mice (Cannavino et al. 2014). We demonstrated, in fact, that a fall in the levels of PGC-1α can be responsible for the activation of proteolytic pathways through FoxO3 disinhibition, leading to the conclusion that deregulation in PGC-1α is the molecular switch that triggers protein breakdown. The latter work was performed on soleus muscle, a slow muscle with high oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial content and PGC-1α expression. As fast muscles rely mainly on glycolytic metabolisms, have much lower mitochondrial content (Jackman & Willis, 1996; Berchtold et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2002), and express PGC-1α at low levels (Lin et al. 2002), a metabolic programme might not be as relevant in gastrocnemius as in soleus. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that also in fast muscles disuse-induced muscle atrophy could be due to a metabolic programme. Gastrocnemius muscle went through atrophy following both 3 and 7 days of HU, confirming, and extending to earlier times, the results of previous studies, which showed significant gastrocnemius mass loss with long-term disuse (Kyparos et al. 2005; Brocca et al. 2010; Desaphy et al. 2010). Although the loss of CSA appeared to plateau between 3 and 7 days, note that, following 14 days of HU, CSA of type IIB fibres from gastrocnemius was 25% lower than in controls, indicating that disuse atrophy in gastrocnemius actually progresses beyond 7 days. However, the observation of a plateau is intriguing. It is consistent with some previous observations (Isfort et al. 2002) and at variance with others (Bodine, 2013). The rate of muscle mass loss might vary according to the time course of the adaptations of the intracellular signalling pathways controlling muscle mass, which in turn might vary from pathway to pathway. Oxidative stress and disuse atrophy in a fast muscle The present study supports the idea that even in fast muscle oxidative stress might not be the main phenomenon in triggering disuse muscle atrophy (Ikemoto et al. 2002; Koesterer et al. 2002; Servais et al. 2007; Brocca et al. 2010; Desaphy et al. 2010; Glover et al. 2010; Kuwahara et al. 2010; Pellegrino et al. 2011b; Powers et al. 2012; Cannavino et al. 2014). Redox imbalance occurred early into HU in gastrocnemius consistently with the up-regulation of SOD1 and catalase (Fig.2). The lack of H2O2 accumulation together with the absence of carbonylation both at 3 and at 7 days of HU (Fig.2) indicates that, in the early phase of disuse, the antioxidant defence system efficiently reacts to the initial ROS increase. This compensatory increase in antioxidant activity is maintained over time, in agreement with the absence of carbonylation found at 14 days of HU (Brocca et al. 2010). Given that we have previously shown that antioxidant treatment during unloading did not prevent gastrocnemius atrophy, the data suggest that oxidative stress might not be the major phenomenon of disuse atrophy in fast muscle (Brocca et al. 2010).Imbalance between mitochondrial fission and fusion and AMPK activation in fast muscles following HU In contrast to what was observed in soleus (Cannavino et al. 2014), unloaded gastrocnemius showed normal PGC-1α levels (Fig.2) and no alterations in mitochondrial complex expression, suggesting different mechanisms for fast muscle atrophy. Previous findings regarding PGC-1α during disuse in fast muscle are contradictory. In fact, higher (Wagatsuma et al. 2011), lower (Mazzatti et al. 2008) and unchanged (Nagatomo et al. 2011) PGC-1α levels have been reported. Furthermore, mitochondrial complexes did not drastically change with disuse in fast muscle, and only a reduction of complex I expression was found after 28 days of unloading in gastrocnemius muscle (Liu et al. 2012b). This notwithstanding, several lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial alterations could be good candidates in triggering atrophy even in fast muscle. In fact, alteration in mitochondrial biogenesis (Liu et al. 2012b) and mitochondrial respiration (Yajid et al. 1998) have been found after chronic disuse in fast skeletal muscle. Mitochondria play critical roles in the life and death of cells. Mitochondrial dynamics are regulated by coordinated fusion and fission cycles performed by a complex molecular machinery. Mitochondrial dynamics maintain normal mitochondrial function by degrading damaged mitochondria and generating new mitochondria. The mitochondrion is vital to cellular energy and metabolism, being the site of generation of most ATP. Derangements in fusion–fission have been proposed as a mechanism underlying the formation of dysfunctional aberrant mitochondria (Yoon et al. 2006) and causing muscle atrophy through activation of AMPK (Romanello et al. 2010). Fusion–fission derangement can be due to an excessive activation of fission. In contrast to observations in soleus (Cannavino et al. 2014), unchanged DRP1 mRNA levels (Fig.3) suggest that in the early phases of gastrocnemius atrophy there is no excessive fission activation. Mitochondrial fusion was assessed based on the expression of three large GTPases that require the coordinated fusion of the outer and inner membranes: Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1. A defective mitochondrial fusion, revealed by a down-regulation of Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1, occurred (Fig.3), in agreement with previous reports in fast muscle during early (Wagatsuma et al. 2011) and chronic disuse (Liu et al. 2012b). Mitochondrial fusion can protect mitochondrial function (Detmer & Chan, 2007). Consistently, we found an impairment of OXPHOS capacity assessed as the maximal ADP-stimulated state 3 mitochondrial respiration (Fig.3). Together with a mismatch between the increase in CS protein level and its activity, the latter suggests a compensatory mechanism to an intrinsic oxidative defect in fast twitch muscle. The decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis and impaired mitochondrial function could lower ATP production, generate energy imbalance and activate protein catabolism. The energy level of the cell is, in fact, sensed by AMPK, a cellular kinase, which can cause atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 induction via a FoxO3-dependent mechanism (Tong et al. 2009). Interestingly, an early up-regulation of ACC, a kinase downstream of AMPK, was observed (Fig.4), indicating activation of AMPK. The latter results suggest that mitochondrial alteration could be important in determining muscle size during disuse in fast muscles. Several signalling kinases, including AMPK, have been implicated in activating PGC-1α transcription in response to various stimuli (Irrcher et al. 2008). This might explain why, following HU, PGC-1α level is unchanged.PGC-1α over-expression prevents HU-induced muscle atrophy and imbalance in mitochondrial fusion and fission To test the role of mitochondrial alterations we used transgenic mice overexpressing PGC-1α. In fact, it has been shown that the Mfn2 gene is controlled by PGC-1α and PGC-1β in conjunction with oestrogen-related receptor-α (Soriano et al. 2006; Liesa et al. 2008) and PGC-1α stimulates Mfn2 expression (Soriano et al. 2006; Zorzano, 2009). We subjected transgenic mice overexpressing PGC-1α to 3 days of HU. The duration of HU was chosen based on the observation that in soleus maximal induction of catabolic genes occurred 3 days after unloading (Cannavino et al. 2014). Skeletal muscle overexpressing PGC-α displayed complete resistance to loss of mass following 3 days of HU and this positive effect on muscle size was fully maintained also after prolonged disuse (14 days) (Fig.6), consistent with the high and steady protein levels of PGC-1α (Fig.5). To test the mechanism underlying this effect on muscle size, we analysed the main pathways controlling muscle mass. The ubiquitine proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy are the two major proteolytic systems responsible for muscle wasting. Among several markers of UPS, two E3 ubiquitin ligases, MAFbx/Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 (also known as atrogenes), have been widely used as they are highly expressed in many conditions of muscle wasting (Bodine et al. 2001a; Cohen et al. 2009). MuRF1 and atrogin-1 mRNA expression at 3 days (Fig.7) was dramatically increased, indicating UPS activation in the early phases of disuse atrophy. Disuse also induced expression of genes involved in autophagy (Beclin1 and p62) (Fig.7). It has been recently understood that an increase in activity of the autophagy system can have a role in muscle atrophy (Sandri, 2010). The latter findings indicate that, at least in the early stages of disuse, gastrocnemius mass loss is supported by activation of both the UPS and autophagy systems, consistent with previous observations (Bodine et al. 2001a; Ikemoto et al. 2002; Haddad et al. 2006; Kline et al. 2007). Signalling through the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (PI3K/AKY/mTOR) pathway controls protein synthesis and muscle hypertrophy (Rommel et al. 2001). In gastrocnemius muscle, HU did not result in any significant alterations in the phosphorylation states of the anabolic pathway after 3 days (Fig.7). Little and contradictory information is available on the impact of disuse on activation of the protein synthesis signalling pathway in fast muscles. Although our results are not in agreement with those of Bodine et al. (2001b), who found a decrease in the protein synthesis signalling pathway in atrophied gastrocnemius muscle at 14 days of unloading, they are in line with the concept that protein synthesis regulation differs among muscle types (Hornberger et al. 2001). Indeed, several lines of evidence indicate an increase or no changes in protein synthesis in fast muscles in different disuse models, including HU. An increase in translation factors (p70S6K, eEF-2 and eIF-2a) has been reported in the atrophied fast EDL muscle at 7 days of denervation (Hornberger et al. 2001). Loss of gastrocnemius mass independent of a decrease in protein synthesis has been reported after unilateral hindlimb immobilization (Krawiec et al. 2005). Finally, in line with our results, Liu et al. (2012a) showed a biphasic protein translational signalling response of gastrocnemius to HU. Specifically, the authors found that the initial unloading phase was associated with increased repression of 4EBP1 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1) on translation initiation factor eIF4E without alteration of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K/S6 pathway, while prolonged disuse (14 days) was associated with activation of translational signalling, including activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K/S6 pathway and diminished repression of 4EBP1 on eIF4E. The findings discussed so far prompted the hypothesis that in fast muscles an early down-regulation of pro-fusion proteins at 3 days of HU, through concomitant AMPK activation, can activate the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and autophagy, and ultimately cause muscle mass loss in disuse. The latter hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that overexpression of PGC-α was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1) (Fig.8), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway (Fig.8), (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and the autophagic factors (Fig.7); and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse.Conclusions The present results and our recent previous study (Cannavino et al. 2014) strongly support the idea that a metabolic programme can play a major role in triggering disuse muscle atrophy both in slow and in fast muscles. However, the metabolic programme would exert its effects through different pathways in slow, soleus and fast, gastrocnemius muscles. In soleus the primary phenomenon would be a fall of PGC-1α expression and content, which would cause induction of atrogenes through FoxO3 disinhibition (Cannavino et al. 2014), whereas in gastrocnemius the primary phenomenon would be a down-regulation of pro-fusion proteins, which in turn would cause energy stress and induction of atrogenes through AMPK activation (Fig.9). It is known that during muscle wasting the enhanced FoxO activity results in increased transcription of Mul1, a mitochondrial E3 ligase, which ubiquitinates and targets Mfn2 for degradation through the UPS, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction (Lokireddy et al. 2012). Interestingly, slow-twitch muscle has small amounts of Mul1 but high Mfn2 protein levels whereas fast-twitch muscles express higher levels of Mul1 and low levels of Mfn2 (Lokireddy et al. 2012). The latter phenomenon probably exposes fast muscles to a rapid degradation of Mfn2 with subsequent alteration of mitochondrial fusion, which precedes the fall of PGC-α levels that occurs in the late stages of disuse. Figure 9. Scheme representing the effects of the early stages of disuse on gastrocnemius muscle. Open in a new tab Skeletal muscle disuse would cause down-regulation of pro-fusion proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and AMPK activation. AMPK activation leads to the activation of FoxO, which induces the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in protein degradation via both the autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome pathways. The increase in the rate of protein degradation causes gastrocnemius atrophy. AMPK might also prevent the down-regulation of PGC-1α in gastrocnemius in the early stages of HU. Changes of protein synthesis would not be responsible for gastrocnemius atrophy at this stage of disuse.Moreover, our results show that PGC-1α levels higher than basal are necessary to increase pro-fusion proteins, thus preventing gastrocnemius muscle atrophy during disuse. Interestingly, the higher efficacy of resistance training in preventing muscle mass loss compared to endurance training could be due to the fact that although both types of exercise increase PGC-1α expression, at a given exercise volume the higher the intensity the higher the effect (Egan et al. 2010). As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity were sustained throughout disuse (Fig.6), compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy.Acknowledgments We thank Professor Francesco Zorzato who kindly donated the TgPGC-1α mice and Mr Luigi Guidotti for excellent technical help during all experiments related to muscle disuse.Glossary 4EBP1 eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 ACC acetyl-CoA carboxylase AMPK AMP-activated protein kinase CS citrate synthase CSA cross-sectional area DNP dinitrophenylhydrazone HU hindlimb unloading LC3 microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 Mfn1, Mfn2 mitofusin1 and mitofusin2 MuRF-1 muscle-specific ring finger protein-1 MHC myosin heavy chain OPA1 optic atrophy 1 PGC-1α peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α UPS ubiquitine proteasome system Additional information Competing interests The authors declare no conflict of interest.Author contributions R.B. and M.A.P.: conception and design of the experiments; J.C., L.B. and B.G.: collection, analysis and interpretation of data; R.B. and M.A.P.: drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content.

    "abstract": "Abstract Isolation on Earth can alter physiology and signaling of organs systems, including the central nervous system. Although not in complete solitude, astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female wild-type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are protected from isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression. These findings suggest a key role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in neuroinflammatory responses to spaceflight and prolonged bedrest, isolation, and confinement on Earth.

On Earth, isolation has profound effects on the central nervous system (CNS) including behavioral changes, upregulated oxidative stress pathways, neuroinflammatory responses, as well as brain cytokine alterations1–3. In addition, isolation worsens aging-related cognitive impairments and immune deficits4. Spaceflight also can lead to immune dysfunction as well as reactivation of latent viruses5–8. International Space Station (ISS) crew members on a 6-month spaceflight mission had diminished T/NK cell function9 and increased inflammatory plasma cytokine levels10. In shorter duration missions (9–14 days), changes in the distribution and function of peripheral leukocytes were also detected in astronauts11. Further, the subset of astronauts who experienced viral shedding also displayed increased plasma cytokine protein levels in their plasma during flight12, linking dysregulated cytokine levels with impaired immune function. We showed previously that isolation in combination with simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading (HU) led to a reduction in the percentage of circulating CD4+ immune cells, which was not observed in social housed HU animals13. This finding suggests that isolation can modify immune responses to simulated spaceflight and that the combination of these two spaceflight stressors can lead to discrete immune deficits. However, the combined effects of isolation and microgravity on neuroimmune outcomes are not defined. Excess production of free radicals (e.g., reactive oxygen species, ROS) have been linked to neuroinflammation14. Yet there have been few studies exploring oxidative damage as a mechanism by which space environmental factors, singly or in combination, mediate aspects of CNS immune responses. To address these gaps in knowledge, HU was conducted on paired (social) and single housed wild-type and MCAT mice, a genetic model for mitochondrial ROS quenching. MCAT mice overexpress the human catalase gene targeted to the mitochondria15, a major site of cellular ROS production. MCAT mice display decreased oxidative damage and H2O2 production. The MCAT transgenic model15 was developed to enable testing various aspects of the free radical theory of aging16, which posits that cells, tissues, and organisms age due to an accumulation of oxidative damage via excess production of ROS. Overexpression of catalase when targeted specifically to the mitochondria, but not when targeted to the nucleus or cytoplasm, prolongs murine lifespan and reduces age-related cardiovascular17–19 and cognitive deficits20 sharing features with known or anticipated effects of spaceflight21–25. Findings from human astronauts long ago led to the proposal that spaceflight and advancing age share physiological consequences26, leading us to question if they also share molecular mechanisms. Therefore, we determined whether the MCAT transgene also is protective using a ground-based model that simulates important aspects of spaceflight, microgravity, and isolation. MCAT mice show increased median and maximum lifespans (5 months, and 5.5 months, respectively)15 and are protected from a number of aging-associated pathologies. For example, MCAT mice display protection from cardiovascular deficits17–19 and Alzheimer’s disease-related amyloid deposition27. Further, the brains of MCAT mice indicate the rescue of simulated space radiation-induced decrements in neurogenesis28 and neuronal spine morphology29. The overexpression of catalase also quenches mitochondrial oxidative stress in macrophages30, suggesting that catalase can impact oxidative signaling in inflammatory cells. MCAT mice also exhibit enhanced hippocampal spatial learning, memory, and reduced contextual fear conditioning15,20. Altered cognitive function is thought to be one of the risks associated with long-duration spaceflight31. The production of ROS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and neurotrophic factors are involved in hippocampal neuropathy. Prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity by HU is associated with increased hippocampal oxidative stress biomarkers, which may increase injury32. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus in HU mice reveals changes in structural proteins coupled with the loss of proteins involved in cell metabolism33. In addition, microgravity leads to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairment in animals34. Cytokines are important mediators of both innate and adaptive immunity. They are produced by resident immune cells in the CNS, peripheral tissues, and in circulation35,36. There is emerging evidence that cytokines contribute to the detrimental effects of isolation triggered by disease or injury37,38. For example, hippocampal expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is significantly increased 24 h after ischemia in isolated mice compared to untreated controls, but not in pair-housed mice37,38. In humans as well as animals, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity (bedrest) can lead to changes in cytokine expression10,12,39–42. Therefore, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that isolation and simulated microgravity lead to altered hippocampal cytokine expression via mitochondrial ROS-related mechanisms. Hippocampal alterations, e.g., oxidative damage, spatial changes, and genetic alterations have been reported in both actual and modeled microgravity32,43–46 and linked to behavioral deficits47. These higher CNS functions are critical for astronaut performance during extended periods of spaceflight. Therefore, the hippocampus was selected as the focus of the current study. We found that quenching mitochondrial ROS mitigated the effects of both simulated microgravity and isolation in the hippocampus. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of mitochondrial ROS mechanisms in CNS responses to these stressors, thereby providing a rationale for testing possible use of antioxidants to mitigate CNS risks associated with long-term space exploration as well as bedrest and isolation on Earth.",

    "results": "Results Effects of isolation, microgravity and their combination on hippocampal cytokine levels We performed unbiased hierarchical clustering of cytokine protein expression to gain insight into the impacts of our main experimental variables, loading state (NL: normally loaded or HU), housing environment (single or social housing), and genotype (WT: wild type or MCAT) on the overall cytokine milieu in the hippocampus (Fig. 1). At the highest hierarchical level, samples generally clustered by housing conditions (single or social). Samples within the single housed cluster, formed sub-clusters mostly based on genotype (WT or MCAT), which was not observed in the social housed cluster. Loading state (NL or HU) did not appear to contribute to observed clustering of cytokine expression. Fig. 1. Heatmap showing expression of a panel of 44 cytokines in hippocampus and hierarchical clustering analysis of eight experimental groups. Open in a new tab Except for a few samples, clustering generally occurred by housing environment (single or social). Deeper shades of red: higher cytokine levels, deeper shades of blue: lower cytokine levels, off-white: no change in expression.We first examined the effects of housing environment in all groups (Fig. 2). A comparison between single and social housed mice revealed marked effects of isolation in the hippocampus. Eleven out of 44 cytokines were elevated in wild-type, single housed mice versus the social-housed group (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). These effects were mitigated in MCAT mice. IL-6 (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 3) is provided as a representative example of the expression pattern evident amongst these 11 cytokines. Fig. 2.

Here and in succeeding dot plots, the longer horizontal line in the dot plot corresponds to the group mean while the shorter horizontal lines depict the standard error (SE). Sample sizes are WT NL social (n = 6), WT NL single (n = 3), MCAT NL social (n = 6), and MCAT NL single (n = 4). Some data points overlap. A fit model was generated to include housing state, genotype, loading state, and their pairwise interactions. Interaction effects between housing state and genotype were assessed at p < 0.05. *Statistically significant at p < 0.05 by Tukey post hoc test.Next, we focused on the effects of simulated microgravity and genotype (as main factors and their interactions) on hippocampal cytokine expression in single housed mice (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). When exploring the effect of genotype (main factor) in single housed mice, we found differences in cytokine expression (Fig. 3a), with 13 out of 44 cytokines showing reduced protein levels in single housed MCAT versus wild-type mice (Supplementary Table 5). HU downregulated IL-13 in WT mice. Interestingly, IL-13 levels were lower in MCAT NL mice than in WT NL mice. HU did not appear to cause any further decreases in IL-13 levels of MCAT animals, suggesting mitigation of cytokine changes (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 4). Fig. 3.

Some data points overlap. *Statistically significant at p < 0.05 by two-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test.In social housed animals, simulated microgravity and transgene expression caused changes in the expression of five hippocampal cytokines (Fig. 4a). Four out of these five cytokines (IL-3, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17) were upregulated in HU versus NL mice, and mitigated in MCAT mice (Supplementary Table 6). Results for IL-3 are shown as a representative example of the upregulated cytokines (Fig. 4b). In contrast, (IL-12) was downregulated and this effect also was mitigated in MCAT animals (Supplementary Table 6). Some of the cytokines showed relatively low expression levels (e.g., IL-6, IL-1β, refer to Supplementary Table 1 for full list of cytokines) relative to other cytokines in the panel. These results are consistent with values reported in other studies that suggest biologically relevant effects at these levels of expression48,49.

Effects of isolation, microgravity, and their combination on plasma cytokine levels The same 44-cytokine protein expression analysis was performed on blood plasma to assess possible system-wide effects of simulated microgravity and isolation. Cytokine expression patterns in the plasma differed markedly from those observed in the hippocampus. Figure 5a shows the effects of simulated microgravity and genotype on cytokine plasma expression in single housed mice. In single housed mice, HU upregulated expression of IL-20 and IFN-β1, whereas these effects were not observed in MCAT mice (Supplementary Table 7). In contrast, HU downregulated MDC (macrophage-derived chemokine), which also was mitigated in MCAT mice (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 7). Fractalkine showed a genotype effect (Supplementary Table 8). Fig. 5.

This effect was mitigated in MCAT mice (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 9). Within the 44 cytokines tested, isolation showed less impact on plasma cytokine expression levels than observed in the hippocampus. Fig. 6.

A fit model was created and included housing state, genotype and loading state, and their pairwise interactions. Interaction effects between housing state and genotype were assessed at p < 0.05. Assessment of corticosterone levels in plasma To begin investigating possible underlying stress-related mechanisms, we measured plasma corticosterone levels in all groups (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 11). Corticosterone levels were generally higher in the social groups compared to their corresponding single housed groups (only WT single vs WT social housed HU groups showed no differences). We previously reported that HU of wild-type animals led to increased corticosterone levels13. In the current study, we found that single housed MCAT mice were protected from HU-induced increases in corticosterone levels. Interestingly, social housed MCAT NL mice had higher corticosterone levels versus social housed WT NL mice. However, HU in social housed MCAT mice did not lead to additional increases in corticosterone levels relative to the social MCAT NL group. Refer to Table 1 for a summary of corticosterone results. Measurements of oxidative damage in hippocampus Changes in inflammatory status have been linked to differences in oxidative damage50,51. To determine whether isolation or simulated microgravity caused oxidative damage in the hippocampus, we measured 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adduct levels. Single housed WT animals generally showed higher levels of 4-HNE compared to social housed WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 3A, and Supplementary Table 12). In contrast, 4-HNE levels of single versus social housed MCAT groups were generally comparable. Further, no HU effect was observed (Supplementary Table 13).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Although not in complete solitude, human crew in deep space missions will experience prolonged exposure to environments isolated from Earth and larger social groups. Using a rodent model, we assessed the consequence of isolation alone or in combination with simulated microgravity on the CNS cytokine milieu, a key component of the neuroimmune response. In addition, we sought to determine whether mitochondrial ROS signaling contributed to cytokine responses in the CNS focusing on the hippocampus. Spaceflight is known to cause dysfunction in a variety of tissues52–57. Various regions of the CNS are negatively impacted by microgravity and its simulations. For example, 14 days of HU increased acetylcholine activity in both hippocampus and cortex, which was linked to inferior behavior performances47,58. Our results suggest that isolation is an important stimulus that can evoke changes in the cytokine milieu of the hippocampus, with 11 of 44 immune-modulating cytokines tested showing increased protein expression due to isolation. We also found that compared to social housed mice, isolation increased 4-HNE, an indicator of oxidative damage. Together, these findings indicate that isolation can alter aspects of CNS immune signaling and lead to increased oxidative damage in the CNS. Changes in cytokine signaling in the CNS have been linked to neuroinflammation, neurocognitive decline, reduced ability to recover from brain injuries as well as neuroprotective effects. For example, genetic deletion of IL-6 leads to reduced exploratory behavior and decreased anxiety59. Deletion of IL-2 in mice leads to cognitive deficits that resemble aspects of Alzheimer’s disease60 while disruption of Toll-like receptor signaling by knockout of TLR4 protects against age-related cognitive decline due to neuroinflammation and apoptosis61. Taken together, findings from our study and others suggest that isolation poses a risk to CNS health. Isolation and HU led to discrete sets of differentially expressed cytokines in hippocampus, suggesting different immunoregulatory mechanisms invoked by each of these stressors. Collectively, the cytokines differentially expressed in response to HU or isolation as single factors are known to play roles in immune regulation, inflammatory disease and also are impacted by spaceflight. (Refer to ref. 62 for a recent review on the functions of interleukins and other cytokines). For example, circulating IL-20 protein levels (elevated by HU in our current study) are also increased at the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis and decreased after 6 months of treatment63,64. Further, IL-3 protein levels are greater in splenocytes and thymocytes from space-flown rats than ground controls65. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from astronauts onboard the ISS, IL-10 is reduced following lipopolysaccharide stimulation compared to controls7. Thus, our observations that simulated weightlessness and isolation provoke expression of discrete cytokine repertoires is consistent with our previous findings on immune cell responses using these models13. At the timepoint examined in this study, isolation had a more pronounced impact than HU on the expression of cytokines in the hippocampus, as indicated by differential expression of 11 cytokines as a result of isolation (single housed compared to social housed NL groups) versus 5 cytokines due to HU (social housed HU compared to NL groups). In addition, HU under single and social housed conditions resulted in distinct sets of differentially expressed cytokines in the hippocampus. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that simulated weightlessness and isolation activate discrete molecular and physiological mechanisms to regulate cytokine production. We found that cytokine responses to spaceflight stressors in the hippocampus versus circulation were also discrete under the experimental conditions used in this study. Further, isolation-induced cytokine responses were more extensive in the hippocampus compared to the plasma, based on the higher number of cytokines affected (11 and 3, respectively). Although only a single timepoint (30 days) was assessed in this study, our findings raise the possibility that changes in cytokine levels in the circulation may not mirror those in the brain during spaceflight. The 30 day HU period is considered a chronic exposure paradigm given that it accounts for 4% of an animal’s lifespan (assuming a 2 year lifespan). For perspective, a trip to Mars can take about two years, corresponding to 2.5% of a human lifespan (assuming 80 years as the average human lifespan). Our study is the first to implicate mitochondrial ROS in the CNS and in circulating cytokine levels brought about by combined isolation and simulated microgravity. MCAT mice exhibited protection from the hippocampal cytokine changes caused by isolation, simulated microgravity, and in combination. In plasma, HU-induced changes in cytokine expression were mitigated in MCAT mice. In the hippocampus of single housed MCAT mice, both IL-6 and TNFα show reduced expression relative to housing matched wild-type controls. Both of these cytokines are known to play a role in inflammation (chronic and acute) and in autoimmunity. In the same mice cohort we also found that HU elevated circulating neutrophils and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), suggesting increased inflammation while this effect was mitigated in MCAT mice66. Taken together, our findings are consistent with our hypothesis, highlighting the important role of ROS in modulating systemic and neuroimmune responses to simulated spaceflight. Our study contributes new information on the regulation of cytokine expression in the hippocampus in MCAT mice, a widely used genetic model for quenching mitochondrial ROS and studying diseases related to aging. MCAT mice have increased mean and maximum lifespan15, enhanced hippocampal spatial learning and memory, reduced contextual fear conditioning, delayed lung cancer onset67, and delayed age-related cardiac and ocular pathologies15. Some of the downregulated cytokines we observed in MCAT mice contribute to the cancer microenvironment (e.g., IL-6, INFγ, M-CSF, TNFα)67 and other metabolic diseases. For example, MCP-1 and IL-6 contribute to the development of abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism68–70. Future studies could be conducted to test ROS-mediated modulation of the cytokine milieu as a potential mechanism for the resistance of MCAT mice to the abovementioned aging-related pathologies. In addition, our findings and those of others provide a rationale for future investigations on ROS quenching as a potential approach to mitigate inflammaging, the chronic low-grade inflammation associated with aging21. As we have reported previously, HU increased circulating corticosterone levels of WT mice after 30 days regardless of housing environment13. This effect was mitigated in MCAT single housed mice. In social housed NL animals, corticosterone levels were generally higher compared to the corresponding single housed group. The underlying basis for the higher corticosterone levels in these social housed mice versus single housed mice is unclear. Social hierarchy may exist between pair-housed female mice71, which may elevate the average corticosterone levels in paired housing versus single housing conditions. The social MCAT NL and HU groups had comparable corticosterone levels. HU in social housed MCAT mice did not lead to further increases in corticosterone levels possibly due to maximum upregulation of the HPA axis and/or a protective effect by the MCAT genotype. Interestingly, increased plasma corticosterone levels were observed in social housed mice even as plasma levels of an oxidative damage marker (4-HNE) and a subset of inflammatory cytokine protein levels in the hippocampus generally decreased. This suggests that elevated stress-associated hormones need not always coincide with pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative states. This also raises the possibility that the increase in corticosterone levels in social housed groups is not a pathological response. The underlying mechanisms for the inverse relationship of corticosterone with both oxidative damage and inflammatory cytokines require further study. Female mice were selected for this study. Sex-specific differences in rodent responses to isolation can occur72,73. In humans, males and females show some differences in their responses to confinement74 and bedrest, another microgravity analog75,76. Therefore, future investigations are needed to assess the sex-dependent effects of isolation and microgravity as well as any possible differences in oxidative stress responses. In summary, isolation and long-term simulated microgravity via HU altered cytokine expression levels in both the hippocampus and plasma. These effects in the brain were mitigated in MCAT mice, implicating an important role for mitochondrial ROS in aspects of the neuroimmune response to microgravity and isolation. Taken together, our findings and those of others provide a rationale for the use of antioxidant-based approaches to address anticipated CNS changes during spaceflight and in situations of isolation and reduced mobility on Earth.",

Copyright notice ID: 8260663 PMID: 34230490 Abstract Isolation on Earth can alter physiology and signaling of organs systems, including the central nervous system. Although not in complete solitude, astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female wild-type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are protected from isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression. These findings suggest a key role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in neuroinflammatory responses to spaceflight and prolonged bedrest, isolation, and confinement on Earth. Subject terms: Interleukins, PhysiologyIntroduction Isolation is an important feature of the spaceflight environment. Interplanetary missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will involve mission crew operating in isolated environments for prolonged periods of time. On Earth, isolation has profound effects on the central nervous system (CNS) including behavioral changes, upregulated oxidative stress pathways, neuroinflammatory responses, as well as brain cytokine alterations1–3. In addition, isolation worsens aging-related cognitive impairments and immune deficits4. Spaceflight also can lead to immune dysfunction as well as reactivation of latent viruses5–8. International Space Station (ISS) crew members on a 6-month spaceflight mission had diminished T/NK cell function9 and increased inflammatory plasma cytokine levels10. In shorter duration missions (9–14 days), changes in the distribution and function of peripheral leukocytes were also detected in astronauts11. Further, the subset of astronauts who experienced viral shedding also displayed increased plasma cytokine protein levels in their plasma during flight12, linking dysregulated cytokine levels with impaired immune function. We showed previously that isolation in combination with simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading (HU) led to a reduction in the percentage of circulating CD4+ immune cells, which was not observed in social housed HU animals13. This finding suggests that isolation can modify immune responses to simulated spaceflight and that the combination of these two spaceflight stressors can lead to discrete immune deficits. However, the combined effects of isolation and microgravity on neuroimmune outcomes are not defined. Excess production of free radicals (e.g., reactive oxygen species, ROS) have been linked to neuroinflammation14. Yet there have been few studies exploring oxidative damage as a mechanism by which space environmental factors, singly or in combination, mediate aspects of CNS immune responses. To address these gaps in knowledge, HU was conducted on paired (social) and single housed wild-type and MCAT mice, a genetic model for mitochondrial ROS quenching. MCAT mice overexpress the human catalase gene targeted to the mitochondria15, a major site of cellular ROS production. MCAT mice display decreased oxidative damage and H2O2 production. The MCAT transgenic model15 was developed to enable testing various aspects of the free radical theory of aging16, which posits that cells, tissues, and organisms age due to an accumulation of oxidative damage via excess production of ROS. Overexpression of catalase when targeted specifically to the mitochondria, but not when targeted to the nucleus or cytoplasm, prolongs murine lifespan and reduces age-related cardiovascular17–19 and cognitive deficits20 sharing features with known or anticipated effects of spaceflight21–25. Findings from human astronauts long ago led to the proposal that spaceflight and advancing age share physiological consequences26, leading us to question if they also share molecular mechanisms. Therefore, we determined whether the MCAT transgene also is protective using a ground-based model that simulates important aspects of spaceflight, microgravity, and isolation. MCAT mice show increased median and maximum lifespans (5 months, and 5.5 months, respectively)15 and are protected from a number of aging-associated pathologies. For example, MCAT mice display protection from cardiovascular deficits17–19 and Alzheimer’s disease-related amyloid deposition27. Further, the brains of MCAT mice indicate the rescue of simulated space radiation-induced decrements in neurogenesis28 and neuronal spine morphology29. The overexpression of catalase also quenches mitochondrial oxidative stress in macrophages30, suggesting that catalase can impact oxidative signaling in inflammatory cells. MCAT mice also exhibit enhanced hippocampal spatial learning, memory, and reduced contextual fear conditioning15,20. Altered cognitive function is thought to be one of the risks associated with long-duration spaceflight31. The production of ROS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and neurotrophic factors are involved in hippocampal neuropathy. Prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity by HU is associated with increased hippocampal oxidative stress biomarkers, which may increase injury32. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus in HU mice reveals changes in structural proteins coupled with the loss of proteins involved in cell metabolism33. In addition, microgravity leads to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairment in animals34. Cytokines are important mediators of both innate and adaptive immunity. They are produced by resident immune cells in the CNS, peripheral tissues, and in circulation35,36. There is emerging evidence that cytokines contribute to the detrimental effects of isolation triggered by disease or injury37,38. For example, hippocampal expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is significantly increased 24 h after ischemia in isolated mice compared to untreated controls, but not in pair-housed mice37,38. In humans as well as animals, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity (bedrest) can lead to changes in cytokine expression10,12,39–42. Therefore, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that isolation and simulated microgravity lead to altered hippocampal cytokine expression via mitochondrial ROS-related mechanisms. Hippocampal alterations, e.g., oxidative damage, spatial changes, and genetic alterations have been reported in both actual and modeled microgravity32,43–46 and linked to behavioral deficits47. These higher CNS functions are critical for astronaut performance during extended periods of spaceflight. Therefore, the hippocampus was selected as the focus of the current study. We found that quenching mitochondrial ROS mitigated the effects of both simulated microgravity and isolation in the hippocampus. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of mitochondrial ROS mechanisms in CNS responses to these stressors, thereby providing a rationale for testing possible use of antioxidants to mitigate CNS risks associated with long-term space exploration as well as bedrest and isolation on Earth.Results Effects of isolation, microgravity and their combination on hippocampal cytokine levels We performed unbiased hierarchical clustering of cytokine protein expression to gain insight into the impacts of our main experimental variables, loading state (NL: normally loaded or HU), housing environment (single or social housing), and genotype (WT: wild type or MCAT) on the overall cytokine milieu in the hippocampus (Fig. 1). At the highest hierarchical level, samples generally clustered by housing conditions (single or social). Samples within the single housed cluster, formed sub-clusters mostly based on genotype (WT or MCAT), which was not observed in the social housed cluster. Loading state (NL or HU) did not appear to contribute to observed clustering of cytokine expression. Fig. 1. Heatmap showing expression of a panel of 44 cytokines in hippocampus and hierarchical clustering analysis of eight experimental groups. Open in a new tab Except for a few samples, clustering generally occurred by housing environment (single or social). Deeper shades of red: higher cytokine levels, deeper shades of blue: lower cytokine levels, off-white: no change in expression.We first examined the effects of housing environment in all groups (Fig. 2). A comparison between single and social housed mice revealed marked effects of isolation in the hippocampus. Eleven out of 44 cytokines were elevated in wild-type, single housed mice versus the social-housed group (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). These effects were mitigated in MCAT mice. IL-6 (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 3) is provided as a representative example of the expression pattern evident amongst these 11 cytokines. Fig. 2.

Here and in succeeding dot plots, the longer horizontal line in the dot plot corresponds to the group mean while the shorter horizontal lines depict the standard error (SE). Sample sizes are WT NL social (n = 6), WT NL single (n = 3), MCAT NL social (n = 6), and MCAT NL single (n = 4). Some data points overlap. A fit model was generated to include housing state, genotype, loading state, and their pairwise interactions. Interaction effects between housing state and genotype were assessed at p < 0.05. *Statistically significant at p < 0.05 by Tukey post hoc test.Next, we focused on the effects of simulated microgravity and genotype (as main factors and their interactions) on hippocampal cytokine expression in single housed mice (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). When exploring the effect of genotype (main factor) in single housed mice, we found differences in cytokine expression (Fig. 3a), with 13 out of 44 cytokines showing reduced protein levels in single housed MCAT versus wild-type mice (Supplementary Table 5). HU downregulated IL-13 in WT mice. Interestingly, IL-13 levels were lower in MCAT NL mice than in WT NL mice. HU did not appear to cause any further decreases in IL-13 levels of MCAT animals, suggesting mitigation of cytokine changes (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 4). Fig. 3.

Some data points overlap. *Statistically significant at p < 0.05 by two-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test.In social housed animals, simulated microgravity and transgene expression caused changes in the expression of five hippocampal cytokines (Fig. 4a). Four out of these five cytokines (IL-3, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17) were upregulated in HU versus NL mice, and mitigated in MCAT mice (Supplementary Table 6). Results for IL-3 are shown as a representative example of the upregulated cytokines (Fig. 4b). In contrast, (IL-12) was downregulated and this effect also was mitigated in MCAT animals (Supplementary Table 6). Some of the cytokines showed relatively low expression levels (e.g., IL-6, IL-1β, refer to Supplementary Table 1 for full list of cytokines) relative to other cytokines in the panel. These results are consistent with values reported in other studies that suggest biologically relevant effects at these levels of expression48,49. Table 1 summarizes the results of cytokine analysis of hippocampus. Fig. 4.

Effects of isolation, microgravity, and their combination on plasma cytokine levels The same 44-cytokine protein expression analysis was performed on blood plasma to assess possible system-wide effects of simulated microgravity and isolation. Cytokine expression patterns in the plasma differed markedly from those observed in the hippocampus. Figure 5a shows the effects of simulated microgravity and genotype on cytokine plasma expression in single housed mice. In single housed mice, HU upregulated expression of IL-20 and IFN-β1, whereas these effects were not observed in MCAT mice (Supplementary Table 7). In contrast, HU downregulated MDC (macrophage-derived chemokine), which also was mitigated in MCAT mice (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 7). Fractalkine showed a genotype effect (Supplementary Table 8). Fig. 5.

This effect was mitigated in MCAT mice (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 9). Within the 44 cytokines tested, isolation showed less impact on plasma cytokine expression levels than observed in the hippocampus. Fig. 6.

A fit model was created and included housing state, genotype and loading state, and their pairwise interactions. Interaction effects between housing state and genotype were assessed at p < 0.05.Assessment of corticosterone levels in plasma To begin investigating possible underlying stress-related mechanisms, we measured plasma corticosterone levels in all groups (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 11). Corticosterone levels were generally higher in the social groups compared to their corresponding single housed groups (only WT single vs WT social housed HU groups showed no differences). We previously reported that HU of wild-type animals led to increased corticosterone levels13. In the current study, we found that single housed MCAT mice were protected from HU-induced increases in corticosterone levels. Interestingly, social housed MCAT NL mice had higher corticosterone levels versus social housed WT NL mice. However, HU in social housed MCAT mice did not lead to additional increases in corticosterone levels relative to the social MCAT NL group. Refer to Table 1 for a summary of corticosterone results.Measurements of oxidative damage in hippocampus Changes in inflammatory status have been linked to differences in oxidative damage50,51. To determine whether isolation or simulated microgravity caused oxidative damage in the hippocampus, we measured 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adduct levels. Single housed WT animals generally showed higher levels of 4-HNE compared to social housed WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 3A, and Supplementary Table 12). In contrast, 4-HNE levels of single versus social housed MCAT groups were generally comparable. Further, no HU effect was observed (Supplementary Table 13).Discussion Although not in complete solitude, human crew in deep space missions will experience prolonged exposure to environments isolated from Earth and larger social groups. Using a rodent model, we assessed the consequence of isolation alone or in combination with simulated microgravity on the CNS cytokine milieu, a key component of the neuroimmune response. In addition, we sought to determine whether mitochondrial ROS signaling contributed to cytokine responses in the CNS focusing on the hippocampus. Spaceflight is known to cause dysfunction in a variety of tissues52–57. Various regions of the CNS are negatively impacted by microgravity and its simulations. For example, 14 days of HU increased acetylcholine activity in both hippocampus and cortex, which was linked to inferior behavior performances47,58. Our results suggest that isolation is an important stimulus that can evoke changes in the cytokine milieu of the hippocampus, with 11 of 44 immune-modulating cytokines tested showing increased protein expression due to isolation. We also found that compared to social housed mice, isolation increased 4-HNE, an indicator of oxidative damage. Together, these findings indicate that isolation can alter aspects of CNS immune signaling and lead to increased oxidative damage in the CNS. Changes in cytokine signaling in the CNS have been linked to neuroinflammation, neurocognitive decline, reduced ability to recover from brain injuries as well as neuroprotective effects. For example, genetic deletion of IL-6 leads to reduced exploratory behavior and decreased anxiety59. Deletion of IL-2 in mice leads to cognitive deficits that resemble aspects of Alzheimer’s disease60 while disruption of Toll-like receptor signaling by knockout of TLR4 protects against age-related cognitive decline due to neuroinflammation and apoptosis61. Taken together, findings from our study and others suggest that isolation poses a risk to CNS health. Isolation and HU led to discrete sets of differentially expressed cytokines in hippocampus, suggesting different immunoregulatory mechanisms invoked by each of these stressors. Collectively, the cytokines differentially expressed in response to HU or isolation as single factors are known to play roles in immune regulation, inflammatory disease and also are impacted by spaceflight. (Refer to ref. 62 for a recent review on the functions of interleukins and other cytokines). For example, circulating IL-20 protein levels (elevated by HU in our current study) are also increased at the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis and decreased after 6 months of treatment63,64. Further, IL-3 protein levels are greater in splenocytes and thymocytes from space-flown rats than ground controls65. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from astronauts onboard the ISS, IL-10 is reduced following lipopolysaccharide stimulation compared to controls7. Thus, our observations that simulated weightlessness and isolation provoke expression of discrete cytokine repertoires is consistent with our previous findings on immune cell responses using these models13. At the timepoint examined in this study, isolation had a more pronounced impact than HU on the expression of cytokines in the hippocampus, as indicated by differential expression of 11 cytokines as a result of isolation (single housed compared to social housed NL groups) versus 5 cytokines due to HU (social housed HU compared to NL groups). In addition, HU under single and social housed conditions resulted in distinct sets of differentially expressed cytokines in the hippocampus. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that simulated weightlessness and isolation activate discrete molecular and physiological mechanisms to regulate cytokine production. We found that cytokine responses to spaceflight stressors in the hippocampus versus circulation were also discrete under the experimental conditions used in this study. Further, isolation-induced cytokine responses were more extensive in the hippocampus compared to the plasma, based on the higher number of cytokines affected (11 and 3, respectively). Although only a single timepoint (30 days) was assessed in this study, our findings raise the possibility that changes in cytokine levels in the circulation may not mirror those in the brain during spaceflight. The 30 day HU period is considered a chronic exposure paradigm given that it accounts for 4% of an animal’s lifespan (assuming a 2 year lifespan). For perspective, a trip to Mars can take about two years, corresponding to 2.5% of a human lifespan (assuming 80 years as the average human lifespan). Our study is the first to implicate mitochondrial ROS in the CNS and in circulating cytokine levels brought about by combined isolation and simulated microgravity. MCAT mice exhibited protection from the hippocampal cytokine changes caused by isolation, simulated microgravity, and in combination. In plasma, HU-induced changes in cytokine expression were mitigated in MCAT mice. In the hippocampus of single housed MCAT mice, both IL-6 and TNFα show reduced expression relative to housing matched wild-type controls. Both of these cytokines are known to play a role in inflammation (chronic and acute) and in autoimmunity. In the same mice cohort we also found that HU elevated circulating neutrophils and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), suggesting increased inflammation while this effect was mitigated in MCAT mice66. Taken together, our findings are consistent with our hypothesis, highlighting the important role of ROS in modulating systemic and neuroimmune responses to simulated spaceflight. Our study contributes new information on the regulation of cytokine expression in the hippocampus in MCAT mice, a widely used genetic model for quenching mitochondrial ROS and studying diseases related to aging. MCAT mice have increased mean and maximum lifespan15, enhanced hippocampal spatial learning and memory, reduced contextual fear conditioning, delayed lung cancer onset67, and delayed age-related cardiac and ocular pathologies15. Some of the downregulated cytokines we observed in MCAT mice contribute to the cancer microenvironment (e.g., IL-6, INFγ, M-CSF, TNFα)67 and other metabolic diseases. For example, MCP-1 and IL-6 contribute to the development of abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism68–70. Future studies could be conducted to test ROS-mediated modulation of the cytokine milieu as a potential mechanism for the resistance of MCAT mice to the abovementioned aging-related pathologies. In addition, our findings and those of others provide a rationale for future investigations on ROS quenching as a potential approach to mitigate inflammaging, the chronic low-grade inflammation associated with aging21. As we have reported previously, HU increased circulating corticosterone levels of WT mice after 30 days regardless of housing environment13. This effect was mitigated in MCAT single housed mice. In social housed NL animals, corticosterone levels were generally higher compared to the corresponding single housed group. The underlying basis for the higher corticosterone levels in these social housed mice versus single housed mice is unclear. Social hierarchy may exist between pair-housed female mice71, which may elevate the average corticosterone levels in paired housing versus single housing conditions. The social MCAT NL and HU groups had comparable corticosterone levels. HU in social housed MCAT mice did not lead to further increases in corticosterone levels possibly due to maximum upregulation of the HPA axis and/or a protective effect by the MCAT genotype. Interestingly, increased plasma corticosterone levels were observed in social housed mice even as plasma levels of an oxidative damage marker (4-HNE) and a subset of inflammatory cytokine protein levels in the hippocampus generally decreased. This suggests that elevated stress-associated hormones need not always coincide with pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative states. This also raises the possibility that the increase in corticosterone levels in social housed groups is not a pathological response. The underlying mechanisms for the inverse relationship of corticosterone with both oxidative damage and inflammatory cytokines require further study. Female mice were selected for this study. Sex-specific differences in rodent responses to isolation can occur72,73. In humans, males and females show some differences in their responses to confinement74 and bedrest, another microgravity analog75,76. Therefore, future investigations are needed to assess the sex-dependent effects of isolation and microgravity as well as any possible differences in oxidative stress responses. In summary, isolation and long-term simulated microgravity via HU altered cytokine expression levels in both the hippocampus and plasma. These effects in the brain were mitigated in MCAT mice, implicating an important role for mitochondrial ROS in aspects of the neuroimmune response to microgravity and isolation. Taken together, our findings and those of others provide a rationale for the use of antioxidant-based approaches to address anticipated CNS changes during spaceflight and in situations of isolation and reduced mobility on Earth.Materials and methods Animals and strains Female wild-type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT transgenic mice were included in this study. MCAT mice overexpress human catalase localized to the mitochondria15. Wild type (WT) and MCAT mice for use in the experiments were generated at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) by crossing male MCAT mice, B6.Cg-Tg (CAG-OTC/CAT) 4033Prab/J with female C57BL/6NJ mice (from Jackson Laboratory; stocks 016197 and 005304, respectively). Genotyping was performed using the Red’N Amp PCR kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Millipore-Sigma). All animal procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at ARC. The approved animal protocols associated with this study are NAS-16-006 and NAS-16-007.Hindlimb unloading Sixteen-week-old female wild-type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT mice on C57BL/6NJ background were assigned to one of eight experimental groups, and housed either individually (single housed) or in pairs (social housed) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Females were selected for this study in part because the majority of rodent studies to date on simulated and actual weightlessness have used females. The wild-type groups in this study were the same animals used in our previous report which focused on the assessment of musculoskeletal outcomes and flow cytometry-based immune cell profiling in response to isolation13. The traditional NASA Ames HU cage system was used for single housed HU animals77, while normally loaded (NL) single housed controls were maintained single housed in standard vivarium cages. A separate validation experiment confirmed that NL mice housed in standard vivarium cages or in HU cages did not differ in body weights, plasma corticosterone levels, soleus mass, bone structure, and immune cell populations in peripheral blood (data not shown). A custom caging system as we had previously described13, was used for social housed, HU mice (pairs). Social housed, NL controls were maintained in standard vivarium cages in pairs as controls for the social HU mice. Animals assigned to HU groups were acclimated for 3 days in HU cages but without unloading, prior to the onset of HU. Room temperature was maintained at a range of 23–24 °C with a 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Nestlests (Ancare) were provided as enrichment for the animals. Animal weights and food consumption were monitored throughout the duration of the experiment. Animals were euthanized 30 days after the onset of HU via CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation.Sample collection and analysis HU was initiated across three consecutive days with equal numbers of wild-type and MCAT mice (similar ages) on any given day to accommodate the large number of animals in this study. All experimental groups experienced the same length of treatments (e.g., HU). Consequently, dissections were performed across 3 consecutive days. The left brain hemisphere was flash frozen and a tissue biopsy (1.20 mm Harris micro punch) from the hippocampus was performed inside a cryotome chamber set at −20 °C to avoid thawing. Hippocampal tissue was then homogenized in mild lysis buffer (Tris 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Igepal 1%), Protease Inhibitors (Millipore-Sigma)78. Samples were then centrifuged at 4 °C at 1000 × g for 10 min and supernatants aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Cytokine protein abundance in hippocampal homogenates were analyzed using a Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Array 44-Plex-MD44 (EVE Technologies), and concentration standards run for each cytokine. IL-3 cytokine expression was validated by ELISA (Abcam, Cat# ab113345-IL-3). Hippocampal cytokine levels were normalized to total protein content as determined by BCA assay. Blood was collected from the vena cava immediately after euthanasia. Undiluted plasma was analyzed for cytokine protein abundance as employed for hippocampal homogenates.Statistical analysis for cytokine analysis Statistical analysis of cytokine expression was performed using JMP (SAS), Version 14.0.0. Equal variance was first evaluated by Levene’s test and normality assessed by Shapiro–Wilk goodness of fit test. If equal variance and normality were met, a fit model was performed taking into account the three main effects: loading state (NL or HU), housing (single or social), and genotype (WT or MCAT) and comparisons between the main effects done two at a time (two-way ANOVA) (Supplementary Fig. 1). A two-way ANOVA was selected since we were interested in understanding how one factor interacted with one other factor. The threshold of statistical significance for both main factor and interaction effects was set at p < 0.05. If interaction effects were evident, a Tukey post hoc test was performed at p < 0.05. If a main effect was evident, a Dunnett’s test was applied to determine differences between groups of that main effect. A two-way ANOVA also was conducted to evaluate the effects of loading state (NL or HU), genotype (WT or MCAT), and loading state × genotype on the four single housed groups (Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly, a two-way ANOVA was performed on the four social housed groups (Supplementary Fig. 1). For datasets with unequal variance and/or non-normal distributions, a non-parametric Wilcoxon all pairs test was performed with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Refer to Supplementary Tables 1–13 for more info on p values and summary of the statistical testing applied in this study.Depiction of cytokine results: Venn diagrams On the basis of results derived from two-way ANOVA, statistically significant differences in cytokine abundance were summarized in Venn diagrams. As described specifically in each figure and legend, each circle in the diagram represents groups combined according to the various main factors, i.e., loading state (NL or HU, described as Simulated Microgravity effects), or housing (single or social, described as Isolation effects), or genotype (WT or MCAT, described as Genotype effects), with specific cytokines affected by the factors listed within each circle. The intersect of two circles depicts which cytokines were affected by both main factors. A crossbar abutting the intersect of the circles depicts findings that differences in cytokine levels common to both main factors were mitigated in MCAT mice relative to WT mice.Assays for oxidative damage Hippocampal homogenates were analyzed for ROS and related products. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adduct was measured by OxiSelect HNE Adduct Competitive ELISA (Cell Biolabs, Cat# STA-838).Assay for plasma corticosterone Plasma corticosterone was analyzed in 1:100 diluted plasma by ELISA (Abcam, Cat# ab108821).Statistical analysis for corticosterone and assays for oxidative damage Statistical analysis as performed using JMP (SAS), Version 14.0.0. Equal variance was first evaluated by Levene’s test and normality assessed by Shapiro–Wilk goodness of fit test. For 4-HNE results, a linear fit model was created using a least squares approach, and involved the three main variables (loading, housing environment, genotype) and their pairwise interactions (2 × 2 × 2 analysis of variance, ANOVA). If interaction effects were observed (p < 0.05), a Tukey post hoc test was performed. For corticosterone results, a non-parametric Wilcoxon all pairs test was performed with statistical significance set at p < 0.05.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary information (439.2KB, pdf) Reporting Summary (71.9KB, pdf) Acknowledgements This work was funded by a grant from the NASA Space Biology Program (R.K.G., C.G.T.T.).

    "abstract": "Abstract N6-threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) is one of the few RNA modifications that is universally present in life. This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon–codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the Drosophila ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1. kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of Drosophila Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent kae1 melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand, kae1 mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1, whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease.

Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1, whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease. Keywords: Drosophila, Kae1, N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine, t6AINTRODUCTION Beyond the four canonical ribonucleosides present in RNA, nearly all life forms bear an array of modified bases in various transcript populations. Over 100 chemical modifications have been documented, with dozens often present in individual species; the majority of distinct modified ribonucleosides occur on tRNA (Machnicka et al. 2013). Altogether, RNA modifications collectively play diverse roles in RNA quality control, secondary structure, transcript stability, translational efficiency, translational fidelity, and regulation of RNA–protein interactions (Gu et al. 2014; Hopper and Huang 2015) and can influence disease and cancer progression (Grewal 2015; Kirchner and Ignatova 2015). While many post-transcriptional modifications of RNA are broadly conserved, only a few are universal across known life forms. One prominent example is N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A), which is found at high frequency at position 37 of tRNAs that decode ANN codons (Grosjean et al. 1995). This modification was recognized decades ago, and it stabilizes cognate codon–anticodon interactions through a stacking interaction that stabilizes the weak interaction with the first codon base, which comprises a weak A–U pair (Weissenbach and Grosjean 1981; Yarian et al. 2002; Agris 2008). However, the enzymes that generate this modification remained elusive until relatively recently. Based on the inference that all organisms harbor t6A-modified tRNAs (Sprinzl and Vassilenko 2005), bioinformatic isolation of universally conserved genes of unknown function (Galperin and Koonin 2004) yielded a short list of candidate genes that first led to the identification of YrdC/Sua5 as a t6A pathway component (El Yacoubi et al. 2009). Subsequently, members of the universal gene family Kae1/Qri7/YgjD were recognized to be essential for t6A biosynthesis, along with its partner proteins (in yeast) Pcc1 and Bud32 (El Yacoubi et al. 2011; Srinivasan et al. 2011). Of note, mutations in components of the Kae1, Pcc1, Bud32, and Cgi121 complex (collectively termed KEOPS) had been isolated some years earlier, via divergent approaches intended at identifying factors in telomere maintenance (Downey et al. 2006) and splicing/transcription (Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006). At the time, the molecular role of the KEOPS complex was obscure, but its deep conservation justified solving the atomic structures of the archaeal Kae1/Bud32 natural fusion protein (Hecker et al. 2008) and the entire eukaryotic KEOPS complex (Mao et al. 2008). These studies assigned Kae1 as an ASKHA-type ATPase, Bud32 as a kinase, and Pcc1 as a dimerization subunit, with Kae1 physically interacting with both Bud32 and Pcc1. Only later, with the recognition that these genes are involved in t6A accumulation, did efforts become possible to reconstitute the biosynthesis of t6A-modified tRNA in vitro, using purified bacterial YrdC (Sua5) and YgjD (Kae1) and two bacterial-specific genes that cluster with YgjD, namely YjeE and YeaZ (Deutsch et al. 2012). Similarly, yeast Sua5 and KEOPS complex sufficed to generate t6A-modified tRNA in vitro (Perrochia et al. 2013). The proposed mechanism is that Sua5 converts bicarbonate and threonine via a series of intermediates into threonylcarbamoyladenylate, which is transferred to the active site of Kae1 within the KEOPS complex to modify tRNA position A37. Notably, Kae1 is the only truly universally conserved component of KEOPS (Galperin and Koonin 2004), and eukaryotes contain a paralog of Kae1 termed Qri7 that is mitochondrially localized (Huh et al. 2003). The fact that no other KEOPS components localize to mitochondria led to a suspicion that Qri7 represents a primal core factor that does not require additional presumably accessory KEOPS components. Indeed, subcellular redirection of Qri7 to the cytoplasm rescued the slow growth phenotypes of all KEOPS members that are defective for t6A accumulation (Wan et al. 2013). Moreover, in vitro synthesis of t6A-modified tRNA was reconstituted solely with purified Sua5, Qri7, and substrate tRNA, in the presence of threonine, bicarbonate, and ATP (Wan et al. 2013). Thus, Kae1/Qri7 is the central downstream enzyme in the generation of t6A-modified tRNA. The assignment of core genes in the t6A pathway permits organismal phenotypes to be correlated with the absence of these modified tRNAs. Budding yeast t6A pathway mutants (El Yacoubi et al. 2009, 2011; Srinivasan et al. 2011) are very slow-growing, while the bacterial pathway (e.g., in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli) is essential for viability and cell morphology (Arigoni et al. 1998; Handford et al. 2009). These seemingly general defects befit loss of a fundamental RNA modification pathway, but do not lend insight into particular processes. Otherwise, mutants of KEOPS complex members in single-celled organisms have impact on telomere maintenance (Downey et al. 2006), transcription (Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006), and genome stability (Oberto et al. 2009), although it remains unclear how directly the loss of t6A relates to these phenotypes. However, certain phenotypes now seem to be directly related to the biochemical function of t6A in improving translational fidelity. Of note, yeast sua5 was originally isolated as a suppressor of cyc1 alleles harboring an aberrant upstream start codon (uORF) (Hampsey et al. 1991; Na et al. 1992), implicating Sua5 in start site selection; AUG is indeed recognized by a t6A-modified tRNA. Correspondingly, Sua5 affects various aspects of normal translation, as mutants exhibit increased leaky scanning through AUG, frameshifting, and nonsense suppression (Lin et al. 2010). One prominent locus controlled via endogenous uORFs is the amino acid starvation-responsive transcription factor GCN4 (Hinnebusch 2005). Indeed, not only does sua5 derepress GCN4, KEOPS mutants (kae1 and pcc1) induce a gene expression signature that is substantially enriched for Gcn4 targets (Daugeron et al. 2011). These precedents suggest that it may be possible to make linkages between altered translation and organismal phenotypes, even for this “housekeeping” cellular activity. To date, genetic analysis of t6A pathway components has mostly been limited to single cell organisms, such as microbes and yeast. One study on the Drosophila melanogaster Bud32/PRPK homolog utilized RNAi-mediated knockdowns to define growth related defects upon bud32 depletion, although biochemical evidence was not presented for an impact on t6A biogenesis in this condition (Ibar et al. 2013). Interestingly, the growth defects were related to PI3K/TOR signaling, and could be partially restored by expression of activated S6-kinase (Ibar et al. 2013). In this study, we describe the isolation of a large allelic series of D. melanogaster kae1 mutants, ranging from weak hypomorphs, strong mutants, to null alleles. These present various growth-related defects, developmental delay, and melanotic tumors. We present extensive biochemical and genetic evidence that Drosophila kae1 and its partners are core factors in t6A biogenesis. Notably, our phenotypic analysis reveals substantial differences in the genetic requirements for t6A in proliferating versus nonproliferating tissues. In particular, analysis of mitotic tissues in full knockout and in clonal settings indicates an essential requirement for kae1, whereas various nonproliferating tissues can be maintained in the null state for weeks. Moreover, kae1 appears to act as a tumor suppressor in the larval hematopoietic tissue. These data highlight biological complexity in the requirements of a general regulatory factor, and the utility of the Drosophila model to further understand the roles of t6A modification during animal development and disease.RESULTS Isolation of the “Black Spot” complementation group During efforts to isolate mutants in the 72D-F region, we conducted an F2 EMS mutagenesis screen against Df(3L)ED220, which deletes 324,210 bp of chromosome 3L:16,080,584–16,404,777 (see Materials and Methods). We screened ∼7000 crosses of animals bearing mutagenized chromosomes to this deficiency, and recovered 64 lethals. Within this collection, we recognized numerous alleles for which hemizygous larvae bore characteristic melanotic masses, which we colloquially termed “Black Spot” mutants (Fig. 1A). These mutants failed to complement each other, and they typically exhibited an extended larval period prior to lethality (Fig. 1B–D; Supplemental Fig. 1). Notably, while Drosophila larvae complete their larval stages around day 5 and commence pupation, some Black Spot mutants survive as larvae for up to 18 d. Systematic tests against all of the lethal alleles we obtained in this genomic interval revealed additional noncomplementing mutations. Many of these mutants lacked black spots or generated them with low frequency (Fig. 1B–D). Several of these alleles were able to develop to pupal stages or even into pharate adults as hemizygotes, suggesting they might represent hypomorphs. Overall, these eight alleles appear to represent an extensive allelic series. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Isolation and characterization of Black Spot mutants. (A) Exemplar of the Black Spot phenotype. [1A13]/Df(3L)ED220 larvae exhibit melanotic nodules of various sizes; a particularly large one is labeled with an arrowhead (“BS”). (B–D) Complementation tests identified a collection of Black Spot mutants, only some of which actually generate melanotic masses with high penetrance (examples labeled with arrowheads). Normal (wt) animals complete their third instar larval stage by day ∼5, and proceed to ∼5 d of pupal development. Pupae containing pharate animals are visible by day ∼10, and they eclose shortly thereafter as adult flies. Wt animals are shown as a reference to the left of B and C. In contrast, many hemizygous Black Spot alleles are substantially developmentally delayed and maintain their larval phase until days 12 (C) to 16 (D), with some living mutants detected at day 18 (not shown). All of the larvae collected in this summary were mobile and thus alive. Hypomorphic mutants could pupate and even advance to the pharate stage; however, it is likely that some of the pupae shown at the latest days are deceased. See Supplemental Figure 1 for additional notes regarding the larval extended phase, lethal phase, and black spot penetrance at different ages in the different hemizygous mutants. (E) Several of the Black Spot mutants attain larger larval size than normal; shown are [1A13] hemizygotes as an example. Other alleles such as [f10978] are growth deficient. All alleles tested could be rescued by kae1 genomic transgenes; shown is rescue of [f10978]/Df larva. Black Spot mutants affect the Drosophila ortholog of Kae1 To identify the gene mutated in Black Spot mutants, we used P-element mapping (Zhai et al. 2003) to narrow the region of interest within the deficiency (Supplemental Fig. 2). Coding exons from genes in the region were amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from hemizygous mutant larvae and sequenced. We identified one locus (CG4933), the fly ortholog of Kae1, that harbored nonconservative changes in all eight alleles (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, we identified two uncharacterized mutants in 72F-73A (l(3)72Fb[209] and l(3)72Fb[331], V Bedian, pers. comm. to FlyBase) that failed to complement Black Spot mutants. Sequencing showed that the l(3)72Fb alleles exhibit missense and nonsense mutations in CG4933, respectively. Notably, while l(3)72Fb[209] mutates a residue in the ATP-binding pocket, none of the other point mutations directly affect any functionally characterized regions (e.g., other residues that bind ATP or metal ion, or Kae1 faces that bind its partner KEOPS proteins Pcc1 or Bud32, Fig. 2A). Finally, we found that PBac{WH}CG4933[f01978], which carries a piggyBac insertion into the CG4933 5′ UTR (dos Santos et al. 2015), also failed to complement Black Spot mutants. These observations strongly support that CG4933 corresponds to Black Spot. Consistent with this, qRT-PCR analysis of several independent point mutants showed moderate decreases in CG4933 transcripts, and these were undetectable in f01978 hemizygotes (Fig. 2B,C). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Summary of Drosophila kae1 (CG4933) mutant alleles. (A) An alignment of fruit fly, human, yeast, and archaeal orthologs of Kae1. Functionally/structurally defined regions are highlighted, including the binding regions for Pcc1 and Bud32, and the ATP- and ion-binding regions. All Black Spot alleles recovered from our screen revealed that point mutations affected well-conserved residues. Notably, none of the mutations directly affects a known functional site, although a few mutations are in the vicinity of such regions. The noncomplementing allele l(3)72Fb[331], identified from a public stock collection, bears a nonsense mutation in kae1. Note that 1A2 and 1A19 induce the same coding change, even though these were isolated from different chromosomes in the screen. (B) qRT-PCR analysis of kae1 from various homozygous or hemizygous mutants. All of our point alleles maintain substantial levels of kae1 transcripts, although several of them are reduced by 20%–30%. The pBac insertion into the 5′ UTR of kae1, f[10978], appears to be a null allele as no transcript was detected. (C) Agarose gel analysis of qRT-PCR amplicons confirms the absence of kae1 transcripts in f[10978]/Df larvae.To confirm that Black Spot phenotypes were functionally due to loss of CG4933, we generated untagged and GFP-tagged genomic transgenes using the P[acman] backbone. Both CG4933 constructs rescued independent lethal hemizygotes (1A13 and f01978) to adult viability, and no melanotic masses were observed in rescued animals (e.g., Figs. 1E, 3 and other data not shown). In summary, we have isolated metazoan mutants of kae1, encoding a universal tRNA modification factor, representing the first extensive allelic series of a t6A pathway factor in any organism. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Analysis of t6A-modified tRNAs in yeast KEOPS and Drosophila kae1 mutants. (A) Analysis of yeast t6A pathway mutants is shown as a control. Primer extension assays yield a ladder of bands indicating the presence of stalled products. These include a band at position A37 of tRNA-Ile[AAU] of wild-type yeast that is strongly depleted in yeast t6A pathway mutants, thus indicating a t6A-modified nucleoside. tRNA-Val[UAC] is shown as a control for a non-t6A-bearing substrate. The ladder positions are inaccurate due to incomplete digestion; therefore, sizes are labeled according to the input primer. (B) Analysis of Drosophila kae1 mutants. Modifications of the A37 positions of tRNA-Met[CAU] and tRNA-Ile[AAU] are decreased although not eliminated in two strong hemizygous conditions of kae1. The reduction observed in kae1[1A13]/Df was rescued by a P[acman]-kae1 genomic transgene (“kae1+”). Note that mutant larvae were collected at an advanced age in their extended larval period to separate them from potential maternal contributions; the normal larval period ends at ∼5 d. (C) LC-MS/MS analysis of total tRNAs from Drosophila kae1 hemizygous mutant larvae. We observe a minor decrease in total t6A-modified tRNAs in the hypomorphic allele [7A9] and stronger decreases in the strong/null alleles [f01978] and [1A13]. The levels of t6A-modified tRNAs did not decrease further in exceptionally long-lived kae1 mutant larvae, and the loss of t6A was rescued by a kae1 genomic transgene.Decrease, but not elimination, of t6A-modified tRNAs in kae1 mutants Although Sua5/KEOPS genes are well-conserved across different domains of life, their involvement in t6A synthesis has not formally been demonstrated outside of unicellular models. We initially utilized primer extension assays to assess potential defects in the accumulation of t6A-modified tRNAs. As positive controls, we assayed RNAs isolated from wild-type yeast and sua5, kae1, and bud32 knockouts (Srinivasan et al. 2011). Extensions using an end-labeled primer specific for tRNA-Ile[AAU] showed that t6A pathway mutants were specifically depleted of a stalled product at the normally modified position A37, whereas primer extension patterns for control tRNA-Val[UAC] were not substantially altered (Fig. 3A). Similar assays of third instar larvae bearing various strong Drosophila kae1 alleles in trans to a deficiency also revealed alteration at A37 (Fig. 3B). However, the loss of modified tRNAs in the total population were notably modest compared to the yeast mutants, since yeast kae1 mutants retain only a few percent of total t6A (El Yacoubi et al. 2011; Srinivasan et al. 2011); see also Figure 4. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Genetic and molecular complementation of yeast t6A mutants with Drosophila orthologs. (A–C) Single complementation tests. The schematic depicts the transformations of cognate yeast genes and their fly orthologs, assayed for complementation of sua5 (A), kae1 (B), and bud32 (C) null mutants. Comparison of single colony sizes indicates substantial growth rescue by fly proteins, although not as robust as the yeast counterparts. (D,E) Double complementation tests. The schematics depict combinations of fly orthologs assayed for complementation of kae1 (D) and bud32 (E) null mutants. Improved growth rescue by supplying combinations of fly factors was noticeable, particularly for Drosophila kae1 + bud32. (F) Primer extension analysis demonstrating molecular rescue of t6A-modified tRNA-Ile by yeast and fly factors. (G) Mass spectrometry analysis of total yeast tRNAs. kae1 mutant yeast has borderline detectable levels of t6A-modified tRNAs, which are restored by complementation with yeast KAE1 and by Drosophila KEOPS genes. Consistent with the behavior in yeast growth (D) and in primer extension assays (F), the combination of Drosophila kae1 + bud32 conferred the best rescue of t6A-modified tRNAs.Inspection of modENCODE data (Brown et al. 2014) shows that Drosophila kae1 is ubiquitously expressed but present at highest levels in ovaries and the early blastoderm embryo, indicating its strong maternal deposition. Some maternal gene products can support organismal processes for days (Lecourtois and Schweisguth 1995; Lu et al. 2000), and tRNAs themselves are typically expected to be relatively stable (Hanoune and Agarwal 1970), although loss of some tRNA modifications is documented to render tRNAs unstable (Alexandrov et al. 2006). Because of these considerations, we sought to extend the analysis of kae1 zygotic mutants as late as possible. Bearing in mind that normal Drosophila complete their larval stages by ∼5 d, we collected RNA from 12-d and 18-d kae1 mutant larvae. However, we did not observe further decreases in the level of t6A-modified tRNAs even at these extended timepoints (Fig. 3). To provide a global assessment on the amount of t6A-modified tRNAs in kae1 mutants, we purified total tRNA, enzymatically hydrolyzed the tRNA to ribonucleosides, and analyzed these using liquid chromatography-coupled triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a dynamic MRM method (Su et al. 2014). This analysis showed a mild (∼10%) decrease of t6A-modified tRNAs in hemizygotes of the weak allele kae1[7A9], and more substantial decreases (∼40%) in hemizygotes of the strong/null alleles kae1[1A13] and kae1[f01978] (Fig. 3C). We also observed full restoration of t6A-modified tRNAs in LC-MS/MS analysis of P[acman]-CG4933/+; kae1[1A13]/Df larvae, consistent with the viability rescue conferred by the genomic transgene. Together, these observations provide evidence that kae1 is required for normal accumulation t6A-modified tRNAs in a metazoan setting. We cannot rule out that the remaining modified tRNAs are exceptionally stable. However, quantitative analysis did not reveal further decrease of t6A-modified tRNAs in kae1[f01978]/Df between 6- and 12-d larvae, suggesting that perdurance is not the major underlying cause of the remaining t6A. An alternate scenario is that they are contributed by the mitochondrial pool, which is presumably generated by the mitochondrial Kae1 paralog Qri7 (annotated as Drosophila CG14231). We note that Qri7 generates only a minute fraction of total t6A-modified tRNAs in yeast (Srinivasan et al. 2011), suggesting a potential difference between these eukaryotic species. Drosophila Sua5/KEOPS genes complement corresponding yeast null mutants Because the fly null mutants did not fully eliminate t6A, we sought supporting evidence on the role of Drosophila Kae1 in this pathway. Therefore, we conducted genetic replacement assays in a simpler heterologous host system, namely, in S. cerevisiae mutants in t6A pathway genes. As described, these are slow-growing but can be maintained in the null condition and are nearly completely deficient for t6A (El Yacoubi et al. 2011; Srinivasan et al. 2011). To judge the overall relationship of the fly orthologs to their yeast counterparts, we tested for direct complementation of several yeast t6A mutants (Fig. 3A) by their Drosophila orthologs. We cloned the open reading frames for Drosophila kae1, bud32, and sua5 into the yeast expression plasmid, pADH416. Because yeast mutants in these three genes grow very poorly (Srinivasan et al. 2011), we transformed the Drosophila expression constructs into the corresponding yeast heterozygous diploid mutants. As controls, the same diploids were transformed with plasmids expressing the yeast protein, and with an empty vector. The transformed diploids were sporulated and then dissected to yield haploid segregants. Haploids containing plasmids expressing the Drosophila or yeast protein, or the empty vector, were identified and then streaked to individual colonies on selective medium. The results of growth after ∼66 h at 30°C are shown in Figure 4A–C. Colony size is a sensitive measure of growth rate for yeast. Drosophila sua5, whose product generates the substrate for the KEOPS complex, yielded growth rescue that was comparable to its yeast ortholog (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the two KEOPS components Drosophila kae1 and bud32 both conferred substantial rescue, as compared with vector control transformants, but growth was not as robust as with the cognate yeast factors (Fig. 4B,C). The relative degree of complementation was also apparent on the dissection plates on which the haploid spores germinated. Representative tetrads are shown in Supplemental Figure 3 for the kae1 and bud32 heterozygotes. In both cases, colonies identified as containing the Drosophila gene were larger than colonies containing vector or no plasmid, but not as large as wild-type colonies. As the rescues by individual fly KEOPS proteins were less robust than with the cognate yeast factors, we tested if their function could be improved by supplying multiple Drosophila factors. This proved to be the case. Figure 4D shows a kae1 mutant expressing Drosophila Kae1 + Pcc1 (sector 1), Drosophila Kae1 + Bud32 (sector 2), or Drosophila Kae1 alone (sector 3). Coexpression with either Kae1 partner improved growth rescue. Similarly, coexpression of Drosophila Bud32 and Kae1 yielded enhanced rescue of yeast bud32 (Fig. 4E, sector 2), relative to Drosophila Bud32 alone (sector 3). Notably, expressing Drosophila Bud32 and Pcc1 together did not improve complementation of yeast bud32 relative to Bud32 alone (Fig. 4E, cf. sectors 1 and 3). This is consistent with the fact that Bud32 and Pcc1 do not interact directly in the complex, whereas both of them physically contact different faces of Kae1 in the KEOPS complex (Hecker et al. 2008; Mao et al. 2008). The growth improvements in these double complementation tests were also visible on tetrad dissection plates (Supplemental Fig. 3).Rescue of t6A-modified tRNAs in yeast kae1 mutants by Drosophila KEOPS factors We performed biochemical analysis of tRNA modification in mutant and rescued yeast. Primer extensions using a probe against tRNA-Ile[AAU] recapitulated strong loss in the A37 band in kae1 mutant yeast transformed with an empty vector, which was fully restored by the S. cerevisiae KAE1 expression construct (Fig. 4F). Comparison with yeast transformed with various combinations of Drosophila KEOPS factors showed strong agreement between growth properties and accumulation of t6A. That is, we observed moderate rescue by fly kae1 alone, but much stronger improvement by including other members of the Drosophila KEOPS complex (Fig. 4F). We extended the above analysis of individual tRNAs to the total tRNA population using LC-MS/MS. These assays were strongly correlated with the relative degree of rescue observed in primer extension analysis. In particular, this quantitative method allowed us to distinguish greater restoration of t6A by Drosophila kae1 + bud32, relative to kae1 + pcc1 (Fig. 4G). In particular, the rescue by Drosophila kae1 + bud32 was equivalent to the cognate rescue by yeast kae1. Finally, we note that LC-MS/MS analysis of yeast samples also detected cyclic t6A (ct6A). It has been reported that ct6A is formed by cyclization of t6A and was observed in diverse domains of life including yeast, but not in any vertebrates tested (Miyauchi et al. 2013). Consistent with this, we did not detect ct6A above background in the analysis of fly tRNAs (data not shown). In the yeast profilings, trends in ct6A levels closely mirrored those of t6A (Fig. 4G). ct6A levels were below the limit of detection in kae1 mutants, and rescued to similar relative levels as with t6A by the KEOPS expression constructs. However, ct6A peak areas were approximately fivefold smaller than corresponding levels of t6A. Despite efforts to minimize hydrolysis by conducting the analysis at neutral pH, it is possible that a portion of ct6A was hydrolyzed to t6A during sample preparation. In any case, these results clearly demonstrate the biochemical activity of Drosophila KEOPS genes including Kae1 in the biogenesis of N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine-modified tRNAs. Since we did not detect ct6A in Drosophila samples, we will continue to generally refer to t6A in the remainder of this study. kae1 mutants exhibit aberrant hematopoietic development and activity Having established the role of Drosophila Kae1 and its partners in t6A biosynthesis, we sought to examine the nature of developmental defects caused by absence of this tRNA modification pathway. We began with the analysis of the namesake “Black Spots,” which resemble phenotypes associated with derangement in the development and/or deployment of the hematopoietic system (Minakhina and Steward 2006). Therefore, we investigated the status of the lymph gland as well as circulating blood cells in the hemolymph. We first examined kae1[1A13]/Df(3L)ED220 larvae, which exhibit a strong molecular defect in t6A biogenesis (Fig. 3C) and generate “black spots” with nearly complete penetrance (Fig. 1A). The hemolymph of control TM6B sibling third instar larvae exhibit normal distributions of blood cells (Fig. 5A), primarily plasmatocytes (identifiable as ∼10 µM diameter cells) and more rare lamellocytes (40–50 µM diameter cells). In contrast, hemolymph smears of ∼10-d-old kae1[1A13] hemizygous larvae showed increased density of blood cells, and in particular, massive overrepresentation of lamellocytes (Fig. 5B). We also identified large circulating aggregates that resembled lymph gland fragments (Fig. 5C), as well as apparent phalloidin-rich tumors that were packed with lamellocytes (Fig. 5D). The latter could be melanized and were identifiable as “black spots,” but they were not necessarily pigmented, suggesting they had not yet initiated the melanogenesis cascade. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Hematopoietic overgrowth and blood cell defects in kae1 mutants. All samples were stained with Hoechst (blue) to label DNA and rhodamine phalloidin (red) to label F-actin; all scale bars, 50 µm. Control animals were TM6B siblings of crosses used to generate kae1/Df(3L)ED220 larvae and are thus heterozygous for kae1. (A) Control hemolymph shows the typical profile in which most circulating hemocytes are plasmatocytes ([P] asterisks). (B) kae1[1A13] hemizygous hemolymph shows increased density of blood cells, as well as numerous lamellocytes, often present in clusters ([L] arrowheads). Lamellocytes (∼40–50 µm in diameter) are larger than plasmatocytes (10 µm in diameter). (C) Large aggregates bearing organized structure were observed in circulation as were overt tumors that are packed with plasmatocytes and lamellocytes (D). The latter correspond to the melanotic masses observed in live “black spot” larvae. (E–H) Anterior lobe of lymph gland from third instar in control (E) and from aged kae1/Df(3L)ED220 larvae (F–H); the dorsal vessel (DV) is labeled. The kae1 mutants exhibit strong overcommitment to lamellocyte fate in the lymph gland (F) and typically have overgrown lobes (G). Frequently, the anterior lobe was observed in the process of dispersal or was detached entirely from the dorsal vessel (H). (I–L) Analysis of anterior lymph gland lobes in second instar larvae. Compared with control (I), all kae1 mutants exhibit ectopic lamellocytes (J–L). The hypomorphs [1A2] (J) and [1A13] (K) are relatively normally sized, but the null [f01978] (L) is strongly overgrown. (M,N) Analysis of mitotic cells (labeled with anti-phospho-Histone H3, green) in posterior lobes of lymph glands from control (M) and [1A13]/Df (N). The kae1 mutant has overgrown posterior lobes that harbor more actively dividing cells.Notably, lamellocyte overproduction is a frequent feature of other characterized mutants bearing melanotic masses (Lemaitre et al. 1995; Minakhina and Steward 2006). Therefore, we analyzed the status of the Drosophila hematopoietic tissue, the lymph gland. The compact disposition of the anterior lobe in normal third instar lymph gland is shown in Figure 5E and shows few lamellocytes. In contrast, ∼10-d-old kae1[1A13] hemizygous larval lymph glands show abundant maturation of lamellocytes and are typically enlarged (Fig. 5F,G). Often, we find that the anterior lobe was in the process of dispersing, or completely detached from the dorsal vessel (Fig. 5H). This correlates with the observation of apparent lymph tissue in the circulatory system (Fig. 5C). We observed similar phenotypes with the hypomorphic combination kae1[1A2]/Df(3L)ED220, except that its hematopoietic alterations were weaker and/or slower to develop (Supplemental Fig. 4). That is, defects were less robust at day 8 relative to day 10 larvae. As mentioned, most kae1 mutants exhibit a vastly extended larval stage. Thus, we considered it plausible that the enlarged lymph tissues developed progressively over this aberrant larval period. To ask whether kae1 mutants exhibit defects during the normal course of larval development, we examined [1A2] (weak), [1A13] (strong), and [f10978] (null) kae1 hemizygotes at the second instar. We observed overrepresentation of lamellocytes in anterior lymph gland lobes in all genotypes, although [1A2] was not overgrown and [1A13] was only slightly enlarged relative to control (Fig. 5I–K). However, [f10978] exhibited both considerable overgrowth and ectopic commitment to lamellocyte fates (Fig. 5L). This is despite the fact that [f10978] develops modest frequencies of black spot compared with [1A13] (Fig. 1), indicating that hematopoietic tumors can exist without melanization of nodules. We also note that [f10978] exhibit lymph gland overgrowth despite the comparably small size of these larvae (Fig. 1), indicating partial uncoupling of organism size and individual organ size. To verify their status as “tumors,” we stained second instar lymph glands for phospho-Histone H3 (pH3), a marker of mitotic cells. Figure 5M,N shows that kae1[1A13]/Df mutants also show expansion of their posterior lobes, although not as robust as with the anterior lobe. Nevertheless, these tissues show clear increases in the frequency of anti-pH3-labeled cells, indicating that the expanded hematopoietic tissues are accounted for by increased cell division, as well as alteration in cell fate toward lamellocytes.Essential requirement for kae1 in imaginal discs but not throughout the larval CNS A conspicuous aspect of the strong kae1 alleles were their nearly complete absence of imaginal discs. These begin as small cell populations that are set aside in the embryo, and proliferate during larval stages to increase their numbers ∼1000-fold (Milán et al. 1996), generating the tissues that will form the adult structures during metamorphosis. We mounted larval brain-imaginal disc complexes from wild-type and two strong kae1 mutants for comparison (Fig. 6A–C). Discs were completely absent in most larvae, or at best yielded tiny tissue rudiments that might potentially be discs, but cannot confidently be assigned to any particular disc identity. In contrast, the CNS was slightly smaller but remained present. Closer inspection revealed that the optic lobes were strongly reduced in size in kae1 mutants, whereas the ventral nerve cord (VNC) was less affected (Fig. 6A–C). Notably, the optic lobes are the main proliferating centers in the larval CNS, whereas the VNC is primarily composed of post-mitotic neurons. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Essential requirement for kae1 in imaginal disc cells. (A–C) Preparations of third instar brain-disc complexes, stained for DAPI (gray), phalloidin (red) and the post-mitotic neuronal marker Elav (blue). Scale bars, 200 μm. (A) Wt complexes show the CNS (in outline) and an array of discs that generate the adult body structures. Because not all the discs remain attached to each other during dissection, a composite image that captures all of the discs is shown. These include pairs of wing (W), haltere (H), and eye-antennal (EA) discs, and six leg (L) discs. In kae1[1A13] (B) and kae1[f01978] (C) hemizygotes, essentially no imaginal discs are found, even though the CNS can be readily identified. The CNS can be divided into the optic lobes (OL, dotted lines) and the ventral nerve cord (VNC). The CNS is mildly smaller in kae1[1A13]/Df larvae (B) and substantially reduced in kae1[f01978]/Df larvae (C); however, note that the OL is preferentially reduced. The VNC harbors a stronger proportion of post-mitotic neurons than the OLs, as evidenced by Elav staining. (D,E) Analysis of mitotic clones generated in wing imaginal discs of control lacZ FRT80 (D) and kae1 FRT80 (E) chromosomes; enlargements are shown in D′ and E′. The clones are generated in a heterozygous (+/−) ub-GFP FRT80 background, which produces an intermediate level of GFP. Homozygous mutant clones (−/−) lack GFP whereas their sibling twin-spot clones (+/+) express elevated levels of GFP. Seventy-two hours after clone induction, all three cell populations are identified in the control experiment (D), whereas homozygous kae1 mutant cells were not recovered in wing discs (E). (F) Quantification of relative sizes of clones and their sibling twin-spots. n = 26 lacZ clones and 20 kae1 clones analyzed. Scale bars, 200 μm, except D′, E′, 50 μm.We further examined the role of kae1 in proliferating tissues by generating negatively marked somatic clones in wing imaginal discs. In this system, both daughters of a mitotic recombination event are marked and remain distinguished as clones. The homozygous mutant clone is detected by loss of a marker (e.g., ubi-GFP) whereas its homozygous wild-type “twinspot” clone expresses the marker more intensely than the surrounding heterozygous tissue. Control FRT80 clones exhibit similar relative sizes to their twinspots (Fig. 6D,D′). In contrast, FRT80 kae1[1A13] clones were never recovered in imaginal discs, even though their twinspots were sizable (Fig. 6E,E′). We quantified the differences in clone/twinspot sizes in Figure 6F. These data imply substantial growth and/or competitive disadvantage of cells lacking the t6A modification pathway, which must have been removed from development after only a few cell divisions at most. We note that somatic clones of kae1 should still have inherited at least some Kae1 protein, mRNA, and/or t6A-modified tRNAs, yet failed to survive. From this, we infer that perdurance is not a major cause for the ability of kae1 null zygotic mutants to survive for over two and a half weeks (Fig. 1).Differential requirements of kae1 in mitotic and nonproliferating larval tissues The clonal analyses caused us to evaluate more carefully the extent to which different tissues were affected in kae1 mutants. It is clear that kae1-deficient cells exhibit growth defects in some contexts. Nevertheless, our original isolation of kae1 mutants as extremely long-lived larvae exhibiting hematopoietic expansion (Fig. 1) indicates that many cells and tissues can not only survive, but seemingly thrive in the kae1 null state for weeks. For example, differentiated post-mitotic blood cells such as lamellocytes (Krzemien et al. 2010) are both overrepresented and actively functional in encapsulation during the extended larval phase of kae1 mutants (Fig. 5D; Supplemental Fig. 4). We surveyed other tissues that were maintained in kae1 mutant larvae, including the gut (Supplemental Fig. 5), salivary glands (Fig. 7A–F), fat body, and somatic musculature (Fig. 7G–I). For the most part, all of these tissues are dominantly or solely composed of nonproliferating cells during the larval stages. Therefore, these observations solidify the notion that mitotic cells are preferentially affected by loss of kae1. However, this does not mean that defects were lacking in these other larval tissues. Interestingly, quantitative analysis showed tissue-specific and allele-specific differences between their behavior. For example, even though kae1[1A13]/Df mutants maintain only marginally more t6A than kae1[f10978]/Df mutants (Fig. 3C), we observed progressively smaller salivary glands in kae1 mutants with less t6A (Fig. 7J). More strikingly, the size of salivary gland cells was mostly unaffected in [1A13] hemizygotes, whereas they were tiny by comparison in [f10978] hemizygotes (Fig. 7K). Thus, the slight amount of t6A in a strongly hypomorphic kae1 condition can maintain salivary gland cell size, even though these glands evidently have fewer cells than normal, whereas the null condition compromises both cell and organ size in the salivary gland. In contrast, the absolute size of the body wall musculature is largely unaffected in kae1[1A13]/Df, and only slightly reduced in the kae1[f10978]/Df mutants (Fig. 7L,M). Indeed, the small size of kae1 null larvae (Fig. 1E) may be sufficient to explain the small size of its muscles, which are expected to scale to body size. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Differential requirements of kae1 in mitotic vs. nonproliferating tissues. Larval tissues were analyzed from kae1[1A13] and kae1[f01978] hemizygotes, which fully lack imaginal discs (Fig. 6). (A–I) Immunostaining of dissected tissues, using DAPI (blue) and phalloidin (red). (A–F) Salivary glands (and some attached fat bodies) imaged at 10× to visualize entire glands (A–C) and at 20× to emphasize individual cell sizes (D–F). (G–I) Body wall musculature. Selected muscles VL1-4 and LO1 are labeled. The length of a body segment is denoted with the double arrow lines. (J) Quantifications of salivary gland sizes (n = 10 all genotypes) and (K) salivary gland cell sizes (n = 15 cells from the distal tip measured in each of eight glands, all genotypes). Although kae1[1A13]/Df larvae exhibit severe defects in mitotic tissues, the overall salivary gland size and cell size are more modestly affected. The null allele kae1[f01978] is severely compromised in both aspects of the salivary gland. (L) Quantifications of VL1 muscle length and (M) VL2 muscle length. kae1[1A13]/Df larvae exhibit normal muscle sizes, while the null allele is only ∼40% reduced. Error bar shows standard error; all statistical analyses were unpaired Student's t-tests. (N–P) Adult eyes bearing Gal4 driver alone (N) or expressing kae1-RNAi under control of ey-Gal4 (O) or GMR-Gal4 (P). The former is active in the proliferating eye primordium, whereas the latter is active in post-mitotic photoreceptor neurons. (Q,R) Third instar eye-antennal imaginal discs stained for DAPI, Cut (green, to label cone cells) and Elav (red, to label photoreceptors). Compared to the control disc (Q), depletion of kae1 using ey-Gal4 induces severely defective eye development. All scale bars, 200 μm.Distinct effects of depleting kae1 in mitotic and post-mitotic contexts of an individual tissue Our extensive phenotypic analyses reveal strikingly distinct requirements for Kae1 in mitotic and nonproliferating larval tissues. To test for potentially distinct requirements for kae1 in mitotic and post-mitotic contexts within the same tissue, we turned to an RNAi approach. The developing eye is convenient for this purpose, as characterized drivers can be used to express transgenes in the undifferentiated, mitotic portion of the eye primordium (ey-Gal4) or in the post-mitotic photoreceptors (GMR-Gal4). Analysis of ey-Gal4 > UAS-kae1-RNAi flies showed strongly malformed eyes, which were small and rough (Fig. 7N,O). We obtained similar results with independent RNAi transgenes (data not shown). In contrast, GMR-Gal4 > UAS-kae1-RNAi produced eyes that developed normally, with all transgenes tested (Fig. 7P). Cellular analysis demonstrated that depletion of kae1 using ey-Gal4 caused developmental defects. Compared to the normal size and differentiation status of normal third instar eye discs, stained for the photoreceptor marker Elav and cone cell marker Cut, ey-Gal4 > UAS-kae1-RNAi discs exhibit rudimentary eye discs with disturbed patterning (Fig. 7Q,R). On the other hand, knockdown with GMR-Gal4 did not affect larval eye development (data not shown). Therefore, kae1 is critically required in mitotic, but not in post-mitotic, eye cells.DISCUSSION Confirmation of the t6A modification pathway in a metazoan To date, nearly all studies of the t6A biogenesis pathway have been conducted in unicellular organisms such as bacteria or yeast. The first functional study of a metazoan t6A component involved knockdown of the mitochondrial Kae1 paralog Qri7 (OSGEP-L) in Caenorhabditis elegans, which induced defective mitochondrial morphology and function (Oberto et al. 2009). Subsequently, a knockdown study of the D. melanogaster Bud32/PRPK reported growth defects relating to defective TOR signaling (Ibar et al. 2013). However, neither study assessed biochemical defects in t6A accumulation per se. Furthermore, knockdown approaches do not generally achieve genetic null states. We demonstrate loss of t6A-modified tRNAs in Drosophila kae1 mutants, using both primer extension of individual species and mass spectrometry to examine the bulk population. Moreover, we demonstrate substantial cross-species rescue by fly Kae1 (and its partners) in yeast kae1 mutants, both in terms of growth capacity and in recovery of t6A-modified tRNAs. While this work was in preparation, similar observations using the kae1 transposon insertion alleles were reported by the Glavic group (Rojas-Benitez et al. 2015). Our findings corroborate and extend their results. Nevertheless, our detection of substantial t6A-modified tRNAs in Drosophila kae1 mutants was unexpected. Previous characterization of yeast kae1 mutants (El Yacoubi et al. 2011; Srinivasan et al. 2011), which we confirm here, showed nearly complete absence of t6A-modified tRNAs. This raises two general possibilities. First, it may be that t6A-modified tRNAs are exceptionally stable in Drosophila. In this scenario, even though we assayed timepoints going well past the established range of maternal effects (e.g., up to 18 d, or the equivalent of a week-old adult fly), those modified tRNAs that were maternally deposited or generated from maternal kae1 mRNA and/or protein persisted all that time. Alternatively, many species, including yeast and Drosophila, express a mitochondrial Kae1 paralog named Qri7. Although mitochondrially derived t6A appears to comprise a minute portion of the total pool in single-celled organisms, the situation might be different in a metazoan. For example, the substantial populations of nonproliferating tissues that tolerate deletion of kae1 include the larval musculature, which sustain larval locomotion in mutants for weeks. Therefore, the remaining t6A-modified tRNAs in kae1 null mutant larvae may potentially be contributed by the abundant mitochondria in muscles. In the future, characterization of a Drosophila Qri7 (CG14231) knockout would provide a useful comparison, especially to see if Qri7 loss preferentially affects tissues with exceptional needs for oxidative phosphorylation.An extensive allelic series of kae1 mutants reveal diverse biology of t6A The first allele in a t6A biogenesis component, yeast sua5-1, was isolated in a forward genetic screen as an extragenic suppressor of a mutant cyc1 allele bearing an aberrant uORF (Hampsey et al. 1991). UV and X-rays were used as mutagens in these screens, and cloning of sua5-1 revealed a single-base substitution resulting in an S107F missense alteration (Na et al. 1992). Subsequently, other genetic efforts hit various KEOPS components of the t6A pathway, but these studies utilized screening of a deletion collection (Downey et al. 2006) or a multicopy suppressor scheme (Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006). All of these studies pre-dated the connection of Sua5/KEOPS factors to t6A biogenesis, and for the most part, studies have focused on generation of straight or conditional knockout alleles (Arigoni et al. 1998; El Yacoubi et al. 2009, 2011; Handford et al. 2009; Srinivasan et al. 2011). We describe the first extensive set of point mutations in a t6A pathway component. These mutations sort along a comprehensive allelic series that includes null alleles, strong mutants, and weak hypomorphs. We document allele-specific phenotypic severities in different tissues, and also note that biochemically strong hypomorphs exhibit modest phenotypes in some settings (e.g., exhibit normal somatic musculature) but phenocopy null alleles in other settings (e.g., completely lack imaginal discs). These discrepancies highlight the utility of the allelic series in dissecting multiple requirements of essential housekeeping genes in regulating fundamental cellular processes in vivo. Future studies can continue to exploit these alleles to elucidate the biology of t6A modification. For example, it remains unclear what underlying causes provoke the dramatic hematopoietic responses in kae1 mutants, and our alleles provide unique means for querying this. Of note, substantial hematopoietic overgrowth is observed in both strong hypomorphs and the null condition, but only the former proceeds reliably toward generation of melanotic nodules. The kae1 alleles we report should also be valuable for understanding the mechanism of t6A modification. Extensive structural studies delineate the Kae1 active site and binding surfaces with its partners Pcc1 and Bud32 (Hecker et al. 2008; Mao et al. 2008; Wan et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2015). Interestingly, only one of our many point mutations directly affects any of these functionally characterized regions (Fig. 2A). This highlights the usage of a forward genetic screen to identify relevant mutations. This mutant collection can be utilized as a basis of structure-function studies to assess how these uncharacterized residues might affect formation of the KEOPS complex, productive t6A transfer, or potentially the specificity of substrate tRNA recognition.Differential requirements of t6A in proliferating and nonproliferating cells Studies of the biology of t6A modification pathway in metazoan systems are only in their infancy. The Glavic group reported foundational studies using transgenic RNAi against Drosophila Prpk/Bud32 (Ibar et al. 2013), and their recent work (Rojas-Benitez et al. 2015) and our current study extend this to genuine kae1 mutants. There are general similarities between the phenotypes of fruit fly and unicellular organism mutants, in that these genes are lethal (as in bacteria) and exhibit substantially defective growth (as in yeast). Of course, one of the major opportunities specifically available in higher eukaryotes is to examine potential cell- and tissue-specific requirements. Here, we find evidence for differential requirements for kae1 in distinct cell types. Quite noticeably, strong kae1 mutants completely lack imaginal discs. The progenitor populations of discs are set aside during embryonic development, and they proliferate extensively during larval stages to generate the tissues that will form the adult body plan during metamorphosis. Although we cannot precisely assess the timing of effective depletion of maternal stores of t6A-modifed tRNAs (i.e., that are directly deposited into the oocyte, or that are generated via maternally deposited kae1 mRNA and/or protein), our clonal studies demonstrate a timely impact on removal of the kae1 genomic locus. That is, even though there exists substantial likelihood of Kae1 and t6A-modified tRNAs inherited from the mother cell prior to mitotic recombination, kae1 mutant disc cells are quickly disadvantaged and rapidly removed during the course of normal development. Overall, we note these kae1 phenotypes are strikingly similar to certain other Drosophila mutants. For example, we and others previously characterized mutants of the central E1 and E2 enzymes in the SUMO pathway (the heterodimeric pair Aos1/Uba2 and Ubc9, respectively), and these develop a range of defects that are strikingly similar to what we documented for kae1 mutants. Phenotypes common to loss of Kae1 and SUMO include extended larval phases before lethality, presence of melanotic tumors, and preferential defects in mitotic versus nonproliferating cells, as evidenced by their lack of imaginal discs while retaining diverse other larval tissues (Kalamarz et al. 2012; Kanakousaki and Gibson 2012). Similarly, a number of zygotic cell cycle mutants specifically abrogate development of imaginal discs while generally sparing other endoreplicated and post-mitotic larval tissues (Gatti and Baker 1989). Altogether, these analyses highlight how mutations in seemingly “general” cellular regulators can reveal tissue-specific requirements. Moreover, they suggest that several fundamental regulatory pathways are preferentially required in highly mitotic tissues. Whether this simply indicates that diverse processes mutate to a common terminal zygotic phenotype, reflecting the distinct biology of mitotic and nonproliferating cells, or whether there are actually mechanistic links between t6A, SUMO, and the cell cycle, remains to be dissected in the future.MATERIALS AND METHODS Genetic screen for kae1 alleles The region uncovered by Df(3L)ED220 was subjected to a lethal F2 screen after EMS mutagenesis. In total, we conducted nine rounds of mutagenesis using isogenized w[1118] males (rounds 1 and 2) or w ; FRT80B males (subsequent rounds). The animals were desiccated and fed 25mM EMS in 20% sucrose, then mated with w; TM3 Sb/TM6B females. Individual F1 TM6B males were crossed to w; Df(3L)ED220 w+/TM6B females (Bloomington #8077). Vials were scored for lethality by the absence of empty non-Tb pupal cases. Owing to the w+ marker integral to Df(3L)ED220, stocks of new lethal alleles were recovered by collecting white-eyed flies carrying TM6B, and re-balancing. In total, we conducted nine rounds of mutagenesis, and scored >7000 viable crosses to the deficiency, yielding 64 lethals. The kae1 alleles [1A2], [1A13], and [1A19] were recovered in the w[1118] background, while [3A7], [5C3], [7A6], [7A9], and [9D1], FRT80B/TM6B were recovered in the w[1118]; FRT80B background. We subsequently identified other alleles of kae1 in stocks obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center, namely pBac-CG4933[f01978]/TM6B (#18497), l(3)72Fb[209]/TM6B (#4793), and l(3)72Fb[331]/TM6B (#4794).Construction of CG4933 rescue transgenes We amplified the genomic region encompassing CG4933 and part of the upstream flanking gene using the primers below. The fragment was cloned into pGEM-T-easy and sequence verified. The fragment was then excised with NotI and cloned into NotI digested attB-P[acman] (Venken et al. 2006), which had been treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. 4925AR TAAGCAATTATTTGATAGTCAATCTTTCG CG4933R AAGGAACAGGCCCTTTAAGTGGG We generated GFP-tagged CG4933 genomic transgene using recombineering, utilizing a two-step positive/negative selection (Warming et al. 2005). We performed positive/negative galK selection mediated by growth on MacConkey agar (positive selection for integration of the galK cassette) and growth on media containing 2-deoxygalactose (negative selection for replacement of galK cassette with GFP[S65T] CDS). Sequences (galK cassette and GFP[S65T] CDS) were amplified with primers described below from pgalK and pBD1010 (Barry Dickson), respectively. Purified PCR products were electroporated into SW102 bacteria (Warming et al. 2005) with the appropriate attB p[acman] CG4933 vector and selection was carried out as described previously (Venken et al. 2006).

To obtain larval blood cells and tumors, animals were bled gently, and hemolymph contents, including tumors, were recovered directly on slides. Larval samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, stained with Rhodamine Phalloidin (Invitrogen) and Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes), and imaged with Zeiss laser Scanning 510 confocal microscope. Images were recorded at 8 bit. AxioVision LE 4.5 or Zeiss LSM5 AxioVision software was used to process images.Analysis of other larval tissues Imaginal discs, brains, and muscles were dissected and stained following previously described protocol (Lai and Rubin 2001). Antibodies used were mouse anti-Cut (DSHB, 1:50), rat anti-Elav (DSHB, 1:500), Alexa Fluor-568 phalloidin (Life Technologies, 1:1000). Appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488, 568, and 647 were then used. Tissues were mounted in VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI.Clonal analysis We analyzed hsFlp; [w+, arm-lacZ] FRT80B/[w+, ubi-GFP] FRT80B and hsFlp; kae1[1A13] FRT80B/[w+, ubi-GFP] FRT80B animals. Larvae were heat-shocked at 37°C for 40 min at 72 h after egg laying, and were dissected 3 d after heat shock.RT-PCR Total RNA from homozygous or hemizygous larvae were extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen), followed by DNase treatment using TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion). cDNA were synthesized using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System with random primers (Invitrogen). QPCR reaction was performed with CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Primers used were Kae1_RT_F, TTTGGGTATTGAAGGCAGTG, and Kae1_RT_R, CAGGAAACCTTCTCCTGGTG, and RPL32_RT_F, CCGCTTCAAGGGACAGTATC, and RPL32_RT_R, ACGTTGTGCACCAGGAACTT.tRNA primer extension assays Two micrograms of tRNA extracted with mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion) was mixed with 1 pmol of [γ-32P]-labeled primer in 5 μL 1× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), heated to 95°C and then slowly cooled down to 37°C. Annealed RNA/primer was collected by brief centrifugation, added with 5 μL retro-transcription reaction mix, including 0.5 mM dNTPs, 0.01 M DTT, 200 units SuperScript III (Invitrogen) in 1× First-strand buffer and incubated at 50°C for 50 min, followed by heat inactivation at 70°C for 15 min. Reaction samples were then electrophoresed with 15% polyacrylamide–urea sequencing gels (40 cm long). S.c. Ile primer: gggatcgaaccgctgatc S.c. Met primer: aggttcgaactctcgacc S.c.

The following derivatives of W303 were used: EJP51 KAE1/kae1::kanMX6, RS2586 BUD32/bud32::kanMX6, and YYF1 SUA5/sua5::kanMX6. PCR was used to amplify the Drosophila cDNAs for KAE1, BUD32, PCC1, and SUA5 open reading frames. The cDNAs were cloned into a yeast expression plasmid vector, pADH416 or pADH415, with selectable markers URA3 or LEU2, respectively. These plasmids express the Drosophila proteins from the ADH promoter on a single copy plasmid. As controls, the corresponding yeast genes were expressed under their own promoters in the single copy vector pRS316. The plasmid expressing yeast Kae1 was described previously (Srinivasan et al. 2011) and yeast Pcc1, Bud32, and Sua5 expressing plasmids are pXZ1, pXZ2, and pXZ3, respectively.Mass spectrometric analysis of tRNA modifications Chemicals All chemicals and reagents used were obtained at the highest purity available and were used without further purification unless stated. Benzonase, bacterial alkaline phosphatase, butylated hydroxytoluene, acetonitrile, and buffer salts were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Coformycin was obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Phosphodiesterase I was purchased from Worthington. Tetrahydrouridine was purchased from Calbiochem. Water purified through a Milli-Q system (Millipore) was used throughout our studies. Sartorius Vivaspin 500-brand centrifugal filter units were used for dialysis and sample concentration.Extraction and purification of Drosophila and yeast RNA Total RNAs were isolated using TRIzol and then subjected to a two-step purification to obtain tRNA. First, a PureLink RNA Mini extraction kit (Life Technologies) was used to precipitate the ribosomal RNA in the sample. In the second step, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC) was performed using an Agilent Bio SEC-3 column with 10 mM ammonium acetate at pH 7 as the mobile phase. Neutral pH was selected to minimize hydrolysis of ct6A. tRNA and rRNA were collected as separate fractions, vacuum concentrated and reconstituted in water. tRNA concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy at 260 nm. In the yeast samples, the proportion of tRNA to ribosomal RNA was much higher so only SEC-HPLC fractionation was required to obtain pure tRNA for analysis.Nucleoside preparation Four micrograms of purified tRNA from each sample was digested using a mixture of Benzonase (21.5 U), bacterial alkaline phosphatase (0.5 U) and phosphodiesterase I (0.21 U) in a final reaction volume of 100 µL. Enzymes were dialyzed into 10 mM ammonium acetate at pH 7 immediately prior to use by washing twice with 10 kDa MWCO Vivaspin 500 spin filters. The reaction mixture was supplemented with MgCl2, CaCl2, and ZnCl2, each at a concentration of 0.1 mM. Nucleobase deaminase inhibitors coformycin and tetrahydrouridine were added at a concentration of 10 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL, respectively, and butylated hydroxytoluene (an antioxidant) was added at a concentration of 0.5 mM. The digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37°C and was stopped upon removal of the enzymes by microfiltration with 10 kDa spin filters.LC-MS/MS analysis of RNA nucleosides Ribonucleosides were separated using a Synergy Fusion RP, 2.5 µm particle size, 100 Å pore size, 100 mm length, 2 mm inner diameter from Phenomenex, on an Agilent 1290 series HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector. Mobile phase A was 5 mM ammonium acetate and mobile phase B was pure acetonitrile. Gradient elution started with 100% A for 1 min, increased to 10% B after 10 min, 40% after 14 min, 80% after 20 min and regeneration of starting conditions with 100% A for 5 additional minutes. The flow rate was 0.35 mL/min and the column temperature 35°C. The effluent from the column was directed through the DAD before entering the Agilent 6430 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The MS was operated in positive ion mode with the following parameters: electro-spray ionization (ESI-MS), fragmentor voltage (average) 80 V, cell accelerator voltage 2 V, N2-gas temperature 350°C, N2-gas flow 10 L/min, nebulizer 40 psi, capillary 3500 V. Modified nucleosides were identified based on having both the correct retention time and mass transition. Under our chromatography conditions, t6A eluted at 8.6 min while ct6A eluted at 6.8 min. Mass transitions were m/z 413 → 281 for t6A and m/z 395 → 263 for ct6A, both corresponding to the neutral loss of ribose. 15N-2-Deoxyadenosine was added to each sample as an internal standard.Data analysis In each sample, the UV peak areas at 260 nm of the four canonical ribonucleosides—cytidine, uridine, guanosine, and adenosine—were integrated and summed together. Peaks corresponding to detection of MRM transitions for the modified nucleosides were first normalized to the peak area of the internal standard (15N-2-deoxyadenosine) to account for inter-sample detection fluctuations, followed by a second normalization to the summed peak areas of the canonical nucleosides to account for the amount of injected RNA.

Drosophila melanogaster is a natural host of parasitic wasps of the genus Leptopilina. Attack by L. boulardi (Lb), a specialist wasp to flies of the melanogaster group, activates NF-κB-mediated humoral and cellular immunity. Inflammatory blood cells mobilize and encapsulate Lb eggs and embryos [2–5]. L. heterotoma (Lh), a generalist wasp, kills larval blood cells and actively suppresses immune responses. Spiked virus-like particles (VLPs) in wasp venom have clearly been linked to its successful parasitism of Drosophila [6], but VLP composition and their biotic nature have remained mysterious. Our proteomics studies reveal that VLPs lack viral coat proteins but possess a pharmacopoeia of (a) eukaryotic vesicular transport system, (b) immunity, and (c) previously unknown proteins. These novel proteins distinguish Lh from Lb VLPs; notably, some proteins specific to Lh VLPs possess sequence similarities with bacterial secretion system proteins. Structure-informed analyses of an abundant Lh VLP surface/spike-tip protein, p40, reveal similarities to the needle-tip invasin proteins SipD/IpaD of Gram negative bacterial type 3 secretion systems that breach immune barriers and deliver virulence factors into mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that Lh VLPs represent a new class of extracellular organelles and share pathways for protein delivery with both eukaryotic microvesicles and bacterial surface secretion systems. Given their mixed prokaryotic/eukaryotic properties, we propose the term Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs) to replace VLP. Keywords: Drosophila, immune suppression, hemocytes, parasitoid wasps, venom, virus-like particles, secretion systems, T3 secretion system, proteomics, mixed strategy extracellular vesiclesGraphical abstract RESULTS Sister Leptopilina species produce different VLPs Larvae of parasitic wasps of the Leptopilina genus feed on Drosophila larval host tissues, and eclose into free-living adults (Fig 1 A). The VLP-producing generalist/specialist L. heterotoma (Lh)/L. boulardi (Lb) wasps differ greatly in their infection of their natural host D. melanogaster, as seen in the anterior lobes of the fly larval lymph glands. Hematopoietic progenitors are housed in the gland’s medulla (marked by Dome-Meso-GFP) and mature hemocytes, in the cortex (GFP-negative, Fig 1 B). Lb 17 infection induces lamellocyte differentiation (Fig 1 C), while Lh 14 attack causes cell loss in both the medulla and the cortex, and few cells survive (Fig 1 D). The differences in the virulence of Lh versus Lb is attributed to differences in the VLPs produced by these wasps [7] and the mechanism of Lh-induced cell killing are not understood. VLPs from Lb 17 and Lh 14 differ in morphology; Lb 17 VLPs have fewer spikes and are somewhat larger than Lh VLPs (Fig 1 E, F) [8]. A peripheral membrane lipid bilayer (~ 10 nm) surrounds Lh VLPs, which lack the typical coat-like structure found in some viruses (Fig 1 G). Because of their key role in wasp parasitism of Drosophila spp. [4, 5], we hypothesized that differences in the composition of spiked particles produced in the venom of both wasps underlie these contrasting infection strategies. Fig 1. Effects of wasp attack on host lymph glands and comparison of VLP morphologies. Open in a new tab (A) Infection by female Leptopilina spp. parasitic wasps introduces not only wasp eggs into the body cavities and hemolymph of fruit fly larvae, but also venom gland products which includes spiked, 300-nm VLPs. VLP bioactivity is known to be necessary for the infective success of L. heterotoma, rather than other venom constituents [6, 9]. (B) Intact anterior lymph gland lobes from uninfected control Dome-MESO-GFP fly larvae. GFP marks the stem-like progenitors in the medulla. (C) Dome-MESO-GFP glands of Lb 17-infected larvae show lamellocyte differentiation (white arrowhead) and lobe dispersal (white arrow). (D) Progenitors are depleted in Dome-MESO-GFP anterior lobes infected with Lh 14. (B – D) White asterisks mark dorsal vessels. (E) Scanning EMs of Lb 17 and (F) Lh 14 VLPs. (G) CryoEM of Lh 14 VLPs: The external lipid bilayer is contiguous, extending from spike bases (black arrows) at the VLP core to spike tips (white arrowhead). The black arrowhead marks area in zoom, bottom right.To characterize Lh VLP proteomes and examine differences in VLP protein compositions fundamental to Lh- versus Lb-specific virulence, we identified a high-confidence proteomic dataset common to VLPs from two independently-isolated, isogenized strains (Lh 14 and Lh NY), whose fine structures and activities on host cells are indistinguishable [3, 9]. Peptide sequences from each VLP proteome (Lh 14 and Lh NY wasps) were first aligned against RNA-Seq Lh 14 transcripts [10], translated to open reading frames (ORFs). We thus obtained a common set of Lh VLP proteins (present in both proteomes; Tables S1, S2) and verified these VLP protein sequences at > 90% identity against two Lh expressed sequence tags (ESTs; ~ 30 proteins or 20% [11] and ~ 70 proteins or 45% [12] of the common proteome). To identify candidate pathogenicity effectors, we compared the common Lh VLP dataset to abdominal transcripts of Lb 17 and a distantly-related species Ganaspis sp.1 (G1) that lacks spiked VLPs [10, 11, 13] (Fig 2). A summary of our major findings follows. Fig 2. Open in a new tab Lh VLP proteome​ Lh VLP proteins are arranged by known/predicted functions and annotations. Key provided in center of figure. (Layer 1, outer most layer) Signal peptide predictions are most commonly found in the categories of virulence, immunity, and novel proteins. (Layer 2) GO (gene ontology) terms for conserved cell biology proteins are abundant. (Layers 3, 4) The cytoskeletal/fibronectin proteins and the majority of novel sequences lack similarity to abdominal transcripts from both (Layer 3) Lb 17 or (Layer 4) G1 female wasps. (See also Tables S1, S2; Data S1, S2.) Lh VLPs are rich in eukaryotic microvesicular proteins No proteins with significant homology to structural proteins of any known virus, including polydnaviruses (PDVs) associated with ichneumonid and braconid wasps, which prey on Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera [14], were found in the Lh proteome. The 161 proteins common to Lh 14 and Lh NY VLP proteomes were categorized as (1) conserved eukaryotic proteins with core biological function (42%, Class 1); (2) virulence/immunity-associated proteins (24%, Class 2); or (3) novel sequences (34%, Class 3) (Figs 2, 3 A). Of the ~ 160 VLP proteins, 25% are Lh-specific (i.e., they are not expressed by Lb 17 [10]) and most (27/41, 66%) of these proteins are novel (Class 3) (Fig 2). Class 1 sequences contain orthologs of Drosophila and mammalian extra- and intracellular vesicle (including microvesicle and exosome) components as well as membrane proteins (Fig 3 A – C). The presence of transmembrane (e.g., Na/K pump, SERCA calcium pump) and vesicle transport proteins (e.g., H+-ATPase, heat shock cognate 70, Rab proteins, and soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) (Figs 2, 3 A – C) in the proteome suggest that Lh VLPs are not viral but instead share functional properties with eukaryotic extracellular organelles called microvesicles, produced by animals cells, and specialized to transfer proteins between different cell types [15]. Fig 3. Lh VLPs are enriched in microvesicular/exosomal and membrane-associated proteins. Open in a new tab (A) Select example Lh VLP proteins, many of which are expected to be membrane-associated via integral or other biochemical mechanisms, are displayed by their proteomic Classes 1 – 3 (bulleted within descriptive subclasses). Example subclasses and individual proteins found in enrichment analyses (B, C) are shown in red. AGT = anterograde transport; RGT = retrograde transport. (B, C) Enrichments from Vesiclepedia: The organelle character of Lh VLPs based on GO Terms of predicted orthologs is (B) significant and (C) highly enriched. (B) Among VLP proteins with annotated orthologs, 71% are mitochondrial, of which 12% are localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane. Approximately 50% of conserved sequences in the proteome are common to microvesicles/exosomes. (C) Vesicular and mitochondrial, including that of the caspase complex, terms are the most over-represented. Furthermore, genes within the GO Term (GO:0008303) for pro-apoptotic caspase complexes were more than 200 times over-represented. (See also Tables S1, S2.)Diverse pathogenicity mechanisms are housed in VLPs Candidate immune-modulating (Class 2) VLP proteins include two diedel-like proteins with high similarities to sequences from insect viruses (60 and 62% similarity to NP_059254.1, Xestia c-nigrum granulovirus; Fig 2; Data S1). Interestingly, a Drosophila diedel modulates the IMD/NF-κB-dependent antimicrobial cascade [16] and the VLP diedel proteins may similarly suppress host signaling. An Lh VLP enhancin-like protein shows similarity to Yersinia spp. enhancins (42% similarity to WP_012413443.1, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis; Fig 2; Data S1), although enhancins are also found in insect viruses [17]. Additional Class 2 immunity and development proteins include: (1) imaginal disc growth factor 4-like sequence (Idgf4) (83% similarity to XP_008560038.1, Microplitis demolitor); (2) fire ant (Solenopsis)-derived venom allergen (62% similarity to XP_008560038.1, Nasonia vitripennis); and (3) B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (89% similarity to XP_008554920.1, Microplitis demolitor) (Fig 2; Data S1). Two VLP proteins may protect and regulate parasite development: an antimicrobial/antifungal-like knottin protein (46% similarity to XP_014233229.1, Trichogramma pretiosum) and a predicted hemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein (56% similarity to ABV82429.1, Drosophila melanogaster) (Fig 2; Data S1) [11]. In the Class 2 set, we also identified two families of invertebrate immunity proteins (Figs 2, 3 A). At least 6 Lh RhoGAPs were found that, like Lb GAP of Lb [18], may inhibit parasite encapsulation. A group of 14 metalloendopeptidases (MEPs) were also identified in the proteome and, although they are structurally similar to proteins from diverse kingdoms, their virulence functions may be similar to those of MEPs from parasitic wasps Venturia canescens [19] and Nasonia vitripennis [20]. The diversity of predicted activities of Class 2 proteins likely facilitates Lh success across a broad range of Drosophila spp. The abundance of novel proteins in Class 3 of the proteome was intriguing. Domain identifications predict viral domains (Pox L5 (PF04872), Baculo_PEP_C (PF04513.10), and Baculo_11_kDa (PF06143.9)) in three VLP sequences [21, 22]. One of these, Baculo_11_kDa VLP sequence also shows similarity to phage tail tape measure proteins (data not shown). In addition to the multiple gene families in Lh VLPs that are common to Lb and G1 (e.g., RhoGAPs and MEPs; Figs 2, 3 A), Lh-specific gene families include fibronectin domain-containing sequences and a new family of GTPases (Figs 2, 3 A; Data S2). Multiple members of gene families are expressed in wasp venoms [23–25], and identification of the gene families in Lh VLPs suggests that gene duplications and neofunctionalization underlie the powerful virulence strategy of Lh.Novel endomembrane-active GTPases Because the novel GTPase peptides are of high abundance in the Lh VLP proteomes and are absent from the Lb abdominal transcriptome, we investigated their predicted structures and functions in detail. All of the three small (SmGTPase) and five large GTPase (LgGTPase) sequences have N-terminal signals for secretion as well as key residues for GTP hydrolysis (Fig 4 A – C; Data S2). Five of the 8 (small and large) GTPase family members possess prokaryotic domains present in eubacterial and/or archaeal (e.g., PF09488, Fig 4 A, A′) proteins. Beyond a few proteins from parasitic wasps (N. vitripennis, G1, and L. clavipes), the closest putative homologs of these GTPases are prokaryotic (Fig 4 B; Data S2). Fig 4. Structural characteristics of prokaryote-like Lh VLP GTPases and p40. Open in a new tab (A, A′) Domain architectures of representative SmGTPase01 (A) and LgGTPase01 (A′) based on Conserved Domains Database (CDD) and PFAM 26.0 (see Methods). (A, A′) SS = signal sequence. Starts/stops are labeled with residue number. The E-values based on CDD domain predictions are listed adjacent to domains. Black and red arrows mark overlapping domain predictions in SmGTPase01 (A) and a highly helical region in LgGTPase0 (A′), respectively. (B) A multi-sequence alignment (MSA) of Sm & LgGTPase01 (SmGTPase01 used as query) reveals that the most significantly similar sequences in the  nr and TSA databases (Lh ESTs excluded) are both prokaryotic and eukaryotic (N = Nasonia; C = Candidatus). Four predicted active site G motifs are labeled below the conserved consensus residues (black boxes) in the MSA. Only the G4 consensus motif ((T/S)KVP) differs from the canonical Ras G4 motif (NKxD) [40]. Asterisks mark 100% conservation in the motifs. The coloring scheme is according to conventional physiochemical properties and sequence conservation. 100% and 99 – 50% conservation levels are indicated by white lettering and blue column boxes, respectively. (C) The predicted geometry of the G motifs in of SmGTPase01 active site (warm, orange tones) superimposed on that of HRas active site (1QRA; cool, blue tones). RMSD = 3.37 Å (calculation is based on the full-length structures and is normalized to 1QRA), TM-score = 0.74 [TM-Score > 0.5 indicates the same fold]. Distances (Å) between functionally critical residues of SmGTPase01 and HRas are indicated by dotted lines. (D) p40 domain architecture. SS = signal sequence; TM = transmembrane domain. Black arrows mark intron insertion sites. Based on CDD prediction, the central domain shares sequence and structural similarity with IpaD superfamily proteins. (E) Structural superposition of IpaD (blue, 2J0; residues 39-284) and p40 model (red, residues 28-187). The N-termini are oriented to the top right corner. The predicted signal sequence and C-terminal transmembrane helix were omitted for modeling. RMSD = 4.73 Å, TM-score = 0.56225. (F) Structural superposition of p40 model (red) to chicken spectrin (green, 1CUN; RMSD = 2.9 Å) and to human plectin (blue, 3PDY; RMSD = 3.0 Å), using the DALI server. (See also Fig S1, Data S2.)The predicted active site of a representative SmGTPase (SmGTPase01) coordinates GTP and the NTPase cofactor, Mg2+. Close alignment of the predicted SmGTPase01 active site with the active site structure of HRas, the canonical small GTPase, supports the domain analyses results (Fig 4 A, A′, & C). The large GTPases are predicted to fold into C-terminal coiled-coils (Fig 4 A′). These findings suggest a curious blend of prokaryotic and eukaryotic properties within this new family of Lh VLP proteins, which likely have GTPase enzymatic activity and are likely secreted from wasp cells for incorporation into vesicles.T3SS-like VLP proteins: Similarities between VLP p40 and bacterial SipD/IpaD Prokaryotic protein motifs were identified in nearly 10% of novel Class 3 sequences. Overlapping protein motifs, [Bacillus PF05103; fungal PF15577] associated with cell division and microtubule binding, respectively, were identified in a single Class 3 protein. KEGG Mapper BlastKAOLA identified (a) Syd-like (SecY-interacting, Type 2 secretion systems) and (b) flgE-like (bacterial flagellar hook) proteins with low-to-mid scores. A sopE-like (bacterial GEF toxin) protein was also found. The presence of bacterial secretion system and flagellar proteins is especially interesting as these macromolecular assemblies are structurally and functionally related and the Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) of the self-assembling bacterial flagella are thought to be ancestral to the ones found in the needle/injectisome of pathogens [26]. Our previous antibody staining and inhibition studies uncovered an abundant 40 kDa surface protein of Lh VLPs (“p40”) which is necessary for lamellocyte lysis [9]. Early in VLP biogenesis, p40 is associated with the membranes of canals that emanate from the cytoplasm of secretory cells of the venom gland, where it is synthesized. Once in the canal lumen, p40 is then associated with membranous vesicles that are released from secretory cells. The vesicles mature into spiked VLPs which carry p40 both on their surfaces and spikes [9, 27]. The bacterial T3SS domain from IpaD/SipD/BipD (PRK15330, E = 7.60−05) proteins was found in residues 39-146 of p40 (Fig 4 D). This assignment was made by peptide mapping, cloning and expressing polyhistidine-tagged p40 in bacteria. In western blot experiments, anti-p40 antibody recognized this bacterially-expressed protein (Fig S1 A). As expected, p40 is detected in wasp venom extracts (Fig S1 B). We were unable to identify a putative Lb 17 or G1 p40 ortholog (Fig 2) and, to our knowledge, p40 represents the first eukaryotic protein with an IpaD/SipD-like domain. IpaD-like proteins from Shigella/Salmonella/Burkholderia spp. are tip proteins of T3SS injectisomes, mediating contact and regulated delivery of effectors into the host cytoplasm of non-phagocytic cells [28]. IpaD expression in mammalian macrophages triggers apoptosis [29], reminiscent of the TUNEL-positive death of fly macrophages upon Lh infection [7]. Unlike the bacterial proteins, p40 is predicted to encode a C-terminal transmembrane helix in addition to an N-terminal secretion signal (Figs 4 D; S1 C). p40’s transmembrane domain (this study) and its extracellular localization in venom gland canals [27] suggest that p40 exits venom gland secretory cells in association with microvesicle-like structures. This interpretation is in agreement with the extracellular vesicular proteomic profile of VLPs (Fig 3). Given the unexpected parallels in their structures and surface/tip localizations, we hypothesized that, like IpaD/SipD on the T3SS injectisome, p40 on VLP spikes facilitates invasive contact with the plasma membrane of non-phagocytic lamellocytes to deliver VLP contents. To test this idea, we carried out ab initio modeling of p40. The knowledge-based energetics of the p40 model are similar to crystal structures of similar length (ProSA Z-Score = −6.23). 82% of model residues are found in expected local environments (3D Verify). Superimposition of the p40 model against IpaD confirmed the T3SS protein-like fold in p40 (Figs 4 E; S1 C) [30]. Surprisingly, high-scoring matches to this fold included the vertebrate actin-binding proteins spectrin and plectin (Fig 4 F, superimposed with p40), further strengthening structural parallels between p40 and IpaD/SipD. Searches for the most similar structures within the N-terminal half of IpaD family proteins also returned actin-binding proteins (talin, vinculin, α-catenin) [31]. These proteins are known to reprogram the actin cytoskeleton leading to the profuse membrane ruffling observed in non-phagocytic mammalian cell invasions by Salmonella and Shigella [31].DISCUSSION The composition of Lh VLPs is complex and interesting in multiple respects but the most conspicuous observations are an absence of viral structural proteins and the presence of conserved eukaryotic proteins with microvesicular signature. Abundant Lh-unique proteins, including currently novel proteins, have an unexpected diversity of domains, especially those previously found exclusively in prokaryotic proteins. The mechanisms that contributed to the evolution of VLP proteins (horizontal gene transfer or others [32]) remain unknown. Lh VLPs lack the defined symmetry and external coat found in many true viruses including PDVs. Reminiscent of eukaryotic organelles, precursors and mature VLPs exhibit heterogeneity in their shapes, sizes, and spike numbers [9, 33]. Moreover, it is noteworthy that, unlike PDVs which are fully formed in the cells of their origin and then released by lysis or budding [14], Leptopilina VLPs assume their final shape outside the cells in which at least some of their proteins and vesicular constituents are synthesized [9, 27]. Also, there is currently no evidence for the presence of nucleic acids in VLPs, which further distinguishes them from DNA-containing PDVs. VLPs are unlike endosymbiotic bacteria of Leptopilina wasps [34]. Antibiotic-treatment of L. victoriae (sister species of Lh that make VLPs and carry cytoplasmic-incompatibility-inducing Wolbachia) did not affect genomic amplification of p40 or SmGTPase01 genes. Furthermore, VLP gene loci were amplified not only from female Lh 14 genomes but also male wasp genomes, even though VLPs are not produced in males. BrdU incorporation studies did not support the possibility of DNA-based VLP replication in the venom gland (our unpublished results). The non-replicating nature of the particles, genomic encoding of VLP protein genes, and vesicular signature of their proteome strongly suggest that Lh VLPs are neither viruses nor endosymbiotic bacteria but instead represent a new class of genomically-encoded, microvesicle-like organelles. Extracellular vesicles are produced by prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and VLPs carry a diversity of potential immune-suppressive proteins. We, thus, propose the alternative moniker, MSEV (Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles), to replace the VLP term. Virulence factors of parasitic wasps have diversified in response to the variety and complexities of their hosts’ immune systems. With a broad host range [3], Lh wasps parasitize many Drosophila spp. whose own distinct immune responses are supported by varying numbers and types of blood cells [35]. This may explain, first, the diversity of putative virulence and cell death proteins with homologs across the biological kingdoms [viral (diedel), bacterial (p40, Syd-like), and eukaryotic (fire ant allergen, B-cell receptor-associated protein 31, etc.)], and second, the presence of MSEV paralogs [Lh-specific GTPase and Lh-/Lb-common Rho GAP, MEPs, and diedel gene families] in the proteome. Multiple members presumably perform redundant or overlapping cell-specific functions for rapid and robust immune suppression, much like the IκB/Cactus-like ankyrin-repeat proteins of distantly-related bracoviral and ichnoviral PDV proteins that block NF-κB signaling [36, 37]. The parallels between the 3D-structure and locations of p40 with the well-characterized T3SS IpaD-like prokaryotic proteins are provocative and suggest that p40 likely contributes to Lh MSEVs’ unique blood cell-killing activities. T3SS assemblies are widespread and are used by bacteria to infect plants and animals [26]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa use their own T3SS to rapidly infect and kill adult flies. While cytotoxic to macrophages, P. aeruginosa infection activates the NF-κB-dependent IMD antimicrobial pathway [38]. It is thus possible that elements of the pathogenic bacterial systems have been co-opted by wasps to attack the fly’s cellular immune system. In this scenario, intracellular protein complexes within lamellocytes would be under direct selective pressure to respond to MSEV-based T3SS-like virulence. The presence of prokaryotic-like (particularly, T3SS/flagellar-like) proteins, hints at the possibility that either MSEV spikes evolved from primordial flagellar/needle-like structures or they share evolutionary history with such structures. These findings also support a hypothesis proposed by Martin and colleagues [39] that the eukaryotic endomembrane system may have arisen from bacterial outer membrane vesicles. In this regard, characterization of the prokaryotic protein motifs that comprise nearly 10% of the novel proteins outlined above will be especially revealing. The molecular mechanisms by which MSEV proteins deplete and destroy its well-characterized hosts’ immune system will suggest how virulence factors are acquired by insect parasites, how these factors evolve, and how insects might serve as reservoirs of disease. Answering these questions is likely to lead to new cost-effective therapies for treating emerging infections and opportunistic diseases.STAR METHODS CONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARING Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Shubha Govind (sgovind@ccny.cuny.edu).EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Fly strains All fly stocks were healthy and free of common laboratory infections. Genetically stable stocks with the desired, uniform genotypes were used for infections and crosses were not necessary. The y w strain of D. melanogaster (used as wild type) and Dome-MESO-GFP (gift from M. Crozatier [41]) (see Key Resource Table (KRT)) were used. Dome-MESO-GFP is a synthetic construct that replaces lacZ with GFP expression in P{dome-lacZ.MESO} (Fly Base FBtp0022619) and produces GFP marked regions of domeless (the fly JAK/STAT receptor) expression [41]. Flies were raised on standard fly food [cornmeal (65 g/L), sucrose (140 g/L), agar (10 g/L), and yeast (35 g/L) with tegosept made in 95% ethanol (22.6 ml/L) and propionic acid (5 ml/L)] (see KRT) medium and maintained long term at 18°C with inspection and flipping to new vials every three to four weeks. Prior to experimental work, fly stocks were moved to fresh food, shifted to 25°C, and maintained for at least two generations. Adults were used for 2 to 3 rounds of egglays to produce larvae for wasp infections. Mid to late second instar larvae (both male and female) were used for infections and sacrificed during dissection. Leptopilina spp. parasitoid wasp strains All wasp stocks were healthy and free of common laboratory infections. The following wild type parasitoid wasp species and strains were used: Leptopilina heterotoma 14 (Lh 14) [3], L. heterotoma NY (Lh NY) [9], L. victoriae (Lv) [33], and L. boulardi 17 (Lb 17) [3]. (A detailed genotypic notation system has not been formalized for Leptopilina spp. as mutant or transgenic wasps have not been produced to date.) Lh (strains 14 and NY) and L. victoriae are sister species with VLPs that are indistinguishable from each other [9]. Wasp stocks were maintained at 18°C long-term via infestation of healthy and infection-free mid to late second instar y w D. melanogaster larvae raised on the same fly food medium as the “fly-alone” cultures (see Fly Strain details, above, for husbandry and housing of flies). Adult wasps were moved to 25°C prior to experimental infections. Free-living, adult female wasps were collected with males at approximately one week post eclosion (PE). Mated females were used in experimental infections and were used for infections only once. For VLP purification, female wasps were sorted from males for dissection of venom gland apparatus (males do not possess venom glands).Bacteria E. coli BL21 cells (see KRT for genotype) were used for expression of the p40 central domain (CD).METHOD DETAILS Wasp infections, dissections, and imaging For experimental infections, cultures containing both male and female mid to late second instar D. melanogaster larvae were exposed to 10 – 12 mated, 1 week PE, Lh 14 or Lb 17 female wasps [3] for 12 hours at 25°C. Wasps were removed and larvae were allowed to recover in the medium for 5 hours at 25°C. Infected larvae were scooped from the medium, scored for age, matched to y w control wasp-infected larvae, washed in deionized water, washed in phosphate buffered saline (1X PBS, pH 7.2, 25°C), and dissected to obtain larval lymph gland tissue. Infection was validated during dissection by the presence of wasp eggs (free floating or attached onto larval gut tissue) and uninfected hosts were discarded. Dissections and slide preparations were performed at 25°C. Tissue was dissected on untreated glass slides by bleeding larvae and pulling the cuticle bilaterally below the mouth hooks to leave the mouth parts, lymph gland, and dorsal vessel. After air drying, excess tissue was removed. Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, permeabilized (1X PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100), and washed again in 1X PBS. Counterstains were applied (Rhodamine-tagged Phalloidin at 0.5 mg/ml and Hoechst 33258 at 0.02 mg/mL) and samples were washed and then mounted in VectaShield. Samples were imaged with a Zeiss 510 confocal at 40X. Laser settings were based on GFP negative and uninfected control tissue and all images were scanned using the same instrument settings. Images were processed with Zeiss LSM image browser. Figures were compiled in Adobe Photoshop v12.0.4 and CC 2015.5 and Illustrator CC 2015. Results shown in Fig 1 were validated in dissections of at least twenty animals (n = 20 lymph glands) each, infected by either wasp. Results have also been validated by infections and dissection of at least three other D. melanogaster genotypes with replicates of at least five animals (n = 5 lymph glands). All infection-related changes to lymph gland morphologies were included in our conclusions (no data were excluded). No strategies for randomization and/or stratification, blinding, or sample-size estimation were utilized, or found to be necessary, for this study.VLP purification Three hundred each Lh 14 [3] and Lh NY [9] female wasps (see Wasp Strain section, above, for husbandry and housing details) of 1 to 2 weeks PE were sacrificed by submerging in 70% ethanol and rinsed at least three times each in deionized water and 0.1X PBS (pH 7.2) at 4°C. Venom gland complexes were dissected in PBS by grasping the ovipositor and gently pulling. Only intact, dissected venom gland complexes with a VLP long gland, reservoir, and ovipositor were used in the purification protocol; other body parts were discarded. Tissue was collected in 1X PBS (4°C), gently crushed with a sterile pestle in 200μL of 1X PBS (4°C), shook vigorously in 300 μL 1X PBS (4°C), pulse agitated, and added to the top of a 4°C Nycodenz gradient. The gradient of 50 to 10% Nycodenz in 1X PBS (5 bands of 900 μL, each) was prepared in a clean, RNA-free Beckman 9 cm centrifuge tube and pre-chilled. Whole VLPs were separated from other tissues into a single band by ultracentrifugation (20,000 RPM, 7°C, 80 mins). The VLP band was removed from the gradient, washed with 1X PBS (4°C), pelleted (11,700 RPM, 7°C, 35 mins), resuspended in a minimum of 1X PBS (4°C), and stored (4°C). Extraction of VLPs from ~ 300 long gland complexes has consistently yielded upwards of thousands of VLPs.Electron microscopy For cryo electron microscopy (EM), purified VLPs were pipetted onto a holey carbon coated grid. Excess fluid was blotted (Whatman #1) and the grid was plunge frozen (liquid ethane) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Samples were visualized with a Technai G2 (200kV) at the New York Structural Biology Center. Membrane surrounding Lh VLPs (observed via cryo EM in Fig 1) was present in all VLPs of more than two sample preparations and this result confirmed previously-published findings from transmission electron microscopy experiments [6, 9]. For scanning EM (SEM), purified VLPs (washed and re-suspended, PBS) were fixed in glutaraldehyde (3% in 0.085M sodium cacodylate buffer, overnight, 4°C), followed by cacodylate buffer (0.085M, 1 hr, 4°C). After washing (glass distilled water) and fixing in osmium tetroxide (1% in 0.085M cacodylate buffer, 1 hr, 4°C), VLPs were filtered onto polycarbonate membranes (0.1 μm pores). Filtered samples were then dehydrated in serial ethanol washes (technical grade, to 70%) and stored overnight. The membranes were washed (amyl acetate), dried, and mounted on pin stubs. Membranes were gold-palladium plated and stored at 60°C until imaged on a Ziess Supra 55 SEM. Parameters for SEM imaging of Lh, Lv, and Lb VLPs were consistent for all samples and technical replicates; data presented are representative of many particles from at least two replicates per species’ VLP.MS/MS analysis of Lh VLP proteins Purified VLPs were separated on a 1-D SDS-PAGE gel as per standard protocols. Bands were excised, destained, reduced, alkylated, and trypsin digested. Peptides from combined additional lanes (L457) were also analyzed. Peptides were extracted (Applied Biosystems POROS 20 R2 beads), cleaned-up (C18 ZipTips), dried, and reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid. Lh 14 peptides were trapped (Waters Symmetry® C18 trap column (180 μm × 100 mm, 5 μm particles)), washed, and separated on a Waters BEH130 C18 column (1.7 μm particle size) (Waters NanoAcquity UPLC (Milford, MA)). Lh NY peptides were separated on a Waters BEH130 C18 column (75 μm × 150 mm). The MS analysis was performed on an LTQ-Orbitrap (ThermoFisher, CA). The instrument RAW files were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer (PD) 1.4.0.288 with a work template that contained a Target Decoy PSM Validator node (peptide spectrum matches) with both Sequest and Mascot algorithms. Mascot searches, independent of PD, were also conducted. Peptide mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, and the fragment mass tolerance was 0.6 Da. The enzyme was set to “trypsin” with two maximum missed cleavage sites and the search was against VLPSwiss_20140319.fasta (1332969 entries). Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. Deamidation of asparagine and glutamine and oxidation of histidine, methionine and tryptophan were specified as variable modifications. Methylation at aspartic acid residues was specified only for Mascot analyses conducted without PD. The .msf output files were integrated into Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.7.3, Proteome Software Inc.) which was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications.Identification of Lh VLP proteins VLP proteins (Tables S1, S2) reported here had at least two proteomic peptides, identified at 99% or greater probability by either PD or solo Mascot searches, that aligned to a target sequence. In addition, four proteins are included in the list where only one peptide aligned at 99% more probability (see below, Protein sequence annotations subsection). Full-length target protein sequences were translated from RNA-Seq Lh 14 (GAJC00000000.1) transcripts translated to ORFs [10]. The number of aligned peptides varied slightly between PD and Mascot analyses conducted without PD. The PD results have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE [42] partner repository (see KRT for link). In this report, VLP composition is based on the subset of proteins common to both the Lh 14 and NY strains. The common, full-length VLP protein ORFs (Tables S1, S2) were annotated via (A) primary sequence analyses, and (B) structure-based analyses and predictions for select proteins (described below). Note that the Lh 14 dataset is larger and select Lh 14-unique sequences were preferentially included.Additional verification of protein sequences The VLP peptides were also searched against other proteomes (Uniprot D. melanogaster, A. mellifera, H. sapiens, viral, prokaryotic and archaea databases [43]). The full-length proteins identified from the RNA-Seq ORFs [10] were BLASTed against Lh ESTs ( LIBEST 028179 and 028205, [11, 12]), providing an alternative method of ORF sequence verification. This step also identified the full, or near full, length VLP protein clones in our Lh EST collection (e.g., Lh VLP Sm & LgGTPas01). Roughly 20% and ~ 45% of the common VLP proteins were identified in the Heavner et al. 2013 [11] and the Colinet et al. 2013 [12] studies. (See below, for methods of identification of absence/presence of expression of each Lh VLP protein in Lb 17 and G1 abdominal transcriptomes (Fig 2).)Protein sequence annotations The automated, pipe-line annotation algorithms of (1) BLAST2GO, E <= 10−5 (v2.7.0) [44], (2) InterProScan (v5.3–46) [45], and (3) FastAnnotator [46] were used to characterize all (common set) VLP proteins identified from VLP peptide alignments to Lh transcriptome ORFs (See above). Multiple bioinformatic methods were used to avoid algorithm bias and increase accuracy. Two related criteria were used as measures of reliability of annotations: (a) E values (E <= 10−5); and (b) percent identity and percent similarity (applied only when at least 75% of the query aligned to the hit). For manual annotations, BLASTs were conducted via  [47] (nr and TSA databases, default parameters [48]). To identify potential Lh VLP protein homologs in microbiota, the unannotated full-length VLP proteins were pBLAST searched against a subset of all nr archaea, viruses, and prokaryotic genomes at higher sensitivity (GenBank, E <= 10). To identify Lh VLP proteins expressed by Lb 17 and G1, all VLP sequences were tBLASTn searched with default parameters against GAJA00000000.1 (Lb 17) and GAIW00000000.1 transcriptomes (Ganaspis sp1 (G1)) [10]. The Conserved Domains Database (CDD) [49, 50] and PFAM [51] were used for domain identifications and architectures. Manual annotation results are reported in main text only if they were confirmed by a second method. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology (KO) numbers were assigned using GhostKOALA [52]. KO numbers were then used to obtain model ortholog annotations. For pairwise and multiple-sequence alignments, T-Coffee [53], Needleman [54], ClustalOmega [55], and MUSCLE [56, 57] (EBI webserver, default parameters) were used and ESPript 3.0 [58] was used for visualizations. FunRich [59] was used for functional enrichment and over-representation analyses against two extracellular vesicle databases, Exocarta [60, 61] and Vesiclepedia [62]. Circos (v0.69) was used to visualize the proteome [63]. The four proteins with only on a single aligned peptide (99% or greater peptide probability) (Fig 3; Tables S1, S2) passed the (1) manual inspections of their MS/MS spectra and fragments, (2) solo Mascot searches, and (3) Exocarta/Vesiclepedia enrichment analyses. Of these four proteins, one is classified as novel (Class 3; Figs 2, 3 A), while the other three have sequence similarities with eukaryotic proteins (Class 1; Fig 2, 3) of extracellular vesicles (Fig 3 B, C). In silico structural predictions of SmGTPase01 A high-quality structural model was created for SmGTPase01 using a hybrid approach. A MODELLER [64] model was created using three templates: GIMAP crystal structure 3V70 and two ab initio models [65]. 3V70 was chosen using threading metaservers (LOMETS [66] and PHYRE2 [67]) and was evaluated in single-template MODELLER trials. Loop modeling and side-chain optimization were done using Loopy [68] and SCWRL4 [69], respectively. The active site of this full-length model is presented in Fig 4 C; the remaining details of the model will be published elsewhere. The SmGTPase01 co-factor, Mg2+, was placed in the active site based on COFACTOR [70] and was checked for positioning using WHAT IF [71]. GTP was placed and checked for energy minimization in the SmGTPase01 active site with Autodock Vina [72]. The cofactor and substrate placements were confirmed with predictions from COACH [73], BSP-SLIM [74], and 3D Ligand [75]. The qualities and knowledge-based energy values of our models were assessed using ProSA-web [76] and Verify3D [77]. TM-Align was used to compare crystal structures and our in silico models [30]. STRIDE [78] was used to define secondary structures from molecular coordinates. Crystal structure molecular files came from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do).Cloning and structural predictions of p40 For p40-specific proteomics, peptides isolated and digested from an anti-p40 positive SDS-PAGE gel band were sequenced at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility by HPLC-MS/MS (Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap) and then BLAST queried against  GAJC00000000.1 RNA-Seq Lh 14 database. For p40 cloning and expression, the p40 IpaD-like central domain (CD) was amplified from venom gland cDNA and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO. Primer sequences are listed in Key Resource Table. The p40 central domain (amino acids 26 – 240, Fig 4 D) was expressed from a pTrcHisA subclone by addition of IPTG (1 mM, ThermoFisher Scientific). E. coli BL21cells were lysed by freeze-thaw in lysis buffer (10% triton X, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8) with protease inhibitors (AEBSF-HCl 100 mM, aprotinin 80 μM, bestatin 5 mM, E-64 1.5 mM, leupeptin 2 mM, pepstatin A 1 mM, Sigma or Fermentas). Protein concentrations in all assays were determined with Bradford reagent [79]. For the verification of p40 identity via western analyses, bacterial proteins were separated (SDS-PAGE, 5% stacking and 12% resolving), transferred to membrane (nitrocellulose, HyBond, Amersham Life Science), and blocked (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1 % Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk, 3% bovine serum albumin (1 hr, 25°C)). Primary antibodies used were anti-p40 (1:1000) or anti-6X-His (1:1000; 12 hr, 4°C). Alkaline-phosphatase-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2,500; 1 hour, 25°C), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolyphosphate (BCIP, Amresco), and nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT, Biotium) solutions in NaCl-Tris-MgCl2 buffer (NTM, pH 9.5) were used for detection. For p40 structural predictions, ab initio and template fragment assembly methods [80] [65] were used along with N-terminal predictions from MODELLER’s loop methods [81–83]. Structural optimizations were generated using ModRefiner [84]. The most N- and C-terminal residues of p40 are predicted to be a signal peptide and transmembrane helix and were not modeled (Fig S1 C). Crystal structures (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) similar to our in silico p40 model were identified using DaliLITE [85].Antibiotic treatment of Lv To cure Lv adults of the strain of Gram negative Wolbachia endosymbionts [34], three successive generations of Lv females were cultivated from infections of y w D. melanogaster egglays on fly food medium containing rifampicin at 0.75 mg/g (see Fly and Wasp Strain sections, above, for husbandry and housing details). The next six generations of Lv wasps were cultivated on larvae raised on standard, antibiotic-free medium, to assure no direct drug effects. Isogenized control wasps did not receive antibiotic treatment and were otherwise reared the same way as experimental wasps. For PCR amplification of wasp genomic DNA, antibiotic-treated and control male and female wasps, no more than 1 week PE, were sorted into microfuge tubes and frozen at −20°C. Genomic DNA template was amplified for the absence or presence of (a) Lv-specific gatB and coxA genes of Wolbachia, and (b) VLP protein genes (p40 and Sm/LgGTPase01) (see Analyses of genomic sequences, below, and KRT). Results from all PCR amplification experiments supported the conclusions in this study.Analyses of genomic sequences Total genomic DNA from Lh, antibiotic-treated Lv, and control wasps was obtained using a Qiagen DNA Blood and Tissue kit. Primer sequences are listed in KRT; the following notation is used: y = pyrimidines; r = purines; and k = T and G.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Details regarding experimental replicates are provided with each Method. As indicated in the Wasp infections, dissections, and imaging subsection, n in this study refers to the whole lymph gland of an animal (i.e., two lobes). More than 35 lymph glands from larvae of different genotypes yielded consistent results after wasp infection. Similarly, examination of numerous VLPs in each sample, as well as repetition of different EM protocols provided supporting information regarding VLP morphologies. Confidence in proteomics results is based on peptide characterizations of purified VLP preparations from two independent strains of Lh. The criteria of agreement between multiple, independent methods for identification and annotation of VLP proteins (both novel and previously characterized) were met. Confidence in quantitative bioinformatics results (e.g., E values for BLAST results and domain predictions, RMSDs for protein model analyses, p-values for enrichments) is based on the algorithms intrinsic to these methods and is described in the corresponding primary references. Where possible, more than one computational approach (supported by different algorithms and metaservers) was used to strengthen interpretation by avoiding biases arising from a single computational methodology. No additional statistical analyses or methods to determine assumption credibility and/or sample size were conducted for this study.DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY .mzid files for all VLP protein gel bands for both L. heterotoma 14 and NY (see MS/MS analysis of Lh VLP proteins methodology, above) were exported from Scaffold and submitted to PRIDE, a ProteomeXchange repository member (see KRT for links). .mzid files provide the data for VLP peptide identification in the mzIdentML proteomics format (Tables S1, S2), a HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative (Proteomics Informatics Standards group) standard.Supplementary Material 1. Figure S1: Western analyses for p40 expression and comparison of the p40 3D model to IpaD crystal structure (Related to Main Figure 4 D-F). (A) Anti-p40 antibody reacts at the expected molecular weight (top bands) for the His-tagged p40 central domain (CD, residues 26-240) from bacterial extracts, and (B) with venom extracts (VGE) from L. heterotoma (Lh) and L. victoriae (Lv) female wasps. In panel A, S=supernatant; P=pellet. Uninduced and induced refer to bacterial extracts prepared without or with IPTG induction for p40 CD expression. p40's identity was also confirmed with anti-His antibody (not shown). The p40-positive bands at higher molecular weights (B) suggest higher-order protein associations and/or post-translational modifications. (C) Comparison of the Shigella flexneri IpaD (2J0O) structure and L. heterotoma p40 model (Figure 4 E): The residue numbers for the p40 model do not include the predicted signal peptide. The first and last model residues are 26 and 213 of the predicted full length protein, respectively. The p40 model lacks the short α-helix and β-hairpin at residues 208-251 in IpaD and the model's local quality drops in this region. 310 helices are found in the p40 model, in addition to α-helices. 310 and α-helices psi/phi angles are similar. These 310 helices could render as α-helices, given slight conformational and energetic shifts in the model. Experimental methods are necessary to validate these p40 model predictions.

MS899633-supplement-3.xlsx (698.4KB, xlsx) 4Data S1: Select infection- and immunity-related Lh VLP protein alignments (Related to Figs 2, 3A) Seven (A–G) Class 2 Lh VLP proteins aligned with their most similar putative homologs from prokaryotic, viral, and eukaryotic species (emphasis on Hymenotpera and Diptera). If sequences were trimmed, the absolute residue range is given following the species of origin. The coloring scheme is based on physiochemical properties. ORF = open reading frame (A) Two diedel-like Lh VLP sequences with pfam13164 domains identified (E = 2.29e−12 and 1.17e−07, diedel-like 1 and 2, respectively) are aligned with nine similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 25 – 53% identity; 7e−08 <= E <= 3e−01). Five of the putative homologs are from Drosophila spp. and are four from dsDNA insect viruses (granulovirus, ascovirus, and entomopoxvirus). Both sequences contain secretion signal motifs, and multiple predicted disulfide bridges. The D. melanogaster diedel, a putative homolog, is a negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway. (B) A Lh VLP enhancin-like protein is aligned with similar prokaryotic sequences (BLAST2GO and Delta BLAST nr, 20 – 42% identity; 5.33e−04 <= E <= 9e−03). Multiple sequences from Yersinia, Listeria, and other pathogenic bacterial species were found in our BLASTs and, in a few cases, these sequences were annotated as M60 peptidases. The VLP sequence contains a putative secretion signal motif, but no known domains were identified. It is notable that enhancin homologs encoded in viral genomes were not uncovered in our searches. (C) A Lh VLP GH18 chitinase-like superfamily (CDD cd02873 domain, E = 0) protein is aligned with five similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 50 – 75% identity; 0 <= E <= 2 e−143) from other insects, including the yellow-fever mosquito, the Tobacco horn worm, and three parasitoid wasps (the Jewel and two Braconid wasps). The VLP protein sequence encodes a predicted secretion signal and is predicted to be an Imaginal disc growth factor (Idgf)-like protein, a superfamily that diverged from chitinase-like proteins. (D) The Lh VLP venom allergen-like (CDD domain cd05380, E = 1.95 e−42) protein is aligned with five similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 37 – 42% identity; 6 e−41<= E <= 6 e−34) from other insects, including the red imported fire ant, the Panamanian leafcutter ant, and three parasitoid wasps (Jewel, a Braconid wasp, and a Chalcidoid egg parasite). A eukaryotic-specific SCP domain, best characterized in plant pathogenesis defense proteins, has been identified, as well as a putative secretion signal. (E) The Lh VLP Bap31-like (CDD domain cd05380, E = 1.95 e−42) protein is aligned with five similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 59 – 76% identity; 1 e−126 <= E <= 4 e−83) from other insects, including two species of ant (Florida carpenter and red imported fire ant), wasp (a Braconid and the Jewel parasitoid), and Drosophila mojavensis. Canonical Bap31 proteins regulate ER-stress-mediated apoptosis. Similar to these proteins, the Lh VLP protein is predicted to encode three transmembrane helices. (F) The Lh VLP knottin-like (pfam11410 domain, E = 5.19 e−03) protein is aligned with five similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 33 – 52% identity; 3 e−08 <= E <= 2 e−02), four from insect species and one from the eudicotyledon, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. Among the most similar putative homologs are sequences from diverse insects: Hymenoptera (sawfly and wasp), Diptera, and Hemipteran species. The sequence contains a putative secretion signal motif and three predicted disulfide bridges. 40% of the VLP sequence shows notable conservation (54% identity) when compared to a secreted ion channel toxin from the spider Chilobrachys guangxiensis (Arachnida: Theraphosidae). Knottins are classified as a cystine-rich plant antimicrobial peptide family. (G) The Lh VLP hemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP)-like (pfam06585 domain, E = 6.10 e−17) protein is aligned with four similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 24 – 30% identity; 1 e−11 <= E <= 6 e−03) from a wheat stem sawfly, the Panamanian leafcutter ant, the diamondback moth, and Drosophila melanogaster. No high identity homologs were found, but moderately similar homologs were found encoded by wasps, ants, and arthropods, in general. Homologs in Drosophila spp. were found, but are not functionally well characterized. The regions of similarities are within 80 to 90% of the length of the VLP protein sequence, but largely only in comparisons to putative homologs from other hymenoptera. MS899633-supplement-4.pdf (13.5MB, pdf) 5Data S2: Lh VLP GTPase alignments (Related to Figs 2, 3A, & 4A – C) This document provides alignments of select small and large VLP GTPases (including SmGTPases01/LgGTPases01) with putative homologs/paralogs from (A) Lh; (B) prokaryotic and eukaryotic species; (C) Ganaspis sp.1 (G1); and (D, E) Leptopilina clavipes (Lc). The far N-and C-termini show the most variation among the sequences and were trimmed. The residue range displayed is indicated after the species of origin. The coloring scheme is according to physiochemical properties. ORF = open reading frame. (A) Eight Lh VLP GTPases are presented here. Additional putative GTPase family members exist, but are not presented here. The first three sequences of ~ 300 residues, are SmGTPases, while the following five sequences of ~ 500 residues are LgGTPases. Among the eight family members shown here, the percent similarities within the N-terminal regions range from ~ 25 to 60% and average pairwise similarity over their full lengths is 45%. Only seven insertion/deletion sites exist in this 222 amino acid alignment and large blocks of identity (> 80% of the alignment length) are present. Highly similar secretion signal peptides are predicted at the N-termini of all GTPases (not shown). (B) The five most-similar ORFs found in the  TSA transcriptome for G1 (GAIW00000000.1) are shown aligned with Lh VLP Sm/LgGTPase01s. Like the Lh VLP GTPases, several putative G1 GTPases have predicted secretion signal peptides (not shown). Potential G1 homologs demonstrate >= 31% and 35% identity (E <= 3e−03 and 4e−59) to Lh VLP SmGTPase01 and LgGTPase01, respectively (given 75% alignment coverage). (C) The five most-similar ORFs found in the  TSA transcriptome for Lc (GAXY00000000.2) are shown aligned with Lh VLP Sm/LgGTPase01s. Similar to Lh and G1 GTPases, multiple Lc GTPases have predicted signal sequence peptides. The Lc transcripts identified show similarity in the N-terminal G domain, but are generally much shorter than the Lh VLP GTPases. Lh VLP SmGTPase01 shows <= 34% identity to Lc transcripts (>= 75% alignment criterion, E >= 2e−34) and LgGTPase01 shows <= 44% identity (E >= 3e−99), respectively. Lc also parasitizes Drosophila spp., but its comparative virulence and phylogenetic distance are poorly characterized in comparison to Lh and Lb. (D) The most similar Lh and Lc sequences have been extracted from (C) and are shown here.

Supplementary Materials 1. Figure S1: Western analyses for p40 expression and comparison of the p40 3D model to IpaD crystal structure (Related to Main Figure 4 D-F). (A) Anti-p40 antibody reacts at the expected molecular weight (top bands) for the His-tagged p40 central domain (CD, residues 26-240) from bacterial extracts, and (B) with venom extracts (VGE) from L. heterotoma (Lh) and L. victoriae (Lv) female wasps. In panel A, S=supernatant; P=pellet. Uninduced and induced refer to bacterial extracts prepared without or with IPTG induction for p40 CD expression. p40's identity was also confirmed with anti-His antibody (not shown). The p40-positive bands at higher molecular weights (B) suggest higher-order protein associations and/or post-translational modifications. (C) Comparison of the Shigella flexneri IpaD (2J0O) structure and L. heterotoma p40 model (Figure 4 E): The residue numbers for the p40 model do not include the predicted signal peptide. The first and last model residues are 26 and 213 of the predicted full length protein, respectively. The p40 model lacks the short α-helix and β-hairpin at residues 208-251 in IpaD and the model's local quality drops in this region. 310 helices are found in the p40 model, in addition to α-helices. 310 and α-helices psi/phi angles are similar. These 310 helices could render as α-helices, given slight conformational and energetic shifts in the model. Experimental methods are necessary to validate these p40 model predictions. MS899633-supplement-1.pdf (2.2MB, pdf) 2. Table S1: ORFs identified via alignment to Lh VLP peptides (Related to Figs 2, 3).A summary of proteomic data for proteins common to Lh 14 (Gel01) and Lh NY (Gel02) VLPs purified on Nycodenz gradients is presented here. The data are organized by our in-house VLP_Swiss-Prot identifiers. The wasp strain (column 6) from which the greatest number of VLP protein peptides were detected is provided first (columns 2 – 5). Data shown include protein identification probability, peptide to protein alignment coverage, exclusive unique spectra, and exclusive unique peptides. The number of unique peptides detected from the second Lh strain’s VLPs (column 8) for each protein is given in column 7. MS899633-supplement-2.xlsx (50.4KB, xlsx) 3. Table S2: Detailed report of proteomic peptides and modifications (Related to Figs 2, 3).This table provides additional information not presented in the peptide-to-ORF table (Table S1). The peptide sequences detected for each protein from both Lh 14 (Gel01) and Lh NY (Gel02) VLP preparations are provided along with post-translational modifications (columns 1, 2, and 11, respectively). The SDS-PAGE gel band of origin for each peptide can be found in column 23 (i.e., spectrum file ID). Any redundancies in protein identifications per peptide are provided in columns 21 and 22. MS899633-supplement-3.xlsx (698.4KB, xlsx) 4Data S1: Select infection- and immunity-related Lh VLP protein alignments (Related to Figs 2, 3A) Seven (A–G) Class 2 Lh VLP proteins aligned with their most similar putative homologs from prokaryotic, viral, and eukaryotic species (emphasis on Hymenotpera and Diptera). If sequences were trimmed, the absolute residue range is given following the species of origin. The coloring scheme is based on physiochemical properties. ORF = open reading frame (A) Two diedel-like Lh VLP sequences with pfam13164 domains identified (E = 2.29e−12 and 1.17e−07, diedel-like 1 and 2, respectively) are aligned with nine similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 25 – 53% identity; 7e−08 <= E <= 3e−01). Five of the putative homologs are from Drosophila spp. and are four from dsDNA insect viruses (granulovirus, ascovirus, and entomopoxvirus). Both sequences contain secretion signal motifs, and multiple predicted disulfide bridges. The D. melanogaster diedel, a putative homolog, is a negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway. (B) A Lh VLP enhancin-like protein is aligned with similar prokaryotic sequences (BLAST2GO and Delta BLAST nr, 20 – 42% identity; 5.33e−04 <= E <= 9e−03). Multiple sequences from Yersinia, Listeria, and other pathogenic bacterial species were found in our BLASTs and, in a few cases, these sequences were annotated as M60 peptidases. The VLP sequence contains a putative secretion signal motif, but no known domains were identified. It is notable that enhancin homologs encoded in viral genomes were not uncovered in our searches. (C) A Lh VLP GH18 chitinase-like superfamily (CDD cd02873 domain, E = 0) protein is aligned with five similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 50 – 75% identity; 0 <= E <= 2 e−143) from other insects, including the yellow-fever mosquito, the Tobacco horn worm, and three parasitoid wasps (the Jewel and two Braconid wasps). The VLP protein sequence encodes a predicted secretion signal and is predicted to be an Imaginal disc growth factor (Idgf)-like protein, a superfamily that diverged from chitinase-like proteins. (D) The Lh VLP venom allergen-like (CDD domain cd05380, E = 1.95 e−42) protein is aligned with five similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 37 – 42% identity; 6 e−41<= E <= 6 e−34) from other insects, including the red imported fire ant, the Panamanian leafcutter ant, and three parasitoid wasps (Jewel, a Braconid wasp, and a Chalcidoid egg parasite). A eukaryotic-specific SCP domain, best characterized in plant pathogenesis defense proteins, has been identified, as well as a putative secretion signal. (E) The Lh VLP Bap31-like (CDD domain cd05380, E = 1.95 e−42) protein is aligned with five similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 59 – 76% identity; 1 e−126 <= E <= 4 e−83) from other insects, including two species of ant (Florida carpenter and red imported fire ant), wasp (a Braconid and the Jewel parasitoid), and Drosophila mojavensis. Canonical Bap31 proteins regulate ER-stress-mediated apoptosis. Similar to these proteins, the Lh VLP protein is predicted to encode three transmembrane helices. (F) The Lh VLP knottin-like (pfam11410 domain, E = 5.19 e−03) protein is aligned with five similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 33 – 52% identity; 3 e−08 <= E <= 2 e−02), four from insect species and one from the eudicotyledon, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. Among the most similar putative homologs are sequences from diverse insects: Hymenoptera (sawfly and wasp), Diptera, and Hemipteran species. The sequence contains a putative secretion signal motif and three predicted disulfide bridges. 40% of the VLP sequence shows notable conservation (54% identity) when compared to a secreted ion channel toxin from the spider Chilobrachys guangxiensis (Arachnida: Theraphosidae). Knottins are classified as a cystine-rich plant antimicrobial peptide family. (G) The Lh VLP hemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP)-like (pfam06585 domain, E = 6.10 e−17) protein is aligned with four similar sequences (BLASTp nr, 24 – 30% identity; 1 e−11 <= E <= 6 e−03) from a wheat stem sawfly, the Panamanian leafcutter ant, the diamondback moth, and Drosophila melanogaster. No high identity homologs were found, but moderately similar homologs were found encoded by wasps, ants, and arthropods, in general. Homologs in Drosophila spp. were found, but are not functionally well characterized. The regions of similarities are within 80 to 90% of the length of the VLP protein sequence, but largely only in comparisons to putative homologs from other hymenoptera. MS899633-supplement-4.pdf (13.5MB, pdf) 5Data S2: Lh VLP GTPase alignments (Related to Figs 2, 3A, & 4A – C) This document provides alignments of select small and large VLP GTPases (including SmGTPases01/LgGTPases01) with putative homologs/paralogs from (A) Lh; (B) prokaryotic and eukaryotic species; (C) Ganaspis sp.1 (G1); and (D, E) Leptopilina clavipes (Lc). The far N-and C-termini show the most variation among the sequences and were trimmed. The residue range displayed is indicated after the species of origin. The coloring scheme is according to physiochemical properties. ORF = open reading frame. (A) Eight Lh VLP GTPases are presented here. Additional putative GTPase family members exist, but are not presented here. The first three sequences of ~ 300 residues, are SmGTPases, while the following five sequences of ~ 500 residues are LgGTPases. Among the eight family members shown here, the percent similarities within the N-terminal regions range from ~ 25 to 60% and average pairwise similarity over their full lengths is 45%. Only seven insertion/deletion sites exist in this 222 amino acid alignment and large blocks of identity (> 80% of the alignment length) are present. Highly similar secretion signal peptides are predicted at the N-termini of all GTPases (not shown). (B) The five most-similar ORFs found in the  TSA transcriptome for G1 (GAIW00000000.1) are shown aligned with Lh VLP Sm/LgGTPase01s. Like the Lh VLP GTPases, several putative G1 GTPases have predicted secretion signal peptides (not shown). Potential G1 homologs demonstrate >= 31% and 35% identity (E <= 3e−03 and 4e−59) to Lh VLP SmGTPase01 and LgGTPase01, respectively (given 75% alignment coverage). (C) The five most-similar ORFs found in the  TSA transcriptome for Lc (GAXY00000000.2) are shown aligned with Lh VLP Sm/LgGTPase01s. Similar to Lh and G1 GTPases, multiple Lc GTPases have predicted signal sequence peptides. The Lc transcripts identified show similarity in the N-terminal G domain, but are generally much shorter than the Lh VLP GTPases. Lh VLP SmGTPase01 shows <= 34% identity to Lc transcripts (>= 75% alignment criterion, E >= 2e−34) and LgGTPase01 shows <= 44% identity (E >= 3e−99), respectively. Lc also parasitizes Drosophila spp., but its comparative virulence and phylogenetic distance are poorly characterized in comparison to Lh and Lb. (D) The most similar Lh and Lc sequences have been extracted from (C) and are shown here.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study reports on a putative eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and challenges the currently held view that mechanistic routes to synthesize eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipids do not exist in insects, since to date, putative fly homologs of most mammalian enzymes have not been identified. Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques identified candidate Drosophila enzymes that share low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty Drosophila candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural models for these 20 top-scoring Drosophila candidates revealed a surprising degree of conservation in their overall folds and potential analogs for functional residues in all 20 enzymes. Although we were unable to identify any suitable candidate for lipoxygenase enzymes, we report structural homology models of three fly cyclooxygenases. Our findings predict that the D. melanogaster genome likely codes for one or more pathways for eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis. Our study suggests that classical and/or novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in insects–predictions that can be tested with the power of Drosophila genetics. Such experimental analysis of eicosanoid biology in a simple model organism will have high relevance to human development and health.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The eicosanoids are a family of biologically active lipids that have been implicated in various signaling pathways, with a central role in mammalian immunity and inflammation [1–3]. The canonical eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway begins with the release of fatty acids, primarily arachidonic acid (AA), from membrane phospholipids when phospholipase A2 is activated [4,5]. The canonical pathway then diverges, depending on whether the fatty acid substrate is processed by a cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), or a P450 epoxygenase (P450E). The COX enzymes generate prostanoids (prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes), resolvins, and electrophilic oxo-derivatives (EFOX) of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [6–8] whereas the LOX enzymes produce the leukotrienes, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and lipoxins [9]. There is some cross-talk between the COX and LOX pathways, as both are known to produce hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) [10,11]. The P450 epoxygenase pathway yields epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) [12]. These downstream products regulate diverse signaling pathways and biological processes [2,3,12–14] The COX and LOX branches of the eicosanoid pathway are well-characterized in humans. The COX enzymes (prostaglandin G/H synthases) are encoded by COX-1 (PTGS1) and COX-2 (PTGS2) [6]. COX-1 is constitutively expressed at low levels by most cells. In contrast, COX-2 is upregulated at sites of inflammation and during tumor progression [6,15]. COX-1 and COX-2 are membrane-associated heme-containing homodimers that catalyze the conversion of an 18–22 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA, typically AA, an ω-6, 20-carbon fatty acid) into prostaglandins G2 and H2[16]. Although AA is the preferred substrate, the COX enzymes are known to oxygenate eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3), linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DHLA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), with varying efficiencies [16–18]. This initial substrate choice is significant, as it determines whether the downstream prostanoid will tend to be pro- or anti-inflammatory. Fatty acids with two double bonds (e.g., AA) are converted into series-2 prostanoids (e.g., PGH2, PGE2), which are associated with pro-inflammatory signaling. In contrast, fatty acid substrates with three or four double bonds (e.g., EPA, DHLA, respectively) yield series-1 and 3 prostanoids (PGH1, PGE3), which are associated with anti-inflammatory signaling. Some COX products, such as the anti-inflammatory resolvins are synthesized only from EPA and DHA, whereas the pro- and anti-inflammatory 9- and 13-HODEs are generated from LA by COX enzymes [8,10]. Nevertheless, AA is the primary substrate for COX enzymes and so COX signaling tends to be pro-inflammatory. As a result, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which inhibit COX-1/2’s ability to generate pro-inflammatory products, are particularly important. PGH2 is subsequently converted to a variety of downstream eicosanoids, including PGD2, PGE2, PGF1α PGF2α, PGI2 (prostacyclin), and the thromboxanes TXA2 and TXB2. The downstream processing route depends on the availability of enzymes in a given cell type. For example, endothelial cells primarily produce PGI2, whereas platelets mainly produce TXA2 [19]. The LOX pathway operates independently from the COX pathway, diverging at the initial fatty acid processing stage. In humans, LOX enzymes are encoded by several genes (ALOX5, ALOX12, ALOX12B, ALOX15). Mammalian LOX enzymes catalyze the stereospecific dehydrogenation and dioxygenation of a PUFA, such as AA or LA, leading to the formation of a hydroxyperoxide containing a 1-hydroxyperoxy-2-trans-4-cis-pentadiene fragment [13,20]. The mammalian LOXs have been named according to the position of the carbon at which the oxygen molecule is inserted into AA, the primary fatty acid substrate, e.g., as 5-, 12-, or 15-LOX) [21]. The primary products are 5S-, 12S-, or 15S-HPETE, which can be further reduced by glutathione peroxidase to hydroxy forms (5-, 12-, 15-HETE), respectively [20,21]. 5-LOX is the only LOX that produces leukotrienes, and it is notable that catalytic activity requires the presence of a second protein (ALOX5AP), though the precise function of Five-Lipoxygenase Activating Protein (FLAP) is not known [20,22]. Following conversion of a fatty acid into 5-HPETE, downstream processing results in the terminal leukotrienes LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. The leukotrienes are clinically significant, as they are implicated in the allergic response and maintenance of chronic inflammation. 15-LOX (and to a lesser extent 5-LOX) produce the lipoxins LXA and LXB [23]. CYP450Es convert fatty acid substrates (e.g., AA) into four EET isomers, 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs, which function as autocrine and paracrine mediators. CYP450Es also convert EPA into epoxy-derivatives, and endocannabinoids containing 11,12- and 14,15-EETs [12]. The CYP450E protein is not examined in this study. The COX family enzymes are highly conserved across the animal kingdom, with orthologs found in the primitive marine corals as well as the higher vertebrates [24]. Traditional genomic analyses have failed to identify COX orthologs in the known genomes of insects, unicellular organisms, or plants, although prostaglandins, their primary products, have been found in some of these organisms [25–28]. Recent studies have suggested that an insect cyclooxygenase may exist in orthologs of the Drosophila gene Pxt [27,29,30]. LOX enzymes display an even broader degree of conservation, with orthologs found across the animal kingdom and in a variety of plants [9]. Sequence and biochemical analyses have failed to identify any insect LOX orthologs, with the exception of LOX activity in the primitive insect, Thermobia domestica [31] and one report in D. melanogaster [28]. Thus, there is conflicting information regarding the existence of functional COX or LOX pathway in insects. Given the complexity and biomedical importance of eicosanoid biology, defining the COX and LOX pathways in a model organism is a research priority. Identification of a functionally conserved COX or LOX pathway in D. melanogaster opens up exciting research avenues for understanding the genetic basis of eicosanoid-mediated inflammation in this well-established and simple model organism. To this end, we conducted a thorough computational analysis of the genome of D. melanogaster. While an initial BLAST search revealed candidates for the most conserved enzymes, it failed to identify likely orthologs for some of these enzymes. A more rigorous approach using iterative sequence searches combined with structural modeling revealed a surprising degree of similarity between mammalian and fly enzymes and the apparent conservation of functionally important residues even in these most distant candidate enzymes. Although we could not identify any suitable candidates for lipoxygenase enzymes, other component enzymes of the LOX branch of the pathway were identified. This suggests the possibility that eicosanoid pathway may adopt a non-canonical form in D. melanogaster and insects in general. Our study challenges the current view that insects lack a functional eicosanoid pathway and opens up tremendous possibilities of utilizing a well-established model organism for eicosanoid research.",

    "results": "Results Identification and characterization of candidate eicosanoid synthesis enzymes in D. melanogaster A purely sequence-based analysis of the D. melanogaster genome (Release 6.04, February 24th, 2015) using traditional sequence analysis tools (e.g., BLASTP) failed to identify potential orthologs for some of the human eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. However, using a more sensitive approach based on iterative HMMER searches, we uncovered potential D. melanogaster candidates that may function as eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. A majority of these candidates were shown to adopt a highly similar tertiary structure with the human target enzymes. Template based modeling approaches produce models that are structurally similar to the templates used, so the modeled enzymes were validated using evaluation techniques that confirm that the primary sequence is compatible with its modeled three dimensional structure. To rule out potential false positives, the structure was evaluated carefully for conservation of the necessary catalytic residues in a structural context as well. A summary of our findings is provided in Table 1. Group 1: The high scoring matches Eight putative orthologs identified in this search have particularly high confidence matches: CG1742, CG4086, CG6084, CG10602, CG6461, CG6154, CG12013 and CG18585. These proteins share at least 30% sequence identity with the human enzyme, possess the same overall fold, and display conservation of one or more key functional residue needed for activity. The first gene in this set, CG1742 (Microsomal glutathione S-transferase (MGST) -like, isoform A, NP_524696.1), encodes a protein of 152 residues and is predicted to have a single domain, Membrane Associated Proteins in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism (MAPEG, Pfam ID: PF01124) spanning residues18 to 148 amino. This gene has also been identified in a bioinformatics screen for MAPEG family member [65]. This protein displays 36% identity and 54% similarity to the sequence of human prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES, NP_004869.1). The human PTGES (PS-1) is an integral membrane protein that operates as a homotrimer and is known to catalyze the oxidoreduction of prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [66]. PTGES is characterized by the presence of a single MAPEG domain, which spans the region 16–146. PTGES (e.g., PDB ID: 4AL0; [67]) and is characteristic of several proteins belonging to the MAPEG family which includes MSGT and PTGES proteins [68]. This sequence is annotated as “MSGT-like” but the predicted structure of CG1742 is nearly identical and displays an RMSD 1.15 Å over 152 residues when superimposed with PTGES. PTGES, earlier referred to as MGST1-L1[69] is a glutathione-binding protein, and residues R38, R70, E77, R110, Y117, R126, and Y130 of human PTGES are associated with enzymatic activity as well as binding to glutathione [66,70]. Structural superposition reveals that CG1742 has a fully conserved set of these key functional residues, (R40, R71, E78, R111, Y118, R128, and F132). With respect to the last residue, a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution is likely to be functionally equivalent as phenylalanine and tyrosine have side chains with a single aromatic ring of similar volume. Phenylalanine differs only in that it lacks the hydroxyl group in the ortho position on the benzene ring. Since previous studies suggest that the aromatic ring of Y130 is likely important for PGH2-binding, an analog for this structural element is provided by F132 [70]. Details of modeled fly candidate PTGES and its comparison with human PTGES are provided in S1 Fig and a similar format is followed for all the candidate orthologs identified. The second gene in this set, CG4086 (Suppressor of ref(2)P sterility (Su(P)), NP_524116.2) encodes a 417 residue protein. CG4086 displays 42% identity and 62% similarity to the sequence of human prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PTGES2, NP_079348.1). PTGES2 is membrane-associated, as opposed to PTGES which is an integral membrane protein, though both catalyze the same reaction [71]. Despite the functional similarities, PTGES2 possesses a substantially different domain architecture and tertiary structure. The human PTGES2 possesses a GST-N3 domain (Pfam ID: PF13417) spanning amino acids 104–175 and a GST-C3 (Pfam ID: PF14497) domain spanning amino acids 201–368. CG4086 shares a highly similar domain architecture with the same domains spanning amino acids 125–184 and 248–396 respectively. PTGES2’s catalytic activity requires an essential residue, C110 [72]. The crystal structure of truncated PTGES2 has been published (PDB ID: 1Z9H; [73]), with the N-terminal membrane-associated region omitted (residues 1 to 99). Superposition of this truncated structure against the predicted structure of CG4086 reveals an RMSD of 0.814 Å over 377 residues. CG4086’s C133 overlaps with PTGES2’s C110, suggesting a match for this catalytic residue (S2 Fig). The third gene in this set, CG6084, encodes a 316 amino acid protein that is a high confidence match for the human Alcohol dehydrogenase NADP(+) (AKR1B1”, NP_001619.1). This enzyme, along with enzymes encoded by the related genes in this family (e.g., AKR1B15 and AKR1C3), catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. In particular, AKR1B1 and AKR1B15 are known to function as prostacyclin F synthases, converting prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) [74,75]. CG6084 and AKR1B1 share identical domain architectures [a single aldo/keto reductase family (Pfam ID: PF00248) domain], as well as 49% identity and 68% similarity at the level of primary structure. Three residues required for AKR1B1’s catalytic activity are Y48, K77 and H110 [76,77]. CG6084 possesses analogs for this triad of residues in the form of Y50, K79 and H112. In addition, the structural overlap of the predicted structure for CG6084 and human AKR1A1 (PDB ID: 2ALR; [78]) displays an RMSD of 0.847 Å over 316 residues (S3 Fig). The fourth gene in this set, CG10602 encodes a protein with 613 residues that displays 44% identity and 62% similarity to human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H, NP_000886.1). LTA4H is an epoxide hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the epoxide LTA4 to the diol, LTB4. This catalytic activity requires the presence of a zinc ion, which is coordinated by the catalytic triad of H296, H300 and E319. Residues E297, D376 and Y384 are also reportedly essential for efficient catalysis [79]. LTA4H’s domain architecture consists of Peptidase family M1 (Pfam ID: PF01433) spanning 13–387 and a Leukotriene A4 hydrolase, C-terminal domain (Pfam ID: PF09127) spanning amino acids 464–608. CG10602 shares an identical domain organization as well as the critical residues at H293, H297, E316 (the zinc triad) and E294, D374 and Y382. The tertiary structure similarity is readily apparent, as evidenced by a superposition of human LTA4H (PDB ID: 3B7U; [80]) and the predicted structure of CG10602, which results in an RMSD of 0.891 Å over 611 residues (S4 Fig). The fifth gene in this set, CG6461, encodes a 579 residue protein (Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, NP_573303.1) that shares 45% identity and 58% similarity to human Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase 1 (GGT1, NP_001275762.1). GGT1 cleaves the gamma-glutamyl bond of extracellular glutathione (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly), glutathione conjugates, and other gamma-glutamyl compounds. With respect to eicosanoid synthesis, GGT1 catalyzes the conversion of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) to leukotriene D4 (LTD4). GGT1 operates as a heterodimer consisting of small and large subunits which are produced from the same precursor that undergoes autocatalytic cleavage to produce the mature form of the enzyme. The only reported catalytic residue is T381, which corresponds to T382 in CG6461. GGT1 residues R107, T399 and E420 are believed to play a role in glutamate binding [81]. CG6461 possesses putative analogs for each of these residues, namely R107, T400 and E421, respectively. CG6461 and GGT1 also share identical domain architecture, with Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (Pfam ID: PF01019) domains spanning the majority of each protein. Superimposed, the human structure (PDB ID: 4GDX; [82]) and CG6461’s predicted structure displays an RMSD of 1.126 Å over 569 residues (S5 Fig). The sixth gene in this set, CG6154 (“DPEP,” NP_733146.2), encodes a 434 residue metallopeptidase that shares 49% identity and 65% similarity with human Dipeptidase, renal (DPEP1, NP_004404.1). Both enzymes contain a single Membrane dipeptidase (Pfam ID: PF01244) domain spanning the majority of the protein. DPEP1 is known to regulate leukotriene activity by catalyzing the conversion of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) to leukotriene E4 (LTE4) using zinc as a cofactor. To that end, the residues H36, D38, E141, H214 and H235 are reported to be essential for coordinating the zinc ions required for catalysis [83]. Aligned against CG6154, these residues correspond to H71, D73, E184, H257 and H278. This high degree of similarity extends to the tertiary structure, as the superimposed structure of human DPEP1 (PDB ID: 1ITQ; [83]) and the predicted structure of CG6154 display an RMSD of 0.523 Å over 411 residues (S6 Fig). The seventh gene in this set, CG12013 (“glutathione peroxidase,” NP_728870.1), encodes a 169 residue selenoprotein that is 35% identical and 52% similar to human glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1, NP_000572.2) and both contain a single glutathione peroxidase domain (Pfam ID: PF00255). As part of the eicosanoid pathway, GPX-1 converts the 12(S)-HpETE produced by lipoxygenase-12 (12-LOX) into 12(S)-HETE [84]. GPX1 requires a selenocysteine residue (U49) for catalysis [85]. CG12013’s amino acid sequence indicates that a cysteine residue is present at the corresponding position in this enzyme. However, this residue may in fact be a selenocysteine, as this substitution is unlikely to be detected by sequencing alone. Similarly, the tryptophan and glutamine residue that complete the catalytic triad are also conserved. A structural alignment of human GPX1 (PDB ID: 2F8A; unpublished, Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC)) and the predicted structure of CG12013 reveals an RMSD of 0.699 Å over 169 residues (S7 Fig). The eighth and final gene in this set, CG18585 (Carboxypeptidase A (CPA), NP_609132.1) encodes a 422 amino acid protein that is 35% identical and 55% similar to human Carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1, NP_001859.1). CPA1 is a metallocarboxypeptidase that requires a zinc atom as a cofactor for catalysis. CPA1 has been shown to convert the potent leukotriene C4 (LTC4) to the less potent leukotriene F4 (LTF4) by hydrolysis of an amide bond, suggesting that CPA1 serves to reduce inflammation [86]. The residues H179, E182, H306 and E380 are required for catalysis and coordinating zinc. These residues correspond to H178, E181, H305 and E382 in CPA. Aligned, the structure of human CPA1 (PDB ID: 3FJU; [87]) and the predicted structure of CG18585 display an RMSD of 0.753 Å over 419 residues (S8 Fig).Group 2: The midrange candidates Five candidates were identified in the search based on approaches focused more on structural similarity than underlying sequence conservation. Members of this set share at least 20% sequence identity with the human target but share similarity at the fold level and possess at least a partial set of conserved functional residue. The first gene in this set, CG8938 (GST-S1, NP_725653.1) encodes a 249 residue glutathione-S-transferase enzyme, which displays 36% identity and 60% similarity to human Hematopoietic Prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS, NP_055300.1). HPGDS, alternatively known as Prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase, is a glutathione-requiring prostaglandin D synthase. HPGDS operates as a homodimer, which can optionally be activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+ to increase catalytic efficiency to 150% of the basal level. Coordination of the metallic ion ligands is coordinated by D93, D96 and D97 [88]. CG8938 and GST-S1 share an identical domain architecture, with an N-terminal GST-N domain (Pfam ID: PF02798) and a C-terminal GST-C domain (Pfam ID: PF00043). Similarly, CG8938 possesses matches for two of the three aspartic residues required for enhanced catalytic activity, at positions D139 and D143 (corresponding to D93 and D97 in HPGDS). At the corresponding position aligned to D96, CG8938 instead has an asparagine (N142). However, mutagenesis studies by Inouie et al. have shown that a D to N substitution at this same position in HPGDS actually increases PGD2 synthesis [88]. In addition to this sequence-based evidence, superposition of the predicted CG8938 structure and human HPGDS (PDB ID: 1IYI; [88]) reveals an RMSD of 1.045 Å over 160 residues (S9 Fig). The second gene in this set, CG16817 (NP_649925.1) encodes a 184 residue protein, which displays 27% identity and 45% similarity to human Prostaglandin E synthase 3 (PTGES3, NP_006592.3). In contrast to PTGES1 and PTGES2 discussed above, PTGES3 is a cytosolic protein. However, all three enzymes share the same catalytic function, i.e., oxidoreduction of prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [89]. PTGES3 and CG16817 share an identical domain architecture, with the bipartite CHORD-containing proteins and SGT1 (CS) Domain (Pfam ID: PF04969) spanning the N-terminus to the middle of the protein. The C-terminal region of PTGES3 is notable for showing a compositional bias towards aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues in the range spanning 108 to 160. Currently, only one crystal structure for PTGES3 has been published (PDB ID: 1EJF; [90]) and this structure is limited to a truncated version of the protein spanning residue 1 to 110, i.e., the acidic C-terminal region has not been crystalized. An alignment of PTGES3 and CG16817 shows that CG16817 also displays a compositional bias towards acidic residues at its C-terminus, though it is unclear what role this bias serves in either protein. We were unable to generate a full-length model of CG16817 due to a lack of any suitable template structure for the C-terminal acidic region. However, the truncated CG16817 model (residues 1 to 113) shows an RMSD of 0.823 Å compared to PTGES3 over 160 residues (S10 Fig). The third gene in this set, CG11200 (Carbonyl reductase (CBR), NP_611471.1) encodes a 355 residue protein that displays 30% identity and 45% similarity to human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1, NP_001748.1). CBR1 is a NADPH-dependent reductase with broad substrate specificity, e.g., it can convert PGE2 to PGF2α. It has been reported that CBR1 binds to NADP via N90 and that Y194 serves as a proton acceptor for the reaction [91]. A corresponding match for both of these residues can be found in CG11200 at positions N154 and Y233. An alignment of human CBR1 (PDB ID: 3BHJ; [92]) against the predicted model for CG11200 shows an RMSD of 1.153 Å over 277 residues (S11 Fig). The fourth gene in this set, CG18814 (NP_652673.2), encodes a 267 amino acid protein that displays 34% identity and 53% similarity to human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase NAD(+)(HPGD, NP_000851.2). HPGD catalyzes the conversion of the 15-hydroxyl group of prostaglandins into a keto group, which strongly reduces the biologic activity of these molecules. As a result, HPGD is considered the primary enzyme responsible for degradation of prostaglandins. It has been reported that N91, S138, Q148 and Y151 are required for catalysis [93]. CG18814 residues N89, S137 and Y150 of CG18814 align with these catalytic residues and are oriented at overlapping or directly adjacent positions in close proximity in the structural alignment of the CG18814 model against the structure of HPGD. CG18814 lacks an obvious analog for Q148, which is located in a flexible loop region. However, CG18814 possesses a structurally-aligned loop region which contains Q142. Q148 and Q142 are located within approximately 5Å of each other and oriented similarly in a static superposition of the predicted model and crystal structure and may be functionally analogous. Moreover, both proteins have an identical domain architecture, with a short-chain dehydrogenase domain (Pfam ID: PF00106) spanning from the N-terminus to approximately residue 180. Superposition of human HPGD (PDB ID: 2GDZ; [93]) and the predicted structure of CG18814 reveals an RMSD of 0.715 Å over 266 residues (S12 Fig). The fifth and final gene in this set, CG3616 (CYP450-9c1, NP_523850.1) encodes a cytochrome P450 oxidase, which displays 31% identity and 49% similarity to human Thromboxane A synthase (TBXAS1, NP_001052.2). TBXAS1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where it catalyzes the conversion of PGH2 to thromboxane A2 (TBA2) [94]. TBXAS1 is categorized as a cytochrome p450 family (CYP450) enzyme based on sequence similarity. This categorization is illustrated by the fact that the only domain identified in TBXAS1 is a Cytochrome P450 domain (Pfam ID: PF00067) spanning most of the protein. CYP450 enzymes are highly conserved in eukaryotes, where they catalyze reactions in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids [95]. However, this ubiquitous nature of CYP450 enzymes makes it difficult to identify potential orthologs for any one specific enzyme within the family. CG3616 was selected as a candidate from the set of eight fly candidates with similar sequences after taking into account the initial sequence comparison, the transmembrane helix pattern (calculated using TOPCONS [96]), and the alignment score against a multiple sequence alignment of known or high confidence TBXAS1 orthologs. A structural superposition of a modeled human TBXAS1 (no structure available) with the predicted model of CG3616 showed an RMSD of 0.699 Å over 518 residues (S13 Fig).Group 3: The most distant candidates Many of the putative orthologs identified in D. melanogaster, although divergent in sequence from the human target, are similar enough that traditional methods for analyzing and aligning sequences can be utilized. However, we identified 6 sequences that could not be detected by or showed low sequence identity and/or low query coverage using traditional sequence alignment algorithms such as BLASTP and therefore, required more intensive analysis. The search for a cyclooxygenase ortholog proved to be one of these difficult cases. As noted above, it is widely accepted that D. melanogaster lacks a cyclooxygenase ortholog. However, there have been sporadic reports of prostaglandin detected in D. melanogaster extracts over the years [27]. The human genome encodes three major cyclooxygenase isozymes via two loci. PTGS1 encodes COX-1 (a constitutive cyclooxygenase), whereas PTGS2 encodes COX-2 (which is inducible and expressed in a tissue-specific manner). A truncated and poorly characterized isoform of PTGS1, COX-3 is also expressed in certain cells, and reportedly demonstrates reduced prostaglandin synthesis activity relative to COX-1 [97]. COX-1 and COX-2 operate as homodimers and are characterized by two domains: An N-terminal EGF-like domain (Pfam ID: IPR000742) and an animal heme peroxidase domain (Pfam ID: PF03098). The former allows for association with the cell and nuclear membrane while the latter is responsible for the cyclooxygenase activity. The COX enzymes initiate the prostaglandin synthesis pathway by converting arachidonic acid, or other polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) substrates, into the unstable intermediate PGG2 followed by PGH2. During this process, it has been reported that a small amount of the PUFA substrate is converted into a racemic mixture of 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acids (i.e., 15-HETEs), which may be processed into lipoxins, a poorly understood class of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. The COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes contain two active sites: a heme with peroxidase activity, responsible for the reduction of PGG2 to PGH2, and a cyclooxygenase site, where arachidonic acid is converted into the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) [6]. Extensive studies have been performed on the sheep ortholog of COX-1(NP_001009476.1; PDB ID: 1CQE), which is a proxy for the human orthologs [98]. These studies reveal that cyclooxygenase activity is mediated by Y385, which forms a radical capable of abstracting a hydrogen from the PUFA substrate (e.g., carbon-13 of arachidonic acid). H207 and H388 are also required for the dual peroxidase and cyclooxygenase functions of these enzymes [99,100]. Other functional residues identified in the literature include R120, Q203, V349, and S530 [101]. R120 interacts with C-1 of the PUFA substrate, arachidonic acid [102]. Q203 is conserved among mammalian COX enzymes, though the function of this residue is currently unknown. V349 is believed to play a role in substrate specificity; mammalian COX enzymes share this residue and show a substrate preference for arachidonic acid, while invertebrate COX enzymes that have a leucine at this position display specificity for linoleic acid [103] and S530 acetylation is the basis for COX-2 inhibition by aspirin [99]. Although an initial screen of D. melanogaster using BLASTP reported similar sequences with local matches, further investigation was needed to confirm if these candidates possessed the requisite features of a COX enzyme. Iterative HMMER searches confirmed four potential candidates: CG4009 (NP_650588.2), CG6969 (Cardinal, NP_651081.1), CG7660 (Pxt, NP_650648.3) and CG3477 (Pxd, NP_996223.1). Each of these candidates was added to a previously generated multiple sequence alignment containing PTGS1 and known or high confidence predicted orthologs using MAFFT as illustrated for CG4009 in Fig 2. The presence or absence of functional residues at or near aligned positions was noted. Similarly, the candidates were analyzed to determine the secondary structure and domain architecture of each protein. Following this filtering step, only three proteins remained as viable candidates for further study: CG4009, CG6969, and CG7660. CG7660 has been shown to demonstrate COX-like activity that plays an important role in Drosophila reproduction [29]. All three candidates appear to have the requisite catalytic triad and share a similar domain architecture, though they each lack the N-terminal EGF-like domain. Putative analogs for the H206, Y384 and H387 catalytic triad appear to be present on CG4009 at H163, Y399, H401 and on CG7660 at H222, Y564, H568, respectively. Fig 2. A multiple sequence alignment of the D. melanogaster candidate CG4009 with human PTGS1 and known or high confidence predicted orthologs. Open in a new tab Red asterisks below the MSA denotes conserved key catalytic residues. The green asterisk marks the putative analog for the tyrosine. The blue asterisk denotes an insertion of 42 residues in CG4009 and reads X in the alignment.Structural models of CG4009, CG6969, and CG7660 were built and validated as described above. PTGS1 (PDB ID: 3N8V; [104]) and the predicted structure for CG4009 both display a cyclooxygenase fold, and the predicted catalytic domains are superimposable with an RMSD of 2.660 Å over 599 residues (S14 Fig). CG7660 and CG6969 each display a similar tertiary structure and with predicted catalytic domains that overlap with PTGS1 with an RMSD of 2.810 and 2.942 Å, respectively. The predicted structures differ from PTGS1 at their N-termini, which is expected given the absence of the EGF-like domain, though the CG4009 structure is marginally closer. However, these three structures present the necessary catalytic residues in a similar orientation as in PTGS1 and so likely possess cyclooxygenase activity. The search for a potential ortholog for PTGDS also proved to be difficult. PTGDS is a second prostaglandin-D-synthase, which operates in conjunction with the isozyme HPGDS (discussed previously). BLAST-based searching failed to identify any D. melanogaster candidates for the human enzyme (NP_000945.3). However, iterative HMMER searches suggested CG33126 (Neural Lazarillo (NLaz), NP_787960.1) merits further scrutiny despite having only 12% identity and 31% similarity to PTGDS based on a structure based sequence alignment. Both proteins share similar domain architecture, namely a Lipocalin domain (Pfam ID: PF00061), which is known to take the form of a beta barrel structure. Structural superposition revealed that human PTGDS (PDB ID: 5WY9; unpublished) and the CG33126 model overlap with an RMSD of 2.084 Å over 190 residues and that CG33126 has an aligned match for PTGDS’s catalytic cysteine (C65) at position C67 [105]. CG33126 contains an N-terminal alpha helix that is absent from PTGDS, however this helix is predicted to be a signal peptide. PTGDS contains a similar N-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved during processing i.e., omitted from the 5WY9 crystal structure (S15 Fig). Prostacyclin synthase (PTGIS) is another enzyme that does not have a clear ortholog in D. melanogaster. PTGIS catalyzes the isomerization of PGH2 to prostacyclin, the only prostaglandin with a bicyclic ring structure [106]. PTGIS encodes a 500 amino acid enzyme characterized by a cytochrome p450 family domain ranging from position 30 to 494. The N-terminus is predicted to contain a 200 amino acid signal sequence. BLAST and iterative HMMER searches reveal multiple high-scoring full length matches among the various CYP450 enzymes encoded in the D. melanogaster genome. However, CG3466 (CYP450-4d2, NP_525043.1) was identified as the top candidate based upon similarity of its secondary structure profile. CG3466 possesses an aligned match for PTGIS’s heme axial ligand (C441) at position C449. PTGIS (PDB ID: 2IAG; [107]) and the modeled CG3466 are superimposable with an RMSD of 1.213 Å over 500 residues, despite sharing only 14% identity and 30% similarity at the sequence level gauged from a structure based sequence alignment (S16 Fig). Leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), is a 150 amino acid enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of leukotriene A4 with reduced glutathione to form leukotriene C4. BLAST searches against D. melanogaster fail to identify an obvious ortholog. However, an iterative HMMER search identified the 165 amino acid protein CG33178 (NP_788904.1) as a potential candidate. The two proteins share full length identity of 18% and similarity of 31% discerned from a structure based sequence alignment and have an identical domain architecture in the form of a single MAPEG domain (Pfam ID: PF01124) spanning the bulk of the protein. Studies of the crystal structure of LTC4S (PDB ID: 2PNO; [108]) have revealed that it is an integral membrane protein composed of four transmembrane helices and that it functions as a homotrimer. The predicted model of CG33178 displays a similar fold, consisting of a bundle of four alpha helices, and it superimposes on 2PNO with an RMSD of 1.257 Å over 150 residues (S17 Fig). CG33178 also displays potential equivalents for each of LTC4S’s catalytically relevant residues (R30, R31 and R104) at positions R51, R53 and R139. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP, NP_001620.2), the final target protein in this set, is required for leukotriene synthesis by arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5). It has been reported that ALOX5AP functions by binding ALOX5 to the membrane and loading polyunsaturated fatty acid substrates (e.g., arachidonic acid) onto ALOX5 for conversion into leukotriene A4. Like LTC4S above, ALOX5AP is a MAPEG family protein that functions as a membrane-associated homotrimer. BLAST searches for a potential ortholog do not identify a clear match in D. melanogaster, though iterative HMMER searches reveal CG33177 and CG33178 as potential candidates. Both are MAPEG family proteins with highly similar sequences and predicted tertiary structures. CG33178 displays greater sequence similarity to LTC4S and analogs for the catalytically relevant residues and so was assigned as the top candidate for LTC4S. As a result, CG33177 was selected as the top candidate for a potential ortholog for ALOX5AP. The CG33177 structural model displays 13% identity and 28% similarity with human ALOX5A based on a structural overlap (PDB ID: 2Q7M; [109]) with an RMSD of 1.024 Å over 161 residues (S18 Fig).",
    "discussion": "Discussion A schematic of a putative D. melanogaster eicosanoid synthesis pathway based on our analysis is shown in Fig 3. Notably, the pathway appears to account for a full complement of prostaglandin synthesis enzymes. A functional thromboxane synthesis pathway may also be present, as potential orthologs for thromboxane A synthase have been identified. However, given the structural and sequence similarity of TBXA synthase to the numerous functionally unrelated cytochrome P450 oxidase in the D. melanogaster genome, speculation must be reserved pending experimental validation. Fig 3. A theoretical eicosanoid synthesis pathway in D. melanogaster. Open in a new tab A graphical overview of fly candidates in the putative pathway shown alongside the human enzymes as well as superposed with it. Boxed names represent the intermediates or end products (Red: Prostaglandins; Blue: Thromboxanes; Green: Leukotrienes; Yellow: HETEs). Enzymes for which orthologs could not be identified are represented by dashed ovals. The three candidate groups are marked next to the enzymes in a similar manner as Table 1: high-confidence (regular font; Group 1), mid-range (underlined; Group 2), and distant (italicized and bold font; Group 3). The existence of a leukotriene synthesis arm of the pathway could not be fully resolved since a thorough search of the D. melanogaster genome has failed to identify a potential lipoxygenase, which is critical for the initial processing of the PUFA substrate into leukotriene intermediates. Interestingly, potential orthologs exist for each of the downstream leukotriene processing enzymes. Based upon our current understanding of the mammalian pathway, a functional lipoxygenase is necessary for HETE intermediates and the corresponding final products (e.g., lipoxins and other non-canonical eicosanoids) [110]. Our data challenges that view that D. melanogaster lacks a functional eicosanoid synthesis pathway [110–112] and suggests that it may in fact possess potential orthologs for some or majority of the eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. These candidates may have thus far eluded detection because of high sequence divergence compared to the mammalian enzymes. However, the modeling results from our study, suggest that these candidates share the same overall fold and matches for the known or predicted catalytic residues. The prediction of eicosanoid synthesis enzymes may explain the in vivo effects of aspirin and prostaglandins in oogenesis [29] and possibly the existence of eicosanoid-like compounds in D. melanogaster [27,28,113]. Our results however raise many questions: (a) What are the exact roles of individual enzymes; do they catalyze the reactions their structures predict they should? (b) What are the intermediate and final end products of the pathway? (c) What are the principal physiological events these intermediate and final biosynthetic products control and how similar are the signaling mechanisms by which their effects are mediated in cells and tissues? The apparent absence of lipoxygenase may be explained in part by the multiple cyclooxygenase genes in the D. melanogaster genome where one of more of these may only or also possess lipoxygenase like activity. Dual function cyclooxygenases can generate prostaglandins and lipoxygenase products (e.g. HPETEs). For example, mammalian cyclooxygenases can produce limited amounts of 11- and 15-HPETE as a by-product in addition to PGH [114–116] and aspirin-acetylated COX-2 has been shown to produce 15R-HETEs [117]. Similar activity by one of the putative D. melanogaster COX orthologs could provide upstream processing needed for 11- and 15-HPETE, though this fails to provide the 5-HPETE intermediate needed for downstream leukotriene synthesis. Alternatively, 5-HETEs may be produced using an unconventional mechanism by the COX candidates or perhaps by an unidentified enzyme. The existence of structurally conserved downstream leukotriene synthesis enzymes suggests that the upstream intermediates are likely present in some form. Drosophila may possess a CYP450 enzyme capable of synthesizing 5-HETE; lipoxygenase-like CYP450s have been identified that produce 5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 12- and 20-HETEs [118,119]. Recent studies have reported on bacterial lipoxygenases which are highly divergent from animal and plant lipoxygenases, both in terms of overall sequence conservation and the presence of expected catalytic residues [120]. There is also a possibility that D. melanogaster and other insect expresses a functional 5-LOX that differs radically from the canonical profile of a lipoxygenase. The existence of a functional eicosanoid synthesis pathway requires both the presence of the requisite synthetic enzymes and suitable substrates. The mammalian eicosanoids are primarily derived from 20-carbon PUFAs (arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid), as well as from 18-carbon PUFAs (γ-linolenic acid, α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid). In the vertebrate pathway, the 18-carbon fatty acids linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid can be processed into the 20-carbon PUFAs arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, respectively, via a three-step process involving a Δ6 desaturase, an elongase, and, a Δ5 desaturase. These 20-carbon PUFAs are then capable of being processed by COX or LOX to generate the canonical eicosanoids. 18-carbon PUFAs (e.g., linoleic acid) may also be processed by 15-LOX into 9- and 13-HODEs, a subfamily of non-canonical eicosanoids. According to previous studies Drosophila appear to lack homologs for the mammalian Δ5 and Δ6 desaturases based upon sequence analyses, and so it should be unable to synthesize 20–22 carbon PUFAs from essential fatty acid precursors [112]. Furthermore, flies raised in the absence of 20-carbon PUFAs for several generations remain healthy, implying that 20-carbon PUFAs are non-essential [112]. Thus, it is generally accepted that Drosophila rely on PUFAs obtained from its vegetarian diet, which is generally limited to the essential 18-carbon fatty acids linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Based on the current understanding that D. melanogaster lacks Δ5 and Δ6 desaturase activity, it would be expected that the 18-carbon PUFAs obtained from its diet are processed into HODEs as opposed to eicosanoid derivatives of the 20-carbon PUFAs. Recent studies have validated this hypothesis, and confirmed the presence of 9- and 13-HODEs in D. melanogaster extracts (Govind lab, unpublished work); [121]. However, given the reports of prostaglandin-like molecules in D. melanogaster extracts, it is probable that additional lipid processing occurs to produce compounds similar to the canonical eicosanoids but the biosynthetic components have not been identified yet. Further computational and experimental work is needed to fully resolve these issues. Altogether, the present study suggests that D. melanogaster may possess a functional equivalent for the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis pathway. Our results highlight the need for customizing advanced prediction methods to identify orthologs, and to build structural models that predict the requisite biochemistry for function. These findings, combined with other recent biochemical studies, suggest the possibility that D. melanogaster likely utilizes eicosanoid signaling. However, further experimental studies will be needed to be address the exact role and physiological context of these biosynthetic enzymes. The importance of our study lies in opening up this powerful model organism for the study of eicosanoid signaling, in the context of inflammation as well as non-inflammation related physiology.",

Copyright notice ID: 6372189 PMID: 30753230 Abstract This study reports on a putative eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and challenges the currently held view that mechanistic routes to synthesize eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipids do not exist in insects, since to date, putative fly homologs of most mammalian enzymes have not been identified. Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques identified candidate Drosophila enzymes that share low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty Drosophila candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural models for these 20 top-scoring Drosophila candidates revealed a surprising degree of conservation in their overall folds and potential analogs for functional residues in all 20 enzymes. Although we were unable to identify any suitable candidate for lipoxygenase enzymes, we report structural homology models of three fly cyclooxygenases. Our findings predict that the D. melanogaster genome likely codes for one or more pathways for eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis. Our study suggests that classical and/or novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in insects–predictions that can be tested with the power of Drosophila genetics. Such experimental analysis of eicosanoid biology in a simple model organism will have high relevance to human development and health.Introduction The eicosanoids are a family of biologically active lipids that have been implicated in various signaling pathways, with a central role in mammalian immunity and inflammation [1–3]. The canonical eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway begins with the release of fatty acids, primarily arachidonic acid (AA), from membrane phospholipids when phospholipase A2 is activated [4,5]. The canonical pathway then diverges, depending on whether the fatty acid substrate is processed by a cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), or a P450 epoxygenase (P450E). The COX enzymes generate prostanoids (prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes), resolvins, and electrophilic oxo-derivatives (EFOX) of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [6–8] whereas the LOX enzymes produce the leukotrienes, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and lipoxins [9]. There is some cross-talk between the COX and LOX pathways, as both are known to produce hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) [10,11]. The P450 epoxygenase pathway yields epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) [12]. These downstream products regulate diverse signaling pathways and biological processes [2,3,12–14] The COX and LOX branches of the eicosanoid pathway are well-characterized in humans. The COX enzymes (prostaglandin G/H synthases) are encoded by COX-1 (PTGS1) and COX-2 (PTGS2) [6]. COX-1 is constitutively expressed at low levels by most cells. In contrast, COX-2 is upregulated at sites of inflammation and during tumor progression [6,15]. COX-1 and COX-2 are membrane-associated heme-containing homodimers that catalyze the conversion of an 18–22 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA, typically AA, an ω-6, 20-carbon fatty acid) into prostaglandins G2 and H2[16]. Although AA is the preferred substrate, the COX enzymes are known to oxygenate eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3), linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DHLA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), with varying efficiencies [16–18]. This initial substrate choice is significant, as it determines whether the downstream prostanoid will tend to be pro- or anti-inflammatory. Fatty acids with two double bonds (e.g., AA) are converted into series-2 prostanoids (e.g., PGH2, PGE2), which are associated with pro-inflammatory signaling. In contrast, fatty acid substrates with three or four double bonds (e.g., EPA, DHLA, respectively) yield series-1 and 3 prostanoids (PGH1, PGE3), which are associated with anti-inflammatory signaling. Some COX products, such as the anti-inflammatory resolvins are synthesized only from EPA and DHA, whereas the pro- and anti-inflammatory 9- and 13-HODEs are generated from LA by COX enzymes [8,10]. Nevertheless, AA is the primary substrate for COX enzymes and so COX signaling tends to be pro-inflammatory. As a result, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which inhibit COX-1/2’s ability to generate pro-inflammatory products, are particularly important. PGH2 is subsequently converted to a variety of downstream eicosanoids, including PGD2, PGE2, PGF1α PGF2α, PGI2 (prostacyclin), and the thromboxanes TXA2 and TXB2. The downstream processing route depends on the availability of enzymes in a given cell type. For example, endothelial cells primarily produce PGI2, whereas platelets mainly produce TXA2 [19]. The LOX pathway operates independently from the COX pathway, diverging at the initial fatty acid processing stage. In humans, LOX enzymes are encoded by several genes (ALOX5, ALOX12, ALOX12B, ALOX15). Mammalian LOX enzymes catalyze the stereospecific dehydrogenation and dioxygenation of a PUFA, such as AA or LA, leading to the formation of a hydroxyperoxide containing a 1-hydroxyperoxy-2-trans-4-cis-pentadiene fragment [13,20]. The mammalian LOXs have been named according to the position of the carbon at which the oxygen molecule is inserted into AA, the primary fatty acid substrate, e.g., as 5-, 12-, or 15-LOX) [21]. The primary products are 5S-, 12S-, or 15S-HPETE, which can be further reduced by glutathione peroxidase to hydroxy forms (5-, 12-, 15-HETE), respectively [20,21]. 5-LOX is the only LOX that produces leukotrienes, and it is notable that catalytic activity requires the presence of a second protein (ALOX5AP), though the precise function of Five-Lipoxygenase Activating Protein (FLAP) is not known [20,22]. Following conversion of a fatty acid into 5-HPETE, downstream processing results in the terminal leukotrienes LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. The leukotrienes are clinically significant, as they are implicated in the allergic response and maintenance of chronic inflammation. 15-LOX (and to a lesser extent 5-LOX) produce the lipoxins LXA and LXB [23]. CYP450Es convert fatty acid substrates (e.g., AA) into four EET isomers, 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs, which function as autocrine and paracrine mediators. CYP450Es also convert EPA into epoxy-derivatives, and endocannabinoids containing 11,12- and 14,15-EETs [12]. The CYP450E protein is not examined in this study. The COX family enzymes are highly conserved across the animal kingdom, with orthologs found in the primitive marine corals as well as the higher vertebrates [24]. Traditional genomic analyses have failed to identify COX orthologs in the known genomes of insects, unicellular organisms, or plants, although prostaglandins, their primary products, have been found in some of these organisms [25–28]. Recent studies have suggested that an insect cyclooxygenase may exist in orthologs of the Drosophila gene Pxt [27,29,30]. LOX enzymes display an even broader degree of conservation, with orthologs found across the animal kingdom and in a variety of plants [9]. Sequence and biochemical analyses have failed to identify any insect LOX orthologs, with the exception of LOX activity in the primitive insect, Thermobia domestica [31] and one report in D. melanogaster [28]. Thus, there is conflicting information regarding the existence of functional COX or LOX pathway in insects. Given the complexity and biomedical importance of eicosanoid biology, defining the COX and LOX pathways in a model organism is a research priority. Identification of a functionally conserved COX or LOX pathway in D. melanogaster opens up exciting research avenues for understanding the genetic basis of eicosanoid-mediated inflammation in this well-established and simple model organism. To this end, we conducted a thorough computational analysis of the genome of D. melanogaster. While an initial BLAST search revealed candidates for the most conserved enzymes, it failed to identify likely orthologs for some of these enzymes. A more rigorous approach using iterative sequence searches combined with structural modeling revealed a surprising degree of similarity between mammalian and fly enzymes and the apparent conservation of functionally important residues even in these most distant candidate enzymes. Although we could not identify any suitable candidates for lipoxygenase enzymes, other component enzymes of the LOX branch of the pathway were identified. This suggests the possibility that eicosanoid pathway may adopt a non-canonical form in D. melanogaster and insects in general. Our study challenges the current view that insects lack a functional eicosanoid pathway and opens up tremendous possibilities of utilizing a well-established model organism for eicosanoid research.Materials and methods A flowchart summarizing the general protocol of the present study with the various tools used to identify and characterize putative D. melanogaster orthologs for the classic eicosanoid synthesis enzymes discussed in detail below is shown in Fig 1. Fig 1. Summary of the workflow and tools used to carry out the present study. Open in a new tab A schematic of the workflow devised to identify, model, and characterize various orthologs of the human eicosanoid pathway.Identification and characterization of human eicosanoid synthesis enzymes A canonical eicosanoid synthesis pathway in humans was compiled from the  BioSystems Database using the Eicosanoid Synthesis (BSID: 198888) and Arachidonic Acid pathway maps (BSID: 829971) [32]. Protein sequence(s) for each human canonical pathway gene were obtained from the  RefSeq database [33]. Enzymes selected for this study are listed in Table 1 (see Results section). For each enzyme, either the sole protein product or the major isoform was selected as the representative sequence. Known and high-confidence predicted orthologs for each enzyme were identified using the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) Orthology database [34]. A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for each target enzyme with the selected orthologs was then generated using PROMALS3D, followed by manual editing [35]. Domains and active sites on each identified enzyme were annotated using the Pfam, InterPro, CDART, and Uniprot databases [36–38]. Consensus secondary structure profiles were generated using the PsiPred, JPred and PSSPred servers [39–41] to confirm identified functional domains and to ascertain domain boundaries. Table 1.

The candidates are denoted in the Annotation identifier column as high-confidence (regular font), mid-range (underlined), and distant (italicized and bold font). Gene annotation IDs (distinct from gene symbols) are represented in a common way: a species-specific 2 letter prefix followed by a four or five digit integer. CG is the 2-letter prefix for D. melanogaster for protein-coding genes. ¥The template 1M0U is the crystal structure for a fragment of this protein (position 48–249). The N-terminal region was built using MODELLER’s ab initio methods. Identification of potential eicosanoid synthesis enzymes in D. melanogaster We used several different sequence analysis algorithms to identify candidate Drosophila orthologs for each human enzyme. Specifically, each human enzyme reference sequence was queried against a subset of the D. melanogaster  non-redundant sequence database using PSI-BLAST, DELTA-BLAST or JACKHMMER [42–44]. For this, each human enzyme reference sequence was queried against a subset of the D. melanogaster  non-redundant sequence database. DELTA-BLAST is a more sensitive variant of the traditional BLAST algorithm that incorporates domain information from pre-constructed position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) in order to improve detection of homology [42]. JACKHMMER is an alternative sequence analysis and alignment tool that operates in an iterative fashion by generating a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) for a query protein, searching the target sequence database, and then updating the HMM to include sequences that score above a given cut-off value [44]. For this study, specialized BLAST and HMMer algorithms were leveraged as part of a combined approach to identify candidates which may be remote homologs for the human eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Each search was conducted with three iterations using the default parameters. D. melanogaster candidates with statistically significant full-length alignments to the query were selected after each round. These candidates were then analyzed using the same secondary structure and domain analysis tools as discussed above. Each candidate was then aligned against the previously generated MSA (containing the human enzyme and known/predicted orthologs) in order to screen out hits that lacked required functional residues and/or those with substantially dissimilar secondary structure or domain architecture. In silico modeling of D. melanogaster candidates Full-length three-dimensional models were generated for each top-scoring D. melanogaster candidate protein thus identified using the HHpred, MODELLER, LOMETS and I-TASSER software packages [45–48] HHpred performs sensitive searches to detect protein homology, function, and structure prediction based on HMM–HMM comparison and uses MODELLER to create the models. MODELLER, a homology modeling tool, predicts the tertiary structure of a protein based on satisfaction of spatial restraints derived from sequentially similar templates whose structure is known (i.e., a sequence-sequence comparison). In contrast, I-TASSER utilizes a multi-threading algorithm (i.e., a sequence-structure comparison) to identify suitable templates followed by an iterative template fragment assembly approach based on replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations to generate the full length model; unaligned primary sequence regions are built using ab initio methods. LOMETS is a meta-server that generates and ranks modeling results produced using several alternative threading algorithms which are executed in parallel. The accuracy of homology modeling depends largely on the target-template alignment, with ≥40% sequence identity generally yielding high quality models and 25% sequence identity being the lower threshold for an acceptable model [49]. However, threading based modeling tools are generally less sensitive to sequence identity differences and some packages (e.g., I-TASSER) are known to generate high quality models using templates sharing as little as 20–30% sequence identity with the target sequence [50,51]. Each D. melanogaster candidate sequence was searched against the Protein Data Bank database of published structures [52] using PSI-BLAST and JACKHMMER [43,44]. Potential templates with ≥30%, full-length sequence identity were aligned against the candidate using PROMALS3D, MAFFT, and T-Coffee [35,53,54] and evaluated. If a suitable single full-length template was not found, either due to a lack of coverage or low sequence identity within the aligned range, I-TASSER was used to generate a composite model based on several templates. In each case, the initial model was used to generate a refined full atomic model using ModRefiner, which also optimizes sidechain placement [55]. All of the refined models were then evaluated using the ProSa, ProQ2 and MODFOLD4 servers [56–58]. Loops and unstructured N- and C-terminal regions in these models were optimized using ab initio methods (e.g., MODELLER’s loop routines or QUARK), refined using ModRefiner and reevaluated as necessary [48,59]. Unsuitable models were rejected and rebuilt using alternatives templates according to the preceding protocol. Models were analyzed using the surface property tools in the Chimera and PyMol visualization and structural modeling packages, in addition to online tools including COFACTOR, and COACH [60–63]TM-Score was used to perform structural comparisons of the models with the known target human enzymes [64].Results Identification and characterization of candidate eicosanoid synthesis enzymes in D. melanogaster A purely sequence-based analysis of the D. melanogaster genome (Release 6.04, February 24th, 2015) using traditional sequence analysis tools (e.g., BLASTP) failed to identify potential orthologs for some of the human eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. However, using a more sensitive approach based on iterative HMMER searches, we uncovered potential D. melanogaster candidates that may function as eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. A majority of these candidates were shown to adopt a highly similar tertiary structure with the human target enzymes. Template based modeling approaches produce models that are structurally similar to the templates used, so the modeled enzymes were validated using evaluation techniques that confirm that the primary sequence is compatible with its modeled three dimensional structure. To rule out potential false positives, the structure was evaluated carefully for conservation of the necessary catalytic residues in a structural context as well. A summary of our findings is provided in Table 1. Group 1: The high scoring matches Eight putative orthologs identified in this search have particularly high confidence matches: CG1742, CG4086, CG6084, CG10602, CG6461, CG6154, CG12013 and CG18585. These proteins share at least 30% sequence identity with the human enzyme, possess the same overall fold, and display conservation of one or more key functional residue needed for activity. The first gene in this set, CG1742 (Microsomal glutathione S-transferase (MGST) -like, isoform A, NP_524696.1), encodes a protein of 152 residues and is predicted to have a single domain, Membrane Associated Proteins in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism (MAPEG, Pfam ID: PF01124) spanning residues18 to 148 amino. This gene has also been identified in a bioinformatics screen for MAPEG family member [65]. This protein displays 36% identity and 54% similarity to the sequence of human prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES, NP_004869.1). The human PTGES (PS-1) is an integral membrane protein that operates as a homotrimer and is known to catalyze the oxidoreduction of prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [66]. PTGES is characterized by the presence of a single MAPEG domain, which spans the region 16–146. PTGES (e.g., PDB ID: 4AL0; [67]) and is characteristic of several proteins belonging to the MAPEG family which includes MSGT and PTGES proteins [68]. This sequence is annotated as “MSGT-like” but the predicted structure of CG1742 is nearly identical and displays an RMSD 1.15 Å over 152 residues when superimposed with PTGES. PTGES, earlier referred to as MGST1-L1[69] is a glutathione-binding protein, and residues R38, R70, E77, R110, Y117, R126, and Y130 of human PTGES are associated with enzymatic activity as well as binding to glutathione [66,70]. Structural superposition reveals that CG1742 has a fully conserved set of these key functional residues, (R40, R71, E78, R111, Y118, R128, and F132). With respect to the last residue, a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution is likely to be functionally equivalent as phenylalanine and tyrosine have side chains with a single aromatic ring of similar volume. Phenylalanine differs only in that it lacks the hydroxyl group in the ortho position on the benzene ring. Since previous studies suggest that the aromatic ring of Y130 is likely important for PGH2-binding, an analog for this structural element is provided by F132 [70]. Details of modeled fly candidate PTGES and its comparison with human PTGES are provided in S1 Fig and a similar format is followed for all the candidate orthologs identified. The second gene in this set, CG4086 (Suppressor of ref(2)P sterility (Su(P)), NP_524116.2) encodes a 417 residue protein. CG4086 displays 42% identity and 62% similarity to the sequence of human prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PTGES2, NP_079348.1). PTGES2 is membrane-associated, as opposed to PTGES which is an integral membrane protein, though both catalyze the same reaction [71]. Despite the functional similarities, PTGES2 possesses a substantially different domain architecture and tertiary structure. The human PTGES2 possesses a GST-N3 domain (Pfam ID: PF13417) spanning amino acids 104–175 and a GST-C3 (Pfam ID: PF14497) domain spanning amino acids 201–368. CG4086 shares a highly similar domain architecture with the same domains spanning amino acids 125–184 and 248–396 respectively. PTGES2’s catalytic activity requires an essential residue, C110 [72]. The crystal structure of truncated PTGES2 has been published (PDB ID: 1Z9H; [73]), with the N-terminal membrane-associated region omitted (residues 1 to 99). Superposition of this truncated structure against the predicted structure of CG4086 reveals an RMSD of 0.814 Å over 377 residues. CG4086’s C133 overlaps with PTGES2’s C110, suggesting a match for this catalytic residue (S2 Fig). The third gene in this set, CG6084, encodes a 316 amino acid protein that is a high confidence match for the human Alcohol dehydrogenase NADP(+) (AKR1B1”, NP_001619.1). This enzyme, along with enzymes encoded by the related genes in this family (e.g., AKR1B15 and AKR1C3), catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. In particular, AKR1B1 and AKR1B15 are known to function as prostacyclin F synthases, converting prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) [74,75]. CG6084 and AKR1B1 share identical domain architectures [a single aldo/keto reductase family (Pfam ID: PF00248) domain], as well as 49% identity and 68% similarity at the level of primary structure. Three residues required for AKR1B1’s catalytic activity are Y48, K77 and H110 [76,77]. CG6084 possesses analogs for this triad of residues in the form of Y50, K79 and H112. In addition, the structural overlap of the predicted structure for CG6084 and human AKR1A1 (PDB ID: 2ALR; [78]) displays an RMSD of 0.847 Å over 316 residues (S3 Fig). The fourth gene in this set, CG10602 encodes a protein with 613 residues that displays 44% identity and 62% similarity to human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H, NP_000886.1). LTA4H is an epoxide hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the epoxide LTA4 to the diol, LTB4. This catalytic activity requires the presence of a zinc ion, which is coordinated by the catalytic triad of H296, H300 and E319. Residues E297, D376 and Y384 are also reportedly essential for efficient catalysis [79]. LTA4H’s domain architecture consists of Peptidase family M1 (Pfam ID: PF01433) spanning 13–387 and a Leukotriene A4 hydrolase, C-terminal domain (Pfam ID: PF09127) spanning amino acids 464–608. CG10602 shares an identical domain organization as well as the critical residues at H293, H297, E316 (the zinc triad) and E294, D374 and Y382. The tertiary structure similarity is readily apparent, as evidenced by a superposition of human LTA4H (PDB ID: 3B7U; [80]) and the predicted structure of CG10602, which results in an RMSD of 0.891 Å over 611 residues (S4 Fig). The fifth gene in this set, CG6461, encodes a 579 residue protein (Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, NP_573303.1) that shares 45% identity and 58% similarity to human Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase 1 (GGT1, NP_001275762.1). GGT1 cleaves the gamma-glutamyl bond of extracellular glutathione (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly), glutathione conjugates, and other gamma-glutamyl compounds. With respect to eicosanoid synthesis, GGT1 catalyzes the conversion of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) to leukotriene D4 (LTD4). GGT1 operates as a heterodimer consisting of small and large subunits which are produced from the same precursor that undergoes autocatalytic cleavage to produce the mature form of the enzyme. The only reported catalytic residue is T381, which corresponds to T382 in CG6461. GGT1 residues R107, T399 and E420 are believed to play a role in glutamate binding [81]. CG6461 possesses putative analogs for each of these residues, namely R107, T400 and E421, respectively. CG6461 and GGT1 also share identical domain architecture, with Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (Pfam ID: PF01019) domains spanning the majority of each protein. Superimposed, the human structure (PDB ID: 4GDX; [82]) and CG6461’s predicted structure displays an RMSD of 1.126 Å over 569 residues (S5 Fig). The sixth gene in this set, CG6154 (“DPEP,” NP_733146.2), encodes a 434 residue metallopeptidase that shares 49% identity and 65% similarity with human Dipeptidase, renal (DPEP1, NP_004404.1). Both enzymes contain a single Membrane dipeptidase (Pfam ID: PF01244) domain spanning the majority of the protein. DPEP1 is known to regulate leukotriene activity by catalyzing the conversion of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) to leukotriene E4 (LTE4) using zinc as a cofactor. To that end, the residues H36, D38, E141, H214 and H235 are reported to be essential for coordinating the zinc ions required for catalysis [83]. Aligned against CG6154, these residues correspond to H71, D73, E184, H257 and H278. This high degree of similarity extends to the tertiary structure, as the superimposed structure of human DPEP1 (PDB ID: 1ITQ; [83]) and the predicted structure of CG6154 display an RMSD of 0.523 Å over 411 residues (S6 Fig). The seventh gene in this set, CG12013 (“glutathione peroxidase,” NP_728870.1), encodes a 169 residue selenoprotein that is 35% identical and 52% similar to human glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1, NP_000572.2) and both contain a single glutathione peroxidase domain (Pfam ID: PF00255). As part of the eicosanoid pathway, GPX-1 converts the 12(S)-HpETE produced by lipoxygenase-12 (12-LOX) into 12(S)-HETE [84]. GPX1 requires a selenocysteine residue (U49) for catalysis [85]. CG12013’s amino acid sequence indicates that a cysteine residue is present at the corresponding position in this enzyme. However, this residue may in fact be a selenocysteine, as this substitution is unlikely to be detected by sequencing alone. Similarly, the tryptophan and glutamine residue that complete the catalytic triad are also conserved. A structural alignment of human GPX1 (PDB ID: 2F8A; unpublished, Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC)) and the predicted structure of CG12013 reveals an RMSD of 0.699 Å over 169 residues (S7 Fig). The eighth and final gene in this set, CG18585 (Carboxypeptidase A (CPA), NP_609132.1) encodes a 422 amino acid protein that is 35% identical and 55% similar to human Carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1, NP_001859.1). CPA1 is a metallocarboxypeptidase that requires a zinc atom as a cofactor for catalysis. CPA1 has been shown to convert the potent leukotriene C4 (LTC4) to the less potent leukotriene F4 (LTF4) by hydrolysis of an amide bond, suggesting that CPA1 serves to reduce inflammation [86]. The residues H179, E182, H306 and E380 are required for catalysis and coordinating zinc. These residues correspond to H178, E181, H305 and E382 in CPA. Aligned, the structure of human CPA1 (PDB ID: 3FJU; [87]) and the predicted structure of CG18585 display an RMSD of 0.753 Å over 419 residues (S8 Fig).Group 2: The midrange candidates Five candidates were identified in the search based on approaches focused more on structural similarity than underlying sequence conservation. Members of this set share at least 20% sequence identity with the human target but share similarity at the fold level and possess at least a partial set of conserved functional residue. The first gene in this set, CG8938 (GST-S1, NP_725653.1) encodes a 249 residue glutathione-S-transferase enzyme, which displays 36% identity and 60% similarity to human Hematopoietic Prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS, NP_055300.1). HPGDS, alternatively known as Prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase, is a glutathione-requiring prostaglandin D synthase. HPGDS operates as a homodimer, which can optionally be activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+ to increase catalytic efficiency to 150% of the basal level. Coordination of the metallic ion ligands is coordinated by D93, D96 and D97 [88]. CG8938 and GST-S1 share an identical domain architecture, with an N-terminal GST-N domain (Pfam ID: PF02798) and a C-terminal GST-C domain (Pfam ID: PF00043). Similarly, CG8938 possesses matches for two of the three aspartic residues required for enhanced catalytic activity, at positions D139 and D143 (corresponding to D93 and D97 in HPGDS). At the corresponding position aligned to D96, CG8938 instead has an asparagine (N142). However, mutagenesis studies by Inouie et al. have shown that a D to N substitution at this same position in HPGDS actually increases PGD2 synthesis [88]. In addition to this sequence-based evidence, superposition of the predicted CG8938 structure and human HPGDS (PDB ID: 1IYI; [88]) reveals an RMSD of 1.045 Å over 160 residues (S9 Fig). The second gene in this set, CG16817 (NP_649925.1) encodes a 184 residue protein, which displays 27% identity and 45% similarity to human Prostaglandin E synthase 3 (PTGES3, NP_006592.3). In contrast to PTGES1 and PTGES2 discussed above, PTGES3 is a cytosolic protein. However, all three enzymes share the same catalytic function, i.e., oxidoreduction of prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [89]. PTGES3 and CG16817 share an identical domain architecture, with the bipartite CHORD-containing proteins and SGT1 (CS) Domain (Pfam ID: PF04969) spanning the N-terminus to the middle of the protein. The C-terminal region of PTGES3 is notable for showing a compositional bias towards aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues in the range spanning 108 to 160. Currently, only one crystal structure for PTGES3 has been published (PDB ID: 1EJF; [90]) and this structure is limited to a truncated version of the protein spanning residue 1 to 110, i.e., the acidic C-terminal region has not been crystalized. An alignment of PTGES3 and CG16817 shows that CG16817 also displays a compositional bias towards acidic residues at its C-terminus, though it is unclear what role this bias serves in either protein. We were unable to generate a full-length model of CG16817 due to a lack of any suitable template structure for the C-terminal acidic region. However, the truncated CG16817 model (residues 1 to 113) shows an RMSD of 0.823 Å compared to PTGES3 over 160 residues (S10 Fig). The third gene in this set, CG11200 (Carbonyl reductase (CBR), NP_611471.1) encodes a 355 residue protein that displays 30% identity and 45% similarity to human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1, NP_001748.1). CBR1 is a NADPH-dependent reductase with broad substrate specificity, e.g., it can convert PGE2 to PGF2α. It has been reported that CBR1 binds to NADP via N90 and that Y194 serves as a proton acceptor for the reaction [91]. A corresponding match for both of these residues can be found in CG11200 at positions N154 and Y233. An alignment of human CBR1 (PDB ID: 3BHJ; [92]) against the predicted model for CG11200 shows an RMSD of 1.153 Å over 277 residues (S11 Fig). The fourth gene in this set, CG18814 (NP_652673.2), encodes a 267 amino acid protein that displays 34% identity and 53% similarity to human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase NAD(+)(HPGD, NP_000851.2). HPGD catalyzes the conversion of the 15-hydroxyl group of prostaglandins into a keto group, which strongly reduces the biologic activity of these molecules. As a result, HPGD is considered the primary enzyme responsible for degradation of prostaglandins. It has been reported that N91, S138, Q148 and Y151 are required for catalysis [93]. CG18814 residues N89, S137 and Y150 of CG18814 align with these catalytic residues and are oriented at overlapping or directly adjacent positions in close proximity in the structural alignment of the CG18814 model against the structure of HPGD. CG18814 lacks an obvious analog for Q148, which is located in a flexible loop region. However, CG18814 possesses a structurally-aligned loop region which contains Q142. Q148 and Q142 are located within approximately 5Å of each other and oriented similarly in a static superposition of the predicted model and crystal structure and may be functionally analogous. Moreover, both proteins have an identical domain architecture, with a short-chain dehydrogenase domain (Pfam ID: PF00106) spanning from the N-terminus to approximately residue 180. Superposition of human HPGD (PDB ID: 2GDZ; [93]) and the predicted structure of CG18814 reveals an RMSD of 0.715 Å over 266 residues (S12 Fig). The fifth and final gene in this set, CG3616 (CYP450-9c1, NP_523850.1) encodes a cytochrome P450 oxidase, which displays 31% identity and 49% similarity to human Thromboxane A synthase (TBXAS1, NP_001052.2). TBXAS1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where it catalyzes the conversion of PGH2 to thromboxane A2 (TBA2) [94]. TBXAS1 is categorized as a cytochrome p450 family (CYP450) enzyme based on sequence similarity. This categorization is illustrated by the fact that the only domain identified in TBXAS1 is a Cytochrome P450 domain (Pfam ID: PF00067) spanning most of the protein. CYP450 enzymes are highly conserved in eukaryotes, where they catalyze reactions in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids [95]. However, this ubiquitous nature of CYP450 enzymes makes it difficult to identify potential orthologs for any one specific enzyme within the family. CG3616 was selected as a candidate from the set of eight fly candidates with similar sequences after taking into account the initial sequence comparison, the transmembrane helix pattern (calculated using TOPCONS [96]), and the alignment score against a multiple sequence alignment of known or high confidence TBXAS1 orthologs. A structural superposition of a modeled human TBXAS1 (no structure available) with the predicted model of CG3616 showed an RMSD of 0.699 Å over 518 residues (S13 Fig).Group 3: The most distant candidates Many of the putative orthologs identified in D. melanogaster, although divergent in sequence from the human target, are similar enough that traditional methods for analyzing and aligning sequences can be utilized. However, we identified 6 sequences that could not be detected by or showed low sequence identity and/or low query coverage using traditional sequence alignment algorithms such as BLASTP and therefore, required more intensive analysis. The search for a cyclooxygenase ortholog proved to be one of these difficult cases. As noted above, it is widely accepted that D. melanogaster lacks a cyclooxygenase ortholog. However, there have been sporadic reports of prostaglandin detected in D. melanogaster extracts over the years [27]. The human genome encodes three major cyclooxygenase isozymes via two loci. PTGS1 encodes COX-1 (a constitutive cyclooxygenase), whereas PTGS2 encodes COX-2 (which is inducible and expressed in a tissue-specific manner). A truncated and poorly characterized isoform of PTGS1, COX-3 is also expressed in certain cells, and reportedly demonstrates reduced prostaglandin synthesis activity relative to COX-1 [97]. COX-1 and COX-2 operate as homodimers and are characterized by two domains: An N-terminal EGF-like domain (Pfam ID: IPR000742) and an animal heme peroxidase domain (Pfam ID: PF03098). The former allows for association with the cell and nuclear membrane while the latter is responsible for the cyclooxygenase activity. The COX enzymes initiate the prostaglandin synthesis pathway by converting arachidonic acid, or other polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) substrates, into the unstable intermediate PGG2 followed by PGH2. During this process, it has been reported that a small amount of the PUFA substrate is converted into a racemic mixture of 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acids (i.e., 15-HETEs), which may be processed into lipoxins, a poorly understood class of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. The COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes contain two active sites: a heme with peroxidase activity, responsible for the reduction of PGG2 to PGH2, and a cyclooxygenase site, where arachidonic acid is converted into the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) [6]. Extensive studies have been performed on the sheep ortholog of COX-1(NP_001009476.1; PDB ID: 1CQE), which is a proxy for the human orthologs [98]. These studies reveal that cyclooxygenase activity is mediated by Y385, which forms a radical capable of abstracting a hydrogen from the PUFA substrate (e.g., carbon-13 of arachidonic acid). H207 and H388 are also required for the dual peroxidase and cyclooxygenase functions of these enzymes [99,100]. Other functional residues identified in the literature include R120, Q203, V349, and S530 [101]. R120 interacts with C-1 of the PUFA substrate, arachidonic acid [102]. Q203 is conserved among mammalian COX enzymes, though the function of this residue is currently unknown. V349 is believed to play a role in substrate specificity; mammalian COX enzymes share this residue and show a substrate preference for arachidonic acid, while invertebrate COX enzymes that have a leucine at this position display specificity for linoleic acid [103] and S530 acetylation is the basis for COX-2 inhibition by aspirin [99]. Although an initial screen of D. melanogaster using BLASTP reported similar sequences with local matches, further investigation was needed to confirm if these candidates possessed the requisite features of a COX enzyme. Iterative HMMER searches confirmed four potential candidates: CG4009 (NP_650588.2), CG6969 (Cardinal, NP_651081.1), CG7660 (Pxt, NP_650648.3) and CG3477 (Pxd, NP_996223.1). Each of these candidates was added to a previously generated multiple sequence alignment containing PTGS1 and known or high confidence predicted orthologs using MAFFT as illustrated for CG4009 in Fig 2. The presence or absence of functional residues at or near aligned positions was noted. Similarly, the candidates were analyzed to determine the secondary structure and domain architecture of each protein. Following this filtering step, only three proteins remained as viable candidates for further study: CG4009, CG6969, and CG7660. CG7660 has been shown to demonstrate COX-like activity that plays an important role in Drosophila reproduction [29]. All three candidates appear to have the requisite catalytic triad and share a similar domain architecture, though they each lack the N-terminal EGF-like domain. Putative analogs for the H206, Y384 and H387 catalytic triad appear to be present on CG4009 at H163, Y399, H401 and on CG7660 at H222, Y564, H568, respectively. Fig 2. A multiple sequence alignment of the D. melanogaster candidate CG4009 with human PTGS1 and known or high confidence predicted orthologs. Open in a new tab Red asterisks below the MSA denotes conserved key catalytic residues. The green asterisk marks the putative analog for the tyrosine. The blue asterisk denotes an insertion of 42 residues in CG4009 and reads X in the alignment.Structural models of CG4009, CG6969, and CG7660 were built and validated as described above. PTGS1 (PDB ID: 3N8V; [104]) and the predicted structure for CG4009 both display a cyclooxygenase fold, and the predicted catalytic domains are superimposable with an RMSD of 2.660 Å over 599 residues (S14 Fig). CG7660 and CG6969 each display a similar tertiary structure and with predicted catalytic domains that overlap with PTGS1 with an RMSD of 2.810 and 2.942 Å, respectively. The predicted structures differ from PTGS1 at their N-termini, which is expected given the absence of the EGF-like domain, though the CG4009 structure is marginally closer. However, these three structures present the necessary catalytic residues in a similar orientation as in PTGS1 and so likely possess cyclooxygenase activity. The search for a potential ortholog for PTGDS also proved to be difficult. PTGDS is a second prostaglandin-D-synthase, which operates in conjunction with the isozyme HPGDS (discussed previously). BLAST-based searching failed to identify any D. melanogaster candidates for the human enzyme (NP_000945.3). However, iterative HMMER searches suggested CG33126 (Neural Lazarillo (NLaz), NP_787960.1) merits further scrutiny despite having only 12% identity and 31% similarity to PTGDS based on a structure based sequence alignment. Both proteins share similar domain architecture, namely a Lipocalin domain (Pfam ID: PF00061), which is known to take the form of a beta barrel structure. Structural superposition revealed that human PTGDS (PDB ID: 5WY9; unpublished) and the CG33126 model overlap with an RMSD of 2.084 Å over 190 residues and that CG33126 has an aligned match for PTGDS’s catalytic cysteine (C65) at position C67 [105]. CG33126 contains an N-terminal alpha helix that is absent from PTGDS, however this helix is predicted to be a signal peptide. PTGDS contains a similar N-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved during processing i.e., omitted from the 5WY9 crystal structure (S15 Fig). Prostacyclin synthase (PTGIS) is another enzyme that does not have a clear ortholog in D. melanogaster. PTGIS catalyzes the isomerization of PGH2 to prostacyclin, the only prostaglandin with a bicyclic ring structure [106]. PTGIS encodes a 500 amino acid enzyme characterized by a cytochrome p450 family domain ranging from position 30 to 494. The N-terminus is predicted to contain a 200 amino acid signal sequence. BLAST and iterative HMMER searches reveal multiple high-scoring full length matches among the various CYP450 enzymes encoded in the D. melanogaster genome. However, CG3466 (CYP450-4d2, NP_525043.1) was identified as the top candidate based upon similarity of its secondary structure profile. CG3466 possesses an aligned match for PTGIS’s heme axial ligand (C441) at position C449. PTGIS (PDB ID: 2IAG; [107]) and the modeled CG3466 are superimposable with an RMSD of 1.213 Å over 500 residues, despite sharing only 14% identity and 30% similarity at the sequence level gauged from a structure based sequence alignment (S16 Fig). Leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), is a 150 amino acid enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of leukotriene A4 with reduced glutathione to form leukotriene C4. BLAST searches against D. melanogaster fail to identify an obvious ortholog. However, an iterative HMMER search identified the 165 amino acid protein CG33178 (NP_788904.1) as a potential candidate. The two proteins share full length identity of 18% and similarity of 31% discerned from a structure based sequence alignment and have an identical domain architecture in the form of a single MAPEG domain (Pfam ID: PF01124) spanning the bulk of the protein. Studies of the crystal structure of LTC4S (PDB ID: 2PNO; [108]) have revealed that it is an integral membrane protein composed of four transmembrane helices and that it functions as a homotrimer. The predicted model of CG33178 displays a similar fold, consisting of a bundle of four alpha helices, and it superimposes on 2PNO with an RMSD of 1.257 Å over 150 residues (S17 Fig). CG33178 also displays potential equivalents for each of LTC4S’s catalytically relevant residues (R30, R31 and R104) at positions R51, R53 and R139. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP, NP_001620.2), the final target protein in this set, is required for leukotriene synthesis by arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5). It has been reported that ALOX5AP functions by binding ALOX5 to the membrane and loading polyunsaturated fatty acid substrates (e.g., arachidonic acid) onto ALOX5 for conversion into leukotriene A4. Like LTC4S above, ALOX5AP is a MAPEG family protein that functions as a membrane-associated homotrimer. BLAST searches for a potential ortholog do not identify a clear match in D. melanogaster, though iterative HMMER searches reveal CG33177 and CG33178 as potential candidates. Both are MAPEG family proteins with highly similar sequences and predicted tertiary structures. CG33178 displays greater sequence similarity to LTC4S and analogs for the catalytically relevant residues and so was assigned as the top candidate for LTC4S. As a result, CG33177 was selected as the top candidate for a potential ortholog for ALOX5AP. The CG33177 structural model displays 13% identity and 28% similarity with human ALOX5A based on a structural overlap (PDB ID: 2Q7M; [109]) with an RMSD of 1.024 Å over 161 residues (S18 Fig).Discussion A schematic of a putative D. melanogaster eicosanoid synthesis pathway based on our analysis is shown in Fig 3. Notably, the pathway appears to account for a full complement of prostaglandin synthesis enzymes. A functional thromboxane synthesis pathway may also be present, as potential orthologs for thromboxane A synthase have been identified. However, given the structural and sequence similarity of TBXA synthase to the numerous functionally unrelated cytochrome P450 oxidase in the D. melanogaster genome, speculation must be reserved pending experimental validation. Fig 3. A theoretical eicosanoid synthesis pathway in D. melanogaster. Open in a new tab A graphical overview of fly candidates in the putative pathway shown alongside the human enzymes as well as superposed with it. Boxed names represent the intermediates or end products (Red: Prostaglandins; Blue: Thromboxanes; Green: Leukotrienes; Yellow: HETEs). Enzymes for which orthologs could not be identified are represented by dashed ovals. The three candidate groups are marked next to the enzymes in a similar manner as Table 1: high-confidence (regular font; Group 1), mid-range (underlined; Group 2), and distant (italicized and bold font; Group 3).The existence of a leukotriene synthesis arm of the pathway could not be fully resolved since a thorough search of the D. melanogaster genome has failed to identify a potential lipoxygenase, which is critical for the initial processing of the PUFA substrate into leukotriene intermediates. Interestingly, potential orthologs exist for each of the downstream leukotriene processing enzymes. Based upon our current understanding of the mammalian pathway, a functional lipoxygenase is necessary for HETE intermediates and the corresponding final products (e.g., lipoxins and other non-canonical eicosanoids) [110]. Our data challenges that view that D. melanogaster lacks a functional eicosanoid synthesis pathway [110–112] and suggests that it may in fact possess potential orthologs for some or majority of the eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. These candidates may have thus far eluded detection because of high sequence divergence compared to the mammalian enzymes. However, the modeling results from our study, suggest that these candidates share the same overall fold and matches for the known or predicted catalytic residues. The prediction of eicosanoid synthesis enzymes may explain the in vivo effects of aspirin and prostaglandins in oogenesis [29] and possibly the existence of eicosanoid-like compounds in D. melanogaster [27,28,113]. Our results however raise many questions: (a) What are the exact roles of individual enzymes; do they catalyze the reactions their structures predict they should? (b) What are the intermediate and final end products of the pathway? (c) What are the principal physiological events these intermediate and final biosynthetic products control and how similar are the signaling mechanisms by which their effects are mediated in cells and tissues? The apparent absence of lipoxygenase may be explained in part by the multiple cyclooxygenase genes in the D. melanogaster genome where one of more of these may only or also possess lipoxygenase like activity. Dual function cyclooxygenases can generate prostaglandins and lipoxygenase products (e.g. HPETEs). For example, mammalian cyclooxygenases can produce limited amounts of 11- and 15-HPETE as a by-product in addition to PGH [114–116] and aspirin-acetylated COX-2 has been shown to produce 15R-HETEs [117]. Similar activity by one of the putative D. melanogaster COX orthologs could provide upstream processing needed for 11- and 15-HPETE, though this fails to provide the 5-HPETE intermediate needed for downstream leukotriene synthesis. Alternatively, 5-HETEs may be produced using an unconventional mechanism by the COX candidates or perhaps by an unidentified enzyme. The existence of structurally conserved downstream leukotriene synthesis enzymes suggests that the upstream intermediates are likely present in some form. Drosophila may possess a CYP450 enzyme capable of synthesizing 5-HETE; lipoxygenase-like CYP450s have been identified that produce 5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 12- and 20-HETEs [118,119]. Recent studies have reported on bacterial lipoxygenases which are highly divergent from animal and plant lipoxygenases, both in terms of overall sequence conservation and the presence of expected catalytic residues [120]. There is also a possibility that D. melanogaster and other insect expresses a functional 5-LOX that differs radically from the canonical profile of a lipoxygenase. The existence of a functional eicosanoid synthesis pathway requires both the presence of the requisite synthetic enzymes and suitable substrates. The mammalian eicosanoids are primarily derived from 20-carbon PUFAs (arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid), as well as from 18-carbon PUFAs (γ-linolenic acid, α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid). In the vertebrate pathway, the 18-carbon fatty acids linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid can be processed into the 20-carbon PUFAs arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, respectively, via a three-step process involving a Δ6 desaturase, an elongase, and, a Δ5 desaturase. These 20-carbon PUFAs are then capable of being processed by COX or LOX to generate the canonical eicosanoids. 18-carbon PUFAs (e.g., linoleic acid) may also be processed by 15-LOX into 9- and 13-HODEs, a subfamily of non-canonical eicosanoids. According to previous studies Drosophila appear to lack homologs for the mammalian Δ5 and Δ6 desaturases based upon sequence analyses, and so it should be unable to synthesize 20–22 carbon PUFAs from essential fatty acid precursors [112]. Furthermore, flies raised in the absence of 20-carbon PUFAs for several generations remain healthy, implying that 20-carbon PUFAs are non-essential [112]. Thus, it is generally accepted that Drosophila rely on PUFAs obtained from its vegetarian diet, which is generally limited to the essential 18-carbon fatty acids linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Based on the current understanding that D. melanogaster lacks Δ5 and Δ6 desaturase activity, it would be expected that the 18-carbon PUFAs obtained from its diet are processed into HODEs as opposed to eicosanoid derivatives of the 20-carbon PUFAs. Recent studies have validated this hypothesis, and confirmed the presence of 9- and 13-HODEs in D. melanogaster extracts (Govind lab, unpublished work); [121]. However, given the reports of prostaglandin-like molecules in D. melanogaster extracts, it is probable that additional lipid processing occurs to produce compounds similar to the canonical eicosanoids but the biosynthetic components have not been identified yet. Further computational and experimental work is needed to fully resolve these issues. Altogether, the present study suggests that D. melanogaster may possess a functional equivalent for the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis pathway. Our results highlight the need for customizing advanced prediction methods to identify orthologs, and to build structural models that predict the requisite biochemistry for function. These findings, combined with other recent biochemical studies, suggest the possibility that D. melanogaster likely utilizes eicosanoid signaling. However, further experimental studies will be needed to be address the exact role and physiological context of these biosynthetic enzymes. The importance of our study lies in opening up this powerful model organism for the study of eicosanoid signaling, in the context of inflammation as well as non-inflammation related physiology.Supporting information S1 Fig. Sequence and structural details of the modeled fly PTGES candidate.A.

    "title": "Immune suppressive extracellular vesicle proteins of Leptopilina heterotoma are encoded in the wasp genome.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6945029/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Leptopilina heterotoma are obligate parasitoid wasps that develop in the body of their Drosophila hosts. During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species.

    "methods": "Materials and Methods Insects Isogenized Lh strains New York (NY; (Chiu and Govind 2002; Chiu et al. 2006)) and Lh 14 (Schlenke et al. 2007), were raised on the y w strain of D. melanogaster that were reared on standard cornmeal, yeast, and agar fly food at 25° as described by Small et al. (2012). Adult wasps were collected from parasitized hosts, 25 days after infection at 25°. Male and female wasps were stored on fly food with 70% honey on “buzz” plugs. Analysis of MSEV super-set ORFs Previously undescribed open reading frames (ORFs) from the Lh 14 MSEV proteome and sequenced as part of Heavner et al. (2017) (PXD005632) are analyzed in the context of the published female abdominal (Goecks et al. 2013) and whole body (this study) Lh 14 transcriptomes. We have not observed any difference in venom activities of Lh 14 and Lh NY (Morales et al. 2005; Schlenke et al. 2007), or in wasp success under laboratory conditions. The Lh 14 ORFs were aligned against transcripts from BioProject: PRJNA202370, Accession number GAJC0000000 (Goecks et al. 2013) as previously described in Heavner et al. (2017). Proteins with an ORF and a transcript were run through the BLAST2GO (v 5.2; downloaded June 2018) annotation pipeline with an E-value threshold of 1x10−7 (Conesa et al. 2005; Götz et al. 2008). Results were organized and classified based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms from UniProt and InterPro (Ashburner et al. 2000; Jones et al. 2014; Uniport Consortium 2015; The Gene Ontology Consortium 2019). Proteins were considered “virulence-related” based on GO terms indicating involvement with infection, host evasion, inflammation, and immune response. ORFs that did not return results via BLAST or InterProScan (Class 3 proteins) were run through Conserved Domain Search (CDD) on  (version 3.16) (Marchler-Bauer et al. 2017). The E-value cut off for CDD search was 1x10−2. Proteins were considered to have a signal peptide if one was predicted using Phobeus and Signal P (Käll et al. 2004; Käll et al. 2007; Nielsen 2017; Almagro Armenteros et al. 2019). Transmembrane domains were considered to be present if they were predicted using Phobeus and TMHMM (Sonnhammer et al. 1998; Krogh et al. 2001; Käll et al. 2004; Käll et al. 2007). The GhostKOALA algorithm (Kanehisa et al. 2016) was used to assign KEGG ortholog (KO) numbers for the MSEV superset protein sequences. If a primary KO number failed to be assigned by GhostKOALA, a secondary number assignment with a score >= 50 was used. Redundant KO numbers were excluded. MSEV proteins were included in the enrichment analyses only if a human ortholog exists; the gene identifiers for human orthologs were obtained from the MSEV KO and the UniProt mapping utility (Li et al. 2015; Uniport Consortium 2015). (Human orthologs were chosen because a robust proportion of Vesiclepedia’s data are derived from human vesicle proteomes.) The orthologs of human genes were analyzed for enrichment with the FunRich algorithm (Pathan et al. 2015; Pathan et al. 2017) against the Vesiclepedia database (Kalra et al. 2012; Pathan et al. 2019). Finally, the MSEV proteome was used as a query using BLASTp for the following databases: “non-redundant” (nr), nr restricted to Taxid: Viridae (10239), nr restricted to Taxid: Polydnaviridae (10482), and nr restricted to Taxid: Unclassified Polydnaviridae (40273) (E-value threshold: 1.0x10−3, %ID minimum: 20%, performed 04/16/2019). tBLASTn of L. boulardi and G. hookeri (previously called Ganaspis spp. 1) (Goecks et al. 2013) transcriptomes was performed on 03/10/2019; the threshold for homologs in Lb and G. hookeri were 25% ID and an E-value of 1.0x10−10. Genomes sequencing and assembly Library preparations, sequencing reactions, and associated validations were conducted by GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Genomic DNA was extracted from ∼50 mg of tissue (∼100 wasps) of Lh males and females separately using mixed bead beating and PureLink Genomic DNA extraction kits following manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of extracted DNA was performed using Nanodrop and Qubit2.0 Fluorometer (Live Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Integrity of genomic DNA was verified by gel electrophoresis (0.6% agarose). DNA libraries were prepared for each wasp gender by acoustic shearing fragmentation using a Covaris S220. Fragments were end repaired and adenylated prior to adapter ligation on 3′ ends (NEB NextUltra DNA Library Preparation kit, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Enrichment and indexing of adapter-ligated DNA was done through limited cycle PCR. DNA library validation was performed using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Libraries were quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Real time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to quantify DNA molar mass for each library before multiplexing in equal molar mass. DNA libraries were sequenced using a 2x150 paired-end (PE) configuration on one lane on an Illumina HiSeq 4000. Image analysis and base calling were performed using the HiSeq Control Software (HCS) on the HiSeq instrument. The average size of inserts (without adaptors) in the Illumina library was ∼300-350 bp. De novo assembly of reads and scaffolding of contigs was performed using ABySS 2.2 (Jackman et al. 2017) by the New York Genome Center. De novo assembly of combined male/female genome was performed using Platanus-allee (Kajitani et al. 2019) and scaffolding was improved using AGOUTI (Zhang et al. 2016) on the University of Delaware’s BIOMIX cluster. Sequences from Drosophila-associated bacteria such as Wolbachia spp., Acetobacter pasteurianus, and Lactobacillus plantarum were identified in both assemblies. Wolbachia are endosymbionts of many insects including Leptopilina spp. (Pannebakker et al. 2004; Werren et al. 2008; Gueguen et al. 2012). Lactobacilli and Acetobacter are symbionts and commensals of sugar-consuming insects (Crotti et al. 2010; Engel and Moran 2013). Among the three bacterial species, Wolbachia sequences were the most abundant. BLASTx analysis showed that predicted genes from Wolbachia scaffolds were associated with Wolbachia proteins in GenBank. These bacterial and mitochondrial sequence-containing scaffolds were identified during the  submission process and were manually removed from the submission. Evaluation of genome assemblies Assemblies made with ABySS and Platanus-allee with AGOUTI were run through QUAST v4.0 (Mikheenko et al. 2016) to determine scaffold number, N50, and GC%. All assemblies were examined for conserved genes and orthologs with BUSCO v9 (Simão et al. 2015; Waterhouse et al. 2017) using the Insecta set and training parameters set to “Nasonia”.  BLAST+ (v 2.7.1) was used to compare selected scaffolds produced from male and female genome assemblies (Johnson et al. 2008; Camacho et al. 2009). E-value threshold was set at 1x10−7. E-values of alignments were considered acceptable if within the range of 0 to 1x10−10. K-mer analysis was performed using the K-mer Analysis Toolkit (KAT) (Mapleson et al. 2016) and heat maps were used to compare multiplicity (coverage plus repeats) of K-mers to GC content of the reads, coloring bins according to the number of distinct K-mers in each. This analysis was used to determine whether there were separate clusters of multiplicity/GC content that might arise from different sources, such as contamination. BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990; Camacho et al. 2009; Johnson et al. 2008) was used to search for homologs of a random sample of genomic scaffolds to which reads from each cluster mapped. The joint assembly of the Lh 14 genome was compared to the published L. clavipes genome (Bioproject: PRJNA84205 (Kraaijeveld et al. 2016)) through maps of 27-mer multiplicity vs. GC content. Finally, 27-mer multiplicity/GC content of the scaffolds (9.6 Mb) containing MSEV genes was compared to a random subset of scaffolds (9.6 Mb) without MSEV genes. Statistical differences between Lh 14 and L. clavipes genomes and between MSEV-gene containing scaffolds and non-MSEV-gene containing scaffolds were calculated using a multivariate Cramér test (Ihaka and Gentleman 1996; Baringhaus and Franz 2004; Franz 2019). Gene predictions, gene annotation, and viral gene searches Gene predictions were performed on parallel and anti-parallel strands using AUGUSTUS (v3.3.1; August 2018) (Stanke et al. 2004; Stanke and Morgenstern 2005; Keller et al. 2011) with the Nasonia training set. The AUGUSTUS readout was separated into mRNA, coding DNA sequence (CDS), and translations by gffread (Trapnell et al. 2012). Gene predictions were annotated by performing a BLASTx of all gene predictions against the entire nr database (Downloaded on January 2019) and InterProScan on the University of Delaware BIOMIX Cluster before using BLAST2GO (Conesa et al. 2005; Götz et al. 2008) to finish annotation based on BLASTx and InterProScan results.  BLAST+ (v 2.7.1) was used on a local machine to search predictions and scaffolds, cutoff was %ID >70%, E-value < 1E-50, and query coverage > 70%. MSEV genes and 1x10−2 for Polydnavirus and Nudivirus proteins. Family Polydnaviridae and Nudiviridae protein sequences for the 11 species available on OrthoDB v9 were downloaded on February 2019 (Johnson et al. 2008; Camacho et al. 2009). Whole-body transcriptome sequencing and assembly Total RNA extraction, library preparations, sequencing reactions, and bioinformatics analysis were conducted at GENEWIZ, INC (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). RNA was extracted from frozen tissue with the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Universal mini kit using manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The extracted RNA was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and its integrity was checked with the 4200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). RNA samples were enriched for mRNA using Oligo d(T) beads. RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The sequencing libraries were validated by using the Agilent TapeStation. Quantification was performed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems, Wilimington, MA, USA). Sequencing libraries were clustered on a single lane of a flow cell and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument using a 2x150 PE configuration. Image analysis and base calling were conducted by the HCS. Raw sequence data (.bcl files) was converted into fastq files and de-multiplexed using Illumina’s bcl2fastq 2.17 software. One mismatch was allowed for index sequence identification. The Trinity v2.5 (Grabherr et al. 2011), de novo assembler was used to assemble the Lh 14 transcripts. The de novo assembled transcriptome was created with a minimum contig length of 200 bp per sample. Transrate v1.0.3 (Smith-Unna et al. 2016) was used to generate statistics for the de novo assembled transcriptome. EMBOSS tools getorf were then used to find the ORFs within the de novo assembled transcriptome. The de novo transcriptome assembly was then annotated using Diamond BLASTx (Buchfink et al. 2015). The transcriptome reads were mapped to the genomic scaffolds for downstream analyses using HISAT2 or BWA (Li and Durbin 2009; Kim et al. 2015). Preparation of template DNA and PCR Male and female wasps (n = 12, for each sex), were separated and washed in 70% ethanol, and then rinsed twice in deionized water. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using a Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit following provided protocols. gDNA was eluted in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, and stored at 4°. The concentration of gDNA was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher). For cDNA preparation, male and female wasps (n = 12 for each sex), were separated and washed in 70% ethanol and rinsed twice in deionized water. Total body RNA was extracted using 100 µL of Trizol (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s protocols. RNA was resuspended in 0.1% DEPC treated water and treated with DNase I to remove contaminating DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RNA concentration was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher). cDNA was synthesized using Proto-Script First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs). Analysis of select genes Primers for p40 and SmGTPase01 are as follows: p40 forward: GAATCATTGTTCGTTTGCTTGAAGAAAGAATTGG p40 reverse: CATTATTAATGGGCCTTTACAATAATTTTAGCC SmGTPase01 forward: CGTTGCACTACCTTGTTTGTCA SmGTPase01 reverse: TTGTCTTTGCCCTGAGCGTT PCRs were performed with Taq polymerase (gift of C. Li lab, CCNY), PCR buffer (300 mM Tris HCl pH 9.5, 75 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM MgCl2) and deoxyribonucleotides (0.2 mM; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel in Tris acetic acid EDTA buffer (40 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 20 mM acetic acid, 1mM EDTA pH 8.0). Ethidium bromide (Sigma Aldrich)-stained gels were visualized on an ultra violet Trans-Illuminator (UVP) and gel images were taken using the DigiDocIt Imaging System (UVP). Gel images were processed in Adobe Photoshop for clarity only. gDNA or cDNA-containing PCR products were cloned into pCR TOPO II plasmids (Invitrogen) and transformed into DH10β competent cells (New England Biolabs). For plasmid preparation, colonies were screened via PCR and positive colonies were cultured in Luria Broth with ampicillin (100 µg/mL) at 37° overnight. Plasmids were extracted using Plasmid Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced (GENEWIZ, INC. South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Sequences were aligned using  BLAST+ (Johnson et al. 2008; Camacho et al. 2009) and Clustal Omega (Li et al. 2015). Expected PCR band sizes were determined using SerialCloner (v2.6.1).

    "results": "Results and Discussion The MSEV proteome superset A comparative study of the proteomes of the MSEVs from Lh 14 and Lh NY strains previously generated a list of 161 “common” MSEV proteins (Heavner et al. 2017). More than 90% of the 161 proteins are part of the Lh 14 MSEV proteome. To describe MSEVs more completely, we characterized a larger set of 407 MSEV proteins from Lh 14 (161 common and 246 Lh 14) and define this set as the Lh MSEV “super-set” (Figure 1A). Key results from annotation-based classification, analysis for signal peptide and/or transmembrane domain, and presence/absence of proteins in related wasps are summarized below and in Table S1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The superset of MSEV proteins: (A) Lh 14 MSEV proteins were annotated using BLAST2GO prior to class sorting via annotation and GO Terms. Wedges denoted as “Common,” were previously published in (Heavner et al. 2017) and represent proteins found in both Lh 14 and Lh NY MSEV proteomes. New proteins analyzed in this work are in wedges labeled “Lh 14 Only.” A majority of proteins belong to Class 1. Table S1 lists 246 proteins added to the superset Lh 14 proteome. (B) and (C) Enrichment analysis of MSEV superset shows high association with exosomes and mitochondria compared to other cellular organelles according to Vesiclepedia. –log 10 (p-value) trend shown in orange for both graphs. The p-values were calculated with the Bonferroni method. (B) Percentage of MSEV genes associated with specific cellular compartments found in Vesiclepedia, relative to all MSEV genes. Of the superset proteins, 41 and 49% are associated with mitochondria and exosomes, respectively (P = 3 × 10−57; 1 × 10−53). (C) Fold-enrichment of the MSEV dataset in specific cellular compartments. Although many protein classes are present in the proteome, exosomal and mitochondrial proteins show more significant enrichments.The presence/absence of signal peptide (SP) alone, or SP with/without the transmembrane (TM) domain(s) in MSEV proteins reveals their possible location (i.e., potentially secreted into the venom gland lumen or associated with MSEV membrane). We therefore searched the 246 Lh 14 proteins for SP and TM domains. Of the 246 proteins, 55 (22.35%) have a predicted SP domain, 37 (15.04%) have a predicted TM domain, while 6 (2.44%) have both a predicted SP and TM domain. After annotation, we found that a majority (183/246 or 75%) of the 246 proteins can be classified as core eukaryotic cell biology proteins (Class 1); 13/246 (5%) proteins as virulence- and immunity-related based on associated GO terms (Ashburner et al. 2000; The Gene Ontology Consortium 2019) (Class 2); and 50/246 or 20% as novel sequences without high confidence annotation (Class 3) (Table S1). A presence/absence analysis of these 246 proteins in published transcriptomes (Goecks et al. 2013) of Lb or a more distantly related wasp, G. hookeri (for thresholds see Methods) revealed the following: only 43/246 (17%) Lh MSEV proteins are expected to be found in Lb and/or G. hookeri (Table S1). Of these, 33/43 (77%) proteins were in Class 1 but only 7/43 (16%) and 3/43 (7%) were in Class 2 and Class 3 categories, respectively. These results support the idea that, multiple but different, infection strategies and/or host evasion strategies might exist among different wasps infecting the same hosts. While most of the Class 1 proteins were annotated as ribosomal or mitochondrial-related, a few were described as integral membrane proteins, vesicle trafficking protein SEC22b (E-value: 6.22E-145), and the ion channels sideroflexin 1 and 2 (E-value: 0). We also identified an apolipophorin (E-value: 1.02E-7) (Table S1). The presence of these membrane-associated proteins reinforces the vesicular nature of MSEVs. Examples of Class 2 proteins include the neural/ectodermal development factor IMP-L2 (E-value: 5.29x10−50) and a protein involved in pain reception, CG9231 (E-value: 4.39x10−15). A viral-like Diedel protein (E-value: 1.77x10−7), viral Enhancin (E-value: 6.02x10−5), l(2)37Cc (E-value: 3.39x10−165), odorant binding protein 56d-like (E-value: 5.64x10−50), major royal jelly protein (E-value: 8.59x10−135), and two venom acid-phosphatases Acph-1 (E-value: 4.12x10−5) were also found in the Class 2 category; their cDNA sequences were published previously (Heavner et al. 2013) (Table S1). It is possible that these MSEV proteins modulate the hosts’ immune responses and/or influence host development to facilitate successful parasitism. Within Class 3, 45 proteins (90%) lacked BLASTp and InterProScan results. However, Conserved Domain Database (CDD) (Marchler-Bauer et al. 2017) searches returned 9 hits identifying potentially functional domains (Table 1). This included (a) a CD99L2 like antigen (%ID: 24%, E-value: 3x10−3), (b) a DEAD-like helicases superfamily member (%ID: 22%, E-value 2x10−4) and (c) a herpes outer envelope glycoprotein 350 (gp350), (%ID: 28%, E-value: 4x10−3) (Table 1). Table 1. CDD-search results of MSEV “un-annotated” proteins in the super-set. MSEV ORFs that completed the BLAST2GO pipeline and did not return any results were run through the  CDD-Search Version 3.16 (Accessed: Aug. 2018). Of 45 queries, only 9 returned hits with threshold set to 1x10−2. The ninth result came from a search with E-value threshold set to 1.

BLASTp DELTA-BLAST of the potential gp350 domain against the nr database for Hymenoptera yielded an uncharacterized protein as the best hit (%ID: 24%, E-value: 8x10−6) in the ant Vollenhovia emeryi. This ant protein is predicted to contain calcium-binding EGF domains. The second hit in this search is from N. vitripennis for a predicted mucin-3A like glycoprotein (Gendler and Spicer 1995) (%ID: 24%, E-value: 2x10−4). Interestingly, transcripts related to the potential Lh gp350-like protein are not found in the Lb or G. hookeri transcriptomes (Table S1) (Goecks et al. 2013). Presence of this gp350-like protein in Lh MSEVs, but its absence in Lb MSEVs, suggests that it somehow contributes to differences in Lh/Lb host-parasite interactions and is therefore worthy of future studies. Complement receptor type 2 (CR2) in human B lymphocytes interacts with gp350 during Epstein-Barr infection (Young et al. 2008) and finding a verified homolog of CR2 in Drosophila hosts would be interesting in future research. Because more than 200 proteins have now been added to the previously described MSEV proteome (Heavner et al. 2017), we re-evaluated our previous enrichment analysis. In an ortholog-based comparison of the superset to human extracellular vesicle (EV) proteomes in Vesiclepedia (the most current and robust source of EV data (Kalra et al. 2012)), we found that the largest proportion of superset proteins (49%) are proteins specifically associated with exosomes (Figure 1B). In human and mouse EV proteomes, mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins are enriched (Kalra et al. 2012). Accordingly, protein components of mitochondria (e.g., respiratory chain) and ribosomes (e.g., large and small subunit proteins) are found to be highly enriched in the Lh MSEV superset. However, we found that the significance of the enrichment was higher between the superset and exosomal proteins than mitochondrial or ribosomal proteins (Figure 1C). These results demonstrate the similarities in the protein profiles of MSEVs and EVs. Do Lh MSEVs contain homologs of PDV or viral proteins? Even though figitid Leptopilina wasps are distantly related to PDV-containing Ichneumonid and Braconid wasps (Misof et al. 2014; Strand and Burke 2015), an association of PDV-like viruses in figitid wasps cannot be discounted because of shared evolutionary history. Recent publications have identified capsid-less VLPs in Ichneumonidae wasps (Volkoff et al. 2010; Pichon et al. 2015; Burke et al. 2018) and it is possible that Lh MSEVs have a similar viral origin. We therefore analyzed the Lh MSEV proteome superset against the GenBank PDV database, and then against its entire Viridae database. To identify false positives, MSEV proteins with positive PDV hits (E-values were less than 1.0x10−3, %ID was 20% or greater, and query coverage was 30% or higher) were also searched against the unrestricted nr database to compare relatedness. If an MSEV protein is similar to a viral or virus-related PDV protein, we expected that, in the unrestricted nr database search, the MSEV query sequence would align again with the same viral subject sequences, but with a lower E-value (Table S2). For PDV searches (Taxid: 10482 and Taxid: 40273), four proteins returned hits with E-values better than 1.0x10−20 and query coverage greater than 30%. Three of these hits are conserved proteins (cytochrome P450 and histone 4) while the fourth result identified an uncharacterized Cotesia congregata bracovirus (CcBV) protein (%ID: 31.08%, E-value: 1.38x10−17, query coverage: 77%) (Table S2). The unbiased BLASTp search against the entire nr database however had better results against eukaryotic proteins (E values: 0 to 2.0x10−7 and %ID from 100 to 56.25) (Table S2). In fact, the query that yielded the CcBV protein was better matched to a eukaryotic ribonuclease (%ID: 26.06%, E-value 1.14x10−16, query coverage: 84%) (Table S2). These results suggest that MSEV sequence similarities with PDV proteins may not be significant. We also searched the Lh MSEV superset for presence of L. boulardi Filamentous Virus (LbFV) homologs (LbFV is a behavior manipulating virus of Lb (Varaldi et al. 2006; Patot et al. 2012)). Of LbFV’s 108 genes, 13 are present in genomes of Lb, Lh and related species, and the 13 transcripts are expressed in the Lb venom gland (Di Giovanni et al. 2019). Within our thresholds, we obtained only three (of 13) sequences with similarity to LbFV ORFs. However, these three Lh MSEV proteins, with hits for LbFV sequences obtained better scoring hits in the unrestricted nr database, suggesting that the Lh MSEV proteins are not highly related to the LbFV proteins (Table S2). When comparing MSEV proteins to the entirety of Viridae, a total of 35 MSEV proteins had hits with %IDs ranging from 30 to 71% and E-values ranging from 1.0x10−22 to 1.0x10−178 (Table S2). However, a BLASTp search against the entire nr database found that proteins with results for viral hits had better scores when searched against the entire nr database, indicating that while viral hits are possible, they are not the best match (Table S2). This result, in addition to the fact that 372 other MSEV proteins (including the Diedel and Enhancin (Table S1)) did not return viral hits, would indicate that a majority of MSEV proteins are not closely related to viral proteins. The whole-body transcriptome contains expressed MSEV transcripts We performed a mixed-gender whole-body transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly of Lh transcripts. This assembly generated 104,066 transcripts. This dataset is more than three times larger than the published data derived from abdomens of female wasps that has 31,400 transcripts (Goecks et al. 2013). A BLAST analysis of the female abdominal transcripts against the male/female whole-body transcripts showed that a majority (21,493/31,400, 68.4%) were present in the latter data set. We searched the whole-body transcriptome for MSEV protein coding sequences using tBLASTn. Of 407 MSEV superset proteins, we identified transcripts for 371 (91.1%) proteins. Despite the ∼9% discrepancy (likely due to differences in expression levels due to different experimental conditions), these results largely verify the transcript data from (Goecks et al. 2013) that we have based our proteomic analyses on. Of the 371 MSEV transcripts identified, 233 (63%) encode Class 1, 44 (12%) encode Class 2, and 94/371 (25%) encode Class 3 proteins. Assembly of the Lh genome We separately sequenced Lh 14 male and female genomic DNA and assembled the paired-end reads de novo, using ABySS (Jackman et al. 2017). These assemblies have a modest scaffold N50 of 4,800 with more than 100,000 scaffolds and an average coverage of 87% (Table 2). Assembly with MaSurCa (Zimin et al. 2013) provided similar results (data not shown), indicating that our assembly quality is limited likely due to factors such as large genome size and repetitive sequence regions (Dominguez Del Angel et al. 2018). Although the N50 values and large number of scaffolds indicate that the genome is not highly assembled, we found at least 80% of BUSCOs shared in the Insecta set in both assemblies (Table 2, BUSCOs in Table S3). Table 2. Assembly statistics: Statistics of male, female, and combined (male plus female) Lh genomes as assessed by QUASTv4.0 and BUSCOv9.0. Percent coverage was found by mapping sequencing reads back to assembly using HISAT2. The identified BUSCOs can be found in Table S1. The QUAST program was run with parameters set for eukaryotic genomes and scaffolds. The BUSCO program was run with species set to ‘Nasonia.’ Contigs smaller than 500 bp were excluded.

The number of found BUSCOs in the joint assembly rose to 90% (Table 2, BUSCOs in Table S3). Analysis of K-mer multiplicity vs. GC content in the genome sequencing reads using the K-mer analysis tool, KAT (Mapleson et al. 2016) showed three possible clusters, although they are difficult to distinguish (Figure 2A). Cluster 1 has high multiplicity (450-650), Cluster 2 has lower multiplicity and a wide range of GC content, and Cluster 3 has the lowest multiplicity and the highest GC content. Cluster 3 overlaps with Cluster 2 making them hard to fully separate. BLAST searches of a random sample (1,672/4,482) from Cluster 1 contigs hit insect homologs 73% (1,220/1,672) of the time, Acetobacter homologs 13% (216/1,672) of the time, and then a variety of mostly Eukaryotic hits. Cluster 2 represents a majority of the wasp genome (>94%), and blast hits of a random sample (316/68,173) of its contigs almost exclusively had homologs in Hymenoptera (311/316; 98%) and mostly in L. heterotoma (227/316; 71%). Cluster 3 is the smallest of the three and contigs from Cluster 3 had homologs exclusively in Acetobacter (110/110). There was no evidence for contamination from a viral source or discrete MSEV-specific set of nucleic acid sequence. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Analysis of K-mer coverage vs. GC count. (A) Analysis of genomic reads. 27-mers generated from the cleaned Illumina reads used to assemble the L. heterotoma genome binned by their GC count vs. multiplicity (total counts among the reads). Bins are colored by the number of distinct K-mers. Different clusters are identified as shown and described in the text. (B and C): A map of 27-mer multiplicity vs. GC content of the joint assembly of the Lh 14 genome (B) to a map from the published L. clavipes genome (Bioproject: PRJNA84205) (C).Furthermore, K-mer multiplicity vs. GC content for the joint assembly of the Lh 14 genome (Figure 2B) showed a very similar heat map to that using the published assembly of L. clavipes (Figure 2C; Bioproject: PRJNA84205 (Kraaijeveld et al. 2016)). The two genomes have highly similar 27-mer/GC profiles that do not differ statistically (multivariate Cramér test statistic = 114,119, P = 0.73, number bootstrap-replicates = 1000). The L. heterotoma assembly has 27-mers with approximately twice the multiplicity of those found in L. clavipes, which may represent increased repeat content in L. heterotoma and is supported by an assembly size over 200 Mb larger than the L. clavipes genome (463 Mb vs. 255 Mb) (Kraaijeveld et al. 2016). MSEV genes are encoded in the wasp genome Using our annotation pipeline, 28,481 predicted genes were annotated. Within the annotated genes, we found 8 genes for the body color yellow, 3 major royal jelly protein (mrjp) genes, 25 odorant receptor/odorant binding protein coding genes, and 94 gene predictions for cytochrome P450. Some of these nuclear genes are not only involved in development and cellular processes, but are also included in the MSEV proteome (Table S1 and (Heavner et al. 2017)). A search of gene predictions for MSEV proteins via tBLASTn identified 325 of 407 (80%) MSEV sequences (Table 3). Of these, 153/407 (38%) had a percent identity of 95% or greater. Presence or removal of scaffolds with bacterial DNA sequences from either the separate male/female or the joint assembly did not affect this number, supporting the nuclear location of a majority of the MSEV genes. Table 3. MSEV genes found in scaffolds and predictions: Gene predictions from genome assembly scaffolds and AUGUSTUS gene predictions were searched for MSEV genes using tBLASTn. Results better than %ID >70%, E-value < 1x10−50, and query coverage > 70% were retained.

In both cases, 375/407 (92%) MSEV sequences were at least 70% complete as determined by query coverage (Table 3). Of these, 191/407 (47%) had a percent identity of 95% or greater. The scaffolds containing MSEV genes (Fig. S1A) were also compared to a random subset of scaffolds without MSEV genes (Fig S1B) for their 27-mer/GC profiles. These appeared to not differ statistically (multivariate Cramér test statistic = 3755, P = 0.80, number bootstrap-replicates = 1000), indicating that the MSEV genes lie on scaffolds that resemble the rest of the genome. Characterization of select MSEV genes We spot checked small portions of the genome for gene structure predictions of MSEV virulence protein genes SmGTPse01 (Class 2) and p40 (Class 3). For this, we sequenced PCR products of gDNA corresponding to these genes. The MSEV SmGTPase01 has prokaryotic-like GTPase domains and its gene is expected to lack introns (Heavner et al. 2017). The predicted SmGTPase01 CDS spans 936 bp, which contains the functional GTPase domain (Heavner 2018). Scaffolds from male and female genomes confirmed the absence of coding region introns (data not shown). We hypothesized that primers in 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) should amplify the exact fragment from cDNA/gDNA as template based on manual characterization of the SmGTPase01 locus (Heavner 2018) (Figure 3A). This prediction was borne out and we amplified an 873 bp fragment only from female cDNA and from both male and female gDNA (Figure 3C). The sequenced PCR products were identical to corresponding sequence within the assembly and the published transcript sequence from Goecks et al. (data not shown). Figure 3.

Black arrows indicate primer locations, light gray indicates introns, UTR regions are dark gray and labeled, exons encoding potential protein domains are labeled as shown. Cream colored regions in panel A do not have a specified domain. Diagrams were drawn using GenomeDiagram as part of the Biopython (v. 1.6) package (Pritchard et al. 2006; Cock et al. 2009). Each row in the panels A and B diagrams corresponds to approximately 1,000 bp. For primer sequences, see methods. (C and D) Ladder is Thermo Fisher MassRuler ladder. (C) PCR products for SmGTPase01 from male or female cDNA and gDNA. All products are 873 bp long. Male cDNA PCR was negative. (D) PCR products for p40 from male or female cDNA and gDNA. The expected band for p40 cDNA is 939 bp and for gDNA is 1,630 bp. Male cDNA PCR was negative. Sequence analysis of PCR amplification products confirmed gene prediction results.The p40 gene encodes a protein that is structurally similar to T3SS bacterial needle-tip proteins IpaD/SipD from Shigella and Salmonella. However, p40’s genomic sequence is expected to have introns (Heavner et al. 2017). The full p40 gene was computationally assembled and predicted within both male and female genomes. Primers designed for p40’s 5′ and 3′ UTRs (Goecks et al. 2013; Ramroop 2016) (Figure 3B), allowed amplification of p40’s 939 bp cDNA only in preparations from female wasp extracts, but gDNA bands at 1,630 bp were detected from reactions when either male or female genome was used as template, indicating the presence of introns (Figure 3D). Sequencing the cloned cDNA product from females confirmed the published cDNA sequence (Heavner et al., 2017). We also cloned and sequenced the gDNA products from male and female wasps and found the sequences to be identical (data not shown). Unlike the well-characterized Drosophila hosts, the biology and molecular-genetics of their parasitic wasps have remained relatively obscure with only recent characterizations of Leptopilina and Ganaspis spp. (Melk and Govind 1999; Colinet et al. 2013; Goecks et al. 2013; Heavner et al. 2013; Mortimer et al. 2013; Heavner et al. 2017; Di Giovanni et al. 2019). Our proteomic, transcriptomic and genomic results here expand the available information on L. heterotoma. Bioinformatics analysis of the additional MSEV proteins does not alter the initial interpretation of the original 161 proteins. Genomic sequencing and analysis of scaffolds reveals that more than 92% of the MSEV genes reside on the wasp genome. We did not find evidence for MSEV gene association with endosymbiont or commensal bacterial DNA. We suspect that the remaining ∼8% are also nuclear genes and this association will be confirmed in higher quality assemblies. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that, like other subcellular structures, MSEVs are encoded in the wasp nuclear genome. The cellular nature of Lh vesicles is likely to be shared by closely related Lv and Lb wasps. Our previous work has shown that the overall morphologies of Lh and Lv MSEVs are similar (Morales et al. 2005; Chiu et al. 2006). However, this is not the case for Lb MSEVs; different Lb strains have varying MSEV morphologies (Dupas et al. 1996; Gueguen et al. 2011; Wan et al. 2019). Interpretation of their identity also varies. For example, Di Giovanni et al. (2019) contend that MSEVs/VLPs are derived from a virus ancestral to the LbFV. Our analysis of the expanded proteomic superset does not lend strong support to this line of thinking. We did not find convincing evidence of PDV or other viral structural proteins in the Lh MSEV proteome. However, we cannot discount that MSEVs have a viral origin as our analysis is limited by the fragmentation of the genome. It is also possible that a virus related to MSEVs may not have been identified to date. Mechanistically, eukaryotic viruses and vesicles share cellular pathways involving the endomembrane systems of their cells of origin or their target cells (Nolte-‘t Hoen et al. 2016), leading to overlap in protein functionality, but not necessarily origin. Thus, at least some of the Class 1 proteins in the MSEV proteome may be central to MSEV biogenesis in the wasp or for their interactions with the host hemocytes’ endomembrane machinery despite potentially being related to viruses. It is noteworthy that energy metabolism genes appear to be involved in rapid speciation and adaptation to new environments (Gershoni et al. 2009; Lane 2009), raising the possibility that MSEV mitochondrial proteins might contribute to this process. How Lh MSEVs are functionally similar to other insect or mammalian EVs remains to be explored experimentally. Functional characterization of predicted infection and immunity Class 2 proteins should explain the immune-suppressive strategies of these wasps. RNA interference, infection assays, and other experimental strategies should make this line of inquiry feasible. Functional assignments are difficult for the unannotated Class 3 proteins. These are likely to be quite interesting, due to their different expression profiles in Lh vs. Lb and G. hookeri species. This difference in expression may stem either from cis changes in their regulatory sequences, or from absence of these genes in the Lb or G. hookeri genomes. Recent comparative genomics analysis has shown that over 40% of venom genes in the closely-related species N. vitripennis and N. giraulti have diverged significantly and up to 25% of venom genes are specific to a species (Martinson et al. 2017). A proteomic analysis of the venom genes of Leptopilina spp. and a molecular understanding of their expression will provide insights into how key activities within MSEVs evolved to parasitize the range of fruit fly hosts. A key question regarding Lh virulence proteins critical to wasp success is whether their genes reside in a discrete region of the genome like a “virulence island” found in some microbial genomes (Dobrindt et al. 2004; Gal-Mor and Finlay 2006), or whether some genes are dispersed within the genome, while others occur in one or more clusters as in wasps with PDVs (Volkoff et al. 2010; Pichon et al. 2015). More complete assemblies, scaffolded to the level of chromosomes, will describe the genome-wide distribution of these genes in Lh and related wasps. Key MSEV genes could serve as genetic markers in future studies. Comparative genomics will uncover additional gene family members of MSEV proteins in other Leptopilina wasps and enable the development of new functional genomics tools such as CRISPR-disrupted mutant alleles made in N. vitripennis (Werren et al. 2009; Siebert et al. 2015; Li et al. 2017b; Li et al. 2017a). These approaches will open new avenues for understanding the biology of this host-parasite model.",
    "discussion": "Results and Discussion The MSEV proteome superset A comparative study of the proteomes of the MSEVs from Lh 14 and Lh NY strains previously generated a list of 161 “common” MSEV proteins (Heavner et al. 2017). More than 90% of the 161 proteins are part of the Lh 14 MSEV proteome. To describe MSEVs more completely, we characterized a larger set of 407 MSEV proteins from Lh 14 (161 common and 246 Lh 14) and define this set as the Lh MSEV “super-set” (Figure 1A). Key results from annotation-based classification, analysis for signal peptide and/or transmembrane domain, and presence/absence of proteins in related wasps are summarized below and in Table S1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The superset of MSEV proteins: (A) Lh 14 MSEV proteins were annotated using BLAST2GO prior to class sorting via annotation and GO Terms. Wedges denoted as “Common,” were previously published in (Heavner et al. 2017) and represent proteins found in both Lh 14 and Lh NY MSEV proteomes. New proteins analyzed in this work are in wedges labeled “Lh 14 Only.” A majority of proteins belong to Class 1. Table S1 lists 246 proteins added to the superset Lh 14 proteome. (B) and (C) Enrichment analysis of MSEV superset shows high association with exosomes and mitochondria compared to other cellular organelles according to Vesiclepedia. –log 10 (p-value) trend shown in orange for both graphs. The p-values were calculated with the Bonferroni method. (B) Percentage of MSEV genes associated with specific cellular compartments found in Vesiclepedia, relative to all MSEV genes. Of the superset proteins, 41 and 49% are associated with mitochondria and exosomes, respectively (P = 3 × 10−57; 1 × 10−53). (C) Fold-enrichment of the MSEV dataset in specific cellular compartments. Although many protein classes are present in the proteome, exosomal and mitochondrial proteins show more significant enrichments.The presence/absence of signal peptide (SP) alone, or SP with/without the transmembrane (TM) domain(s) in MSEV proteins reveals their possible location (i.e., potentially secreted into the venom gland lumen or associated with MSEV membrane). We therefore searched the 246 Lh 14 proteins for SP and TM domains. Of the 246 proteins, 55 (22.35%) have a predicted SP domain, 37 (15.04%) have a predicted TM domain, while 6 (2.44%) have both a predicted SP and TM domain. After annotation, we found that a majority (183/246 or 75%) of the 246 proteins can be classified as core eukaryotic cell biology proteins (Class 1); 13/246 (5%) proteins as virulence- and immunity-related based on associated GO terms (Ashburner et al. 2000; The Gene Ontology Consortium 2019) (Class 2); and 50/246 or 20% as novel sequences without high confidence annotation (Class 3) (Table S1). A presence/absence analysis of these 246 proteins in published transcriptomes (Goecks et al. 2013) of Lb or a more distantly related wasp, G. hookeri (for thresholds see Methods) revealed the following: only 43/246 (17%) Lh MSEV proteins are expected to be found in Lb and/or G. hookeri (Table S1). Of these, 33/43 (77%) proteins were in Class 1 but only 7/43 (16%) and 3/43 (7%) were in Class 2 and Class 3 categories, respectively. These results support the idea that, multiple but different, infection strategies and/or host evasion strategies might exist among different wasps infecting the same hosts. While most of the Class 1 proteins were annotated as ribosomal or mitochondrial-related, a few were described as integral membrane proteins, vesicle trafficking protein SEC22b (E-value: 6.22E-145), and the ion channels sideroflexin 1 and 2 (E-value: 0). We also identified an apolipophorin (E-value: 1.02E-7) (Table S1). The presence of these membrane-associated proteins reinforces the vesicular nature of MSEVs. Examples of Class 2 proteins include the neural/ectodermal development factor IMP-L2 (E-value: 5.29x10−50) and a protein involved in pain reception, CG9231 (E-value: 4.39x10−15). A viral-like Diedel protein (E-value: 1.77x10−7), viral Enhancin (E-value: 6.02x10−5), l(2)37Cc (E-value: 3.39x10−165), odorant binding protein 56d-like (E-value: 5.64x10−50), major royal jelly protein (E-value: 8.59x10−135), and two venom acid-phosphatases Acph-1 (E-value: 4.12x10−5) were also found in the Class 2 category; their cDNA sequences were published previously (Heavner et al. 2013) (Table S1). It is possible that these MSEV proteins modulate the hosts’ immune responses and/or influence host development to facilitate successful parasitism. Within Class 3, 45 proteins (90%) lacked BLASTp and InterProScan results. However, Conserved Domain Database (CDD) (Marchler-Bauer et al. 2017) searches returned 9 hits identifying potentially functional domains (Table 1). This included (a) a CD99L2 like antigen (%ID: 24%, E-value: 3x10−3), (b) a DEAD-like helicases superfamily member (%ID: 22%, E-value 2x10−4) and (c) a herpes outer envelope glycoprotein 350 (gp350), (%ID: 28%, E-value: 4x10−3) (Table 1). Table 1. CDD-search results of MSEV “un-annotated” proteins in the super-set. MSEV ORFs that completed the BLAST2GO pipeline and did not return any results were run through the  CDD-Search Version 3.16 (Accessed: Aug. 2018).

BLASTp DELTA-BLAST of the potential gp350 domain against the nr database for Hymenoptera yielded an uncharacterized protein as the best hit (%ID: 24%, E-value: 8x10−6) in the ant Vollenhovia emeryi. This ant protein is predicted to contain calcium-binding EGF domains. The second hit in this search is from N. vitripennis for a predicted mucin-3A like glycoprotein (Gendler and Spicer 1995) (%ID: 24%, E-value: 2x10−4). Interestingly, transcripts related to the potential Lh gp350-like protein are not found in the Lb or G. hookeri transcriptomes (Table S1) (Goecks et al. 2013). Presence of this gp350-like protein in Lh MSEVs, but its absence in Lb MSEVs, suggests that it somehow contributes to differences in Lh/Lb host-parasite interactions and is therefore worthy of future studies. Complement receptor type 2 (CR2) in human B lymphocytes interacts with gp350 during Epstein-Barr infection (Young et al. 2008) and finding a verified homolog of CR2 in Drosophila hosts would be interesting in future research. Because more than 200 proteins have now been added to the previously described MSEV proteome (Heavner et al. 2017), we re-evaluated our previous enrichment analysis. In an ortholog-based comparison of the superset to human extracellular vesicle (EV) proteomes in Vesiclepedia (the most current and robust source of EV data (Kalra et al. 2012)), we found that the largest proportion of superset proteins (49%) are proteins specifically associated with exosomes (Figure 1B). In human and mouse EV proteomes, mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins are enriched (Kalra et al. 2012). Accordingly, protein components of mitochondria (e.g., respiratory chain) and ribosomes (e.g., large and small subunit proteins) are found to be highly enriched in the Lh MSEV superset. However, we found that the significance of the enrichment was higher between the superset and exosomal proteins than mitochondrial or ribosomal proteins (Figure 1C). These results demonstrate the similarities in the protein profiles of MSEVs and EVs. Do Lh MSEVs contain homologs of PDV or viral proteins? Even though figitid Leptopilina wasps are distantly related to PDV-containing Ichneumonid and Braconid wasps (Misof et al. 2014; Strand and Burke 2015), an association of PDV-like viruses in figitid wasps cannot be discounted because of shared evolutionary history. Recent publications have identified capsid-less VLPs in Ichneumonidae wasps (Volkoff et al. 2010; Pichon et al. 2015; Burke et al. 2018) and it is possible that Lh MSEVs have a similar viral origin. We therefore analyzed the Lh MSEV proteome superset against the GenBank PDV database, and then against its entire Viridae database. To identify false positives, MSEV proteins with positive PDV hits (E-values were less than 1.0x10−3, %ID was 20% or greater, and query coverage was 30% or higher) were also searched against the unrestricted nr database to compare relatedness. If an MSEV protein is similar to a viral or virus-related PDV protein, we expected that, in the unrestricted nr database search, the MSEV query sequence would align again with the same viral subject sequences, but with a lower E-value (Table S2). For PDV searches (Taxid: 10482 and Taxid: 40273), four proteins returned hits with E-values better than 1.0x10−20 and query coverage greater than 30%. Three of these hits are conserved proteins (cytochrome P450 and histone 4) while the fourth result identified an uncharacterized Cotesia congregata bracovirus (CcBV) protein (%ID: 31.08%, E-value: 1.38x10−17, query coverage: 77%) (Table S2). The unbiased BLASTp search against the entire nr database however had better results against eukaryotic proteins (E values: 0 to 2.0x10−7 and %ID from 100 to 56.25) (Table S2). In fact, the query that yielded the CcBV protein was better matched to a eukaryotic ribonuclease (%ID: 26.06%, E-value 1.14x10−16, query coverage: 84%) (Table S2). These results suggest that MSEV sequence similarities with PDV proteins may not be significant. We also searched the Lh MSEV superset for presence of L. boulardi Filamentous Virus (LbFV) homologs (LbFV is a behavior manipulating virus of Lb (Varaldi et al. 2006; Patot et al. 2012)). Of LbFV’s 108 genes, 13 are present in genomes of Lb, Lh and related species, and the 13 transcripts are expressed in the Lb venom gland (Di Giovanni et al. 2019). Within our thresholds, we obtained only three (of 13) sequences with similarity to LbFV ORFs. However, these three Lh MSEV proteins, with hits for LbFV sequences obtained better scoring hits in the unrestricted nr database, suggesting that the Lh MSEV proteins are not highly related to the LbFV proteins (Table S2). When comparing MSEV proteins to the entirety of Viridae, a total of 35 MSEV proteins had hits with %IDs ranging from 30 to 71% and E-values ranging from 1.0x10−22 to 1.0x10−178 (Table S2). However, a BLASTp search against the entire nr database found that proteins with results for viral hits had better scores when searched against the entire nr database, indicating that while viral hits are possible, they are not the best match (Table S2). This result, in addition to the fact that 372 other MSEV proteins (including the Diedel and Enhancin (Table S1)) did not return viral hits, would indicate that a majority of MSEV proteins are not closely related to viral proteins. The whole-body transcriptome contains expressed MSEV transcripts We performed a mixed-gender whole-body transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly of Lh transcripts. This assembly generated 104,066 transcripts. This dataset is more than three times larger than the published data derived from abdomens of female wasps that has 31,400 transcripts (Goecks et al. 2013). A BLAST analysis of the female abdominal transcripts against the male/female whole-body transcripts showed that a majority (21,493/31,400, 68.4%) were present in the latter data set. We searched the whole-body transcriptome for MSEV protein coding sequences using tBLASTn. Of 407 MSEV superset proteins, we identified transcripts for 371 (91.1%) proteins. Despite the ∼9% discrepancy (likely due to differences in expression levels due to different experimental conditions), these results largely verify the transcript data from (Goecks et al. 2013) that we have based our proteomic analyses on. Of the 371 MSEV transcripts identified, 233 (63%) encode Class 1, 44 (12%) encode Class 2, and 94/371 (25%) encode Class 3 proteins. Assembly of the Lh genome We separately sequenced Lh 14 male and female genomic DNA and assembled the paired-end reads de novo, using ABySS (Jackman et al. 2017). These assemblies have a modest scaffold N50 of 4,800 with more than 100,000 scaffolds and an average coverage of 87% (Table 2). Assembly with MaSurCa (Zimin et al. 2013) provided similar results (data not shown), indicating that our assembly quality is limited likely due to factors such as large genome size and repetitive sequence regions (Dominguez Del Angel et al. 2018). Although the N50 values and large number of scaffolds indicate that the genome is not highly assembled, we found at least 80% of BUSCOs shared in the Insecta set in both assemblies (Table 2, BUSCOs in Table S3). Table 2. Assembly statistics: Statistics of male, female, and combined (male plus female) Lh genomes as assessed by QUASTv4.0 and BUSCOv9.0. Percent coverage was found by mapping sequencing reads back to assembly using HISAT2. The identified BUSCOs can be found in Table S1. The QUAST program was run with parameters set for eukaryotic genomes and scaffolds. The BUSCO program was run with species set to ‘Nasonia.’ Contigs smaller than 500 bp were excluded.

The number of found BUSCOs in the joint assembly rose to 90% (Table 2, BUSCOs in Table S3). Analysis of K-mer multiplicity vs. GC content in the genome sequencing reads using the K-mer analysis tool, KAT (Mapleson et al. 2016) showed three possible clusters, although they are difficult to distinguish (Figure 2A). Cluster 1 has high multiplicity (450-650), Cluster 2 has lower multiplicity and a wide range of GC content, and Cluster 3 has the lowest multiplicity and the highest GC content. Cluster 3 overlaps with Cluster 2 making them hard to fully separate. BLAST searches of a random sample (1,672/4,482) from Cluster 1 contigs hit insect homologs 73% (1,220/1,672) of the time, Acetobacter homologs 13% (216/1,672) of the time, and then a variety of mostly Eukaryotic hits. Cluster 2 represents a majority of the wasp genome (>94%), and blast hits of a random sample (316/68,173) of its contigs almost exclusively had homologs in Hymenoptera (311/316; 98%) and mostly in L. heterotoma (227/316; 71%). Cluster 3 is the smallest of the three and contigs from Cluster 3 had homologs exclusively in Acetobacter (110/110). There was no evidence for contamination from a viral source or discrete MSEV-specific set of nucleic acid sequence. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Analysis of K-mer coverage vs. GC count.

(B and C): A map of 27-mer multiplicity vs. GC content of the joint assembly of the Lh 14 genome (B) to a map from the published L. clavipes genome (Bioproject: PRJNA84205) (C).Furthermore, K-mer multiplicity vs. GC content for the joint assembly of the Lh 14 genome (Figure 2B) showed a very similar heat map to that using the published assembly of L. clavipes (Figure 2C; Bioproject: PRJNA84205 (Kraaijeveld et al. 2016)). The two genomes have highly similar 27-mer/GC profiles that do not differ statistically (multivariate Cramér test statistic = 114,119, P = 0.73, number bootstrap-replicates = 1000). The L. heterotoma assembly has 27-mers with approximately twice the multiplicity of those found in L. clavipes, which may represent increased repeat content in L. heterotoma and is supported by an assembly size over 200 Mb larger than the L. clavipes genome (463 Mb vs. 255 Mb) (Kraaijeveld et al. 2016). MSEV genes are encoded in the wasp genome Using our annotation pipeline, 28,481 predicted genes were annotated. Within the annotated genes, we found 8 genes for the body color yellow, 3 major royal jelly protein (mrjp) genes, 25 odorant receptor/odorant binding protein coding genes, and 94 gene predictions for cytochrome P450. Some of these nuclear genes are not only involved in development and cellular processes, but are also included in the MSEV proteome (Table S1 and (Heavner et al. 2017)). A search of gene predictions for MSEV proteins via tBLASTn identified 325 of 407 (80%) MSEV sequences (Table 3). Of these, 153/407 (38%) had a percent identity of 95% or greater. Presence or removal of scaffolds with bacterial DNA sequences from either the separate male/female or the joint assembly did not affect this number, supporting the nuclear location of a majority of the MSEV genes. Table 3. MSEV genes found in scaffolds and predictions: Gene predictions from genome assembly scaffolds and AUGUSTUS gene predictions were searched for MSEV genes using tBLASTn. Results better than %ID >70%, E-value < 1x10−50, and query coverage > 70% were retained.

In both cases, 375/407 (92%) MSEV sequences were at least 70% complete as determined by query coverage (Table 3). Of these, 191/407 (47%) had a percent identity of 95% or greater. The scaffolds containing MSEV genes (Fig. S1A) were also compared to a random subset of scaffolds without MSEV genes (Fig S1B) for their 27-mer/GC profiles. These appeared to not differ statistically (multivariate Cramér test statistic = 3755, P = 0.80, number bootstrap-replicates = 1000), indicating that the MSEV genes lie on scaffolds that resemble the rest of the genome. Characterization of select MSEV genes We spot checked small portions of the genome for gene structure predictions of MSEV virulence protein genes SmGTPse01 (Class 2) and p40 (Class 3). For this, we sequenced PCR products of gDNA corresponding to these genes. The MSEV SmGTPase01 has prokaryotic-like GTPase domains and its gene is expected to lack introns (Heavner et al. 2017). The predicted SmGTPase01 CDS spans 936 bp, which contains the functional GTPase domain (Heavner 2018). Scaffolds from male and female genomes confirmed the absence of coding region introns (data not shown). We hypothesized that primers in 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) should amplify the exact fragment from cDNA/gDNA as template based on manual characterization of the SmGTPase01 locus (Heavner 2018) (Figure 3A). This prediction was borne out and we amplified an 873 bp fragment only from female cDNA and from both male and female gDNA (Figure 3C). The sequenced PCR products were identical to corresponding sequence within the assembly and the published transcript sequence from Goecks et al. (data not shown). Figure 3.

(C) PCR products for SmGTPase01 from male or female cDNA and gDNA. All products are 873 bp long. Male cDNA PCR was negative. (D) PCR products for p40 from male or female cDNA and gDNA. The expected band for p40 cDNA is 939 bp and for gDNA is 1,630 bp. Male cDNA PCR was negative. Sequence analysis of PCR amplification products confirmed gene prediction results.The p40 gene encodes a protein that is structurally similar to T3SS bacterial needle-tip proteins IpaD/SipD from Shigella and Salmonella. However, p40’s genomic sequence is expected to have introns (Heavner et al. 2017). The full p40 gene was computationally assembled and predicted within both male and female genomes. Primers designed for p40’s 5′ and 3′ UTRs (Goecks et al. 2013; Ramroop 2016) (Figure 3B), allowed amplification of p40’s 939 bp cDNA only in preparations from female wasp extracts, but gDNA bands at 1,630 bp were detected from reactions when either male or female genome was used as template, indicating the presence of introns (Figure 3D). Sequencing the cloned cDNA product from females confirmed the published cDNA sequence (Heavner et al., 2017). We also cloned and sequenced the gDNA products from male and female wasps and found the sequences to be identical (data not shown). Unlike the well-characterized Drosophila hosts, the biology and molecular-genetics of their parasitic wasps have remained relatively obscure with only recent characterizations of Leptopilina and Ganaspis spp. (Melk and Govind 1999; Colinet et al. 2013; Goecks et al. 2013; Heavner et al. 2013; Mortimer et al. 2013; Heavner et al. 2017; Di Giovanni et al. 2019). Our proteomic, transcriptomic and genomic results here expand the available information on L. heterotoma. Bioinformatics analysis of the additional MSEV proteins does not alter the initial interpretation of the original 161 proteins. Genomic sequencing and analysis of scaffolds reveals that more than 92% of the MSEV genes reside on the wasp genome. We did not find evidence for MSEV gene association with endosymbiont or commensal bacterial DNA. We suspect that the remaining ∼8% are also nuclear genes and this association will be confirmed in higher quality assemblies. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that, like other subcellular structures, MSEVs are encoded in the wasp nuclear genome. The cellular nature of Lh vesicles is likely to be shared by closely related Lv and Lb wasps. Our previous work has shown that the overall morphologies of Lh and Lv MSEVs are similar (Morales et al. 2005; Chiu et al. 2006). However, this is not the case for Lb MSEVs; different Lb strains have varying MSEV morphologies (Dupas et al. 1996; Gueguen et al. 2011; Wan et al. 2019). Interpretation of their identity also varies. For example, Di Giovanni et al. (2019) contend that MSEVs/VLPs are derived from a virus ancestral to the LbFV. Our analysis of the expanded proteomic superset does not lend strong support to this line of thinking. We did not find convincing evidence of PDV or other viral structural proteins in the Lh MSEV proteome. However, we cannot discount that MSEVs have a viral origin as our analysis is limited by the fragmentation of the genome. It is also possible that a virus related to MSEVs may not have been identified to date. Mechanistically, eukaryotic viruses and vesicles share cellular pathways involving the endomembrane systems of their cells of origin or their target cells (Nolte-‘t Hoen et al. 2016), leading to overlap in protein functionality, but not necessarily origin. Thus, at least some of the Class 1 proteins in the MSEV proteome may be central to MSEV biogenesis in the wasp or for their interactions with the host hemocytes’ endomembrane machinery despite potentially being related to viruses. It is noteworthy that energy metabolism genes appear to be involved in rapid speciation and adaptation to new environments (Gershoni et al. 2009; Lane 2009), raising the possibility that MSEV mitochondrial proteins might contribute to this process. How Lh MSEVs are functionally similar to other insect or mammalian EVs remains to be explored experimentally. Functional characterization of predicted infection and immunity Class 2 proteins should explain the immune-suppressive strategies of these wasps. RNA interference, infection assays, and other experimental strategies should make this line of inquiry feasible. Functional assignments are difficult for the unannotated Class 3 proteins. These are likely to be quite interesting, due to their different expression profiles in Lh vs. Lb and G. hookeri species. This difference in expression may stem either from cis changes in their regulatory sequences, or from absence of these genes in the Lb or G. hookeri genomes. Recent comparative genomics analysis has shown that over 40% of venom genes in the closely-related species N. vitripennis and N. giraulti have diverged significantly and up to 25% of venom genes are specific to a species (Martinson et al. 2017). A proteomic analysis of the venom genes of Leptopilina spp. and a molecular understanding of their expression will provide insights into how key activities within MSEVs evolved to parasitize the range of fruit fly hosts. A key question regarding Lh virulence proteins critical to wasp success is whether their genes reside in a discrete region of the genome like a “virulence island” found in some microbial genomes (Dobrindt et al. 2004; Gal-Mor and Finlay 2006), or whether some genes are dispersed within the genome, while others occur in one or more clusters as in wasps with PDVs (Volkoff et al. 2010; Pichon et al. 2015). More complete assemblies, scaffolded to the level of chromosomes, will describe the genome-wide distribution of these genes in Lh and related wasps. Key MSEV genes could serve as genetic markers in future studies. Comparative genomics will uncover additional gene family members of MSEV proteins in other Leptopilina wasps and enable the development of new functional genomics tools such as CRISPR-disrupted mutant alleles made in N. vitripennis (Werren et al. 2009; Siebert et al. 2015; Li et al. 2017b; Li et al. 2017a). These approaches will open new avenues for understanding the biology of this host-parasite model.",

Copyright notice ID: 6945029 PMID: 31676506 Abstract Leptopilina heterotoma are obligate parasitoid wasps that develop in the body of their Drosophila hosts. During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species. Keywords: Extracellular vesicle, whole genome sequencing, Leptopilina heterotoma, endoparasitoid wasp, Drosophila, VLP, host-parasite, organelle, immune suppression Parasitic wasps are among the most abundant insects; they are vital to biodiversity and contribute to biological control of agricultural pests (Narendran 2001; Rodriguez et al. 2013). A common strategy for reproductive success of parasitic wasps is suppression of immunity in their larval hosts. Parasitic wasps produce viruses or virus-like particles in tissues associated with the ovary. Wasps of the Ichneumonoidea superfamily produce symbiotic polydnaviruses (PDVs), which package circular dsDNA. PDV (Bracovirus (BV) in braconid wasps; Ichnovirus (IV) in ichneumonid wasps) genomes are integrated within the wasp genome as islands of viral genes. Upon oviposition, PDVs suppress host immunity. BVs and IVs derive from nudivirus and large DNA cytoplasmic viruses, respectively (reviewed in Strand and Burke 2015; Drezen et al. 2017; Gauthier et al. 2018, and references therein). Immune-suppressive virus-like particles (VLPs) (e.g., VcVLPs in the ichneumonid Venturia canescens and FaENVs in the braconid Fopius arisanus) lack proviral DNA segments, but are of viral origin and transfer virulence proteins into host cells (Pichon et al. 2015; Burke et al. 2018). Viral genes encoding VLP proteins are either dispersed in the wasp genome (as in VcVLP) or present in discrete genomic areas (as in FaENV). Thus, various independent viral endogenization events have been important for successful parasitism by these wasps (Strand and Burke 2015; Gauthier et al. 2018). Here, we focus on immune-suppressive particles of figitid wasps in the genus Leptopilina, that infect Drosophila spp. and are gaining importance as models for natural host-parasite interactions (Keebaugh and Schlenke 2014). Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh), L. victoriae (Lv), and L. boulardi (Lb) produce VLPs in their venom glands. The VLPs of Leptopilina spp. and their proteins have been linked to parasite success (Rizki et al. 1990; Dupas et al. 1996; Morales et al. 2005; Labrosse et al. 2005; Chiu et al. 2006; Heavner et al. 2014). Evidence for DNA in Leptopilina VLPs is lacking, and because of the absence of a published wasp genome, the chromosomal vs. extrachromosomal location of MSEV protein genes is not known. Our goals here are (a) to describe additional proteins in the MSEV proteome and examine their relationship with PDV and other viral proteins, and (b) determine whether MSEV genes are encoded in the wasp genome. We recently described 161 proteins in the VLPs from two Lh strains in three classes: conserved eukaryotic with cellular function (Class 1), infection- and immunity-related (Class 2), and unannotated (novel) without similarity to known proteins (Class 3) (Heavner et al. 2017). Class 1 proteins include several vesicular transport and endomembrane system proteins. Class 2 proteins include predicted modulators of immune response, e.g., metalloendopeptidases, RhoGAPs, a knottin-like protein, and a new family of prokaryotic-like GTPases whose genes lack introns. A striking example of Class 3 proteins is p40, with three-dimensional structural similarity to Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) needle-tip proteins, IpaD/SipD/BipD from Gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella, Shigella and Burkholderia. Earlier results have indicated that the p40 gene (unlike the GTPase genes) is expected to have introns. These results suggested that Lh VLPs have novel properties with elements of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic secretion systems and possess a functionally diverse array of immune-suppressive proteins. We therefore renamed VLPs as Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs). Their variable morphologies distinguish them from ordered PDV morphologies. Additionally, genes encoding abundant MSEV proteins p40 and GTPase are present even in antibiotic-treated wasps. These results favored a non-microbial nature for MSEVs (Heavner et al. 2017). Here, we present an analysis of an additional 246 proteins from the Lh 14 MSEV proteome to obtain a more comprehensive description. A combined analysis of these and previous results reinforce the idea that the MSEV proteome is enriched in exosomal proteins and that Class 3 proteins are not shared with either Lb or an unrelated Ganaspis spp. Whole-body transcriptome of adult Lh wasps validated the expression of the MSEV genes. De novo genomic assembly and analyses revealed 90% of conserved Insecta Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs), as well as a majority (375/407; ∼90%) of the MSEV proteins are encoded in the wasp genome. While we cannot rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, in aggregate, our results provide a clearer understanding of the current nature of these complex structures and strengthen the idea that specialized extracellular vesicles transfer wasp virulence factors and other parasite proteins into Drosophila host cells. Materials and Methods Insects Isogenized Lh strains New York (NY; (Chiu and Govind 2002; Chiu et al. 2006)) and Lh 14 (Schlenke et al. 2007), were raised on the y w strain of D. melanogaster that were reared on standard cornmeal, yeast, and agar fly food at 25° as described by Small et al. (2012). Adult wasps were collected from parasitized hosts, 25 days after infection at 25°. Male and female wasps were stored on fly food with 70% honey on “buzz” plugs.Analysis of MSEV super-set ORFs Previously undescribed open reading frames (ORFs) from the Lh 14 MSEV proteome and sequenced as part of Heavner et al. (2017) (PXD005632) are analyzed in the context of the published female abdominal (Goecks et al. 2013) and whole body (this study) Lh 14 transcriptomes. We have not observed any difference in venom activities of Lh 14 and Lh NY (Morales et al. 2005; Schlenke et al. 2007), or in wasp success under laboratory conditions. The Lh 14 ORFs were aligned against transcripts from BioProject: PRJNA202370, Accession number GAJC0000000 (Goecks et al. 2013) as previously described in Heavner et al. (2017). Proteins with an ORF and a transcript were run through the BLAST2GO (v 5.2; downloaded June 2018) annotation pipeline with an E-value threshold of 1x10−7 (Conesa et al. 2005; Götz et al. 2008). Results were organized and classified based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms from UniProt and InterPro (Ashburner et al. 2000; Jones et al. 2014; Uniport Consortium 2015; The Gene Ontology Consortium 2019). Proteins were considered “virulence-related” based on GO terms indicating involvement with infection, host evasion, inflammation, and immune response. ORFs that did not return results via BLAST or InterProScan (Class 3 proteins) were run through Conserved Domain Search (CDD) on  (version 3.16) (Marchler-Bauer et al. 2017). The E-value cut off for CDD search was 1x10−2. Proteins were considered to have a signal peptide if one was predicted using Phobeus and Signal P (Käll et al. 2004; Käll et al. 2007; Nielsen 2017; Almagro Armenteros et al. 2019). Transmembrane domains were considered to be present if they were predicted using Phobeus and TMHMM (Sonnhammer et al. 1998; Krogh et al. 2001; Käll et al. 2004; Käll et al. 2007). The GhostKOALA algorithm (Kanehisa et al. 2016) was used to assign KEGG ortholog (KO) numbers for the MSEV superset protein sequences. If a primary KO number failed to be assigned by GhostKOALA, a secondary number assignment with a score >= 50 was used. Redundant KO numbers were excluded. MSEV proteins were included in the enrichment analyses only if a human ortholog exists; the gene identifiers for human orthologs were obtained from the MSEV KO and the UniProt mapping utility (Li et al. 2015; Uniport Consortium 2015). (Human orthologs were chosen because a robust proportion of Vesiclepedia’s data are derived from human vesicle proteomes.) The orthologs of human genes were analyzed for enrichment with the FunRich algorithm (Pathan et al. 2015; Pathan et al. 2017) against the Vesiclepedia database (Kalra et al. 2012; Pathan et al. 2019). Finally, the MSEV proteome was used as a query using BLASTp for the following databases: “non-redundant” (nr), nr restricted to Taxid: Viridae (10239), nr restricted to Taxid: Polydnaviridae (10482), and nr restricted to Taxid: Unclassified Polydnaviridae (40273) (E-value threshold: 1.0x10−3, %ID minimum: 20%, performed 04/16/2019). tBLASTn of L. boulardi and G. hookeri (previously called Ganaspis spp. 1) (Goecks et al. 2013) transcriptomes was performed on 03/10/2019; the threshold for homologs in Lb and G. hookeri were 25% ID and an E-value of 1.0x10−10.Genomes sequencing and assembly Library preparations, sequencing reactions, and associated validations were conducted by GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Genomic DNA was extracted from ∼50 mg of tissue (∼100 wasps) of Lh males and females separately using mixed bead beating and PureLink Genomic DNA extraction kits following manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of extracted DNA was performed using Nanodrop and Qubit2.0 Fluorometer (Live Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Integrity of genomic DNA was verified by gel electrophoresis (0.6% agarose). DNA libraries were prepared for each wasp gender by acoustic shearing fragmentation using a Covaris S220. Fragments were end repaired and adenylated prior to adapter ligation on 3′ ends (NEB NextUltra DNA Library Preparation kit, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Enrichment and indexing of adapter-ligated DNA was done through limited cycle PCR. DNA library validation was performed using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Libraries were quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Real time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to quantify DNA molar mass for each library before multiplexing in equal molar mass. DNA libraries were sequenced using a 2x150 paired-end (PE) configuration on one lane on an Illumina HiSeq 4000. Image analysis and base calling were performed using the HiSeq Control Software (HCS) on the HiSeq instrument. The average size of inserts (without adaptors) in the Illumina library was ∼300-350 bp. De novo assembly of reads and scaffolding of contigs was performed using ABySS 2.2 (Jackman et al. 2017) by the New York Genome Center. De novo assembly of combined male/female genome was performed using Platanus-allee (Kajitani et al. 2019) and scaffolding was improved using AGOUTI (Zhang et al. 2016) on the University of Delaware’s BIOMIX cluster. Sequences from Drosophila-associated bacteria such as Wolbachia spp., Acetobacter pasteurianus, and Lactobacillus plantarum were identified in both assemblies. Wolbachia are endosymbionts of many insects including Leptopilina spp. (Pannebakker et al. 2004; Werren et al. 2008; Gueguen et al. 2012). Lactobacilli and Acetobacter are symbionts and commensals of sugar-consuming insects (Crotti et al. 2010; Engel and Moran 2013). Among the three bacterial species, Wolbachia sequences were the most abundant. BLASTx analysis showed that predicted genes from Wolbachia scaffolds were associated with Wolbachia proteins in GenBank. These bacterial and mitochondrial sequence-containing scaffolds were identified during the  submission process and were manually removed from the submission.Evaluation of genome assemblies Assemblies made with ABySS and Platanus-allee with AGOUTI were run through QUAST v4.0 (Mikheenko et al. 2016) to determine scaffold number, N50, and GC%. All assemblies were examined for conserved genes and orthologs with BUSCO v9 (Simão et al. 2015; Waterhouse et al. 2017) using the Insecta set and training parameters set to “Nasonia”.  BLAST+ (v 2.7.1) was used to compare selected scaffolds produced from male and female genome assemblies (Johnson et al. 2008; Camacho et al. 2009). E-value threshold was set at 1x10−7. E-values of alignments were considered acceptable if within the range of 0 to 1x10−10. K-mer analysis was performed using the K-mer Analysis Toolkit (KAT) (Mapleson et al. 2016) and heat maps were used to compare multiplicity (coverage plus repeats) of K-mers to GC content of the reads, coloring bins according to the number of distinct K-mers in each. This analysis was used to determine whether there were separate clusters of multiplicity/GC content that might arise from different sources, such as contamination. BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990; Camacho et al. 2009; Johnson et al. 2008) was used to search for homologs of a random sample of genomic scaffolds to which reads from each cluster mapped. The joint assembly of the Lh 14 genome was compared to the published L. clavipes genome (Bioproject: PRJNA84205 (Kraaijeveld et al. 2016)) through maps of 27-mer multiplicity vs. GC content. Finally, 27-mer multiplicity/GC content of the scaffolds (9.6 Mb) containing MSEV genes was compared to a random subset of scaffolds (9.6 Mb) without MSEV genes. Statistical differences between Lh 14 and L. clavipes genomes and between MSEV-gene containing scaffolds and non-MSEV-gene containing scaffolds were calculated using a multivariate Cramér test (Ihaka and Gentleman 1996; Baringhaus and Franz 2004; Franz 2019).Gene predictions, gene annotation, and viral gene searches Gene predictions were performed on parallel and anti-parallel strands using AUGUSTUS (v3.3.1; August 2018) (Stanke et al. 2004; Stanke and Morgenstern 2005; Keller et al. 2011) with the Nasonia training set. The AUGUSTUS readout was separated into mRNA, coding DNA sequence (CDS), and translations by gffread (Trapnell et al. 2012). Gene predictions were annotated by performing a BLASTx of all gene predictions against the entire nr database (Downloaded on January 2019) and InterProScan on the University of Delaware BIOMIX Cluster before using BLAST2GO (Conesa et al. 2005; Götz et al. 2008) to finish annotation based on BLASTx and InterProScan results.  BLAST+ (v 2.7.1) was used on a local machine to search predictions and scaffolds, cutoff was %ID >70%, E-value < 1E-50, and query coverage > 70%. MSEV genes and 1x10−2 for Polydnavirus and Nudivirus proteins. Family Polydnaviridae and Nudiviridae protein sequences for the 11 species available on OrthoDB v9 were downloaded on February 2019 (Johnson et al. 2008; Camacho et al. 2009).Whole-body transcriptome sequencing and assembly Total RNA extraction, library preparations, sequencing reactions, and bioinformatics analysis were conducted at GENEWIZ, INC (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). RNA was extracted from frozen tissue with the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Universal mini kit using manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The extracted RNA was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and its integrity was checked with the 4200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). RNA samples were enriched for mRNA using Oligo d(T) beads. RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The sequencing libraries were validated by using the Agilent TapeStation. Quantification was performed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems, Wilimington, MA, USA). Sequencing libraries were clustered on a single lane of a flow cell and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument using a 2x150 PE configuration. Image analysis and base calling were conducted by the HCS. Raw sequence data (.bcl files) was converted into fastq files and de-multiplexed using Illumina’s bcl2fastq 2.17 software. One mismatch was allowed for index sequence identification. The Trinity v2.5 (Grabherr et al. 2011), de novo assembler was used to assemble the Lh 14 transcripts. The de novo assembled transcriptome was created with a minimum contig length of 200 bp per sample. Transrate v1.0.3 (Smith-Unna et al. 2016) was used to generate statistics for the de novo assembled transcriptome. EMBOSS tools getorf were then used to find the ORFs within the de novo assembled transcriptome. The de novo transcriptome assembly was then annotated using Diamond BLASTx (Buchfink et al. 2015). The transcriptome reads were mapped to the genomic scaffolds for downstream analyses using HISAT2 or BWA (Li and Durbin 2009; Kim et al. 2015).Preparation of template DNA and PCR Male and female wasps (n = 12, for each sex), were separated and washed in 70% ethanol, and then rinsed twice in deionized water. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using a Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit following provided protocols. gDNA was eluted in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, and stored at 4°. The concentration of gDNA was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher). For cDNA preparation, male and female wasps (n = 12 for each sex), were separated and washed in 70% ethanol and rinsed twice in deionized water. Total body RNA was extracted using 100 µL of Trizol (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s protocols. RNA was resuspended in 0.1% DEPC treated water and treated with DNase I to remove contaminating DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RNA concentration was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher). cDNA was synthesized using Proto-Script First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs).Analysis of select genes Primers for p40 and SmGTPase01 are as follows: p40 forward: GAATCATTGTTCGTTTGCTTGAAGAAAGAATTGG p40 reverse: CATTATTAATGGGCCTTTACAATAATTTTAGCC SmGTPase01 forward: CGTTGCACTACCTTGTTTGTCA SmGTPase01 reverse: TTGTCTTTGCCCTGAGCGTT PCRs were performed with Taq polymerase (gift of C. Li lab, CCNY), PCR buffer (300 mM Tris HCl pH 9.5, 75 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM MgCl2) and deoxyribonucleotides (0.2 mM; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel in Tris acetic acid EDTA buffer (40 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 20 mM acetic acid, 1mM EDTA pH 8.0). Ethidium bromide (Sigma Aldrich)-stained gels were visualized on an ultra violet Trans-Illuminator (UVP) and gel images were taken using the DigiDocIt Imaging System (UVP). Gel images were processed in Adobe Photoshop for clarity only. gDNA or cDNA-containing PCR products were cloned into pCR TOPO II plasmids (Invitrogen) and transformed into DH10β competent cells (New England Biolabs). For plasmid preparation, colonies were screened via PCR and positive colonies were cultured in Luria Broth with ampicillin (100 µg/mL) at 37° overnight. Plasmids were extracted using Plasmid Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced (GENEWIZ, INC. South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Sequences were aligned using  BLAST+ (Johnson et al. 2008; Camacho et al. 2009) and Clustal Omega (Li et al. 2015). Expected PCR band sizes were determined using SerialCloner (v2.6.1).Data availability L. heterotoma strains (Chiu et al. 2006; Schlenke et al. 2007) are available upon request.

Supplemental material available at figshare: https://doi.org/10.25387/g3.10005260.Results and Discussion The MSEV proteome superset A comparative study of the proteomes of the MSEVs from Lh 14 and Lh NY strains previously generated a list of 161 “common” MSEV proteins (Heavner et al. 2017). More than 90% of the 161 proteins are part of the Lh 14 MSEV proteome. To describe MSEVs more completely, we characterized a larger set of 407 MSEV proteins from Lh 14 (161 common and 246 Lh 14) and define this set as the Lh MSEV “super-set” (Figure 1A). Key results from annotation-based classification, analysis for signal peptide and/or transmembrane domain, and presence/absence of proteins in related wasps are summarized below and in Table S1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The superset of MSEV proteins: (A) Lh 14 MSEV proteins were annotated using BLAST2GO prior to class sorting via annotation and GO Terms. Wedges denoted as “Common,” were previously published in (Heavner et al. 2017) and represent proteins found in both Lh 14 and Lh NY MSEV proteomes. New proteins analyzed in this work are in wedges labeled “Lh 14 Only.” A majority of proteins belong to Class 1. Table S1 lists 246 proteins added to the superset Lh 14 proteome. (B) and (C) Enrichment analysis of MSEV superset shows high association with exosomes and mitochondria compared to other cellular organelles according to Vesiclepedia. –log 10 (p-value) trend shown in orange for both graphs. The p-values were calculated with the Bonferroni method. (B) Percentage of MSEV genes associated with specific cellular compartments found in Vesiclepedia, relative to all MSEV genes. Of the superset proteins, 41 and 49% are associated with mitochondria and exosomes, respectively (P = 3 × 10−57; 1 × 10−53). (C) Fold-enrichment of the MSEV dataset in specific cellular compartments. Although many protein classes are present in the proteome, exosomal and mitochondrial proteins show more significant enrichments.The presence/absence of signal peptide (SP) alone, or SP with/without the transmembrane (TM) domain(s) in MSEV proteins reveals their possible location (i.e., potentially secreted into the venom gland lumen or associated with MSEV membrane). We therefore searched the 246 Lh 14 proteins for SP and TM domains. Of the 246 proteins, 55 (22.35%) have a predicted SP domain, 37 (15.04%) have a predicted TM domain, while 6 (2.44%) have both a predicted SP and TM domain. After annotation, we found that a majority (183/246 or 75%) of the 246 proteins can be classified as core eukaryotic cell biology proteins (Class 1); 13/246 (5%) proteins as virulence- and immunity-related based on associated GO terms (Ashburner et al. 2000; The Gene Ontology Consortium 2019) (Class 2); and 50/246 or 20% as novel sequences without high confidence annotation (Class 3) (Table S1). A presence/absence analysis of these 246 proteins in published transcriptomes (Goecks et al. 2013) of Lb or a more distantly related wasp, G. hookeri (for thresholds see Methods) revealed the following: only 43/246 (17%) Lh MSEV proteins are expected to be found in Lb and/or G. hookeri (Table S1). Of these, 33/43 (77%) proteins were in Class 1 but only 7/43 (16%) and 3/43 (7%) were in Class 2 and Class 3 categories, respectively. These results support the idea that, multiple but different, infection strategies and/or host evasion strategies might exist among different wasps infecting the same hosts. While most of the Class 1 proteins were annotated as ribosomal or mitochondrial-related, a few were described as integral membrane proteins, vesicle trafficking protein SEC22b (E-value: 6.22E-145), and the ion channels sideroflexin 1 and 2 (E-value: 0). We also identified an apolipophorin (E-value: 1.02E-7) (Table S1). The presence of these membrane-associated proteins reinforces the vesicular nature of MSEVs. Examples of Class 2 proteins include the neural/ectodermal development factor IMP-L2 (E-value: 5.29x10−50) and a protein involved in pain reception, CG9231 (E-value: 4.39x10−15). A viral-like Diedel protein (E-value: 1.77x10−7), viral Enhancin (E-value: 6.02x10−5), l(2)37Cc (E-value: 3.39x10−165), odorant binding protein 56d-like (E-value: 5.64x10−50), major royal jelly protein (E-value: 8.59x10−135), and two venom acid-phosphatases Acph-1 (E-value: 4.12x10−5) were also found in the Class 2 category; their cDNA sequences were published previously (Heavner et al. 2013) (Table S1). It is possible that these MSEV proteins modulate the hosts’ immune responses and/or influence host development to facilitate successful parasitism. Within Class 3, 45 proteins (90%) lacked BLASTp and InterProScan results. However, Conserved Domain Database (CDD) (Marchler-Bauer et al. 2017) searches returned 9 hits identifying potentially functional domains (Table 1). This included (a) a CD99L2 like antigen (%ID: 24%, E-value: 3x10−3), (b) a DEAD-like helicases superfamily member (%ID: 22%, E-value 2x10−4) and (c) a herpes outer envelope glycoprotein 350 (gp350), (%ID: 28%, E-value: 4x10−3) (Table 1). Table 1. CDD-search results of MSEV “un-annotated” proteins in the super-set. MSEV ORFs that completed the BLAST2GO pipeline and did not return any results were run through the  CDD-Search Version 3.16 (Accessed: Aug. 2018). Of 45 queries, only 9 returned hits with threshold set to 1x10−2. The ninth result came from a search with E-value threshold set to 1. Results listed are all unique, high scoring hits for each ORF that returned hits from the search.

BLASTp DELTA-BLAST of the potential gp350 domain against the nr database for Hymenoptera yielded an uncharacterized protein as the best hit (%ID: 24%, E-value: 8x10−6) in the ant Vollenhovia emeryi. This ant protein is predicted to contain calcium-binding EGF domains. The second hit in this search is from N. vitripennis for a predicted mucin-3A like glycoprotein (Gendler and Spicer 1995) (%ID: 24%, E-value: 2x10−4). Interestingly, transcripts related to the potential Lh gp350-like protein are not found in the Lb or G. hookeri transcriptomes (Table S1) (Goecks et al. 2013). Presence of this gp350-like protein in Lh MSEVs, but its absence in Lb MSEVs, suggests that it somehow contributes to differences in Lh/Lb host-parasite interactions and is therefore worthy of future studies. Complement receptor type 2 (CR2) in human B lymphocytes interacts with gp350 during Epstein-Barr infection (Young et al. 2008) and finding a verified homolog of CR2 in Drosophila hosts would be interesting in future research. Because more than 200 proteins have now been added to the previously described MSEV proteome (Heavner et al. 2017), we re-evaluated our previous enrichment analysis. In an ortholog-based comparison of the superset to human extracellular vesicle (EV) proteomes in Vesiclepedia (the most current and robust source of EV data (Kalra et al. 2012)), we found that the largest proportion of superset proteins (49%) are proteins specifically associated with exosomes (Figure 1B). In human and mouse EV proteomes, mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins are enriched (Kalra et al. 2012). Accordingly, protein components of mitochondria (e.g., respiratory chain) and ribosomes (e.g., large and small subunit proteins) are found to be highly enriched in the Lh MSEV superset. However, we found that the significance of the enrichment was higher between the superset and exosomal proteins than mitochondrial or ribosomal proteins (Figure 1C). These results demonstrate the similarities in the protein profiles of MSEVs and EVs.Do Lh MSEVs contain homologs of PDV or viral proteins? Even though figitid Leptopilina wasps are distantly related to PDV-containing Ichneumonid and Braconid wasps (Misof et al. 2014; Strand and Burke 2015), an association of PDV-like viruses in figitid wasps cannot be discounted because of shared evolutionary history. Recent publications have identified capsid-less VLPs in Ichneumonidae wasps (Volkoff et al. 2010; Pichon et al. 2015; Burke et al. 2018) and it is possible that Lh MSEVs have a similar viral origin. We therefore analyzed the Lh MSEV proteome superset against the GenBank PDV database, and then against its entire Viridae database. To identify false positives, MSEV proteins with positive PDV hits (E-values were less than 1.0x10−3, %ID was 20% or greater, and query coverage was 30% or higher) were also searched against the unrestricted nr database to compare relatedness. If an MSEV protein is similar to a viral or virus-related PDV protein, we expected that, in the unrestricted nr database search, the MSEV query sequence would align again with the same viral subject sequences, but with a lower E-value (Table S2). For PDV searches (Taxid: 10482 and Taxid: 40273), four proteins returned hits with E-values better than 1.0x10−20 and query coverage greater than 30%. Three of these hits are conserved proteins (cytochrome P450 and histone 4) while the fourth result identified an uncharacterized Cotesia congregata bracovirus (CcBV) protein (%ID: 31.08%, E-value: 1.38x10−17, query coverage: 77%) (Table S2). The unbiased BLASTp search against the entire nr database however had better results against eukaryotic proteins (E values: 0 to 2.0x10−7 and %ID from 100 to 56.25) (Table S2). In fact, the query that yielded the CcBV protein was better matched to a eukaryotic ribonuclease (%ID: 26.06%, E-value 1.14x10−16, query coverage: 84%) (Table S2). These results suggest that MSEV sequence similarities with PDV proteins may not be significant. We also searched the Lh MSEV superset for presence of L. boulardi Filamentous Virus (LbFV) homologs (LbFV is a behavior manipulating virus of Lb (Varaldi et al. 2006; Patot et al. 2012)). Of LbFV’s 108 genes, 13 are present in genomes of Lb, Lh and related species, and the 13 transcripts are expressed in the Lb venom gland (Di Giovanni et al. 2019). Within our thresholds, we obtained only three (of 13) sequences with similarity to LbFV ORFs. However, these three Lh MSEV proteins, with hits for LbFV sequences obtained better scoring hits in the unrestricted nr database, suggesting that the Lh MSEV proteins are not highly related to the LbFV proteins (Table S2). When comparing MSEV proteins to the entirety of Viridae, a total of 35 MSEV proteins had hits with %IDs ranging from 30 to 71% and E-values ranging from 1.0x10−22 to 1.0x10−178 (Table S2). However, a BLASTp search against the entire nr database found that proteins with results for viral hits had better scores when searched against the entire nr database, indicating that while viral hits are possible, they are not the best match (Table S2). This result, in addition to the fact that 372 other MSEV proteins (including the Diedel and Enhancin (Table S1)) did not return viral hits, would indicate that a majority of MSEV proteins are not closely related to viral proteins.The whole-body transcriptome contains expressed MSEV transcripts We performed a mixed-gender whole-body transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly of Lh transcripts. This assembly generated 104,066 transcripts. This dataset is more than three times larger than the published data derived from abdomens of female wasps that has 31,400 transcripts (Goecks et al. 2013). A BLAST analysis of the female abdominal transcripts against the male/female whole-body transcripts showed that a majority (21,493/31,400, 68.4%) were present in the latter data set. We searched the whole-body transcriptome for MSEV protein coding sequences using tBLASTn. Of 407 MSEV superset proteins, we identified transcripts for 371 (91.1%) proteins. Despite the ∼9% discrepancy (likely due to differences in expression levels due to different experimental conditions), these results largely verify the transcript data from (Goecks et al. 2013) that we have based our proteomic analyses on. Of the 371 MSEV transcripts identified, 233 (63%) encode Class 1, 44 (12%) encode Class 2, and 94/371 (25%) encode Class 3 proteins.Assembly of the Lh genome We separately sequenced Lh 14 male and female genomic DNA and assembled the paired-end reads de novo, using ABySS (Jackman et al. 2017). These assemblies have a modest scaffold N50 of 4,800 with more than 100,000 scaffolds and an average coverage of 87% (Table 2). Assembly with MaSurCa (Zimin et al. 2013) provided similar results (data not shown), indicating that our assembly quality is limited likely due to factors such as large genome size and repetitive sequence regions (Dominguez Del Angel et al. 2018). Although the N50 values and large number of scaffolds indicate that the genome is not highly assembled, we found at least 80% of BUSCOs shared in the Insecta set in both assemblies (Table 2, BUSCOs in Table S3). Table 2. Assembly statistics: Statistics of male, female, and combined (male plus female) Lh genomes as assessed by QUASTv4.0 and BUSCOv9.0. Percent coverage was found by mapping sequencing reads back to assembly using HISAT2. The identified BUSCOs can be found in Table S1. The QUAST program was run with parameters set for eukaryotic genomes and scaffolds. The BUSCO program was run with species set to ‘Nasonia.’ Contigs smaller than 500 bp were excluded.

The number of found BUSCOs in the joint assembly rose to 90% (Table 2, BUSCOs in Table S3). Analysis of K-mer multiplicity vs. GC content in the genome sequencing reads using the K-mer analysis tool, KAT (Mapleson et al. 2016) showed three possible clusters, although they are difficult to distinguish (Figure 2A). Cluster 1 has high multiplicity (450-650), Cluster 2 has lower multiplicity and a wide range of GC content, and Cluster 3 has the lowest multiplicity and the highest GC content. Cluster 3 overlaps with Cluster 2 making them hard to fully separate. BLAST searches of a random sample (1,672/4,482) from Cluster 1 contigs hit insect homologs 73% (1,220/1,672) of the time, Acetobacter homologs 13% (216/1,672) of the time, and then a variety of mostly Eukaryotic hits. Cluster 2 represents a majority of the wasp genome (>94%), and blast hits of a random sample (316/68,173) of its contigs almost exclusively had homologs in Hymenoptera (311/316; 98%) and mostly in L. heterotoma (227/316; 71%). Cluster 3 is the smallest of the three and contigs from Cluster 3 had homologs exclusively in Acetobacter (110/110). There was no evidence for contamination from a viral source or discrete MSEV-specific set of nucleic acid sequence. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Analysis of K-mer coverage vs. GC count. (A) Analysis of genomic reads. 27-mers generated from the cleaned Illumina reads used to assemble the L. heterotoma genome binned by their GC count vs. multiplicity (total counts among the reads). Bins are colored by the number of distinct K-mers. Different clusters are identified as shown and described in the text. (B and C): A map of 27-mer multiplicity vs. GC content of the joint assembly of the Lh 14 genome (B) to a map from the published L. clavipes genome (Bioproject: PRJNA84205) (C).Furthermore, K-mer multiplicity vs. GC content for the joint assembly of the Lh 14 genome (Figure 2B) showed a very similar heat map to that using the published assembly of L. clavipes (Figure 2C; Bioproject: PRJNA84205 (Kraaijeveld et al. 2016)). The two genomes have highly similar 27-mer/GC profiles that do not differ statistically (multivariate Cramér test statistic = 114,119, P = 0.73, number bootstrap-replicates = 1000). The L. heterotoma assembly has 27-mers with approximately twice the multiplicity of those found in L. clavipes, which may represent increased repeat content in L. heterotoma and is supported by an assembly size over 200 Mb larger than the L. clavipes genome (463 Mb vs. 255 Mb) (Kraaijeveld et al. 2016).MSEV genes are encoded in the wasp genome Using our annotation pipeline, 28,481 predicted genes were annotated. Within the annotated genes, we found 8 genes for the body color yellow, 3 major royal jelly protein (mrjp) genes, 25 odorant receptor/odorant binding protein coding genes, and 94 gene predictions for cytochrome P450. Some of these nuclear genes are not only involved in development and cellular processes, but are also included in the MSEV proteome (Table S1 and (Heavner et al. 2017)). A search of gene predictions for MSEV proteins via tBLASTn identified 325 of 407 (80%) MSEV sequences (Table 3). Of these, 153/407 (38%) had a percent identity of 95% or greater. Presence or removal of scaffolds with bacterial DNA sequences from either the separate male/female or the joint assembly did not affect this number, supporting the nuclear location of a majority of the MSEV genes. Table 3. MSEV genes found in scaffolds and predictions: Gene predictions from genome assembly scaffolds and AUGUSTUS gene predictions were searched for MSEV genes using tBLASTn. Results better than %ID >70%, E-value < 1x10−50, and query coverage > 70% were retained.

In both cases, 375/407 (92%) MSEV sequences were at least 70% complete as determined by query coverage (Table 3). Of these, 191/407 (47%) had a percent identity of 95% or greater. The scaffolds containing MSEV genes (Fig. S1A) were also compared to a random subset of scaffolds without MSEV genes (Fig S1B) for their 27-mer/GC profiles. These appeared to not differ statistically (multivariate Cramér test statistic = 3755, P = 0.80, number bootstrap-replicates = 1000), indicating that the MSEV genes lie on scaffolds that resemble the rest of the genome.Characterization of select MSEV genes We spot checked small portions of the genome for gene structure predictions of MSEV virulence protein genes SmGTPse01 (Class 2) and p40 (Class 3). For this, we sequenced PCR products of gDNA corresponding to these genes. The MSEV SmGTPase01 has prokaryotic-like GTPase domains and its gene is expected to lack introns (Heavner et al. 2017). The predicted SmGTPase01 CDS spans 936 bp, which contains the functional GTPase domain (Heavner 2018). Scaffolds from male and female genomes confirmed the absence of coding region introns (data not shown). We hypothesized that primers in 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) should amplify the exact fragment from cDNA/gDNA as template based on manual characterization of the SmGTPase01 locus (Heavner 2018) (Figure 3A). This prediction was borne out and we amplified an 873 bp fragment only from female cDNA and from both male and female gDNA (Figure 3C). The sequenced PCR products were identical to corresponding sequence within the assembly and the published transcript sequence from Goecks et al. (data not shown). Figure 3.

Black arrows indicate primer locations, light gray indicates introns, UTR regions are dark gray and labeled, exons encoding potential protein domains are labeled as shown. Cream colored regions in panel A do not have a specified domain. Diagrams were drawn using GenomeDiagram as part of the Biopython (v. 1.6) package (Pritchard et al. 2006; Cock et al. 2009). Each row in the panels A and B diagrams corresponds to approximately 1,000 bp. For primer sequences, see methods. (C and D) Ladder is Thermo Fisher MassRuler ladder. (C) PCR products for SmGTPase01 from male or female cDNA and gDNA. All products are 873 bp long. Male cDNA PCR was negative. (D) PCR products for p40 from male or female cDNA and gDNA. The expected band for p40 cDNA is 939 bp and for gDNA is 1,630 bp. Male cDNA PCR was negative. Sequence analysis of PCR amplification products confirmed gene prediction results.The p40 gene encodes a protein that is structurally similar to T3SS bacterial needle-tip proteins IpaD/SipD from Shigella and Salmonella. However, p40’s genomic sequence is expected to have introns (Heavner et al. 2017). The full p40 gene was computationally assembled and predicted within both male and female genomes. Primers designed for p40’s 5′ and 3′ UTRs (Goecks et al. 2013; Ramroop 2016) (Figure 3B), allowed amplification of p40’s 939 bp cDNA only in preparations from female wasp extracts, but gDNA bands at 1,630 bp were detected from reactions when either male or female genome was used as template, indicating the presence of introns (Figure 3D). Sequencing the cloned cDNA product from females confirmed the published cDNA sequence (Heavner et al., 2017). We also cloned and sequenced the gDNA products from male and female wasps and found the sequences to be identical (data not shown). Unlike the well-characterized Drosophila hosts, the biology and molecular-genetics of their parasitic wasps have remained relatively obscure with only recent characterizations of Leptopilina and Ganaspis spp. (Melk and Govind 1999; Colinet et al. 2013; Goecks et al. 2013; Heavner et al. 2013; Mortimer et al. 2013; Heavner et al. 2017; Di Giovanni et al. 2019). Our proteomic, transcriptomic and genomic results here expand the available information on L. heterotoma. Bioinformatics analysis of the additional MSEV proteins does not alter the initial interpretation of the original 161 proteins. Genomic sequencing and analysis of scaffolds reveals that more than 92% of the MSEV genes reside on the wasp genome. We did not find evidence for MSEV gene association with endosymbiont or commensal bacterial DNA. We suspect that the remaining ∼8% are also nuclear genes and this association will be confirmed in higher quality assemblies. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that, like other subcellular structures, MSEVs are encoded in the wasp nuclear genome. The cellular nature of Lh vesicles is likely to be shared by closely related Lv and Lb wasps. Our previous work has shown that the overall morphologies of Lh and Lv MSEVs are similar (Morales et al. 2005; Chiu et al. 2006). However, this is not the case for Lb MSEVs; different Lb strains have varying MSEV morphologies (Dupas et al. 1996; Gueguen et al. 2011; Wan et al. 2019). Interpretation of their identity also varies. For example, Di Giovanni et al. (2019) contend that MSEVs/VLPs are derived from a virus ancestral to the LbFV. Our analysis of the expanded proteomic superset does not lend strong support to this line of thinking. We did not find convincing evidence of PDV or other viral structural proteins in the Lh MSEV proteome. However, we cannot discount that MSEVs have a viral origin as our analysis is limited by the fragmentation of the genome. It is also possible that a virus related to MSEVs may not have been identified to date. Mechanistically, eukaryotic viruses and vesicles share cellular pathways involving the endomembrane systems of their cells of origin or their target cells (Nolte-‘t Hoen et al. 2016), leading to overlap in protein functionality, but not necessarily origin. Thus, at least some of the Class 1 proteins in the MSEV proteome may be central to MSEV biogenesis in the wasp or for their interactions with the host hemocytes’ endomembrane machinery despite potentially being related to viruses. It is noteworthy that energy metabolism genes appear to be involved in rapid speciation and adaptation to new environments (Gershoni et al. 2009; Lane 2009), raising the possibility that MSEV mitochondrial proteins might contribute to this process. How Lh MSEVs are functionally similar to other insect or mammalian EVs remains to be explored experimentally. Functional characterization of predicted infection and immunity Class 2 proteins should explain the immune-suppressive strategies of these wasps. RNA interference, infection assays, and other experimental strategies should make this line of inquiry feasible. Functional assignments are difficult for the unannotated Class 3 proteins. These are likely to be quite interesting, due to their different expression profiles in Lh vs. Lb and G. hookeri species. This difference in expression may stem either from cis changes in their regulatory sequences, or from absence of these genes in the Lb or G. hookeri genomes. Recent comparative genomics analysis has shown that over 40% of venom genes in the closely-related species N. vitripennis and N. giraulti have diverged significantly and up to 25% of venom genes are specific to a species (Martinson et al. 2017). A proteomic analysis of the venom genes of Leptopilina spp. and a molecular understanding of their expression will provide insights into how key activities within MSEVs evolved to parasitize the range of fruit fly hosts. A key question regarding Lh virulence proteins critical to wasp success is whether their genes reside in a discrete region of the genome like a “virulence island” found in some microbial genomes (Dobrindt et al. 2004; Gal-Mor and Finlay 2006), or whether some genes are dispersed within the genome, while others occur in one or more clusters as in wasps with PDVs (Volkoff et al. 2010; Pichon et al. 2015). More complete assemblies, scaffolded to the level of chromosomes, will describe the genome-wide distribution of these genes in Lh and related wasps. Key MSEV genes could serve as genetic markers in future studies. Comparative genomics will uncover additional gene family members of MSEV proteins in other Leptopilina wasps and enable the development of new functional genomics tools such as CRISPR-disrupted mutant alleles made in N. vitripennis (Werren et al. 2009; Siebert et al. 2015; Li et al. 2017b; Li et al. 2017a). These approaches will open new avenues for understanding the biology of this host-parasite model.Acknowledgments We thank Drs. W. Qiu and S. Singh, and J.

    "abstract": "Abstract While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized. Subject terms: Infection, Innate immunity, Microbiology",
    "introduction": "Introduction As space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is considerable interest in understanding the changes in human physiology under spaceflight conditions. Spaceflight includes not only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation, isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous studies have demonstrated that these stressors have a significant impact on the ability of the immune system to respond appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production,1–5 changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution4,6,7 and general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and adaptive immune systems.8,9 This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important when considering that there have been studies demonstrating significant effects of microgravity and spaceflight conditions on the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats.10–17 Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have been shown to have increased growth in spaceflight,18,19 increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence.20,21 Investigations of the effects of spaceflight in humans have been especially varied, likely due to both low sample sizes and variability in experimental methodology.22 The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a promising model for understanding the effects of spaceflight on human immunity and pathogenesis, as they have been shown previously to experience a dramatic shift in immune gene expression following spaceflight.23,24 Using invertebrate models for investigating the human immune system has proven both fruitful and convenient, as they are cost-effective, have short generation times, and importantly, have immune systems with high homology to humans.25,26 While invertebrates lack a characterized adaptive immune system, the inducible innate immune response of Drosophila melanogaster is highly similar to humans,25,27,28 with about 75% of human disease-causing genes with a functional homolog in the fruit fly.25,29 The human opportunistic bacteria Serratia marcescens has only recently emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports.30,31 Furthermore, S. marcescens has been found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station (ISS),32,33 suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens. D. melanogaster has been recently used as a model for studying S. marcescens, as there are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught flies that are pathogenic.34–38 Importantly, the specific strains used in this study are not pathogenic to humans,34 making this system an ideal model for safely studying spaceflight-induced changes to S. marcescens using a model system. Studies in true spaceflight conditions are difficult to perform due to cost, limited availability of launches and crew time, and the complexity of experimental design under the tight volumetric and mass constraints of space habitats. Consequently, many studies on the effects of spaceflight on bacteria are also followed up with ground-based simulated microgravity experiments,16,17,39 which allows for further investigation into microgravity-related effects. In this study, the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens was sent to the ISS, where it was exposed to true spaceflight conditions, while ground-based strains were used in tandem both as controls and as replicates grown in simulated microgravity conditions (rotating wall vessel (RWV) apparatus) in order to investigate whether changes in bacterial physiology could be replicated accurately in future ground-based studies. In our study, space-flown or simulated microgravity-treated bacteria were used to infect D. melanogaster to investigate changes in space-induced lethality, both in wild-type flies, as well as in immune pathway mutants. Results showed that both space-flown and ground-based microgravity simulations (e.g., low-shear modeled microgravity or LSMMG treatment) resulted in increased virulence of Serratia marcescens on D. melanogaster hosts. Interestingly, the increased virulence phenotype is lost after passaging of the space-flown and LSMMG-treated bacteria under ground conditions. Taken together, this suggests that spaceflight induces a physiological change in the pathogen resulting in the decreased survivability of the D. melanogaster host and that this effect can be reversed after the bacterial cells resume normal growth on the ground.",

    "results": "Results Survival of D. melanogaster after infection with spaceflight samples Fly survival was significantly lower when infected with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens samples compared to the ground control bacterial samples (Fig. 1). For the first spaceflight sample (Space 1), survival was significantly different from both Ground 1 (P < 0.0001) and Ground 2 (P < 0.0001) samples. The same was true for the second spaceflight isolate (Space 2) when compared with ground control samples. Full statistical results are reported in Table 1. Space 1 and Space 2 were separate samples of bacteria collected from two different plates after spaceflight, and both showed increased virulence compared to ground control bacteria. However they also showed differences between each other in terms of the magnitude of their changes with Space 1 causing greater virulence changes compared to Space 2 samples. This is discussed later in the context of temporary/reversible physiological changes induced by spaceflight vs genetic/heritable changes in the bacteria (see below for “Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample”).

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2 In vivo growth of spaceflight S. marcescens in fly host after injection In vivo growth of injected bacteria was not significantly different between space and ground samples at hours 0 (F = 0.9113, P = 0.489), 6 (F = 0.5316, P = 0.6772) or 9 (F = 1.169, P = 0.3964) post-injection. At hour 12 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 sample was significantly higher in the fly host than the Ground sample (P = 0.0002) and Space 2 (P = 0.0011). At hour 15 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 remained significantly higher than Ground (P = 0.0002) and Space 2 (P = 0.04), and Space 2 in vivo growth was significantly higher than Ground (P = 0.006) (Fig. 1b). Therefore, the kinetics of bacterial growth within the host are different for the bacterial cultures returning from space compared to the ground control samples, particularly 12 h and onwards post-infection. In vitro growth of the space-flown bacteria, outside the host, show a similar increase in growth kinetics at later time points compared to the ground control bacteria (Supplementary Fig. 1). Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample Given that two separate isolates of bacteria had shown increased virulence after spaceflight exposure (Fig. 1), we wanted to assess whether these changes were reversible physiological changes in the bacteria induced by the stress of spaceflight or whether they were genetically heritable changes induced, for instance, by ionizing radiation exposure during spaceflight. After subculturing spaceflight and ground samples of S. marcescens in normal Earth gravity overnight, Space 1-injected host survival was not significantly different from either Ground 1 (P = 0.995) or Ground 2 (P = 0.337) host injected samples. Similarly, Space 2 subculture-infected hosts did not show significant differences in survival from Ground 1 (P = 0.5223) or Ground 2 (P = 0.113) infected hosts (Fig. 2a). Full statistical output is reported in Table 2. These results suggest that the increased virulence detected after spaceflight were temporary changes acquired by the bacteria during spaceflight and that after subculturing under normal conditions on Earth, these differences were no longer detectable after infection of fruit fly hosts.

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2 In vivo growth after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample There was no significant difference of in vivo growth of the spaceflight vs ground bacteria within the host (Fig. 2b) at hours 0 (F = 13.41, P = 0.146), 9 (F = 0.238, P = 0.866), 12 (F = 0.443, P = 0.731) or 15 (F = 0.479, P = 0.708) hours post-infection. This data was consistent with the fact that there were no differences detected in virulence of the first ground subcultures in the host (Fig. 2a). Host survival after injection with LSMMG-treated bacteria Since spaceflight opportunities are relatively infrequent, a model that has often been used on the ground to simulate microgravity conditions for aqueous cultures is the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) or the RWV.15,17,39 We used the RWV apparatus to assess whether we could recreate some or all of the virulence changes that we had measured from the spaceflight samples by simulating the low fluid shear of the microgravity environment on Earth. This is done by rotating the vessel in a perpendicular orientation, where the rotation of the apparatus offsets the sedimental effects of the gravity force and provides continual suspension of the cells. In the control, the axis of rotation is parallel with the gravity force vector and as such, this force is not offset and the cells are allowed to settle.11,13 Host survival was significantly lower for hosts infected with S. marcescens that was grown in LSMMG compared to both the PBS Sham (ratio = 4.42, P < 0.0001) and the RWV Control (Ratio = 3.37, P = 0.0002) (Fig. 3a). The RWV Control consists of the same container as is used to simulate microgravity but is rotated about an axis that is oriented at 90 degrees to the LSMMG rotation and is therefore exposed to 1 g Earth’s gravity.11 Figure 3a therefore shows that we are able to recreate increased virulence in S. marcescens bacteria by simulating microgravity on Earth. This would suggest that the microgravity aspect of the spaceflight environment is at least one important factor to consider in terms of increased virulence in S. marcescens. Fig. 3. Simulated microgravity (SMG) can increase virulence of S. marcescens.

Error bars represent one standard error. In vivo growth of LSMMG S. marcescens There was no significant difference of in vivo growth between the LSMMG and RWV-Control bacteria at hour 0 (F = 3.551, P = 0.128) or at hour 6 post-infection (F = 7.493, P = 0.0544). However, there was a significant difference in CFU counts per fly between the LSMMG and RWV-Control at hours 9 (F = 20.428, P = 0.008), 12 (F = 12.455, P = 0.019), and 15 (F = 18.427, P = 0.009) post-infection (Fig. 3b). These altered growth kinetics also mirror some of the differences observed previously with the spaceflight samples (Fig. 1b), where the bacterial samples that show increased virulence, also show increased rates of growth within the host particularly at later time points. Infection of Immune Deficiency (Imd) and Toll pathway mutants of D. melanogaster Since the increase in virulence of spaceflight bacteria was accompanied by an increase in the rate of growth of the bacteria within the fly host, we wanted to determine whether this was a result of a change that the bacteria were able to induce in the host by weakening the hosts’ immune system for example, or whether the bacterial physiology was altered to better withstand the host’s immune defenses. In order to test this hypothesis, we used flies that were mutant in two of the major immune defense pathways in flies, the Imd and the Toll pathways.40,41 As expected, all Imd mutant flies (PGRP-LCΔ5, imd1, and relishE20) succumb to any Sm infections (including ground control Sm) much more quickly than either of the wild-type fly lines (y1w* or w1118) as seen in Fig. 4a, since the Imd pathway is known to be critical for defense against infection with Gram-negative bacteria,42 such as Serratia marcescens. On the other hand, the Toll pathway is primarily known to be important for defense against Gram-positive bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore as expected, there is much less change in the viability of Toll deficient mutants (PGRP-SAseml and dif1) after ground control Sm infections compared to wild-type flies (Fig. 4c). Compared to ground control Sm however, the spaceflight bacteria Space 1 causes greater lethality in all of the fly lines (compare Fig. 4b vs a, and 4d vs c). Therefore the data suggests that regardless of the genotype of the fly host, whether impaired for immune function or robust wild-type lines, the space-flown bacteria causes greater lethality than ground control Sm. The statistical output is shown in Supplementary Tables 2–6. Fig. 4. Measuring host changes in wild-type and mutant ground flies exposed to space-flown S. marcescens. Open in a new tab Survival curves of Imd pathway mutant flies, a and b, and of Toll pathway mutant flies, c and d, after exposure to either Ground 1 bacteria, a and c, or Space 1 bacteria, b and d. All graphs have data from two wild-type flies (y1w* and w1118) for reference. e Volcano plot of the RNA-seq data from ground-reared wild-type D. melanogaster that were infected with space bacteria relative to ground bacteria. RNA was extracted from infected flies 18 h post-infection. The x-axis represents the beta-value, an estimator of fold change, and the y-axis represents the −log10q value, a p-value adjusted for false discovery rate. Red dots represent transcripts with q-value < 0.05, which are considered significantly differentially expressed. f PCA of ground, space, and sham injected flies shows no major difference in distribution of the groups between the conditions, with as much variation occurring within conditions as between conditions. RNA sequencing data analysis of infected ground-reared host To further test whether infection with microgravity-treated bacteria induced changes in gene expression in the ground-reared host, RNA sequencing was performed for wild-type fruit flies after infection with either spaceflight or ground control sample of S. marcescens. These results showed that there were few significant changes in host gene expression of known immune-related genes when exposed to the two bacterial sample types (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Table 1). At the significance threshold (q-values < 0.05), only eleven transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. However principal components analysis (PCA) comparing transcript abundance across the treatments showed that there is significant overlap among the groups, further indicating that there are few differences between the space bacteria-infected and ground bacteria-infected fruit fly hosts (Fig. 4f). It is worth noting that, since the flies collected for RNA-Seq were still alive at 18 h post-injection, this may have biased the selection of flies in which infection had not greatly progressed, as they were still alive at this late time point. Similarity in gene expression across both conditions to a control sham condition shown by PCA supports this idea. Comparing the space bacteria-infected ground flies to the ground bacteria-infected flies, there were a total of 11 differentially expressed genes (see Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 1 for gene details). Out of these 11 differentially expressed genes, only AttA (Attacin-A) is known to be directly related to the immune response.43 The gene AttA is an antimicrobial peptide that is expressed in the fat body in response to Gram-negative pathogens.43 The most highly overexpressed gene is lola (longitudinals lacking), a gene that is involved in axon growth and guidance in the central and peripheral nervous systems.44 The next most highly overexpressed gene is vsg (visgun), a gene linked to alcohol sensitivity.45 Among the most underexpressed genes is eEF2, is a translation elongation factor,46 and CG31650 with unknown function. The underexpressed RhoGEF2 has been recently linked to wound repair, but is primarily involved in the regulation of actin and myosin dynamics through interacting effector proteins.47 While only one of these genes is directly related to the host immune pathway, follow-up studies will be conducted to elucidate the potential role of these additional differentially expressed genes in the host.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we found that flies infected with a bacterial pathogen that had been grown during spaceflight was significantly more lethal than ground controls (Fig. 1). This trend persisted in strains that had been grown in LSMMG conditions, suggesting that microgravity may be the primary factor mediating the differences in virulence seen in the spaceflight bacteria strains (Fig. 3). Interestingly, this increased lethality disappears after the first subculture is conducted on the ground, which means that the differences in virulence are short-lived and do not persist after being cultured under normal gravity conditions (Fig. 2). This is consistent with previous studies, which found that spaceflight-induced changes to pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus reverted upon return to Earth conditions.10 We also sought to understand whether the host immune system may be responding differently to spaceflight-altered bacteria. While it has been shown in previous studies that space-flown pathogens decrease the survival of hosts compared to their ground-reared counterparts,15,16 less is known about how the host immune system may be influenced differently by space-flown pathogens. This is also the first study in spaceflight and in simulated microgravity to evaluate microgravity-induced changes of the pathogen S. marcescens in a live host, as previous studies in the field of host-pathogen interactions have focused primarily on Salmonella15 and other microbes.48–50 Utilizing common immune pathway mutants, we determined that regardless of whether the Imd or Toll pathways were altered, infection with spaceflight sample decreases survival of flies compared to infection with ground sample of S. marcescens (Fig. 4). Studies in spaceflight and modeled microgravity have shown that when the host is exposed to microgravity conditions, the immune responses can be altered by the presence of symbiotic bacteria.51 Other studies have shown that when different pathogens are exposed to LSMMG and then tested on naive hosts, responses can vary widely depending on the specific pathogen used.52 Similarly in our study with ground-reared fly host, while there appear to be few genes that are differentially expressed after injection with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens compared to the ground control bacteria, most of the highly differentially regulated genes do not appear to be directly immune-related, with the exception of Attacin (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 1). This antimicrobial peptide is known to respond to Gram-negative pathogens,43 so an increase in expression in response to S. marcescens is expected. However, the increase in expression in space-infected flies compared to ground-infected flies may be due to the increase in bacterial load in the space-infected individuals. Because there is a significant increase of in vivo growth seen in both spaceflight samples and LSMMG samples, it may be possible that some of these host genes may have an unknown interaction with the immune system that facilitates the faster proliferation of microgravity-experienced bacteria after infection. However given that the space-flown bacteria have faster growth kinetics in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1) as well as in vivo, the current results indicate that the differences in lethality and survival following infection of bacteria altered by spaceflight and LSMMG are likely due to changes to the pathogen, rather than a difference in host immune response of ground-reared flies. This study is the first to demonstrate that spaceflight influences the growth and virulence characteristics of bacteria grown on a solid substrate. While many previous studies have shown that cell density and growth characteristics are altered in liquid suspension during spaceflight (reviewed in Huang et al.,53) the few studies that have cultured microbes on solid media found no difference in final cell density.54 Therefore, it was concluded that because there is no change in gravity vector for bacteria that are attached to a surface compared to those in a liquid suspension where there would be a lack of convection, that one should not expect to see a change in phenotype associated with growth on solid media in spaceflight. This argument is based on the idea that the bacteria are being affected indirectly by microgravity, due to the change in the physical properties of the liquid media that they are in, and not the effect of a change in gravity vector on the microbes themselves.55 However, Serratia marcescens is a nosocomial pathogen that can colonize a wide variety of habitats, and undergo significant phenotypic shifts depending on the properties of the growth media,56–58 including shifts in the polarity of the flagella on solid media to produce swarming cells. Because it’s thought that LSMMG may influence cell polarity in some single-celled organisms, it’s at least theoretically possible that some of these species may still be affected by microgravity at the cellular level, even on a solid substrate.59 A previous study showed that growth of E.coli and B.subtilis on agar in spaceflight did not show increased growth rates, and they did not measure virulence phenotypes of the samples.54 Therefore, it is possible that changes in phenotype in space can be manifested differently in different bacteria depending on the inherent characteristics required to colonize their normal habitat. While Wang et al.60 showed that S. marcescens did not change in physical properties on a semi-solid media in spaceflight conditions, they did provide evidence that significant transcriptomic and proteomic changes related to metabolism occurred in spaceflight sample compared to ground. We believe that these molecular and biological changes observed in S. marcescens on a semi-solid media in spaceflight provide a basis for the phenotypic changes observed in our study with bacteria grown on solid semi-defined media. While there was insufficient bacterial sample to conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in the current study, a subsequent spaceflight experiment in our lab has been conducted with S. marcescens to further characterize molecular changes on both solid and liquid media types in space and will be reported separately. This indicates that media type should not be limited to liquid suspension, and that further studies using both solid and liquid media types is warranted. A study performed with a different strain of S. marcescens (ATCC 14041) in LSMMG in liquid media showed that while there was no significant change in growth parameters, there was an increase in acid stress resistance, providing further evidence for phenotypic changes of this species to microgravity and LSMMG.61 Ongoing work in our lab, including more in-depth characterization of S. marcescens under LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, are currently being conducted to further elucidate the potential molecular and physiological mechanisms affecting growth kinetics and changes in virulence seen in altered gravity. A previous study found that growth rate was not a major factor affecting the physiology and virulence of one strain S. marcescens,62 but there is speculation that growth rate and virulence may be linked due to common factors that influence both characteristics.63,64 Recent studies in humans demonstrated that slower growth rates of Bacillus pathogens actually predicted higher virulence,65 suggesting that there is conflicting data that likely varies by species and environmental factors and that growth rates may be linked to virulence. In the current study, not only was the in vitro growth at later time points significantly higher in the spaceflight strains than in the ground control strains (Supplementary Fig. 1), and there is a significant difference with in vivo growth after infection with spaceflight and ground control strains (Fig. 1b), as well as increased in vivo growth in LSMMG bacteria compared to the RWV-control (Fig. 3b). This suggests that bacteria growth rates are perhaps linked to the increased lethality between spaceflight strains and ground strains, especially since we did not find significant changes in host immune-related genes after infection with spaceflight sample compared to ground sample in wild-type ground-reared flies (Fig. 4a–f and Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, in vitro growth was significantly higher for spaceflight samples compared to ground samples, specifically starting around hour 12, which is consistent with the in vivo increase in growth after injections (Supplementary Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that the media composition and nutrient availability can have significant effects on growth kinetics and virulence of pathogens.16 Current studies in our laboratory are testing whether microgravity treatment confers a specific growth advantage over ground bacteria at later times in growth when specific nutrients may become limiting in the media, as well as whether or not growth kinetics can be affected by the inclusion or exclusion of specific growth factors from the media. Specifically, it may be possible that the spaceflight and LSMMG environment may confer some advantage to the bacteria when nutrients become limited, such that the low fluid shear environment allows growth to either increase or not become hindered by the decrease in nutrient in the media over time. This also emphasizes the need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of pathogens that are changing in LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, which has become a field of great interest recently. It has been shown that after spaceflight, there are global changes in expression of genes that may potentially be related to virulence15,17 and that some pathogens are more likely to form biofilms after exposure to spaceflight.18 Because the pathogens in the current study are also Gram-negative and are similarly opportunistic to the pathogens evaluated in previous studies, it may be expected that there are quantifiable genetic mechanisms that may be responsible for the decreased survival we found after infection. Therefore, current studies are focused on eliciting the potential underlying genetic mechanisms that are driving increased virulence.",

Copyright notice ID: 7000411 PMID: 32047838 Abstract While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized. Subject terms: Infection, Innate immunity, MicrobiologyIntroduction As space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is considerable interest in understanding the changes in human physiology under spaceflight conditions. Spaceflight includes not only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation, isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous studies have demonstrated that these stressors have a significant impact on the ability of the immune system to respond appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production,1–5 changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution4,6,7 and general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and adaptive immune systems.8,9 This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important when considering that there have been studies demonstrating significant effects of microgravity and spaceflight conditions on the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats.10–17 Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have been shown to have increased growth in spaceflight,18,19 increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence.20,21 Investigations of the effects of spaceflight in humans have been especially varied, likely due to both low sample sizes and variability in experimental methodology.22 The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a promising model for understanding the effects of spaceflight on human immunity and pathogenesis, as they have been shown previously to experience a dramatic shift in immune gene expression following spaceflight.23,24 Using invertebrate models for investigating the human immune system has proven both fruitful and convenient, as they are cost-effective, have short generation times, and importantly, have immune systems with high homology to humans.25,26 While invertebrates lack a characterized adaptive immune system, the inducible innate immune response of Drosophila melanogaster is highly similar to humans,25,27,28 with about 75% of human disease-causing genes with a functional homolog in the fruit fly.25,29 The human opportunistic bacteria Serratia marcescens has only recently emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports.30,31 Furthermore, S. marcescens has been found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station (ISS),32,33 suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens. D. melanogaster has been recently used as a model for studying S. marcescens, as there are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught flies that are pathogenic.34–38 Importantly, the specific strains used in this study are not pathogenic to humans,34 making this system an ideal model for safely studying spaceflight-induced changes to S. marcescens using a model system. Studies in true spaceflight conditions are difficult to perform due to cost, limited availability of launches and crew time, and the complexity of experimental design under the tight volumetric and mass constraints of space habitats. Consequently, many studies on the effects of spaceflight on bacteria are also followed up with ground-based simulated microgravity experiments,16,17,39 which allows for further investigation into microgravity-related effects. In this study, the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens was sent to the ISS, where it was exposed to true spaceflight conditions, while ground-based strains were used in tandem both as controls and as replicates grown in simulated microgravity conditions (rotating wall vessel (RWV) apparatus) in order to investigate whether changes in bacterial physiology could be replicated accurately in future ground-based studies. In our study, space-flown or simulated microgravity-treated bacteria were used to infect D. melanogaster to investigate changes in space-induced lethality, both in wild-type flies, as well as in immune pathway mutants. Results showed that both space-flown and ground-based microgravity simulations (e.g., low-shear modeled microgravity or LSMMG treatment) resulted in increased virulence of Serratia marcescens on D. melanogaster hosts. Interestingly, the increased virulence phenotype is lost after passaging of the space-flown and LSMMG-treated bacteria under ground conditions. Taken together, this suggests that spaceflight induces a physiological change in the pathogen resulting in the decreased survivability of the D. melanogaster host and that this effect can be reversed after the bacterial cells resume normal growth on the ground.Results Survival of D. melanogaster after infection with spaceflight samples Fly survival was significantly lower when infected with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens samples compared to the ground control bacterial samples (Fig. 1). For the first spaceflight sample (Space 1), survival was significantly different from both Ground 1 (P < 0.0001) and Ground 2 (P < 0.0001) samples. The same was true for the second spaceflight isolate (Space 2) when compared with ground control samples. Full statistical results are reported in Table 1. Space 1 and Space 2 were separate samples of bacteria collected from two different plates after spaceflight, and both showed increased virulence compared to ground control bacteria. However they also showed differences between each other in terms of the magnitude of their changes with Space 1 causing greater virulence changes compared to Space 2 samples. This is discussed later in the context of temporary/reversible physiological changes induced by spaceflight vs genetic/heritable changes in the bacteria (see below for “Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample”).

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2In vivo growth of spaceflight S. marcescens in fly host after injection In vivo growth of injected bacteria was not significantly different between space and ground samples at hours 0 (F = 0.9113, P = 0.489), 6 (F = 0.5316, P = 0.6772) or 9 (F = 1.169, P = 0.3964) post-injection. At hour 12 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 sample was significantly higher in the fly host than the Ground sample (P = 0.0002) and Space 2 (P = 0.0011). At hour 15 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 remained significantly higher than Ground (P = 0.0002) and Space 2 (P = 0.04), and Space 2 in vivo growth was significantly higher than Ground (P = 0.006) (Fig. 1b). Therefore, the kinetics of bacterial growth within the host are different for the bacterial cultures returning from space compared to the ground control samples, particularly 12 h and onwards post-infection. In vitro growth of the space-flown bacteria, outside the host, show a similar increase in growth kinetics at later time points compared to the ground control bacteria (Supplementary Fig. 1).Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample Given that two separate isolates of bacteria had shown increased virulence after spaceflight exposure (Fig. 1), we wanted to assess whether these changes were reversible physiological changes in the bacteria induced by the stress of spaceflight or whether they were genetically heritable changes induced, for instance, by ionizing radiation exposure during spaceflight. After subculturing spaceflight and ground samples of S. marcescens in normal Earth gravity overnight, Space 1-injected host survival was not significantly different from either Ground 1 (P = 0.995) or Ground 2 (P = 0.337) host injected samples. Similarly, Space 2 subculture-infected hosts did not show significant differences in survival from Ground 1 (P = 0.5223) or Ground 2 (P = 0.113) infected hosts (Fig. 2a). Full statistical output is reported in Table 2. These results suggest that the increased virulence detected after spaceflight were temporary changes acquired by the bacteria during spaceflight and that after subculturing under normal conditions on Earth, these differences were no longer detectable after infection of fruit fly hosts.

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2In vivo growth after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample There was no significant difference of in vivo growth of the spaceflight vs ground bacteria within the host (Fig. 2b) at hours 0 (F = 13.41, P = 0.146), 9 (F = 0.238, P = 0.866), 12 (F = 0.443, P = 0.731) or 15 (F = 0.479, P = 0.708) hours post-infection. This data was consistent with the fact that there were no differences detected in virulence of the first ground subcultures in the host (Fig. 2a).Host survival after injection with LSMMG-treated bacteria Since spaceflight opportunities are relatively infrequent, a model that has often been used on the ground to simulate microgravity conditions for aqueous cultures is the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) or the RWV.15,17,39 We used the RWV apparatus to assess whether we could recreate some or all of the virulence changes that we had measured from the spaceflight samples by simulating the low fluid shear of the microgravity environment on Earth. This is done by rotating the vessel in a perpendicular orientation, where the rotation of the apparatus offsets the sedimental effects of the gravity force and provides continual suspension of the cells. In the control, the axis of rotation is parallel with the gravity force vector and as such, this force is not offset and the cells are allowed to settle.11,13 Host survival was significantly lower for hosts infected with S. marcescens that was grown in LSMMG compared to both the PBS Sham (ratio = 4.42, P < 0.0001) and the RWV Control (Ratio = 3.37, P = 0.0002) (Fig. 3a). The RWV Control consists of the same container as is used to simulate microgravity but is rotated about an axis that is oriented at 90 degrees to the LSMMG rotation and is therefore exposed to 1 g Earth’s gravity.11 Figure 3a therefore shows that we are able to recreate increased virulence in S. marcescens bacteria by simulating microgravity on Earth. This would suggest that the microgravity aspect of the spaceflight environment is at least one important factor to consider in terms of increased virulence in S. marcescens. Fig. 3. Simulated microgravity (SMG) can increase virulence of S. marcescens.

Error bars represent one standard error.In vivo growth of LSMMG S. marcescens There was no significant difference of in vivo growth between the LSMMG and RWV-Control bacteria at hour 0 (F = 3.551, P = 0.128) or at hour 6 post-infection (F = 7.493, P = 0.0544). However, there was a significant difference in CFU counts per fly between the LSMMG and RWV-Control at hours 9 (F = 20.428, P = 0.008), 12 (F = 12.455, P = 0.019), and 15 (F = 18.427, P = 0.009) post-infection (Fig. 3b). These altered growth kinetics also mirror some of the differences observed previously with the spaceflight samples (Fig. 1b), where the bacterial samples that show increased virulence, also show increased rates of growth within the host particularly at later time points.Infection of Immune Deficiency (Imd) and Toll pathway mutants of D. melanogaster Since the increase in virulence of spaceflight bacteria was accompanied by an increase in the rate of growth of the bacteria within the fly host, we wanted to determine whether this was a result of a change that the bacteria were able to induce in the host by weakening the hosts’ immune system for example, or whether the bacterial physiology was altered to better withstand the host’s immune defenses. In order to test this hypothesis, we used flies that were mutant in two of the major immune defense pathways in flies, the Imd and the Toll pathways.40,41 As expected, all Imd mutant flies (PGRP-LCΔ5, imd1, and relishE20) succumb to any Sm infections (including ground control Sm) much more quickly than either of the wild-type fly lines (y1w* or w1118) as seen in Fig. 4a, since the Imd pathway is known to be critical for defense against infection with Gram-negative bacteria,42 such as Serratia marcescens. On the other hand, the Toll pathway is primarily known to be important for defense against Gram-positive bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore as expected, there is much less change in the viability of Toll deficient mutants (PGRP-SAseml and dif1) after ground control Sm infections compared to wild-type flies (Fig. 4c). Compared to ground control Sm however, the spaceflight bacteria Space 1 causes greater lethality in all of the fly lines (compare Fig. 4b vs a, and 4d vs c). Therefore the data suggests that regardless of the genotype of the fly host, whether impaired for immune function or robust wild-type lines, the space-flown bacteria causes greater lethality than ground control Sm. The statistical output is shown in Supplementary Tables 2–6. Fig. 4. Measuring host changes in wild-type and mutant ground flies exposed to space-flown S. marcescens. Open in a new tab Survival curves of Imd pathway mutant flies, a and b, and of Toll pathway mutant flies, c and d, after exposure to either Ground 1 bacteria, a and c, or Space 1 bacteria, b and d. All graphs have data from two wild-type flies (y1w* and w1118) for reference. e Volcano plot of the RNA-seq data from ground-reared wild-type D. melanogaster that were infected with space bacteria relative to ground bacteria. RNA was extracted from infected flies 18 h post-infection. The x-axis represents the beta-value, an estimator of fold change, and the y-axis represents the −log10q value, a p-value adjusted for false discovery rate. Red dots represent transcripts with q-value < 0.05, which are considered significantly differentially expressed. f PCA of ground, space, and sham injected flies shows no major difference in distribution of the groups between the conditions, with as much variation occurring within conditions as between conditions.RNA sequencing data analysis of infected ground-reared host To further test whether infection with microgravity-treated bacteria induced changes in gene expression in the ground-reared host, RNA sequencing was performed for wild-type fruit flies after infection with either spaceflight or ground control sample of S. marcescens. These results showed that there were few significant changes in host gene expression of known immune-related genes when exposed to the two bacterial sample types (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Table 1). At the significance threshold (q-values < 0.05), only eleven transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. However principal components analysis (PCA) comparing transcript abundance across the treatments showed that there is significant overlap among the groups, further indicating that there are few differences between the space bacteria-infected and ground bacteria-infected fruit fly hosts (Fig. 4f). It is worth noting that, since the flies collected for RNA-Seq were still alive at 18 h post-injection, this may have biased the selection of flies in which infection had not greatly progressed, as they were still alive at this late time point. Similarity in gene expression across both conditions to a control sham condition shown by PCA supports this idea. Comparing the space bacteria-infected ground flies to the ground bacteria-infected flies, there were a total of 11 differentially expressed genes (see Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 1 for gene details). Out of these 11 differentially expressed genes, only AttA (Attacin-A) is known to be directly related to the immune response.43 The gene AttA is an antimicrobial peptide that is expressed in the fat body in response to Gram-negative pathogens.43 The most highly overexpressed gene is lola (longitudinals lacking), a gene that is involved in axon growth and guidance in the central and peripheral nervous systems.44 The next most highly overexpressed gene is vsg (visgun), a gene linked to alcohol sensitivity.45 Among the most underexpressed genes is eEF2, is a translation elongation factor,46 and CG31650 with unknown function. The underexpressed RhoGEF2 has been recently linked to wound repair, but is primarily involved in the regulation of actin and myosin dynamics through interacting effector proteins.47 While only one of these genes is directly related to the host immune pathway, follow-up studies will be conducted to elucidate the potential role of these additional differentially expressed genes in the host.Discussion In this study, we found that flies infected with a bacterial pathogen that had been grown during spaceflight was significantly more lethal than ground controls (Fig. 1). This trend persisted in strains that had been grown in LSMMG conditions, suggesting that microgravity may be the primary factor mediating the differences in virulence seen in the spaceflight bacteria strains (Fig. 3). Interestingly, this increased lethality disappears after the first subculture is conducted on the ground, which means that the differences in virulence are short-lived and do not persist after being cultured under normal gravity conditions (Fig. 2). This is consistent with previous studies, which found that spaceflight-induced changes to pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus reverted upon return to Earth conditions.10 We also sought to understand whether the host immune system may be responding differently to spaceflight-altered bacteria. While it has been shown in previous studies that space-flown pathogens decrease the survival of hosts compared to their ground-reared counterparts,15,16 less is known about how the host immune system may be influenced differently by space-flown pathogens. This is also the first study in spaceflight and in simulated microgravity to evaluate microgravity-induced changes of the pathogen S. marcescens in a live host, as previous studies in the field of host-pathogen interactions have focused primarily on Salmonella15 and other microbes.48–50 Utilizing common immune pathway mutants, we determined that regardless of whether the Imd or Toll pathways were altered, infection with spaceflight sample decreases survival of flies compared to infection with ground sample of S. marcescens (Fig. 4). Studies in spaceflight and modeled microgravity have shown that when the host is exposed to microgravity conditions, the immune responses can be altered by the presence of symbiotic bacteria.51 Other studies have shown that when different pathogens are exposed to LSMMG and then tested on naive hosts, responses can vary widely depending on the specific pathogen used.52 Similarly in our study with ground-reared fly host, while there appear to be few genes that are differentially expressed after injection with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens compared to the ground control bacteria, most of the highly differentially regulated genes do not appear to be directly immune-related, with the exception of Attacin (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 1). This antimicrobial peptide is known to respond to Gram-negative pathogens,43 so an increase in expression in response to S. marcescens is expected. However, the increase in expression in space-infected flies compared to ground-infected flies may be due to the increase in bacterial load in the space-infected individuals. Because there is a significant increase of in vivo growth seen in both spaceflight samples and LSMMG samples, it may be possible that some of these host genes may have an unknown interaction with the immune system that facilitates the faster proliferation of microgravity-experienced bacteria after infection. However given that the space-flown bacteria have faster growth kinetics in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1) as well as in vivo, the current results indicate that the differences in lethality and survival following infection of bacteria altered by spaceflight and LSMMG are likely due to changes to the pathogen, rather than a difference in host immune response of ground-reared flies. This study is the first to demonstrate that spaceflight influences the growth and virulence characteristics of bacteria grown on a solid substrate. While many previous studies have shown that cell density and growth characteristics are altered in liquid suspension during spaceflight (reviewed in Huang et al.,53) the few studies that have cultured microbes on solid media found no difference in final cell density.54 Therefore, it was concluded that because there is no change in gravity vector for bacteria that are attached to a surface compared to those in a liquid suspension where there would be a lack of convection, that one should not expect to see a change in phenotype associated with growth on solid media in spaceflight. This argument is based on the idea that the bacteria are being affected indirectly by microgravity, due to the change in the physical properties of the liquid media that they are in, and not the effect of a change in gravity vector on the microbes themselves.55 However, Serratia marcescens is a nosocomial pathogen that can colonize a wide variety of habitats, and undergo significant phenotypic shifts depending on the properties of the growth media,56–58 including shifts in the polarity of the flagella on solid media to produce swarming cells. Because it’s thought that LSMMG may influence cell polarity in some single-celled organisms, it’s at least theoretically possible that some of these species may still be affected by microgravity at the cellular level, even on a solid substrate.59 A previous study showed that growth of E.coli and B.subtilis on agar in spaceflight did not show increased growth rates, and they did not measure virulence phenotypes of the samples.54 Therefore, it is possible that changes in phenotype in space can be manifested differently in different bacteria depending on the inherent characteristics required to colonize their normal habitat. While Wang et al.60 showed that S. marcescens did not change in physical properties on a semi-solid media in spaceflight conditions, they did provide evidence that significant transcriptomic and proteomic changes related to metabolism occurred in spaceflight sample compared to ground. We believe that these molecular and biological changes observed in S. marcescens on a semi-solid media in spaceflight provide a basis for the phenotypic changes observed in our study with bacteria grown on solid semi-defined media. While there was insufficient bacterial sample to conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in the current study, a subsequent spaceflight experiment in our lab has been conducted with S. marcescens to further characterize molecular changes on both solid and liquid media types in space and will be reported separately. This indicates that media type should not be limited to liquid suspension, and that further studies using both solid and liquid media types is warranted. A study performed with a different strain of S. marcescens (ATCC 14041) in LSMMG in liquid media showed that while there was no significant change in growth parameters, there was an increase in acid stress resistance, providing further evidence for phenotypic changes of this species to microgravity and LSMMG.61 Ongoing work in our lab, including more in-depth characterization of S. marcescens under LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, are currently being conducted to further elucidate the potential molecular and physiological mechanisms affecting growth kinetics and changes in virulence seen in altered gravity. A previous study found that growth rate was not a major factor affecting the physiology and virulence of one strain S. marcescens,62 but there is speculation that growth rate and virulence may be linked due to common factors that influence both characteristics.63,64 Recent studies in humans demonstrated that slower growth rates of Bacillus pathogens actually predicted higher virulence,65 suggesting that there is conflicting data that likely varies by species and environmental factors and that growth rates may be linked to virulence. In the current study, not only was the in vitro growth at later time points significantly higher in the spaceflight strains than in the ground control strains (Supplementary Fig. 1), and there is a significant difference with in vivo growth after infection with spaceflight and ground control strains (Fig. 1b), as well as increased in vivo growth in LSMMG bacteria compared to the RWV-control (Fig. 3b). This suggests that bacteria growth rates are perhaps linked to the increased lethality between spaceflight strains and ground strains, especially since we did not find significant changes in host immune-related genes after infection with spaceflight sample compared to ground sample in wild-type ground-reared flies (Fig. 4a–f and Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, in vitro growth was significantly higher for spaceflight samples compared to ground samples, specifically starting around hour 12, which is consistent with the in vivo increase in growth after injections (Supplementary Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that the media composition and nutrient availability can have significant effects on growth kinetics and virulence of pathogens.16 Current studies in our laboratory are testing whether microgravity treatment confers a specific growth advantage over ground bacteria at later times in growth when specific nutrients may become limiting in the media, as well as whether or not growth kinetics can be affected by the inclusion or exclusion of specific growth factors from the media. Specifically, it may be possible that the spaceflight and LSMMG environment may confer some advantage to the bacteria when nutrients become limited, such that the low fluid shear environment allows growth to either increase or not become hindered by the decrease in nutrient in the media over time. This also emphasizes the need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of pathogens that are changing in LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, which has become a field of great interest recently. It has been shown that after spaceflight, there are global changes in expression of genes that may potentially be related to virulence15,17 and that some pathogens are more likely to form biofilms after exposure to spaceflight.18 Because the pathogens in the current study are also Gram-negative and are similarly opportunistic to the pathogens evaluated in previous studies, it may be expected that there are quantifiable genetic mechanisms that may be responsible for the decreased survival we found after infection. Therefore, current studies are focused on eliciting the potential underlying genetic mechanisms that are driving increased virulence.Materials and methods D. melanogaster fly strains Fly lines were maintained in a 12-h light-dark cycle on cornmeal-agar media (torula yeast, dextrose, cornmeal, agar, Tegosept, propionic acid, ethanol) at ambient temperature (~24 °C). All fly lines were obtained from Bloomington Stock center including w1118 (#3605), OregonR SP2 (no. 2376), relE20 (no. 55714), y1w* (no. 55707), dif1 (no. 36559), imd1 (no. 55711), PGRP-LCΔ5 (#36323), and PGRP-SAseml (#55716).Bacterial growth conditions during spaceflight The hardware used in this study was the FIT (Fly Immunity and Tumors) cassette and changeout platform, as described in our previous Drosophila experiments on the ISS.23,66 Food trays were prepared using the methods described below, and stored in a cargo transfer bag (CTB) at 4 °C for launch. Towards the end of the 30 day spaceflight (Fruit Fly Lab – 01 on SpaceX-CRS 5 mission), the food trays containing S. marcescens were retrieved from 4 °C storage and placed within the FIT food changeout platform. The platform was placed in a canvas CTB at ISS ambient temperature (23–25 °C) for 5 days, plus 2 days in the SpaceX Dragon (22–25 °C) for undocking/descent and retrieval. During the growth period, environmental data (CO2, O2, temperature, and relative humidity) was recorded and used to match the growth conditions for ground control experiments.Preparation of S. marcescens Db11 for spaceflight Serratia marcescens Db11 was obtained from the University of Minnesota C. elegans stock center. To prepare for the spaceflight experiment, the Db11 strain was grown for 20 h in liquid LB broth with 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C and then diluted to an OD600 of 0.100 in PBS. Next, 100 µL of the diluent was spread onto the surface of two trays containing 2 mL of solid semi-defined fly food media containing 4% Brewer’s yeast (Redstar), 6% glucose, 3% sucrose, 2% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1% agar, 0.05% magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 0.05% calcium chloride dihydrate (Sigma), 0.5% of blue food dye (Smart and Final), 0.001% p-hydroxybenzoate, and 0.6% of propionic acid (Sigma) dissolved in water. These two trays were the source of the Space 1 and Space 2 samples that were used in the experiments below. Similarly, we prepared two additional trays (Ground 1 and Ground 2) from the same source sample. These two trays were grown in the same FIT hardware on the ground, inside an incubator (Percival model DR36VL), which was programmed to match the gas composition, temperature, and humidity profiles measured during the flight. After preparing the bacterial sample trays for flight, they were placed into plastic bags and stored at 4 °C, then sent to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-5. Control trays were stored on the ground at 4 °C. Growth conditions on the ISS were described in the previous section. Upon retrieval after the spaceflight mission, bacteria were isolated from the surfaces using sterile cell scrapers and then placed into 50% glycerol and stored frozen at −80 °C. Similar isolation was performed in parallel for the ground samples. The placement of the bacterial cultures on semi-defined fly food media allowed for inflight infection of flies, as flies would ingest the bacteria that was growing on the media. However, due to logistical constraints during flight, in-flight infection was not possible and the bacterial cultures were grown in space and harvested after return for treatment of flies on the ground after flight as described in the following sections.Injection of spaceflight S. marcescens Db11 samples into D. melanogaster Injections of bacteria were performed according to methods described previously by our group and others.23,67 Concentrations of spaceflight and ground samples stored in 50% glycerol at −80 °C were determined by performing colony counts on LB plates. These samples were then diluted in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) down to ~4 × 103 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections. Sterile 12.5% glycerol in sterile PBS was used as a sham injection control. For survival experiments and in vivo growth assays for both spaceflight bacteria and ground-based simulated microgravity-treated bacteria, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting (Figs 1–4). Concentrations were adjusted so that each injection was ~10 CFU/fly. Control, ground, or spaceflight samples were then injected into anesthetized 2–3 day-old female (post-eclosion) D. melanogaster in the ventrolateral abdomen. Injections of immune mutant flies were done using a Picospritzer III (Parker Hannifin, New Hampshire). Injection bolus was calibrated to 600 nm diameter, which equaled approximately 10 CFU/fly. Injections of each treatment group took <1 h, with the survival measurements beginning at the end of that first hour. After injections, flies were kept at 25 °C on the same standard dextrose food that they were reared on, and survival was monitored every hour for at least 24 h. Survival curves were measured by performing three independent experiments using a minimum of N = 50 flies in each experiment, then pooling the data from all three experiments for the Cox Proportional Hazard survival analysis, which measures the magnitude of difference in survival between different treatment groups. In vivo bacterial load was assayed in the fly at 0, 9, 12, and 15 h post-injection. Bacterial load was assayed immediately following injection by placing three flies in 200 µL of PBS and homogenized for ~1 min using a handheld homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes, New Jersey). This homogenization procedure was repeated for each condition tested. Next, 100 µL of this sample was then spread/plated onto an LB agar plate. To assay subsequent time-points, three flies were placed in 200 µL of PBS and homogenized as above. This sample was then serially diluted, 20 µL into 180 µL of PBS until a dilution of 105 was obtained. Next, 40 µL from each dilution from 100 to 105 was then spot plated onto an LB agar plate and allowed to dry. All plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight before counting. Each in vivo bacterial load experiment was independently repeated three times and each experiment included three replicate samples per time point for all experiments. Error bars were calculated to represent one standard error. Due to limited bacterial sample availability from the spaceflight mission and the time required to inject 50 or more individual flies per condition per experiment, not all samples (Space 1 and 2, Ground 1 and 2) were included in every experiment. After initial experiments had verified the consistency of the virulence data from Space 1 and Space 2 samples relative to the Ground 1 and Ground 2 samples, only one sample from each spaceflight and ground condition was chosen in subsequent studies.Ground subcultures of spaceflight sample Injections to test the virulence of space-flown bacteria were performed as noted above where the spaceflight and ground bacteria were diluted in PBS from frozen glycerol stocks and directly injected into the fly host. However to test whether the space-flown bacteria would retain their increased virulence after growing under ground conditions for several generations, bacterial cultures were first allowed to grow for 24 h (~23 generations of growth) on the ground before injecting into Drosophila hosts. A sterile inoculation loop was used to transfer a small amount of glycerol stocks into liquid LB + 100 µg/mL streptomycin, then grown for 24 h in a 37 °C incubator with a shaker set to 225 rpm. These samples were then diluted in PBS down to ~4 × 103 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections, and injections were performed as described above.Growth of S. marcescens Db11 in the RWV Cultures of Db11 were grown from non-spaceflight lab stocks of Db11 frozen at −80 °C in Copan Cryovials, onto agar plates with streptomycin (LB + 100 µg/mL) for 18–24 h and then stored at 4 °C for at most 2 weeks. Liquid subcultures were created using a single colony from these agar plates and grown in conical tubes at 37 °C in liquid LB media containing 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 25 rpm for 24 h. These liquid subcultures were then diluted down to A600 of 0.100 in LB media before being further diluted 1:1000 in LB + 100 µg/mL streptomycin and placed into a sterile disposable 10 mL RWV (Synthecon). Air bubbles were removed from the RWV and sealed. Pairs of RWV were then placed in either horizontal (simulated microgravity or LSMMG) or vertical (normal gravity, NG) axis at 37 °C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al.11) Samples were grown for 24 h to ensure that stationary phase was reached.Injection of RWV samples into D. melanogaster Injections were performed as noted above with the following alterations. Stationary phase cultures from RWV were diluted down to an A600 of 0.100 in PBS and then further diluted down 1/100 fold to an end concentration of ~8 × 103 CFU/mL in PBS. Approximately 65 nL of sterile PBS, LSMMG, or NG cultures were then injected into 2–3-day old flies as noted above. Survival and bacterial load were both monitored as previously stated.RNA extraction and sequencing from infected fly host In order to see whether there was any difference in host immunity after infection with Space or Ground bacteria, RNA was extracted in triplicate from two live ground-reared adult flies for each treatment (space or ground sample injection) approximately 18 h after infection using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (catalog no. 74104) with β-mercaptoethanol (10 µL/mL) in the lysis buffer. Lysis was performed by placing the flies in a 1.5 mL tube containing 600 µL of the lysis buffer, which were then homogenized for ~1 min using a handheld homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes, New Jersey). The entire homogenate was then placed in the manufacturer-supplied spin column, where an on-column DNase digestion step was performed as per manufacturer recommendation). An additional purification step was added using additional wash steps with the kit buffers. Samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform with 100 bp reads and paired-end library prep. Transcript abundance estimates from the raw sequenced reads were made using kallisto (version 0.42.4)68 and the D. melanogaster reference transcriptome (build r6.13). Differential expression analysis between Space and Ground bacteria infection conditions was performed using sleuth (version 0.30.0) Wald test.69 Transcripts with q-values < 0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and JMP Pro 13 (SAS). Graphs were made in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and in Excel (version 15.4). For survival analyses, a Cox Proportional Hazards model was used, with the exception of the Toll and Imd mutant injections, for which a Log-rank Mantel-Cox analysis was performed to compare curves across treatments. The Cox Proportional Hazards model allows for the comparison of survival between all groups when there are multiple risk factors or treatments involved. For in vivo growth measurements, a one-way ANOVA was used in combination with a Tukey-Kramer post hoc analysis. For all statistical analyses with the exception of the first subculture growth and survival, only results with a statistical significance < 0.05 are reported, due to the magnitude of results tables.Ethics statement We use the invertebrate model system Drosophila melanogaster for this study, in accordance, the study was exempt from ethics committee approval.Supplementary information Supplementary material (91.6KB, pdf) nr-reporting-summary (1.3MB, pdf) Acknowledgements We would like to thank Matthew Lera (M.L.), Amy Gresser (A.G.) and Kevin Martin (K.M.) for spaceflight project support; and NASA’s Space Life and Physical Sciences Research Program (SLPSRA) for the following grants to S.B.: NNX13AN38G and NNX15AB42G.Author contributions R.G. is the primary author of this paper, and performed many of the reported experiments reported in this paper along with M.T. and analyzed all of the data reported.

    "title": "A parasitoid wasp of Drosophila employs preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete its host's blood cells",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191917/",
    "abstract": "Abstract The wasps Leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their Drosophila hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for L. heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts’ hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila. The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naïve animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that L. heterotoma infection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of L. heterotoma infection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside, L. heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite’s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for L. heterotoma are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Parasitoid (parasitic) wasps have an obligatory relationship with their insect hosts. Engaged in a biological “arms race,” each partner continuously adapts to the other to emerge alive. For reproductive success, parasitic wasps target their hosts’ behavior, development and immune system. Their attack mechanisms range from biochemical warfare and mimicry, to passive evasion and active immune suppression [1–3]. Drosophila and their parasitic wasps are an emerging model for studying how wasps evade or suppress host defenses [4,5]. The generalist Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh) succeeds on the Drosophila species within and beyond the melanogaster group. Its close relative, L. boulardi (Lb), considered a specialist, mainly infects flies of the melanogaster group. Both wasps are highly successful on D. melanogaster; they consume its developing larval and pupal stages to emerge as free-living adults [6]. Oviposition into second-to-early-third D. melanogaster larval hosts by Lb and Lh wasps yields divergent immunological effects. Lb infection activates many components of humoral and cellular immunity: Toll-NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the melanization pathways and their target genes are transcriptionally upregulated; there is a burst of hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation of blood cells (also called hemocytes) in the lymph gland and in circulation. If the immune responses are strong and sustained, macrophages and lamellocytes encapsulate and kill wasp eggs [7–11]. Lh infection in contrast suppresses immune gene expression and kills immature and mature larval hemocytes [12,13]. Lb and Lh females (and also L. victoriae, a sister species of Lh) produce discrete immune-suppressive extracellular vesicle- (EV) like structures in their venom glands (called multi-strategy extracellular vesicles, MSEVs in Lh and venosomes in Lb) [14,15]. Previously called virus like particles [16–18], these EVs lack clear viral features [15,19]. They are produced in the venom gland, a structure made up of the long gland and a reservoir. The secretory cells of the long gland synthesize and secrete proteins, some of which are initially incorporated into discrete non-spiked vesicle-like structures. In sister species Lh and Lv, these structures mature in the reservoir and assume a stellate morphology with 4–8 spikes radiating from the center. Mature EVs are roughly 300 nm in diameter, [14,16,20–22]. Packed with more than 150 proteins, EVs are, in part, responsible for divergent physiological outcomes in infected hosts [15,19,23]. Among the most abundant in the Lh EV proteins is a 40 kDa surface/spike protein (SSp40) [20]. SSp40 shares structural similarities with the IpaD/SipD family of proteins of the gastroenteric disease-causing Gram negative bacteria, Shigella and Salmonella [15]. Similar to SSp40’s localization to Lh EV spike tips, IpaD localizes to the tips of the T3 secretion injectisome, a bacterial transfer system that injects virulence proteins into mammalian cells. IpaD itself promotes apoptosis of mammalian macrophages [24,25]. These parallels between Lh SSp40 and bacterial IpaD/SipD suggest that Lh EVs may share some similarities with bacterial secretion systems. Comparative transcriptomic/proteomic approaches revealed that SSp40 and a few other EV proteins are not expressed in the Lb venom [15]. Whereas Lh EVs lyse lamellocytes within a few hours of wasp attack, Lb EVs do not have the same effect [7,16,26]. Our immune-inhibition experiments suggested that Lh’s SSp40 mediates EV interactions with lamellocytes [20]. Lh infection also uniquely promotes apoptosis of larval macrophages and of lymph gland hemocytes [13]. Macrophages make up more than 95% of all hematopoietic cells while differentiated lamellocytes are rarely found in naïve hosts [8–10,27]. Work in the field strongly suggests that the protein activities concentrated within the Lh EVs are responsible for the destruction of these mature and immature blood cells. However, how a macro-endoparasite targets the hematopoietic system and accesses its progenitor population has not been studied. The modes of Lh EV entry into these cells and the pathways of destruction are also not well understood. The goal of this study was to obtain a macro-level view of Lh EV interactions with cells of the larval hemolymphatic system after infection. The term hemolymph refers to the interstitial fluid that distributes hormones, peptides and other macromolecules into organs through the pumping action of an unbranched tubular heart, or the dorsal vessel. Dozens of macrophages circulate in the hemolymph. The heart lumen is surrounded by a column of paired cardiomyocytes and associated pericardial cells. This tubular structure is held in place by alary muscles [28–30]. Hematopoietic cells are organized in paired cell clusters (or lobes) on the dorsal vessel. In third instar larvae, the anterior-most lobes have blood cells at various stages of differentiation; the least differentiated progenitors are confined adjacent to the dorsal vessel, whereas the developing macrophages are sequestered in the cortical regions of the lobes (Fig 1A). In naïve hosts, the progenitor state is maintained by a putative niche (also called the posterior signaling center, PSC). The PSC is a tight unit of about 25–50 cells and is positioned posteriorly to the progenitors [31,32]. Upon Lb infection, the PSC reprograms hematopoiesis inducing macrophage and lamellocyte differentiation [30,32–39]. The entire structure is covered by the acellular basement membrane [28,40]. Fig 1. Lh EVs associate with the larval lymphatic system.

(I-K) Posterior lobes from uninfected (I) and Lh-infected animals (J, K). (L) Circulating hemocytes from infected animals. Using Drosophila genetics, cell-specific markers and SSp40 staining as a proxy for Lh EV localization, we have pieced together a broad view of this host-parasite interaction interface. We show an abundance of Lh EVs in (a) the lumen of the larval dorsal vessel, (b) along the collagen/perlecan-based basement membrane around the dorsal vessel and surrounding clusters of lymph gland progenitors, and (c) inside the progenitor and mature macrophages. Moreover, high EV signal correlates with the disassembly of the cohesive PSC unit. PSC ablation limits EV internalization and loss of lymph gland hemocytes, while PSC inactivation via hedgehog (hh) knockdown (KD) does not have this effect. We also show that lymph gland hemocytes can phagocytose Lh EVs using the classical Rab5-mediated retrograde transport (RGT) pathway. Surprisingly, Rab5 also maintains fly macrophage identity, as Rab5 KD leads to over-proliferation, lamellocyte differentiation and tumorigenesis; Rab5 function is cell-autonomous. Thus lymph glands are not merely a source of mature blood cells but are themselves immune competent organs and can clear the immune-suppressive Lh EVs to defend the host. However, Lh EVs proactively dislodge cells of the PSC, blocking differentiation of the protective immune cells. Lh EVs target the endomembrane system of macrophages that ultimately results in their apoptosis, thus highlighting central and previously unrecognized roles of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. These observations help explain why Lh infections target the larval lymph gland. The direct EV-macrophage interactions and cellular outcomes set the stage for future molecular analyses in both the hosts and parasites.",

    "results": "Results Lh EVs are present within the larval lymphatic system Lb17 attack triggers lamellocyte differentiation in the larval lymph gland cortex (Fig 1A–1C). At an equivalent time-point, Lh-infected lobes are significantly smaller (Fig 1D–1K); [13]. Surprisingly, unlike Antp>mCD8GFP-expressing PSCs of naïve and Lb-infected lobes that remain tightly clustered (Fig 1A–1C), PSC cells of Lh-infected hosts are dislodged and some are distributed in the body of the lobe (Fig 1D). To understand these responses, we imaged more than 25 hosts in multiple experiments. Throughout these studies, we used a polyclonal antibody to mark SSp40, an Lh EV-specific protein [20]. Lh infection of Pxn>GFP animals reduced Pxn>GFP expression (Fig 1E–1H). (Pxn is normally active in the cortex and its expression mimics that of many other genes downregulated by Lh infection [7]). An abundance of Lh EVs was observed in anterior- and posterior-lobe hemocytes, in the dorsal vessel, and in circulating hemocytes (Fig 1F–1H and 1J–1L). This staining signal is absent in glands from naïve animals (Fig 1E and 1I). Thus, Lb and Lh attack have drastically different outcomes and Lh EVs appear to interact directly with most lymph gland hemocytes. In our analyses across experiments, we found that the degree of tissue loss and EV distribution varies. Lobe morphologies ranged from nearly intact and filled with EVs (Fig 1F and 1J) to damaged lobes, with few to many EVs (Fig 1G, 1H and 1K). This variation is likely due to (a) the duration of infection (i.e., time between oviposition and dissection); (b) the injected EV dose; or (c) the dynamics of EV circulation. Dissections at later time points showed loss of almost all lymph gland hemocytes [13]. To then probe how Lh EVs enter the lymphatic system, we stained Lh-infected glands from fly strains with GFP-tagged Collagen IV (basement membrane, Viking [41]) or GFP-tagged proteoglycan core protein, Perlecan/Trol [42]. In both cases, EV puncta were clearly localized with the continuous GFP signals of these extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins along the dorsal vessel as well as in the interstitial spaces around clustered hematopoietic progenitors (yellow puncta in Fig 2A–2D’ arrows). Surprisingly, punctate staining was also seen inside immature progenitors, adjacent to the dorsal vessel (Fig 2B, 2B’ 2D and 2D’). EVs were also observed inside some cardiomyocytes as evidenced by SSp40 colocalization with the mCD8GFP signal in HandΔ>mCD8GFP larvae (Fig 2E–2F’, arrows). Thus, Lh EVs associate with ECM proteins of the lymphatic system, enter the dorsal vessel lumen and even some cardiomyocytes. Fig 2. Lh EVs associate with basement membrane proteins.

Effects of Lh infection on PSC integrity Previous studies have demonstrated that upon Lb infection, the PSC reprograms hematopoietic development and promotes lamellocyte differentiation. Similar to controls, Lb infected PSCs remain tightly clustered [35,37,38,43,44]. We found that regardless of the Lh strain, PSC cells dislodged from their normal posterior position into the body of the lobe (Figs 1D and S1A and S1B). At the time points we examined, half of the PSC cells relocated into the lobe, of which an overwhelming majority (> 95%) were present as single cells or as groups of two cells. The other half remained in their original place, although some were not as tightly clustered (Figs 1D and S1; n = 24 PSCs from 12 lymph glands). As expected, in 14 lobes from naïve controls, all PSC cells were tightly packed. Strikingly, in samples from infected animals, where the PSCs were still intact, EVs congregated in regions adjacent to the PSC, but were never found inside the PSC cells (S1A and S1B Fig). The Slit ligand, originating from adjacent cardiomyocytes, controls PSC integrity via the Robo receptors in the PSC; Robo2 has the strongest effect [45]. Indeed, the effect of Lh infection on the PSC resembles Slit/Robo2 KD, which promotes PSC disassembly [45] (Figs 1 and S1). A cohesive PSC is important in hematopoietic development as fewer macrophages and crystal cells develop in Slit/Robo2 KD lobes compared to controls. But differing from Lh infection, Slit KD PSCs are larger and there is no apparent loss of progenitors [45]. In spite of different outcomes in the two conditions, we hypothesized that the initial steps might be shared and that Lh EVs might inactivate the Slit-Robo signal, which might explain PSC disassembly. To test this idea, we infected animals in which the Slit-Robo pathway was manipulated to promote constitutive signaling. We found that neither expressing active Slit nor overexpressing Robo2 altered Lh EVs’ ability to disassemble the PSC. Lh infection of HandΔ>Slit-N animals still promoted PSC disassembly (S2A–S2C’ Fig; n = 16 lobes) even though gain-of-function Slit-N [46] reverses the effects of Slit KD [45]. Similarly, Lh infection bypassed the effects of Robo2 overexpression (Antp>Robo2-HA) and promoted PSC disassembly S2D–S2F’ Fig). Many EVs are observed around these PSCs (S3 Fig; n = 16). Thus, either EVs inactivate PSC function independently of the Slit-Robo signal, or they possess redundant mechanisms that disable constitutive Slit-Robo signaling. PSC-less lymph glands remain intact PSC-less lymph glands were unable to induce lamellocyte differentiation after Lb infection [36]. We asked if ablating the PSC might similarly inhibit the Lh infection responses. PSC-less lobes (Col>Hid) lacked Antp staining and Lh14 infection did not affect lobe integrity (S4A–S4D’ Fig; n > 12 lobes). Moreover, while Lh-infected UAS-Hid lobes lost progenitors and exhibited high levels of EV uptake (Fig 3A, 3B, 3D and 3E), Lh-infected PSC-less lobes remained intact and showed low, non-specific SSp40 staining signal in anterior and posterior lobes (Fig 3C and 3F; n > 12 lobes for each condition). In contrast to the non-responsive Col>Hid lobes, Antp>hhRNAi lobes responded to Lh infection and suffered progenitor cell loss (S5A–S5F Fig; n > 12 lobes for each condition). Thus, inactivating the signaling function of the PSC does not appear to affect the wasp’s ability to disassemble the PSC. P1 staining revealed that Lh infection does not block macrophage differentiation (S5C Fig). Taken together, these results suggest that the PSC plays a structural role in trafficking of EVs from either the hemolymph or the dorsal vessel into the lobes and that the cell-lethal effects of Lh EVs is distinct from the PSC’s niche function. Fig 3. PSC-less lymph glands from Lh-infected animals have intact lobes. Open in a new tab (A, D) Lobes from a naïve UAS-Hid host are intact and lack EVs; anterior (A), and posterior lobes (D). (B, E) Lymph gland from a Lh-infected UAS-Hid host is depleted of hemocytes and has many EVs. Anterior lobes (B, B’), and posterior lobes (E, E’). (C, F) PSC-less lobes from a Lh-infected Col>Hid host are intact with weak EV signal. Anterior (C, C’), and posterior lobes (F, F’). The larval lymph gland is phagocytically competent We next studied if EV uptake into hematopoietic cells occurs via RGT mechanisms. In Pxn>GFP; +/Bc heterozygous lymph glands, we observed blackened, dead crystal cells in the cytoplasm of the GFP-positive cortical cells (S6 Fig). This observation suggests that GFP-positive lymph gland cells are phagocytically competent. We therefore investigated if Lh EV uptake depends on Rab5, an early endosomal protein. Rab5 mediates trafficking from the plasma membrane to early endosomes [47]. In contrast to Pxn>GFP macrophages, where EV staining is bright and punctate throughout the cytoplasm (Fig 4A and 4B), Pxn>GFP, Rab5RNAi cells show peripheral punctate staining, presumably from intact EVs, trapped in early endosomes, both in lymph gland and circulating hemocytes (Fig 4C and 4D; arrows). In lamellocytes, the EV signal is diffuse and nuclear, and Rab5 KD shows no change in staining intensity or distribution (Fig 4E and 4F; arrowheads), suggesting that Rab5-independent uptake mechanisms are involved. msn-GFP- and integrin-β-positive lamellocyte fragments were also observed in Lh-infected macrophages suggesting occurrence of efferocytosis (S7 Fig).

Lamellocytes show a diffuse nuclear SSp40 signal (arrowhead). Lh EVs negatively impact phagolysosomal organization in macrophages Rab7 mediates late endosome formation and trafficking between late endosomes and lysosomes is marked by Rab7 and LAMP1, respectively [47]. To evaluate if Lh EVs impact the RGT machinery, infected glands expressing GFP-tagged Rab5, Rab7, or LAMP1 proteins were examined (Fig 5). Under our experimental conditions, Lh EVs rarely colocalized with early endosomes and Rab5 compartment morphology remained comparable to uninfected controls (only 14% of SSp40 puncta are Rab5-positive; n = 221 cells; 6 lobes; Fig 5A–5C). In contrast, Lh EVs were consistently found with GFP-Rab7 and GFP-LAMP1 and these compartments were grossly distorted (100% co-localization; n = 115 and 112 cells, Rab7 and LAMP, respectively, 6 lobes each; Fig 5D–5E”). Moreover, the Rab7/EV and LAMP1/EV signals were asymmetrically localized in Lh-affected cells. In contrast, Lb infection did not distort LAMP-positive compartments and they retained their normal morphology (Fig 5F and 5G). These observations suggest that high numbers of Lh EVs transit through early endosomes, but that they are retained in late RGT compartments including lysosomes. Thus, Lh EVs have a detrimental effect on RGT compartment integrity and this loss of integrity may promote lysosomal leakage and labilization. Fig 5.

Square brackets (D’,D”, E’,E”) point to grossly distorted Rab7 and LAMP1 compartments associated with Lh EVs. (F, G) Lb infection does not distort LAMP1 compartment morphologies. Rab5 suppresses proliferation and maintains the macrophage fate We were surprised to find that Pxn>GFP Rab5RNAi animals developed melanized tumors (S8A and S8B Fig); the hematopoietic population is significantly expanded and lamellocyte differentiation is robust, affecting viability (S8C–S8F Fig). (Variability in viability and tumor development in Rab5 KD animals is likely due to differences in the strengths and expression patterns of the GAL4 drivers.) A similar result was observed with the expression of the dominant negative Rab5S43N protein which cannot bind GTP [48]). Rab5 KD even in the lymph gland medullary zone (TepIV>Rab5RNAi) resulted in lamellocyte differentiation (Fig 6A and 6B). Fig 6. Rab5RNAi triggers overproliferation and lamellocyte differentiation.

(MI = 2.2 ± 2.15 in control Pxn>GFP; 2.9 ± 1.1, and 5.5 ± 1.9 in experimental Pxn>GFP, Rab5RNAi animals without and with tumors, respectively (n = 10 for each condition). These results suggest that Rab5 acts as a tumor suppressor and maintains hematopoietic immune quiescence. Control “FLP-out” clones without Rab5RNAi contained small cells that did not express integrin-β; experimental clones with Rab5RNAi had larger, F-actin-rich cells with a typical lamellocyte morphology, that were also integrin-β-positive (Fig 6E–6H). These results suggest that Rab5’s requirement in maintaining the progenitor or macrophage fate is cell-autonomous.",
    "discussion": "Discussion System-wide distribution but specific effects of Lh EVs Parasitism by L. heterotoma has been of interest because of its ability to parasitize many Drosophila hosts and the existence of venom factors that kill host hemocytes. Lb lacks these activities (Fig 7). The discovery of an anti-lamellocyte activity intrinsic to Lh EVs provided initial insights into the critical roles of these EVs in parasitism [20,49]. However, details underlying their apoptotic effects on macrophages have been lacking. This work provides the first view into how Lh EVs rely on the host’s circulation to gain system-wide distribution to not only precisely kill the available effector cells but also to pre-emptively interfere with the host’s ability to produce additional effector cells. We show that lymph glands serve an important, previously unappreciated role in immunity. A majority of lymph gland cells can phagocytose Lh EVs to protect the host from their detrimental effects. EV activities in turn promote their apoptotic death by disrupting their endomembrane system. Fig 7. Lh EV interactions and effects on host blood cells: summary of events. Open in a new tab Left: Immune suppression by Lh and Lb wasps and host defense in response to infection. Text in bold indicates findings from this study. Right: Lb attack triggers NF-κB-dependent signaling events in the PSC and promotes lamellocyte differentiation of lymph gland progenitors (left lobe). This process is important in host defense against parasitic wasps [35,44] and is kept in check by Rab5. After Lh infection (right lobe), Lh MSEVs concentrate around and disassemble the PSC. They are phagocytosed by macrophages by a Rab5-dependent endocytic mechanism. In macrophages, EVs damage the phagolysosomal compartments. They are internalized by lamellocytes independently of Rab5 function. EVs lyse the few lamellocytes that differentiate post infection.This work also lays bare new questions. Lh EVs’ association with the ECM proteins around the lymphatic system cells suggests ways in which EVs might recognize and home into the lymph gland hemocytes and cardiomyocytes although the role of the ECM, the details of their entry and physiological effects on cardiomyocytes are currently unclear. As has been suggested for Slit-carrying vesicles [45], cardiac cells might provide a route for Lh EVs to converge into the vicinity of the PSCs. Once inside lymph gland hemoctytes, they simultaneously target the protective functions of macrophages and lamellocytes and their activities culminate to strongly block encapsulation (Fig 7). These strategies are not uncommon and are likely to be shared by closely related Leptopilina wasps or even unrelated virulent wasps that attack drosophilid and non-drosophilid hosts and are known to destroy their hosts’ hematopoietic cells [50–54]. Lh EVs proactively block encapsulation Studies with Lb showed that the lymph gland itself responds to wasp infection and lamellocytes differentiate from hematopoietic progenitors [8,9,55,56]. In addition to PSC’s niche function in naïve animals [31,32,57–59], the PSC also appears to play an anti-parasite role as Lb infection promotes lamellocyte differentiation [30,35–38,43,60]. Given this latter role, it is reasonable to interpret Lh’s effects on PSC integrity as part of a corresponding adaptive strategy that Lh has acquired during its evolutionary history. The high Lh EV levels around the PSC and its disassembly provide novel physiological insights into PSC functions and raise intriguing mechanistic questions. A normally clustered and cohesive PSC organization is needed for proper hematopoietic differentiation in naïve animals [45]. Although Lh infection-induced PSC disassembly and hemocyte loss are observed together in fixed samples, our data from infected PSC-less animals suggest that PSC disruption might precede hemocyte death. It is possible that the PSC may somehow “recognize” foreign entities and might serve to protect the progenitor microenvironment by acting as a chemical or mechanical barrier between the vascular and hematopoietic cells. In this scenario, Lh EVs may be targeting PSC cohesiveness to inactivate this barrier function. This interpretation is consistent with the recently discovered permeability barrier in the PSC that is breached by systemic bacterial infection. Permeability barrier in the PSC is maintained by septate junctions and their disruption is linked to increased Toll signaling, cellular immune activation and improved host survival [39]. The barrier function between the vascular and hematopoietic cells proposed here would serve to limit the ingress of structures such as microbes and EVs. The mechanisms underlying the effects of ablated PSCs are unclear but it is notable that PSC-less lobes do not respond to either Lb or Lh infections (our results and [36]). Examining whether Lb EVs/venosomes similarly interact with the lymph gland ECM, congregate around the PSC, and are phagocytosed by hemocytes will shed light on these processes. Extracellular vesicles secreted from mammalian neutrophils and endothelial cells can direct cell motility and chemotaxis [61,62]. Thus, it is possible that Lh EV activities [15] are similarly responsible for PSC disassembly. These activities may perturb host pathways required for normal PSC cohesion and function, although manipulating the Slit-Robo pathway components, or hh signaling, hypothesized to disrupt the infection process, was insufficient to block Lh’s ability to disperse the PSC and attack hemocytes. Lh EVs may possess redundant or independent mechanisms to control PSC integrity and this question remains open for further research. A central role for phagocytosis in the anti-parasite response The ability of macrophages to ingest and kill microbes is a fundamental facet of innate immunity. Microbes have evolved to evade or escape the destructive conditions in their host cells’ phagolysosomes. While most intracellular pathogens avoid fusion with lysosomes, others modify endocytic trafficking differently to survive in their host cells [63]. We have shown that like microbes, Lh EVs are endocytosed and can damage the late endocytic compartments. This suggests that their biochemical activities may distort and damage intracellular membranes although how this occurs mechanistically is unclear. A novel family of Lh EV-associated GTPases [15] are possible candidates for such activities as expression of select GTPases in yeast alter vacuolar morphologies [64]. Microbial infection of macrophages can activate apoptosis responses [65–67] and it may be that similar effects of Lh EVs in fly macrophages are directly linked to their apoptosis. Lamellocytes utilize a flotillin/lipid raft dependent mechanism to internalize Lb EVs [68], and it is likely that Lh EVs use the same or a similar pathway. The significance of the nuclear SSp40 signal in lamellocytes after Lh infection is unclear; but because the signal is not punctate, Lh EVs are likely internalized via a membrane fusion step in which their vesicular character is lost. Electron microscopy results also show that unlike macrophages with membrane-enclosed endocytic vesicles containing intact Lh EVs, lamellocytes do not have such compartments, and once internalized, EVs lose structural integrity [49]. Efferocytosis of lysed lamellocytes appears to be an effector anti-parasite response and it may ultimately also be beneficial to parasite development. Our genetic studies with Rab5 highlight the central role of the endocytic processes in the anti-parasite response. Loss of endocytic trafficking activates immune signaling ([69–71]). From a physiological standpoint, it makes sense why the lymph gland is a dedicated target of wasp infections. Both key aspects of anti-wasp cellular immunity, i.e., phagocytosis of the wasp’s EVs and lamellocyte differentiation, unequivocally reside in the lymph gland. These ideas can be further examined at the molecular level with the available descriptions of the Lh and Lb EV proteomes [15,19,23]. Virulence factors provide the armament for parasite success in the host/pathogen “arms race”. Insights from this model host-parasite system can influence our understanding of how parasite-derived factors have shaped the immune physiology of fly hosts.",

Copyright notice ID: 8191917 PMID: 34048506 Abstract The wasps Leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their Drosophila hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for L. heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts’ hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila. The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naïve animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that L. heterotoma infection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of L. heterotoma infection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside, L. heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite’s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for L. heterotoma are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.Author summary Parasitoid wasps serve as biological control agents of agricultural insect pests and are worthy of study. Many parasitic wasps develop inside their hosts to emerge as free-living adults. To overcome the resistance of their hosts, parasitic wasps use varied and ingenious strategies such as mimicry, evasion, bioactive venom, virus-like particles, viruses, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). We describe the effects of a unique class of EVs containing virulence proteins and produced in the venom of wasps that parasitize fruit flies of Drosophila species. EVs from Leptopilina heterotoma are widely distributed throughout the Drosophila hosts’ circulatory system after infection. They enter and kill macrophages by destroying the very same subcellular machinery that facilitates their uptake. An important protein in this process, Rab5, is needed to maintain the identity of the macrophage; when Rab5 function is reduced, macrophages turn into a different cell type called lamellocytes. Activities in the EVs can eliminate lamellocytes as well. EVs also interfere with the hosts’ genetic program that promotes lamellocyte differentiation needed to block parasite development. Thus, wasps combine specific preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete their hosts of the very cells that would otherwise sequester and kill them. These findings have applied value in agricultural pest control and medical therapeutics.Introduction Parasitoid (parasitic) wasps have an obligatory relationship with their insect hosts. Engaged in a biological “arms race,” each partner continuously adapts to the other to emerge alive. For reproductive success, parasitic wasps target their hosts’ behavior, development and immune system. Their attack mechanisms range from biochemical warfare and mimicry, to passive evasion and active immune suppression [1–3]. Drosophila and their parasitic wasps are an emerging model for studying how wasps evade or suppress host defenses [4,5]. The generalist Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh) succeeds on the Drosophila species within and beyond the melanogaster group. Its close relative, L. boulardi (Lb), considered a specialist, mainly infects flies of the melanogaster group. Both wasps are highly successful on D. melanogaster; they consume its developing larval and pupal stages to emerge as free-living adults [6]. Oviposition into second-to-early-third D. melanogaster larval hosts by Lb and Lh wasps yields divergent immunological effects. Lb infection activates many components of humoral and cellular immunity: Toll-NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the melanization pathways and their target genes are transcriptionally upregulated; there is a burst of hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation of blood cells (also called hemocytes) in the lymph gland and in circulation. If the immune responses are strong and sustained, macrophages and lamellocytes encapsulate and kill wasp eggs [7–11]. Lh infection in contrast suppresses immune gene expression and kills immature and mature larval hemocytes [12,13]. Lb and Lh females (and also L. victoriae, a sister species of Lh) produce discrete immune-suppressive extracellular vesicle- (EV) like structures in their venom glands (called multi-strategy extracellular vesicles, MSEVs in Lh and venosomes in Lb) [14,15]. Previously called virus like particles [16–18], these EVs lack clear viral features [15,19]. They are produced in the venom gland, a structure made up of the long gland and a reservoir. The secretory cells of the long gland synthesize and secrete proteins, some of which are initially incorporated into discrete non-spiked vesicle-like structures. In sister species Lh and Lv, these structures mature in the reservoir and assume a stellate morphology with 4–8 spikes radiating from the center. Mature EVs are roughly 300 nm in diameter, [14,16,20–22]. Packed with more than 150 proteins, EVs are, in part, responsible for divergent physiological outcomes in infected hosts [15,19,23]. Among the most abundant in the Lh EV proteins is a 40 kDa surface/spike protein (SSp40) [20]. SSp40 shares structural similarities with the IpaD/SipD family of proteins of the gastroenteric disease-causing Gram negative bacteria, Shigella and Salmonella [15]. Similar to SSp40’s localization to Lh EV spike tips, IpaD localizes to the tips of the T3 secretion injectisome, a bacterial transfer system that injects virulence proteins into mammalian cells. IpaD itself promotes apoptosis of mammalian macrophages [24,25]. These parallels between Lh SSp40 and bacterial IpaD/SipD suggest that Lh EVs may share some similarities with bacterial secretion systems. Comparative transcriptomic/proteomic approaches revealed that SSp40 and a few other EV proteins are not expressed in the Lb venom [15]. Whereas Lh EVs lyse lamellocytes within a few hours of wasp attack, Lb EVs do not have the same effect [7,16,26]. Our immune-inhibition experiments suggested that Lh’s SSp40 mediates EV interactions with lamellocytes [20]. Lh infection also uniquely promotes apoptosis of larval macrophages and of lymph gland hemocytes [13]. Macrophages make up more than 95% of all hematopoietic cells while differentiated lamellocytes are rarely found in naïve hosts [8–10,27]. Work in the field strongly suggests that the protein activities concentrated within the Lh EVs are responsible for the destruction of these mature and immature blood cells. However, how a macro-endoparasite targets the hematopoietic system and accesses its progenitor population has not been studied. The modes of Lh EV entry into these cells and the pathways of destruction are also not well understood. The goal of this study was to obtain a macro-level view of Lh EV interactions with cells of the larval hemolymphatic system after infection. The term hemolymph refers to the interstitial fluid that distributes hormones, peptides and other macromolecules into organs through the pumping action of an unbranched tubular heart, or the dorsal vessel. Dozens of macrophages circulate in the hemolymph. The heart lumen is surrounded by a column of paired cardiomyocytes and associated pericardial cells. This tubular structure is held in place by alary muscles [28–30]. Hematopoietic cells are organized in paired cell clusters (or lobes) on the dorsal vessel. In third instar larvae, the anterior-most lobes have blood cells at various stages of differentiation; the least differentiated progenitors are confined adjacent to the dorsal vessel, whereas the developing macrophages are sequestered in the cortical regions of the lobes (Fig 1A). In naïve hosts, the progenitor state is maintained by a putative niche (also called the posterior signaling center, PSC). The PSC is a tight unit of about 25–50 cells and is positioned posteriorly to the progenitors [31,32]. Upon Lb infection, the PSC reprograms hematopoiesis inducing macrophage and lamellocyte differentiation [30,32–39]. The entire structure is covered by the acellular basement membrane [28,40]. Fig 1. Lh EVs associate with the larval lymphatic system. Open in a new tab (A) Anterior lobes (ALs, without lamellocytes) from a naïve Antp>mCD8GFP Dome-MESO-GFP (AntpDMG) animal shows medullary zone (MZ), cortical zone (CZ) and posterior signaling center (PSC).

(I-K) Posterior lobes from uninfected (I) and Lh-infected animals (J, K). (L) Circulating hemocytes from infected animals.Using Drosophila genetics, cell-specific markers and SSp40 staining as a proxy for Lh EV localization, we have pieced together a broad view of this host-parasite interaction interface. We show an abundance of Lh EVs in (a) the lumen of the larval dorsal vessel, (b) along the collagen/perlecan-based basement membrane around the dorsal vessel and surrounding clusters of lymph gland progenitors, and (c) inside the progenitor and mature macrophages. Moreover, high EV signal correlates with the disassembly of the cohesive PSC unit. PSC ablation limits EV internalization and loss of lymph gland hemocytes, while PSC inactivation via hedgehog (hh) knockdown (KD) does not have this effect. We also show that lymph gland hemocytes can phagocytose Lh EVs using the classical Rab5-mediated retrograde transport (RGT) pathway. Surprisingly, Rab5 also maintains fly macrophage identity, as Rab5 KD leads to over-proliferation, lamellocyte differentiation and tumorigenesis; Rab5 function is cell-autonomous. Thus lymph glands are not merely a source of mature blood cells but are themselves immune competent organs and can clear the immune-suppressive Lh EVs to defend the host. However, Lh EVs proactively dislodge cells of the PSC, blocking differentiation of the protective immune cells. Lh EVs target the endomembrane system of macrophages that ultimately results in their apoptosis, thus highlighting central and previously unrecognized roles of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. These observations help explain why Lh infections target the larval lymph gland. The direct EV-macrophage interactions and cellular outcomes set the stage for future molecular analyses in both the hosts and parasites.Results Lh EVs are present within the larval lymphatic system Lb17 attack triggers lamellocyte differentiation in the larval lymph gland cortex (Fig 1A–1C). At an equivalent time-point, Lh-infected lobes are significantly smaller (Fig 1D–1K); [13]. Surprisingly, unlike Antp>mCD8GFP-expressing PSCs of naïve and Lb-infected lobes that remain tightly clustered (Fig 1A–1C), PSC cells of Lh-infected hosts are dislodged and some are distributed in the body of the lobe (Fig 1D). To understand these responses, we imaged more than 25 hosts in multiple experiments. Throughout these studies, we used a polyclonal antibody to mark SSp40, an Lh EV-specific protein [20]. Lh infection of Pxn>GFP animals reduced Pxn>GFP expression (Fig 1E–1H). (Pxn is normally active in the cortex and its expression mimics that of many other genes downregulated by Lh infection [7]). An abundance of Lh EVs was observed in anterior- and posterior-lobe hemocytes, in the dorsal vessel, and in circulating hemocytes (Fig 1F–1H and 1J–1L). This staining signal is absent in glands from naïve animals (Fig 1E and 1I). Thus, Lb and Lh attack have drastically different outcomes and Lh EVs appear to interact directly with most lymph gland hemocytes. In our analyses across experiments, we found that the degree of tissue loss and EV distribution varies. Lobe morphologies ranged from nearly intact and filled with EVs (Fig 1F and 1J) to damaged lobes, with few to many EVs (Fig 1G, 1H and 1K). This variation is likely due to (a) the duration of infection (i.e., time between oviposition and dissection); (b) the injected EV dose; or (c) the dynamics of EV circulation. Dissections at later time points showed loss of almost all lymph gland hemocytes [13]. To then probe how Lh EVs enter the lymphatic system, we stained Lh-infected glands from fly strains with GFP-tagged Collagen IV (basement membrane, Viking [41]) or GFP-tagged proteoglycan core protein, Perlecan/Trol [42]. In both cases, EV puncta were clearly localized with the continuous GFP signals of these extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins along the dorsal vessel as well as in the interstitial spaces around clustered hematopoietic progenitors (yellow puncta in Fig 2A–2D’ arrows). Surprisingly, punctate staining was also seen inside immature progenitors, adjacent to the dorsal vessel (Fig 2B, 2B’ 2D and 2D’). EVs were also observed inside some cardiomyocytes as evidenced by SSp40 colocalization with the mCD8GFP signal in HandΔ>mCD8GFP larvae (Fig 2E–2F’, arrows). Thus, Lh EVs associate with ECM proteins of the lymphatic system, enter the dorsal vessel lumen and even some cardiomyocytes. Fig 2. Lh EVs associate with basement membrane proteins.

(F, F’, arrows) EV signal localizes with the GFP signal in the cardiomyocytes.Effects of Lh infection on PSC integrity Previous studies have demonstrated that upon Lb infection, the PSC reprograms hematopoietic development and promotes lamellocyte differentiation. Similar to controls, Lb infected PSCs remain tightly clustered [35,37,38,43,44]. We found that regardless of the Lh strain, PSC cells dislodged from their normal posterior position into the body of the lobe (Figs 1D and S1A and S1B). At the time points we examined, half of the PSC cells relocated into the lobe, of which an overwhelming majority (> 95%) were present as single cells or as groups of two cells. The other half remained in their original place, although some were not as tightly clustered (Figs 1D and S1; n = 24 PSCs from 12 lymph glands). As expected, in 14 lobes from naïve controls, all PSC cells were tightly packed. Strikingly, in samples from infected animals, where the PSCs were still intact, EVs congregated in regions adjacent to the PSC, but were never found inside the PSC cells (S1A and S1B Fig). The Slit ligand, originating from adjacent cardiomyocytes, controls PSC integrity via the Robo receptors in the PSC; Robo2 has the strongest effect [45]. Indeed, the effect of Lh infection on the PSC resembles Slit/Robo2 KD, which promotes PSC disassembly [45] (Figs 1 and S1). A cohesive PSC is important in hematopoietic development as fewer macrophages and crystal cells develop in Slit/Robo2 KD lobes compared to controls. But differing from Lh infection, Slit KD PSCs are larger and there is no apparent loss of progenitors [45]. In spite of different outcomes in the two conditions, we hypothesized that the initial steps might be shared and that Lh EVs might inactivate the Slit-Robo signal, which might explain PSC disassembly. To test this idea, we infected animals in which the Slit-Robo pathway was manipulated to promote constitutive signaling. We found that neither expressing active Slit nor overexpressing Robo2 altered Lh EVs’ ability to disassemble the PSC. Lh infection of HandΔ>Slit-N animals still promoted PSC disassembly (S2A–S2C’ Fig; n = 16 lobes) even though gain-of-function Slit-N [46] reverses the effects of Slit KD [45]. Similarly, Lh infection bypassed the effects of Robo2 overexpression (Antp>Robo2-HA) and promoted PSC disassembly S2D–S2F’ Fig). Many EVs are observed around these PSCs (S3 Fig; n = 16). Thus, either EVs inactivate PSC function independently of the Slit-Robo signal, or they possess redundant mechanisms that disable constitutive Slit-Robo signaling.PSC-less lymph glands remain intact PSC-less lymph glands were unable to induce lamellocyte differentiation after Lb infection [36]. We asked if ablating the PSC might similarly inhibit the Lh infection responses. PSC-less lobes (Col>Hid) lacked Antp staining and Lh14 infection did not affect lobe integrity (S4A–S4D’ Fig; n > 12 lobes). Moreover, while Lh-infected UAS-Hid lobes lost progenitors and exhibited high levels of EV uptake (Fig 3A, 3B, 3D and 3E), Lh-infected PSC-less lobes remained intact and showed low, non-specific SSp40 staining signal in anterior and posterior lobes (Fig 3C and 3F; n > 12 lobes for each condition). In contrast to the non-responsive Col>Hid lobes, Antp>hhRNAi lobes responded to Lh infection and suffered progenitor cell loss (S5A–S5F Fig; n > 12 lobes for each condition). Thus, inactivating the signaling function of the PSC does not appear to affect the wasp’s ability to disassemble the PSC. P1 staining revealed that Lh infection does not block macrophage differentiation (S5C Fig). Taken together, these results suggest that the PSC plays a structural role in trafficking of EVs from either the hemolymph or the dorsal vessel into the lobes and that the cell-lethal effects of Lh EVs is distinct from the PSC’s niche function. Fig 3. PSC-less lymph glands from Lh-infected animals have intact lobes. Open in a new tab (A, D) Lobes from a naïve UAS-Hid host are intact and lack EVs; anterior (A), and posterior lobes (D). (B, E) Lymph gland from a Lh-infected UAS-Hid host is depleted of hemocytes and has many EVs. Anterior lobes (B, B’), and posterior lobes (E, E’). (C, F) PSC-less lobes from a Lh-infected Col>Hid host are intact with weak EV signal. Anterior (C, C’), and posterior lobes (F, F’).The larval lymph gland is phagocytically competent We next studied if EV uptake into hematopoietic cells occurs via RGT mechanisms. In Pxn>GFP; +/Bc heterozygous lymph glands, we observed blackened, dead crystal cells in the cytoplasm of the GFP-positive cortical cells (S6 Fig). This observation suggests that GFP-positive lymph gland cells are phagocytically competent. We therefore investigated if Lh EV uptake depends on Rab5, an early endosomal protein. Rab5 mediates trafficking from the plasma membrane to early endosomes [47]. In contrast to Pxn>GFP macrophages, where EV staining is bright and punctate throughout the cytoplasm (Fig 4A and 4B), Pxn>GFP, Rab5RNAi cells show peripheral punctate staining, presumably from intact EVs, trapped in early endosomes, both in lymph gland and circulating hemocytes (Fig 4C and 4D; arrows). In lamellocytes, the EV signal is diffuse and nuclear, and Rab5 KD shows no change in staining intensity or distribution (Fig 4E and 4F; arrowheads), suggesting that Rab5-independent uptake mechanisms are involved. msn-GFP- and integrin-β-positive lamellocyte fragments were also observed in Lh-infected macrophages suggesting occurrence of efferocytosis (S7 Fig).

A larger Phalloidin-positive lamellocyte (arrowhead) remains EV negative, while smaller macrophages endocytose EVs. The EV signal is peripheral in some, but not all macrophages (C, D). (E, F) Anterior l Lobes (E-E”) and circulating hemocytes (F-F”) from Lh-infected GFP-positive lamellocytes of hopTum-l msn>mCD8GFP, Rab5RNAi animals. Lamellocytes show a diffuse nuclear SSp40 signal (arrowhead). Lh EVs negatively impact phagolysosomal organization in macrophages Rab7 mediates late endosome formation and trafficking between late endosomes and lysosomes is marked by Rab7 and LAMP1, respectively [47]. To evaluate if Lh EVs impact the RGT machinery, infected glands expressing GFP-tagged Rab5, Rab7, or LAMP1 proteins were examined (Fig 5). Under our experimental conditions, Lh EVs rarely colocalized with early endosomes and Rab5 compartment morphology remained comparable to uninfected controls (only 14% of SSp40 puncta are Rab5-positive; n = 221 cells; 6 lobes; Fig 5A–5C). In contrast, Lh EVs were consistently found with GFP-Rab7 and GFP-LAMP1 and these compartments were grossly distorted (100% co-localization; n = 115 and 112 cells, Rab7 and LAMP, respectively, 6 lobes each; Fig 5D–5E”). Moreover, the Rab7/EV and LAMP1/EV signals were asymmetrically localized in Lh-affected cells. In contrast, Lb infection did not distort LAMP-positive compartments and they retained their normal morphology (Fig 5F and 5G). These observations suggest that high numbers of Lh EVs transit through early endosomes, but that they are retained in late RGT compartments including lysosomes. Thus, Lh EVs have a detrimental effect on RGT compartment integrity and this loss of integrity may promote lysosomal leakage and labilization. Fig 5.

Square brackets (D’,D”, E’,E”) point to grossly distorted Rab7 and LAMP1 compartments associated with Lh EVs.

(Variability in viability and tumor development in Rab5 KD animals is likely due to differences in the strengths and expression patterns of the GAL4 drivers.) A similar result was observed with the expression of the dominant negative Rab5S43N protein which cannot bind GTP [48]). Rab5 KD even in the lymph gland medullary zone (TepIV>Rab5RNAi) resulted in lamellocyte differentiation (Fig 6A and 6B). Fig 6. Rab5RNAi triggers overproliferation and lamellocyte differentiation.

In panel H, the GFP and integrin-β signals overlap in some cells confirming lamellocyte identity (arrow in inset).Hematopoietic expansion correlated with increased mitotic index (MI) in lobes of tumor-bearing Pxn>GFP Rab5RNAi animals (Fig 6C and 6D) suggesting that normal Rab5 function checks over-proliferation and ectopic progenitor differentiation. (MI = 2.2 ± 2.15 in control Pxn>GFP; 2.9 ± 1.1, and 5.5 ± 1.9 in experimental Pxn>GFP, Rab5RNAi animals without and with tumors, respectively (n = 10 for each condition). These results suggest that Rab5 acts as a tumor suppressor and maintains hematopoietic immune quiescence. Control “FLP-out” clones without Rab5RNAi contained small cells that did not express integrin-β; experimental clones with Rab5RNAi had larger, F-actin-rich cells with a typical lamellocyte morphology, that were also integrin-β-positive (Fig 6E–6H). These results suggest that Rab5’s requirement in maintaining the progenitor or macrophage fate is cell-autonomous.Discussion System-wide distribution but specific effects of Lh EVs Parasitism by L. heterotoma has been of interest because of its ability to parasitize many Drosophila hosts and the existence of venom factors that kill host hemocytes. Lb lacks these activities (Fig 7). The discovery of an anti-lamellocyte activity intrinsic to Lh EVs provided initial insights into the critical roles of these EVs in parasitism [20,49]. However, details underlying their apoptotic effects on macrophages have been lacking. This work provides the first view into how Lh EVs rely on the host’s circulation to gain system-wide distribution to not only precisely kill the available effector cells but also to pre-emptively interfere with the host’s ability to produce additional effector cells. We show that lymph glands serve an important, previously unappreciated role in immunity. A majority of lymph gland cells can phagocytose Lh EVs to protect the host from their detrimental effects. EV activities in turn promote their apoptotic death by disrupting their endomembrane system. Fig 7. Lh EV interactions and effects on host blood cells: summary of events. Open in a new tab Left: Immune suppression by Lh and Lb wasps and host defense in response to infection. Text in bold indicates findings from this study. Right: Lb attack triggers NF-κB-dependent signaling events in the PSC and promotes lamellocyte differentiation of lymph gland progenitors (left lobe). This process is important in host defense against parasitic wasps [35,44] and is kept in check by Rab5. After Lh infection (right lobe), Lh MSEVs concentrate around and disassemble the PSC. They are phagocytosed by macrophages by a Rab5-dependent endocytic mechanism. In macrophages, EVs damage the phagolysosomal compartments. They are internalized by lamellocytes independently of Rab5 function. EVs lyse the few lamellocytes that differentiate post infection.This work also lays bare new questions. Lh EVs’ association with the ECM proteins around the lymphatic system cells suggests ways in which EVs might recognize and home into the lymph gland hemocytes and cardiomyocytes although the role of the ECM, the details of their entry and physiological effects on cardiomyocytes are currently unclear. As has been suggested for Slit-carrying vesicles [45], cardiac cells might provide a route for Lh EVs to converge into the vicinity of the PSCs. Once inside lymph gland hemoctytes, they simultaneously target the protective functions of macrophages and lamellocytes and their activities culminate to strongly block encapsulation (Fig 7). These strategies are not uncommon and are likely to be shared by closely related Leptopilina wasps or even unrelated virulent wasps that attack drosophilid and non-drosophilid hosts and are known to destroy their hosts’ hematopoietic cells [50–54]. Lh EVs proactively block encapsulation Studies with Lb showed that the lymph gland itself responds to wasp infection and lamellocytes differentiate from hematopoietic progenitors [8,9,55,56]. In addition to PSC’s niche function in naïve animals [31,32,57–59], the PSC also appears to play an anti-parasite role as Lb infection promotes lamellocyte differentiation [30,35–38,43,60]. Given this latter role, it is reasonable to interpret Lh’s effects on PSC integrity as part of a corresponding adaptive strategy that Lh has acquired during its evolutionary history. The high Lh EV levels around the PSC and its disassembly provide novel physiological insights into PSC functions and raise intriguing mechanistic questions. A normally clustered and cohesive PSC organization is needed for proper hematopoietic differentiation in naïve animals [45]. Although Lh infection-induced PSC disassembly and hemocyte loss are observed together in fixed samples, our data from infected PSC-less animals suggest that PSC disruption might precede hemocyte death. It is possible that the PSC may somehow “recognize” foreign entities and might serve to protect the progenitor microenvironment by acting as a chemical or mechanical barrier between the vascular and hematopoietic cells. In this scenario, Lh EVs may be targeting PSC cohesiveness to inactivate this barrier function. This interpretation is consistent with the recently discovered permeability barrier in the PSC that is breached by systemic bacterial infection. Permeability barrier in the PSC is maintained by septate junctions and their disruption is linked to increased Toll signaling, cellular immune activation and improved host survival [39]. The barrier function between the vascular and hematopoietic cells proposed here would serve to limit the ingress of structures such as microbes and EVs. The mechanisms underlying the effects of ablated PSCs are unclear but it is notable that PSC-less lobes do not respond to either Lb or Lh infections (our results and [36]). Examining whether Lb EVs/venosomes similarly interact with the lymph gland ECM, congregate around the PSC, and are phagocytosed by hemocytes will shed light on these processes. Extracellular vesicles secreted from mammalian neutrophils and endothelial cells can direct cell motility and chemotaxis [61,62]. Thus, it is possible that Lh EV activities [15] are similarly responsible for PSC disassembly. These activities may perturb host pathways required for normal PSC cohesion and function, although manipulating the Slit-Robo pathway components, or hh signaling, hypothesized to disrupt the infection process, was insufficient to block Lh’s ability to disperse the PSC and attack hemocytes. Lh EVs may possess redundant or independent mechanisms to control PSC integrity and this question remains open for further research.A central role for phagocytosis in the anti-parasite response The ability of macrophages to ingest and kill microbes is a fundamental facet of innate immunity. Microbes have evolved to evade or escape the destructive conditions in their host cells’ phagolysosomes. While most intracellular pathogens avoid fusion with lysosomes, others modify endocytic trafficking differently to survive in their host cells [63]. We have shown that like microbes, Lh EVs are endocytosed and can damage the late endocytic compartments. This suggests that their biochemical activities may distort and damage intracellular membranes although how this occurs mechanistically is unclear. A novel family of Lh EV-associated GTPases [15] are possible candidates for such activities as expression of select GTPases in yeast alter vacuolar morphologies [64]. Microbial infection of macrophages can activate apoptosis responses [65–67] and it may be that similar effects of Lh EVs in fly macrophages are directly linked to their apoptosis. Lamellocytes utilize a flotillin/lipid raft dependent mechanism to internalize Lb EVs [68], and it is likely that Lh EVs use the same or a similar pathway. The significance of the nuclear SSp40 signal in lamellocytes after Lh infection is unclear; but because the signal is not punctate, Lh EVs are likely internalized via a membrane fusion step in which their vesicular character is lost. Electron microscopy results also show that unlike macrophages with membrane-enclosed endocytic vesicles containing intact Lh EVs, lamellocytes do not have such compartments, and once internalized, EVs lose structural integrity [49]. Efferocytosis of lysed lamellocytes appears to be an effector anti-parasite response and it may ultimately also be beneficial to parasite development. Our genetic studies with Rab5 highlight the central role of the endocytic processes in the anti-parasite response. Loss of endocytic trafficking activates immune signaling ([69–71]). From a physiological standpoint, it makes sense why the lymph gland is a dedicated target of wasp infections. Both key aspects of anti-wasp cellular immunity, i.e., phagocytosis of the wasp’s EVs and lamellocyte differentiation, unequivocally reside in the lymph gland. These ideas can be further examined at the molecular level with the available descriptions of the Lh and Lb EV proteomes [15,19,23]. Virulence factors provide the armament for parasite success in the host/pathogen “arms race”. Insights from this model host-parasite system can influence our understanding of how parasite-derived factors have shaped the immune physiology of fly hosts.Materials and methods Stocks and crosses All D. melanogaster stocks were raised on standard fly medium containing cornmeal flour, sucrose, yeast, and agar at 25°C.

The truncated HandΔ promoter is active in cardiomyocytes of the dorsal vessel ([73], from M. Crozatier). Hemocyte drivers were: Pxn-GAL4, UAS-GFP ([74], from U. Banerjee); Hemese-GAL4 (He-GAL4) ([75], from D. Hultmark); eater (ea)-GAL4 ([76], from R.A. Schulz); Collagen-GAL4 (Cg>GFP) ([77], from C. Dearolf); Serpent (Srp)-GAL4 [78] and TepIV-GAL4 [79] (both from N. Fossett); Hemolectin-GAL4 (Hml>GFP) ([80], from J-M. Reichhart). UAS lines: The UAS-Slit-N ([46]; Slit gain-of-function) and UAS-Robo2-HA (for overexpression of Robo2, [81]) lines were obtained from T. Volk and T. Kidd. Strains from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center: UAS-Rab5RNAi (#30518); UAS-GFP-Rab5 (#43336) [82]; UAS-GFP-Rab7 (#42706); UAS-Rab5.S43N (#42704); UAS-GFP-LAMP; nSyb-GAL4/CyO:TM6B (#42714) [83], and UAS-hhRNAi (#25794) [84]). Other lines: A homozygous Bc stock devoid of other mutations (from B. Lemaitre [85]) was balanced with CyO-GFP for crosses with the homozygous Pxn-GAL4, UAS-GFP strain. Protein trap lines were: Collagen IV (Viking) and perlecan (Trol) (from A. Spradling and L. Cooley). In the hhf4f-GFP; Antp-GAL4/TM6 Tb Hu strain, the PSC is marked (from R.A. Schulz). In the Dome-MESO-GFP strain, the lymph gland medulla is GFP positive ([86], from M. Crozatier). We recombined this latter insertion with the Antp-GAL4 insertion to make a UAS-mCD8GFP; Antp-GAL4, Dome-MESO-GFP (AntpDMG) stock. hopTum-l, msn-GAL4; UAS-mCD8GFP [87] uses the misshapen (msn) driver to mark lamellocytes [88]. For PSC-less animals, UAS-Hid [89] females were crossed with Collier-GAL4/CyO y+ males. For FLP-out clones [90], hsp70-flp; Actin>CD2>GAL4 flies were crossed with the Rab5RNAi flies; progeny was heat shocked at 37°C as described [38]. UAS-GAL4 crosses were maintained at 27°C.Wasp infections y w flies were used to rear wasps. Unless specified otherwise, infections were done with either Lb17 or Lh14 [7]. LhNY [20] was used to validate results with the Lh14 strain. Ten to twelve trained female wasps were introduced to hosts from a 12-hr egg-lay. Hosts were allowed to recover after an 8–12 hr infection. Dissections were typically done one-to-two days after infection. Uninfected controls followed the same timeline. In general, longer infection regimes led to stronger responses: more lamellocytes differentiated after Lb infection and more lobe cells were lost after Lh infection. Under our experimental conditions, superparasitism by either wasp was rare and for our analyses, we avoided hosts with more than one parasite.Immunohistochemistry Antibody staining was performed according to [91]. Primary mouse anti-SSp40 (1:1000) [20] and Cy3 AffiniPure donkey anti-mouse secondary (1:200) (Jackson Immuno Research) were used to detect Lh EVs. Mouse anti-Antennapedia (1:10; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank 8C11, [92] and macrophage-specific mouse anti-P1 (1:20; I. Ando [93]) were similarly detected. Nuclear dye (Hoechst 33258, Invitrogen, 1:500) and Rhodamine or Alexa Fluor 488-tagged Phalloidin (Invitrogen) were used for counterstaining cells. For mitotic index, rabbit anti-phospho-histone3 (1:200 Molecular Probes)-positive hemocytes were scored in randomly selected 1000 μm2 areas of imaged lobes. Samples were mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories). Lamellocytes were visualized by (a) high F-actin staining signal, (b) integrin-β (1:200, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank CF.6G11 [94]) expression, or (c) msnf9-GFP expression [88]. Representative results from twelve or more dissections from at least three independent experiments are presented, unless specified otherwise.Confocal imaging Mounted samples were imaged with Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscopes LSM 510 or LSM 710. For each experiment, images were scanned on the same microscope with the same software and scan settings. Images were gathered at 0.8 μm -1.5 μm and recorded at 8 bit. Laser amplifier gain and offset values were set with negative controls lacking either primary antibodies or wasp infection. Images were processed with Zeiss LSM image browser or Zen Lite 2012. Figures were assembled in Adobe Photoshop v12.0.4 and CC 2015.5 or Illustrator CC 2015.3.Supporting information S1 Fig. Lh EVs congregate around and disassemble PSCs.(A, B) SSp40 staining of lymph glands from Lh14- (A-A”) or LhNY-infected (B-B”) Antp>mCD8GFP hosts.
