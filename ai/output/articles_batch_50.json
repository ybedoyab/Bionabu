    "abstract": "Significance Exercise is a powerful antiaging intervention that protects against cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, sarcopenia, and cancer. How exercise promotes health benefits to multiple tissues in the body, however, remains poorly understood. We establish a young adult swim exercise regimen for the short-lived nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that induces health benefits at the neuromuscular, intestinal, and cognitive levels and protects against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Importantly, we found that swim exercise performed exclusively in early adulthood promotes long-lasting systemic benefits that are still detectable in midlife. The advantages of C. elegans as a short-lived genetic model will allow for dissection of the molecular circuitry involved in system-wide exercise benefits.

The C. elegans strains used in this study were: N2 (WT strain), SJ4103 zcIs14[Pmyo-3mitoGFP] (61), BR6563 byIs161[Prab-3F3ΔK280; Pmyo-2mCherry]; bkIs10[Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M; Pmyo-2GFP] (43), BR5707 byIs161[Prab-3F3ΔK280; Pmyo-2mCherry]; bkIs10[Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M; Pmyo-2GFP]; juIs73[Punc-25GFP] III (43), CL2355 smg-1(cc546ts) dvIs50[Psnb-1Aβ1–42::long 3′-UTR Pmtl-2GFP] I (45), and ID1 igIs1[Pmec-3htt57Q128::CFP, Pmec-7YFP, lin-15(+)] (46). We maintained nematodes at 20 °C on NGM plates seeded with live E. coli OP50-1, as previously described (62), unless otherwise stated. Long-Term Swim Exercise Protocols. We used 2 different methods for our long-term swim exercise experiments: The picking method and the washing method. We performed the picking method for all of the experiments presented in this study, except for the oxygen consumption rates and associative learning assays in which we used the washing method due to the high number of animals required for each assay. Details are in SI Appendix. Other Assays. Detailed information about all of the other assays we performed (qPCR, maximum and mean velocity, microfluidic assay, burrowing assay, confocal microscopy, oxygen consumption rates, lifespan assay, pharyngeal pumping rate, Smurf assay, learning assay, chemotaxis assay, and touch-sensitivity assay) can be found in SI Appendix. Statistical Analyses. The data in this study are presented as the mean ± SEM. We performed a minimum of 3 independent trials for each experiment. The specific number of data points and the test used for each statistical analysis are detailed in SI Appendix.",
    "results": "Results Multiple Daily Swim Sessions Are Essential for C. elegans Exercise Adaptation. Although a single 90-min swim session in C. elegans induces key features of mammalian exercise (13), most exercise-dependent health benefits in humans arise from long-term training regimens that lead to exercise adaptation over time (19); thus, we sought to develop and validate a long-term C. elegans exercise protocol. We planned to determine an efficacious long-term exercise regimen in C. elegans by characterizing the impact of different numbers of 90-min swim sessions in M9 buffer executed over the first 4 d of adult life (Fig. 1A), a period that corresponds to the peak locomotory performance phase and constitutes a timeframe over which C. elegans are able to complete 90-min swims without any significant inactive periods (9, 10, 20). We tested long-term exercise regimens with swim frequencies of 1 session per day (1+1+1+1), 2 sessions per day (2+2+2+2), 3 sessions per day on the first 2 d of adulthood plus 2 sessions per day on the third and fourth adult days (3+3+2+2), 3 sessions per day (3+3+3+3), and 4 sessions per day (4+4+4+4) (Fig. 1B). The exercise adaptation readouts we quantitated included both a molecular assay (gene-expression analysis by qPCR) and a functional assay (locomotion analysis by recording movement and calculating crawling maximum velocity). Importantly, given that our interest is in defining regimens that lead to medium- to long-term physiological changes (i.e., exercise adaptation and system-wide health benefits), we assayed molecular and functional readouts 1 to several days postexercise, rather than immediately after the last swim session. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Multiple daily swim sessions are essential for C. elegans exercise adaptation. (A) Diagram of the 90-min swim session protocol performed for each exercise bout. We transferred control animals to an unseeded NGM plate for 90 min, whereas exercise animals were transferred to an unseeded NGM plate flooded with M9 buffer for the same 90 min to swim. (B) Diagram indicating the time of the day of each exercise session for the 5 long-term exercise regimens tested. (C) qPCR results for 10 muscle structural genes in Ad5 WT animals exposed to the 5 long-term exercise regimens indicated. n = 4 to 5 independent trials. (D) Percentage increase in crawling maximum velocity in Ad5 and Ad8 WT exercised animals exposed to the 5 tested long-term exercise regimens, relative to nonexercised control counterparts. n = 3 to 6 independent trials. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01.Our previous analysis of single swim sessions supported that swimming is an endurance-like exercise for C. elegans (13). In mammals, long-term endurance exercise leads to profound transcriptional changes at the muscle level, with up-regulation of muscle structural genes, such as troponins, tropomyosins, myosin light chains, and myosin heavy chains, as one of the reproducible changes (21–23). Therefore, we first wanted to determine if long-term swim exercise regimens could also promote the up-regulation of muscle structural gene expression in C. elegans. We selected 10 C. elegans genes that included the major structural gene classes found to be up-regulated in mammals in an exercise-dependent manner (SI Appendix, Table S1) (24). Importantly, all of the genes we included in our analysis have been documented to be massively down-regulated with age in C. elegans (24), which underscores their potential importance in age-associated sarcopenia and locomotory decline. We performed qPCR for the test swim regimens 1 d after the training was completed, which corresponds to adult day 5 (Ad5) (Fig. 1C). We found that the 1+1+1+1 regimen led to an overall tendency of down-regulation across the muscle structural gene test set, supporting that single daily swim sessions are insufficient to induce exercise adaptations (at least at the molecular level). In contrast, 2+2+2+2, 3+3+2+2, and 3+3+3+3 regimens led to an overall up-regulation of muscle structural gene expression. The 3+3+2+2 regimen induced the most consistent transcriptional up-regulation profile with 6 of the 10 test genes (tnt-2, unc-27, mlc-1, unc-54, zig-12, and unc-87) exhibiting a statistically significant difference when compared to the control animals. We noted up-regulation of 4 of the 10 genes after just 2 d of training (3+3 regimen) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A); muscle structural gene expression of 3+3+2+2 exercised animals returned to approximately control levels by Ad8 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). The 4+4+4+4 regimen induced a wider range of transcriptional outcomes (2 genes showing a significant up-regulation [tnt-2 and unc-27] and 2 genes showing a significant down-regulation [unc-15 and myo-3]) and reflected a trend toward down-regulation that suggested excessive exercise can be deleterious to maintained muscle expression (Fig. 1C). Overall, our data establish that a training plan of 3+3+2+2 can induce increased transcription of a battery of C. elegans muscle structural genes, paralleling a feature of mammalian exercise adaptation. To assess training impact on muscle performance, we also measured a functional readout of our long-term C. elegans exercise regimens. We focused on the C. elegans crawling maximum velocity since this parameter has been documented to accurately report movement ability, correlates well with healthspan, and can even be a longevity predictor at certain ages (10). We measured maximum velocity by placing Ad5 and Ad8 single animals on agar plates and determining the maximum speed at which they move over a 30-s time interval. Note that our swim-exercised animals were not specifically trained for enhancement of crawling maximum velocity, so maximum velocity serves as an indicator of overall vigor that results from swim training. The 1+1+1+1 regimen failed to significantly increase maximum velocity of exercised animals compared to controls on both days (Fig. 1D), independently supporting our conclusion from transcriptional studies that single daily swim sessions are not sufficient to induce long-term exercise adaptations. In contrast, we found that all of the multiple daily swim regimens promoted a significant increase in maximum velocity, on the order of a 10 to 20% increase over nonexercised animals assayed at Ad5 (Fig. 1D). We found a trend toward increased maximum velocity on Ad8 (4 d after cessation of training) for all 4 multiple daily swim regimens, but only the 3+3+2+2 regimen led to a statistically significant 24% increase (Fig. 1D; see SI Appendix, Fig. S1C for all maximum velocity values). Our findings reveal a remarkable long-term benefit of sustained early adult life exercise training. Overall, the molecular and functional readouts we tested establish that multiple daily swim sessions are required in WT C. elegans for robust exercise adaptation at molecular and functional levels, with the 3+3+2+2 regimen inducing improvements in multiple assays that could feature long-term functional maintenance. Molecular and Functional Changes Are Dependent on Increased Locomotor Activity Rather than Exposure to a Liquid Environment. We showed previously that a single swim session induces specific exercise-dependent acute responses and does not activate a generalized stress response due to liquid exposure (13). Nevertheless, it remained possible that continuous reexposure of C. elegans to the M9 buffer liquid environment during the long-term exercise regimens might induce some physiological benefits. To definitively rule out simple liquid exposure as an important factor for the molecular and functional changes we documented above, we constructed microfluidic devices in which C. elegans can be exposed to M9 buffer but for which we could manipulate the locomotion type (crawling vs. swimming) by modulating the chamber height (25). To test whether exposure to the M9 buffer swim media might suffice to induce exercise adaptations, we performed the 3+3+2+2 regimen by transferring C. elegans from seeded nematode growth medium (NGM) plates to M9 buffer-filled microfluidic devices that had a large chamber height (swim exercise possible) (Movie S1) or a small chamber height (control, animals are sedate and crawl rather than swim) (Movie S2) for 90 min. After each 90-min session, we recovered animals from the microfluidic chambers and returned them to seeded NGM plates. We conducted qPCR analysis at Ad5 to find that microfluidics-exercised C. elegans up-regulate muscle structural genes (statistically significant for tnt-2, mlc-1, unc-54, and zig-12) as compared to microfluidics-constrained control animals (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A), similar to the outcomes of the 3+3+2+2 regimen performed on NGM plates (Fig. 1C). We also determined that muscle structural gene expression was not up-regulated in microfluidics-control animals relative to plate-control animals (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B), confirming that liquid exposure is not sufficient for muscle transcriptional induction. Importantly, we found that the microfluidics-exercised animals exhibited a significant increase in maximum velocity on Ad8 relative to microfluidics nonexercised animals, similar to the 3+3+2+2 regimen implemented by flooding plates with M9 buffer (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). Our data establish that transcriptional and functional changes induced in M9 buffer require swim activity rather than being the consequence of liquid exposure, and independently confirm that long-term swim regimens induce exercise adaptations. Long-Term Swim Exercise Improves Performance and Healthspan of C. elegans Body Wall Muscle. The C. elegans body wall muscle is the tissue most directly involved in long-term exercise training and thus we sought to characterize additional aspects of body wall muscle performance and health consequent to exercise. We recently developed a burrowing assay, in which nematodes are stimulated to move through a Pluronic F-127 gel (a hydrogel that transitions from liquid to gel at safe temperatures for C. elegans survival) toward a chemoattractant (26). We loaded liquid-phase Pluronic F-127 on top of C. elegans in 12-well plates, and allowed the Pluronic F-127 to quickly gel at room temperature, trapping animals under the gel. We then added Escherichia coli OP50-1 on top of the gel, which serves as a food attractant (assay diagram in Fig. 2A). In this 3D gel environment, animals with a better neuromuscular performance reach the surface faster and in higher numbers (26). After a 3+3+2+2 training regimen, Ad5 exercised nematodes reached the gel surface at a significantly higher proportion during the 3-h burrowing assay window as compared to their nonexercised control counterparts (Fig. 2B). Exercised animals have similar chemotactic ability toward E. coli OP50-1 relative to control animals in standard 2D chemotaxis assays on agar plates, supporting similar attraction to OP50-1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). The burrowing data constitute an additional line of evidence that long-term swim exercise improves the functional general output of C. elegans body wall muscle. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Long-term swim exercise improves burrowing performance and mitochondrial profiles of body wall muscle. (A) Diagram of burrowing assay. After the 3+3+2+2 regimen, we trapped Ad5 animals under a Pluronic F-127 gel and added attractant food E. coli OP50-1 to the center of the gel surface. Animals are attracted by the food and burrow to the surface of the gel at different rates. (B) Proportion of Ad5 WT animals exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen that reach the gel surface during the 3-h burrowing assay. n = 370 to 392 animals. (C) Representative confocal images of the 5 classes of body wall muscle mitochondrial network organization in Pmyo-3mitoGFP animals. Fragmentation and disorganization of muscle mitochondria increases progressively from class 1 to class 5. (Scale bar, 10 µm.) (D) Distribution of mitochondrial classes in body wall muscle of Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11 Pmyo-3mitoGFP animals exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. n = 160 to 170 muscle images. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ****P ≤ 0.0001.One of the hallmarks of endurance exercise in mammals is muscle mitochondrial adaptation, which can be reflected in morphological and functional mitochondrial improvements (27). We therefore explored the consequences of long-term swim exercise on the body wall muscle mitochondrial network, using a C. elegans strain in which mitochondria are labeled with GFP specifically in the body wall muscle (Pmyo-3mitoGFP). C. elegans, just like mammals, exhibit a well-described age-related decline in muscle mitochondrial morphology, characterized by increased disorganization and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network (12, 24, 28). We performed confocal imaging of Pmyo-3mitoGFP animals at different life stages to establish our own classification system for muscle mitochondrial network health that reflects a progressive increase in fragmentation and disorganization from class 1 (complete mitochondrial coverage of body wall muscle cells and tubular mitochondrial morphology) to class 5 (greatly reduced number of mitochondria and round morphology) (Fig. 2C). After the 3+3+2+2 exercise regimen, we took confocal images of the anterior body wall muscle of Pmyo-3mitoGFP animals on Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11, and scored the images blind to exercise condition using the freely available software Blinder (29). We found that exercised animals exhibited a significant improvement in muscle mitochondrial network organization at all 3 time points tested (Fig. 2D), even though Ad11 corresponds to a full 7 d after the last exercise session. Our results show that long-term swim exercise in C. elegans promotes long-lasting changes in the body wall muscle mitochondrial populations that are correlated with improvements in muscle performance and healthspan. Long-Term Exercise Improves Whole-Animal Mitochondrial Respiration Parameters. A central question in exercise physiology is the molecular nature of the factors that promote systemic health consequent to exercise. Given that the C. elegans model holds potential for genetic dissection of such health signaling circuits, we turned to focus on assessing animal-wide consequences of exercise for aging adults, with the expectation of defining endpoints that could be used for future mechanistic dissection. In light of the documented benefits of long-term swim exercise to muscle mitochondrial networks, we first sought to determine if mitochondrial function as measured at the whole-animal level was affected by our exercise regimens. To address this question, we analyzed numerous parameters of mitochondrial respiration in whole nematodes by measuring oxygen consumption rates with a Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer. In the Seahorse assays for measuring oxygen consumption rates, basal respiration is first monitored; dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) is then added to inhibit ATP synthase, which reveals relative ATP-linked respiration and distinguishes the residual proton leak; carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) then uncouples mitochondria, collapsing the proton gradient, such that the electron transport chain (ETC) is uninhibited and oxygen consumption by complex IV reaches the maximal rate (the difference between maximal respiration and basal respiration is the spare capacity); addition of sodium azide (a cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor) shuts down all mitochondrial respiration to reveal nonmitochondrial respiration (30) (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Long-term exercise improves mitochondrial respiration parameters and midlife survival. (A) Diagram of oxygen consumption rates measured in a Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer consequent to addition of mitochondrial inhibitors, allowing for the calculation of the 6 respiration parameters represented by different colors.

(H) Survival curve of WT animals exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. n = 221 to 245 animals. *P ≤ 0.05.We swim-exercised C. elegans with the 3+3+2+2 regimen and assayed oxygen consumption rates the following day (Ad5) and 4 d after training (Ad8). We observed no differences between control and exercised animals for basal respiration on both days (Fig. 3B). However, on Ad8, exercised animals exhibited an increase in maximal respiration (Fig. 3C), spare capacity (Fig. 3D), and ATP-linked respiration (Fig. 3E) as compared to nonexercised control counterparts, suggesting a healthier mitochondria population in exercised animals with an improved ability to meet energy requirements under potential challenges of high-energy demand situations. A mild mitochondrial uncoupling by a higher proton leak has been suggested to protect against excessive reactive oxygen species production and oxidative damage in active tissues and organisms (31). Therefore, the increase in proton leak of exercised animals on Ad5 (Fig. 3F) might be a protective mechanism against excessive oxidative stress during and shortly after the long-term exercise regimen, with the proton leak returning to control levels by Ad8. We observed a decrease in nonmitochondrial respiration of exercised animals on Ad8 relative to nonexercised animals (Fig. 3G). Nonmitochondrial oxygen-consuming processes are not well defined but higher nonmitochondrial respiration has been associated with metabolic stress, inflammation, and damaged mitochondria (32), suggesting an overall healthier mitochondrial metabolism in Ad8 exercised animals. Muscle gene-expression data after the 4+4+4+4 regimen (Fig. 1C) suggested that 4 swim sessions per day might constitute an excessive exercise training regimen for C. elegans. To get a better sense of exercise consequences, we evaluated the effects of the 4+4+4+4 regimen to mitochondrial respiration parameters (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Overall, we observed similar trends for the 4+4+4+4 regimen when compared to the 3+3+2+2 regimen, with significant increases in maximal respiration, spare capacity, and ATP-linked respiration of 4+4+4+4 exercised animals. Proton leak was significantly decreased in 4+4+4+4 exercised animals and we found no differences for nonmitochondrial respiration. Importantly, oxygen consumption rates as a whole were significantly lower for the 4+4+4+4 samples relative to the 3+3+2+2 samples (especially on Ad8), indicating that the 4+4+4+4 regimen is stressful for both control and exercised animals and is associated with an overall reduction in mitochondrial health. Taken together, our analyses support that the 3+3+2+2 swim exercise regimen in C. elegans induces both mitochondrial morphological changes (in muscle) and improvements in whole-animal mitochondrial health, with effects that can last for several days after exercise cessation. Midlife Survival Is Increased in Swim-Exercised C. elegans. The improvement in mitochondrial function we documented at the whole-animal level raised the question of whether swim exercise is able to improve additional organismal-wide health measures. In humans, exercise can be correlated with longevity (33–36), and thus we compared relative survival of 3+3+2+2 exercised and nonexercised populations as an indicator of overall health. Our survival assays revealed that a 3+3+2+2 swim exercise regimen does not change the maximum lifespan of C. elegans population (Fig. 3H). However, exercised animals showed on average ∼15% increase in survival between Ad12 and Ad20 compared to control animals (Fig. 3H; see SI Appendix, Fig. S5 for details of independent trials). This enhancement in midlife survival provides further evidence that long-term swim exercise in C. elegans induces systemic health benefits rather than isolated adaptations at the body wall muscle level. We also performed survival assays with the 4+4+4+4 regimen that confirmed this exercise regimen to be detrimental for overall C. elegans health given the significant decrease in survival of exercised animals when compared to control animals (average of ∼12% decrease in survival between Ad12 and Ad20) (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Pharyngeal and Intestinal Healthspans Are Extended after Long-Term Swim Exercise. Given swim exercise benefits evident at the whole-nematode level, we sought to detect tissue-specific improvements in C. elegans organs that are not an activity focus during exercise. The C. elegans pharynx is of particular interest as pharyngeal pumping function declines markedly with age (7) and the pharynx shares molecular and functional similarities with the vertebrate heart (37). Notably, however, C. elegans swim exercise markedly reduces pumping during swimming (SI Appendix, Fig. S7), so that training benefits are anticipated to be secondary effects of the swim. We quantified pharyngeal pumping rate of WT C. elegans after a 3+3+2+2 exercise regimen. We observed no difference in pumping rate at Ad5 and Ad8 but at Ad11 and Ad15, exercised animals showed a significant increase in pumping rate relative to controls (Fig. 4A). Notably, exercise health benefits to pharyngeal function become evident late in life, during the time-window of accentuated age-related decline. It is striking that even though animals are trained only on the first 4 d of adulthood, exercise-dependent effects are long lasting, and in this case maintained 11 d after the last exercise bout. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Pharyngeal and intestinal healthspans are extended after long-term swim exercise.

(B) Representative image of non-Smurf (first and third animals from left to right) and Smurf (second and fourth animals from left to right, arrows indicate leaks) animals. (C and D) Higher-magnification images of Smurf animals showing intestinal leakage in the anterior (C) and posterior (D) regions. Arrows in B–D indicate areas of blue dye leakage into the body cavity. (Scale bars, 50 µm.) (E) Percentage of Smurf animals at Ad8, Ad11, and Ad15 in WT nematodes exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. n = 4 to 8 independent trials. *P ≤ 0.05, ***P ≤ 0.001.The C. elegans intestine is an additional tissue of central health importance, as the intestine plays critical roles in digestion and metabolism and serves as a focal signaling center for stress response and aging regulation (38). The C. elegans intestine constitutes a strong barrier to gut content leak in young animals, but with age, intestinal barrier function breaks down. Breakdown of intestinal barrier function can be measured by feeding a nonabsorbable blue dye and checking for dye leakage outside the intestine, an assay referred to as the “Smurf assay” since animals turn blue like cartoon Smurfs (39). We assayed the maintenance of gut integrity in exercised vs. nonexercised controls using the Smurf assay to confirm that animals with intestinal epithelial integrity retained the blue dye within the intestinal tract, whereas animals with a compromised intestinal barrier leak the blue dye to their body cavity (Fig. 4 B–D). We found that the percentage of Smurf animals in both control and exercise samples was very low at Ad8 after a 3+3+2+2 regimen (Fig. 4E), consistent with prior studies that revealed the later life onset of this aspect of gut decline (39). Later in life (Ad11), we found that the proportion of Smurf animals was one-third lower in exercise versus control (Fig. 4E). Differences disappeared at Ad15 (Fig. 4E). We conclude that long-term swim exercise improves intestinal integrity and function, evident for a particular time-window later in C. elegans life. Learning Ability Is Enhanced in Exercised C. elegans. Benefits to nervous system function, including learning and memory enhancement, are documented outcomes of mammalian exercise (40, 41). We therefore tested whether long-term exercise might improve associative neuronal functions in adult C. elegans. C. elegans can positively associate food with a specific chemical odor (e.g., butanone) (11, 42). We tested a paradigm in which animals are starved for 1 h followed by food-butanone conditioning in seeded NGM plates with 10% butanone for 1 h (Fig. 5A). We performed chemotaxis assays by evaluating attraction toward butanone (normally a weak attractant) vs. isoamyl alcohol (a natural strong attractant) for naïve and conditioned animals. Naïve animals (i.e., nonconditioned) are attracted almost exclusively to isoamyl alcohol, whereas a significant proportion of food-butanone–conditioned animals choose butanone over isoamyl alcohol (Fig. 5A). The increase in chemotaxis toward butanone of conditioned animals relative to naïve animals corresponds to the learning index. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Learning ability is enhanced in exercised C. elegans. (A) Diagram of the associative learning assay. After the 3+3+2+2 regimen, we starved Ad5 animals for 1 h followed by food-butanone conditioning in a seeded NGM plate with 10% butanone solution on the inside of the lid. We performed chemotaxis assays of naïve and conditioned animals by testing attraction to butanone vs. isoamyl alcohol. (B) Learning index of Ad5 WT animals 0 h postconditioning after exposure to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. Chemotaxis index (CI) = (animal number at butanone − animal number at isoamyl alcohol)/(total animal number − immobile animal number at origin). We calculated learning index by subtraction of naïve CI from postconditioning CI. n = 8 independent trials. **P ≤ 0.01.Remarkably, we find that the 3+3+2+2 regimen increased the learning index of Ad5 exercised animals by an average of 35% as compared to nonexercised control counterparts (Fig. 5B). Despite the quantifiable increase in learning ability, short-term memory of exercised animals did not significantly improve; both control and exercised animals showed a 50% reduction in learning index 0.5-h postconditioning and just a residual learning index 1-h postconditioning (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). These results reveal that long-term swim exercise enhances neuronal learning ability in adult C. elegans and raise the question as to whether specific neuronal circuits or activities may be aided by particular exercise experiences. Long-Term Swim Exercise Improves Neuronal Health in Multiple C. elegans Neurodegeneration Models. An additional measure of neuronal health is the capacity to respond to stress induced by neurotoxic proteins. We therefore sought to determine whether exercise could counter pathological conditions in C. elegans models of human neurodegenerative disease. We started by analyzing a C. elegans strain that expresses the human aggregating F3ΔK280 Tau fragment together with the full-length (FL) mutant Tau V337M in all neurons (Prab-3F3ΔK280; Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M) (43). This tauopathy model is based on mutations commonly identified in patients with frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (44). Transgenic strains exhibit robust toxicity phenotypes, including strongly impaired motility, reflected in a reduced mean velocity compared to antiaggregating strains (43). The 3+3+2+2 swim regimen led to a clear increase in mean velocity in exercised aggregating Tau animals, as assayed at Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11, relative to nonexercised control counterparts (Fig. 6A). We conclude that swim exercise can protect against the deleterious consequences of aggregating Tau. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Long-term swim exercise improves neuronal health in multiple C. elegans neurodegeneration models. (A) Mean velocity of Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11 animals expressing aggregating Tau in all neurons (Prab-3F3ΔK280; Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M) exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. Note that Tau-expressing animals did not exhibit a standard swimming motion due to impaired motility but were more active in liquid than on agar so enhanced activity during the assay was confirmed. Each point represents a single animal. n = 54 to 60 animals. (B) Representative confocal images of Ad3 animals expressing aggregating Tau in all neurons and GFP in GABAergic motor neurons (Prab-3F3ΔK280; Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M; Punc-25GFP). Arrows indicate gaps in the ventral cords. (Scale bar, 30 µm.) (C) Average number of gaps detectable in ventral and dorsal cords of Ad3 animals expressing aggregating Tau in all neurons and GFP in GABAergic motor neurons exposed to the 3+2 regimen. n = 5 independent trials. Note that this strain did not exhibit a standard swimming motion due to the severe uncoordinated phenotype, which may explain the lack of up-regulation of muscle structural genes after the 3+2 regimen (SI Appendix, Fig. S9A). Nevertheless, animals were still more active in liquid than on agar so enhanced activity was confirmed. (D) CI toward benzaldehyde of Ad3 animals expressing neuronal Aβ1–42 [smg-1(cc546ts) Psnb-1Aβ1–42::long 3′-UTR] exposed to the 3+3 regimen. We raised animals at 23 °C from the egg stage onward. CI = (animal number at benzaldehyde half − animal number at ethanol half)/(total animal number − immobile animal number at origin). n = 5 independent trials. Note that this strain swam slower than WT, which may explain the lack of significant up-regulation of muscle structural genes after the 3+3 regimen (SI Appendix, Fig. S9B). (E) Anterior touch sensitivity of Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11 animals expressing polyQ128 in the touch receptor neurons (Pmec-3htt57Q128) exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. n = 119 to 248 animals. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001.A second consequence of aggregating Tau expression in the C. elegans nervous system are severe morphological abnormalities in nerve cords, such that gaps in the ventral and dorsal cords can be observed during developmental and adult stages when GFP reporters are used for their visualization (43). We used a C. elegans strain in which the GABAergic motor neurons are GFP-labeled in the aggregating Tau background (Prab-3F3ΔK280; Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M; Punc-25GFP) (43) to quantify the number of gaps in GABAergic motor neurons in exercised vs. nonexercised control animals (Fig. 6B). We found that this strain exhibited severely uncoordinated locomotion and an overall unhealthy appearance; therefore, we elected to reduce the swim regimen to the first 2 d of adulthood and 5 swim sessions (3+2 regimen) to prevent overtraining, with analysis of cord morphology 1 d later. We find that swim-exercised Ad3 mutants exhibited a subtle but consistent decrease in the average number of gaps in GABAergic motor neurons relative to nonexercised controls (Fig. 6C). Taken together, our analysis of a tauopathy model demonstrates that swim exercise is able to improve pathological effects of neuronal aggregating Tau, both at the functional and morphological levels. We also addressed impact of exercise on a C. elegans AD model in which human amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide (1–42) is pan-neuronally expressed in a temperature-sensitive manner [smg-1(cc546ts) Psnb-1Aβ1–42::long 3′-UTR] (45). One of the phenotypes previously described in this strain is a reduced chemotactic ability toward benzaldehyde (45). When raised at 23 °C (a temperature that induces expression of Aβ1–42), chemotaxis performance of transgenic Aβ animals decreases rapidly during the first days of adulthood. We decided to limit the swim regimen for this strain to the first 2 d of adulthood (3+3 regimen) with assay at Ad3 because of the severity of chemotactic deficits exhibited at later time points (i.e., from Ad4 onward, animals exhibited virtually no chemotactic ability). We found that exercised Ad3 Aβ1–42-expressing animals exhibited a significantly higher chemotaxis index toward benzaldehyde than nonexercised control counterparts (Fig. 6D). Thus, swim exercise improves a neuronally controlled behavior in a C. elegans model of AD-associated toxicity. Finally, we tested exercise effects in a C. elegans HD model in which the first 57 amino acids of human Huntingtin protein (HTT) are fused to an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ128), and this transgene is expressed in 10 neurons including the 6 touch receptor neurons (Pmec-3htt57Q128) (46). The C. elegans touch receptor neurons mediate the response to gentle touch (47) and polyQ expression in these specific neurons greatly accelerates touch deficits during adult life (46, 48). After a 3+3+2+2 swim regimen, we performed touch sensitivity assays by quantifying the animal responsiveness to 5 gentle touches on the head or the tail at different days of adulthood blinded to previous exercise experience of the animals. We found that exercised polyQ animals exhibited a significant improvement in touch sensitivity at Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11 for the anterior region (Fig. 6E), and at Ad5 and Ad8 for the posterior region (SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Thus, long-term swim exercise in C. elegans improves neuronal healthspan in a sensitized polyQ-mediated toxicity model. Overall, our testing of exercise impact on models in which human disease proteins impair C. elegans adult neuron functions demonstrates that long-term swim exercise improves neuronal healthspan at both morphological and functional levels, for different neuronal cell types in multiple neurodegeneration models. A particularly striking corollary is that sustained early adult swim training can confer a demonstrable health benefit even long after training has ended. Swim Exercise of Postreproductive C. elegans Also Improves Locomotory Vigor. One of the remarkable features of exercise in humans is the fact that exercise has been shown to be beneficial at all ages, including older adults even if they had never exercised before (49, 50). We therefore sought to determine whether C. elegans exercise performed at a later stage of adult life could also promote health benefits. We designed an exercise regimen for postreproductive C. elegans based on 2 daily swim sessions over a period of 3 d (2+2+2 regimen) that we executed from Ad6 to Ad8 (Fig. 7A). To address potential overtraining of these older animals, we tested a shorter duration for each swim session (i.e., 60 min) in parallel with the usual 90-min swims. We found that the 2+2+2 regimen with 90-min swims promoted an increase in crawling maximum velocity of postreproductive exercised C. elegans on Ad9 but that improvement in locomotion disappeared by Ad12 (Fig. 7B). Postreproductive exercised animals that performed the 2+2+2 regimen with 60-min swims exhibited a significant improvement in crawling maximum velocity on both Ad9 and Ad12 (Fig. 7C). These results show that postreproductive C. elegans can improve locomotory vigor upon swim exercise and that modified regimen in older animals can promote effective and long-lasting exercise benefits, akin to what we described above for young adult exercise.

    "discussion": "Discussion The development of short-lived genetic models in which fundamental questions of exercise biology can be evaluated throughout the entire aging process holds great potential for advancing our knowledge on transtissue exercise signaling that improves old-age health. Here we define a long-term adult exercise regimen that induces robust exercise adaptations in multiple C. elegans tissues. We show that repeated daily swim sessions are essential for molecular, morphological, and functional adaptations at the body wall muscle level. Moreover, whole-animal health parameters, including mitochondrial respiration and midlife survival, as well as functionality of tissues that are not directly involved in physical activity, such as pharynx and intestine, are improved by regular exercise. Exercise benefits to learning ability and to mitigating symptoms of neuronal pathologies in tauopathy, AD, and HD C. elegans models can accompany regular swimming in young adulthood. Particularly noteworthy is that we find benefits of exercise regimens in young adult life that can be documented to extend late into life after the regular exercise period ends, a finding that suggests a potential switch mechanism for healthy aging trajectories might be triggered by even limited early enhanced activity. How C. elegans Trains for Sustained Adult Health. We found that multiple swim sessions per day, occurring over several days, are essential for exercise-dependent molecular and functional adaptations in C. elegans. Using muscle gene expression and locomotion performance as readouts, we identified the 3+3+2+2 regimen as the most consistent protocol that induces long-term exercise adaptations. Although we expect that particular health and fitness readouts might require a slightly adjusted multiple daily swim regimen to induce optimal exercise adaptation for a given parameter, the 3+3+2+2 protocol does confer a broad swath of health improvements. Our data establishing the need for repeated exercise as required for health adaptations may partially explain the lack of mitochondrial adaptations and survival improvement previously reported for a vibration C. elegans exercise model (17) and the lack of locomotion improvement in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy C. elegans model swim-exercised 90 min per day (18), as these studies did not include exercise training in consecutive days or multiple times per day. The transient increase in physical activity during an exercise bout and the following postexercise recovery period are crucial for long-lasting exercise adaptation in mammals (27, 51). We introduced a 4.5-h minimum interval between swim sessions in our exercise regimens based on our previous documentation that most acute exercise changes return to baseline levels by 4-h postexercise (13). As rest and recovery appears to be important to instituting positive outcomes of exercise, we suggest that recently described regimens in C. elegans based on continuous burrowing or swimming over several days (18) may need to incorporate activity breaks to accomplish long-term benefits. We also note that our data indicate that the exercise regimen should be reduced to prevent overtraining and consequent deleterious effects when working with strains with severe health deficits or older age animals. For example, a 4+4+4+4 regimen led to a decrease in overall health due to overtraining, which was particularly evident from the reduction in midlife survival of 4+4+4+4 exercised animals. For nematodes and humans, then, recovery and moderation are factors in exercise health outcomes. Systemic Benefits of Exercise. Longevity. A majority of human exercise studies support that exercise can reduce mortality risk and increase longevity of healthy subjects, patients, and elite athletes, although some studies suggest a negative or neutral association between exercise and lifespan in humans (33–36). A fair generalization may be that the extent of the exercise benefits is variable and dependent in part on the type of exercise, the population studied, and the particular outcomes recorded. Similar to observations in humans, the effect of exercise on C. elegans longevity seems to be highly dependent on the adopted exercise regimen with reported outcomes in previous studies varying from detrimental to beneficial (14–18). Our 3+3+2+2 swim exercise regimen promoted a consistent increase in midlife population survival rather than an increase in maximum lifespan. Thus, exercised populations are able to survive extra days during the time-window when the mortality rate is at its peak. It is important to note that in our studies, this time-window occurs 8 to 16 d after the last exercise session, raising the possibility that extension of the swim regimen beyond the first 4 d of adulthood may further potentiate survival differences and underscoring that early adult activity can have long lasting impact on healthy aging.Nonexercising cardiac-like muscle. One of the pressing questions in exercise biology is how physical activity can promote health benefits in multiple tissues of the body, especially in those tissues not directly engaged by neuromuscular activity. We found that long-term swim exercise in C. elegans increases pharyngeal pumping rate during midlife, reflecting a delay in the age-associated decline of cardiac-like muscle function (37). In the case of C. elegans, the pumping mechanism is inhibited rather than accelerated during swim training, so the pharyngeal muscle itself does not “train,” yet pharyngeal functional health nonetheless improves with exercise. Our observations raise the possibility that some exercise benefits to human heart might be conferred via transtissue signals rather than exercise-enhanced heart contraction.Intestinal integrity. We also observed a significant improvement of the older age intestinal barrier function in exercised C. elegans, establishing that enhanced gut health is a systemic effect of exercise experience. In humans, exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (52), although high-intensity, prolonged exercise sessions will cause an acute increase in intestinal permeability (or “leaky gut”) (53), which has been associated with infectious diseases, obesity, and autoimmune diseases (54). We suggest that an exercise-dependent hormetic effect on intestinal function can reconcile these apparently contradictory findings: Acute exercise bouts may enhance intestinal permeability, but regular exercise training will promote intestinal adaptation over time that might enhance intestinal barrier function, similar to what we detected in C. elegans.Age-associated neuronal decline and neurodegeneration stresses. Our study presents clear evidence that exercise in C. elegans promotes neuronal health at multiple levels. Kauffman et al. (11) have shown that the learning process is molecularly distinct from memory formation; and that capacity for learning declines with age. We show that learning ability is markedly increased in swim-exercised WT animals, whereas short-term memory retention is not significantly improved by the exercise regimen we implement here. Interestingly, other longevity paradigms have been reported to have focused impact on particular components of the learning/memory process (11): Dietary-restricted eat-2 mutants retain the ability to learn for longer and maintain short- and long-term memory with age, but daf-2 reduced insulin signaling mutants retain the ability to learn for longer but lose long-term memory at the same rate as WT (11). Overall, the fact that swim exercise enhances adult learning capacity reveals that particular neuronal capabilities can be improved as a result of animal activity and adds maintained neuronal function to the list of healthspan benefits of exercise in C. elegans. Numerous studies in animal models and humans show that exercise can improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of developing dementia later in life (40, 41). However, the effect of exercise on dementia patients is not clear, with outcomes of published studies ranging from detrimental to beneficial exercise outcomes (55–58). Taking advantage of neurodegeneration models of human disease in C. elegans, we show that swim exercise improves neuronal healthspan in disease protein-stressed neurons, at both morphological and functional levels, for different neuronal cell types. We detected exercise-dependent health benefits for motor neurons, chemosensory neurons, and touch receptor neurons in tauopathy, AD, and HD conditions, respectively, revealing a broad impact of exercise in maintaining health in the C. elegans nervous system confronted with disease stresses. Exercise prescription by primary care physicians is currently recommended as a way to improve patients’ general health and reduce all-cause mortality (59). Our data strengthen the case that exercise can have powerful beneficial effects on neurodegenerative disease conditions. Overall, the documentation of transtissue impact of exercise makes it clear that C. elegans can be used as a model for the detailed mechanistic dissection of the molecular and tissue circuits that maintain animal vigor as a consequence of exercise. Exercise during Early Adult Life Can Have Clear Long-Term Impact on Later Adult Health. We show in this study that long-term swim exercise in C. elegans induces health benefits at the body wall muscle, pharyngeal, intestinal, and neuronal levels. Remarkably, most of the exercise-dependent benefits are long lasting, with effects still detectable up to 7 to 16 d after the last exercise session for specific assays. Moreover, even exercise in postreproductive C. elegans can promote long-lasting locomotory improvements. Interestingly, a recent study shows that human volunteers who enrolled in an 8-mo exercise regimen still exhibit improvements in aerobic capacity and metabolic health 10 y after completion of exercise training (60). Thus, persistent health benefits of previous exercise training may be conserved from nematodes to humans. If so, the establishment of C. elegans as an exercise model opens the exciting possibility of uncovering the molecular signals responsible for life-long, exercise-dependent systemic health benefits.",

Copyright notice ID: 6876156 PMID: 31685639 Significance Exercise is a powerful antiaging intervention that protects against cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, sarcopenia, and cancer. How exercise promotes health benefits to multiple tissues in the body, however, remains poorly understood. We establish a young adult swim exercise regimen for the short-lived nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that induces health benefits at the neuromuscular, intestinal, and cognitive levels and protects against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Importantly, we found that swim exercise performed exclusively in early adulthood promotes long-lasting systemic benefits that are still detectable in midlife. The advantages of C. elegans as a short-lived genetic model will allow for dissection of the molecular circuitry involved in system-wide exercise benefits. Keywords: exercise, Caenorhabditis elegans, muscle, aging, neurodegenerationAbstract Regular physical exercise is the most efficient and accessible intervention known to promote healthy aging in humans. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate system-wide exercise benefits, however, remain poorly understood, especially as applies to tissues that do not participate directly in training activity. The establishment of exercise protocols for short-lived genetic models will be critical for deciphering fundamental mechanisms of transtissue exercise benefits to healthy aging. Here we document optimization of a long-term swim exercise protocol for Caenorhabditis elegans and we demonstrate its benefits to diverse aging tissues, even if exercise occurs only during a restricted phase of adulthood. We found that multiple daily swim sessions are essential for exercise adaptation, leading to body wall muscle improvements in structural gene expression, locomotory performance, and mitochondrial morphology. Swim exercise training enhances whole-animal health parameters, such as mitochondrial respiration and midlife survival, increases functional healthspan of the pharynx and intestine, and enhances nervous system health by increasing learning ability and protecting against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Remarkably, swim training only during early adulthood induces long-lasting systemic benefits that in several cases are still detectable well into midlife. Our data reveal the broad impact of swim exercise in promoting extended healthspan of multiple C. elegans tissues, underscore the potency of early exercise experience to influence long-term health, and establish the foundation for exploiting the powerful advantages of this genetic model for the dissection of the exercise-dependent molecular circuitry that confers system-wide health benefits to aging adults. Physical inactivity is a worldwide public health problem. Globally, more than 5 million premature deaths each year (∼9%) may be attributable to insufficient physical activity (1). Conversely, it is striking that exercise provides widespread health benefits, including protection against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and against age-associated declines in muscle, immune, and cognitive function (2, 3). Given the overwhelming projected social and economic costs of caring for the growing inactive and elderly populations, defining how activity and exercise physiology promote healthier aging is of critical importance. Unfortunately, however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate systemic exercise benefits remain poorly understood. This gap in knowledge is partially due to the lack of established short-lived genetic models in which fundamental questions on transtissue exercise signaling can be evaluated over the entire aging process. Importantly, exercise training in Drosophila improves motility, cardiac performance, and mitochondrial health (4–6), supporting that exercise adaptation is conserved from invertebrates to humans, and opening the door to the exploitation of powerful invertebrate model systems for mechanistic dissection of health benefit circuits in exercise biology. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetic model widely used in aging and stress research that holds great potential to unlock the molecular circuitry involved in exercise-dependent systemic health benefits. The short lifespan (about 3 wk) makes C. elegans a desirable model with which to assess exercise effects over the entire adult lifetime. C. elegans reach adulthood in ∼2.5 d and self-reproduce for approximately the first 6 d of adult life (7). The reduction in reproductive capacity is accompanied by age-related decline in multiple tissues and functions over the next several days, including locomotion, muscle structure, pharyngeal pumping, intestinal integrity, and neuronally controlled actions (7–11). The aging C. elegans body wall muscle exhibits nuclear fragmentation, mitochondrial network and sarcomere disorganization, lipid accumulation, and loss of muscle mass (8, 12), resembling the fundamental characteristics of human sarcopenia (the pervasive age-associated loss of muscle strength and muscle mass that contributes to human frailty). We have shown previously that swimming in a liquid environment is more energetically demanding for C. elegans than the crawling motion on agar plates used in standard laboratory growth protocols (13). Moreover, we showed that a single 90-min C. elegans swim session induces key features of mammalian exercise, namely locomotory fatigue, muscle mitochondrial oxidation, a transcriptional oxidative stress response, and changes in carbohydrate and fat metabolism (13). Hartman et al. (14) found that a 6-d swim exercise regimen in C. elegans improves body wall muscle mitochondrial morphology, changes mitochondrial respiration parameters, and protects against acute exposure to the mito-toxicants rotenone and arsenic. Other exercise paradigms in C. elegans have been described (15–18), with a focus on body wall muscle- and mitochondrial-related phenotypes. However, exercise-dependent effects on a wider range of C. elegans tissues (i.e., systemic benefits of exercise to nonmuscle tissue and their potential extension into older adult health) remain mostly undescribed. Here, we report on the optimization of a long-term swim exercise protocol for C. elegans and establish that multiple daily swim sessions are essential for exercise adaptation that includes increased muscle gene expression, improved locomotory performance, and enhanced maintenance of the muscle mitochondrial network. Whole-animal parameters, such as mitochondrial respiration and midlife survival, are also improved by exercise. Importantly, we show that swim exercise improves pharyngeal, intestinal, and neuronal functions. Furthermore, we find that neurodegenerative pathological conditions in C. elegans models of tauopathy, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Huntington’s disease (HD) are ameliorated by swim exercise training. The systemic exercise effects we describe reveal a broad impact of swim training on C. elegans physiology and establish the critical groundwork for future dissection of the molecular circuitry responsible for exercise-dependent transtissue health benefits. Results Multiple Daily Swim Sessions Are Essential for C. elegans Exercise Adaptation. Although a single 90-min swim session in C. elegans induces key features of mammalian exercise (13), most exercise-dependent health benefits in humans arise from long-term training regimens that lead to exercise adaptation over time (19); thus, we sought to develop and validate a long-term C. elegans exercise protocol. We planned to determine an efficacious long-term exercise regimen in C. elegans by characterizing the impact of different numbers of 90-min swim sessions in M9 buffer executed over the first 4 d of adult life (Fig. 1A), a period that corresponds to the peak locomotory performance phase and constitutes a timeframe over which C. elegans are able to complete 90-min swims without any significant inactive periods (9, 10, 20). We tested long-term exercise regimens with swim frequencies of 1 session per day (1+1+1+1), 2 sessions per day (2+2+2+2), 3 sessions per day on the first 2 d of adulthood plus 2 sessions per day on the third and fourth adult days (3+3+2+2), 3 sessions per day (3+3+3+3), and 4 sessions per day (4+4+4+4) (Fig. 1B). The exercise adaptation readouts we quantitated included both a molecular assay (gene-expression analysis by qPCR) and a functional assay (locomotion analysis by recording movement and calculating crawling maximum velocity). Importantly, given that our interest is in defining regimens that lead to medium- to long-term physiological changes (i.e., exercise adaptation and system-wide health benefits), we assayed molecular and functional readouts 1 to several days postexercise, rather than immediately after the last swim session. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Multiple daily swim sessions are essential for C. elegans exercise adaptation. (A) Diagram of the 90-min swim session protocol performed for each exercise bout. We transferred control animals to an unseeded NGM plate for 90 min, whereas exercise animals were transferred to an unseeded NGM plate flooded with M9 buffer for the same 90 min to swim. (B) Diagram indicating the time of the day of each exercise session for the 5 long-term exercise regimens tested.

In mammals, long-term endurance exercise leads to profound transcriptional changes at the muscle level, with up-regulation of muscle structural genes, such as troponins, tropomyosins, myosin light chains, and myosin heavy chains, as one of the reproducible changes (21–23). Therefore, we first wanted to determine if long-term swim exercise regimens could also promote the up-regulation of muscle structural gene expression in C. elegans. We selected 10 C. elegans genes that included the major structural gene classes found to be up-regulated in mammals in an exercise-dependent manner (SI Appendix, Table S1) (24). Importantly, all of the genes we included in our analysis have been documented to be massively down-regulated with age in C. elegans (24), which underscores their potential importance in age-associated sarcopenia and locomotory decline. We performed qPCR for the test swim regimens 1 d after the training was completed, which corresponds to adult day 5 (Ad5) (Fig. 1C). We found that the 1+1+1+1 regimen led to an overall tendency of down-regulation across the muscle structural gene test set, supporting that single daily swim sessions are insufficient to induce exercise adaptations (at least at the molecular level). In contrast, 2+2+2+2, 3+3+2+2, and 3+3+3+3 regimens led to an overall up-regulation of muscle structural gene expression. The 3+3+2+2 regimen induced the most consistent transcriptional up-regulation profile with 6 of the 10 test genes (tnt-2, unc-27, mlc-1, unc-54, zig-12, and unc-87) exhibiting a statistically significant difference when compared to the control animals. We noted up-regulation of 4 of the 10 genes after just 2 d of training (3+3 regimen) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A); muscle structural gene expression of 3+3+2+2 exercised animals returned to approximately control levels by Ad8 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). The 4+4+4+4 regimen induced a wider range of transcriptional outcomes (2 genes showing a significant up-regulation [tnt-2 and unc-27] and 2 genes showing a significant down-regulation [unc-15 and myo-3]) and reflected a trend toward down-regulation that suggested excessive exercise can be deleterious to maintained muscle expression (Fig. 1C). Overall, our data establish that a training plan of 3+3+2+2 can induce increased transcription of a battery of C. elegans muscle structural genes, paralleling a feature of mammalian exercise adaptation. To assess training impact on muscle performance, we also measured a functional readout of our long-term C. elegans exercise regimens. We focused on the C. elegans crawling maximum velocity since this parameter has been documented to accurately report movement ability, correlates well with healthspan, and can even be a longevity predictor at certain ages (10). We measured maximum velocity by placing Ad5 and Ad8 single animals on agar plates and determining the maximum speed at which they move over a 30-s time interval. Note that our swim-exercised animals were not specifically trained for enhancement of crawling maximum velocity, so maximum velocity serves as an indicator of overall vigor that results from swim training. The 1+1+1+1 regimen failed to significantly increase maximum velocity of exercised animals compared to controls on both days (Fig. 1D), independently supporting our conclusion from transcriptional studies that single daily swim sessions are not sufficient to induce long-term exercise adaptations. In contrast, we found that all of the multiple daily swim regimens promoted a significant increase in maximum velocity, on the order of a 10 to 20% increase over nonexercised animals assayed at Ad5 (Fig. 1D). We found a trend toward increased maximum velocity on Ad8 (4 d after cessation of training) for all 4 multiple daily swim regimens, but only the 3+3+2+2 regimen led to a statistically significant 24% increase (Fig. 1D; see SI Appendix, Fig. S1C for all maximum velocity values). Our findings reveal a remarkable long-term benefit of sustained early adult life exercise training. Overall, the molecular and functional readouts we tested establish that multiple daily swim sessions are required in WT C. elegans for robust exercise adaptation at molecular and functional levels, with the 3+3+2+2 regimen inducing improvements in multiple assays that could feature long-term functional maintenance.Molecular and Functional Changes Are Dependent on Increased Locomotor Activity Rather than Exposure to a Liquid Environment. We showed previously that a single swim session induces specific exercise-dependent acute responses and does not activate a generalized stress response due to liquid exposure (13). Nevertheless, it remained possible that continuous reexposure of C. elegans to the M9 buffer liquid environment during the long-term exercise regimens might induce some physiological benefits. To definitively rule out simple liquid exposure as an important factor for the molecular and functional changes we documented above, we constructed microfluidic devices in which C. elegans can be exposed to M9 buffer but for which we could manipulate the locomotion type (crawling vs. swimming) by modulating the chamber height (25). To test whether exposure to the M9 buffer swim media might suffice to induce exercise adaptations, we performed the 3+3+2+2 regimen by transferring C. elegans from seeded nematode growth medium (NGM) plates to M9 buffer-filled microfluidic devices that had a large chamber height (swim exercise possible) (Movie S1) or a small chamber height (control, animals are sedate and crawl rather than swim) (Movie S2) for 90 min. After each 90-min session, we recovered animals from the microfluidic chambers and returned them to seeded NGM plates. We conducted qPCR analysis at Ad5 to find that microfluidics-exercised C. elegans up-regulate muscle structural genes (statistically significant for tnt-2, mlc-1, unc-54, and zig-12) as compared to microfluidics-constrained control animals (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A), similar to the outcomes of the 3+3+2+2 regimen performed on NGM plates (Fig. 1C). We also determined that muscle structural gene expression was not up-regulated in microfluidics-control animals relative to plate-control animals (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B), confirming that liquid exposure is not sufficient for muscle transcriptional induction. Importantly, we found that the microfluidics-exercised animals exhibited a significant increase in maximum velocity on Ad8 relative to microfluidics nonexercised animals, similar to the 3+3+2+2 regimen implemented by flooding plates with M9 buffer (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). Our data establish that transcriptional and functional changes induced in M9 buffer require swim activity rather than being the consequence of liquid exposure, and independently confirm that long-term swim regimens induce exercise adaptations.Long-Term Swim Exercise Improves Performance and Healthspan of C. elegans Body Wall Muscle. The C. elegans body wall muscle is the tissue most directly involved in long-term exercise training and thus we sought to characterize additional aspects of body wall muscle performance and health consequent to exercise. We recently developed a burrowing assay, in which nematodes are stimulated to move through a Pluronic F-127 gel (a hydrogel that transitions from liquid to gel at safe temperatures for C. elegans survival) toward a chemoattractant (26). We loaded liquid-phase Pluronic F-127 on top of C. elegans in 12-well plates, and allowed the Pluronic F-127 to quickly gel at room temperature, trapping animals under the gel. We then added Escherichia coli OP50-1 on top of the gel, which serves as a food attractant (assay diagram in Fig. 2A). In this 3D gel environment, animals with a better neuromuscular performance reach the surface faster and in higher numbers (26). After a 3+3+2+2 training regimen, Ad5 exercised nematodes reached the gel surface at a significantly higher proportion during the 3-h burrowing assay window as compared to their nonexercised control counterparts (Fig. 2B). Exercised animals have similar chemotactic ability toward E. coli OP50-1 relative to control animals in standard 2D chemotaxis assays on agar plates, supporting similar attraction to OP50-1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). The burrowing data constitute an additional line of evidence that long-term swim exercise improves the functional general output of C. elegans body wall muscle. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Long-term swim exercise improves burrowing performance and mitochondrial profiles of body wall muscle. (A) Diagram of burrowing assay. After the 3+3+2+2 regimen, we trapped Ad5 animals under a Pluronic F-127 gel and added attractant food E. coli OP50-1 to the center of the gel surface. Animals are attracted by the food and burrow to the surface of the gel at different rates.

(D) Distribution of mitochondrial classes in body wall muscle of Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11 Pmyo-3mitoGFP animals exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. n = 160 to 170 muscle images. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ****P ≤ 0.0001.One of the hallmarks of endurance exercise in mammals is muscle mitochondrial adaptation, which can be reflected in morphological and functional mitochondrial improvements (27). We therefore explored the consequences of long-term swim exercise on the body wall muscle mitochondrial network, using a C. elegans strain in which mitochondria are labeled with GFP specifically in the body wall muscle (Pmyo-3mitoGFP). C. elegans, just like mammals, exhibit a well-described age-related decline in muscle mitochondrial morphology, characterized by increased disorganization and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network (12, 24, 28). We performed confocal imaging of Pmyo-3mitoGFP animals at different life stages to establish our own classification system for muscle mitochondrial network health that reflects a progressive increase in fragmentation and disorganization from class 1 (complete mitochondrial coverage of body wall muscle cells and tubular mitochondrial morphology) to class 5 (greatly reduced number of mitochondria and round morphology) (Fig. 2C). After the 3+3+2+2 exercise regimen, we took confocal images of the anterior body wall muscle of Pmyo-3mitoGFP animals on Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11, and scored the images blind to exercise condition using the freely available software Blinder (29). We found that exercised animals exhibited a significant improvement in muscle mitochondrial network organization at all 3 time points tested (Fig. 2D), even though Ad11 corresponds to a full 7 d after the last exercise session. Our results show that long-term swim exercise in C. elegans promotes long-lasting changes in the body wall muscle mitochondrial populations that are correlated with improvements in muscle performance and healthspan.Long-Term Exercise Improves Whole-Animal Mitochondrial Respiration Parameters. A central question in exercise physiology is the molecular nature of the factors that promote systemic health consequent to exercise. Given that the C. elegans model holds potential for genetic dissection of such health signaling circuits, we turned to focus on assessing animal-wide consequences of exercise for aging adults, with the expectation of defining endpoints that could be used for future mechanistic dissection. In light of the documented benefits of long-term swim exercise to muscle mitochondrial networks, we first sought to determine if mitochondrial function as measured at the whole-animal level was affected by our exercise regimens. To address this question, we analyzed numerous parameters of mitochondrial respiration in whole nematodes by measuring oxygen consumption rates with a Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer. In the Seahorse assays for measuring oxygen consumption rates, basal respiration is first monitored; dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) is then added to inhibit ATP synthase, which reveals relative ATP-linked respiration and distinguishes the residual proton leak; carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) then uncouples mitochondria, collapsing the proton gradient, such that the electron transport chain (ETC) is uninhibited and oxygen consumption by complex IV reaches the maximal rate (the difference between maximal respiration and basal respiration is the spare capacity); addition of sodium azide (a cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor) shuts down all mitochondrial respiration to reveal nonmitochondrial respiration (30) (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Long-term exercise improves mitochondrial respiration parameters and midlife survival. (A) Diagram of oxygen consumption rates measured in a Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer consequent to addition of mitochondrial inhibitors, allowing for the calculation of the 6 respiration parameters represented by different colors. (B–G) Basal respiration (B), maximal respiration (C), spare capacity (D), ATP-linked respiration (E), proton leak (F), and nonmitochondrial respiration (G) values of Ad5 and Ad8 WT animals exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. n = 13 to 30 Seahorse XF24 Microplate wells. (H) Survival curve of WT animals exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. n = 221 to 245 animals. *P ≤ 0.05.We swim-exercised C. elegans with the 3+3+2+2 regimen and assayed oxygen consumption rates the following day (Ad5) and 4 d after training (Ad8). We observed no differences between control and exercised animals for basal respiration on both days (Fig. 3B). However, on Ad8, exercised animals exhibited an increase in maximal respiration (Fig. 3C), spare capacity (Fig. 3D), and ATP-linked respiration (Fig. 3E) as compared to nonexercised control counterparts, suggesting a healthier mitochondria population in exercised animals with an improved ability to meet energy requirements under potential challenges of high-energy demand situations. A mild mitochondrial uncoupling by a higher proton leak has been suggested to protect against excessive reactive oxygen species production and oxidative damage in active tissues and organisms (31). Therefore, the increase in proton leak of exercised animals on Ad5 (Fig. 3F) might be a protective mechanism against excessive oxidative stress during and shortly after the long-term exercise regimen, with the proton leak returning to control levels by Ad8. We observed a decrease in nonmitochondrial respiration of exercised animals on Ad8 relative to nonexercised animals (Fig. 3G). Nonmitochondrial oxygen-consuming processes are not well defined but higher nonmitochondrial respiration has been associated with metabolic stress, inflammation, and damaged mitochondria (32), suggesting an overall healthier mitochondrial metabolism in Ad8 exercised animals. Muscle gene-expression data after the 4+4+4+4 regimen (Fig. 1C) suggested that 4 swim sessions per day might constitute an excessive exercise training regimen for C. elegans. To get a better sense of exercise consequences, we evaluated the effects of the 4+4+4+4 regimen to mitochondrial respiration parameters (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Overall, we observed similar trends for the 4+4+4+4 regimen when compared to the 3+3+2+2 regimen, with significant increases in maximal respiration, spare capacity, and ATP-linked respiration of 4+4+4+4 exercised animals. Proton leak was significantly decreased in 4+4+4+4 exercised animals and we found no differences for nonmitochondrial respiration. Importantly, oxygen consumption rates as a whole were significantly lower for the 4+4+4+4 samples relative to the 3+3+2+2 samples (especially on Ad8), indicating that the 4+4+4+4 regimen is stressful for both control and exercised animals and is associated with an overall reduction in mitochondrial health. Taken together, our analyses support that the 3+3+2+2 swim exercise regimen in C. elegans induces both mitochondrial morphological changes (in muscle) and improvements in whole-animal mitochondrial health, with effects that can last for several days after exercise cessation.Midlife Survival Is Increased in Swim-Exercised C. elegans. The improvement in mitochondrial function we documented at the whole-animal level raised the question of whether swim exercise is able to improve additional organismal-wide health measures. In humans, exercise can be correlated with longevity (33–36), and thus we compared relative survival of 3+3+2+2 exercised and nonexercised populations as an indicator of overall health. Our survival assays revealed that a 3+3+2+2 swim exercise regimen does not change the maximum lifespan of C. elegans population (Fig. 3H). However, exercised animals showed on average ∼15% increase in survival between Ad12 and Ad20 compared to control animals (Fig. 3H; see SI Appendix, Fig. S5 for details of independent trials). This enhancement in midlife survival provides further evidence that long-term swim exercise in C. elegans induces systemic health benefits rather than isolated adaptations at the body wall muscle level. We also performed survival assays with the 4+4+4+4 regimen that confirmed this exercise regimen to be detrimental for overall C. elegans health given the significant decrease in survival of exercised animals when compared to control animals (average of ∼12% decrease in survival between Ad12 and Ad20) (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).Pharyngeal and Intestinal Healthspans Are Extended after Long-Term Swim Exercise. Given swim exercise benefits evident at the whole-nematode level, we sought to detect tissue-specific improvements in C. elegans organs that are not an activity focus during exercise. The C. elegans pharynx is of particular interest as pharyngeal pumping function declines markedly with age (7) and the pharynx shares molecular and functional similarities with the vertebrate heart (37). Notably, however, C. elegans swim exercise markedly reduces pumping during swimming (SI Appendix, Fig. S7), so that training benefits are anticipated to be secondary effects of the swim. We quantified pharyngeal pumping rate of WT C. elegans after a 3+3+2+2 exercise regimen. We observed no difference in pumping rate at Ad5 and Ad8 but at Ad11 and Ad15, exercised animals showed a significant increase in pumping rate relative to controls (Fig. 4A). Notably, exercise health benefits to pharyngeal function become evident late in life, during the time-window of accentuated age-related decline. It is striking that even though animals are trained only on the first 4 d of adulthood, exercise-dependent effects are long lasting, and in this case maintained 11 d after the last exercise bout. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Pharyngeal and intestinal healthspans are extended after long-term swim exercise. (A) Pharyngeal pumping rate of Ad5, Ad8, Ad11, and Ad15 WT animals exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. Each point represents a single animal. n = 66 to 87 animals. (B) Representative image of non-Smurf (first and third animals from left to right) and Smurf (second and fourth animals from left to right, arrows indicate leaks) animals. (C and D) Higher-magnification images of Smurf animals showing intestinal leakage in the anterior (C) and posterior (D) regions. Arrows in B–D indicate areas of blue dye leakage into the body cavity. (Scale bars, 50 µm.) (E) Percentage of Smurf animals at Ad8, Ad11, and Ad15 in WT nematodes exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. n = 4 to 8 independent trials. *P ≤ 0.05, ***P ≤ 0.001.The C. elegans intestine is an additional tissue of central health importance, as the intestine plays critical roles in digestion and metabolism and serves as a focal signaling center for stress response and aging regulation (38). The C. elegans intestine constitutes a strong barrier to gut content leak in young animals, but with age, intestinal barrier function breaks down. Breakdown of intestinal barrier function can be measured by feeding a nonabsorbable blue dye and checking for dye leakage outside the intestine, an assay referred to as the “Smurf assay” since animals turn blue like cartoon Smurfs (39). We assayed the maintenance of gut integrity in exercised vs. nonexercised controls using the Smurf assay to confirm that animals with intestinal epithelial integrity retained the blue dye within the intestinal tract, whereas animals with a compromised intestinal barrier leak the blue dye to their body cavity (Fig. 4 B–D). We found that the percentage of Smurf animals in both control and exercise samples was very low at Ad8 after a 3+3+2+2 regimen (Fig. 4E), consistent with prior studies that revealed the later life onset of this aspect of gut decline (39). Later in life (Ad11), we found that the proportion of Smurf animals was one-third lower in exercise versus control (Fig. 4E). Differences disappeared at Ad15 (Fig. 4E). We conclude that long-term swim exercise improves intestinal integrity and function, evident for a particular time-window later in C. elegans life.Learning Ability Is Enhanced in Exercised C. elegans. Benefits to nervous system function, including learning and memory enhancement, are documented outcomes of mammalian exercise (40, 41). We therefore tested whether long-term exercise might improve associative neuronal functions in adult C. elegans. C. elegans can positively associate food with a specific chemical odor (e.g., butanone) (11, 42). We tested a paradigm in which animals are starved for 1 h followed by food-butanone conditioning in seeded NGM plates with 10% butanone for 1 h (Fig. 5A). We performed chemotaxis assays by evaluating attraction toward butanone (normally a weak attractant) vs. isoamyl alcohol (a natural strong attractant) for naïve and conditioned animals. Naïve animals (i.e., nonconditioned) are attracted almost exclusively to isoamyl alcohol, whereas a significant proportion of food-butanone–conditioned animals choose butanone over isoamyl alcohol (Fig. 5A). The increase in chemotaxis toward butanone of conditioned animals relative to naïve animals corresponds to the learning index. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Learning ability is enhanced in exercised C. elegans. (A) Diagram of the associative learning assay. After the 3+3+2+2 regimen, we starved Ad5 animals for 1 h followed by food-butanone conditioning in a seeded NGM plate with 10% butanone solution on the inside of the lid. We performed chemotaxis assays of naïve and conditioned animals by testing attraction to butanone vs. isoamyl alcohol. (B) Learning index of Ad5 WT animals 0 h postconditioning after exposure to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. Chemotaxis index (CI) = (animal number at butanone − animal number at isoamyl alcohol)/(total animal number − immobile animal number at origin). We calculated learning index by subtraction of naïve CI from postconditioning CI. n = 8 independent trials. **P ≤ 0.01.Remarkably, we find that the 3+3+2+2 regimen increased the learning index of Ad5 exercised animals by an average of 35% as compared to nonexercised control counterparts (Fig. 5B). Despite the quantifiable increase in learning ability, short-term memory of exercised animals did not significantly improve; both control and exercised animals showed a 50% reduction in learning index 0.5-h postconditioning and just a residual learning index 1-h postconditioning (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). These results reveal that long-term swim exercise enhances neuronal learning ability in adult C. elegans and raise the question as to whether specific neuronal circuits or activities may be aided by particular exercise experiences.Long-Term Swim Exercise Improves Neuronal Health in Multiple C. elegans Neurodegeneration Models. An additional measure of neuronal health is the capacity to respond to stress induced by neurotoxic proteins. We therefore sought to determine whether exercise could counter pathological conditions in C. elegans models of human neurodegenerative disease. We started by analyzing a C. elegans strain that expresses the human aggregating F3ΔK280 Tau fragment together with the full-length (FL) mutant Tau V337M in all neurons (Prab-3F3ΔK280; Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M) (43). This tauopathy model is based on mutations commonly identified in patients with frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (44). Transgenic strains exhibit robust toxicity phenotypes, including strongly impaired motility, reflected in a reduced mean velocity compared to antiaggregating strains (43). The 3+3+2+2 swim regimen led to a clear increase in mean velocity in exercised aggregating Tau animals, as assayed at Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11, relative to nonexercised control counterparts (Fig. 6A). We conclude that swim exercise can protect against the deleterious consequences of aggregating Tau. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Long-term swim exercise improves neuronal health in multiple C. elegans neurodegeneration models. (A) Mean velocity of Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11 animals expressing aggregating Tau in all neurons (Prab-3F3ΔK280; Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M) exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. Note that Tau-expressing animals did not exhibit a standard swimming motion due to impaired motility but were more active in liquid than on agar so enhanced activity during the assay was confirmed. Each point represents a single animal. n = 54 to 60 animals. (B) Representative confocal images of Ad3 animals expressing aggregating Tau in all neurons and GFP in GABAergic motor neurons (Prab-3F3ΔK280; Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M; Punc-25GFP). Arrows indicate gaps in the ventral cords. (Scale bar, 30 µm.) (C) Average number of gaps detectable in ventral and dorsal cords of Ad3 animals expressing aggregating Tau in all neurons and GFP in GABAergic motor neurons exposed to the 3+2 regimen. n = 5 independent trials. Note that this strain did not exhibit a standard swimming motion due to the severe uncoordinated phenotype, which may explain the lack of up-regulation of muscle structural genes after the 3+2 regimen (SI Appendix, Fig. S9A). Nevertheless, animals were still more active in liquid than on agar so enhanced activity was confirmed. (D) CI toward benzaldehyde of Ad3 animals expressing neuronal Aβ1–42 [smg-1(cc546ts) Psnb-1Aβ1–42::long 3′-UTR] exposed to the 3+3 regimen. We raised animals at 23 °C from the egg stage onward. CI = (animal number at benzaldehyde half − animal number at ethanol half)/(total animal number − immobile animal number at origin). n = 5 independent trials. Note that this strain swam slower than WT, which may explain the lack of significant up-regulation of muscle structural genes after the 3+3 regimen (SI Appendix, Fig. S9B). (E) Anterior touch sensitivity of Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11 animals expressing polyQ128 in the touch receptor neurons (Pmec-3htt57Q128) exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. n = 119 to 248 animals. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001.A second consequence of aggregating Tau expression in the C. elegans nervous system are severe morphological abnormalities in nerve cords, such that gaps in the ventral and dorsal cords can be observed during developmental and adult stages when GFP reporters are used for their visualization (43). We used a C. elegans strain in which the GABAergic motor neurons are GFP-labeled in the aggregating Tau background (Prab-3F3ΔK280; Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M; Punc-25GFP) (43) to quantify the number of gaps in GABAergic motor neurons in exercised vs. nonexercised control animals (Fig. 6B). We found that this strain exhibited severely uncoordinated locomotion and an overall unhealthy appearance; therefore, we elected to reduce the swim regimen to the first 2 d of adulthood and 5 swim sessions (3+2 regimen) to prevent overtraining, with analysis of cord morphology 1 d later. We find that swim-exercised Ad3 mutants exhibited a subtle but consistent decrease in the average number of gaps in GABAergic motor neurons relative to nonexercised controls (Fig. 6C). Taken together, our analysis of a tauopathy model demonstrates that swim exercise is able to improve pathological effects of neuronal aggregating Tau, both at the functional and morphological levels. We also addressed impact of exercise on a C. elegans AD model in which human amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide (1–42) is pan-neuronally expressed in a temperature-sensitive manner [smg-1(cc546ts) Psnb-1Aβ1–42::long 3′-UTR] (45). One of the phenotypes previously described in this strain is a reduced chemotactic ability toward benzaldehyde (45). When raised at 23 °C (a temperature that induces expression of Aβ1–42), chemotaxis performance of transgenic Aβ animals decreases rapidly during the first days of adulthood. We decided to limit the swim regimen for this strain to the first 2 d of adulthood (3+3 regimen) with assay at Ad3 because of the severity of chemotactic deficits exhibited at later time points (i.e., from Ad4 onward, animals exhibited virtually no chemotactic ability). We found that exercised Ad3 Aβ1–42-expressing animals exhibited a significantly higher chemotaxis index toward benzaldehyde than nonexercised control counterparts (Fig. 6D). Thus, swim exercise improves a neuronally controlled behavior in a C. elegans model of AD-associated toxicity. Finally, we tested exercise effects in a C. elegans HD model in which the first 57 amino acids of human Huntingtin protein (HTT) are fused to an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ128), and this transgene is expressed in 10 neurons including the 6 touch receptor neurons (Pmec-3htt57Q128) (46). The C. elegans touch receptor neurons mediate the response to gentle touch (47) and polyQ expression in these specific neurons greatly accelerates touch deficits during adult life (46, 48). After a 3+3+2+2 swim regimen, we performed touch sensitivity assays by quantifying the animal responsiveness to 5 gentle touches on the head or the tail at different days of adulthood blinded to previous exercise experience of the animals. We found that exercised polyQ animals exhibited a significant improvement in touch sensitivity at Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11 for the anterior region (Fig. 6E), and at Ad5 and Ad8 for the posterior region (SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Thus, long-term swim exercise in C. elegans improves neuronal healthspan in a sensitized polyQ-mediated toxicity model. Overall, our testing of exercise impact on models in which human disease proteins impair C. elegans adult neuron functions demonstrates that long-term swim exercise improves neuronal healthspan at both morphological and functional levels, for different neuronal cell types in multiple neurodegeneration models. A particularly striking corollary is that sustained early adult swim training can confer a demonstrable health benefit even long after training has ended.Swim Exercise of Postreproductive C. elegans Also Improves Locomotory Vigor. One of the remarkable features of exercise in humans is the fact that exercise has been shown to be beneficial at all ages, including older adults even if they had never exercised before (49, 50). We therefore sought to determine whether C. elegans exercise performed at a later stage of adult life could also promote health benefits. We designed an exercise regimen for postreproductive C. elegans based on 2 daily swim sessions over a period of 3 d (2+2+2 regimen) that we executed from Ad6 to Ad8 (Fig. 7A). To address potential overtraining of these older animals, we tested a shorter duration for each swim session (i.e., 60 min) in parallel with the usual 90-min swims. We found that the 2+2+2 regimen with 90-min swims promoted an increase in crawling maximum velocity of postreproductive exercised C. elegans on Ad9 but that improvement in locomotion disappeared by Ad12 (Fig. 7B). Postreproductive exercised animals that performed the 2+2+2 regimen with 60-min swims exhibited a significant improvement in crawling maximum velocity on both Ad9 and Ad12 (Fig. 7C). These results show that postreproductive C. elegans can improve locomotory vigor upon swim exercise and that modified regimen in older animals can promote effective and long-lasting exercise benefits, akin to what we described above for young adult exercise. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Swim exercise of postreproductive C. elegans also improves locomotory vigor. (A) Diagram of the 2+2+2 exercise regimen performed with postreproductive animals (from Ad6 to Ad8) indicating the time of the day of each exercise session. We tested swim sessions with a duration of 90 and 60 min. (B and C) Crawling maximum velocity of Ad9 and Ad12 WT animals exposed to the 2+2+2 regimen with swim sessions of 90 min (B) or 60 min (C). Each point represents a single animal. n = 59 to 60 animals. *P ≤ 0.05, ***P ≤ 0.001.Discussion The development of short-lived genetic models in which fundamental questions of exercise biology can be evaluated throughout the entire aging process holds great potential for advancing our knowledge on transtissue exercise signaling that improves old-age health. Here we define a long-term adult exercise regimen that induces robust exercise adaptations in multiple C. elegans tissues. We show that repeated daily swim sessions are essential for molecular, morphological, and functional adaptations at the body wall muscle level. Moreover, whole-animal health parameters, including mitochondrial respiration and midlife survival, as well as functionality of tissues that are not directly involved in physical activity, such as pharynx and intestine, are improved by regular exercise. Exercise benefits to learning ability and to mitigating symptoms of neuronal pathologies in tauopathy, AD, and HD C. elegans models can accompany regular swimming in young adulthood. Particularly noteworthy is that we find benefits of exercise regimens in young adult life that can be documented to extend late into life after the regular exercise period ends, a finding that suggests a potential switch mechanism for healthy aging trajectories might be triggered by even limited early enhanced activity. How C. elegans Trains for Sustained Adult Health. We found that multiple swim sessions per day, occurring over several days, are essential for exercise-dependent molecular and functional adaptations in C. elegans. Using muscle gene expression and locomotion performance as readouts, we identified the 3+3+2+2 regimen as the most consistent protocol that induces long-term exercise adaptations. Although we expect that particular health and fitness readouts might require a slightly adjusted multiple daily swim regimen to induce optimal exercise adaptation for a given parameter, the 3+3+2+2 protocol does confer a broad swath of health improvements. Our data establishing the need for repeated exercise as required for health adaptations may partially explain the lack of mitochondrial adaptations and survival improvement previously reported for a vibration C. elegans exercise model (17) and the lack of locomotion improvement in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy C. elegans model swim-exercised 90 min per day (18), as these studies did not include exercise training in consecutive days or multiple times per day. The transient increase in physical activity during an exercise bout and the following postexercise recovery period are crucial for long-lasting exercise adaptation in mammals (27, 51). We introduced a 4.5-h minimum interval between swim sessions in our exercise regimens based on our previous documentation that most acute exercise changes return to baseline levels by 4-h postexercise (13). As rest and recovery appears to be important to instituting positive outcomes of exercise, we suggest that recently described regimens in C. elegans based on continuous burrowing or swimming over several days (18) may need to incorporate activity breaks to accomplish long-term benefits. We also note that our data indicate that the exercise regimen should be reduced to prevent overtraining and consequent deleterious effects when working with strains with severe health deficits or older age animals. For example, a 4+4+4+4 regimen led to a decrease in overall health due to overtraining, which was particularly evident from the reduction in midlife survival of 4+4+4+4 exercised animals. For nematodes and humans, then, recovery and moderation are factors in exercise health outcomes.Systemic Benefits of Exercise. Longevity. A majority of human exercise studies support that exercise can reduce mortality risk and increase longevity of healthy subjects, patients, and elite athletes, although some studies suggest a negative or neutral association between exercise and lifespan in humans (33–36). A fair generalization may be that the extent of the exercise benefits is variable and dependent in part on the type of exercise, the population studied, and the particular outcomes recorded. Similar to observations in humans, the effect of exercise on C. elegans longevity seems to be highly dependent on the adopted exercise regimen with reported outcomes in previous studies varying from detrimental to beneficial (14–18). Our 3+3+2+2 swim exercise regimen promoted a consistent increase in midlife population survival rather than an increase in maximum lifespan. Thus, exercised populations are able to survive extra days during the time-window when the mortality rate is at its peak. It is important to note that in our studies, this time-window occurs 8 to 16 d after the last exercise session, raising the possibility that extension of the swim regimen beyond the first 4 d of adulthood may further potentiate survival differences and underscoring that early adult activity can have long lasting impact on healthy aging.Nonexercising cardiac-like muscle. One of the pressing questions in exercise biology is how physical activity can promote health benefits in multiple tissues of the body, especially in those tissues not directly engaged by neuromuscular activity. We found that long-term swim exercise in C. elegans increases pharyngeal pumping rate during midlife, reflecting a delay in the age-associated decline of cardiac-like muscle function (37). In the case of C. elegans, the pumping mechanism is inhibited rather than accelerated during swim training, so the pharyngeal muscle itself does not “train,” yet pharyngeal functional health nonetheless improves with exercise. Our observations raise the possibility that some exercise benefits to human heart might be conferred via transtissue signals rather than exercise-enhanced heart contraction.Intestinal integrity. We also observed a significant improvement of the older age intestinal barrier function in exercised C. elegans, establishing that enhanced gut health is a systemic effect of exercise experience. In humans, exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (52), although high-intensity, prolonged exercise sessions will cause an acute increase in intestinal permeability (or “leaky gut”) (53), which has been associated with infectious diseases, obesity, and autoimmune diseases (54). We suggest that an exercise-dependent hormetic effect on intestinal function can reconcile these apparently contradictory findings: Acute exercise bouts may enhance intestinal permeability, but regular exercise training will promote intestinal adaptation over time that might enhance intestinal barrier function, similar to what we detected in C. elegans.Age-associated neuronal decline and neurodegeneration stresses. Our study presents clear evidence that exercise in C. elegans promotes neuronal health at multiple levels. Kauffman et al. (11) have shown that the learning process is molecularly distinct from memory formation; and that capacity for learning declines with age. We show that learning ability is markedly increased in swim-exercised WT animals, whereas short-term memory retention is not significantly improved by the exercise regimen we implement here. Interestingly, other longevity paradigms have been reported to have focused impact on particular components of the learning/memory process (11): Dietary-restricted eat-2 mutants retain the ability to learn for longer and maintain short- and long-term memory with age, but daf-2 reduced insulin signaling mutants retain the ability to learn for longer but lose long-term memory at the same rate as WT (11). Overall, the fact that swim exercise enhances adult learning capacity reveals that particular neuronal capabilities can be improved as a result of animal activity and adds maintained neuronal function to the list of healthspan benefits of exercise in C. elegans. Numerous studies in animal models and humans show that exercise can improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of developing dementia later in life (40, 41). However, the effect of exercise on dementia patients is not clear, with outcomes of published studies ranging from detrimental to beneficial exercise outcomes (55–58). Taking advantage of neurodegeneration models of human disease in C. elegans, we show that swim exercise improves neuronal healthspan in disease protein-stressed neurons, at both morphological and functional levels, for different neuronal cell types. We detected exercise-dependent health benefits for motor neurons, chemosensory neurons, and touch receptor neurons in tauopathy, AD, and HD conditions, respectively, revealing a broad impact of exercise in maintaining health in the C. elegans nervous system confronted with disease stresses. Exercise prescription by primary care physicians is currently recommended as a way to improve patients’ general health and reduce all-cause mortality (59). Our data strengthen the case that exercise can have powerful beneficial effects on neurodegenerative disease conditions. Overall, the documentation of transtissue impact of exercise makes it clear that C. elegans can be used as a model for the detailed mechanistic dissection of the molecular and tissue circuits that maintain animal vigor as a consequence of exercise.Exercise during Early Adult Life Can Have Clear Long-Term Impact on Later Adult Health. We show in this study that long-term swim exercise in C. elegans induces health benefits at the body wall muscle, pharyngeal, intestinal, and neuronal levels. Remarkably, most of the exercise-dependent benefits are long lasting, with effects still detectable up to 7 to 16 d after the last exercise session for specific assays. Moreover, even exercise in postreproductive C. elegans can promote long-lasting locomotory improvements. Interestingly, a recent study shows that human volunteers who enrolled in an 8-mo exercise regimen still exhibit improvements in aerobic capacity and metabolic health 10 y after completion of exercise training (60). Thus, persistent health benefits of previous exercise training may be conserved from nematodes to humans. If so, the establishment of C. elegans as an exercise model opens the exciting possibility of uncovering the molecular signals responsible for life-long, exercise-dependent systemic health benefits.Materials and Methods C. elegans Strains and Maintenance. The C. elegans strains used in this study were: N2 (WT strain), SJ4103 zcIs14[Pmyo-3mitoGFP] (61), BR6563 byIs161[Prab-3F3ΔK280; Pmyo-2mCherry]; bkIs10[Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M; Pmyo-2GFP] (43), BR5707 byIs161[Prab-3F3ΔK280; Pmyo-2mCherry]; bkIs10[Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M; Pmyo-2GFP]; juIs73[Punc-25GFP] III (43), CL2355 smg-1(cc546ts) dvIs50[Psnb-1Aβ1–42::long 3′-UTR Pmtl-2GFP] I (45), and ID1 igIs1[Pmec-3htt57Q128::CFP, Pmec-7YFP, lin-15(+)] (46). We maintained nematodes at 20 °C on NGM plates seeded with live E. coli OP50-1, as previously described (62), unless otherwise stated.Long-Term Swim Exercise Protocols. We used 2 different methods for our long-term swim exercise experiments: The picking method and the washing method. We performed the picking method for all of the experiments presented in this study, except for the oxygen consumption rates and associative learning assays in which we used the washing method due to the high number of animals required for each assay. Details are in SI Appendix.Other Assays.

    "abstract": "Abstract Biology experiments in space seek to increase our understanding of what happens to life beyond Earth and how we can safely send life beyond Earth. Spaceflight is associated with many (mal)adaptations in physiology, including decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems. Biological experiments in space are inherently challenging to implement. Development of hardware and validation of experimental conditions are critical to ensure the collection of high-quality data. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has been studied in space for more than 20 years to better understand spaceflight-induced (patho)physiology, particularly spaceflight-induced muscle decline. These experiments have used a variety of hardware configurations. Despite this, hardware used in the past was not available for our most recent experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME). Therefore, we had to design and validate flight hardware for MME. MME provides a contemporary example of many of the challenges faced by researchers conducting C. elegans experiments onboard the International Space Station. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation, in addition to the ground-based experiment scientific validation testing. These experiences and operational solutions allow others to replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions. Key Words: Spaceflight, Space biology, Astrobiology, C. elegans—",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Space is an extreme environment in which humans have been routinely living and working for more than 20 years, and ambitions remain to live and work further beyond Earth. Spaceflight is associated with deconditioning of multiple bodily systems, including the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems (Demontis et al., 2017; Strollo et al., 2018). Physiological decline occurs despite participation in exercise countermeasures, which are a potent stimulus to promote musculoskeletal and cardiovascular adaptation (Trappe et al., 2009) and optimal immune function (Simpson et al., 2015) on Earth. While vestibular adaptations take place in the first days after transition to the microgravity environment, decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems can worsen with missions of greater duration (Fitts et al., 2010; Strollo et al., 2018), potentially limiting our capacity for interplanetary missions such as to Mars (Gaffney et al., 2017). These challenges have motivated research around strategies to prevent this (mal)adaptation in space. As the precise molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced physiological deconditioning have not been identified, this limits our ability to design molecularly rationalized countermeasures. Biological experiments in space can, however, be methodologically challenging. Although the United States has designated the US segment of the International Space Station (ISS) as a National Laboratory, experiments are not routinely carried out by using standardized equipment or methods that are in common use in other laboratories on Earth. Size, power, mass, late access for experiment integration onto the rocket, and ability to oversee the experiment remain challenges, despite more than 40 years of conducting biology experiments in space. Thus, the development of hardware and the validation of experimental conditions remain critical in the acquisition of quality data that can ultimately promote understanding of biological changes in space that should underpin rationale countermeasures to physiological changes in space. Our current experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME), uses the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, to explore the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy. C. elegans is an established model organism for studies on Earth (Kaletta and Hengartner, 2006; Corsi et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2018) and in space (Szewczyk et al., 2008; Higashitani et al., 2009; Honda et al., 2012, 2014; Higashibata et al., 2016). In the context of very limited access to space, the short life span and microscopic size of C. elegans enable data to be collected across the entire life span (Gaffney et al., 2018a) in high n numbers and replicates to generate robust data rapidly. The operational requirements of MME include many that apply to biological payloads across species (e.g., late access, temperature-controlled upload/download, and time critical astronaut interventions). MME is therefore a generalizable example of many of the challenges in conducting contemporary astrobiology research onboard the ISS. C. elegans have been studied in space for more than 20 years by using a variety of spaceflight hardware configurations (Ishioka and Higashibata, 2019). With the exception of STS-107 (Szewczyk et al., 2005), all past flights involved in the study of C. elegans have used nonstandard laboratory hardware. It is therefore not surprising that C. elegans spaceflight experiments can fail due to lack of sufficient oxygen to support the worms (Warren et al., 2013), a problem that can be dealt with through preflight ground testing. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation in addition to the ground-based experiment sequence validation testing for MME. The first key challenge was overcoming the difficulty of growing worms inside plastic bags. The second key challenge was working out timings to allow upload to the ISS using passive temperature control. These studies should allow other researchers to replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Nematode and bacteria preparation The C. elegans strain PD55 (ccIs55 (unc-54::lacZ) V) was used for development and testing phases of this study. Animals were cultured at 20°C by using standard methods on nematode growth media plates. To obtain L1 animals, age synchronizations were carried out by gravity settling as described previously (Gaffney et al., 2014). During the hardware development phases, Escherichia coli OP50 was grown overnight in LB-broth, centrifuged, and resuspended in S-Basal; 500 or 5000 L1 were used in experiments with 3–10 mL of OP50. During the hardware development phases and all experimentation unless stipulated otherwise, stocks were prepared by adding 5000 L1 larvae to 6 mL of freeze-dried OP50 (LabTie; StartLife, Netherlands) in S-Basal. Freeze-dried OP50 was made by using LabTie's protocol of 1 vial per 250 mL S-Basal. To streamline procedures for launch preparation, worms to be flown (PD55 (ccIs55 (unc-54::lacZ) V), CF1038 (daf-16 (mu86) I), CF1139 (daf-16 (mu86) I; muIs61 (daf-16::GFP)?), PJ1145 (ccIs55 (unc-54::lacZ) V; njEx38 (unc-54p::daf-2(+) + goa-1p::GFP + rol-6 (su1006))), DM2 (dim-1 (ra102) X)) were cultured in freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal in 75 cm2 cell culture flasks. Animals were cultured for a minimum of 2 weeks following transfer from plates before synchronization. During final preflight testing of the launch procedures, age synchronizations were carried out from liquid culture stocks rather than from plates to obtain 5000 L1 larvae the day before loading into bags. These cultures were left overnight in 6-well tissue culture dishes in a final volume of 500 μL freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal at 20°C. The next day, 6 mL freeze-dried OP50 was pipetted into each well before loading into flight culture bags. 2.2. Validation of culture bags The experimental design for launch involved growing worms inside gas-permeable plastic bags onboard the ISS. Therefore, we tested the biocompatibility of three different bag materials: (i) polyethylene (PE) bags (1.5 inch, 250 gauge, Lay Flat Polythene Tubing; Kite Packaging Ltd., United Kingdom), (ii) Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) PE bags (Nipro, Japan), and (iii) fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) bags (Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics; TOSS GmbH, Germany). The PE bags and FEP bags are low friction and allow good gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, although gas exchange is reported to be superior in FEP to PE in bags of equal thickness (NB. all bags have previously supported C. elegans cultures in spaceflight experiments onboard the ISS). The JAXA bags are a proprietary PE blend that is no longer commercially available. To test the bags, 5000 L1 larvae were placed in the bag with OP50 before bags were heat sealed (Pacseal+ impulse heat sealer; Rajapack, United Kingdom), and then, the worms were cultured for 7 days at 20°C. After 7 days, the total worm population in each bag was counted. Three biological replicates were carried out per condition. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out in GraphPad Prism to compare the populations of worms in the three bags. 2.3. Oxygen consumption rates To investigate whether diet influenced changes in oxygen consumption rates (OCR), measurements were carried out with the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), as previously described (Hewitt et al., 2018; Koopman et al., 2016). Worms were cultured in either chemically defined media [C. elegans maintenance media, CeMM (Szewczyk et al., 2003), purchased from Cell Guidance Systems custom media service, United Kingdom], or freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal. Adult animals were washed twice in incubation media [M9 buffer: 22.04 mM KH2PO4, 42.27 mM Na2HPO4, 85.56 mM NaCl (final concentrations, sterilized)] and placed in 200 μL M9-filled wells of standard Seahorse plates (20 worms/well) in 5 replicates per condition. Stable OCR measurements were taken by performing five measurement cycles for basal OCR, nine cycles for maximal OCR following the addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (10 μM final well concentration), and five cycles for nonmitochondrial OCR following the addition of sodium azide (40 nM final well concentration). OCR measurements were normalized to the number of worms per well. To obtain stable OCR measurements, the final three, seven, and two measurement cycles were used for the statistical analysis of basal, maximal, and nonmitochondrial OCR, respectively, as previously described (Hewitt et al., 2018). Differences in OCR were detected with a one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism 8 (La Jolla, CA). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. 2.4. Culture volume optimization Age-synchronized L1 larvae were placed into experimental bags containing freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal (5000 L1 worms per bag). The amount of OP50 in the bag was optimized where 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 mL volumes were tested. Three biological replicates were carried out per condition. 2.5. Hardware development and validation For flight, the experimental bags were to be placed into European Space Agency (ESA) experiment cassettes (ECs). As C. elegans require oxygen to develop, gas exchange between the inside of the EC and outside of the EC is required. ECs that allowed gas exchange via a gas-permeable Gortex membrane have previously been used with C. elegans onboard the ISS (Szewczyk et al., 2008); unfortunately, these were no longer available for use with MME. Therefore, we had to design (Fig. 1) and validate new ECs (Kayser Italia, Livorno, Italy). FIG. 1. Open in a new tab Hardware for the MME. Images of the hardware used for the experiment include (A) the first cage prototype and (B) the second cage prototype developed by Kayser Italia. (C) The assembly of experimental bags and cages within the EC. EC, experiment cassette; MME, Molecular Muscle Experiment. Color image is available online.To validate how well worms would grow inside the ECs, three bags each loaded with 5000 L1 worms and 6 mL freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal were cultured inside the EC for 1 week at 20°C. Once complete, the population of viable worms in the bags were counted under a dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ645; Nikon, Japan) and compared against control bags that were otherwise identical except were located outside the EC. Two different cage inserts for the ECs were designed and tested to maintain separation between the bags during the turbulent upload phase of launch, to maintain a surface area for gas exchange in flight, and to prevent the bags from freezing together at the end of the experiment. To test which cage design was best, worms were grown in bags alone, in cage design 1, and in cage design 2. Upon selection of cage design 2, further testing was carried out by growing worms in bags alone, in cage 2 alone, and in cage 2 inside an EC. Three biological replicates were carried out per condition. 2.6. Validation of experimental timings As MME was to be uploaded in an active state (e.g., worms were not placed in stasis), and as launches to the ISS are often associated with delays due to inclement weather or technical problems, we needed to validate our experimental design to confirm that it could withstand launch delays. To test this, we obtained upload times from handover to installation on the ISS from NASA cold stowage for previous SpaceX launches (Table 1), as well as data for the performance of 10°C and 12°C ICE Bricks passive upload cold stowage phase change material over upload to ISS time frames. Table 1.

Following upload scenario testing, we ran the full experiment simulating a scheduled launch, a 24 h delay, and a 48 h delay. Following these simulations, the total worm populations were counted and compared with the nominal (on-time) launch scenario. A nominal launch scenario is associated with the generation of >45,000 worms per bag, which is the requirement for postflight analysis. To determine whether our experimental design could withstand a 24 or 48 h delay, we set a matched population threshold of >45,000 worms per bag at the end of the experiment.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Evaluation and selection of culture bags Several previous spaceflight experiments have grown worms in liquid culture inside plastic experimental bags (Selch et al., 2008; Szewczyk et al., 2008; Higashitani et al., 2009); in some cases, worms were grown with an OP50 diet, in others with a CeMM diet. While it is not usual to grow C. elegans inside plastic bags on Earth, containment of liquid is a safety requirement onboard the ISS. We therefore sought to establish a plastic culture bag that would allow worm growth for MME. We evaluated three culture bags based on past use in C. elegans flight experiments. Unsurprisingly, the PE bags we selected to replicate the bags used on ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk et al., 2008) and the JAXA bags we selected to replicate the bags used on CERISE (Higashitani et al., 2009) performed well at supporting worm growth (Fig. 2). However, the FEP bags we selected to replicate bags tested on Earth (Szewczyk et al., 2003) for flight use failed to support growth, with more than half of the worms actually dying in the bags (Fig. 2). FIG. 2. Open in a new tab Growth of Caenorhabditis elegans in different plastic culture bags. Five thousand L1 larvae were loaded in standard Petri dishes, PE bags, JAXA bags, or FEP bags and cultured for 1 week at 20°C (all conditions in triplicate). Growth in PE bags was not significantly different from Petri dish controls, whereas both JAXA (**p < 0.01) and FEP (****p < 0.0001) have reduced growth compared with controls. Both PE and JAXA produce viable numbers of worms for the analysis requirements, whereas FEP do not.

Diet induces changes in OCR Given that past ground tests with FEP bags (Szewczyk et al., 2003) and a past flight with culture chambers utilizing FEP for gas exchange (Oczypok et al., 2012) successfully supported C. elegans growth, we wanted to understand why FEP bags did not work in our ground testing (Fig. 2). Since both past reports of use of FEP involved growing worms in CeMM rather than the OP50 diet used in MME, we were curious if the failure to grow was due to the food source. Worms grown in CeMM take longer to develop, have longer life expectancies, exhibit altered gene expression, and exhibit the characteristics of dietary restriction (Szewczyk et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2015). Given the physiological and gene expression changes in CeMM-grown worms, we hypothesized that worms grown in CeMM have differences in metabolism compared with those grown in OP50. To examine whether these different diets alter metabolism, we used the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Agilent) to measure oxygen consumption in worms grown chronically in CeMM and OP50. As shown in Fig. 3, worms grown in CeMM have significantly lower basal levels of oxygen consumption. This suggests that OP50-grown worms could have been limited for oxygen inside the FEP bags, whereas the CeMM grown worms were not. The use of CeMM rather than OP50 as a food source may therefore reduce the oxygen exchange requirement and thus increase the viability of worm experiments conducted inside plastic culture bags on the ISS. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab C. elegans grown on a bacterial diet display increased oxygen consumption compared with a chemically defined diet. Twenty adult worms grown on bacterial diet (OP50) or chemically defined diet (CeMM) were analyzed in a Seahorse XF Analyzer (n = 5 replicates per condition). In both the basal state (***p < 0.001) and in the maximal state following injection of FCCP (****p < 0.0001), oxygen consumption rates are significantly higher in OP50 compared with CeMM. **p < 0.01.

Optimizing culture volume in the flight bags Having determined that gas exchange was a limiting factor for worm growth inside plastic culture bags, we re-evaluated the surface area to volume ratio of our bags versus past flights CERISE (Higashitani et al., 2009) and ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk et al., 2008) as this ratio also influences oxygen availability for the worms within the bags. As shown in Fig. 4, the surface area to volume ratio for CERISE, which used the OP50 diet, was 8.4 cm2/mL, whereas the ratio for ICE-FIRST, which used the CeMM diet, was 10 cm2/mL. We therefore maintained the size of the bag and altered the volume of worms + OP50 feed solution, testing volumes between 3 and 10 mL. Based on CERISE, which used JAXA bags, we expected a ratio of around 8.4 cm2/mL, which equates to a little more than 7 mL of liquid culture in the bag. FIG. 4. Open in a new tab Optimization of culture volume in PE bags. (A) Volume of liquid culture and surface area to volume ratio in CERISE, ICE-FIRST, and MME. (B) Worm population size after starting with 5000 L1 worms, which were allowed to grow for 7 days at 20°C (n = 3 replicates), using different culture volumes in PE. Worm growth is optimal between 5 and 7 mL culture volume with a surface area to volume ratio in the range of 10 cm2/mL.To preserve the limited available stocks of JAXA bags and to validate materials readily available for future flights, we used PE bags instead of the JAXA bags for testing. Testing with PE bags (Fig. 4) revealed that the maximum volume in the PE culture bag should be 6–7 mL, which is roughly consistent with the past performance of the JAXA bags during CERISE. Together, these results highlight the importance of considering and testing surface area for gas exchange when designing C. elegans spaceflight experiments involving liquid cultures. 3.4. Flight hardware validation The culture bags were to be held within ECs to provide an additional level of containment, thus increasing the safety of the crew as well as protecting the cultures themselves from launch and/or in-flight damage. As shown in Fig. 1, cages to contain the bags within the ECs were designed to enforce space between the culture bags during launch, ensure gas exchange, and prevent culture bags from freezing together at the end of the experiment. As shown in Fig. 5, when culture bags were used either outside or inside cage design 2, which had more space between the bags, there was no significant difference in worm growth. In contrast, cage design 1, which had less space between the bags, had significantly less growth than outside the cage. Thus, cage design 2 was adopted for MME. FIG. 5. Open in a new tab Growth of worms within prototype cages. Five hundred L1 worms were grown in culture bags for 7 days at 20°C, either within or not within a cage design (n = 3 replicates). Worm growth was lower in cage 1 compared with no cage (**p < 0.01), whereas there was no significant difference in worm growth between no cage and cage 2.Next, growth in the culture bags inside the ECs with or without the cages was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6, no significant differences in worm growth were noted for worms grown in PE culture bags outside or inside cage design 2, confirming prior testing (Fig. 5). Furthermore, there were no significant differences for worms grown in PE culture bags alone versus inside the combined cage and ECs. FIG. 6. Open in a new tab Validating growth of worms within the full experimental design. Five thousand L1 worms were grown in PE culture bags for 7 days at 20°C (n = 3 replicates). Three bags were grown without additional hardware, three bags were placed in the cage without the cassette, and three bags were placed in the complete experimental container (cage and cassette, Fig. 1). No significant differences in growth were observed. 3.5. Optimizing culture conditions for upload To allow for comparison of our anticipated gene expression data with gene expression data from ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk et al., 2008) and CERISE (Higashitani et al., 2009), it was important that we time our cultures to enter adulthood following birth and development in space. As our experiment did not involve an activation step like CERISE, we conducted it as a timed upload like ICE-FIRST. However, for MME, the launch vehicle was SpaceX's Dragon and not Russia's Soyuz, and active temperature control during upload was not preferred from an operations perspective. Therefore, as SpaceX's Dragon is frequently subjected to launch delays and as phase change materials could be used to maintain temperature during upload, it was important that we test various upload scenarios to establish working timings for upload to the ISS such that the worms were at an appropriate developmental stage, population density, and had not run out of food. As shown in Table 2, we started testing with fixed temperature of a duration calculated to allow P0 animals to grow to adulthood during upload (days 1–3/4) and the F1 generation to grow to mid-adulthood after living only in the spaceflight environment (days 3–8). We found that this duration exhausted our food source as evidenced by lack of visible food and presence of Dauer larvae. Reducing growth by 1 day resulted in viable worms of sufficient numbers for analysis (Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 6). Table 2. Operation Scenarios Tested Duration Temperature profile Outcome 8 Days 20°C Not viable, ran out of food 7 Days 20°C Viable, no Dauer larvae 1 Day 12°C Viable +6.5 Days 20°C 8 Days 12°C Some tests ran out of food around day 5.5 at 20°C +6.5 Days 20°C 3 Days 12°C Viable +6 Days 20°C 8 Days 12°C Viable, food close to exhaustion +6 Days 20°C 8 Days NASA 12°C phase change Ran out of food around day 5 at 20°C +6 Days 20°C 8 Days NASA 10°C phase change Viable +6 Days 20°C 5 Days NASA 10°C phase change Viable +6 Days 20°C Open in a new tabUnfortunately, with a maximum possible late turnover of payload at launch of—24 h, 3 days from turnover until installation in an incubator onboard the ISS was not a realistic timeline to produce viable animal cultures. Thus, for the timelines/late handover scenario associated with a Dragon launch scenario, similar to ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk et al., 2008), we would require active temperature control throughout upload. We therefore moved on to test other scenarios that were, from an operations perspective, preferred. We next tested the effect of cold incubation during the prelaunch (1 day) or prelaunch plus longest reported cold stowage upload via Dragon (Table 2, 8 days). For these tests, we also reduced the time of culturing at 20°C by half a day as we anticipated some level of development to occur while at 12°C. As shown in Table 2, chilling of the cultures for the day between handover and launch allowed for viable cultures, subjected to the same operational issues as when culturing at 20°C, whereas 8 days of chilling the cultures did not allow for all cultures tested to be viable. We therefore tested short cold stowage upload (1 day handover to launch with 2 days from launch to the ISS) and longest reported cold stowage upload via Dragon (8 days) with a further half-day reduction in the time of culturing at 20°C. As shown in Table 2, both short and long cold stowage followed by 6 days of incubation produced viable cultures. These results suggested that even the longest duration cold stowage followed by a period of incubation onboard the ISS would be a suitable operational solution for MME. As passive rather than active temperature control was preferred for upload operations, we tested the effect of passive cold stowage using NASA's phase change materials. Given that 12°C active temperature control during upload produced viable cultures, we first tested NASA's 12°C phase change materials temperature profile during long upload. As shown in Table 2, long cold stowage when using NASA's 12°C phase change materials temperature profile did not produce viable cultures, with worms running out of food about 1 day before the end of the incubation at 20°C. This result may appear surprising; however, the phase change material starts at 10°C and ramps up to 14°C over the period of cold stowage. Thus, from an engineering perspective, the 12°C phase change materials do indeed maintain 12°C ± 2°C, but from a biological perspective, this is quite different from the 12°C ± 0.5°C achieved via active temperature control. Confirming that 10°C phase change materials also maintain within +/−2°C, we tested long cold stowage using NASA's 10°C phase change materials temperature profile, which did produce viable cultures (Table 2). Having confirmed a viable passive stowage upload scenario for MME, we finally tested the impact of a short upload scenario with the 10°C phase change materials (1 day turnover to launch, 3 days to station, 1 day to put in incubator) and found that this also produced viable cultures (Table 2). Thus, through various iterations of testing that included what we might do to culture worms in our own laboratory, to implementing operational restrictions imposed by launch and upload to the ISS coupled with a better understanding of passive cold stowage performance, we were able to achieve a viable experimental protocol. Importantly, the data from this testing also inform of the ability of the experimental protocol to perform in other, off-nominal scenarios. 3.6. Validation of launch procedures, upload timings, and simulated incubation on the ISS Having finalized an operationally acceptable upload scenario, we prepared for flight. First, to help increase the visibility of our outreach efforts (Gaffney et al., 2018b), we developed and finalized a mission logo (Fig. 7). This was distributed to ∼2000 members of the public, mainly school children, between final ground testing and launch and created a “brand” for our experiment that was used by the UK government and media, which reached an estimated 41 million people. FIG. 7. Open in a new tab MME mission logo.Second, in consultation with ESA, we agreed a nominal launch scenario to be used in our final testing (Fig. 8A) as well as to assess the impact of a 24- and 48-h launch delay on our finalized experimental timeline. Note that a notional period of time (7 days) was used to simulate time in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) before download of the samples back to Earth. As shown in Fig. 8B, cultures from the nominal and both launch delay scenarios grew as expected. FIG. 8. Open in a new tab Final experimental timeline verification test.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion The desired culture bag and EC hardware used in the past were not available for use with MME. Therefore, what should have been a straightforward repurposing of previously flown hardware became a program of work to redesign and revalidate flight hardware. This entailed dealing with the frequent challenges of successfully designing and flying an experiment to the ISS: use and validation of nonstandard laboratory hardware and validation of experimental timings for upload of biologically active experiments to the ISS. We evaluated three culture bags based on past use in C. elegans flight experiments. Unsurprisingly, two of the bags selected to replicate bags used in previous flight performed well. However, one of the bags selected, made of FEP, was not compatible with worm growth despite having previously been used. This result was particularly striking as FEP is reported to have better gas exchange properties than PE and is why FEP bags are used to fly cell culture experiments (Vassy et al., 2001). Upon closer inspection of the specifications of the PE and FEP bags, it was clear that the PE bags were half as thick as the FEP bags and therefore performed better as a gas exchange surface despite worse performance as a material. As both PE and FEP bags are nonstandard equipment for growing C. elegans, these findings highlight the importance of properly testing proposed flight hardware before flight, as selecting FEP bags for better gas exchange and ease of use properties (e.g., the capacity to load animals into bags via injection ports) was the operational preference before testing. Having uncovered that gas exchange did appear to be a concern for growing worms in plastic bags, we tested if culture volume to gas exchange surface area impacted culture growth. Unsurprisingly, we found that it did, which enabled us to optimize culture volume for MME, something not done for ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk et al., 2008). We also examined worm oxygen consumption using the diet from ICE-FIRST, CeMM (Szewczyk et al., 2008), and the diet from CERISE, OP50 (Higashitani et al., 2009). Consistent with the biological changes for worms grown in CeMM (Szewczyk et al., 2003, 2006), we found that the worms consumed less oxygen. Collectively, our results suggest that growing worms in plastic culture bags does pose a challenge to worm experiment viability. The use of CeMM rather than OP50 as a food source may therefore reduce the oxygen exchange requirement and thus increase the viability of worm experiments conducted inside plastic culture bags on the ISS, but this comes with the added challenge that CeMM is more prone to become contaminated. Regardless, it remains clear that proper ground testing is required preflight despite past successful C. elegans spaceflight experiments. Additionally, in contrast to challenges with experimental bags and gas exchange, the development of new ECs, similarly dependent on effective surface area to volume ratios, presented no problems. Gas exchange in the ECs was capable of producing a viable experiment. This result suggests that for future experiments it is likely that gas exchange between the C. elegans culture and ISS will be limited principally by the exchange properties of the culture bags and not the ECs. The second most challenging portion of our preflight testing was testing and finalizing suitable scenarios for upload to the ISS that were consistent both with current operational realities and with successfully conducting our experiment. The data on durations from payload handover until integration on the ISS provided us with a realistic range of upload timings and should prove useful for others planning to upload via Dragon with NASA cold stowage. Using these timings, we were able to establish that a C. elegans payload can be kept in a stasis during cold upload at 8–12°C, then subsequently grow and reproduce effectively. Of note, while the use of phase change material removed the need for active temperature control during upload, it was critical that we tested the performance of the phase change material temperature profile. Indeed, for biologically active cultures, phase change material provides a significantly different temperature profile than active temperature control.",

Copyright notice ID: 7415877 PMID: 32267726 Abstract Biology experiments in space seek to increase our understanding of what happens to life beyond Earth and how we can safely send life beyond Earth. Spaceflight is associated with many (mal)adaptations in physiology, including decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems. Biological experiments in space are inherently challenging to implement. Development of hardware and validation of experimental conditions are critical to ensure the collection of high-quality data. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has been studied in space for more than 20 years to better understand spaceflight-induced (patho)physiology, particularly spaceflight-induced muscle decline. These experiments have used a variety of hardware configurations. Despite this, hardware used in the past was not available for our most recent experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME). Therefore, we had to design and validate flight hardware for MME. MME provides a contemporary example of many of the challenges faced by researchers conducting C. elegans experiments onboard the International Space Station. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation, in addition to the ground-based experiment scientific validation testing. These experiences and operational solutions allow others to replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions. Key Words: Spaceflight, Space biology, Astrobiology, C. elegans—1. Introduction Space is an extreme environment in which humans have been routinely living and working for more than 20 years, and ambitions remain to live and work further beyond Earth. Spaceflight is associated with deconditioning of multiple bodily systems, including the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems (Demontis et al., 2017; Strollo et al., 2018). Physiological decline occurs despite participation in exercise countermeasures, which are a potent stimulus to promote musculoskeletal and cardiovascular adaptation (Trappe et al., 2009) and optimal immune function (Simpson et al., 2015) on Earth. While vestibular adaptations take place in the first days after transition to the microgravity environment, decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems can worsen with missions of greater duration (Fitts et al., 2010; Strollo et al., 2018), potentially limiting our capacity for interplanetary missions such as to Mars (Gaffney et al., 2017). These challenges have motivated research around strategies to prevent this (mal)adaptation in space. As the precise molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced physiological deconditioning have not been identified, this limits our ability to design molecularly rationalized countermeasures. Biological experiments in space can, however, be methodologically challenging. Although the United States has designated the US segment of the International Space Station (ISS) as a National Laboratory, experiments are not routinely carried out by using standardized equipment or methods that are in common use in other laboratories on Earth. Size, power, mass, late access for experiment integration onto the rocket, and ability to oversee the experiment remain challenges, despite more than 40 years of conducting biology experiments in space. Thus, the development of hardware and the validation of experimental conditions remain critical in the acquisition of quality data that can ultimately promote understanding of biological changes in space that should underpin rationale countermeasures to physiological changes in space. Our current experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME), uses the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, to explore the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy. C. elegans is an established model organism for studies on Earth (Kaletta and Hengartner, 2006; Corsi et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2018) and in space (Szewczyk et al., 2008; Higashitani et al., 2009; Honda et al., 2012, 2014; Higashibata et al., 2016). In the context of very limited access to space, the short life span and microscopic size of C. elegans enable data to be collected across the entire life span (Gaffney et al., 2018a) in high n numbers and replicates to generate robust data rapidly. The operational requirements of MME include many that apply to biological payloads across species (e.g., late access, temperature-controlled upload/download, and time critical astronaut interventions). MME is therefore a generalizable example of many of the challenges in conducting contemporary astrobiology research onboard the ISS. C. elegans have been studied in space for more than 20 years by using a variety of spaceflight hardware configurations (Ishioka and Higashibata, 2019). With the exception of STS-107 (Szewczyk et al., 2005), all past flights involved in the study of C. elegans have used nonstandard laboratory hardware. It is therefore not surprising that C. elegans spaceflight experiments can fail due to lack of sufficient oxygen to support the worms (Warren et al., 2013), a problem that can be dealt with through preflight ground testing. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation in addition to the ground-based experiment sequence validation testing for MME. The first key challenge was overcoming the difficulty of growing worms inside plastic bags. The second key challenge was working out timings to allow upload to the ISS using passive temperature control. These studies should allow other researchers to replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Nematode and bacteria preparation The C. elegans strain PD55 (ccIs55 (unc-54::lacZ) V) was used for development and testing phases of this study. Animals were cultured at 20°C by using standard methods on nematode growth media plates. To obtain L1 animals, age synchronizations were carried out by gravity settling as described previously (Gaffney et al., 2014). During the hardware development phases, Escherichia coli OP50 was grown overnight in LB-broth, centrifuged, and resuspended in S-Basal; 500 or 5000 L1 were used in experiments with 3–10 mL of OP50. During the hardware development phases and all experimentation unless stipulated otherwise, stocks were prepared by adding 5000 L1 larvae to 6 mL of freeze-dried OP50 (LabTie; StartLife, Netherlands) in S-Basal. Freeze-dried OP50 was made by using LabTie's protocol of 1 vial per 250 mL S-Basal. To streamline procedures for launch preparation, worms to be flown (PD55 (ccIs55 (unc-54::lacZ) V), CF1038 (daf-16 (mu86) I), CF1139 (daf-16 (mu86) I; muIs61 (daf-16::GFP)?), PJ1145 (ccIs55 (unc-54::lacZ) V; njEx38 (unc-54p::daf-2(+) + goa-1p::GFP + rol-6 (su1006))), DM2 (dim-1 (ra102) X)) were cultured in freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal in 75 cm2 cell culture flasks. Animals were cultured for a minimum of 2 weeks following transfer from plates before synchronization. During final preflight testing of the launch procedures, age synchronizations were carried out from liquid culture stocks rather than from plates to obtain 5000 L1 larvae the day before loading into bags. These cultures were left overnight in 6-well tissue culture dishes in a final volume of 500 μL freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal at 20°C. The next day, 6 mL freeze-dried OP50 was pipetted into each well before loading into flight culture bags.2.2. Validation of culture bags The experimental design for launch involved growing worms inside gas-permeable plastic bags onboard the ISS. Therefore, we tested the biocompatibility of three different bag materials: (i) polyethylene (PE) bags (1.5 inch, 250 gauge, Lay Flat Polythene Tubing; Kite Packaging Ltd., United Kingdom), (ii) Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) PE bags (Nipro, Japan), and (iii) fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) bags (Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics; TOSS GmbH, Germany). The PE bags and FEP bags are low friction and allow good gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, although gas exchange is reported to be superior in FEP to PE in bags of equal thickness (NB. all bags have previously supported C. elegans cultures in spaceflight experiments onboard the ISS). The JAXA bags are a proprietary PE blend that is no longer commercially available. To test the bags, 5000 L1 larvae were placed in the bag with OP50 before bags were heat sealed (Pacseal+ impulse heat sealer; Rajapack, United Kingdom), and then, the worms were cultured for 7 days at 20°C. After 7 days, the total worm population in each bag was counted. Three biological replicates were carried out per condition. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out in GraphPad Prism to compare the populations of worms in the three bags.2.3. Oxygen consumption rates To investigate whether diet influenced changes in oxygen consumption rates (OCR), measurements were carried out with the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), as previously described (Hewitt et al., 2018; Koopman et al., 2016). Worms were cultured in either chemically defined media [C. elegans maintenance media, CeMM (Szewczyk et al., 2003), purchased from Cell Guidance Systems custom media service, United Kingdom], or freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal. Adult animals were washed twice in incubation media [M9 buffer: 22.04 mM KH2PO4, 42.27 mM Na2HPO4, 85.56 mM NaCl (final concentrations, sterilized)] and placed in 200 μL M9-filled wells of standard Seahorse plates (20 worms/well) in 5 replicates per condition. Stable OCR measurements were taken by performing five measurement cycles for basal OCR, nine cycles for maximal OCR following the addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (10 μM final well concentration), and five cycles for nonmitochondrial OCR following the addition of sodium azide (40 nM final well concentration). OCR measurements were normalized to the number of worms per well. To obtain stable OCR measurements, the final three, seven, and two measurement cycles were used for the statistical analysis of basal, maximal, and nonmitochondrial OCR, respectively, as previously described (Hewitt et al., 2018). Differences in OCR were detected with a one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism 8 (La Jolla, CA). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.2.4. Culture volume optimization Age-synchronized L1 larvae were placed into experimental bags containing freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal (5000 L1 worms per bag). The amount of OP50 in the bag was optimized where 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 mL volumes were tested. Three biological replicates were carried out per condition.2.5. Hardware development and validation For flight, the experimental bags were to be placed into European Space Agency (ESA) experiment cassettes (ECs). As C. elegans require oxygen to develop, gas exchange between the inside of the EC and outside of the EC is required. ECs that allowed gas exchange via a gas-permeable Gortex membrane have previously been used with C. elegans onboard the ISS (Szewczyk et al., 2008); unfortunately, these were no longer available for use with MME. Therefore, we had to design (Fig. 1) and validate new ECs (Kayser Italia, Livorno, Italy). FIG. 1. Open in a new tab Hardware for the MME. Images of the hardware used for the experiment include (A) the first cage prototype and (B) the second cage prototype developed by Kayser Italia. (C) The assembly of experimental bags and cages within the EC. EC, experiment cassette; MME, Molecular Muscle Experiment. Color image is available online.To validate how well worms would grow inside the ECs, three bags each loaded with 5000 L1 worms and 6 mL freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal were cultured inside the EC for 1 week at 20°C. Once complete, the population of viable worms in the bags were counted under a dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ645; Nikon, Japan) and compared against control bags that were otherwise identical except were located outside the EC. Two different cage inserts for the ECs were designed and tested to maintain separation between the bags during the turbulent upload phase of launch, to maintain a surface area for gas exchange in flight, and to prevent the bags from freezing together at the end of the experiment. To test which cage design was best, worms were grown in bags alone, in cage design 1, and in cage design 2. Upon selection of cage design 2, further testing was carried out by growing worms in bags alone, in cage 2 alone, and in cage 2 inside an EC. Three biological replicates were carried out per condition.2.6. Validation of experimental timings As MME was to be uploaded in an active state (e.g., worms were not placed in stasis), and as launches to the ISS are often associated with delays due to inclement weather or technical problems, we needed to validate our experimental design to confirm that it could withstand launch delays. To test this, we obtained upload times from handover to installation on the ISS from NASA cold stowage for previous SpaceX launches (Table 1), as well as data for the performance of 10°C and 12°C ICE Bricks passive upload cold stowage phase change material over upload to ISS time frames. Table 1. Duration from Launch: 26 H Turnover to NASA Cold Stowage Until Installation on the International Space Station Mission Handover to installation, h SpX-4 130 SpX-5 97 SpX-6 137 SpX-8 91 SpX-9 105 SpX-10 152 SpX-11 138 SpX-12 90 SpX-13 94 SpX-14 94 Open in a new tabUsing these data, we loaded 5000 L1 larvae into 6 mL of freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal into the bags inside the full EC setup (including the cage insert) and tested various upload scenarios. Following upload scenario testing, we ran the full experiment simulating a scheduled launch, a 24 h delay, and a 48 h delay. Following these simulations, the total worm populations were counted and compared with the nominal (on-time) launch scenario. A nominal launch scenario is associated with the generation of >45,000 worms per bag, which is the requirement for postflight analysis. To determine whether our experimental design could withstand a 24 or 48 h delay, we set a matched population threshold of >45,000 worms per bag at the end of the experiment.3. Results 3.1. Evaluation and selection of culture bags Several previous spaceflight experiments have grown worms in liquid culture inside plastic experimental bags (Selch et al., 2008; Szewczyk et al., 2008; Higashitani et al., 2009); in some cases, worms were grown with an OP50 diet, in others with a CeMM diet. While it is not usual to grow C. elegans inside plastic bags on Earth, containment of liquid is a safety requirement onboard the ISS. We therefore sought to establish a plastic culture bag that would allow worm growth for MME. We evaluated three culture bags based on past use in C. elegans flight experiments. Unsurprisingly, the PE bags we selected to replicate the bags used on ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk et al., 2008) and the JAXA bags we selected to replicate the bags used on CERISE (Higashitani et al., 2009) performed well at supporting worm growth (Fig. 2). However, the FEP bags we selected to replicate bags tested on Earth (Szewczyk et al., 2003) for flight use failed to support growth, with more than half of the worms actually dying in the bags (Fig. 2). FIG. 2. Open in a new tab Growth of Caenorhabditis elegans in different plastic culture bags. Five thousand L1 larvae were loaded in standard Petri dishes, PE bags, JAXA bags, or FEP bags and cultured for 1 week at 20°C (all conditions in triplicate). Growth in PE bags was not significantly different from Petri dish controls, whereas both JAXA (**p < 0.01) and FEP (****p < 0.0001) have reduced growth compared with controls. Both PE and JAXA produce viable numbers of worms for the analysis requirements, whereas FEP do not. FEP, fluorinated ethylene propylene; JAXA, Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency; PE, polyethylene.3.2. Diet induces changes in OCR Given that past ground tests with FEP bags (Szewczyk et al., 2003) and a past flight with culture chambers utilizing FEP for gas exchange (Oczypok et al., 2012) successfully supported C. elegans growth, we wanted to understand why FEP bags did not work in our ground testing (Fig. 2). Since both past reports of use of FEP involved growing worms in CeMM rather than the OP50 diet used in MME, we were curious if the failure to grow was due to the food source. Worms grown in CeMM take longer to develop, have longer life expectancies, exhibit altered gene expression, and exhibit the characteristics of dietary restriction (Szewczyk et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2015). Given the physiological and gene expression changes in CeMM-grown worms, we hypothesized that worms grown in CeMM have differences in metabolism compared with those grown in OP50. To examine whether these different diets alter metabolism, we used the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Agilent) to measure oxygen consumption in worms grown chronically in CeMM and OP50. As shown in Fig. 3, worms grown in CeMM have significantly lower basal levels of oxygen consumption. This suggests that OP50-grown worms could have been limited for oxygen inside the FEP bags, whereas the CeMM grown worms were not. The use of CeMM rather than OP50 as a food source may therefore reduce the oxygen exchange requirement and thus increase the viability of worm experiments conducted inside plastic culture bags on the ISS. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab C. elegans grown on a bacterial diet display increased oxygen consumption compared with a chemically defined diet. Twenty adult worms grown on bacterial diet (OP50) or chemically defined diet (CeMM) were analyzed in a Seahorse XF Analyzer (n = 5 replicates per condition). In both the basal state (***p < 0.001) and in the maximal state following injection of FCCP (****p < 0.0001), oxygen consumption rates are significantly higher in OP50 compared with CeMM. **p < 0.01.

Optimizing culture volume in the flight bags Having determined that gas exchange was a limiting factor for worm growth inside plastic culture bags, we re-evaluated the surface area to volume ratio of our bags versus past flights CERISE (Higashitani et al., 2009) and ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk et al., 2008) as this ratio also influences oxygen availability for the worms within the bags. As shown in Fig. 4, the surface area to volume ratio for CERISE, which used the OP50 diet, was 8.4 cm2/mL, whereas the ratio for ICE-FIRST, which used the CeMM diet, was 10 cm2/mL. We therefore maintained the size of the bag and altered the volume of worms + OP50 feed solution, testing volumes between 3 and 10 mL. Based on CERISE, which used JAXA bags, we expected a ratio of around 8.4 cm2/mL, which equates to a little more than 7 mL of liquid culture in the bag. FIG. 4. Open in a new tab Optimization of culture volume in PE bags. (A) Volume of liquid culture and surface area to volume ratio in CERISE, ICE-FIRST, and MME. (B) Worm population size after starting with 5000 L1 worms, which were allowed to grow for 7 days at 20°C (n = 3 replicates), using different culture volumes in PE. Worm growth is optimal between 5 and 7 mL culture volume with a surface area to volume ratio in the range of 10 cm2/mL.To preserve the limited available stocks of JAXA bags and to validate materials readily available for future flights, we used PE bags instead of the JAXA bags for testing. Testing with PE bags (Fig. 4) revealed that the maximum volume in the PE culture bag should be 6–7 mL, which is roughly consistent with the past performance of the JAXA bags during CERISE. Together, these results highlight the importance of considering and testing surface area for gas exchange when designing C. elegans spaceflight experiments involving liquid cultures.3.4. Flight hardware validation The culture bags were to be held within ECs to provide an additional level of containment, thus increasing the safety of the crew as well as protecting the cultures themselves from launch and/or in-flight damage. As shown in Fig. 1, cages to contain the bags within the ECs were designed to enforce space between the culture bags during launch, ensure gas exchange, and prevent culture bags from freezing together at the end of the experiment. As shown in Fig. 5, when culture bags were used either outside or inside cage design 2, which had more space between the bags, there was no significant difference in worm growth. In contrast, cage design 1, which had less space between the bags, had significantly less growth than outside the cage. Thus, cage design 2 was adopted for MME. FIG. 5. Open in a new tab Growth of worms within prototype cages. Five hundred L1 worms were grown in culture bags for 7 days at 20°C, either within or not within a cage design (n = 3 replicates). Worm growth was lower in cage 1 compared with no cage (**p < 0.01), whereas there was no significant difference in worm growth between no cage and cage 2.Next, growth in the culture bags inside the ECs with or without the cages was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6, no significant differences in worm growth were noted for worms grown in PE culture bags outside or inside cage design 2, confirming prior testing (Fig. 5). Furthermore, there were no significant differences for worms grown in PE culture bags alone versus inside the combined cage and ECs. FIG. 6. Open in a new tab Validating growth of worms within the full experimental design. Five thousand L1 worms were grown in PE culture bags for 7 days at 20°C (n = 3 replicates). Three bags were grown without additional hardware, three bags were placed in the cage without the cassette, and three bags were placed in the complete experimental container (cage and cassette, Fig. 1). No significant differences in growth were observed.3.5. Optimizing culture conditions for upload To allow for comparison of our anticipated gene expression data with gene expression data from ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk et al., 2008) and CERISE (Higashitani et al., 2009), it was important that we time our cultures to enter adulthood following birth and development in space. As our experiment did not involve an activation step like CERISE, we conducted it as a timed upload like ICE-FIRST. However, for MME, the launch vehicle was SpaceX's Dragon and not Russia's Soyuz, and active temperature control during upload was not preferred from an operations perspective. Therefore, as SpaceX's Dragon is frequently subjected to launch delays and as phase change materials could be used to maintain temperature during upload, it was important that we test various upload scenarios to establish working timings for upload to the ISS such that the worms were at an appropriate developmental stage, population density, and had not run out of food. As shown in Table 2, we started testing with fixed temperature of a duration calculated to allow P0 animals to grow to adulthood during upload (days 1–3/4) and the F1 generation to grow to mid-adulthood after living only in the spaceflight environment (days 3–8). We found that this duration exhausted our food source as evidenced by lack of visible food and presence of Dauer larvae. Reducing growth by 1 day resulted in viable worms of sufficient numbers for analysis (Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 6). Table 2. Operation Scenarios Tested Duration Temperature profile Outcome 8 Days 20°C Not viable, ran out of food 7 Days 20°C Viable, no Dauer larvae 1 Day 12°C Viable +6.5 Days 20°C 8 Days 12°C Some tests ran out of food around day 5.5 at 20°C +6.5 Days 20°C 3 Days 12°C Viable +6 Days 20°C 8 Days 12°C Viable, food close to exhaustion +6 Days 20°C 8 Days NASA 12°C phase change Ran out of food around day 5 at 20°C +6 Days 20°C 8 Days NASA 10°C phase change Viable +6 Days 20°C 5 Days NASA 10°C phase change Viable +6 Days 20°C Open in a new tabUnfortunately, with a maximum possible late turnover of payload at launch of—24 h, 3 days from turnover until installation in an incubator onboard the ISS was not a realistic timeline to produce viable animal cultures. Thus, for the timelines/late handover scenario associated with a Dragon launch scenario, similar to ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk et al., 2008), we would require active temperature control throughout upload. We therefore moved on to test other scenarios that were, from an operations perspective, preferred. We next tested the effect of cold incubation during the prelaunch (1 day) or prelaunch plus longest reported cold stowage upload via Dragon (Table 2, 8 days). For these tests, we also reduced the time of culturing at 20°C by half a day as we anticipated some level of development to occur while at 12°C. As shown in Table 2, chilling of the cultures for the day between handover and launch allowed for viable cultures, subjected to the same operational issues as when culturing at 20°C, whereas 8 days of chilling the cultures did not allow for all cultures tested to be viable. We therefore tested short cold stowage upload (1 day handover to launch with 2 days from launch to the ISS) and longest reported cold stowage upload via Dragon (8 days) with a further half-day reduction in the time of culturing at 20°C. As shown in Table 2, both short and long cold stowage followed by 6 days of incubation produced viable cultures. These results suggested that even the longest duration cold stowage followed by a period of incubation onboard the ISS would be a suitable operational solution for MME. As passive rather than active temperature control was preferred for upload operations, we tested the effect of passive cold stowage using NASA's phase change materials. Given that 12°C active temperature control during upload produced viable cultures, we first tested NASA's 12°C phase change materials temperature profile during long upload. As shown in Table 2, long cold stowage when using NASA's 12°C phase change materials temperature profile did not produce viable cultures, with worms running out of food about 1 day before the end of the incubation at 20°C. This result may appear surprising; however, the phase change material starts at 10°C and ramps up to 14°C over the period of cold stowage. Thus, from an engineering perspective, the 12°C phase change materials do indeed maintain 12°C ± 2°C, but from a biological perspective, this is quite different from the 12°C ± 0.5°C achieved via active temperature control. Confirming that 10°C phase change materials also maintain within +/−2°C, we tested long cold stowage using NASA's 10°C phase change materials temperature profile, which did produce viable cultures (Table 2). Having confirmed a viable passive stowage upload scenario for MME, we finally tested the impact of a short upload scenario with the 10°C phase change materials (1 day turnover to launch, 3 days to station, 1 day to put in incubator) and found that this also produced viable cultures (Table 2). Thus, through various iterations of testing that included what we might do to culture worms in our own laboratory, to implementing operational restrictions imposed by launch and upload to the ISS coupled with a better understanding of passive cold stowage performance, we were able to achieve a viable experimental protocol. Importantly, the data from this testing also inform of the ability of the experimental protocol to perform in other, off-nominal scenarios.3.6. Validation of launch procedures, upload timings, and simulated incubation on the ISS Having finalized an operationally acceptable upload scenario, we prepared for flight. First, to help increase the visibility of our outreach efforts (Gaffney et al., 2018b), we developed and finalized a mission logo (Fig. 7). This was distributed to ∼2000 members of the public, mainly school children, between final ground testing and launch and created a “brand” for our experiment that was used by the UK government and media, which reached an estimated 41 million people. FIG. 7. Open in a new tab MME mission logo.Second, in consultation with ESA, we agreed a nominal launch scenario to be used in our final testing (Fig. 8A) as well as to assess the impact of a 24- and 48-h launch delay on our finalized experimental timeline. Note that a notional period of time (7 days) was used to simulate time in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) before download of the samples back to Earth. As shown in Fig. 8B, cultures from the nominal and both launch delay scenarios grew as expected. FIG. 8. Open in a new tab Final experimental timeline verification test.

One-way ANOVA is not significant between the three groups. ANOVA, analysis of variance.4. Discussion The desired culture bag and EC hardware used in the past were not available for use with MME. Therefore, what should have been a straightforward repurposing of previously flown hardware became a program of work to redesign and revalidate flight hardware. This entailed dealing with the frequent challenges of successfully designing and flying an experiment to the ISS: use and validation of nonstandard laboratory hardware and validation of experimental timings for upload of biologically active experiments to the ISS. We evaluated three culture bags based on past use in C. elegans flight experiments. Unsurprisingly, two of the bags selected to replicate bags used in previous flight performed well. However, one of the bags selected, made of FEP, was not compatible with worm growth despite having previously been used. This result was particularly striking as FEP is reported to have better gas exchange properties than PE and is why FEP bags are used to fly cell culture experiments (Vassy et al., 2001). Upon closer inspection of the specifications of the PE and FEP bags, it was clear that the PE bags were half as thick as the FEP bags and therefore performed better as a gas exchange surface despite worse performance as a material. As both PE and FEP bags are nonstandard equipment for growing C. elegans, these findings highlight the importance of properly testing proposed flight hardware before flight, as selecting FEP bags for better gas exchange and ease of use properties (e.g., the capacity to load animals into bags via injection ports) was the operational preference before testing. Having uncovered that gas exchange did appear to be a concern for growing worms in plastic bags, we tested if culture volume to gas exchange surface area impacted culture growth. Unsurprisingly, we found that it did, which enabled us to optimize culture volume for MME, something not done for ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk et al., 2008). We also examined worm oxygen consumption using the diet from ICE-FIRST, CeMM (Szewczyk et al., 2008), and the diet from CERISE, OP50 (Higashitani et al., 2009). Consistent with the biological changes for worms grown in CeMM (Szewczyk et al., 2003, 2006), we found that the worms consumed less oxygen. Collectively, our results suggest that growing worms in plastic culture bags does pose a challenge to worm experiment viability. The use of CeMM rather than OP50 as a food source may therefore reduce the oxygen exchange requirement and thus increase the viability of worm experiments conducted inside plastic culture bags on the ISS, but this comes with the added challenge that CeMM is more prone to become contaminated. Regardless, it remains clear that proper ground testing is required preflight despite past successful C. elegans spaceflight experiments. Additionally, in contrast to challenges with experimental bags and gas exchange, the development of new ECs, similarly dependent on effective surface area to volume ratios, presented no problems. Gas exchange in the ECs was capable of producing a viable experiment. This result suggests that for future experiments it is likely that gas exchange between the C. elegans culture and ISS will be limited principally by the exchange properties of the culture bags and not the ECs. The second most challenging portion of our preflight testing was testing and finalizing suitable scenarios for upload to the ISS that were consistent both with current operational realities and with successfully conducting our experiment. The data on durations from payload handover until integration on the ISS provided us with a realistic range of upload timings and should prove useful for others planning to upload via Dragon with NASA cold stowage. Using these timings, we were able to establish that a C. elegans payload can be kept in a stasis during cold upload at 8–12°C, then subsequently grow and reproduce effectively. Of note, while the use of phase change material removed the need for active temperature control during upload, it was critical that we tested the performance of the phase change material temperature profile. Indeed, for biologically active cultures, phase change material provides a significantly different temperature profile than active temperature control.5. Conclusion In conclusion, we have updated the flight hardware and upload conditions available to support C. elegans experiments onboard the ISS. These validations provide a platform for MME and future investigators to successfully, and efficiently, conduct experiments onboard the ISS.Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the UK Space Agency, ESA, JAXA, and BIOTESC for their support of the Molecular Muscle Experiment.Abbreviations Used CeMM C. elegans maintenance media ECs experiment cassettes ESA European Space Agency FEP fluorinated ethylene propylene ISS International Space Station JAXA Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency MELFI Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS MME Molecular Muscle Experiment OCR oxygen consumption rates PE polyethylene Author Disclosure Statement No competing financial interests exist.Funding Information This work was supported by the BBSRC (Grant Nos.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aging and healthspan are determined by both environmental and genetic factors. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Specifically, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual benefits for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneficial effects on aging in C. elegans. We found that TCE supplementation at 6 μg or 12 μg/mL, increased (p < 0.05) the mean lifespan of wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. Consistent with these findings, TCE upregulated (p < 0.05) expression of longevity-related genes such as daf-16 and aak-2 (but not daf-2 or akt-1 genes) and genes related to oxidative stress such as sod-2. Further, we showed that TCE supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not change the mean lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TCE confers healthspan benefits in C. elegans through enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress, mainly via the DAF-16 pathway. Keywords: C. elegans, tart cherry, lifespan, aging, oxidative stress, daf-16",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Aging has a significant influence on economy, health, and demography with healthy aging being a global challenge [1]. In 2018, ~16% of the United States population were 65 years old or over and expected to reach 23% by 2060 [2]. Globally, 9% of the population was old (over age 65) in 2019, which is expected to increase to 16% by 2050 [3]. Genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to aging and healthy lifespan. The effects of aging could be altered, and progression of aging could be slowed down [4]. Various factors contribute to aging such as defects in development and genetics, environmental factors, diseases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause harmful changes in cells and tissues [5]. Excessive ROS production causes oxidative stress, which is a predominant factor in the pathophysiology of various diseases and aging in human and other models [6] such as Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) [7] and Drosophila [8]. Calorie restriction is the most established method for successfully extending lifespan of animals and model organisms such as C. elegans [9,10,11]. However, human studies are scarce [12], and the safety and effectiveness of calorie restriction for lifespan extension in humans is controversial [1]. Therefore, it is critical to identify dietary bioactive compounds that reduce ROS levels and thereby delay aging. Among the pathways and genes involved in lifespan regulation, DAF-16 is homologous to mammalian forkhead box O1 (FOXO) transcription factor, and a key lifespan extension transcription factor that is highly conserved across a variety of organisms such as flies, worms, rodents, and humans [12,13]. C. elegans DAF-2 signaling, which is orthologous to insulin and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in mammals, is also involved in metabolism and longevity but is negatively regulated by DAF-16/FOXO signaling [14]. Additionally, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a conserved energy sensor in cells, extends lifespan of C. elegans [15]. In addition to these major pathways and genes, ROS is also involved in regulating longevity [16]. High ROS activity has been shown to be a major lifespan limiting factor in humans, C. elegans, and Drosophila [7,17,18,19]. Finally, in addition to the factors discussed above, mitochondria regulate different signaling and metabolic pathways, including ROS production and therefore plays a vital role in aging progression [20]. Dietary intervention is one of the effective non-genetic or pharmacological means to combat aging [21]. Botanicals like cranberry, strawberry, blueberry, sweet cherry, tart cherry, and curcumin all contain biologically active polyphenols, which may protect against diseases and promote health in animals, humans, and model organisms [22,23,24]. Moreover, cranberry [8,13,25], mulberry [26], and blueberry anthocyanins increase lifespan of C. elegans and Drosophila via different pathways [17,27,28]. Out of these, Montmorency tart cherry (Prunus cerasus) contains high concentration of anthocyanin flavonoids, and its consumption is known to provide numerous health benefits by reducing inflammation and production of ROS [29,30] as well as protecting against diabetes [31], cardiovascular diseases [32], muscle pain [33], and cancer [34]. Tart cherry (TC) possess increased antioxidant activity both in vivo and in vitro [35]. However, the mechanisms by which TC reverses effects of aging through antioxidant activities have not been studied yet and remain to be further elucidated. To investigate the effects of TC extract (TCE) on aging and healthspan, we used the nematode C. elegans, which is an excellent model for aging research [36] because of its short lifespan (2–3 weeks), experimental flexibility, and rapid turnover [37]. Furthermore, C. elegans behavior and physiological activities slow down with age similar to that of higher mammals, including humans [27]. Additionally, 83% of C. elegans proteome shows homology to the human proteome, and both humans and nematodes share significant age-related characteristics that can be used to study effects on health and aging [21,38]. In this paper, we determined mechanisms by which TCE extends lifespan in C. elegans using microfluidic devices for whole-life culture studies that allow efficient drug delivery compared to animals reared on agar-plates [39,40,41]. We demonstrated that TCE extends lifespan and healthspan of C. elegans by influencing the major DAF-16/FOXO lifespan regulating pathway. Consistent with this finding, TCE regulated upstream and downstream genes related to DAF-16 pathway, reduced the activity of genes related to ROS, and increased oxygen consumption rate. Therefore, our findings reveal protective anti-aging effects of TCE in vivo with robust translational potential in humans due to the feasibility of incorporating TCE into a typical human diet.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Preparation of Tart Cherry (TC) Extract Frozen TC (Cherry Marketing Institute, Dewitt, MI, USA) was ground using motor and pestle to obtain TC extract (TCE). Extracted cherry juice was filtered using 0.22 µm filter and stored in −80 °C until further use. Amounts of TCE used are based on anthocyanin concentration. We used TCE with doses between 0–12 µg anthocyanin per mL media. TCE extract from frozen TC contains 533 ± 47 µg/g total anthocyanin [29], and 1 µL TCE contains 3 µg of anthocyanins as measured by high performance liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (HPLC-MS) [35,42,43]. Additionally, TCE contains other phenolics, melatonin, vitamins A/C/E/K, niacin, beta carotene, lutein + zeaxanthin, and pantothenic acid [29,44]. To prevent oxidation, thermal degradation, chemical and biochemical changes, extracted TC was aliquoted (20 µL) and stored in −80 °C [45]. Aliquots of TCE were thawed only once and not refrozen, and TCE was replaced every day to prevent oxidation [45]. 2.2. Strains and Growth Conditions Worms (wild type N2, daf-16, aak-2) (Vanapalli lab, TTU, Lubbock, TX, USA) were maintained on solid nematode growth medium for two successive generations, as previously described [46]. On the third day, age-synchronized young adults were used for analyses. 2.3. Lifespan Assay At day 3, individual worms were suspended in liquid buffer (Nematode Growth Media (NGM)) and loaded into the micropillar chambers of a NemaLife microfluidic device using a syringe [40,41]. Each microfluidic device contained 30 individual chambers for animals to crawl, and one worm was loaded per chamber. Chambers were washed everyday with NGM to avoid progenies. Adult worms were fed with concentrated bacteria (100 mg/mL OP50) mixed with 3, 6, and 12 μg/mL TCE in the final mixture every day starting at day three until they all died. Chambers were rinsed everyday using liquid NGM media to wash out worm progenies and food was replenished. Worms were scored for survival every day. Worms killed during manipulation, wash errors, and bagging of worms exposed to contamination events were subsequently censored from analyses. At least three independent trials were performed for all conditions. Lifespan analyses were carried out using Kaplan–Meier statistical function using GraphPad Prism Version 7.04 software, with statistical significance considered at p < 0.05 using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. 2.4. Gene Expression Analyses Age synchronized worms ~500 µL was added into 60 mm plates. We estimated that each plate had approximately same number of worms ~1000 for RNA isolation. These N2 worms were grown in 3 mL of liquid axenic media for 7 days and then treated with or without tart cherry (6 µg/mL media, 12 µg/mL media) for 3 days, after which RNA was isolated using RNA isolation kit (Zymo Research Corp, Irvine, CA, USA) following manufacturers protocol. Same amount of total RNA was transcribed into cDNA using Maxima Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, CA, USA). Maxima powerup SYBRTM Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, CA, USA) was used for making cDNA to test targeted genes including daf-16, daf-2, daf-18, aak-2, akt-1, lin-14, skn-1, ucp-4, sod-2/3 with 18s housekeeping gene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). 2.5. Mitochondrial Respiration Analysis To investigate TC-mediated changes in mitochondrial function, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements were performed using the Seahorse XFe24 analyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Three days treated adult wild-type worms were washed twice in M9 buffer [47] and transferred into M9-filled wells (20 worms/well) in replicates of 4 per condition (i.e., 4 wells per strain). The experiment was repeated three times (n = 3) using the same conditions. To generate stable OCR measurements, 5 measurement cycles were performed for basal OCR, 9 cycles for maximal OCR following the addition of FCCP (10 μM final well concentration), and 5 cycles for non-mitochondrial OCR following the addition of sodium azide (40 mM final well concentration). OCR measurements were normalized to the number of worms per well. To avoid unstable OCR measurements, the final 3, 7, and 2 measurement cycles were used for the statistical analysis of basal, maximal, and non-mitochondrial OCR, respectively. 2.6. Statistical Analysis Differences in gene expression and OCR were detected with a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism 7.04, with statistical significance considered at p < 0.05.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Tart Cherry Extends Mean Lifespan of Wild Type N2 C. elegans in a Dose-Dependent Manner Under these conditions, wild type (WT) worms had a mean lifespan (MLS) of 13.31 ± 0.61 days. The MLS of worms treated with TCE at concentrations of 3, 6, and 12 μg/mL were 14.92 ± 0.58, 16.83 ± 0.77, and 16.73 ± 0.67 days, respectively. While there was no difference with 3 μg/mL, both 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE significantly (p < 0.01) increased lifespan by 26.44% and 25.69%, respectively (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S1), compared to no TCE treatment. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Tart cherry extract (TCE) extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Treatment with 6 µg/mL (pink) and 12 µg/mL (purple) TCE increased mean lifespan (MLS) in wild type (N2) C. elegans (p < 0.05) by 16.83 ± 0.77 and 16.73 ± 0.67 days, respectively compared to control or no treatment (0 µg/mL, MLS 13.31 ± 0.61 days, black) or 3 µg/mL TCE (blue, MLS: 14.92 ± 0.58 days) grown at 20 °C. Each lifespan experiment was repeated at least three independent times with similar results. 3.2. Tart Cherry Effects on Genes Related to Aging To identify molecular mechanism(s) involved in promoting lifespan by TCE, we selected 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE that extended mean lifespan of WT worms in data discussed above. Using qRT-PCR, we evaluated the mRNA levels of daf-2, age-1 ortholog of human phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, and daf-16 genes in WT worms treated with 6 and 12 µg/mL TCE. Both 6 and 12 µg/mL TCE decreased mRNA expression of daf-2 (Figure 2a) and increased mRNA expression of daf-16 (Figure 2b). However, age-1 gene, downstream target of insulin/insulin like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS), had very low expression (data not shown due to low expression levels). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Effects of tart cherry extracts (TCE) on mRNA levels of (a) daf-2, (b) daf-16, (c) daf-18, (d) akt-1, (e) lin-14, (f) skn-1, (g) ucp-4, (h) sod-2, (i) sod-3, and (j) aak-2. mRNA expression of daf-2, daf-16, daf-18, skn-1, ucp-4, sod-2, aak-2 was significantly different with 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE worms compared to not treated (0 μg/mL) worms (different letters (a, b) are significantly different, p < 0.05, One-way ANOVA, n = 5, five independent experiments with triplicates). There is no significant difference in the mRNA levels of akt, lin-14 and sod-3 in the 6 and 12 μg/mL treated worms compared to not treated worms (0 μg/mL). Synchronized worms (approx. n ~ 1000) grown in the axenic media were treated with 0, 6, and 12 μg/mL TCE, and gene expression analysis was performed at day 10 after 3 days of treatment.Moreover, we measured the mRNA levels of daf-18 gene (Figure 2c), a human phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene ortholog, which downregulates DAF-2 receptor pathway by inhibiting the activity of AGE-1 [48]. Here, we observed that daf-18 was upregulated significantly by 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE, which may also be involved in down regulating IIS signaling and promoting DAF-16 nuclear localization [49]. Additionally, we measured two upstream DAF-16 inhibitors, serine-threonine protein kinase (akt-1) (Figure 2d) and lin-14 (Figure 2e) and did not find any changes in expression levels of these genes following TCE treatment. This suggests that upregulation of upstream daf-18 gene may inhibit the expression of akt-1 and lin-14. As antioxidant status and mitochondrial function are also important in aging, we measured the mRNA levels of markers involved in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis. Specifically, we measured levels of (i) SKiNhead (SKN-1), homolog to mammalian nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2); (ii) uncoupling protein-4 (UCP-4), mitochondrial uncoupling protein; (iii) SOD-2/3, a superoxide dismutase controlling ROS production; and (iv) aak-2, an AMP-activated protein kinase homolog known to directly regulate daf-16 activity. Data in Figure 2 illustrate changes in expression of these genes following TCE treatment as shown by mRNA levels of skn-1 (Figure 2f), ucp-4 (Figure 2g), sod-2 (Figure 2h), and aak-2 (Figure 2j), all of which were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the worms treated with 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE, compared to worms with no TCE treatments. By contrast, no differences were observed in mRNA levels for sod-3 (Figure 2i) with TCE treatment at either dose tested. Collectively, our results indicate that TCE acts through the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathways by directly or indirectly influencing the activities of the DAF-16 transcription factor. 3.3. Effects of TCE on C. elegans Respiration As few mitochondrial genes are changed by TCE, we next assessed changes in mitochondrial function/respiration by TCE in C. elegans, using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux analyzer, (Figure 3). Only spare respiration, which reflects “the ability of an organism to respond to increasing energy demands” [50] was significantly higher in 6 and 12 μg/mL treated worms compared to non-treated (0 μg/mL) and 3 μg/mL TCE treated worms (Figure 3a). There were no differences observed in maximum (Figure 3b), mitochondrial (Figure 3c), or non-mitochondrial (Figure 3d) respiration. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Effects of tart cherry extracts (TCE) on respiration capacity in C. elegans. WT worms were treated with 0, 3, 6, and 12 μg/mL TCE. Sea-horse analysis was used to measure how they utilize oxygen. (a) Spare respiration was significantly higher (different letters (a, b) are significantly different, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, 20 worms/well in 4 replicates, n = 3 independent experiments) in 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE treated worms compared to 0 and 3 μg/mL treated worms. No difference was observed in (b) maximum respiration, (c) non-mitochondrial, or (d) mitochondrial respiration in TCE treated worms compared to non-treated worms. 3.4. TCE Did Not Extend Mean Lifespan in Daf-16 and Aak-2 Mutant Worms Because daf-16 mRNA expression was significantly increased by TCE, we tested whether daf-16 mutant worms were responsive to the same concentration of TCE used for WT worms to further validate the specific pathways involved in TCE-mediated lifespan extension. None of the TCE concentrations used (3, 6, and 12 μg/mL) significantly changed the MLS of daf-16 mutant worms (Figure 4a and Supplementary Table S2), which support our initial finding that lifespan extension by TCE is dependent on IIS/DAF-16 pathway. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Tart cherry extract (TCE) did not extend lifespan in daf-16 and aak-2 mutant C. elegans. (a) Treatments with 3 µg/mL (blue), 6 µg/mL (pink), and 12 µg/mL (purple). TCE had mean lifespans (MLS) of 12.65 ± 0.43, 13.96 ± 0.51, and 14.29 ± 0.74, respectively in daf-16 mutant C. elegans compared to control or no treatment (0 µg/mL, MLS 13.57 ± 0.51, black) grown at 20 °C. (b) Treatments with 3 µg/mL (blue, MLS: 14.83 ± 0.15), 6 µg/mL (pink, MLS: 14.41 ± 0.18), and 12 µg/mL (purple, MLS: 15.64 ± 0.83) TCE did not increase MLS in aak-2 mutant C. elegans, compared to control or no treatment (0 µg/mL, MLS: 15.68 ± 0.20, black) grown at 20 °C. Each lifespan experiment was repeated at least three independent times with similar results. Statistical significance considered at p < 0.05 using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.Moreover, since TCE significantly increased mRNA expression of aak-2 in WT worms, and published research showed that both DAF-16 and AAK-2 are involved in regulating longevity [51], we next tested involvement of AAK-2 signaling in lifespan. Interestingly, TCE (3, 6, and 12 μg/mL) did not increase the MLS of aak-2 mutant worms (Figure 4b and Supplementary Table S3), indicating importance of this pathway in TCE mediated longevity effects.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion Studies have observed that bioactive compounds from various botanicals offer a variety of health benefits against obesity, cancer, inflammation, and age-related functional decline [23,35,52,53]. Here, we showed that Montmorency Tart Cherry is a potentially effective nutraceutical for promoting healthy aging in C. elegans. We showed that TCE consumption substantially extends lifespan mainly through IIS and DAF-16 signaling. We further confirmed these findings in mutant worms lacking functional daf-16 and aak-2 genes. TCE treatment did not extend the lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. 4.1. TCE Increases Lifespan through IIS and DAF-16 Pathway In this study we used 3, 6, and 12 µg/mL of TCE to investigate its longevity effects in C. elegans. Previous studies from our lab have shown that TC increased cell survival and antioxidant activity in vitro using adipocytes [35]. Moreover, TC reduced toxic levels of ROS in both adipocytes and Zucker fatty rats [35]. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have documented lifespan effects of TCE in mammalian and only one study has showed TCE effects in model organisms [54]. Some studies have shown that TC improves memory, autophagy, and hippocampal inflammation in aged rats [52] and protects against age-related bone loss in mice [55]. Studies in C. elegans with blueberries (50, 100, and 200 mg/mL of extract) demonstrated increased MLS by 22.2%, 36.5%, and 44.4% [27] and 5 mg/mL of blueberry extracts extended MLS of Drosophila by 10% [17]. Similarly, cranberry extracts (2 mg/mL) increased MLS of C. elegans by 32.5% [13] and 20 mg/mL cranberry extracts extended MLS of Drosophila by 10% [8]; purple wheat anthocyanins (100 μg/mL) increased MLS of C. elegans by 10.5% [56]. In our study, we found that feeding C. elegans lower concentrations of TCE (3, 6, and 12 μg/mL) resulted in significant extension of MLS by 12.09% (p > 0.05), 26.44% (p < 0.05), and 25.69% (p < 0.05), respectively. These results are comparable to findings from the studies outlined above using other plant or fruit extracts [13,27,56]. However, previous studies in C. elegans were done on agar plates, which require typically very high doses to get enough drug into the worms, as the drug can diffuse into the agar, and drug delivery is not efficient. Our cultures are in liquid environment due to microfluidics (NemaLife), which is a novel approach to culture worms with several advantages: worms can crawl in an optimized micropillar arena in liquid (unlike in agar plates) that improves drug delivery; during maintenance, sieve channels dispersed progeny, thus avoiding loss of adults; they can feed the adult-only population [41]. Consistent with the advantages mentioned above, observation of lifespan-extension with low doses of TCE suggests that the microfluidic environments are efficient at drug delivery compared to agar plates. IIS pathway modulates aging and longevity and highly conserved in invertebrates and mammals. Insulin like peptide (ILPs), an insulin/IGF-1 receptor (DAF-2), serine/threonine kinase (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 (PDK-1), AKT-1/2, AGE-1)/PI3K and FOXO transcription factor (DAF-16) are major components of the IIS transduction cascades [49]. Inactivation of DAF-16 transcription factor occurs after binding of ILPs to DAF-2, inhibiting the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 [57], which negatively regulates longevity. In addition to IIS signaling, many signaling pathways such as TOR, AMPK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways are involved in aging [49,58]. Inhibition of TOR signaling increases lifespan of C. elegans and Drosophila via DAF-16 [8,59], CaMKII targets DAF-16 and modulates lifespan when worms are exposed to heat, hunger, or some other form of stressors [58], and JNK-1 signaling also regulates the activity of DAF-16 to promote lifespan post transcriptionally [60]. Very limited studies have tested effects of bioactive compounds in worms. Supplementation with wild blueberry juice (50, 100, and 200 mg/mL) increased C. elegans lifespan through CaMKII pathway that mediates osmotic stress resistance [28]. Other studies using fresh blueberry (200 μg/mL) also showed increased lifespan and stress tolerance through DAF-16 [27], cranberry extract (2 mg/mL) [25] and anthocyanin-rich purple wheat extract (100 μg/mL) [56] increased lifespan in C. elegans via the IIS/DAF-16 signaling pathway [13,25,56]. Further studies showed that oleanolic acid increased lifespan and stress tolerance through DAF-16 [61] while resveratrol, found in grape berry skin (100 μM), increased lifespan in C. elegans through sirtuin 2.1 (SIR 2.1), mammalian NAD-dependent protein deacetylase homology [62]. Moreover, blackberry extract increased antioxidant capacity in worms and provided protection against ROS generation [63]. In addition, a recently published study revealed that TCE acts as a calorie restriction mimetic and increased lifespan in C. elegans [54]. Our findings showed that TCE regulates many components in IIS pathway to influence lifespan. TCE did not increase lifespan in daf-16 mutant C. elegans, indicating that TCE may regulate lifespan through DAF-16. Further analysis of genes in WT worms also confirmed that TCE regulates lifespan mainly via DAF-16/IIS pathway, evident by significantly reduced expression of daf-2 and increased expression of daf-16 genes. Since both DAF-2 and DAF-16 in IIS pathway are highly conserved, our findings reveal the significant potential of TCE to promote healthy aging in humans. Although we did not see any changes of akt-1 and lin-14, two inhibitors of DAF-16, at mRNA levels, there are many other upstream pathways and downstream targets that we did not test. Thus, it is possible that TCE regulates upstream molecular targets of akt and lin-14, which merit further investigation, including those that control the expression of these genes such as pdk-1 and lin-4. SKN-1 is another transcription factor, which acts downstream of IIS pathway and showed reduced expression with reduced IIS signaling [64]. We found that skn-1 gene expression was also upregulated by TCE treatments in WT worms. Our results are consistent with a recently published study using Hibiscus sabdariffa L. extracts which increased SKN-1 activity and prolonged lifespan in C. elegans [65]. Studies have shown that cherries including sour cherry possess antimicrobial activity [66]. We performed all our gene expression data in liquid CMEM media without bacteria supplementation and still observed increased expression of lifespan-related genes. However, in our current study, we did not measure anti-microbial activity of TCE on the OP50 bacteria which might account for part of calorie restriction-like effects on C. elegans to increase lifespan. Therefore, these findings must be validated in future in lifespan assays. 4.2. Involvement of AMPK/AAK-2 in Lifespan Determination Interestingly, TCE did not increase the MLS of aak-2 mutant worms, indicating importance of this pathway in TCE-mediated longevity effects. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a fuel-sensing enzyme that negatively regulates fatty acid synthesis and positively regulates energy production pathways such as glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation [57]. Activation of AAK-2, homolog of AMPK in C. elegans physiologically (dietary restriction) or pharmacologically (resveratrol or metformin), increased lifespan of C. elegans [67]. C. elegans has both aak-1 and aak-2, two different genes. The AMPKα1 subunit in C. elegans, AAK-2, is activated by AMP and involved in longevity [51]. By contrast, AMPKα2 subunit, AAK-2, in C. elegans is not involved in longevity effects suggesting that AAK-2 is the subunit with kinase activity [67]. Because of that, here, we evaluated the effects of TCE in aak-2 worm lifespan and aak-2 gene expression in WT worms. TCE did not change the MLS of aak-2 worms treated with TCE. Previous studies reported that aak-2 (ok524) mutants have a shorter lifespan (12%) than WT worms [51]. In contrast to these findings, however, aak-2 (rb754) mutant worms we used for our lifespan assays did not show shorter average lifespan than WT worms, and aak-2 (rb754) had 17.8% increased lifespan than WT worms. The above reported study has been conducted on agar plates, while we used microfluidic devices for the lifespan assay and fed worms everyday with liquid OP50 mixed with TCE. Changes of the environment, use of microfluidic devices, and differences in the aak-2 strains used might be a potential cause for these discrepancies. Further genetic analysis in WT worms showed increased expression of aak-2 gene with TCE treatments. Possibly, activation of aak-2 increased fatty acid oxidation in WT worms, which may change total fatty acid composition in the worms and indirectly influence the lifespan of WT worms. However, these changes were not taking place in mutant aak2, which may affect their responses to TCE and changes in fatty acid composition or lipid metabolism. These findings suggest that TCE acts partly through AAK-2 pathway and requires DAF-16 and IIS pathways to increase lifespan in C. elegans. Sirtuins-1 (Sirt-1), an ortholog of mammalian yeast deacetylase Sir-2 linked to IIS signaling pathway [12], may also be involved in lifespan regulation and merits further investigation. 4.3. Role of Mitochondria in Lifespan Determination Mitochondria plays an important role in overall cellular and organism health. Mitochondria are involved in cellular metabolism, apoptosis, and production of ROS [60]. It is thought that impaired mitochondria produce more ROS which causes cellular damage and leads to aging [68,69]. SOD is an enzyme that is involved in detoxification [16,70] and is found in cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria [71]. Experiments in yeast and mice showed that knocking out sod-1 and sod-2 decreased lifespan [72,73]. In contrast, another study reported that SOD has no effect on lifespan in C. elegans [16]. In our current study, sod-2 gene levels were increased with TCE, with no changes in sod-3 gene expression. Another study using purple pitanga fruit showed increased sod-3 protein expression in C. elegans [19]. We chose sod-3 over sod-1 as they share some genetic similarities and have a certain level of amino acid homology, and sod-2 does not share substantial amino acid homology with either sod-1 or sod-3 [74]. Possibly, increased sod-2 gene expression in our study decreased mitochondrial ROS activity and extended lifespan. However, these findings remain to be confirmed using sod-2 mutant worms. Furthermore, to validate effects of TCE on ROS production, we plan in future to conduct additional functional assays to measure ROS, GSH/SG, and MDA levels. Ideal mitochondrial function is critical to have healthy cellular activity, and mitochondrial respiration is a strong indicator of good mitochondrial function [75]. An age-related decline in oxidative phosphorylation can relate to reduced mitochondrial and nuclear expressed peptides functioning in the electron transport chain (ETC) [76]. Mitochondrial health can be measured by the rate of mitochondrial respiration in ETC [77,78]. Moreover, alterations in the oxygen consumption rate are an indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction [79]. Moreover, decreased mitochondrial function reduces sufficient energy production, which plays key role during aging [80]. In order to quantify the function of mitochondria, we assessed mitochondrial OCR by TCE treatments in WT C. elegans. Our data showed that TCE treated adult worms have significantly higher spare respiration capacity with 6 and 12 μg/mL concentrations. Spare respiratory capacity is the amount of additional ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation as a result of sudden increase in energy demand [76]. Based on our findings, it is possible that increased expression of antioxidant genes, led to increased mitochondrial spare respiration by reducing ROS production and oxidative stress in part through sod-2. Another indicator of mitochondrial function is uncoupling proteins (UCPs). C. elegans expresses ucp-4. UCPs are highly conserved in many species, such as invertebrates, plants, and mammals. UCP-1 in mammals is induced by cold temperature and is a major player in thermogenesis and energy expenditure [81]. Mammals express several other UCPs, which are involved in different functions other than thermogenesis. It is reported that non-thermogenic UCPs protect cells against oxidative stress [82]. In support of these ideas, knocking down ucp-2 gene in mice generated more ROS than WT mice [83], and knocking down ucp-3 gene led to more ROS production in skeletal muscle [84]. UCP-like protein in C. elegans is thoroughly related to ucp-4 in mammals, and the two proteins share 46% sequence identity [85]. Here, we found that expression of ucp-4 was significantly higher in worms treated with 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE. Several studies documented that ucp-4 mutants may be involved in increased neuronal defects during aging [68,86], but none of the studies have reported lifespan extension effects of ucp-4 by reducing mitochondrial ROS production. Our findings suggest that reduced ROS production and increased mitochondrial function by TCE may be governed partially by increased ucp-4 expression.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions In conclusion, we have shown that TCE increases lifespan of C. elegans, in a DAF-16-dependent manner. This may be mainly due to genetic regulation in IIS and DAF-16 pathway, partial involvement of AAK-2 signaling, increased antioxidant activity, and spare respiratory activity, allowing cells to function better under stressful conditions. Major underlying molecular targets are summarized in Figure 5, some of which require additional validations. Further studies are warranted to understand mechanisms linking oxidative stress, respiration, and longevity and their regulation by dietary antioxidants such as tart cherry anthocyanins. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Major molecular targets for TCE in C. elegans. TCE downregulated daf-2 gene and up-regulated daf-16, daf-18, skn-1, sod-2, ucp-4, and aak-2 while no changes were observed in akt-1 or lin-14 genes. These molecules may be indirectly involved in regulating mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, ant-oxidant activity, and fatty acid metabolism, and this may subsequently increase lifespan of C. elegans. Downregulated genes are shown in red; up-regulated genes are shown in blue, and those genes that were not changed by TCE are shown in green. Dotted arrows show potential indirect targets of TCE.",

Copyright notice ID: 7285199 PMID: 32443669 Abstract Aging and healthspan are determined by both environmental and genetic factors. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Specifically, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual benefits for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneficial effects on aging in C. elegans. We found that TCE supplementation at 6 μg or 12 μg/mL, increased (p < 0.05) the mean lifespan of wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. Consistent with these findings, TCE upregulated (p < 0.05) expression of longevity-related genes such as daf-16 and aak-2 (but not daf-2 or akt-1 genes) and genes related to oxidative stress such as sod-2. Further, we showed that TCE supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not change the mean lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TCE confers healthspan benefits in C. elegans through enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress, mainly via the DAF-16 pathway. Keywords: C. elegans, tart cherry, lifespan, aging, oxidative stress, daf-161. Introduction Aging has a significant influence on economy, health, and demography with healthy aging being a global challenge [1]. In 2018, ~16% of the United States population were 65 years old or over and expected to reach 23% by 2060 [2]. Globally, 9% of the population was old (over age 65) in 2019, which is expected to increase to 16% by 2050 [3]. Genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to aging and healthy lifespan. The effects of aging could be altered, and progression of aging could be slowed down [4]. Various factors contribute to aging such as defects in development and genetics, environmental factors, diseases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause harmful changes in cells and tissues [5]. Excessive ROS production causes oxidative stress, which is a predominant factor in the pathophysiology of various diseases and aging in human and other models [6] such as Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) [7] and Drosophila [8]. Calorie restriction is the most established method for successfully extending lifespan of animals and model organisms such as C. elegans [9,10,11]. However, human studies are scarce [12], and the safety and effectiveness of calorie restriction for lifespan extension in humans is controversial [1]. Therefore, it is critical to identify dietary bioactive compounds that reduce ROS levels and thereby delay aging. Among the pathways and genes involved in lifespan regulation, DAF-16 is homologous to mammalian forkhead box O1 (FOXO) transcription factor, and a key lifespan extension transcription factor that is highly conserved across a variety of organisms such as flies, worms, rodents, and humans [12,13]. C. elegans DAF-2 signaling, which is orthologous to insulin and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in mammals, is also involved in metabolism and longevity but is negatively regulated by DAF-16/FOXO signaling [14]. Additionally, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a conserved energy sensor in cells, extends lifespan of C. elegans [15]. In addition to these major pathways and genes, ROS is also involved in regulating longevity [16]. High ROS activity has been shown to be a major lifespan limiting factor in humans, C. elegans, and Drosophila [7,17,18,19]. Finally, in addition to the factors discussed above, mitochondria regulate different signaling and metabolic pathways, including ROS production and therefore plays a vital role in aging progression [20]. Dietary intervention is one of the effective non-genetic or pharmacological means to combat aging [21]. Botanicals like cranberry, strawberry, blueberry, sweet cherry, tart cherry, and curcumin all contain biologically active polyphenols, which may protect against diseases and promote health in animals, humans, and model organisms [22,23,24]. Moreover, cranberry [8,13,25], mulberry [26], and blueberry anthocyanins increase lifespan of C. elegans and Drosophila via different pathways [17,27,28]. Out of these, Montmorency tart cherry (Prunus cerasus) contains high concentration of anthocyanin flavonoids, and its consumption is known to provide numerous health benefits by reducing inflammation and production of ROS [29,30] as well as protecting against diabetes [31], cardiovascular diseases [32], muscle pain [33], and cancer [34]. Tart cherry (TC) possess increased antioxidant activity both in vivo and in vitro [35]. However, the mechanisms by which TC reverses effects of aging through antioxidant activities have not been studied yet and remain to be further elucidated. To investigate the effects of TC extract (TCE) on aging and healthspan, we used the nematode C. elegans, which is an excellent model for aging research [36] because of its short lifespan (2–3 weeks), experimental flexibility, and rapid turnover [37]. Furthermore, C. elegans behavior and physiological activities slow down with age similar to that of higher mammals, including humans [27]. Additionally, 83% of C. elegans proteome shows homology to the human proteome, and both humans and nematodes share significant age-related characteristics that can be used to study effects on health and aging [21,38]. In this paper, we determined mechanisms by which TCE extends lifespan in C. elegans using microfluidic devices for whole-life culture studies that allow efficient drug delivery compared to animals reared on agar-plates [39,40,41]. We demonstrated that TCE extends lifespan and healthspan of C. elegans by influencing the major DAF-16/FOXO lifespan regulating pathway. Consistent with this finding, TCE regulated upstream and downstream genes related to DAF-16 pathway, reduced the activity of genes related to ROS, and increased oxygen consumption rate. Therefore, our findings reveal protective anti-aging effects of TCE in vivo with robust translational potential in humans due to the feasibility of incorporating TCE into a typical human diet. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Preparation of Tart Cherry (TC) Extract Frozen TC (Cherry Marketing Institute, Dewitt, MI, USA) was ground using motor and pestle to obtain TC extract (TCE). Extracted cherry juice was filtered using 0.22 µm filter and stored in −80 °C until further use. Amounts of TCE used are based on anthocyanin concentration. We used TCE with doses between 0–12 µg anthocyanin per mL media. TCE extract from frozen TC contains 533 ± 47 µg/g total anthocyanin [29], and 1 µL TCE contains 3 µg of anthocyanins as measured by high performance liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (HPLC-MS) [35,42,43]. Additionally, TCE contains other phenolics, melatonin, vitamins A/C/E/K, niacin, beta carotene, lutein + zeaxanthin, and pantothenic acid [29,44]. To prevent oxidation, thermal degradation, chemical and biochemical changes, extracted TC was aliquoted (20 µL) and stored in −80 °C [45]. Aliquots of TCE were thawed only once and not refrozen, and TCE was replaced every day to prevent oxidation [45].2.2. Strains and Growth Conditions Worms (wild type N2, daf-16, aak-2) (Vanapalli lab, TTU, Lubbock, TX, USA) were maintained on solid nematode growth medium for two successive generations, as previously described [46]. On the third day, age-synchronized young adults were used for analyses. 2.3. Lifespan Assay At day 3, individual worms were suspended in liquid buffer (Nematode Growth Media (NGM)) and loaded into the micropillar chambers of a NemaLife microfluidic device using a syringe [40,41]. Each microfluidic device contained 30 individual chambers for animals to crawl, and one worm was loaded per chamber. Chambers were washed everyday with NGM to avoid progenies. Adult worms were fed with concentrated bacteria (100 mg/mL OP50) mixed with 3, 6, and 12 μg/mL TCE in the final mixture every day starting at day three until they all died. Chambers were rinsed everyday using liquid NGM media to wash out worm progenies and food was replenished. Worms were scored for survival every day. Worms killed during manipulation, wash errors, and bagging of worms exposed to contamination events were subsequently censored from analyses. At least three independent trials were performed for all conditions. Lifespan analyses were carried out using Kaplan–Meier statistical function using GraphPad Prism Version 7.04 software, with statistical significance considered at p < 0.05 using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.2.4. Gene Expression Analyses Age synchronized worms ~500 µL was added into 60 mm plates. We estimated that each plate had approximately same number of worms ~1000 for RNA isolation. These N2 worms were grown in 3 mL of liquid axenic media for 7 days and then treated with or without tart cherry (6 µg/mL media, 12 µg/mL media) for 3 days, after which RNA was isolated using RNA isolation kit (Zymo Research Corp, Irvine, CA, USA) following manufacturers protocol. Same amount of total RNA was transcribed into cDNA using Maxima Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, CA, USA). Maxima powerup SYBRTM Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, CA, USA) was used for making cDNA to test targeted genes including daf-16, daf-2, daf-18, aak-2, akt-1, lin-14, skn-1, ucp-4, sod-2/3 with 18s housekeeping gene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).2.5. Mitochondrial Respiration Analysis To investigate TC-mediated changes in mitochondrial function, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements were performed using the Seahorse XFe24 analyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Three days treated adult wild-type worms were washed twice in M9 buffer [47] and transferred into M9-filled wells (20 worms/well) in replicates of 4 per condition (i.e., 4 wells per strain). The experiment was repeated three times (n = 3) using the same conditions. To generate stable OCR measurements, 5 measurement cycles were performed for basal OCR, 9 cycles for maximal OCR following the addition of FCCP (10 μM final well concentration), and 5 cycles for non-mitochondrial OCR following the addition of sodium azide (40 mM final well concentration). OCR measurements were normalized to the number of worms per well. To avoid unstable OCR measurements, the final 3, 7, and 2 measurement cycles were used for the statistical analysis of basal, maximal, and non-mitochondrial OCR, respectively. 2.6. Statistical Analysis Differences in gene expression and OCR were detected with a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism 7.04, with statistical significance considered at p < 0.05.3. Results 3.1. Tart Cherry Extends Mean Lifespan of Wild Type N2 C. elegans in a Dose-Dependent Manner Under these conditions, wild type (WT) worms had a mean lifespan (MLS) of 13.31 ± 0.61 days. The MLS of worms treated with TCE at concentrations of 3, 6, and 12 μg/mL were 14.92 ± 0.58, 16.83 ± 0.77, and 16.73 ± 0.67 days, respectively. While there was no difference with 3 μg/mL, both 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE significantly (p < 0.01) increased lifespan by 26.44% and 25.69%, respectively (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S1), compared to no TCE treatment. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Tart cherry extract (TCE) extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Treatment with 6 µg/mL (pink) and 12 µg/mL (purple) TCE increased mean lifespan (MLS) in wild type (N2) C. elegans (p < 0.05) by 16.83 ± 0.77 and 16.73 ± 0.67 days, respectively compared to control or no treatment (0 µg/mL, MLS 13.31 ± 0.61 days, black) or 3 µg/mL TCE (blue, MLS: 14.92 ± 0.58 days) grown at 20 °C. Each lifespan experiment was repeated at least three independent times with similar results.3.2. Tart Cherry Effects on Genes Related to Aging To identify molecular mechanism(s) involved in promoting lifespan by TCE, we selected 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE that extended mean lifespan of WT worms in data discussed above. Using qRT-PCR, we evaluated the mRNA levels of daf-2, age-1 ortholog of human phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, and daf-16 genes in WT worms treated with 6 and 12 µg/mL TCE. Both 6 and 12 µg/mL TCE decreased mRNA expression of daf-2 (Figure 2a) and increased mRNA expression of daf-16 (Figure 2b). However, age-1 gene, downstream target of insulin/insulin like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS), had very low expression (data not shown due to low expression levels). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Effects of tart cherry extracts (TCE) on mRNA levels of (a) daf-2, (b) daf-16, (c) daf-18, (d) akt-1, (e) lin-14, (f) skn-1, (g) ucp-4, (h) sod-2, (i) sod-3, and (j) aak-2. mRNA expression of daf-2, daf-16, daf-18, skn-1, ucp-4, sod-2, aak-2 was significantly different with 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE worms compared to not treated (0 μg/mL) worms (different letters (a, b) are significantly different, p < 0.05, One-way ANOVA, n = 5, five independent experiments with triplicates). There is no significant difference in the mRNA levels of akt, lin-14 and sod-3 in the 6 and 12 μg/mL treated worms compared to not treated worms (0 μg/mL). Synchronized worms (approx. n ~ 1000) grown in the axenic media were treated with 0, 6, and 12 μg/mL TCE, and gene expression analysis was performed at day 10 after 3 days of treatment.Moreover, we measured the mRNA levels of daf-18 gene (Figure 2c), a human phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene ortholog, which downregulates DAF-2 receptor pathway by inhibiting the activity of AGE-1 [48]. Here, we observed that daf-18 was upregulated significantly by 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE, which may also be involved in down regulating IIS signaling and promoting DAF-16 nuclear localization [49]. Additionally, we measured two upstream DAF-16 inhibitors, serine-threonine protein kinase (akt-1) (Figure 2d) and lin-14 (Figure 2e) and did not find any changes in expression levels of these genes following TCE treatment. This suggests that upregulation of upstream daf-18 gene may inhibit the expression of akt-1 and lin-14. As antioxidant status and mitochondrial function are also important in aging, we measured the mRNA levels of markers involved in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis. Specifically, we measured levels of (i) SKiNhead (SKN-1), homolog to mammalian nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2); (ii) uncoupling protein-4 (UCP-4), mitochondrial uncoupling protein; (iii) SOD-2/3, a superoxide dismutase controlling ROS production; and (iv) aak-2, an AMP-activated protein kinase homolog known to directly regulate daf-16 activity. Data in Figure 2 illustrate changes in expression of these genes following TCE treatment as shown by mRNA levels of skn-1 (Figure 2f), ucp-4 (Figure 2g), sod-2 (Figure 2h), and aak-2 (Figure 2j), all of which were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the worms treated with 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE, compared to worms with no TCE treatments. By contrast, no differences were observed in mRNA levels for sod-3 (Figure 2i) with TCE treatment at either dose tested. Collectively, our results indicate that TCE acts through the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathways by directly or indirectly influencing the activities of the DAF-16 transcription factor. 3.3. Effects of TCE on C. elegans Respiration As few mitochondrial genes are changed by TCE, we next assessed changes in mitochondrial function/respiration by TCE in C. elegans, using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux analyzer, (Figure 3). Only spare respiration, which reflects “the ability of an organism to respond to increasing energy demands” [50] was significantly higher in 6 and 12 μg/mL treated worms compared to non-treated (0 μg/mL) and 3 μg/mL TCE treated worms (Figure 3a). There were no differences observed in maximum (Figure 3b), mitochondrial (Figure 3c), or non-mitochondrial (Figure 3d) respiration. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Effects of tart cherry extracts (TCE) on respiration capacity in C. elegans. WT worms were treated with 0, 3, 6, and 12 μg/mL TCE. Sea-horse analysis was used to measure how they utilize oxygen. (a) Spare respiration was significantly higher (different letters (a, b) are significantly different, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, 20 worms/well in 4 replicates, n = 3 independent experiments) in 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE treated worms compared to 0 and 3 μg/mL treated worms. No difference was observed in (b) maximum respiration, (c) non-mitochondrial, or (d) mitochondrial respiration in TCE treated worms compared to non-treated worms.3.4. TCE Did Not Extend Mean Lifespan in Daf-16 and Aak-2 Mutant Worms Because daf-16 mRNA expression was significantly increased by TCE, we tested whether daf-16 mutant worms were responsive to the same concentration of TCE used for WT worms to further validate the specific pathways involved in TCE-mediated lifespan extension. None of the TCE concentrations used (3, 6, and 12 μg/mL) significantly changed the MLS of daf-16 mutant worms (Figure 4a and Supplementary Table S2), which support our initial finding that lifespan extension by TCE is dependent on IIS/DAF-16 pathway. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Tart cherry extract (TCE) did not extend lifespan in daf-16 and aak-2 mutant C. elegans. (a) Treatments with 3 µg/mL (blue), 6 µg/mL (pink), and 12 µg/mL (purple). TCE had mean lifespans (MLS) of 12.65 ± 0.43, 13.96 ± 0.51, and 14.29 ± 0.74, respectively in daf-16 mutant C. elegans compared to control or no treatment (0 µg/mL, MLS 13.57 ± 0.51, black) grown at 20 °C. (b) Treatments with 3 µg/mL (blue, MLS: 14.83 ± 0.15), 6 µg/mL (pink, MLS: 14.41 ± 0.18), and 12 µg/mL (purple, MLS: 15.64 ± 0.83) TCE did not increase MLS in aak-2 mutant C. elegans, compared to control or no treatment (0 µg/mL, MLS: 15.68 ± 0.20, black) grown at 20 °C. Each lifespan experiment was repeated at least three independent times with similar results. Statistical significance considered at p < 0.05 using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.Moreover, since TCE significantly increased mRNA expression of aak-2 in WT worms, and published research showed that both DAF-16 and AAK-2 are involved in regulating longevity [51], we next tested involvement of AAK-2 signaling in lifespan. Interestingly, TCE (3, 6, and 12 μg/mL) did not increase the MLS of aak-2 mutant worms (Figure 4b and Supplementary Table S3), indicating importance of this pathway in TCE mediated longevity effects.4. Discussion Studies have observed that bioactive compounds from various botanicals offer a variety of health benefits against obesity, cancer, inflammation, and age-related functional decline [23,35,52,53]. Here, we showed that Montmorency Tart Cherry is a potentially effective nutraceutical for promoting healthy aging in C. elegans. We showed that TCE consumption substantially extends lifespan mainly through IIS and DAF-16 signaling. We further confirmed these findings in mutant worms lacking functional daf-16 and aak-2 genes. TCE treatment did not extend the lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. 4.1. TCE Increases Lifespan through IIS and DAF-16 Pathway In this study we used 3, 6, and 12 µg/mL of TCE to investigate its longevity effects in C. elegans. Previous studies from our lab have shown that TC increased cell survival and antioxidant activity in vitro using adipocytes [35]. Moreover, TC reduced toxic levels of ROS in both adipocytes and Zucker fatty rats [35]. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have documented lifespan effects of TCE in mammalian and only one study has showed TCE effects in model organisms [54]. Some studies have shown that TC improves memory, autophagy, and hippocampal inflammation in aged rats [52] and protects against age-related bone loss in mice [55]. Studies in C. elegans with blueberries (50, 100, and 200 mg/mL of extract) demonstrated increased MLS by 22.2%, 36.5%, and 44.4% [27] and 5 mg/mL of blueberry extracts extended MLS of Drosophila by 10% [17]. Similarly, cranberry extracts (2 mg/mL) increased MLS of C. elegans by 32.5% [13] and 20 mg/mL cranberry extracts extended MLS of Drosophila by 10% [8]; purple wheat anthocyanins (100 μg/mL) increased MLS of C. elegans by 10.5% [56]. In our study, we found that feeding C. elegans lower concentrations of TCE (3, 6, and 12 μg/mL) resulted in significant extension of MLS by 12.09% (p > 0.05), 26.44% (p < 0.05), and 25.69% (p < 0.05), respectively. These results are comparable to findings from the studies outlined above using other plant or fruit extracts [13,27,56]. However, previous studies in C. elegans were done on agar plates, which require typically very high doses to get enough drug into the worms, as the drug can diffuse into the agar, and drug delivery is not efficient. Our cultures are in liquid environment due to microfluidics (NemaLife), which is a novel approach to culture worms with several advantages: worms can crawl in an optimized micropillar arena in liquid (unlike in agar plates) that improves drug delivery; during maintenance, sieve channels dispersed progeny, thus avoiding loss of adults; they can feed the adult-only population [41]. Consistent with the advantages mentioned above, observation of lifespan-extension with low doses of TCE suggests that the microfluidic environments are efficient at drug delivery compared to agar plates. IIS pathway modulates aging and longevity and highly conserved in invertebrates and mammals. Insulin like peptide (ILPs), an insulin/IGF-1 receptor (DAF-2), serine/threonine kinase (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 (PDK-1), AKT-1/2, AGE-1)/PI3K and FOXO transcription factor (DAF-16) are major components of the IIS transduction cascades [49]. Inactivation of DAF-16 transcription factor occurs after binding of ILPs to DAF-2, inhibiting the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 [57], which negatively regulates longevity. In addition to IIS signaling, many signaling pathways such as TOR, AMPK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways are involved in aging [49,58]. Inhibition of TOR signaling increases lifespan of C. elegans and Drosophila via DAF-16 [8,59], CaMKII targets DAF-16 and modulates lifespan when worms are exposed to heat, hunger, or some other form of stressors [58], and JNK-1 signaling also regulates the activity of DAF-16 to promote lifespan post transcriptionally [60]. Very limited studies have tested effects of bioactive compounds in worms. Supplementation with wild blueberry juice (50, 100, and 200 mg/mL) increased C. elegans lifespan through CaMKII pathway that mediates osmotic stress resistance [28]. Other studies using fresh blueberry (200 μg/mL) also showed increased lifespan and stress tolerance through DAF-16 [27], cranberry extract (2 mg/mL) [25] and anthocyanin-rich purple wheat extract (100 μg/mL) [56] increased lifespan in C. elegans via the IIS/DAF-16 signaling pathway [13,25,56]. Further studies showed that oleanolic acid increased lifespan and stress tolerance through DAF-16 [61] while resveratrol, found in grape berry skin (100 μM), increased lifespan in C. elegans through sirtuin 2.1 (SIR 2.1), mammalian NAD-dependent protein deacetylase homology [62]. Moreover, blackberry extract increased antioxidant capacity in worms and provided protection against ROS generation [63]. In addition, a recently published study revealed that TCE acts as a calorie restriction mimetic and increased lifespan in C. elegans [54]. Our findings showed that TCE regulates many components in IIS pathway to influence lifespan. TCE did not increase lifespan in daf-16 mutant C. elegans, indicating that TCE may regulate lifespan through DAF-16. Further analysis of genes in WT worms also confirmed that TCE regulates lifespan mainly via DAF-16/IIS pathway, evident by significantly reduced expression of daf-2 and increased expression of daf-16 genes. Since both DAF-2 and DAF-16 in IIS pathway are highly conserved, our findings reveal the significant potential of TCE to promote healthy aging in humans. Although we did not see any changes of akt-1 and lin-14, two inhibitors of DAF-16, at mRNA levels, there are many other upstream pathways and downstream targets that we did not test. Thus, it is possible that TCE regulates upstream molecular targets of akt and lin-14, which merit further investigation, including those that control the expression of these genes such as pdk-1 and lin-4. SKN-1 is another transcription factor, which acts downstream of IIS pathway and showed reduced expression with reduced IIS signaling [64]. We found that skn-1 gene expression was also upregulated by TCE treatments in WT worms. Our results are consistent with a recently published study using Hibiscus sabdariffa L. extracts which increased SKN-1 activity and prolonged lifespan in C. elegans [65]. Studies have shown that cherries including sour cherry possess antimicrobial activity [66]. We performed all our gene expression data in liquid CMEM media without bacteria supplementation and still observed increased expression of lifespan-related genes. However, in our current study, we did not measure anti-microbial activity of TCE on the OP50 bacteria which might account for part of calorie restriction-like effects on C. elegans to increase lifespan. Therefore, these findings must be validated in future in lifespan assays.4.2. Involvement of AMPK/AAK-2 in Lifespan Determination Interestingly, TCE did not increase the MLS of aak-2 mutant worms, indicating importance of this pathway in TCE-mediated longevity effects. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a fuel-sensing enzyme that negatively regulates fatty acid synthesis and positively regulates energy production pathways such as glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation [57]. Activation of AAK-2, homolog of AMPK in C. elegans physiologically (dietary restriction) or pharmacologically (resveratrol or metformin), increased lifespan of C. elegans [67]. C. elegans has both aak-1 and aak-2, two different genes. The AMPKα1 subunit in C. elegans, AAK-2, is activated by AMP and involved in longevity [51]. By contrast, AMPKα2 subunit, AAK-2, in C. elegans is not involved in longevity effects suggesting that AAK-2 is the subunit with kinase activity [67]. Because of that, here, we evaluated the effects of TCE in aak-2 worm lifespan and aak-2 gene expression in WT worms. TCE did not change the MLS of aak-2 worms treated with TCE. Previous studies reported that aak-2 (ok524) mutants have a shorter lifespan (12%) than WT worms [51]. In contrast to these findings, however, aak-2 (rb754) mutant worms we used for our lifespan assays did not show shorter average lifespan than WT worms, and aak-2 (rb754) had 17.8% increased lifespan than WT worms. The above reported study has been conducted on agar plates, while we used microfluidic devices for the lifespan assay and fed worms everyday with liquid OP50 mixed with TCE. Changes of the environment, use of microfluidic devices, and differences in the aak-2 strains used might be a potential cause for these discrepancies. Further genetic analysis in WT worms showed increased expression of aak-2 gene with TCE treatments. Possibly, activation of aak-2 increased fatty acid oxidation in WT worms, which may change total fatty acid composition in the worms and indirectly influence the lifespan of WT worms. However, these changes were not taking place in mutant aak2, which may affect their responses to TCE and changes in fatty acid composition or lipid metabolism. These findings suggest that TCE acts partly through AAK-2 pathway and requires DAF-16 and IIS pathways to increase lifespan in C. elegans. Sirtuins-1 (Sirt-1), an ortholog of mammalian yeast deacetylase Sir-2 linked to IIS signaling pathway [12], may also be involved in lifespan regulation and merits further investigation.4.3. Role of Mitochondria in Lifespan Determination Mitochondria plays an important role in overall cellular and organism health. Mitochondria are involved in cellular metabolism, apoptosis, and production of ROS [60]. It is thought that impaired mitochondria produce more ROS which causes cellular damage and leads to aging [68,69]. SOD is an enzyme that is involved in detoxification [16,70] and is found in cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria [71]. Experiments in yeast and mice showed that knocking out sod-1 and sod-2 decreased lifespan [72,73]. In contrast, another study reported that SOD has no effect on lifespan in C. elegans [16]. In our current study, sod-2 gene levels were increased with TCE, with no changes in sod-3 gene expression. Another study using purple pitanga fruit showed increased sod-3 protein expression in C. elegans [19]. We chose sod-3 over sod-1 as they share some genetic similarities and have a certain level of amino acid homology, and sod-2 does not share substantial amino acid homology with either sod-1 or sod-3 [74]. Possibly, increased sod-2 gene expression in our study decreased mitochondrial ROS activity and extended lifespan. However, these findings remain to be confirmed using sod-2 mutant worms. Furthermore, to validate effects of TCE on ROS production, we plan in future to conduct additional functional assays to measure ROS, GSH/SG, and MDA levels. Ideal mitochondrial function is critical to have healthy cellular activity, and mitochondrial respiration is a strong indicator of good mitochondrial function [75]. An age-related decline in oxidative phosphorylation can relate to reduced mitochondrial and nuclear expressed peptides functioning in the electron transport chain (ETC) [76]. Mitochondrial health can be measured by the rate of mitochondrial respiration in ETC [77,78]. Moreover, alterations in the oxygen consumption rate are an indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction [79]. Moreover, decreased mitochondrial function reduces sufficient energy production, which plays key role during aging [80]. In order to quantify the function of mitochondria, we assessed mitochondrial OCR by TCE treatments in WT C. elegans. Our data showed that TCE treated adult worms have significantly higher spare respiration capacity with 6 and 12 μg/mL concentrations. Spare respiratory capacity is the amount of additional ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation as a result of sudden increase in energy demand [76]. Based on our findings, it is possible that increased expression of antioxidant genes, led to increased mitochondrial spare respiration by reducing ROS production and oxidative stress in part through sod-2. Another indicator of mitochondrial function is uncoupling proteins (UCPs). C. elegans expresses ucp-4. UCPs are highly conserved in many species, such as invertebrates, plants, and mammals. UCP-1 in mammals is induced by cold temperature and is a major player in thermogenesis and energy expenditure [81]. Mammals express several other UCPs, which are involved in different functions other than thermogenesis. It is reported that non-thermogenic UCPs protect cells against oxidative stress [82]. In support of these ideas, knocking down ucp-2 gene in mice generated more ROS than WT mice [83], and knocking down ucp-3 gene led to more ROS production in skeletal muscle [84]. UCP-like protein in C. elegans is thoroughly related to ucp-4 in mammals, and the two proteins share 46% sequence identity [85]. Here, we found that expression of ucp-4 was significantly higher in worms treated with 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE. Several studies documented that ucp-4 mutants may be involved in increased neuronal defects during aging [68,86], but none of the studies have reported lifespan extension effects of ucp-4 by reducing mitochondrial ROS production. Our findings suggest that reduced ROS production and increased mitochondrial function by TCE may be governed partially by increased ucp-4 expression.5. Conclusions In conclusion, we have shown that TCE increases lifespan of C. elegans, in a DAF-16-dependent manner. This may be mainly due to genetic regulation in IIS and DAF-16 pathway, partial involvement of AAK-2 signaling, increased antioxidant activity, and spare respiratory activity, allowing cells to function better under stressful conditions. Major underlying molecular targets are summarized in Figure 5, some of which require additional validations. Further studies are warranted to understand mechanisms linking oxidative stress, respiration, and longevity and their regulation by dietary antioxidants such as tart cherry anthocyanins. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Major molecular targets for TCE in C. elegans. TCE downregulated daf-2 gene and up-regulated daf-16, daf-18, skn-1, sod-2, ucp-4, and aak-2 while no changes were observed in akt-1 or lin-14 genes. These molecules may be indirectly involved in regulating mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, ant-oxidant activity, and fatty acid metabolism, and this may subsequently increase lifespan of C. elegans. Downregulated genes are shown in red; up-regulated genes are shown in blue, and those genes that were not changed by TCE are shown in green. Dotted arrows show potential indirect targets of TCE.Acknowledgments The authors thank Jenifer Hewitt, Mizanur Rahman, and Leila Lesanpezeshki in the Chemical Engineering Department at Texas Tech University for their technical support and advise during execution of this research.Supplementary Materials The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/5/1482/s1.

    "abstract": "Abstract In C. elegans, unc-89 encodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins (up 8,081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required for normal sarcomere organization and whole-animal locomotion. Multiple UNC-89 isoforms contain two protein kinase domains. There is conservation in arrangement of domains between UNC-89 and its two mammalian homologs, obscurin and SPEG: kinase, a non-domain region of 647–742 residues, Ig domain, Fn3 domain and a second kinase domain. In all three proteins, this non-domain “interkinase region” has low sequence complexity, high proline content and lacks predicted secondary structure. We report that a major portion of this interkinase (571 residues out of 647 residues) when examined by single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro displays the properties of a random coil and acts as an entropic spring. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create nematodes carrying an in-frame deletion of the same 571-residue portion of the interkinase. These animals display severe disorganization of all portions of the sarcomere in body wall muscle. Super-resolution microscopy reveals extra, short-A-bands lying close to the outer muscle cell membrane and between normally spaced A-bands. Nematodes with this in-frame deletion show defective locomotion and muscle force generation. We designed our CRISPR-generated in-frame deletion to contain an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. This HA tag results in normal organization of body wall muscle, but approximately half the normal levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms, dis-organization of pharyngeal muscle, small body size, and reduced muscle force, likely due to poor nutritional uptake.

    "introduction": "Introduction C. elegans UNC-89 is the founding member of the UNC-89/obscurin family of giant muscle proteins. Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans gene unc-89 result in slow moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines [1–3]. unc-89 is a complex gene: through the use of three promoters and alternative splicing at least 16 polypeptides are generated, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da [3–5]. Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg laying and intestinal muscles [3], and several gonadal epithelial cells [6]. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B and UNC-89-F, consist of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line [3,4]. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, our lab has systematically identified its binding partners. We have screened a yeast two hybrid library with segments representing the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners, and 6/7 have orthologs or homologs in humans [7–13]. Interactions have been verified by a combination of demonstrating binding in vitro using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and identifying muscle mutant phenotypes. Mammalian striated muscle express three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes, obscurin (OBSC), obscurin-like 1 (obsl1) and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG). UNC-89 is most similar to obscurin [14,15], which also expresses many isoforms, including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains [16]. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line, or the Z-disk [15,17]. Mutations in the human OBSC gene result in cardiomyopathies (HCM, DCM, LVNC)[18]. In addition to serving as a platform for assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with an ankyrin localized to the SR [19,20]. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myofibril organization but disorganized SR [21]. This myofibril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-89 [22]. Obsl1 is an ~200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is localized to M-lines, Z-disks and intercalated disks [23]. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line [24]. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, global KO is embryonic lethal and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growth defect (3M-growth syndrome)[25]. SPEG also exists as different sized isoforms, but the largest isoform is 3,267 aa and consists of 9 Ig and 2 Fn3 domains, and 2 protein kinase domains [26]. It can be regarded as similar to the C-terminal tandem kinase domain regions of obscurin and UNC-89. SPEG is located in a complex lying between the SR and plasma membrane (JMC) in cardiomyocytes. In the mouse, cardiac-specific KO results in DCM, whereas mutations in human SPEG result in centronuclear myopathy with DCM [26]. The in vivo substrates for the kinase domains of UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG are not known. However, sequence analysis suggests that: (i) UNC-89 PK1 is catalytically inactive, whereas PK2 is an active kinase [27]; (ii) human obscurin PK1 and PK2 are both likely to be active kinases [27], and each has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro [28]. Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro [28]. There is a suggestion that SPEG phosphorylates the JMC protein junctophilin 2 [29]. As shown in Fig. 1A, UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG have an overall conservation in organization around the kinase domains: PK1, a non-domain region of 647–742 residues, Ig, Fn, and PK2. There is very little sequence homology amongst the non-domain or “interkinase” (IK) regions of these proteins (Supplemental Figure 1). However, these IK regions have in common, a low sequence complexity, high proline content (11.8—13.3%), and an overall paucity of predicted α-helix and β-strands, and thus are likely to be predominantly random coils [9]. These properties of the IK regions are shared with the known highly elastic spring regions of human titin (PEVK and N2A/B)[30]. In this paper, we describe, for nematode UNC-89, the response of the interkinase to mechanical pulling and the phenotype of worms in which the interkinase has been deleted in-frame. This is the first time the function of this region has been explored for any member of the UNC-89/obscurin family. Fig. 1.

    "methods": "Materials and Methods Recombinant protein production A cDNA encoding a 571 amino acid portion of the interkinase region of UNC-89, IYDYLRIQ…ADIEKVTP (residues 6945—7515 in UNC-89b) was synthesized using E. coli optimal codons and cloned into pUC57 by GenScript USA,. Inc. (Piscataway, New Jersey). This plasmid was digested with SpeI and SacI, and the insert was cloned into “I27 plasmid shuffled codons (003)”, in order to express a fusion protein consisting of 6xHis-I27-I27-UNC-89 IK 571 aa—I27-I27. (I27 is the human titin Ig27 domain.) The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and the fusion protein was expressed at 20° for 5 hours after induction with 750 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The 6xHis tagged fusion protein was purified with Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen), as described in [13]. The buffer of the eluted protein was exchanged with PBS containing 10% glycerol. Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments Pulling experiments using SMFS were carried out on a home-built single-molecule Atomic Force Spectrometer as previously described in the literature [50,51]. In each experiment, we deposited 10 μL of the UNC-89 IK domain polyprotein solution (0.5 mg/mL) in PBS (pH 7.4) onto a Ni2+-NTA functionalized glass coverslip [52] covered by 50 μL of PBS. We allowed the protein to adsorb onto the substrate for 10 minutes before pulling. The spring constant of each individual cantilever (MLCT, Bruker AFM Probes, Camarillo, CA) was determined experimentally by measuring the cantilever power spectrum and using the equipartition theorem [53,54] at the beginning of each experiment. All measurements were done at a constant velocity of 500 nm/s in PBS solution at room temperature. A worm-like chain (WLC) model [55] with a variable persistence length was fit to the first I27 peak to measure the contour-length (Lc) of the IK domain in the force extension data [56]. Circular Dichroism The far UV CD spectra of the protein constructs were recorded on a Jasco J-815 Spectrometer. The protein concentration was 1 μM in 30 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1mM TCEP buffer. A 0.1 cm path length cuvette was used. Generation of CRISPR/Cas9 edited nematodes Strains PHX797 and PHX1257 were generated by SunyBiotech (http://www.sunybiotech.com) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the following ways. PHX797, unc-89(syb797), was created from wild type strain N2 to contain an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms, using sgRNAs with the following sequences: sg1: ccatcATGGCTAGTCGACGCCAAAAG, and sg2: cccaccttacccttaccatcATGG. PHX1257 unc-89(syb797syb1257) was created from PHX797 to contain a 4,614 bp in-frame deletion of the interkinase region, using sgRNAs with the following sequences: Sg1:CCTGTAGCACCGGAAGGTCGACG, Sg2:CCACCACCGACTGTGGAATACGT, Sg3:AACAGCAATTGAGAGAATTAAGG and Sg4:CCACAAAGAAGAATGATGATGGA. Sanger sequencing was used to verify the sequence alterations of each strain (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4). Both strains were outcrossed 5 times to wild type to remove most of the possible off target effects of CRISPR/Cas9; PHX797 to GB312, and PHX1257 to GB313. Antibodies and western blots We used the procedure of Hannak et al. [57] to prepare total protein lysates from wild type, unc-89(syb797) and unc-89(syb797syb1257) animals. Equal amounts of total protein from these strains were separated by a 5% separating and 3% stacking Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 2 hours and reacted with anti-UNC-89 EU30 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies [4] at 1:100 dilution, or with anti-HA antibodies (rabbit monoclonal antibody C29F4 from Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:100 dilution, followed by reaction with anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase, and ECL. For the EU30 antibody we used Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (cat. no. 32106 from Thermo Scientific), but for the anti-HA antibody we needed the increased sensitivity of SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (cat. no. 34080, from Thermo Scientific). We found that using freshly prepared or freshly purchased acrylamide solutions (e.g. ProtoGel, cat. No. EC-890 from National Diagnostics) was absolutely essential to prevent horrible streaking of the protein bands. Immunofluorescence microscopy Adult worms were fixed as described previously [58,59]. For body wall muscle staining, these primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-myosin heavy chain A (MHC A; mouse monoclonal 5–6; [31]) at 1:200; anti-UNC-89 (mouse monoclonal MH42 [4, 44]) at 1:100; anti-UNC-95 (rabbit polyclonal Benian-13; [60]) at 1:200; and anti-ATN-1 (α-actinin; MH35; [61]) at 1:200. For pharyngeal muscle staining, the fixed worms were incubated with anti-UNC-89 (rabbit polyclonal EU30; [4]) at 1:100, and anti-myosin heavy chain C (MHC C; mouse monoclonal 9.2.1; [36]), at 1:50. MH35 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Pamela Hoppe (Western Michigan University). 5–6 and 9.2.1 antibodies were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, created by the NICHD of the  and maintained at The University of Iowa, Department of Biology, Iowa City, IA 52242. The secondary antibodies included anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 594 (Invitrogen A11032), and anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 488 (Invitrogen A21206), each at 1:200 dilution. Images shown in Figures 3–6, and the Supplemental Figure 5 were captured at room temperature with a Zeiss confocal system (LSM510) equipped with an Axiovert 100M microscope and an Apochromat ×63/1.4 numerical aperture oil objective. The color balances of the images were adjusted by using Adobe Photoshop. We examined the staining of at least 3 worms in each strain. Super-resolution microscopy was performed with a Nikon N-SIM system in 3D structured illumination mode on an Eclipse Ti-E microscope equipped with a 100×/1.49 NA oil immersion objective, 488- and 561-nm solid-state lasers, and an EM-CCD camera (DU-897, Andor Technology). The color balances of the images were adjusted by using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). A Z-series at 0.2 μm intervals was taken from the outer muscle cell membrane deeper into the muscle cell, as shown in Fig. 7. Nematode locomotion assays Swimming Assay Day 2 adults from two, 6 cm NGM OP50 seeded plates were washed off the plates, washed free from bacteria and collected into M9 buffer such that the ratio of worms to buffer was 1:1. Two ml of M9 buffer was added to an unseeded 6 cm NGM plate where upon 5 μl of worm suspension was added to the center of the plate. Worms were allowed 5 minutes to adapt before a video recording of their swimming motions was made using a dissecting stereoscopic microscope fitted with a CMOS camera (Thorlabs). Ten, 10 second videos were recorded for each nematode strain from different sections of the plate, each video tracking the motion of ~10 worms. The video data was analyzed by Image J FIJI WrmTracker software [62] to obtain body bends per second (BBPS) from a total of 48–83 individual worms for each strain. The resulting worm tracks for each animal were observed, with immobilized animals in addition to upper and lower range outliers being removed from BBPS values for each strain prior to the statistical analysis. The final values for each strain were compared to wild type and tested for statistical significance using a Student T-test.Crawling Assay Day 2 adults were harvested as above, except that all washing steps used M9 buffer containing 0.2 g/L gelatin. 5 μl of worm suspension was added to the center of a 6 cm unseeded NGM plate, and the excess liquid was removed. After 5 minutes for adaptation, worm crawling was recorded using the above-mentioned strategy for extraction of body bends per second (BBPS) from a total of 66–90 individual worms for each strain. The resulting values for each strain were compared to wild type and tested for statistical significance using a Student T-test. Measurement of C. elegans muscle force using NemaFlex The maximum exertable muscle force by C. elegans strains was measured using the NemaFlex technique as previously described [34]. The technique is based on deflection of soft micropillars as the animals are crawling through the micropillar arena. The micropillar devices had pillars arranged in a square lattice with a pillar diameter of 44 μm and height of 87 μm. The gap between the pillars is 71 μm. Age synchronized day 1 adult animals were loaded individually in each chamber [63], and a 1-minute video was captured for each animal in a food-free environment at a temperature of 20 ± 1 °C. Imaging was performed in brightfield using a Nikon Ti-E microscope and Andor Zyla sCMOS 5.5 camera. Images were acquired at 5 frames per second with a 4x objective at a pixel resolution of 1.63 μm per pixel. Movies were then processed and analyzed for force values using our in-house-built image processing software (MATLAB, R2016a). Animal force measurements were calculated by identifying the maximal force exerted in each frame for an individual animal. We define the maximum exertable force f95 corresponding to the 95th percentile of these maximal forces. To account for differences in animal body diameter, we normalize f95 by the cube of animal body diameter [34]. To compare muscle forces of mutants with wild-type animals, we take the ratio of this normalized maximum exertable force and denote it as fold change in muscle force. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Polarized light microscopy Polarized light images were captured with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with 20X/0.40 Pol strain-free objective and an AxioCam MRm digital camera and software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).",
    "results": "Results To examine the nature of the IK regions of UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG in greater detail, we used JPred to predict secondary structure [30]. As shown in Supplemental Figure 2, and in Fig. 1B, there are only short stretches of α-helix (15, 9, 9, 11, 7 and 7 amino acids, from N- to C-terminus of IK), and even fewer and shorter instances of β-strands (3, 2, 3, 4 and 6 amino acids). Except for the 15-residue long region near the IK N-terminus, all the other instances of α-helices reside in the C-terminal one third of the IK sequence. These α-helices reside within the C-terminal 232 residues which is the minimal binding site determined for LIM-9 (FHL2) [9], and thus may comprise an unrecognized or novel domain. Thus, the remaining sequence of UNC-89 IK, approximately, 475 residues, is random coil. As shown in Supplemental Figure 2 and Fig. 1B, obscurin and SPEG have even fewer predicted secondary structure elements, although like UNC-89, obscurin has a fairly long α-helix of 19 residues lying within the C-terminal 52 residues. Given the nature of the amino acid sequence of the IK region of UNC-89, we wished to determine how it might respond to a mechanical pulling force using the single molecule force spectroscopy technique. To carry this out, we first expressed in E. coli 1 571 residue segment comprising the majority of the 645 residue interkinase region (IK) flanked on the N- and C-terminus by two copies of Ig27 from human titin. The response of Ig27 to pulling force is well documented and served as an internal control. In addition, the protein had a 6XHis tag at its N-terminus (Fig. 2A). After purification (Fig. 2B), the protein was allowed to attach to a glass surface coated with Ni2+-NTA to allow binding of the N-terminus of this polyprotein via its 6XHis tag. The stylus of the single-molecule force spectrometer was allowed to bind non-specifically and at random points along the polyprotein, and then pulling force was applied by moving the piezo-electric platform downward. A representative force curve of the mechanical unfolding of the polyprotein in which the stylus had attached to the C-terminus is shown in Fig. 2C. After a long and featureless trace without energy barriers, the typical unwinding of the 4 Ig domains is found. The statistical distribution of the contour length of the long featureless peak (Fig. 2D) shows that the mean contour is approximately 185 nm. This is a good match to the expected contour length of a fully unwound polypeptide of 571 amino acids, since the average length of an amino acid is 0.34 nm, i.e. 0.34 nm/aa × 571 aa = 194 nm. Based on this force curve and contour length, we can conclude that the IK has the mechanical properties of a random coil and behaves like an entropic spring. Fig. 2. The interkinase region (IK) of UNC-89 is a highly elastic spring.

We wished to determine the in vivo consequences of removing the IK from UNC-89. To do this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create an in-frame deletion of the same 571 residues that we explored with the single molecule method in vitro. However, to be able to monitor the expression of UNC-89 large isoforms in which the IK had been deleted we added an HA tag to the N-terminus of the large isoforms. We thought such tagged UNC-89 could also be used in future immunoprecipitation experiments to identify proteins in a complex with UNC-89. Animals expressing HA-UNC-89 large isoforms were obtained by CRISPR/Cas9, and the strain is designated unc-89(syb797). The proper fusion of a tag containing three consecutive HA sequences to the normal N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms was verified by Sanger sequencing (Supplemental Figure 3). The presence of the HA tag on the large UNC-89 isoforms was verified by western blot (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the HA-UNC-89 proteins could be detected by confocal microscopy to be normally localized to the sarcomeric M-lines of body wall muscle (Fig. 3B). The HA tag also does not affect the organization of body wall muscle sarcomeres as assessed by confocal microscopy using phalloidin for I-bands, or antibodies to myosin heavy chain A for A-bands, UNC-89 for M-lines, UNC-95 for the bases of M-lines and dense bodies, or ATN-1 (α-actinin) for the major portion of dense bodies (Fig. 4). As shown later, this HA tag also does not affect whole animal locomotion. However, HA tag does reduce the abundance of the UNC-89 giant isoforms (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 5). With an n=2, the level of expression from unc-89(syb797) is 51.2% (standard deviation of 11%) of the level from wild type. Fig. 3. Addition of HA tags at the N-termini of the largest UNC-89 isoforms does not affect the normal M-line localization of UNC-89 in body wall muscle sarcomeres, but does moderately reduce the level of UNC-89 giant isoforms in whole animal extracts.

Scale bar, 10 μm. Next, we used unc-89(syb797) as starting point to make an in-frame deletion of 571 residues of the IK by CRISPR/Cas9, and this strain is designated unc-89(syb797 syb1257). A schematic of the genomic region deleted is shown in Fig. 5a. Sanger sequencing was used to verify that the 4,614 bp genomic deletion resulted in an in-frame deletion of the unc-89 coding sequence (Supplemental Figure 4). Before characterizing either unc-89(syb797) or unc-89(syb797syb1257) strains further, each was outcrossed 5X to wild type, to remove most possible off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. As shown in Fig. 5B, the in-frame deletion of IK (in syb797syb1257), leads to expression of UNC-89 giant isoforms that can be detected with either antibodies to the N-terminal HA tag or our standard antibodies raised against epitopes in the middle of UNC-89. We had hoped to be able to use an antibody to PK2 to prove that the deletion is in-frame, however, two attempts to make such an antibody (in rabbits or rats) failed. Nevertheless, since the levels of large isoforms did not diminish below that shown with the HA tag (in syb797), it is likely that we achieved an in-frame deletion which does not destabilize the protein. We expected to observe slightly smaller giant isoforms from syb797syb1257 compared to wild type, but there seems to be no discernible difference (Fig. 5B). Although there are at least 14 predicted giant isoforms ranging from 5,000 to 8,081 residues each, we do not know the relative abundance of each of these giant isoforms. Deletion of 571 residues out of a total of 8,081 residues for the largest isoform would be only a decrease of 7% and may not be a difference detectable by the gel system used. However, as shown in Fig. 5C, the internal deletion of the IK of UNC-89 results in disorganization of M-lines in body wall muscle. This can be seen when either an established monoclonal for UNC-89, MH42, or anti-HA is used in immunostaining. In fact, the signals from each antibody overlap. To assess the in vivo consequences of removing the IK, we examined the organization of body wall muscle sarcomeres in greater detail, and measured whole animal locomotion and force generation. To assess sarcomere organization of the IK deletion, we took the same strategy as we did to characterize the sarcomere organization of unc-89(syb797): immunolocalization of several proteins with known sarcomere locations using confocal microscopy. Deletion of IK (in mutant syb797syb1257) results in disorganization of sarcomeres in all substructures (Fig. 6). It is important to note however that in syb797syb1257, although the pattern of UNC-89 is disorganized (i.e. not parallel straight lines as in syb797 or wild type), UNC-89 is still detectable at high levels consistent with the western blot result. Note also that in syb797syb1257, the disorganization of UNC-89 appears quite similar to the pattern of disorganization of myosin heavy chain A (MHC A). This is not unexpected as thick filaments in nematode body wall muscle have differential localization of two myosin heavy chain isoforms, with MHC A in the middle, and MHC B in the major outer portions [31]. Normally thick filaments are arranged parallel and in register, so that the M-line is the structure in the middle of the A-band, which contains MHC A, and where the thick filaments are crosslinked. Thus, when imaging C. elegans body wall muscle with light microscopy, the localization of MHC A and UNC-89 are nearly identical [4,32]. Note that upon anti-UNC-95 staining, the bases of M-lines are often branched and can overlap the bases of dense bodies (Fig. 6, right inset). Overall, these results indicate that the IK is required for the proper organization of sarcomeres. Fig. 6. unc-89(syb797 syb1257) animals that express HA-UNC-89 isoforms with an in-frame deletion of the interkinase region have disorganized myofibrils. Open in a new tab Each panel shows representative confocal images of several body wall muscle cells stained with antibodies to the indicated sarcomeric components or with rhodamine-phalloidin. Scale bar, 10 μm. We examined the organization of MHC A and UNC-89, proxies for the middle of A-bands, at higher resolution using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). In Fig. 7 A and B, it is clear that the N-terminal HA tag on the large UNC-89 isoforms (in syb797) has no effect on the normal pattern of straight parallel A-bands. However, in-frame deletion of IK (in syb797syb1257), for both MHC A and UNC-89 immunostaining, it is evident that the A-bands are broken, and much of the parallel arrangement is missing. In addition, there appear to be extra, short A-bands (indicated by arrows in Fig. 7) that lie in the spaces between otherwise nearly normal A-bands. By capturing optical sections with an interval of 0.2 μm, we noticed that these partial A-bands lie mostly close to the outer cell membrane of the muscle cells. From top to bottom of Fig. 7A and B, images are shown from close to the outer muscle cell membrane to deeper into the cell. Note that the partial A-bands lie near the outer muscle cell but do not extend as deeply as normal A-bands. Fig. 7. unc-89(syb797 syb1257) animals that express HA-UNC-89 isoforms with an in-frame deletion of the interkinase region show extra A-bands that are not full-depth. Open in a new tab After immunostaining with antibodies to MHC A (A) or antibodies to UNC-89 (B) multiple optical slices with a 0.2 μm interval were obtained by structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Yellow and blue arrows point to examples of short extra A-bands that lie between normally located A-bands and reside close to the outer muscle cell membrane. In comparison, unc-89(syb797) that expresses HA-UNC-89 shows parallel, normally spaced and full-depth A-bands. Scale bar, 5 μm. In C. elegans, the body wall muscle is required for the animal to generate the forces required for its normal swimming, crawling and burrowing locomotion [33]. Given the disorganization of sarcomeres in the body wall muscle of nematodes expressing large isoforms of UNC-89 with an in-frame deletion of the IK, we wondered if these animals would display defects in movement or in muscle force generation. First, because our strain with the IK deletion also contains an N-terminal HA tag, we measured locomotion in the strain with the HA tag alone, syb797. As shown in Fig. 8A and B, syb797 is not slower in swimming or crawling as compared to wild type. In fact, syb797 displays a statistically faster swimming than wild type. However, clearly, syb797syb1257, containing both an HA tag and IK deletion shows a 15% reduction in swimming and a 30% reduction in crawling (Fig. 8A and B). This decrease in swimming speed is comparable to that displayed by the canonical unc-89 allele e1460, but not as severe as that of alleles su75 or tm752 (Fig. 8A). The decrease in crawling of the IK deletion strain is not as severe as 3 of 4 other alleles tested (e1460, su75, tm752). In terms of muscle force exerted, as measured by the NemaFlex assay [34], all mutant alleles (including syb797 syb1257) except for tm752 are defective compared to wild type (Fig. 8C). Interestingly, syb797, which has an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large isoforms, shows no decrease in crawling, but an increase in swimming, and decreased ability to generate force. This phenotype of increased speed of swimming, no change or even increased speed of crawling, and yet decreased force, is shared with the allele ad539. unc-89(ad539), like syb797, has normally organized sarcomeres in body wall muscle, which likely accounts for lack of any decrease in swimming or crawling. (We first showed that unc-89(ad539) has normally organized sarcomeres by EM [2], but to verify this result we have immunostained its muscle with a variety of antibodies to sarcomeric proteins, and all of these are normally localized (Supplemental Figure 5)). Fig. 8. Whole worm locomotion and muscle force measurements of wild type and various unc-89 mutant alleles. Open in a new tab (A) Swimming assays show that unc-89(syb797) and unc-89(ad539) swim faster than wild type, whereas all other unc-89 mutants, including unc-89(syb797 syb1257) swim slower than wild type. (B) Crawling assays show that unc-89(ad539) crawls faster than wild type, that unc-89(syb797) crawls at the same speed as wild type, and all other unc-89 mutants crawl more slowly than wild type. C) NemaFlex force measurements show that unc-89(tm752) develops the same muscle force as wild type, whereas all other unc-89 mutants develop less force than wild type, although, unc-89(syb797 syb1257), unc-89(e1460), and unc-89(su75) are more severely affected. The actual data, including sample sizes, means, and standard errors are shown in Supplementary Table 1 for swimming and crawling and Supplementary Table 2 for NemaFlex measurements. In C. elegans, the pharynx is a neuromuscular pump required for bringing bacterial food into the worm and grinding it up before its entry into the intestine. unc-89(ad539) was first isolated in a screen for mutants that show defective feeding behavior, and found to be an allele of unc-89 by complementation testing and 3 factor mapping; by polarized light microscopy the pharyngeal muscle was shown to have reduced birefringence and abnormal arcs in the terminal or posterior bulb [35]. Based on this, and the similarity of ad539 with syb797, we examined the pharyngeal muscle structure of both these alleles, and additional alleles of unc-89 using polarized light microscopy (Fig. 9). As first noted by Waterston et al. [1], in unc-89(e1460), instead of the radially oriented filaments observed in the posterior bulb of wild type, this mutant has longitudinally oriented filaments at the periphery of the bulb (indicated by yellow arrow in Fig. 9). In fact, all the unc-89 mutants that we imaged show this defect except for tm752, which shows normal pharyngeal muscle organization. Remarkably, syb797, with the HA tag, shows the same defect. However, ad539 shows not only the defect in the terminal bulb; it also shows a defect in the anterior bulb (blue arrows in Fig. 9). The only other unc-89 allele that shows both bulbs affected is su75. Fig. 9. Polarized light images of the myofilament lattice in the pharynges of wild type and various unc-89 mutant alleles. Open in a new tab Yellow arrows indicate mis-localized arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the terminal bulb, and blue arrows indicate mis-localized arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the anterior bulb. Note that unc-89(tm752) shows pharyngeal muscle like wild type, whereas all the other unc-89 mutants show defective organization. unc-89(su75) and unc-89(ad539) are the only alleles that show defects in both the posterior and anterior bulbs. Scale bar, 50 μm. To understand the pharyngeal muscle defect further, we examined the expression of UNC-89 protein in the pharynges of wild type, syb797 and ad539. This was done by co-immunostaining worms with antibodies to UNC-89 and to the pharyngeal myosin heavy chain MHC C [36]. We have previously demonstrated that in wild type, UNC-89 is localized to the middle of thick filaments in pharyngeal muscle [4]. As shown in Fig. 10, UNC-89 is localized to the middle of thick filaments throughout the pharynx. However, in syb797 there is no detectable expression of UNC-89 in the posterior bulb. In ad539 there is no observable expression of UNC-89 throughout the pharynx. Moreover, MHC C staining reveals that in both syb797 and ad539, there are abnormal accumulations of thick filaments at the periphery of the posterior bulb (indicated by yellow arrows in Fig. 10), corresponding to the arcs observed by polarized light. The expression defects in the mutants seem to correspond with the defects in pharyngeal muscle organization and indicate that UNC-89 is required for normal organization of sarcomeres in pharyngeal muscle.

    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we explored the biophysical properties and in vivo function of an example of ~600 aa sequence that has similar features (low sequence complexity, lack of predicted domains and minimal levels of predicted secondary structure elements) and location between two protein kinase domains in the UNC-89/obscurin class of giant muscle proteins. In the case of UNC-89 IK, which was studied here, as shown in Fig. 1B, JPred predicts only short stretches of α-helices, primarily in the C-terminal third of the IK, and the majority of the sequence is predicted to be random coil. By use of single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro (Fig. 2) we showed that this IK sequence, is likely to be a random coil since it acts like an entropic spring upon application of pulling force. The nature of the IK sequence (random coil) and its physical properties (entropic spring) is shared with the highly elastic spring elements (PEVK, N2B) of another giant muscle protein, titin [37]. In the case of titin, there is good evidence to suggest that these elements unwind when muscle sarcomeres are stretched beyond their relaxed state, store potential energy and then provide a passive restoring force to allow the sarcomeres to return to their resting (relaxed) lengths [38]. To test the secondary structure prediction and have a better understanding of the response of IK to pulling force, we conducted Far-UV circular dichroism on I27-I27-IK(571)-I27-I27, and as a control protein, a polyprotein containing 9 identical repeats of the I27 domain (I279 polyprotein). As Supplemental Figure 6 shows the overall secondary structure of the I27 polyprotein (dotted line) is similar to published data on I27 polyproteins [39] showing maximum around 200 nm a minimum at ~212nm, a characteristic of a mainly β-strand structure. The overall CD spectra for the IK-I27 construct (solid line) shows a shift of the minimum to a lower wavelength (~208nm) and no clear maximum ~200 nm indicating a reduced β-strand structure and an additional random-coil component. Hence, these structural data are consistent with our AFM and JPred results and demonstrates that the interkinase region displays the properties of a random coil. To explore the muscle function of the IK, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm strain, syb797syb1257, in which most of the IK of UNC-89 was deleted in-frame. This strain also has its giant UNC-89 isoforms N-terminally tagged with HA. syb797syb1257 also seems to show reduced expression of the UNC-89 giant isoforms similar to that shown by the HA tagged strain, syb797 (an example is shown in Fig. 5B). However, in contrast to syb797 which shows normal body wall muscle sarcomere organization, syb797syb1257, shows highly disorganized body wall muscle sarcomeres. Therefore, the body wall muscle sarcomere defect in syb797syb1257 is likely caused by the lack of the IK. The normal location of UNC-89 is the M-line, the structure in which thick filaments are cross linked in the middle of the A-band. Deletion of the IK, in addition to disrupting the normal continuous and parallel M-lines or A-bands, results in formation of short A-bands which are not full-depth but confined to the portion nearest the outer muscle cell membrane, and these occur between normally spaced A-bands. Sarcomere assembly is known to occur from the outside inwards, first with the deposition of ECM proteins like perlecan, followed by localization of integrins, and then localization of integrin adhesion proteins (UNC-112 (kindlin), PAT-4 (ILK), UNC-97 (PINCH), PAT-6 (α-parvin), followed by assembly of M-line or dense body (Z-disk)-specific proteins [40,41]. We know that UNC-89 interacts with CPNA-1 [11], which in turn interacts with PAT-6, a member of the 4- protein complex that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of PAT-3 (β-integrin)[42]. It should be noted that CPNA-1 interacts with Ig1-Ig3, which is near the N-terminus of UNC-89 and remote from IK. Our results seem to indicate that these protein interactions at the membrane are not sufficient for full assembly of a M-line/A-band, and the proper spacing between A-bands. Either the length or the elasticity of UNC-89 IK is required. In future experiments, we can determine the minimum length of IK that is sufficient for full A-band assembly, and whether elasticity is crucial. We could replace the elastic IK with a sequence of similar length that is rigid. An example of a rigid sequence that could be used is the series of 4 consecutive Ig domains in human titin that are not separated by linker sequences [43]. It is tempting to speculate that the length of the interkinase is important for somehow determining the spacing between adjacent A-bands. Another possibility is that deletion of the IK in some way interferes with the activity of the active protein kinase domain of UNC-89 PK2. This is not likely because inactivation of PK2 does not result in a defect in sarcomere organization (Matsunaga et al., manuscript in preparation). So far, we have only examined the organization of body wall muscle sarcomeres in adult muscle. Therefore, we cannot distinguish a role for UNC-89 IK for sarcomere assembly vs. sarcomere stability. Indeed, it is likely that UNC-89 has more of a role in maintaining or stabilizing sarcomere structure: In strong loss of function alleles like unc-89(e1460), A-band organization is normal in early larvae [22], despite the fact that UNC-89 is expressed even in embryonic muscle [44]. In vertebrate muscle, the M-band is known to be elastic and helps titin maintain the registration of adjacent thick filaments during muscle contraction [45]. The cross-linking of thick filaments occurs by the binding of antiparallel dimers of myomesin to myosin of thick filaments. The M-band also includes complex interactions between Obsl1 and obscurin with titin, and myomesin with obscurin [46]. Although much of the elasticity and mechanical protection is provided by myomesin [47,48], our results suggest that the IK region of obscurin, which also lies in the M-band also provides some of this elasticity. Because whole animal locomotion (swimming, crawling) and force generation are diminished upon removal of the IK, we also have learned that the level of sarcomere organization found in this mutant is not sufficient for proper contractile activity. In contrast, the better level of sarcomere organization in unc-89(tm752) is sufficient to generate normal force but is not sufficient to generate normal swimming or crawling speeds. Our IK deletion strain also contains an HA tag appended to the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. We designed this for future immunoprecipitation experiments to further test whether UNC-89 interacting partners that we have discovered primarily through two hybrid screens are actually associated with UNC-89: we would create in-frame deletions of segments of UNC-89 that are suspected to bind to a partner, then IP those internally deleted UNC-89 proteins, and look for absence of the association. Somewhat surprisingly, this HA tag reduces the level of expression of the giant UNC-89 isoforms to approximately half of their wild type levels in whole worm extracts. And although the HA tag does not affect the organization of sarcomeres in body wall muscle or the ability of whole animals to swim or crawl, it does reduce the ability to generate muscle force. In addition, the HA tag results in a defect in thick filaments in the terminal bulb of the pharynx. Moreover, the level of expression of UNC-89 is reduced in the terminal bulb, consistent with the western blot result. This suggests that the HA tag at the N-terminus either reduces the stability of pharyngeal-specific UNC-89 mRNA or protein isoforms, or interferes with interaction with binding partners found only in pharyngeal muscle. Although our extensive yeast two-hybrid screens did not reveal any binding partners for the N-terminus of UNC-89, these screens cannot reveal all relevant binding partners. Also, it is possible that the HA tag reduces the steady state levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms in both pharyngeal and body wall muscle, below a critical level required for pharyngeal but not for body wall muscle sarcomere assembly and/or stability. The reduced force generated by syb797 containing the HA tag is also puzzling. However, it should be noted that syb797 and ad539 share these properties—each has normal body wall muscle, but defective pharyngeal muscle. Then, why do these two mutants generate less force? In fact, the only mutant studied that generates normal force is tm752 that does so despite having mildly disorganized body wall muscle. The key to explaining why these two mutants generate less force appears to be their reduced body diameters. In fact, as shown in Table 1, all the mutants generating less force have smaller than wild type body diameters, and defective pharynxes. tm752 has a normal body diameter and a normal pharynx. Our speculation is that all the mutants with defective pharynxes have reduced nutrition and consequently are smaller. Although our force measurements were normalized for body diameter, it is possible that reduced nutrition results in reduced metabolism and reduced energy production, and thus less ability to generate force. It is also curious that both syb797 and ad539 display greater swimming speeds and ad539 shows greater crawling speed. Perhaps this is because these thinner animals can bend more easily. Table 1.

Copyright notice ID: 9549344 MSID: MS1838736 PMID: 32645312 The publisher's version of this article is available at J Mol Biol Abstract In C. elegans, unc-89 encodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins (up 8,081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required for normal sarcomere organization and whole-animal locomotion. Multiple UNC-89 isoforms contain two protein kinase domains. There is conservation in arrangement of domains between UNC-89 and its two mammalian homologs, obscurin and SPEG: kinase, a non-domain region of 647–742 residues, Ig domain, Fn3 domain and a second kinase domain. In all three proteins, this non-domain “interkinase region” has low sequence complexity, high proline content and lacks predicted secondary structure. We report that a major portion of this interkinase (571 residues out of 647 residues) when examined by single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro displays the properties of a random coil and acts as an entropic spring. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create nematodes carrying an in-frame deletion of the same 571-residue portion of the interkinase. These animals display severe disorganization of all portions of the sarcomere in body wall muscle. Super-resolution microscopy reveals extra, short-A-bands lying close to the outer muscle cell membrane and between normally spaced A-bands. Nematodes with this in-frame deletion show defective locomotion and muscle force generation. We designed our CRISPR-generated in-frame deletion to contain an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. This HA tag results in normal organization of body wall muscle, but approximately half the normal levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms, dis-organization of pharyngeal muscle, small body size, and reduced muscle force, likely due to poor nutritional uptake. Keywords: sarcomere, giant polypeptides, UNC-89, obscurin, C. elegansIntroduction C. elegans UNC-89 is the founding member of the UNC-89/obscurin family of giant muscle proteins. Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans gene unc-89 result in slow moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines [1–3]. unc-89 is a complex gene: through the use of three promoters and alternative splicing at least 16 polypeptides are generated, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da [3–5]. Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg laying and intestinal muscles [3], and several gonadal epithelial cells [6]. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B and UNC-89-F, consist of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line [3,4]. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, our lab has systematically identified its binding partners. We have screened a yeast two hybrid library with segments representing the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners, and 6/7 have orthologs or homologs in humans [7–13]. Interactions have been verified by a combination of demonstrating binding in vitro using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and identifying muscle mutant phenotypes. Mammalian striated muscle express three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes, obscurin (OBSC), obscurin-like 1 (obsl1) and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG). UNC-89 is most similar to obscurin [14,15], which also expresses many isoforms, including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains [16]. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line, or the Z-disk [15,17]. Mutations in the human OBSC gene result in cardiomyopathies (HCM, DCM, LVNC)[18]. In addition to serving as a platform for assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with an ankyrin localized to the SR [19,20]. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myofibril organization but disorganized SR [21]. This myofibril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-89 [22]. Obsl1 is an ~200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is localized to M-lines, Z-disks and intercalated disks [23]. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line [24]. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, global KO is embryonic lethal and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growth defect (3M-growth syndrome)[25]. SPEG also exists as different sized isoforms, but the largest isoform is 3,267 aa and consists of 9 Ig and 2 Fn3 domains, and 2 protein kinase domains [26]. It can be regarded as similar to the C-terminal tandem kinase domain regions of obscurin and UNC-89. SPEG is located in a complex lying between the SR and plasma membrane (JMC) in cardiomyocytes. In the mouse, cardiac-specific KO results in DCM, whereas mutations in human SPEG result in centronuclear myopathy with DCM [26]. The in vivo substrates for the kinase domains of UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG are not known. However, sequence analysis suggests that: (i) UNC-89 PK1 is catalytically inactive, whereas PK2 is an active kinase [27]; (ii) human obscurin PK1 and PK2 are both likely to be active kinases [27], and each has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro [28]. Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro [28]. There is a suggestion that SPEG phosphorylates the JMC protein junctophilin 2 [29]. As shown in Fig. 1A, UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG have an overall conservation in organization around the kinase domains: PK1, a non-domain region of 647–742 residues, Ig, Fn, and PK2. There is very little sequence homology amongst the non-domain or “interkinase” (IK) regions of these proteins (Supplemental Figure 1). However, these IK regions have in common, a low sequence complexity, high proline content (11.8—13.3%), and an overall paucity of predicted α-helix and β-strands, and thus are likely to be predominantly random coils [9]. These properties of the IK regions are shared with the known highly elastic spring regions of human titin (PEVK and N2A/B)[30]. In this paper, we describe, for nematode UNC-89, the response of the interkinase to mechanical pulling and the phenotype of worms in which the interkinase has been deleted in-frame. This is the first time the function of this region has been explored for any member of the UNC-89/obscurin family. Fig. 1. Schematic representation of domain organization around kinase domains, and secondary structure predictions for the interkinase regions of nematode UNC-89, mouse obscurin and SPEG. Open in a new tab (A) Domain organization from PFAM predictions. Note that each protein, near its C-terminus consists of a protein kinase, a non-domain “interkinase” region (647–742 residues), Ig and Fn domains, and a second protein kinase domain. (B) Secondary structure predictions of the non-domain interkinase regions of UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG using JPred.Results To examine the nature of the IK regions of UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG in greater detail, we used JPred to predict secondary structure [30]. As shown in Supplemental Figure 2, and in Fig. 1B, there are only short stretches of α-helix (15, 9, 9, 11, 7 and 7 amino acids, from N- to C-terminus of IK), and even fewer and shorter instances of β-strands (3, 2, 3, 4 and 6 amino acids). Except for the 15-residue long region near the IK N-terminus, all the other instances of α-helices reside in the C-terminal one third of the IK sequence. These α-helices reside within the C-terminal 232 residues which is the minimal binding site determined for LIM-9 (FHL2) [9], and thus may comprise an unrecognized or novel domain. Thus, the remaining sequence of UNC-89 IK, approximately, 475 residues, is random coil. As shown in Supplemental Figure 2 and Fig. 1B, obscurin and SPEG have even fewer predicted secondary structure elements, although like UNC-89, obscurin has a fairly long α-helix of 19 residues lying within the C-terminal 52 residues. Given the nature of the amino acid sequence of the IK region of UNC-89, we wished to determine how it might respond to a mechanical pulling force using the single molecule force spectroscopy technique. To carry this out, we first expressed in E. coli 1 571 residue segment comprising the majority of the 645 residue interkinase region (IK) flanked on the N- and C-terminus by two copies of Ig27 from human titin. The response of Ig27 to pulling force is well documented and served as an internal control. In addition, the protein had a 6XHis tag at its N-terminus (Fig. 2A). After purification (Fig. 2B), the protein was allowed to attach to a glass surface coated with Ni2+-NTA to allow binding of the N-terminus of this polyprotein via its 6XHis tag. The stylus of the single-molecule force spectrometer was allowed to bind non-specifically and at random points along the polyprotein, and then pulling force was applied by moving the piezo-electric platform downward. A representative force curve of the mechanical unfolding of the polyprotein in which the stylus had attached to the C-terminus is shown in Fig. 2C. After a long and featureless trace without energy barriers, the typical unwinding of the 4 Ig domains is found. The statistical distribution of the contour length of the long featureless peak (Fig. 2D) shows that the mean contour is approximately 185 nm. This is a good match to the expected contour length of a fully unwound polypeptide of 571 amino acids, since the average length of an amino acid is 0.34 nm, i.e. 0.34 nm/aa × 571 aa = 194 nm. Based on this force curve and contour length, we can conclude that the IK has the mechanical properties of a random coil and behaves like an entropic spring. Fig. 2.

The solid line represents a Gaussian fit of the histogram.We wished to determine the in vivo consequences of removing the IK from UNC-89. To do this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create an in-frame deletion of the same 571 residues that we explored with the single molecule method in vitro. However, to be able to monitor the expression of UNC-89 large isoforms in which the IK had been deleted we added an HA tag to the N-terminus of the large isoforms. We thought such tagged UNC-89 could also be used in future immunoprecipitation experiments to identify proteins in a complex with UNC-89. Animals expressing HA-UNC-89 large isoforms were obtained by CRISPR/Cas9, and the strain is designated unc-89(syb797). The proper fusion of a tag containing three consecutive HA sequences to the normal N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms was verified by Sanger sequencing (Supplemental Figure 3). The presence of the HA tag on the large UNC-89 isoforms was verified by western blot (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the HA-UNC-89 proteins could be detected by confocal microscopy to be normally localized to the sarcomeric M-lines of body wall muscle (Fig. 3B). The HA tag also does not affect the organization of body wall muscle sarcomeres as assessed by confocal microscopy using phalloidin for I-bands, or antibodies to myosin heavy chain A for A-bands, UNC-89 for M-lines, UNC-95 for the bases of M-lines and dense bodies, or ATN-1 (α-actinin) for the major portion of dense bodies (Fig. 4). As shown later, this HA tag also does not affect whole animal locomotion. However, HA tag does reduce the abundance of the UNC-89 giant isoforms (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 5). With an n=2, the level of expression from unc-89(syb797) is 51.2% (standard deviation of 11%) of the level from wild type. Fig. 3. Addition of HA tags at the N-termini of the largest UNC-89 isoforms does not affect the normal M-line localization of UNC-89 in body wall muscle sarcomeres, but does moderately reduce the level of UNC-89 giant isoforms in whole animal extracts.

Scale bar, 10 μm.Next, we used unc-89(syb797) as starting point to make an in-frame deletion of 571 residues of the IK by CRISPR/Cas9, and this strain is designated unc-89(syb797 syb1257). A schematic of the genomic region deleted is shown in Fig. 5a. Sanger sequencing was used to verify that the 4,614 bp genomic deletion resulted in an in-frame deletion of the unc-89 coding sequence (Supplemental Figure 4). Before characterizing either unc-89(syb797) or unc-89(syb797syb1257) strains further, each was outcrossed 5X to wild type, to remove most possible off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. As shown in Fig. 5B, the in-frame deletion of IK (in syb797syb1257), leads to expression of UNC-89 giant isoforms that can be detected with either antibodies to the N-terminal HA tag or our standard antibodies raised against epitopes in the middle of UNC-89. We had hoped to be able to use an antibody to PK2 to prove that the deletion is in-frame, however, two attempts to make such an antibody (in rabbits or rats) failed. Nevertheless, since the levels of large isoforms did not diminish below that shown with the HA tag (in syb797), it is likely that we achieved an in-frame deletion which does not destabilize the protein. We expected to observe slightly smaller giant isoforms from syb797syb1257 compared to wild type, but there seems to be no discernible difference (Fig. 5B). Although there are at least 14 predicted giant isoforms ranging from 5,000 to 8,081 residues each, we do not know the relative abundance of each of these giant isoforms. Deletion of 571 residues out of a total of 8,081 residues for the largest isoform would be only a decrease of 7% and may not be a difference detectable by the gel system used. However, as shown in Fig. 5C, the internal deletion of the IK of UNC-89 results in disorganization of M-lines in body wall muscle. This can be seen when either an established monoclonal for UNC-89, MH42, or anti-HA is used in immunostaining. In fact, the signals from each antibody overlap. To assess the in vivo consequences of removing the IK, we examined the organization of body wall muscle sarcomeres in greater detail, and measured whole animal locomotion and force generation. To assess sarcomere organization of the IK deletion, we took the same strategy as we did to characterize the sarcomere organization of unc-89(syb797): immunolocalization of several proteins with known sarcomere locations using confocal microscopy. Deletion of IK (in mutant syb797syb1257) results in disorganization of sarcomeres in all substructures (Fig. 6). It is important to note however that in syb797syb1257, although the pattern of UNC-89 is disorganized (i.e. not parallel straight lines as in syb797 or wild type), UNC-89 is still detectable at high levels consistent with the western blot result. Note also that in syb797syb1257, the disorganization of UNC-89 appears quite similar to the pattern of disorganization of myosin heavy chain A (MHC A). This is not unexpected as thick filaments in nematode body wall muscle have differential localization of two myosin heavy chain isoforms, with MHC A in the middle, and MHC B in the major outer portions [31]. Normally thick filaments are arranged parallel and in register, so that the M-line is the structure in the middle of the A-band, which contains MHC A, and where the thick filaments are crosslinked. Thus, when imaging C. elegans body wall muscle with light microscopy, the localization of MHC A and UNC-89 are nearly identical [4,32]. Note that upon anti-UNC-95 staining, the bases of M-lines are often branched and can overlap the bases of dense bodies (Fig. 6, right inset). Overall, these results indicate that the IK is required for the proper organization of sarcomeres. Fig. 6. unc-89(syb797 syb1257) animals that express HA-UNC-89 isoforms with an in-frame deletion of the interkinase region have disorganized myofibrils. Open in a new tab Each panel shows representative confocal images of several body wall muscle cells stained with antibodies to the indicated sarcomeric components or with rhodamine-phalloidin. Scale bar, 10 μm.We examined the organization of MHC A and UNC-89, proxies for the middle of A-bands, at higher resolution using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). In Fig. 7 A and B, it is clear that the N-terminal HA tag on the large UNC-89 isoforms (in syb797) has no effect on the normal pattern of straight parallel A-bands. However, in-frame deletion of IK (in syb797syb1257), for both MHC A and UNC-89 immunostaining, it is evident that the A-bands are broken, and much of the parallel arrangement is missing. In addition, there appear to be extra, short A-bands (indicated by arrows in Fig. 7) that lie in the spaces between otherwise nearly normal A-bands. By capturing optical sections with an interval of 0.2 μm, we noticed that these partial A-bands lie mostly close to the outer cell membrane of the muscle cells. From top to bottom of Fig. 7A and B, images are shown from close to the outer muscle cell membrane to deeper into the cell. Note that the partial A-bands lie near the outer muscle cell but do not extend as deeply as normal A-bands. Fig. 7. unc-89(syb797 syb1257) animals that express HA-UNC-89 isoforms with an in-frame deletion of the interkinase region show extra A-bands that are not full-depth. Open in a new tab After immunostaining with antibodies to MHC A (A) or antibodies to UNC-89 (B) multiple optical slices with a 0.2 μm interval were obtained by structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Yellow and blue arrows point to examples of short extra A-bands that lie between normally located A-bands and reside close to the outer muscle cell membrane. In comparison, unc-89(syb797) that expresses HA-UNC-89 shows parallel, normally spaced and full-depth A-bands. Scale bar, 5 μm.In C. elegans, the body wall muscle is required for the animal to generate the forces required for its normal swimming, crawling and burrowing locomotion [33]. Given the disorganization of sarcomeres in the body wall muscle of nematodes expressing large isoforms of UNC-89 with an in-frame deletion of the IK, we wondered if these animals would display defects in movement or in muscle force generation. First, because our strain with the IK deletion also contains an N-terminal HA tag, we measured locomotion in the strain with the HA tag alone, syb797. As shown in Fig. 8A and B, syb797 is not slower in swimming or crawling as compared to wild type. In fact, syb797 displays a statistically faster swimming than wild type. However, clearly, syb797syb1257, containing both an HA tag and IK deletion shows a 15% reduction in swimming and a 30% reduction in crawling (Fig. 8A and B). This decrease in swimming speed is comparable to that displayed by the canonical unc-89 allele e1460, but not as severe as that of alleles su75 or tm752 (Fig. 8A). The decrease in crawling of the IK deletion strain is not as severe as 3 of 4 other alleles tested (e1460, su75, tm752). In terms of muscle force exerted, as measured by the NemaFlex assay [34], all mutant alleles (including syb797 syb1257) except for tm752 are defective compared to wild type (Fig. 8C). Interestingly, syb797, which has an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large isoforms, shows no decrease in crawling, but an increase in swimming, and decreased ability to generate force. This phenotype of increased speed of swimming, no change or even increased speed of crawling, and yet decreased force, is shared with the allele ad539. unc-89(ad539), like syb797, has normally organized sarcomeres in body wall muscle, which likely accounts for lack of any decrease in swimming or crawling. (We first showed that unc-89(ad539) has normally organized sarcomeres by EM [2], but to verify this result we have immunostained its muscle with a variety of antibodies to sarcomeric proteins, and all of these are normally localized (Supplemental Figure 5)). Fig. 8. Whole worm locomotion and muscle force measurements of wild type and various unc-89 mutant alleles. Open in a new tab (A) Swimming assays show that unc-89(syb797) and unc-89(ad539) swim faster than wild type, whereas all other unc-89 mutants, including unc-89(syb797 syb1257) swim slower than wild type. (B) Crawling assays show that unc-89(ad539) crawls faster than wild type, that unc-89(syb797) crawls at the same speed as wild type, and all other unc-89 mutants crawl more slowly than wild type. C) NemaFlex force measurements show that unc-89(tm752) develops the same muscle force as wild type, whereas all other unc-89 mutants develop less force than wild type, although, unc-89(syb797 syb1257), unc-89(e1460), and unc-89(su75) are more severely affected. The actual data, including sample sizes, means, and standard errors are shown in Supplementary Table 1 for swimming and crawling and Supplementary Table 2 for NemaFlex measurements.In C. elegans, the pharynx is a neuromuscular pump required for bringing bacterial food into the worm and grinding it up before its entry into the intestine. unc-89(ad539) was first isolated in a screen for mutants that show defective feeding behavior, and found to be an allele of unc-89 by complementation testing and 3 factor mapping; by polarized light microscopy the pharyngeal muscle was shown to have reduced birefringence and abnormal arcs in the terminal or posterior bulb [35]. Based on this, and the similarity of ad539 with syb797, we examined the pharyngeal muscle structure of both these alleles, and additional alleles of unc-89 using polarized light microscopy (Fig. 9). As first noted by Waterston et al. [1], in unc-89(e1460), instead of the radially oriented filaments observed in the posterior bulb of wild type, this mutant has longitudinally oriented filaments at the periphery of the bulb (indicated by yellow arrow in Fig. 9). In fact, all the unc-89 mutants that we imaged show this defect except for tm752, which shows normal pharyngeal muscle organization. Remarkably, syb797, with the HA tag, shows the same defect. However, ad539 shows not only the defect in the terminal bulb; it also shows a defect in the anterior bulb (blue arrows in Fig. 9). The only other unc-89 allele that shows both bulbs affected is su75. Fig. 9. Polarized light images of the myofilament lattice in the pharynges of wild type and various unc-89 mutant alleles. Open in a new tab Yellow arrows indicate mis-localized arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the terminal bulb, and blue arrows indicate mis-localized arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the anterior bulb. Note that unc-89(tm752) shows pharyngeal muscle like wild type, whereas all the other unc-89 mutants show defective organization. unc-89(su75) and unc-89(ad539) are the only alleles that show defects in both the posterior and anterior bulbs. Scale bar, 50 μm.To understand the pharyngeal muscle defect further, we examined the expression of UNC-89 protein in the pharynges of wild type, syb797 and ad539. This was done by co-immunostaining worms with antibodies to UNC-89 and to the pharyngeal myosin heavy chain MHC C [36]. We have previously demonstrated that in wild type, UNC-89 is localized to the middle of thick filaments in pharyngeal muscle [4]. As shown in Fig. 10, UNC-89 is localized to the middle of thick filaments throughout the pharynx. However, in syb797 there is no detectable expression of UNC-89 in the posterior bulb. In ad539 there is no observable expression of UNC-89 throughout the pharynx. Moreover, MHC C staining reveals that in both syb797 and ad539, there are abnormal accumulations of thick filaments at the periphery of the posterior bulb (indicated by yellow arrows in Fig. 10), corresponding to the arcs observed by polarized light. The expression defects in the mutants seem to correspond with the defects in pharyngeal muscle organization and indicate that UNC-89 is required for normal organization of sarcomeres in pharyngeal muscle. Fig. 10. unc-89(syb797) and unc-89(ad539) have reduced levels of expression of UNC-89 in pharyngeal muscle. Open in a new tab The indicated strains were immunostained with antibodies to UNC-89 and the pharyngeal-specific myosin heavy chain C (MHC C), and representative confocal images of the pharynx are shown. Note that unc-89(syb797) shows reduced UNC-89 expression in the terminal bulb, whereas unc-89(ad539) shows reduced UNC-89 expression in both the terminal and anterior bulbs. Green arrowhead, anterior bulb; red arrowhead, posterior bulb; yellow arrow, arc-like thick filaments mis-placed at the periphery of the posterior bulb. Scale bar, 10 μm.Discussion In this study, we explored the biophysical properties and in vivo function of an example of ~600 aa sequence that has similar features (low sequence complexity, lack of predicted domains and minimal levels of predicted secondary structure elements) and location between two protein kinase domains in the UNC-89/obscurin class of giant muscle proteins. In the case of UNC-89 IK, which was studied here, as shown in Fig. 1B, JPred predicts only short stretches of α-helices, primarily in the C-terminal third of the IK, and the majority of the sequence is predicted to be random coil. By use of single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro (Fig. 2) we showed that this IK sequence, is likely to be a random coil since it acts like an entropic spring upon application of pulling force. The nature of the IK sequence (random coil) and its physical properties (entropic spring) is shared with the highly elastic spring elements (PEVK, N2B) of another giant muscle protein, titin [37]. In the case of titin, there is good evidence to suggest that these elements unwind when muscle sarcomeres are stretched beyond their relaxed state, store potential energy and then provide a passive restoring force to allow the sarcomeres to return to their resting (relaxed) lengths [38]. To test the secondary structure prediction and have a better understanding of the response of IK to pulling force, we conducted Far-UV circular dichroism on I27-I27-IK(571)-I27-I27, and as a control protein, a polyprotein containing 9 identical repeats of the I27 domain (I279 polyprotein). As Supplemental Figure 6 shows the overall secondary structure of the I27 polyprotein (dotted line) is similar to published data on I27 polyproteins [39] showing maximum around 200 nm a minimum at ~212nm, a characteristic of a mainly β-strand structure. The overall CD spectra for the IK-I27 construct (solid line) shows a shift of the minimum to a lower wavelength (~208nm) and no clear maximum ~200 nm indicating a reduced β-strand structure and an additional random-coil component. Hence, these structural data are consistent with our AFM and JPred results and demonstrates that the interkinase region displays the properties of a random coil. To explore the muscle function of the IK, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm strain, syb797syb1257, in which most of the IK of UNC-89 was deleted in-frame. This strain also has its giant UNC-89 isoforms N-terminally tagged with HA. syb797syb1257 also seems to show reduced expression of the UNC-89 giant isoforms similar to that shown by the HA tagged strain, syb797 (an example is shown in Fig. 5B). However, in contrast to syb797 which shows normal body wall muscle sarcomere organization, syb797syb1257, shows highly disorganized body wall muscle sarcomeres. Therefore, the body wall muscle sarcomere defect in syb797syb1257 is likely caused by the lack of the IK. The normal location of UNC-89 is the M-line, the structure in which thick filaments are cross linked in the middle of the A-band. Deletion of the IK, in addition to disrupting the normal continuous and parallel M-lines or A-bands, results in formation of short A-bands which are not full-depth but confined to the portion nearest the outer muscle cell membrane, and these occur between normally spaced A-bands. Sarcomere assembly is known to occur from the outside inwards, first with the deposition of ECM proteins like perlecan, followed by localization of integrins, and then localization of integrin adhesion proteins (UNC-112 (kindlin), PAT-4 (ILK), UNC-97 (PINCH), PAT-6 (α-parvin), followed by assembly of M-line or dense body (Z-disk)-specific proteins [40,41]. We know that UNC-89 interacts with CPNA-1 [11], which in turn interacts with PAT-6, a member of the 4- protein complex that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of PAT-3 (β-integrin)[42]. It should be noted that CPNA-1 interacts with Ig1-Ig3, which is near the N-terminus of UNC-89 and remote from IK. Our results seem to indicate that these protein interactions at the membrane are not sufficient for full assembly of a M-line/A-band, and the proper spacing between A-bands. Either the length or the elasticity of UNC-89 IK is required. In future experiments, we can determine the minimum length of IK that is sufficient for full A-band assembly, and whether elasticity is crucial. We could replace the elastic IK with a sequence of similar length that is rigid. An example of a rigid sequence that could be used is the series of 4 consecutive Ig domains in human titin that are not separated by linker sequences [43]. It is tempting to speculate that the length of the interkinase is important for somehow determining the spacing between adjacent A-bands. Another possibility is that deletion of the IK in some way interferes with the activity of the active protein kinase domain of UNC-89 PK2. This is not likely because inactivation of PK2 does not result in a defect in sarcomere organization (Matsunaga et al., manuscript in preparation). So far, we have only examined the organization of body wall muscle sarcomeres in adult muscle. Therefore, we cannot distinguish a role for UNC-89 IK for sarcomere assembly vs. sarcomere stability. Indeed, it is likely that UNC-89 has more of a role in maintaining or stabilizing sarcomere structure: In strong loss of function alleles like unc-89(e1460), A-band organization is normal in early larvae [22], despite the fact that UNC-89 is expressed even in embryonic muscle [44]. In vertebrate muscle, the M-band is known to be elastic and helps titin maintain the registration of adjacent thick filaments during muscle contraction [45]. The cross-linking of thick filaments occurs by the binding of antiparallel dimers of myomesin to myosin of thick filaments. The M-band also includes complex interactions between Obsl1 and obscurin with titin, and myomesin with obscurin [46]. Although much of the elasticity and mechanical protection is provided by myomesin [47,48], our results suggest that the IK region of obscurin, which also lies in the M-band also provides some of this elasticity. Because whole animal locomotion (swimming, crawling) and force generation are diminished upon removal of the IK, we also have learned that the level of sarcomere organization found in this mutant is not sufficient for proper contractile activity. In contrast, the better level of sarcomere organization in unc-89(tm752) is sufficient to generate normal force but is not sufficient to generate normal swimming or crawling speeds. Our IK deletion strain also contains an HA tag appended to the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. We designed this for future immunoprecipitation experiments to further test whether UNC-89 interacting partners that we have discovered primarily through two hybrid screens are actually associated with UNC-89: we would create in-frame deletions of segments of UNC-89 that are suspected to bind to a partner, then IP those internally deleted UNC-89 proteins, and look for absence of the association. Somewhat surprisingly, this HA tag reduces the level of expression of the giant UNC-89 isoforms to approximately half of their wild type levels in whole worm extracts. And although the HA tag does not affect the organization of sarcomeres in body wall muscle or the ability of whole animals to swim or crawl, it does reduce the ability to generate muscle force. In addition, the HA tag results in a defect in thick filaments in the terminal bulb of the pharynx. Moreover, the level of expression of UNC-89 is reduced in the terminal bulb, consistent with the western blot result. This suggests that the HA tag at the N-terminus either reduces the stability of pharyngeal-specific UNC-89 mRNA or protein isoforms, or interferes with interaction with binding partners found only in pharyngeal muscle. Although our extensive yeast two-hybrid screens did not reveal any binding partners for the N-terminus of UNC-89, these screens cannot reveal all relevant binding partners. Also, it is possible that the HA tag reduces the steady state levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms in both pharyngeal and body wall muscle, below a critical level required for pharyngeal but not for body wall muscle sarcomere assembly and/or stability. The reduced force generated by syb797 containing the HA tag is also puzzling. However, it should be noted that syb797 and ad539 share these properties—each has normal body wall muscle, but defective pharyngeal muscle. Then, why do these two mutants generate less force? In fact, the only mutant studied that generates normal force is tm752 that does so despite having mildly disorganized body wall muscle. The key to explaining why these two mutants generate less force appears to be their reduced body diameters. In fact, as shown in Table 1, all the mutants generating less force have smaller than wild type body diameters, and defective pharynxes. tm752 has a normal body diameter and a normal pharynx. Our speculation is that all the mutants with defective pharynxes have reduced nutrition and consequently are smaller. Although our force measurements were normalized for body diameter, it is possible that reduced nutrition results in reduced metabolism and reduced energy production, and thus less ability to generate force. It is also curious that both syb797 and ad539 display greater swimming speeds and ad539 shows greater crawling speed. Perhaps this is because these thinner animals can bend more easily. Table 1.

Thus, in the future, cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in human obscurin might be studied in C. elegans by creating the analogous mutations in unc-89, and using these mutants for genetic suppressor and drug screens.Materials and Methods Recombinant protein production A cDNA encoding a 571 amino acid portion of the interkinase region of UNC-89, IYDYLRIQ…ADIEKVTP (residues 6945—7515 in UNC-89b) was synthesized using E. coli optimal codons and cloned into pUC57 by GenScript USA,. Inc. (Piscataway, New Jersey). This plasmid was digested with SpeI and SacI, and the insert was cloned into “I27 plasmid shuffled codons (003)”, in order to express a fusion protein consisting of 6xHis-I27-I27-UNC-89 IK 571 aa—I27-I27. (I27 is the human titin Ig27 domain.) The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and the fusion protein was expressed at 20° for 5 hours after induction with 750 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The 6xHis tagged fusion protein was purified with Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen), as described in [13]. The buffer of the eluted protein was exchanged with PBS containing 10% glycerol.Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments Pulling experiments using SMFS were carried out on a home-built single-molecule Atomic Force Spectrometer as previously described in the literature [50,51]. In each experiment, we deposited 10 μL of the UNC-89 IK domain polyprotein solution (0.5 mg/mL) in PBS (pH 7.4) onto a Ni2+-NTA functionalized glass coverslip [52] covered by 50 μL of PBS. We allowed the protein to adsorb onto the substrate for 10 minutes before pulling. The spring constant of each individual cantilever (MLCT, Bruker AFM Probes, Camarillo, CA) was determined experimentally by measuring the cantilever power spectrum and using the equipartition theorem [53,54] at the beginning of each experiment. All measurements were done at a constant velocity of 500 nm/s in PBS solution at room temperature. A worm-like chain (WLC) model [55] with a variable persistence length was fit to the first I27 peak to measure the contour-length (Lc) of the IK domain in the force extension data [56].Circular Dichroism The far UV CD spectra of the protein constructs were recorded on a Jasco J-815 Spectrometer. The protein concentration was 1 μM in 30 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1mM TCEP buffer. A 0.1 cm path length cuvette was used.Generation of CRISPR/Cas9 edited nematodes Strains PHX797 and PHX1257 were generated by SunyBiotech (http://www.sunybiotech.com) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the following ways. PHX797, unc-89(syb797), was created from wild type strain N2 to contain an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms, using sgRNAs with the following sequences: sg1: ccatcATGGCTAGTCGACGCCAAAAG, and sg2: cccaccttacccttaccatcATGG. PHX1257 unc-89(syb797syb1257) was created from PHX797 to contain a 4,614 bp in-frame deletion of the interkinase region, using sgRNAs with the following sequences: Sg1:CCTGTAGCACCGGAAGGTCGACG, Sg2:CCACCACCGACTGTGGAATACGT, Sg3:AACAGCAATTGAGAGAATTAAGG and Sg4:CCACAAAGAAGAATGATGATGGA. Sanger sequencing was used to verify the sequence alterations of each strain (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4). Both strains were outcrossed 5 times to wild type to remove most of the possible off target effects of CRISPR/Cas9; PHX797 to GB312, and PHX1257 to GB313.Antibodies and western blots We used the procedure of Hannak et al. [57] to prepare total protein lysates from wild type, unc-89(syb797) and unc-89(syb797syb1257) animals. Equal amounts of total protein from these strains were separated by a 5% separating and 3% stacking Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 2 hours and reacted with anti-UNC-89 EU30 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies [4] at 1:100 dilution, or with anti-HA antibodies (rabbit monoclonal antibody C29F4 from Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:100 dilution, followed by reaction with anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase, and ECL. For the EU30 antibody we used Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (cat. no. 32106 from Thermo Scientific), but for the anti-HA antibody we needed the increased sensitivity of SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (cat. no. 34080, from Thermo Scientific). We found that using freshly prepared or freshly purchased acrylamide solutions (e.g. ProtoGel, cat. No. EC-890 from National Diagnostics) was absolutely essential to prevent horrible streaking of the protein bands.Immunofluorescence microscopy Adult worms were fixed as described previously [58,59]. For body wall muscle staining, these primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-myosin heavy chain A (MHC A; mouse monoclonal 5–6; [31]) at 1:200; anti-UNC-89 (mouse monoclonal MH42 [4, 44]) at 1:100; anti-UNC-95 (rabbit polyclonal Benian-13; [60]) at 1:200; and anti-ATN-1 (α-actinin; MH35; [61]) at 1:200. For pharyngeal muscle staining, the fixed worms were incubated with anti-UNC-89 (rabbit polyclonal EU30; [4]) at 1:100, and anti-myosin heavy chain C (MHC C; mouse monoclonal 9.2.1; [36]), at 1:50. MH35 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Pamela Hoppe (Western Michigan University). 5–6 and 9.2.1 antibodies were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, created by the NICHD of the  and maintained at The University of Iowa, Department of Biology, Iowa City, IA 52242. The secondary antibodies included anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 594 (Invitrogen A11032), and anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 488 (Invitrogen A21206), each at 1:200 dilution. Images shown in Figures 3–6, and the Supplemental Figure 5 were captured at room temperature with a Zeiss confocal system (LSM510) equipped with an Axiovert 100M microscope and an Apochromat ×63/1.4 numerical aperture oil objective. The color balances of the images were adjusted by using Adobe Photoshop. We examined the staining of at least 3 worms in each strain. Super-resolution microscopy was performed with a Nikon N-SIM system in 3D structured illumination mode on an Eclipse Ti-E microscope equipped with a 100×/1.49 NA oil immersion objective, 488- and 561-nm solid-state lasers, and an EM-CCD camera (DU-897, Andor Technology). The color balances of the images were adjusted by using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). A Z-series at 0.2 μm intervals was taken from the outer muscle cell membrane deeper into the muscle cell, as shown in Fig. 7.Nematode locomotion assays Swimming Assay Day 2 adults from two, 6 cm NGM OP50 seeded plates were washed off the plates, washed free from bacteria and collected into M9 buffer such that the ratio of worms to buffer was 1:1. Two ml of M9 buffer was added to an unseeded 6 cm NGM plate where upon 5 μl of worm suspension was added to the center of the plate. Worms were allowed 5 minutes to adapt before a video recording of their swimming motions was made using a dissecting stereoscopic microscope fitted with a CMOS camera (Thorlabs). Ten, 10 second videos were recorded for each nematode strain from different sections of the plate, each video tracking the motion of ~10 worms. The video data was analyzed by Image J FIJI WrmTracker software [62] to obtain body bends per second (BBPS) from a total of 48–83 individual worms for each strain. The resulting worm tracks for each animal were observed, with immobilized animals in addition to upper and lower range outliers being removed from BBPS values for each strain prior to the statistical analysis. The final values for each strain were compared to wild type and tested for statistical significance using a Student T-test.Crawling Assay Day 2 adults were harvested as above, except that all washing steps used M9 buffer containing 0.2 g/L gelatin. 5 μl of worm suspension was added to the center of a 6 cm unseeded NGM plate, and the excess liquid was removed. After 5 minutes for adaptation, worm crawling was recorded using the above-mentioned strategy for extraction of body bends per second (BBPS) from a total of 66–90 individual worms for each strain. The resulting values for each strain were compared to wild type and tested for statistical significance using a Student T-test.Measurement of C. elegans muscle force using NemaFlex The maximum exertable muscle force by C. elegans strains was measured using the NemaFlex technique as previously described [34]. The technique is based on deflection of soft micropillars as the animals are crawling through the micropillar arena. The micropillar devices had pillars arranged in a square lattice with a pillar diameter of 44 μm and height of 87 μm. The gap between the pillars is 71 μm. Age synchronized day 1 adult animals were loaded individually in each chamber [63], and a 1-minute video was captured for each animal in a food-free environment at a temperature of 20 ± 1 °C. Imaging was performed in brightfield using a Nikon Ti-E microscope and Andor Zyla sCMOS 5.5 camera. Images were acquired at 5 frames per second with a 4x objective at a pixel resolution of 1.63 μm per pixel. Movies were then processed and analyzed for force values using our in-house-built image processing software (MATLAB, R2016a). Animal force measurements were calculated by identifying the maximal force exerted in each frame for an individual animal. We define the maximum exertable force f95 corresponding to the 95th percentile of these maximal forces. To account for differences in animal body diameter, we normalize f95 by the cube of animal body diameter [34]. To compare muscle forces of mutants with wild-type animals, we take the ratio of this normalized maximum exertable force and denote it as fold change in muscle force. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Polarized light microscopy Polarized light images were captured with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with 20X/0.40 Pol strain-free objective and an AxioCam MRm digital camera and software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).Supplementary Material Supp. Fig. 1Supplemental Fig. 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we report a microfluidic device for the whole-life culture of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the scoring of animal survival and health measures. This device referred to as the NemaLife chip features: (1) an optimized micropillar arena in which animals can crawl, (2) sieve channels that separate progeny and prevent the loss of adults from the arena during culture maintenance, and (3) ports that allow rapid accessibility for feeding the adult-only population and introducing reagents as needed. The pillar arena geometry was optimized to accommodate the growing body size during culture and emulate the body gait and locomotion of animals reared on agar. Likewise, feeding protocols were optimized to recapitulate longevity outcomes typical of standard plate growth. Key benefits of the NemaLife Chip include eliminating the need to perform repeated manual transfers of adults during survival assays, negating the need for progeny-blocking chemical interventions, and avoiding the swim-induced stress across lifespan in animals reared in liquid. We also show that the culture of animals in pillar-less microfluidic chambers reduces lifespan and introduces physiological stress by increasing the occurrence of age-related vulval integrity disorder. We validated our pillar-based device with longevity analyses of classical aging mutants (daf-2, age-1, eat-2, and daf-16) and animals subjected to RNAi knockdown of age-related genes (age-1 and daf-16). We also showed that healthspan measures such as pharyngeal pumping and tap-induced stimulated reversals can be scored across the lifespan in the NemaLife chip. Overall, the capacity to generate reliable lifespan and physiological data underscores the potential of the NemaLife chip to accelerate healthspan and lifespan investigations in C. elegans. Subject terms: Caenorhabditis elegans, Lab-on-a-chip, Ageing",
    "introduction": "Introduction Aging is a significant risk factor for a broad range of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and cancer1–5. With the growing aging population, the socioeconomic burden attributed with age-associated diseases is staggering and development of therapies that promote healthy aging is imperative. C. elegans is a powerful model organism for aging investigations with a short lifespan (3–5 weeks), genetic similarity with humans (~ 38% orthologs6) and conserved signaling pathways7. Additionally, a fully mapped genome8 and genetic plasticity9,10 makes C. elegans an attractive tool for aging studies. Advances in fluorescent microscopy11 and genomic technology (RNAi, CRISPR)12,13 have further expanded the number of possible ways in which C. elegans can be used to study healthy aging. Lifespan analysis has become a widely used method for evaluating the effects of various genes, proteins, and drug compounds on aging and age-associated diseases. In general, lifespan assays are carried out with C. elegans reared on agar plates containing nematode growth media (NGM). During the reproductive phase, adults must be manually transferred to new plates to separate progeny from the original sample. These animal transfers significantly increase the effort and time required for conducting lifespan assays. To reduce the work costs of manual transfers, many labs utilize a strong progeny-blocking drug (2′-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, FUdR) to maintain an adult-only population14–16. An alternative to this approach is the use of sterile mutants17–20. The simplicity of using FUdR or sterile mutants has led to new technologies for large-scale lifespan analysis in C. elegans. A technology known as Lifespan Machine (LSM), allows for the rapid analysis of a population of thousands of animals grown on agar supplemented with FUdR using automatic capture of sequential images to score animal death and determine lifespan21. The LSM technology has provided insights into temporal scaling of ageing dynamics21,22 and helped identify chemical compounds with robust longevity effects23. Similarly, WorMotel technology facilitates longitudinal analysis of individuals in agar-filled microfabricated well plates24. In a recent addition, WormBot technology employed robotic platform to image and measure lifespan of animals cultured on agar surface in a 24-well plate25. Although powerful, LSM, WorMotel, and WormBot technologies have some limitations. The useof FUdR is undesirable as FuDR has been shown to activate stress response pathways26,27, alter body size14, increase superoxide dismutase levels28, increase fat accumulation29 and alter the survival of worms with specific genetic backgrounds27,29,30. Moreover, the timing of FUdR treatment is critical, such that premature supplementation of FUdR results in abnormalities such as a high percentage of vulval protrusion, also known as age-related vulval integrity disorder (AVID)14,15. Another issue with the LSM and WorMotel technologies is the difficulty in studying the effect of temporal changes in environment on lifespan since these require transferring of animals to new plates. Such temporal manipulations have been central to studies of dietary restriction31 and functional cognitive aging32. In addition, uptake of drugs by animals maintained on plates is an ongoing challenge33. In recent years, microfluidic approaches have begun to address the limitations of agar-based lifespan assays34–38. Several key advantages of using PDMS-based microfluidics include (1) excellent permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide, enabling animals to experience natural atmospheric conditions39; (2) size-based separation of animals using on-chip filters34–36, eliminating the need to prevent or reduce progeny production; (3) precise temporal control of culture environment via addition or removal of reagents35,36; (4) overall reduction in the number of censored worms; and (5) optical transparency of devices to enable bright field and fluorescence imaging. Significant advantages of microfluidics has led to the development of lifespan-devices for measuring survival curves34–36,38. However, a major drawback of prior devices is that C. elegans swims in the engineered chambers, similar to liquid cultures in multiwell plates. Physiologically, swimming in liquid culture is more energetically demanding than crawling40,41. In liquid environments, C. elegans can exhibit swimming and quiescent states42, making lifespan outcomes in liquid culture difficult to interpret. Also, housing worms in liquid culture for a significant portion of their lifespan has been shown to induce gene expression changes40,43 and oxidative stress40. Taken together, these findings suggest that conducting whole-life studies in microfluidic chambers where animals swim may not be representative of the physiology that crawling animals experience on plates40,41,44. In addition, measures such as pharyngeal pumping which can be predictive of healthspan45–47 are difficult to score in swimming animals. Given the importance of mimicking plate-like behaviors in microfluidic devices, several studies have incorporated micropillars in microfluidic chambers and showed that the pillar arrangement can be configured to achieve locomotory gait similar to that on agar plates48–52. Additional studies have used these microstructured devices to study chemotactic behaviors50, separate different larval-stage animals53 and perform stress assays54. Thus, micropillar devices are well suited to induce plate-like crawling behaviors; however, to date, whole-life culturing of C. elegans in micropillar environments has not been demonstrated and their suitability for measuring survival curves remains to be ascertained. Here we report an optimized microfluidic device, termed NemaLife Chip, for whole-life studies in C. elegans that addresses the limitations of agar-based approaches and microfluidic swim-chambers. The device has sieve channels to retain adults but enable progeny removal by fluid flow. Since previous micropillar devices have not been configured for life-long culture and survival outcomes, we optimize food concentrations and feeding frequency. Importantly, we show that whole-life culturing of C. elegans in chambers without pillars induces deleterious health effects. Furthermore, we show that the use of a micropillar housing arena increases the efficiency of scoring various health span metrics, including pharyngeal pumping and locomotory phenotypes. Validation of NemaLife chip through the analysis of established aging mutants, RNAi studies, and various culture conditions demonstrates that this new microfluidic device provides a simple platform with the potential to advance our fundamental understanding of genetic and environmental regulators of healthy aging.",

    "results": "Results and discussion Optimization of the NemaLife chip design C. elegans lifespan measurement in a microfluidic environment requires mimicking plate-like behaviors with the capacity to remove progeny. Prior micropillar devices48–50 provide some guidance on construction of environments that can recapitulate plate-like crawling behavior, while lifespan devices with swim chambers35,36 offer some insight into the design of sieve channels. At the same time, configuring micropillar devices for life-long culture with progeny removal and survival analysis requires new design considerations and optimal culture conditions. In this section, we discuss the device design considerations and the optimal micropillar geometry for scoring lifespan and healthspan measures. We then present optimization of cultured conditions in the next section “Optimization of worm culture conditions”. Basic device design We designed the NemaLife culture device (Fig. 1a–d) with design objectives that feature: (1) a micropillar arena that can accommodate the growing body size as young adults are cultured and can enable animals to maintain a crawling gait throughout life; (2) optimal pillar spacing and sieve channel design that allow effective removal of progeny while retaining adults; (3) ports for introducing animals at the beginning of the experiment, washing and feeding animals, and venting air pockets that can form at the inlet during the several weeks that animals are cultured; (4) arena size for housing a population that will be easy to image and score manually while maintaining large enough sample size for meaningful statistical analysis.

Habitat arena is composed of micropillars. Channel at the top (blue arrow) is the worm loading port, the two red arrows on both sides of the device identify the sieve channel that retains worms, two black arrows indicate the reagent exchange ports and the two dashed blue arrows are for purging air pockets. Scale bar 1 mm. (c) An enlarged view of the micropillars and their lattice arrangement. Scale bar 200 µm. (d) The sieve channels consist of rectangular barriers 750 µm × 75 µm separated by a gap of 25–30 µm. Scale bar 200 µm.These criteria were achieved by designing a worm habitat chamber that contains a micropillar lattice (Fig. 1b, c) that allows worms to crawl. Animals are introduced from the worm loading port (blue arrow in Fig. 1b) at the beginning of the lifespan experiment, and this worm loading port is then subsequently sealed with a pin. The inlet port (black arrows in Fig. 1b) is used to wash progeny and introduce E. coli solution to feed the animals. Sieve channels (Fig. 1d) on the sides of the habitat chamber (see red arrows in Fig. 1b), prevent young adults from escaping the arena while allowing efficient passage of eggs, larval-stage animals (L1, L2) and bacterial debris. Adjacent to the sieve channels, two side-ports (see blue dashed arrows in Fig. 1b) act as vents to purge of air pockets that can develop at the inlet of the device during overnight storage in the incubator. During washing/feeding the fluid first passes through the vent port, forcing the air out before the introduced fluid enters the pillar arena. Fluid manipulation is performed manually using hand-held syringes, an aspect of design that we felt would make the device more accessible to use in a wide range of laboratories than would a complex pumping set-up.Micropillar arena design Worm habitat chambers are designed to have an approximate footprint of ≈ 60 mm2 for a population size of 10–15 animals (4–6 mm2 per animal), compared to an average footprint of 2828 mm2 in standard studies on agar for 30–50 animals (60–90 mm2 per animal). We were able to accommodate nine of these chambers on a 50 × 75 mm2 glass slide (Fig. 1a) that could be used to generate survival data on ≈ 100 animals. The geometry of the micropillar lattice in the NemaLife chamber is crucial for successful measurement of lifespan of C. elegans. The lattice structure must accommodate changes in body size during reproduction and aging, maintain the natural crawling gait of C. elegans, and allow non-invasive removal of progeny while retaining the sample population. To identify the optimal micropillar lattice that simultaneously meets these requirements, we fabricated devices with square arrangement of pillars with different pillar diameter (a) and edge-edge gap (s). The nominal dimensions we tested are: Device I, a = 40 μm, s = 60 μm; Device II, a = 50 μm, s = 80 μm and Device III, a = 60 μm, s = 100 μm. The measured dimensions of the three pillar devices are reported in Table S1. During the greatest period of growth, C. elegans body diameter varies from ~ 50 to 100 µm and length varies from ~ 900 to 1500 µm (Fig. S1). Thus, Device I provided the tightest, and Device III the leanest, confinement for the animals during the lifespan measurement. In all the devices, the pillars had a uniform height of ≈ 75 μm and a clearance from the floor of the habitat chamber of approximately ≈ 25 μm, allowing the pillars to be moved aside by the animal to adjust gait and accommodate changes in body size. The gap between the pillars and the clearance between the pillar tip and the floor also helps in size-based separation of the adults from the larvae and eggs. An adult’s body diameter is much larger than the clearance and the animal interacts with approximately 10–16 pillars along its body, which prevents the animal from being washed away during fluid flow. Specifically, animals maintain their posture and crawl normally using the pillar support while the progeny, eggs and other smaller particles are removed via fluid flow.Sieve channel design Our optimized sieve channels have a width of 25–30 μm, length of 750 μm, and are separated from each other by 75 μm × 750 μm rectangular blocks. We designed the length of the rectangular blocks long enough so that the animal cannot generate natural waves and propagate through the channels. In addition, we found that the placement of the sieve channel relative to the pillars is important as animals tend to use the pillars to generate thrust to force themselves through the channel. Placing the sieve channels at a distance of 1000 μm away from the nearest pillar mitigated this behavior and allowed the animal to quickly reverse back to the arena when it approached the sieve channel area.Selection of the optimal micropillar geometry based on locomotion and lifespan outcomes We initially measured the crawling gait in terms of wavelength, amplitude and crawling speed in the three devices for day 4 animals (from hatching). The amplitude and wavelength corresponding to the worm undulatory motion in the three devices were similar (Fig. 2a). However, the crawling speed was diminished in Devices I and II compared to Device III due to their tighter confinement. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Influence of micropillar geometry on animal locomotion and lifespan. (a) Crawling amplitude, wavelength, and speed of day 4 animals as pillar spacing was changed within the three devices (n = 10). Pillar diameter and edge-edge gap for Devices I, II and III are: 40 μm, 60 μm; 50 μm, 80 μm; 60 μm, 100 μm. Older adults are most constrained in Device I and are not constrained in Device III. (b) Wild type C. elegans lifespan as a function of confinement (n = 56 for Device-I, n = 71 for Device-II and n = 60 for Device-III). p value for lifespan curve between Device-I and II is 0.99 and p-value for lifespan curve between Device-I and III is 0.026 (Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, N = 2 repeat trials. Data is shown for one trial.Also of interest is the comparison of data in the test devices to that of animals crawling on agar55. We found that the amplitudes are similar between the two52. However, the wavelength was about 30% higher on agar. Animals do crawl in Device III with a similar speed to animals crawling on agar surfaces55. Thus, among the three devices tested, animals housed in Device III have a locomotory gait that is most similar to that observed on agar plates. We conducted survival experiments in the test devices at the optimal feeding protocol of 100 mg/mL of E. coli OP 50 with animals being fed once a day (see “Optimization of worm culture conditions” section for the feeding optimization study). Figure 2b compares the survival data for the animals reared in the three devices. Devices with tighter pillar spacing resulted in a reduction of worm lifespan, possibly due to restraints in natural locomotion and stress conferred through body confinement. We found that median and maximum lifespan in Device III were most consistent with studies on agar (see “Validation of the NemaLife chip” section) We conducted all subsequent aging investigations using Device III with s = 100 µm.Effect of population density on animal lifespan in the micropillar chamber Population density in each micropillar chamber may limit food availability as well as accumulation of small molecules such as pheromones that help animals sense overcrowding56 and makes them enter into a non-aging dauer-stage57 or extends their lifespan by reducing the insulin signaling58. To investigate the effect of population density, we conducted lifespan experiments in which we varied the number of animals per chamber and manipulated the micropillar chamber size to vary the population density (see Table 1). We maintained the culture in the chamber by daily washing and feeding with 100 mg/mL of E. coli OP50. In Table 1 we compare the median lifespan of animals experiencing population densities ranging from 4.0 to 12 mm2/animal. We note that population density is typically defined as number of animals per unit area, but here we chose the inverse unit to highlight the pillar area needed for chamber design. We find that the median lifespan corresponding to different population densities is not significantly different compared to our standard NemaLife chip condition of 4–6 mm2/animal. This data suggests that in the explored range of animal density, the NemaLife chip does not introduce deleterious effect on animal lifespan. Table 1. Influence of population density and number of animals per chamber on lifespan of wild-type animals. Area (mm2) per animal Animals per chamber Number of trials Animals scored per trial Median lifespan, day Statistical significance 4.0–6.0 10–15 5 86–100 13.6 ± 0.56 – 7.0 1 4 59–91 14.2 ± 0.75 n.s 10–12 60–70 2 60–70 13.5 ± 0.71 n.s Open in a new tab Statistical comparison of survival curves were made with respect to our standard assay condition (highlighted in bold) using log-rank test. p value of > 0.05 corresponds to not significant (n.s.).Additionally, Table 1 shows the lifespan data when an individual animal is housed in the chamber which prevents transmission of the chemical/hormonal signals due to physical isolation. Still, we find that lifespan data from the single-animal chamber is comparable to that of our standard NemaLife chip suggesting that in the explored range of population densities, animal crowding does not have a major influence on lifespan. Recognizing that the population density in the chip is much higher than on plates, we believe that daily washing and supply of fresh food may be the reason that animal density may not be as influential in the chip as it is on plates. Although the different population densities in the chips show comparable lifespan, the live/dead scoring time increases significantly as the population and chamber size increases. Alternatively, having too few animals per chamber will require more chambers to reach an adequate population size for a particular study. We chose to use 10–15 animals per chamber as an optimal trade-off between ease of scoring and achieving a sample size of ≈ 100 animals per assay condition. Optimization of worm culture conditions We established culture maintenance protocols to achieve robust and reproducible lifespan data while increasing the overall efficiency of conducting survival analyses. Initially, we focused on identifying the optimal washing conditions necessary to remove all progeny. To do this, we cultured reproductive adults within the NemaLife device for 24 h to allow progeny production and growth. We then tested progeny removal by delivering 200 µL aliquots of S-complete media via the loading port of the device. Figure 3a, b shows the habitat chamber with adults and their progeny (see SI movie 1). After washing, the retained adults are shown in Fig. 3c. In the event that the animals are already near the exit, sieve channels retain them inside the chamber (Fig. 3d, SI movie 2). We found that all adults were retained, and all progeny were effectively removed using a total wash volume of 1 mL for three different loading conditions (Fig. 3e; SI movie 2). The washing operation took approximately 90 s. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Worm culture in the NemaLife chip with capacity to remove progeny. (a) A typical chamber with wild-type animals and their progeny 24 h after loading. Scale bar 1 mm. To easily visualize progeny, the effect of progeny washing, the images contain about 40 animals, which is almost 3 × the standard count of 10–15 animals per arena. (b) Enlarged view of adult animals, progeny (black arrows) and eggs (red arrows) inside the micropillar arena. Scale bar 200 µm.

(d) Animals at the exit are retained by the sieve channel, Scale bar 1 mm. (e) Effectiveness of progeny removal and adult retention in the NemaLife chip by washing the chambers with S-complete buffer. 16 (red), 32 (blue), and 44 (black) adults (day 3 after hatching) were allowed to reproduce in 3 identical units and synchronization was performed on day 4. Animals were incubated at 20 °C. Open symbols represent adults and closed symbols represent progeny. Adult retention and progeny removal from a single unit is identified with the same color and symbol. N = 3 repeat trials. The device used in efficacy trial for progeny removal has pillars of diameter 40 µm and spacing of 60 µm (Device I).All trials were successful in removing progeny. We washed each chamber and used a stereomicroscope to determine for efficacy of progeny removal. During washing, the progeny that are washed out are eggs and L1 larvae. In case any progeny are left out accidently, these progeny can be L2 (diameter is ~ 25–35 μm) or L3 (diameter is ~ 40 μm) and can still be washed out the next day through the sieve channel of width 25–30 μm. Occasionally when bagging (internal hatching of progeny which can kill the mother) occurred, more repeated washes (2–4 mL) were necessary to remove the progeny of bagged mother or the resulting advanced larval stage progeny. We note that during the washing process, animals in the chamber respond by exhibiting faster crawling momentarily, probably due to the stimulation by fluid forces (see SI movie 2). Next, we sought to establish a robust feeding protocol that provides the worms with an adequate supply of food. E. coli OP50 is widely used as the standard diet for C. elegans cultures. Previous lifespan studies in multi-well plates16,59 and pillar-less microfluidic devices34,36 used a bacterial concentration of 109–1010 bacterial cells per mL of S-medium and added the bacterial suspension to the microfluidic devices either continuously36 or once a day34. In our study, we used the bacterial concentration from previous studies as a starting point to optimize the feeding protocol and evaluate the lifespan. The feeding conditions we tested include 100 mg/mL E. coli OP50 once a day, twice a day, or every other day, where 100 mg/mL E. coli OP50 was found to be equivalent to ≈ 2.4 × 1011 colony forming units (cfu)/mL. In addition, we also increased food by testing 200 mg/mL E. coli OP50 once a day. We note that the microfluidic chamber can hold ≈ 6.75 μL and ≈ 250 μL of food volume was injected into the device, indicating there was no significant food dilution occurring in the chamber. We find that worms fed every other day at 100 mg mL−1 had an overall extension in maximum lifespan but a significant decrease in median lifespan as well as a high death rate during reproduction (Fig. 4a). Alternatively, we noted that feeding twice per day did not significantly alter lifespan (Fig. 4a) or age-dependent changes in body size (see SI Fig. S1). Figure 4b shows that animals fed once a day at 100 mg/mL or 200 mg/mL had similar survival curves suggesting that feeding 100 mg/mL daily is sufficient for measuring survival curves. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Optimization of feeding protocol for C. elegans lifespan assays. (a) Lifespan of wild type C. elegans for feeding frequency of twice per day (n = 112), once per day (n = 87) and every other day (n = 92). N = 2 repeat trials. Food concentration: 100 mg/mL of E. coli OP50 in S-complete. (b) Lifespan of wild type C. elegans for food concentration of 100 mg/mL (n = 87) and 200 mg/mL (n = 74) of E.coli OP50 in S-complete. N = 1 trial. Feeding frequency: once every day. Feeding animals every other day, produces a lower median (and mean) and higher maximal lifespan than feeding every day (p = 0.0036) or twice per day (p < 0.001). p value (once per day vs twice per day) = 0.0244.Next, we assessed whether the animals might become dietary restricted when supplied with a daily dose of 100 mg/mL bacterial solution. We measured the density of the bacterial solution at the end of a feeding cycle by collecting the washed fluid from each NemaLife chip. Each chip had 9–14 animals and 8 chips were used as replicates. Figure 5 shows the residual bacterial density measured daily during the reproductive period, starting from day 3 until day 7, to account for the consumption of bacteria from hatched progeny. We found that the bacterial density dropped significantly after day 3 and remained approximately the same (≈ 1.5 × 1011 cfu/mL) during the rest of reproductive period. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Residual food concentration after a cycle of incubation during reproductive period. Consumption of bacteria by the adult and their progeny over 24 h’ time (once per day feeding) based on measuring left-over bacteria in the device. Dashed horizontal line represents the daily food concentration, equivalent to 100 mg/mL, provided to the animals each day. Day 3 is the day of loading animals into the chip at age 60–65 h from hatching (day 1 adult). Sample size = 8 chamber/day and 9–14 animals in each chamber. Error bar is the standard error.Dietary restriction has been shown to occur on plates at bacterial densities of 1 × 108 cfu/mL31. The food levels remaining after daily feeding are substantially above the dietary restriction levels even during the peak reproductive period when adults are consuming significantly more and hatched progeny also contribute to the depletion of food sources60. Thus, we conclude that a diet of 100 mg/mL E. coli OP50, added once daily, is sufficient for whole-life culture of C. elegans in the NemaLife chip. Whole-life C. elegans studies in pillar-less microfluidic chambers Previous microfluidic works focusing on lifespan measurement in C. elegans used chambers without pillars34–38. In these pillar-less microfluidic devices, animals experience swim-induced physiological stress, potentially affecting lifespan and healthspan outcomes. To clarify the potential impact of life-long swimming, we used the same overall design of NemaLife chip but without the pillars in the arena. We used the optimized washing and feeding protocol and conducted in parallel whole-life studies in the pillar-less and pillar-equipped chips. Specifically, for animals cultured in both environments, we measured survival curves and scored for the age-related vulval integrity disorder (avid) phenotype as a measure of physiological health. Comparing the progeny-washing process between devices with and without pillars, we found that in the pillar-less chip, progeny removal is challenging and requires additional wash steps since the animals accumulate at the sieve channels blocking the flow of fluid (see SI movie 3). Thus, additional washes were needed to ensure removal of progeny in pillar-less chips. Another important distinction is that although animals in the pillar-equipped NemaLife chip crawled naturally (Fig. 6a, i), many animals in the pillar-less chip were found to assume a stiff (black arrow in Fig. 6a, ii) and stationary posture as well as show occasional coiling behavior (red arrow in Fig. 6a, ii). These unnatural body postures in pillar-less microfluidics chambers suggest that animals suffer from swim-induced fatigue40,42. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Lifespan and healthspan outcomes due to whole-life culture in pillar-less microfluidic chambers (a) (i) A representative snapshot of wild type C. elegans (day 5) crawling in a micropillar environment exhibiting typical postures. (ii) Snapshot of wild type animal swimming in the pillarless chamber. Black arrow shows a fatigued animal and red arrow shows a coiled animal. Animal age: day 5. (b) Lifespan of crawling versus swimming wild type C. elegans at 20 °C (p < 0.001). N = 2 trials, data is shown for one trial. Sample size in pillar-less and micropillar environment is 97 and 95 respectively. (c) A day 8 C. elegans with age-related vulval integrity disorder (avid) shown in a dashed red circle. Enlarged view is in the inset. (d) Percentage of animals showing avid phenotype in the pillar-laden (crawling) and pillar-less (swimming) devices.In Fig. 6b, we show the survival curves for animals in both the pillar-free and pillar equipped environments. The median lifespan of animals cultured in the pillar-less environment was 11 days compared to 14 days in the pillar environment. However, maximum lifespan was similar for the two populations. Thus, animals experiencing swim-induced physiological stress have shorter mean lifespan. The larger death rate during early reproductive period in the pillar-less chip is due to animals showing age-related vulval integrity disorder (avid). Avid is characterized by vulval protrusion and expulsion of intestinal fluid or tissues (see Fig. 6c) which has been shown to increase with hypoxic stress, decreasing temperature, and poor reproductive health61. In the pillar-laden chips, we observed the first instances of avid after the reproductive period, which is consistent with studies on plates61. However, we find that worms cultured in the pillar-less chambers experience avid as early as day 4 and avid occurs more frequently compared to animals in the pillar-environment (Fig. 6d). In sum, the reduced lifespan and the frequent occurrence of the avid phenotype in the swim-chambers observed in the absence of pillars, suggest that the pillar environment of the NemaLife chip is crucial for mitigating stress during life-long liquid culture of C. elegans. Validation of the NemaLife chip Next, we discuss studies that were conducted in the NemaLife chip to validate our microfluidic approach for lifespan measurement in C. elegans. Specifically, (1) we compared the lifespan data for animals cultured in our microfluidic devices versus those maintained on agar plates, (2) we compared the stress induced in the NemaLife chip to that on agar plates, (3) we measured lifespan of mutants with known aging pathways, and (4) we tested efficacy of RNAi interventions in the device. The lifespan data corresponding to all these conditions is included in Table S2 in the Supplementary Information. Comparison of C. elegans lifespan in device and on agar To evaluate if our optimized NemaLife device generates C. elegans lifespan data consistent with that of standard agar plate assays we conducted parallel lifespan analysis of young adults using established protocols. Figure 7a shows that housing worms in the NemaLife chip does not significantly alter lifespan (p > 0.11). The median and maximum lifespan from three replicates on agar were 15.67 ± 0.58 and 24.33 ± 0.58 days respectively. Likewise, the median and maximum lifespan in the microfluidic device were 16.0 ± 0.0 and 24.67 ± 2.08 days, respectively. Here, the maximum lifespan is taken as the day before the last animal of a population is dead. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Lifespan measured in the NemaLife device is similar to that animals reared on agar plates: (a) Lifespan of wild type C. elegans evaluated on agar plates and in the microfluidic pillar device. Thin solid lines represent independent trials and the thick solid line represents the combined lifespan of the trials. Lifespan evaluated in microfluidic device is consistent with the agar plate assay (p = 0.11 for trial-1; p = 0.13 for trial-2 and p = 0.22 for trial-3, log rank test) at 20 °C. Sample size in agar/microfluidic device—trial-1: 109/81; trial-2: 159/135; and trial-3: 70/112. (b) Lifespan of a transgenic strain TJ356 with a Pdaf-16::GFP stress reporter on agar plates and in the microfluidic device (p = 0.16, log rank test). Sample size is 71/112 (agar/microfluidic device) at 20 °C. N = 2 trials, data is shown for one trial. (c) Fluorescent imaging of DAF-16::GFP nuclear localization of live worm in the microfluidic device. (i) no sign of accumulation in a day 3 (from hatching) when freshly loaded into the device from agar plate at 20 °C, (ii) and (iii) are images of 8-day old animal (from hatching) on agar plate and in microfluidic device at 20 °C respectively (Insets show zoomed-in fluorescence images), and (iv) number of visible puncta in animals cultured in agar plate (n = 5, day 8 animals) and in NemaLife chip (n = 10, day 8 animals) (p = 0.65, unpaired t test).Although we find that the lifespan curves are in good agreement between NemaLife chip and agar assays, we find that the NemaLife chip offers considerably less animal loss during a survival assay. On agar, we found 5–30% animal loss over the course of the assay. It is common to lose animals on agar plates due to (1) crawling up along the side wall and death from desiccation, (2) burrowing into the soft agar which precludes scoring, and (3) bagging. Animal loss due to desiccation and burrowing depends on the type of strain, sex, mutation, and intervention used, and sometimes may account for as much as 50% of the total animal population62. As death events due to desiccation and burrowing cannot be scored, whether agar-based lifespan is a measure of a selected subset of a population becomes a question. Moreover, loss of animals increases the number of worms needed to initiate each experiment as loss must be anticipated. We found that the NemaLife chip eliminates the incidences of animal loss from desiccation and burrowing due to culture in an enclosed microfluidic chamber. We observed a 0–6% animal loss, which could be attributed to washing mistakes (human error of not plugging the loading port, which lacks a sieve channel, or of excess pressure application for fluid flow such that animals close to the sieve channel squeeze out). Animal loss/censoring from bagging was 1–6% in the NemaLife chip compared to about 2–10% on agar plates in this study. We also evaluated whether the NemaLife chip induces environmental stresses such as starvation in the animals. We chose a strain that expresses the stress reporter DAF-16::GFP63, which exhibits DAF-16 nuclear localization under caloric restriction, heat, and oxidative stresses64–66. We first determined that the strain harboring this reporter (TJ356) exhibited similar lifespan on both agar plates and in the microfluidic device, indicating that culture in the liquid environment of the microfluidic pillar device does not induce deleterious effects on TJ356 survival (Fig. 7b, see additional trial data in SI Fig. S2). We then performed fluorescence imaging to assess DAF-16 localization. In the device at 20 °C, day 3 and day 8 animals, or on agar at day 8, animals did not exhibit such DAF-16::GFP localization (images in Fig. 7c-i, ii, iii). We quantified the visible puncta in day 8 animals cultured on agar plates and in microfluidic chambers and found no significant difference (Fig. 7c-iv). Thus, although animals cultured in our microfluidic device can induce stress responses similar to those cultured on agar, the standard growth conditions we use do not elicit daf-16-dependent translocation to the nucleus. Over the course of the study, we conducted 20 separate lifespan assays of WT worms in the NemaLife chip (see SI Fig. S3), allowing us to account for seasonal changes in laboratory environments. We found that variation in lifespan is limited to 13%, a level of replicate variation comparable to that found in lifespan assays conducted in LSM technolology62.Lifespan studies using mutants and RNAi interventions To further test our NemaLife device, we sought to replicate phenotypes of well characterized long-lived and short-lived mutants. As a starting point, we chose established long-lived genetic mutants: insulin signaling mutants daf-2(e1370) (insulin receptor reduction of function mutation67), age-1(hx546) (phosphatidylinositol-3-OH (PI3) kinase reduction of function mutation68) and eating-impaired dietary restriction mutant eat-2(ad1116)69. We also tested the short-lived, insulin signaling mutant, daf-16(mgDf50), which lacks the FOXO transcription factor homolog70,71. Consistent with previous reports, daf-2, eat-2 and age-1 mutants exhibited robust extension of lifespan (Fig. 8a, b). For this data set, daf-2, age-1, eat-2, and wild-type shows a 100%, 64.2%, and 15.4% increase in median lifespan in the microfluidic pillar environment, respectively (Fig. 8a, b). For daf-16 mutants, in Fig. 8a we did not observe a statistically significant difference, but we observed a significant decline in the trial shown in Fig. 8b and an additional trial shown in Table S2. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Mutant and RNAi testing in the NemaLife device. (a) Lifespan of long-lived mutants daf-16(mgDf50), daf-2(e1370) and age-1(hx546). N = 2 trials, data is shown for one trial. n = 160, 152, 168, 128 for daf-2, age-1, daf-16 and wild type animals respectively. (b) Lifespan extension of eat-2(ad1116) establishes NemaLife chip for its suitability to carry out dietary restriction experiments. N = 1 trial. n = 123, 84, 86 for eat-2, daf-16 and wild type animals respectively. (c) RNAi efficacy establishes the ability of the lifespan device to capture the on-chip genetic modification. For RNAi efficacy fragments targeting daf-16 and age-1 were inserted into feeding vector L4440. Wild type C. elegans of day 3 were used in the experiment. N = 3 trials, data is shown for one trial. n = 88, 135, 116 for PL4440, daf-16 and age-1 animals respectively. Food: 100 mg E. coli OP50/mL in S complete, feeding frequency: once/day.We note that the maximum lifespan of daf-2 is 44 days, which demonstrates that the microfluidic culture environment can adequately support long duration longevity studies in C. elegans. We have also successfully measured lifespan of mutants with locomotory defects in the NemaLife chip indicating that fluid stress due to daily washing/feeding and our death scoring protocol does not elicit undesirable outcomes (Fig. S4). We conclude that NemaLife chip can both support long term culture of C. elegans and yield longevity outcomes that parallel those reported on agar plates. We also tested whether genetic screens using RNAi can be pursued in the NemaLife device. In C. elegans targeted post-transcriptional RNA knockdown can be achieved by feeding animals bacteria that harbor clones expressing specific double stranded RNAs72,73. We found a 15.4% extension and a 15.4% reduction in median lifespan of worms fed RNAi targeting age-1 and daf-16, respectively, when compared to worms fed an empty vector (PL4440) as a control (Fig. 8c). Likewise in terms of maximum lifespan, we found a 25% extension and a 8% reduction in age-1 and daf-16 respectively. RNAi efficacy in the NemaLife chambers establishes that food adequate to elicit the RNAi-mediated silencing of the targeted gene is ingested by the animal, addressing a potential concern on the efficacy of RNAi intervention in the microfluidic environment. Scoring healthspan measures in C. elegans In addition to lifespan measurement, the transparency and shallow depth of the PDMS worm-habitat chamber offer the opportunity to evaluate physiological characteristics and fluorescent biomarkers of healthspan in C. elegans. In this study, we focused on manual scoring of pharyngeal pumping and stimulus-induced forward and reversal speed. The ability to score such phenotypes across lifespan demonstrates the capacity of NemaLife as a device for healthy aging investigations in C. elegans. Pharyngeal pumping The pharynx of C. elegans is a heart-like organ that uses rhythmic contraction and relaxation to facilitate bacterial uptake74. Pharyngeal pumping rates depend on several factors, such as food availability and environmental quality, and significantly decline with age, making pumping evaluation an attractive physiological marker for evaluating C. elegans health status45,47. Lockery et al.46 developed a microfluidic device to measure pumping rates by recording the electrical activity of the pharynx while the animal is immobilized. Scholz et al. reported an image-based pharyngeal pumping measurement technique in which the movement of the grinder of an immobilized worm in a microfluidic device (WormSpa75) is tracked76. However, in both cases, the microfluidic devices are specifically designed to immobilize animals of a given body size, and as a result these approaches are not conducive for whole-life culture and recording pharyngeal pumping measurements across the lifespan of the animal. Likewise, in prior pillar-less microfluidic devices in which animals swim continuously, it is difficult to record pharyngeal pumping due to 3D motion. Using our NemaLife platform, we confirmed previous reports of age-dependent reduction of pharyngeal pumping in wild-type C. elegans (Fig. 9, see Movies S4, S5). Additionally, we observe temporal changes in pharyngeal pumping rates throughout various life stages. In animals maintained within NemaLife, we report that pharyngeal pumping rates increase up to the end of the reproductive period, reaching a maximum of ≈ 283 cycles/min on day 8. Pumping rates decrease gradually starting from day 10, reaching ≈ 117 cycles/min on day 20, at which point, degeneration of the pharynx makes it difficult to score pumping frequency. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Age-associated decline in pharyngeal pumping rate as measured in the NemaLife chip. Pharyngeal pumping in cycles per minute for wild type C. elegans over the course of its lifespan (n = 10 at each time point). Error bar is the standard deviation. Food: 100 mg E. coli OP50/mL S complete, feeding frequency: once/day. Inset shows the pharynx of an animal inside a chamber.Maximum pharyngeal pumping rates we observed are similar to that reported on agar45, however, the rate of age-dependent decline in the pharyngeal pumping was relatively slow in the microfluidic device compared to agar. Old animals (day 15) grown on agar exhibited a significant reduction in pharyngeal pumping rate (20–30 cycles/min45,47) while animals housed in the microfluidic device maintain a relatively high pharyngeal pumping rate (150–160 cycles/min) in late life. Studies show that C. elegans increases rate of pharyngeal pumping with food concentrations in liquid environments76–78. It is possible that the abundance of high-quality food even after reproduction makes the decline less pronounced. It is also possible that less bacterial biofilm is formed in the microfluidic environment and therefore animals are less prone to bacterial colonization in the pharynx. Nevertheless, it is clear that the age-associated pumping rate decline can be monitored using the NemaLife chip. The high pharyngeal pumping rate in the NemaLife chip may be advantageous for enhanced uptake of compounds in pharmacological assays.Stimulated locomotion Locomotory vigor is commonly used as a healthspan measure in C. elegans45,47,79. Forward crawling of C. elegans is accompanied by pauses and reversals at a speed and frequency that are dependent upon food availability and the crawling environment. As a result, temporal fluctuations in locomotion make it difficult to evaluate true crawling speed. Extended tracking and long-term analysis of time-lapse images are required to properly assess forward locomotion dynamics. Reversals are observed during natural locomotion and are important for escape in response to gentle touch, a behavior in which the worm quickly reverses and suppresses head movement80–83. Spontaneous reversals are usually short episodes between consecutive forward crawling bouts. Reversal behavior is thus an indicator of neuro-muscular function82 that can be scored reliably in a short observation time. On agar plates, reversals are induced by applying gentle touch to the animal with an eyelash or by prodding the worm with a platinum pick or by simply tapping the plate80,84. Here, we replicate the gentle touch stimulus in the microfluidic device with a hex key to induce stimulated reversals. We induced reversals mechanically by gentle tapping on the top surface of the device 3 times at a location slightly away from the worm pharynx. Stimulus is transferred to the worm as mechanical vibration through the pillar and the fluid. This stimulus-induced locomotory response cannot be evaluated in prior pillar-less microfluidic devices because it is difficult for the animals to exhibit reversals in a fully liquid environment. Thus, the tap-induced reversal is unique to the NemaLife chip. Stimulated responses generally involve an initial reversal (first reversal), a change in direction, followed by a final forward movement (Fig. 10a). In nearly all cases, we observed that animals immediately respond to a tap by exhibiting a first reversal followed by a turn. Occasionally, we observed brief interruptions in forward crawling motion that appeared to be independent of the stimulus. Inset of Fig. 10a shows the average speed calculated from the different modes of crawling. As expected, the first reversal showed the highest speed. Figure 10. Open in a new tab Stimulated reversal speed and age-associated locomotory decline in wild-type C. elegans. (a) A representative locomotion episode of a day-5 C. elegans over 40 s duration. Each filled circle represents instantaneous speed between two consecutive frames determined by manually tracking the vulva of the animal. Tap stimulus was applied (frame # 10, red arrow) to induce reversal. Animal executed reversal with a very high speed followed by second reversal. Animal turns (blue arrow), crawls in forward direction (black brackets) for relatively long time with pause (amber bracket). Naturally occurring reversal period is shown by the pink bracket. Average speed of the full episode, only forward (including pauses), only reversal and stimulated reversal are shown in the inset. Error bars are standard deviations. n = 5. (b) Decline in forward and first reversal speed as wild type C. elegans ages in the micropillar arena. Error bar is the standard deviation. n > 10, food: 100 mg E. coli OP50/mL S complete, feeding frequency: once/day.Using the NemaLife chip, we show that both reversal and forward speed vary significantly with age and we find that reversal speed is always greater than forward speed in worms of all ages (Fig. 10b). Most importantly, the rate of decline in reversal speed is accelerated at the end of reproduction. More specifically, between day 8 and day 12, the reversal speed measure is 50% reduced, whereas stimulated forward speed is only 17% reduced. Interestingly, the decline in the stimulated reversal speed is correlated with an equally rapid decline in survival rates following the reproductive period, an observation that underscores the importance of expanding lifespan assays to include the evaluation of additional health span metrics. Overall, the NemaLife chip enables measurement of stimulated reversal speed as a novel biomarker for aging and healthspan, which couples with other health measures to establish a powerful platform for analysis of C. elegans healthspan and lifespan. Assessment of throughput of NemaLife chip In this study, we developed NemaLife chip for life-long culture of C. elegans focusing on lifespan assays. Standard lifespan assays on NGM plates involve manual steps of animal transfers and scoring animal deaths. The operational protocol for NemaLife chips also involves manual steps of washing, feeding and scoring for live/dead animals. Therefore, it is useful to evaluate the throughput of conducting lifespan assays with the NemaLife chip. To estimate the labor time taken for conducting a lifespan assay with NemaLife chip and plates, we considered a sample size of 100 animals and the maximum lifespan as 4 weeks. This sample size approximately corresponds to one NemaLife chip (9 chambers × 10–15 animals per chamber) or 4 NGM plates (4 plates × 30 animals per plate). Table 2 shows the estimated labor time when the assay is conducted on NGM plates or NemaLife chip. Table 2. Estimates of labor time needed for conducting a lifespan assay on NGM plates and NemaLife chip. NGM plates NemaLife chip Tasks Animal transfers Scoring live/dead Progeny washing Animal feeding Scoring live/dead Daily labor time 20–40 min (5–10 min per plate × 4 plates) 12–20 min (3–5 min per plate × 4 plates) 9 min (1 min per chamber × 9 chambers) 3 min (20 s per chamber × 9 chambers) 5 min (0.5 min per chamber × 9 chambers) Total person hours 15—28 h (32–60 min per day × 28 days) 7.9 h (17 min per day × 28 days) Open in a new tab The sample size for the estimation is taken to be 100 animals and the maximum lifespan as 4 weeks. Note that for lifespan assays in both NGM plates and the Nemalife Chip, the scoring time decreases in later days as animals die.Overall, we find that a lifespan assay takes about 2X–4X less labor time with NemaLife chip than on plates. The significant savings in time come from eliminating manual picking of animals as well as from scoring. In the NemaLife chip, progeny washing is done by a hand-syringe (connected with a tubing and a pin) allowing the user to wash one chamber and move to the next. The scoring in NemaLife chip also takes less time since the population of 100 animals is compartmentalized into 9 smaller chambers with fewer animals compared to plates. On NGM plates, animals explore a larger footprint and with a limited field of view which requires searching. In addition, death events can be problematic to score in translucent agar, whereas on the chip the transparency of PDMS, narrow chamber height and cleaner background reduces the time required to score. In Table 2, we have only listed the labor time for conducting the assay, but we did not consider the preparation time which includes making plates or chips, obtaining synchronized animals, growing bacteria and storing plates or chips in incubators. The preparation time for animal and bacteria culture are similar for the two approaches, however, the preparation time for NGM plates may be longer than the NemaLife chips since a single chip is required for a full lifespan assay while 15–20 NGM plates are required depending on the frequency of animal transfers. In general, other considerations such as device failure, contamination, and clogging can affect the throughput of NemaLife chip. During the course of this study, we used 33 chips for lifespan assays and only 11 out of 247 chambers (4.45% chambers) failed during the experiment. The failure is due to human errors such as forgetting to block the worm loading port with a solid pin which causes animals to escape during washing/feeding, or adding ethanol accidentally in one chamber. Despite these inadvertent errors, we were still able to obtain experimental data since the chip has 9 chambers and censoring of one or two chambers provides meaningful data although at a reduced sample size. We did not observe any major failure of NemaLife chambers due to clogging. The NemaLife chambers are designed symmetrically with respect to inlet and outlet. Our protocol involved using each port alternatively and thus keeping the sieve channels free of clogging. In addition, contamination of chips was not observed due to pre-sterilization of chambers prior to experimentation and also because the enclosed chamber minimizes exposure of the small amount of culture fluid (≈ 6.75 μL) to ambient environment. Finally, we note that the NemaLife chips cannot be reused for lifespan as the chambers accumulate chemicals and bacterial residue over the lifespan assay potentially influencing aging biology and lifespan of C. elegans if chips are re-used.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions We demonstrated that C. elegans can be effectively maintained in our NemaLife microfluidic device across its lifespan without using chemicals (progeny-blocking drugs, antibacterial agents, antifungal compounds, etc.) in an environment that recapitulates longevity on agar plates. The closed microfluidic environment keeps animals inside the arena boundary and eliminates the events of death by desiccation. Being fully occupied with fluid, the culture environment maintains uniform humidity and minimizes temperature fluctuations. Micropillars in the microfluidic device enable the animals to maintain natural crawling gaits and eliminate swim-induced stress. The well characterized survival outcomes of “cornerstone” longevity mutants with altered insulin-like signaling or dietary restriction pathways grown on agar are reproduced in the device; RNAi can also be executed. The capacity for manual injections of fluids and food enables investigator control over feeding conditions or introduced drugs. For compound testing, the liquid environment in the NemaLife chip ensures the uniform availability of the compound which is difficult to ensure in agar-filled plates. In the NemaLife chip, we replace the old environment (larva, eggs, 24 h old bacteria and buffer, pheromones, excrete etc.) daily with fresh food. As a result, animals can be exposed to a fresh dose of compounds daily, similar to dosing schedules with mammalian models. An added benefit of the device is that progeny and effluent (containing any chemicals such as, pheromones etc.) might be collected for downstream analysis. The NemaLife chip was also designed to improve the scoring of live/dead animals. The microfluidic chip consists of 9 smaller chambers on a 2\" × 3\" glass slide. Small footprint of an individual chamber is entirely visible at 10 × or 20 × magnification on a stereomicroscope. Each chamber was optimized to house 10–15 animals so that one can score animal surival easily. Thus, we achieve a large enough sample size for drawing meaningful statistical inferences without employing a computer vision system and complicated imaging system otherwise required for a larger chamber. These considerations make the NemaLife chip easily implementable in research labs conducting lifespan assays and investigator scoring options provide quality control on data. In sum, the NemaLife chip is a simple and low-cost means to obtain reliable lifespan and physiological data on aging animals. The NemaLife chip can be developed into a fully automated platform, that can offer progeny removal, feeding, drug delivery, and phenotypic scoring using automated pump systems and an appropriate software. Thus, the NemaLife chip has a significant potential both as a low-cost “manual” device that can be used in many labs and as a core component of a fully automated platform.",

Copyright notice ID: 7530743 PMID: 33004810 Abstract In this study, we report a microfluidic device for the whole-life culture of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the scoring of animal survival and health measures. This device referred to as the NemaLife chip features: (1) an optimized micropillar arena in which animals can crawl, (2) sieve channels that separate progeny and prevent the loss of adults from the arena during culture maintenance, and (3) ports that allow rapid accessibility for feeding the adult-only population and introducing reagents as needed. The pillar arena geometry was optimized to accommodate the growing body size during culture and emulate the body gait and locomotion of animals reared on agar. Likewise, feeding protocols were optimized to recapitulate longevity outcomes typical of standard plate growth. Key benefits of the NemaLife Chip include eliminating the need to perform repeated manual transfers of adults during survival assays, negating the need for progeny-blocking chemical interventions, and avoiding the swim-induced stress across lifespan in animals reared in liquid. We also show that the culture of animals in pillar-less microfluidic chambers reduces lifespan and introduces physiological stress by increasing the occurrence of age-related vulval integrity disorder. We validated our pillar-based device with longevity analyses of classical aging mutants (daf-2, age-1, eat-2, and daf-16) and animals subjected to RNAi knockdown of age-related genes (age-1 and daf-16). We also showed that healthspan measures such as pharyngeal pumping and tap-induced stimulated reversals can be scored across the lifespan in the NemaLife chip. Overall, the capacity to generate reliable lifespan and physiological data underscores the potential of the NemaLife chip to accelerate healthspan and lifespan investigations in C. elegans. Subject terms: Caenorhabditis elegans, Lab-on-a-chip, AgeingIntroduction Aging is a significant risk factor for a broad range of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and cancer1–5. With the growing aging population, the socioeconomic burden attributed with age-associated diseases is staggering and development of therapies that promote healthy aging is imperative. C. elegans is a powerful model organism for aging investigations with a short lifespan (3–5 weeks), genetic similarity with humans (~ 38% orthologs6) and conserved signaling pathways7. Additionally, a fully mapped genome8 and genetic plasticity9,10 makes C. elegans an attractive tool for aging studies. Advances in fluorescent microscopy11 and genomic technology (RNAi, CRISPR)12,13 have further expanded the number of possible ways in which C. elegans can be used to study healthy aging. Lifespan analysis has become a widely used method for evaluating the effects of various genes, proteins, and drug compounds on aging and age-associated diseases. In general, lifespan assays are carried out with C. elegans reared on agar plates containing nematode growth media (NGM). During the reproductive phase, adults must be manually transferred to new plates to separate progeny from the original sample. These animal transfers significantly increase the effort and time required for conducting lifespan assays. To reduce the work costs of manual transfers, many labs utilize a strong progeny-blocking drug (2′-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, FUdR) to maintain an adult-only population14–16. An alternative to this approach is the use of sterile mutants17–20. The simplicity of using FUdR or sterile mutants has led to new technologies for large-scale lifespan analysis in C. elegans. A technology known as Lifespan Machine (LSM), allows for the rapid analysis of a population of thousands of animals grown on agar supplemented with FUdR using automatic capture of sequential images to score animal death and determine lifespan21. The LSM technology has provided insights into temporal scaling of ageing dynamics21,22 and helped identify chemical compounds with robust longevity effects23. Similarly, WorMotel technology facilitates longitudinal analysis of individuals in agar-filled microfabricated well plates24. In a recent addition, WormBot technology employed robotic platform to image and measure lifespan of animals cultured on agar surface in a 24-well plate25. Although powerful, LSM, WorMotel, and WormBot technologies have some limitations. The useof FUdR is undesirable as FuDR has been shown to activate stress response pathways26,27, alter body size14, increase superoxide dismutase levels28, increase fat accumulation29 and alter the survival of worms with specific genetic backgrounds27,29,30. Moreover, the timing of FUdR treatment is critical, such that premature supplementation of FUdR results in abnormalities such as a high percentage of vulval protrusion, also known as age-related vulval integrity disorder (AVID)14,15. Another issue with the LSM and WorMotel technologies is the difficulty in studying the effect of temporal changes in environment on lifespan since these require transferring of animals to new plates. Such temporal manipulations have been central to studies of dietary restriction31 and functional cognitive aging32. In addition, uptake of drugs by animals maintained on plates is an ongoing challenge33. In recent years, microfluidic approaches have begun to address the limitations of agar-based lifespan assays34–38. Several key advantages of using PDMS-based microfluidics include (1) excellent permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide, enabling animals to experience natural atmospheric conditions39; (2) size-based separation of animals using on-chip filters34–36, eliminating the need to prevent or reduce progeny production; (3) precise temporal control of culture environment via addition or removal of reagents35,36; (4) overall reduction in the number of censored worms; and (5) optical transparency of devices to enable bright field and fluorescence imaging. Significant advantages of microfluidics has led to the development of lifespan-devices for measuring survival curves34–36,38. However, a major drawback of prior devices is that C. elegans swims in the engineered chambers, similar to liquid cultures in multiwell plates. Physiologically, swimming in liquid culture is more energetically demanding than crawling40,41. In liquid environments, C. elegans can exhibit swimming and quiescent states42, making lifespan outcomes in liquid culture difficult to interpret. Also, housing worms in liquid culture for a significant portion of their lifespan has been shown to induce gene expression changes40,43 and oxidative stress40. Taken together, these findings suggest that conducting whole-life studies in microfluidic chambers where animals swim may not be representative of the physiology that crawling animals experience on plates40,41,44. In addition, measures such as pharyngeal pumping which can be predictive of healthspan45–47 are difficult to score in swimming animals. Given the importance of mimicking plate-like behaviors in microfluidic devices, several studies have incorporated micropillars in microfluidic chambers and showed that the pillar arrangement can be configured to achieve locomotory gait similar to that on agar plates48–52. Additional studies have used these microstructured devices to study chemotactic behaviors50, separate different larval-stage animals53 and perform stress assays54. Thus, micropillar devices are well suited to induce plate-like crawling behaviors; however, to date, whole-life culturing of C. elegans in micropillar environments has not been demonstrated and their suitability for measuring survival curves remains to be ascertained. Here we report an optimized microfluidic device, termed NemaLife Chip, for whole-life studies in C. elegans that addresses the limitations of agar-based approaches and microfluidic swim-chambers. The device has sieve channels to retain adults but enable progeny removal by fluid flow. Since previous micropillar devices have not been configured for life-long culture and survival outcomes, we optimize food concentrations and feeding frequency. Importantly, we show that whole-life culturing of C. elegans in chambers without pillars induces deleterious health effects. Furthermore, we show that the use of a micropillar housing arena increases the efficiency of scoring various health span metrics, including pharyngeal pumping and locomotory phenotypes. Validation of NemaLife chip through the analysis of established aging mutants, RNAi studies, and various culture conditions demonstrates that this new microfluidic device provides a simple platform with the potential to advance our fundamental understanding of genetic and environmental regulators of healthy aging.Results and discussion Optimization of the NemaLife chip design C. elegans lifespan measurement in a microfluidic environment requires mimicking plate-like behaviors with the capacity to remove progeny. Prior micropillar devices48–50 provide some guidance on construction of environments that can recapitulate plate-like crawling behavior, while lifespan devices with swim chambers35,36 offer some insight into the design of sieve channels. At the same time, configuring micropillar devices for life-long culture with progeny removal and survival analysis requires new design considerations and optimal culture conditions. In this section, we discuss the device design considerations and the optimal micropillar geometry for scoring lifespan and healthspan measures. We then present optimization of cultured conditions in the next section “Optimization of worm culture conditions”. Basic device design We designed the NemaLife culture device (Fig. 1a–d) with design objectives that feature: (1) a micropillar arena that can accommodate the growing body size as young adults are cultured and can enable animals to maintain a crawling gait throughout life; (2) optimal pillar spacing and sieve channel design that allow effective removal of progeny while retaining adults; (3) ports for introducing animals at the beginning of the experiment, washing and feeding animals, and venting air pockets that can form at the inlet during the several weeks that animals are cultured; (4) arena size for housing a population that will be easy to image and score manually while maintaining large enough sample size for meaningful statistical analysis.

Scale bar 1 mm. (c) An enlarged view of the micropillars and their lattice arrangement. Scale bar 200 µm. (d) The sieve channels consist of rectangular barriers 750 µm × 75 µm separated by a gap of 25–30 µm. Scale bar 200 µm.These criteria were achieved by designing a worm habitat chamber that contains a micropillar lattice (Fig. 1b, c) that allows worms to crawl. Animals are introduced from the worm loading port (blue arrow in Fig. 1b) at the beginning of the lifespan experiment, and this worm loading port is then subsequently sealed with a pin. The inlet port (black arrows in Fig. 1b) is used to wash progeny and introduce E. coli solution to feed the animals. Sieve channels (Fig. 1d) on the sides of the habitat chamber (see red arrows in Fig. 1b), prevent young adults from escaping the arena while allowing efficient passage of eggs, larval-stage animals (L1, L2) and bacterial debris. Adjacent to the sieve channels, two side-ports (see blue dashed arrows in Fig. 1b) act as vents to purge of air pockets that can develop at the inlet of the device during overnight storage in the incubator. During washing/feeding the fluid first passes through the vent port, forcing the air out before the introduced fluid enters the pillar arena. Fluid manipulation is performed manually using hand-held syringes, an aspect of design that we felt would make the device more accessible to use in a wide range of laboratories than would a complex pumping set-up.Micropillar arena design Worm habitat chambers are designed to have an approximate footprint of ≈ 60 mm2 for a population size of 10–15 animals (4–6 mm2 per animal), compared to an average footprint of 2828 mm2 in standard studies on agar for 30–50 animals (60–90 mm2 per animal). We were able to accommodate nine of these chambers on a 50 × 75 mm2 glass slide (Fig. 1a) that could be used to generate survival data on ≈ 100 animals. The geometry of the micropillar lattice in the NemaLife chamber is crucial for successful measurement of lifespan of C. elegans. The lattice structure must accommodate changes in body size during reproduction and aging, maintain the natural crawling gait of C. elegans, and allow non-invasive removal of progeny while retaining the sample population. To identify the optimal micropillar lattice that simultaneously meets these requirements, we fabricated devices with square arrangement of pillars with different pillar diameter (a) and edge-edge gap (s). The nominal dimensions we tested are: Device I, a = 40 μm, s = 60 μm; Device II, a = 50 μm, s = 80 μm and Device III, a = 60 μm, s = 100 μm. The measured dimensions of the three pillar devices are reported in Table S1. During the greatest period of growth, C. elegans body diameter varies from ~ 50 to 100 µm and length varies from ~ 900 to 1500 µm (Fig. S1). Thus, Device I provided the tightest, and Device III the leanest, confinement for the animals during the lifespan measurement. In all the devices, the pillars had a uniform height of ≈ 75 μm and a clearance from the floor of the habitat chamber of approximately ≈ 25 μm, allowing the pillars to be moved aside by the animal to adjust gait and accommodate changes in body size. The gap between the pillars and the clearance between the pillar tip and the floor also helps in size-based separation of the adults from the larvae and eggs. An adult’s body diameter is much larger than the clearance and the animal interacts with approximately 10–16 pillars along its body, which prevents the animal from being washed away during fluid flow. Specifically, animals maintain their posture and crawl normally using the pillar support while the progeny, eggs and other smaller particles are removed via fluid flow.Sieve channel design Our optimized sieve channels have a width of 25–30 μm, length of 750 μm, and are separated from each other by 75 μm × 750 μm rectangular blocks. We designed the length of the rectangular blocks long enough so that the animal cannot generate natural waves and propagate through the channels. In addition, we found that the placement of the sieve channel relative to the pillars is important as animals tend to use the pillars to generate thrust to force themselves through the channel. Placing the sieve channels at a distance of 1000 μm away from the nearest pillar mitigated this behavior and allowed the animal to quickly reverse back to the arena when it approached the sieve channel area.Selection of the optimal micropillar geometry based on locomotion and lifespan outcomes We initially measured the crawling gait in terms of wavelength, amplitude and crawling speed in the three devices for day 4 animals (from hatching). The amplitude and wavelength corresponding to the worm undulatory motion in the three devices were similar (Fig. 2a). However, the crawling speed was diminished in Devices I and II compared to Device III due to their tighter confinement. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Influence of micropillar geometry on animal locomotion and lifespan. (a) Crawling amplitude, wavelength, and speed of day 4 animals as pillar spacing was changed within the three devices (n = 10). Pillar diameter and edge-edge gap for Devices I, II and III are: 40 μm, 60 μm; 50 μm, 80 μm; 60 μm, 100 μm. Older adults are most constrained in Device I and are not constrained in Device III. (b) Wild type C. elegans lifespan as a function of confinement (n = 56 for Device-I, n = 71 for Device-II and n = 60 for Device-III). p value for lifespan curve between Device-I and II is 0.99 and p-value for lifespan curve between Device-I and III is 0.026 (Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, N = 2 repeat trials. Data is shown for one trial.Also of interest is the comparison of data in the test devices to that of animals crawling on agar55. We found that the amplitudes are similar between the two52. However, the wavelength was about 30% higher on agar. Animals do crawl in Device III with a similar speed to animals crawling on agar surfaces55. Thus, among the three devices tested, animals housed in Device III have a locomotory gait that is most similar to that observed on agar plates. We conducted survival experiments in the test devices at the optimal feeding protocol of 100 mg/mL of E. coli OP 50 with animals being fed once a day (see “Optimization of worm culture conditions” section for the feeding optimization study). Figure 2b compares the survival data for the animals reared in the three devices. Devices with tighter pillar spacing resulted in a reduction of worm lifespan, possibly due to restraints in natural locomotion and stress conferred through body confinement. We found that median and maximum lifespan in Device III were most consistent with studies on agar (see “Validation of the NemaLife chip” section) We conducted all subsequent aging investigations using Device III with s = 100 µm.Effect of population density on animal lifespan in the micropillar chamber Population density in each micropillar chamber may limit food availability as well as accumulation of small molecules such as pheromones that help animals sense overcrowding56 and makes them enter into a non-aging dauer-stage57 or extends their lifespan by reducing the insulin signaling58. To investigate the effect of population density, we conducted lifespan experiments in which we varied the number of animals per chamber and manipulated the micropillar chamber size to vary the population density (see Table 1). We maintained the culture in the chamber by daily washing and feeding with 100 mg/mL of E. coli OP50. In Table 1 we compare the median lifespan of animals experiencing population densities ranging from 4.0 to 12 mm2/animal. We note that population density is typically defined as number of animals per unit area, but here we chose the inverse unit to highlight the pillar area needed for chamber design. We find that the median lifespan corresponding to different population densities is not significantly different compared to our standard NemaLife chip condition of 4–6 mm2/animal. This data suggests that in the explored range of animal density, the NemaLife chip does not introduce deleterious effect on animal lifespan. Table 1. Influence of population density and number of animals per chamber on lifespan of wild-type animals. Area (mm2) per animal Animals per chamber Number of trials Animals scored per trial Median lifespan, day Statistical significance 4.0–6.0 10–15 5 86–100 13.6 ± 0.56 – 7.0 1 4 59–91 14.2 ± 0.75 n.s 10–12 60–70 2 60–70 13.5 ± 0.71 n.s Open in a new tab Statistical comparison of survival curves were made with respect to our standard assay condition (highlighted in bold) using log-rank test. p value of > 0.05 corresponds to not significant (n.s.).Additionally, Table 1 shows the lifespan data when an individual animal is housed in the chamber which prevents transmission of the chemical/hormonal signals due to physical isolation. Still, we find that lifespan data from the single-animal chamber is comparable to that of our standard NemaLife chip suggesting that in the explored range of population densities, animal crowding does not have a major influence on lifespan. Recognizing that the population density in the chip is much higher than on plates, we believe that daily washing and supply of fresh food may be the reason that animal density may not be as influential in the chip as it is on plates. Although the different population densities in the chips show comparable lifespan, the live/dead scoring time increases significantly as the population and chamber size increases. Alternatively, having too few animals per chamber will require more chambers to reach an adequate population size for a particular study. We chose to use 10–15 animals per chamber as an optimal trade-off between ease of scoring and achieving a sample size of ≈ 100 animals per assay condition.Optimization of worm culture conditions We established culture maintenance protocols to achieve robust and reproducible lifespan data while increasing the overall efficiency of conducting survival analyses. Initially, we focused on identifying the optimal washing conditions necessary to remove all progeny. To do this, we cultured reproductive adults within the NemaLife device for 24 h to allow progeny production and growth. We then tested progeny removal by delivering 200 µL aliquots of S-complete media via the loading port of the device. Figure 3a, b shows the habitat chamber with adults and their progeny (see SI movie 1). After washing, the retained adults are shown in Fig. 3c. In the event that the animals are already near the exit, sieve channels retain them inside the chamber (Fig. 3d, SI movie 2). We found that all adults were retained, and all progeny were effectively removed using a total wash volume of 1 mL for three different loading conditions (Fig. 3e; SI movie 2). The washing operation took approximately 90 s. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Worm culture in the NemaLife chip with capacity to remove progeny. (a) A typical chamber with wild-type animals and their progeny 24 h after loading. Scale bar 1 mm. To easily visualize progeny, the effect of progeny washing, the images contain about 40 animals, which is almost 3 × the standard count of 10–15 animals per arena. (b) Enlarged view of adult animals, progeny (black arrows) and eggs (red arrows) inside the micropillar arena. Scale bar 200 µm.

(d) Animals at the exit are retained by the sieve channel, Scale bar 1 mm. (e) Effectiveness of progeny removal and adult retention in the NemaLife chip by washing the chambers with S-complete buffer. 16 (red), 32 (blue), and 44 (black) adults (day 3 after hatching) were allowed to reproduce in 3 identical units and synchronization was performed on day 4. Animals were incubated at 20 °C. Open symbols represent adults and closed symbols represent progeny. Adult retention and progeny removal from a single unit is identified with the same color and symbol. N = 3 repeat trials. The device used in efficacy trial for progeny removal has pillars of diameter 40 µm and spacing of 60 µm (Device I).All trials were successful in removing progeny. We washed each chamber and used a stereomicroscope to determine for efficacy of progeny removal. During washing, the progeny that are washed out are eggs and L1 larvae. In case any progeny are left out accidently, these progeny can be L2 (diameter is ~ 25–35 μm) or L3 (diameter is ~ 40 μm) and can still be washed out the next day through the sieve channel of width 25–30 μm. Occasionally when bagging (internal hatching of progeny which can kill the mother) occurred, more repeated washes (2–4 mL) were necessary to remove the progeny of bagged mother or the resulting advanced larval stage progeny. We note that during the washing process, animals in the chamber respond by exhibiting faster crawling momentarily, probably due to the stimulation by fluid forces (see SI movie 2). Next, we sought to establish a robust feeding protocol that provides the worms with an adequate supply of food. E. coli OP50 is widely used as the standard diet for C. elegans cultures. Previous lifespan studies in multi-well plates16,59 and pillar-less microfluidic devices34,36 used a bacterial concentration of 109–1010 bacterial cells per mL of S-medium and added the bacterial suspension to the microfluidic devices either continuously36 or once a day34. In our study, we used the bacterial concentration from previous studies as a starting point to optimize the feeding protocol and evaluate the lifespan. The feeding conditions we tested include 100 mg/mL E. coli OP50 once a day, twice a day, or every other day, where 100 mg/mL E. coli OP50 was found to be equivalent to ≈ 2.4 × 1011 colony forming units (cfu)/mL. In addition, we also increased food by testing 200 mg/mL E. coli OP50 once a day. We note that the microfluidic chamber can hold ≈ 6.75 μL and ≈ 250 μL of food volume was injected into the device, indicating there was no significant food dilution occurring in the chamber. We find that worms fed every other day at 100 mg mL−1 had an overall extension in maximum lifespan but a significant decrease in median lifespan as well as a high death rate during reproduction (Fig. 4a). Alternatively, we noted that feeding twice per day did not significantly alter lifespan (Fig. 4a) or age-dependent changes in body size (see SI Fig. S1). Figure 4b shows that animals fed once a day at 100 mg/mL or 200 mg/mL had similar survival curves suggesting that feeding 100 mg/mL daily is sufficient for measuring survival curves. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Optimization of feeding protocol for C. elegans lifespan assays. (a) Lifespan of wild type C. elegans for feeding frequency of twice per day (n = 112), once per day (n = 87) and every other day (n = 92). N = 2 repeat trials. Food concentration: 100 mg/mL of E. coli OP50 in S-complete. (b) Lifespan of wild type C. elegans for food concentration of 100 mg/mL (n = 87) and 200 mg/mL (n = 74) of E.coli OP50 in S-complete. N = 1 trial. Feeding frequency: once every day. Feeding animals every other day, produces a lower median (and mean) and higher maximal lifespan than feeding every day (p = 0.0036) or twice per day (p < 0.001). p value (once per day vs twice per day) = 0.0244.Next, we assessed whether the animals might become dietary restricted when supplied with a daily dose of 100 mg/mL bacterial solution. We measured the density of the bacterial solution at the end of a feeding cycle by collecting the washed fluid from each NemaLife chip. Each chip had 9–14 animals and 8 chips were used as replicates. Figure 5 shows the residual bacterial density measured daily during the reproductive period, starting from day 3 until day 7, to account for the consumption of bacteria from hatched progeny. We found that the bacterial density dropped significantly after day 3 and remained approximately the same (≈ 1.5 × 1011 cfu/mL) during the rest of reproductive period. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Residual food concentration after a cycle of incubation during reproductive period. Consumption of bacteria by the adult and their progeny over 24 h’ time (once per day feeding) based on measuring left-over bacteria in the device. Dashed horizontal line represents the daily food concentration, equivalent to 100 mg/mL, provided to the animals each day. Day 3 is the day of loading animals into the chip at age 60–65 h from hatching (day 1 adult). Sample size = 8 chamber/day and 9–14 animals in each chamber. Error bar is the standard error.Dietary restriction has been shown to occur on plates at bacterial densities of 1 × 108 cfu/mL31. The food levels remaining after daily feeding are substantially above the dietary restriction levels even during the peak reproductive period when adults are consuming significantly more and hatched progeny also contribute to the depletion of food sources60. Thus, we conclude that a diet of 100 mg/mL E. coli OP50, added once daily, is sufficient for whole-life culture of C. elegans in the NemaLife chip.Whole-life C. elegans studies in pillar-less microfluidic chambers Previous microfluidic works focusing on lifespan measurement in C. elegans used chambers without pillars34–38. In these pillar-less microfluidic devices, animals experience swim-induced physiological stress, potentially affecting lifespan and healthspan outcomes. To clarify the potential impact of life-long swimming, we used the same overall design of NemaLife chip but without the pillars in the arena. We used the optimized washing and feeding protocol and conducted in parallel whole-life studies in the pillar-less and pillar-equipped chips. Specifically, for animals cultured in both environments, we measured survival curves and scored for the age-related vulval integrity disorder (avid) phenotype as a measure of physiological health. Comparing the progeny-washing process between devices with and without pillars, we found that in the pillar-less chip, progeny removal is challenging and requires additional wash steps since the animals accumulate at the sieve channels blocking the flow of fluid (see SI movie 3). Thus, additional washes were needed to ensure removal of progeny in pillar-less chips. Another important distinction is that although animals in the pillar-equipped NemaLife chip crawled naturally (Fig. 6a, i), many animals in the pillar-less chip were found to assume a stiff (black arrow in Fig. 6a, ii) and stationary posture as well as show occasional coiling behavior (red arrow in Fig. 6a, ii). These unnatural body postures in pillar-less microfluidics chambers suggest that animals suffer from swim-induced fatigue40,42. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Lifespan and healthspan outcomes due to whole-life culture in pillar-less microfluidic chambers (a) (i) A representative snapshot of wild type C. elegans (day 5) crawling in a micropillar environment exhibiting typical postures. (ii) Snapshot of wild type animal swimming in the pillarless chamber. Black arrow shows a fatigued animal and red arrow shows a coiled animal. Animal age: day 5. (b) Lifespan of crawling versus swimming wild type C. elegans at 20 °C (p < 0.001). N = 2 trials, data is shown for one trial. Sample size in pillar-less and micropillar environment is 97 and 95 respectively. (c) A day 8 C. elegans with age-related vulval integrity disorder (avid) shown in a dashed red circle. Enlarged view is in the inset. (d) Percentage of animals showing avid phenotype in the pillar-laden (crawling) and pillar-less (swimming) devices.In Fig. 6b, we show the survival curves for animals in both the pillar-free and pillar equipped environments. The median lifespan of animals cultured in the pillar-less environment was 11 days compared to 14 days in the pillar environment. However, maximum lifespan was similar for the two populations. Thus, animals experiencing swim-induced physiological stress have shorter mean lifespan. The larger death rate during early reproductive period in the pillar-less chip is due to animals showing age-related vulval integrity disorder (avid). Avid is characterized by vulval protrusion and expulsion of intestinal fluid or tissues (see Fig. 6c) which has been shown to increase with hypoxic stress, decreasing temperature, and poor reproductive health61. In the pillar-laden chips, we observed the first instances of avid after the reproductive period, which is consistent with studies on plates61. However, we find that worms cultured in the pillar-less chambers experience avid as early as day 4 and avid occurs more frequently compared to animals in the pillar-environment (Fig. 6d). In sum, the reduced lifespan and the frequent occurrence of the avid phenotype in the swim-chambers observed in the absence of pillars, suggest that the pillar environment of the NemaLife chip is crucial for mitigating stress during life-long liquid culture of C. elegans.Validation of the NemaLife chip Next, we discuss studies that were conducted in the NemaLife chip to validate our microfluidic approach for lifespan measurement in C. elegans. Specifically, (1) we compared the lifespan data for animals cultured in our microfluidic devices versus those maintained on agar plates, (2) we compared the stress induced in the NemaLife chip to that on agar plates, (3) we measured lifespan of mutants with known aging pathways, and (4) we tested efficacy of RNAi interventions in the device. The lifespan data corresponding to all these conditions is included in Table S2 in the Supplementary Information. Comparison of C. elegans lifespan in device and on agar To evaluate if our optimized NemaLife device generates C. elegans lifespan data consistent with that of standard agar plate assays we conducted parallel lifespan analysis of young adults using established protocols. Figure 7a shows that housing worms in the NemaLife chip does not significantly alter lifespan (p > 0.11). The median and maximum lifespan from three replicates on agar were 15.67 ± 0.58 and 24.33 ± 0.58 days respectively. Likewise, the median and maximum lifespan in the microfluidic device were 16.0 ± 0.0 and 24.67 ± 2.08 days, respectively. Here, the maximum lifespan is taken as the day before the last animal of a population is dead. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Lifespan measured in the NemaLife device is similar to that animals reared on agar plates: (a) Lifespan of wild type C. elegans evaluated on agar plates and in the microfluidic pillar device. Thin solid lines represent independent trials and the thick solid line represents the combined lifespan of the trials. Lifespan evaluated in microfluidic device is consistent with the agar plate assay (p = 0.11 for trial-1; p = 0.13 for trial-2 and p = 0.22 for trial-3, log rank test) at 20 °C. Sample size in agar/microfluidic device—trial-1: 109/81; trial-2: 159/135; and trial-3: 70/112. (b) Lifespan of a transgenic strain TJ356 with a Pdaf-16::GFP stress reporter on agar plates and in the microfluidic device (p = 0.16, log rank test). Sample size is 71/112 (agar/microfluidic device) at 20 °C. N = 2 trials, data is shown for one trial. (c) Fluorescent imaging of DAF-16::GFP nuclear localization of live worm in the microfluidic device. (i) no sign of accumulation in a day 3 (from hatching) when freshly loaded into the device from agar plate at 20 °C, (ii) and (iii) are images of 8-day old animal (from hatching) on agar plate and in microfluidic device at 20 °C respectively (Insets show zoomed-in fluorescence images), and (iv) number of visible puncta in animals cultured in agar plate (n = 5, day 8 animals) and in NemaLife chip (n = 10, day 8 animals) (p = 0.65, unpaired t test).Although we find that the lifespan curves are in good agreement between NemaLife chip and agar assays, we find that the NemaLife chip offers considerably less animal loss during a survival assay. On agar, we found 5–30% animal loss over the course of the assay. It is common to lose animals on agar plates due to (1) crawling up along the side wall and death from desiccation, (2) burrowing into the soft agar which precludes scoring, and (3) bagging. Animal loss due to desiccation and burrowing depends on the type of strain, sex, mutation, and intervention used, and sometimes may account for as much as 50% of the total animal population62. As death events due to desiccation and burrowing cannot be scored, whether agar-based lifespan is a measure of a selected subset of a population becomes a question. Moreover, loss of animals increases the number of worms needed to initiate each experiment as loss must be anticipated. We found that the NemaLife chip eliminates the incidences of animal loss from desiccation and burrowing due to culture in an enclosed microfluidic chamber. We observed a 0–6% animal loss, which could be attributed to washing mistakes (human error of not plugging the loading port, which lacks a sieve channel, or of excess pressure application for fluid flow such that animals close to the sieve channel squeeze out). Animal loss/censoring from bagging was 1–6% in the NemaLife chip compared to about 2–10% on agar plates in this study. We also evaluated whether the NemaLife chip induces environmental stresses such as starvation in the animals. We chose a strain that expresses the stress reporter DAF-16::GFP63, which exhibits DAF-16 nuclear localization under caloric restriction, heat, and oxidative stresses64–66. We first determined that the strain harboring this reporter (TJ356) exhibited similar lifespan on both agar plates and in the microfluidic device, indicating that culture in the liquid environment of the microfluidic pillar device does not induce deleterious effects on TJ356 survival (Fig. 7b, see additional trial data in SI Fig. S2). We then performed fluorescence imaging to assess DAF-16 localization. In the device at 20 °C, day 3 and day 8 animals, or on agar at day 8, animals did not exhibit such DAF-16::GFP localization (images in Fig. 7c-i, ii, iii). We quantified the visible puncta in day 8 animals cultured on agar plates and in microfluidic chambers and found no significant difference (Fig. 7c-iv). Thus, although animals cultured in our microfluidic device can induce stress responses similar to those cultured on agar, the standard growth conditions we use do not elicit daf-16-dependent translocation to the nucleus. Over the course of the study, we conducted 20 separate lifespan assays of WT worms in the NemaLife chip (see SI Fig. S3), allowing us to account for seasonal changes in laboratory environments. We found that variation in lifespan is limited to 13%, a level of replicate variation comparable to that found in lifespan assays conducted in LSM technolology62.Lifespan studies using mutants and RNAi interventions To further test our NemaLife device, we sought to replicate phenotypes of well characterized long-lived and short-lived mutants. As a starting point, we chose established long-lived genetic mutants: insulin signaling mutants daf-2(e1370) (insulin receptor reduction of function mutation67), age-1(hx546) (phosphatidylinositol-3-OH (PI3) kinase reduction of function mutation68) and eating-impaired dietary restriction mutant eat-2(ad1116)69. We also tested the short-lived, insulin signaling mutant, daf-16(mgDf50), which lacks the FOXO transcription factor homolog70,71. Consistent with previous reports, daf-2, eat-2 and age-1 mutants exhibited robust extension of lifespan (Fig. 8a, b). For this data set, daf-2, age-1, eat-2, and wild-type shows a 100%, 64.2%, and 15.4% increase in median lifespan in the microfluidic pillar environment, respectively (Fig. 8a, b). For daf-16 mutants, in Fig. 8a we did not observe a statistically significant difference, but we observed a significant decline in the trial shown in Fig. 8b and an additional trial shown in Table S2. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Mutant and RNAi testing in the NemaLife device. (a) Lifespan of long-lived mutants daf-16(mgDf50), daf-2(e1370) and age-1(hx546). N = 2 trials, data is shown for one trial. n = 160, 152, 168, 128 for daf-2, age-1, daf-16 and wild type animals respectively. (b) Lifespan extension of eat-2(ad1116) establishes NemaLife chip for its suitability to carry out dietary restriction experiments. N = 1 trial. n = 123, 84, 86 for eat-2, daf-16 and wild type animals respectively. (c) RNAi efficacy establishes the ability of the lifespan device to capture the on-chip genetic modification. For RNAi efficacy fragments targeting daf-16 and age-1 were inserted into feeding vector L4440. Wild type C. elegans of day 3 were used in the experiment. N = 3 trials, data is shown for one trial. n = 88, 135, 116 for PL4440, daf-16 and age-1 animals respectively. Food: 100 mg E. coli OP50/mL in S complete, feeding frequency: once/day.We note that the maximum lifespan of daf-2 is 44 days, which demonstrates that the microfluidic culture environment can adequately support long duration longevity studies in C. elegans. We have also successfully measured lifespan of mutants with locomotory defects in the NemaLife chip indicating that fluid stress due to daily washing/feeding and our death scoring protocol does not elicit undesirable outcomes (Fig. S4). We conclude that NemaLife chip can both support long term culture of C. elegans and yield longevity outcomes that parallel those reported on agar plates. We also tested whether genetic screens using RNAi can be pursued in the NemaLife device. In C. elegans targeted post-transcriptional RNA knockdown can be achieved by feeding animals bacteria that harbor clones expressing specific double stranded RNAs72,73. We found a 15.4% extension and a 15.4% reduction in median lifespan of worms fed RNAi targeting age-1 and daf-16, respectively, when compared to worms fed an empty vector (PL4440) as a control (Fig. 8c). Likewise in terms of maximum lifespan, we found a 25% extension and a 8% reduction in age-1 and daf-16 respectively. RNAi efficacy in the NemaLife chambers establishes that food adequate to elicit the RNAi-mediated silencing of the targeted gene is ingested by the animal, addressing a potential concern on the efficacy of RNAi intervention in the microfluidic environment.Scoring healthspan measures in C. elegans In addition to lifespan measurement, the transparency and shallow depth of the PDMS worm-habitat chamber offer the opportunity to evaluate physiological characteristics and fluorescent biomarkers of healthspan in C. elegans. In this study, we focused on manual scoring of pharyngeal pumping and stimulus-induced forward and reversal speed. The ability to score such phenotypes across lifespan demonstrates the capacity of NemaLife as a device for healthy aging investigations in C. elegans. Pharyngeal pumping The pharynx of C. elegans is a heart-like organ that uses rhythmic contraction and relaxation to facilitate bacterial uptake74. Pharyngeal pumping rates depend on several factors, such as food availability and environmental quality, and significantly decline with age, making pumping evaluation an attractive physiological marker for evaluating C. elegans health status45,47. Lockery et al.46 developed a microfluidic device to measure pumping rates by recording the electrical activity of the pharynx while the animal is immobilized. Scholz et al. reported an image-based pharyngeal pumping measurement technique in which the movement of the grinder of an immobilized worm in a microfluidic device (WormSpa75) is tracked76. However, in both cases, the microfluidic devices are specifically designed to immobilize animals of a given body size, and as a result these approaches are not conducive for whole-life culture and recording pharyngeal pumping measurements across the lifespan of the animal. Likewise, in prior pillar-less microfluidic devices in which animals swim continuously, it is difficult to record pharyngeal pumping due to 3D motion. Using our NemaLife platform, we confirmed previous reports of age-dependent reduction of pharyngeal pumping in wild-type C. elegans (Fig. 9, see Movies S4, S5). Additionally, we observe temporal changes in pharyngeal pumping rates throughout various life stages. In animals maintained within NemaLife, we report that pharyngeal pumping rates increase up to the end of the reproductive period, reaching a maximum of ≈ 283 cycles/min on day 8. Pumping rates decrease gradually starting from day 10, reaching ≈ 117 cycles/min on day 20, at which point, degeneration of the pharynx makes it difficult to score pumping frequency. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Age-associated decline in pharyngeal pumping rate as measured in the NemaLife chip. Pharyngeal pumping in cycles per minute for wild type C. elegans over the course of its lifespan (n = 10 at each time point). Error bar is the standard deviation. Food: 100 mg E. coli OP50/mL S complete, feeding frequency: once/day. Inset shows the pharynx of an animal inside a chamber.Maximum pharyngeal pumping rates we observed are similar to that reported on agar45, however, the rate of age-dependent decline in the pharyngeal pumping was relatively slow in the microfluidic device compared to agar. Old animals (day 15) grown on agar exhibited a significant reduction in pharyngeal pumping rate (20–30 cycles/min45,47) while animals housed in the microfluidic device maintain a relatively high pharyngeal pumping rate (150–160 cycles/min) in late life. Studies show that C. elegans increases rate of pharyngeal pumping with food concentrations in liquid environments76–78. It is possible that the abundance of high-quality food even after reproduction makes the decline less pronounced. It is also possible that less bacterial biofilm is formed in the microfluidic environment and therefore animals are less prone to bacterial colonization in the pharynx. Nevertheless, it is clear that the age-associated pumping rate decline can be monitored using the NemaLife chip. The high pharyngeal pumping rate in the NemaLife chip may be advantageous for enhanced uptake of compounds in pharmacological assays.Stimulated locomotion Locomotory vigor is commonly used as a healthspan measure in C. elegans45,47,79. Forward crawling of C. elegans is accompanied by pauses and reversals at a speed and frequency that are dependent upon food availability and the crawling environment. As a result, temporal fluctuations in locomotion make it difficult to evaluate true crawling speed. Extended tracking and long-term analysis of time-lapse images are required to properly assess forward locomotion dynamics. Reversals are observed during natural locomotion and are important for escape in response to gentle touch, a behavior in which the worm quickly reverses and suppresses head movement80–83. Spontaneous reversals are usually short episodes between consecutive forward crawling bouts. Reversal behavior is thus an indicator of neuro-muscular function82 that can be scored reliably in a short observation time. On agar plates, reversals are induced by applying gentle touch to the animal with an eyelash or by prodding the worm with a platinum pick or by simply tapping the plate80,84. Here, we replicate the gentle touch stimulus in the microfluidic device with a hex key to induce stimulated reversals. We induced reversals mechanically by gentle tapping on the top surface of the device 3 times at a location slightly away from the worm pharynx. Stimulus is transferred to the worm as mechanical vibration through the pillar and the fluid. This stimulus-induced locomotory response cannot be evaluated in prior pillar-less microfluidic devices because it is difficult for the animals to exhibit reversals in a fully liquid environment. Thus, the tap-induced reversal is unique to the NemaLife chip. Stimulated responses generally involve an initial reversal (first reversal), a change in direction, followed by a final forward movement (Fig. 10a). In nearly all cases, we observed that animals immediately respond to a tap by exhibiting a first reversal followed by a turn. Occasionally, we observed brief interruptions in forward crawling motion that appeared to be independent of the stimulus. Inset of Fig. 10a shows the average speed calculated from the different modes of crawling. As expected, the first reversal showed the highest speed. Figure 10. Open in a new tab Stimulated reversal speed and age-associated locomotory decline in wild-type C. elegans. (a) A representative locomotion episode of a day-5 C. elegans over 40 s duration. Each filled circle represents instantaneous speed between two consecutive frames determined by manually tracking the vulva of the animal. Tap stimulus was applied (frame # 10, red arrow) to induce reversal. Animal executed reversal with a very high speed followed by second reversal. Animal turns (blue arrow), crawls in forward direction (black brackets) for relatively long time with pause (amber bracket). Naturally occurring reversal period is shown by the pink bracket. Average speed of the full episode, only forward (including pauses), only reversal and stimulated reversal are shown in the inset. Error bars are standard deviations. n = 5. (b) Decline in forward and first reversal speed as wild type C. elegans ages in the micropillar arena. Error bar is the standard deviation. n > 10, food: 100 mg E. coli OP50/mL S complete, feeding frequency: once/day.Using the NemaLife chip, we show that both reversal and forward speed vary significantly with age and we find that reversal speed is always greater than forward speed in worms of all ages (Fig. 10b). Most importantly, the rate of decline in reversal speed is accelerated at the end of reproduction. More specifically, between day 8 and day 12, the reversal speed measure is 50% reduced, whereas stimulated forward speed is only 17% reduced. Interestingly, the decline in the stimulated reversal speed is correlated with an equally rapid decline in survival rates following the reproductive period, an observation that underscores the importance of expanding lifespan assays to include the evaluation of additional health span metrics. Overall, the NemaLife chip enables measurement of stimulated reversal speed as a novel biomarker for aging and healthspan, which couples with other health measures to establish a powerful platform for analysis of C. elegans healthspan and lifespan.Assessment of throughput of NemaLife chip In this study, we developed NemaLife chip for life-long culture of C. elegans focusing on lifespan assays. Standard lifespan assays on NGM plates involve manual steps of animal transfers and scoring animal deaths. The operational protocol for NemaLife chips also involves manual steps of washing, feeding and scoring for live/dead animals. Therefore, it is useful to evaluate the throughput of conducting lifespan assays with the NemaLife chip. To estimate the labor time taken for conducting a lifespan assay with NemaLife chip and plates, we considered a sample size of 100 animals and the maximum lifespan as 4 weeks. This sample size approximately corresponds to one NemaLife chip (9 chambers × 10–15 animals per chamber) or 4 NGM plates (4 plates × 30 animals per plate). Table 2 shows the estimated labor time when the assay is conducted on NGM plates or NemaLife chip. Table 2. Estimates of labor time needed for conducting a lifespan assay on NGM plates and NemaLife chip. NGM plates NemaLife chip Tasks Animal transfers Scoring live/dead Progeny washing Animal feeding Scoring live/dead Daily labor time 20–40 min (5–10 min per plate × 4 plates) 12–20 min (3–5 min per plate × 4 plates) 9 min (1 min per chamber × 9 chambers) 3 min (20 s per chamber × 9 chambers) 5 min (0.5 min per chamber × 9 chambers) Total person hours 15—28 h (32–60 min per day × 28 days) 7.9 h (17 min per day × 28 days) Open in a new tab The sample size for the estimation is taken to be 100 animals and the maximum lifespan as 4 weeks. Note that for lifespan assays in both NGM plates and the Nemalife Chip, the scoring time decreases in later days as animals die.Overall, we find that a lifespan assay takes about 2X–4X less labor time with NemaLife chip than on plates. The significant savings in time come from eliminating manual picking of animals as well as from scoring. In the NemaLife chip, progeny washing is done by a hand-syringe (connected with a tubing and a pin) allowing the user to wash one chamber and move to the next. The scoring in NemaLife chip also takes less time since the population of 100 animals is compartmentalized into 9 smaller chambers with fewer animals compared to plates. On NGM plates, animals explore a larger footprint and with a limited field of view which requires searching. In addition, death events can be problematic to score in translucent agar, whereas on the chip the transparency of PDMS, narrow chamber height and cleaner background reduces the time required to score. In Table 2, we have only listed the labor time for conducting the assay, but we did not consider the preparation time which includes making plates or chips, obtaining synchronized animals, growing bacteria and storing plates or chips in incubators. The preparation time for animal and bacteria culture are similar for the two approaches, however, the preparation time for NGM plates may be longer than the NemaLife chips since a single chip is required for a full lifespan assay while 15–20 NGM plates are required depending on the frequency of animal transfers. In general, other considerations such as device failure, contamination, and clogging can affect the throughput of NemaLife chip. During the course of this study, we used 33 chips for lifespan assays and only 11 out of 247 chambers (4.45% chambers) failed during the experiment. The failure is due to human errors such as forgetting to block the worm loading port with a solid pin which causes animals to escape during washing/feeding, or adding ethanol accidentally in one chamber. Despite these inadvertent errors, we were still able to obtain experimental data since the chip has 9 chambers and censoring of one or two chambers provides meaningful data although at a reduced sample size. We did not observe any major failure of NemaLife chambers due to clogging. The NemaLife chambers are designed symmetrically with respect to inlet and outlet. Our protocol involved using each port alternatively and thus keeping the sieve channels free of clogging. In addition, contamination of chips was not observed due to pre-sterilization of chambers prior to experimentation and also because the enclosed chamber minimizes exposure of the small amount of culture fluid (≈ 6.75 μL) to ambient environment. Finally, we note that the NemaLife chips cannot be reused for lifespan as the chambers accumulate chemicals and bacterial residue over the lifespan assay potentially influencing aging biology and lifespan of C. elegans if chips are re-used.Conclusions We demonstrated that C. elegans can be effectively maintained in our NemaLife microfluidic device across its lifespan without using chemicals (progeny-blocking drugs, antibacterial agents, antifungal compounds, etc.) in an environment that recapitulates longevity on agar plates. The closed microfluidic environment keeps animals inside the arena boundary and eliminates the events of death by desiccation. Being fully occupied with fluid, the culture environment maintains uniform humidity and minimizes temperature fluctuations. Micropillars in the microfluidic device enable the animals to maintain natural crawling gaits and eliminate swim-induced stress. The well characterized survival outcomes of “cornerstone” longevity mutants with altered insulin-like signaling or dietary restriction pathways grown on agar are reproduced in the device; RNAi can also be executed. The capacity for manual injections of fluids and food enables investigator control over feeding conditions or introduced drugs. For compound testing, the liquid environment in the NemaLife chip ensures the uniform availability of the compound which is difficult to ensure in agar-filled plates. In the NemaLife chip, we replace the old environment (larva, eggs, 24 h old bacteria and buffer, pheromones, excrete etc.) daily with fresh food. As a result, animals can be exposed to a fresh dose of compounds daily, similar to dosing schedules with mammalian models. An added benefit of the device is that progeny and effluent (containing any chemicals such as, pheromones etc.) might be collected for downstream analysis. The NemaLife chip was also designed to improve the scoring of live/dead animals. The microfluidic chip consists of 9 smaller chambers on a 2\" × 3\" glass slide. Small footprint of an individual chamber is entirely visible at 10 × or 20 × magnification on a stereomicroscope. Each chamber was optimized to house 10–15 animals so that one can score animal surival easily. Thus, we achieve a large enough sample size for drawing meaningful statistical inferences without employing a computer vision system and complicated imaging system otherwise required for a larger chamber. These considerations make the NemaLife chip easily implementable in research labs conducting lifespan assays and investigator scoring options provide quality control on data. In sum, the NemaLife chip is a simple and low-cost means to obtain reliable lifespan and physiological data on aging animals. The NemaLife chip can be developed into a fully automated platform, that can offer progeny removal, feeding, drug delivery, and phenotypic scoring using automated pump systems and an appropriate software. Thus, the NemaLife chip has a significant potential both as a low-cost “manual” device that can be used in many labs and as a core component of a fully automated platform.Experimental procedures Worm culture All animals were cultured on 60 mm petri dishes containing nematode growth medium (NGM) at 20 °C before loading into the microfluidic chamber. The NGM filled petri dishes were seeded with 300–400 μL of bacteria Escherichia coli OP50 and incubated for 48 h at 20 °C. For age synchronization, 20–25 gravid adults were placed on seeded plates to lay eggs for 2–4 h. After eggs were laid, the animals were removed from the plates, eggs were incubated for 60–72 h. The day the eggs were laid was scored as day 0. In this study, we used wild-type Bristol (N2), GR1307[daf-16 (mgDf50)I], CB1370[daf-2 (e1370)III], TJ1052[age-1(hx546)II], DA1116[eat-2(ad1116)II] and TJ356[zIs356 [daf-16p::daf-16a/b::GFP + rol-6(su1006)]IV]. Wild-type (N2), daf-16, and daf-2 mutants were received from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC); age-1 and eat-2 strains were kindly provided by the Driscoll lab.Device fabrication and preparation All microfluidic devices were fabricated in poly(dimethyl)siloxane (PDMS) using soft lithography85. A mold was fabricated using two-step SU-8 photolithography such that the chamber height is ≈ 100 μm and the micropillar height is ≈ 75 μm, as described previously52. A 4–6 mm thick PDMS (Sylgard 184 A and B, 1:10 by weight, Dow Corning) layer was casted on to the mold and the inlet/outlet holes were punched with a 1 mm hole puncher. The PDMS device was then bonded on a glass surface irreversibly and rendered hydrophilic by plasma treatment (Harrick Plasma Inc.). Before using the device for lifespan experiments, the device interiors were filled with 70% ethanol for 5 min to sterilize them. Subsequently, the device was rinsed 4–5 times with S-complete solution. Devices were then treated with 5 wt% Pluronic F127 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min to prevent protein and bacterial build-up36. In addition, Pluronic treatment also assists with removal of air bubbles if any are trapped. After incubation, excess Pluronic was removed by washing with S-complete. The Pluronic-treated devices were stored in moist petri dishes at 20 °C for immediate use and at 4 °C for future use.Food preparation E. coli OP50 was used as the bacterial food source for worms grown on both NGM and maintained within the devices. Bacterial suspension of 100 mg mL−1 in S-complete solution corresponding to ~ 2 × 1011 was used for lifespan assays unless otherwise noted. E. coli OP50 was grown overnight at 37 °C in standard LB broth. Bacterial suspensions of 100 mg mL−1 were prepared by centrifuging 500 mL of overnight bacterial culture and resuspending the pellet in S-complete. Concentrated OP50 was stored at 4 °C for subsequent use, up to 2 weeks.Bacteria preparation for RNAi studies Engineered bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) were obtained from the Driscoll Lab and used for testing the RNAi efficacy in the device. Fragments designed for targeting daf-16 and age-1 were cloned into the L4440 feeding vector and the resulting plasmids were transformed into the HT115 (DE3) using standard protocols73. Bacteria with empty L4440 vector (no cloned fragments) were used as the negative control for all experiments involving RNAi. Bacterial colonies were grown on LB agar supplemented with 50 µg/ml carbenicillin for 48 h at 37 °C. Fresh plates were made each week. Single colonies of bacteria were picked and grown in culture flasks with shaking at 200 rpm for 16 h in sterile LB broth with 50 µg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. For induction, 0.4 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added for 2 h at 37 °C while shaking. At 18 h, additional IPTG was added for a final concentration of 1 mM. Concentrated bacterial solutions were prepared each day using procedures described above. Final IPTG concentration was maintained at 1 mM in the food solution.Bacterial density measurement and food consumption To assess whether the diet of the animals becomes restricted during overnight incubation, we determined the amount of food consumed by the animals during reproduction, a period of peak food consumption. We first obtained a calibration curve relating bacterial density in cfu/mL to optical density readouts. Using this calibration, we determined the daily consumption of food by the animals. A Synergy HT plate reader was calibrated for E. coli OP50 culture using standard microbiological techniques. Briefly, following the growth of overnight culture at 37 °C, 100 mg/mL E. coli OP50 in S-medium was serially diluted to 211. Density of diluted suspensions was determined by measuring the absorbance of 150 µL aliquots in a flat-bottom 96 well plate. Each diluted suspension was subsequently serially diluted to 10–7 and 0.1 mL of bacteria was plated onto standard LB plates. Plates were incubated at 37 °C, and individual colonies were counted after 24 h. A plot of cfu/mL against OD600 readings of the original sample was plotted to obtain a linear regression. 9–14 Young adult (65 h) worms were loaded into NemaLife housing chambers by using 1 mL syringe. 100 µL of E. coli OP50 suspension (100 mg/mL) was pushed through the chamber to eliminate potential dilution by the liquid buffer (~ 6.75 µL) that remains in the chamber. To determine the concentration of bacterial cells upon feeding each chamber was washed with buffer and the solution collected immediately after introducing bacteria to the chamber. Microfluidic chips were stored at 20 °C for 24 h, then chambers were washed with buffer and fluid is collected for each. Fresh E. coli OP50 is then replaced as described above. Each sample from before and after incubation is centrifuged at 3500 RPM for 10 min and resuspended in 1 mL of fresh buffer. Bacterial density (cfu/mL) was determined by measuring the optical density (wavelength 600 nm) of 150 µL of the fluid collected from the chamber and resuspended in buffer. OD600 measurements are applied to our calibration curves (see below). We determined an OD600 of ~ 1.0 correlates to 4.1 × 1011 cells/mL.Fluorescence imaging We imaged the C. elegans strain containing stress reporter gene zls356IV inside the device without immobilizing them using a Nikon Ti microscope at 10X magnification. Movies were captured using fast time lapse imaging with a camera (Zyla 5.5 sCMOS from Andor Inc.). For imaging worms cultured on agar plates, worms were loaded into a fresh chamber and imaged immediately. Movies were analyzed using ImageJ () software.Scoring animal death Worms were counted manually, and lifespan was scored daily. An animal was scored as dead if it failed to respond to (1) gentle flow of fluid throughout the chamber or (2) gentle tapping of the device by a 3/8″ Allen key. If there is no movement in the pharynx or in the tail 1 min after the stimulus has been applied, we scored the animal as dead. Each death event was scored as 1 and unaccounted deaths (missing, washing error, matricides) were scored as 0. A lifespan curve (Kaplan–Meier) was then generated. Kaplan–Meier curves and Log-Rank statistics were generated using the Statistics Toolbox in MATLAB.Locomotory measures Reversal and forward speed were scored after a gentle tap on the PDMS device with a 3/8″ Allen key, at a location close to the tip of the pharynx. Only the initial, instantaneous reversal following stimulation were scored. Continuous frames of a spontaneous start of reversal and end of reversal were taken as a complete reversal episode. Reversal episodes with a pause, stop, or intermittent reversal were not included. Continuous forward locomotion until a spontaneous reversal was scored to determine forward speed. Images were captured using SVSi streamview camera at 10 frames/s. Locomotion speed was calculated by tracking the displacement of the pharynx in time. The maximum speed in an episode (forward/reversal) of a worm was recorded as the maximum reversal/forward speed.Pharyngeal pumping Movies of 10 individual worms were captured at a rate of 20 frames/s with SVSi streamview camera on a Zeiss stereo microscope at 5 × magnification, 15 min after the addition of food to the device. Complete cycle time of contraction/retraction of the isthmus/terminal bulb of pharynx was manually computed using ImageJ (). The number of pharyngeal pumping cycles were counted over a 10 s period for each single animal and then reported as cycles per minute.Data analysis All the survival analyses were conducted in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2014b). Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to compare survival between treatment groups. Two-sample t test was used to compare growth of the worm and crawling kinematics in the optimization study.Supplementary information Supplementary Information. (439.7KB, docx) Supplementary Movie 1.

    "abstract": "Summary Extended space travel is a goal of government space agencies and private companies. However, spaceflight poses risks to human health, and the effects on the nervous system have to be better characterized. Here, we exploited the unique experimental advantages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to explore how spaceflight affects adult neurons in vivo. We found that animals that lived 5 days of adulthood on the International Space Station exhibited hyperbranching in PVD and touch receptor neurons. We also found that, in the presence of a neuronal proteotoxic stress, spaceflight promotes a remarkable accumulation of neuronal-derived waste in the surrounding tissues, suggesting an impaired transcellular degradation of debris released from neurons. Our data reveal that spaceflight can significantly affect adult neuronal morphology and clearance of neuronal trash, highlighting the need to carefully assess the risks of long-duration spaceflight on the nervous system and to develop adequate countermeasures for safe space exploration. Subject areas: neuroscience, developmental neuroscience, space sciences",
    "introduction": "Introduction Humankind as long been fascinated by space exploration. Yuri Gagarin first showed in 1961 that humans could survive in space, and Neil Armstrong and Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin became the first to walk on the moon in 1969. Now, the International Space Station (ISS), a multinational collaborative station that orbits Earth, has been continuously occupied with crew since November 2000. Into the future, both governmental space agencies and private companies plan to send crewed missions to Mars and beyond. Research to date, however, makes evident that spaceflight poses health risks to the human body, including detrimental effects to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems (Crucian et al., 2018; Fitts et al., 2001; Shen and Frishman, 2019; Sibonga, 2013; Williams et al., 2009). Particularly striking is the loss of up to 20% of muscle mass in short-duration spaceflights (Adams et al., 2003; Edgerton et al., 1995), which can be ameliorated by regular physical exercise (Loehr et al., 2015). Much less is known about the effects of spaceflight on neuronal morphology and function, especially in vivo and at the single-neuron level. Given the impracticality of conducting such studies in humans, the use of animal models in which detailed high-resolution neuronal analyses can be performed is invaluable for assessing conserved neuronal responses to spaceflight and developing effective countermeasures to mitigate the consequences of long-duration missions. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetic model widely used in neurobiology, aging, and stress research that is amenable for assessing the effects of spaceflight on neuronal biology given its unique advantages: ease of culture in large numbers due to its microscopic size; a transparent body that permits in vivo imaging of multiple tissues, single cells, and even cellular organelles; and a short lifespan (2–3 weeks) that allows for even a short-duration spaceflight mission to correspond to a large portion of the C. elegans lifetime. Importantly, the spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy observed in humans is conserved in C. elegans, as several studies reported a downregulation of muscular components in space-flown nematodes (Adenle et al., 2009; Higashibata et al., 2006, 2016; Selch et al., 2008). The aging C. elegans musculature also displays the fundamental characteristics of human sarcopenia (the pervasive age-associated loss of muscle mass and strength that contributes to human frailty) (Herndon et al., 2002), and physical exercise in C. elegans mimics human exercise by inducing multi-systemic health benefits (Hartman et al., 2018; Laranjeiro et al., 2017, 2019). In addition to muscle changes, space-flown C. elegans have altered metabolism and differential expression of longevity-related genes (Adenle et al., 2009; Higashibata et al., 2016; Honda et al., 2012; Selch et al., 2008). The C. elegans nervous system is composed of exactly 302 neurons, each one with a well-described morphology. Thus, transgenic nematodes in which neuronal subpopulations are fluorescently labeled allow for in vivo single-neuron assessments that are virtually impossible in the highly complex mammalian brain. Here, we show that adult C. elegans that lived 5 days on the ISS exhibit morphological changes in two distinct types of sensory neurons when compared to ground control animals. We identify hyperbranching as a common response of adult neurons to spaceflight. We also studied proteostressed touch neurons with a focus on a formerly unrecognized mechanism by which C. elegans neurons can extrude large membrane-surrounded vesicles that contain neuronal waste (e.g. protein aggregates and damaged organelles) (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). On Earth, the extruded neurotoxic components are, in most cases, efficiently degraded by the surrounding tissues, which in the case studied is the nematode hypodermis (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). We find that, under spaceflight conditions, proteostressed neurons are associated with a striking accumulation of neuronal debris in the surrounding tissues not apparent in ground controls, indicating a severe dysregulation in the ability to clear neuronal waste in space-flown, middle-aged animals. Our results reveal spaceflight-associated challenges to systemic proteostasis and underscore the need to carefully assess the cellular consequences of long-duration spaceflight as strategies to maintain health are developed.",

    "results": "Results A spaceflight protocol that features adult-only C. elegans culture and enables analysis of microgravity impact on a cohort that spans early adult life to middle age For all experiments presented in this study, we grew C. elegans in a liquid culture of S-Basal with freeze-dried E. coli OP50 as a food source. Prior to launch, we cultured synchronized populations of young adult nematodes that we loaded into polyethylene (PE) bags with 6.5 mL of liquid culture (∼300 animals/bag) on December 2, 2018 (see detailed optimization of culture conditions (Pollard et al., 2020)). Importantly, given our goal of assessing the effects of spaceflight during adult life rather than during animal development, we added 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FUdR) to the culture bags to suppress production of progeny and to guarantee that the animals we loaded into the bags would be the same ones we scored upon their return to Earth, as opposed to their progeny. Our samples were loaded into SpaceX CRS-16, the 16th Commercial Resupply Service mission to the ISS, and launched on December 5, 2018 aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX CRS-16 docked to the ISS on December 8, 2018, and the C. elegans samples, which were kept in cold stowage (8–13°C) once introduced into their flight bags, were transferred to 20°C for five days, beginning on December 9, 2018. After five days, the C. elegans culture bags were transferred to −80°C and kept frozen until return to Earth (Figure 1). For ground control samples, we loaded young adult nematodes into PE bags on December 5, 2018 and exposed C. elegans to the same time frame/temperatures as space samples but maintained cultures on Earth. A key aspect of our experimental design is thus that we generated middle-aged nematodes that experienced most of their physiological aging in microgravity (ISS) vs. normal gravity (Earth). Figure 1. Open in a new tab A spaceflight protocol to assess microgravity impact on C. elegans adult life Diagram showing the timeline of C. elegans life at 20°C, with approximately 2.5 days of embryonic and larval development and approximately three weeks (21 days) of adulthood. We indicate in red the crucial events in our experimental design by which we obtained middle-aged animals that experienced most of their physiological aging on the International Space Station (ISS). Note that C. elegans were kept in cold stowage (8–13°C) for approximately 7 days, relatively low temperatures that significantly delayed progression through adult stages. We estimated the cold stowage period to correspond to approximately 3 days at 20°C. After 5 days on the ISS at 20°C, samples were frozen and returned to Earth for analysis. Spaceflight induces morphological remodeling of adult PVD sensory neurons We started by studying the effects of spaceflight in the morphology of PVD sensory neurons, polymodal nociceptors with spectacular morphologies that sense harsh touch (Way and Chalfie, 1989), cold temperature (Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010), and posture (Albeg et al., 2011). The two PVD neurons (one on the left side and one on the right side of the body) extend processes that branch to cover most of the body and, together with FLP neurons in the head, possess the most complex dendritic arborization structure of all C. elegans neurons (Figure 2A). The highly branched, yet stereotyped, morphology of PVD dendrites arises sequentially during larval development, with primary (1°) branches forming during the L2 stage, secondary (2°) and tertiary (3°) branches forming during the L3 stage, and quaternary (4°) branches forming during the early L4 stage (Oren-Suissa et al., 2010). By the late L4 stage, PVD patterning is completed, and the repetitive structural units resembling candelabras or menorahs become apparent (Figure 2A). Figure 2. Open in a new tab The PVD dendritic tree is affected by spaceflight (A) Diagram showing the morphology of adult PVD sensory neurons. The characteristic PVD branches that form during larval development (1°–4° branches) to produce the repetitive structural units called menorahs are indicated in red. We performed all quantifications in the 100 μm anterior to the PVD cell body as depicted by the blue dashed box. A, anterior; P, posterior.

We determined statistical significance by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean.We used a C. elegans strain in which PVD neurons express a translational fusion of transmembrane protein DES-2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (DES-2::GFP) (Oren-Suissa et al., 2010). All tiers of the PVD dendrites are well visualized by GFP in this strain, and approaches toward quantitative imaging of branching have been published (Kravtsov et al., 2017; Oren-Suissa et al., 2010, 2017). We compared PVD neurons from middle-aged space-flown vs. ground control animals by scoring 1°–4° branch structures. We found that the space-flown PVD neurons did not degenerate en masse nor did they exhibit major dendritic gaps relative to ground control PVD neurons (n = 51–56 PVD neurons/condition) (Figures 2B and 2C). However, when we carefully quantified the number of branches and other menorah-related phenotypes in a 100-μm domain anterior to the PVD soma (Figure 2A), we registered consistent differences between control and spaceflight animals. More specifically, space-flown animals exhibited increased numbers of 2° and 3° branches, whereas the number of 4° branches remained constant between control and spaceflight animals (Figure 2D), indicating a plastic morphological restructuring during adult life with outcome that differs consequent to microgravity experience. On Earth, the PVD dendritic pattern is established during larval stages, but adult neurons still exhibit a limited plasticity of the dendritic trees, with dynamic growth and retraction events occurring during lifetime (Kravtsov et al., 2017). Moreover, the PVD dendritic trees show age-dependent hyperbranching, disorganization, and loss of self-avoidance within tree branches (Kravtsov et al., 2017). Whether these changes reflect deleterious aspects of aging or adaptive processes as the animal grows remains unclear. With regard to spaceflight samples, our quantification of the number of extra branches derived from 4° branches (5°, 6°, and 7° branches) and the number of ectopic branches (ectopic 2°, 3°, and 4°) found that space-flown animals displayed an increased number of 5° branches (Figure 3A) and ectopic 3° branches (Figure 3B) relative to ground control animals. Retrograde branches (4° or higher-order branches that migrate toward the 3° branch by forming a hook) were also present at significantly higher numbers in spaceflight PVD neurons when compared to control counterparts (Figure 3C). We observed that spaceflight increased the proportion of disorganized menorahs (menorahs with extra/ectopic branches) (Figure 3D) and the proportion of self-avoidance defects (no gap in 3° branch between adjacent menorahs) (Figure 3E). PVD dendrites also exhibit age-associated degeneration characterized by the appearance of bead- or bubble-like structures along the dendrites, which are enriched in autophagosomes and fragmented microtubules (E et al., 2018). We focused on this morphological feature but found no difference in the number of beads/bubbles present in PVD dendrites of space-flown animals relative to ground control animals (Figure 3F). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Spaceflight promotes hyperbranching, disorganization, and self-avoidance defects in PVD sensory neurons (A–F) Quantifications in ground control and spaceflight PVD neurons of 5°, 6°, and 7° branches (A), ectopic 2°, ectopic 3°, and ectopic 4° branches (B), retrograde branches (C), disorganized menorahs (D), self-avoidance defects (E), and beads/bubbles (F). We highlight each PVD remodeling phenotype with a diagram (left panel) and a representative confocal image from DES-2::GFP animals (center panel). Number of animals used for analysis in A–E: nControl = 51, nSpace = 56. Number of animals used for analysis in F: nControl = 12, nSpace = 12 (we randomly selected 12 ground control and spaceflight animals for scoring; each point represents a single animal). We determined statistical significance by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test (A–C, F) and by Fisher’s exact test (D, E). ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean.Overall, our data reveal that spaceflight induces significant remodeling of the PVD dendritic tree in adult C. elegans without promoting neurodegeneration. Importantly, the morphological changes we report here for sensory neurons occurred during adult life, indicating that microgravity can influence the morphology of adult neurons. Spaceflight promotes modest morphological changes in adult touch receptor neurons The complex dendritic tree of PVD neurons contrasts with the simple morphology of a single unbranched process adopted by most C. elegans neurons (White et al., 1986). The six touch receptor neurons (AVM, ALML, ALMR, PVM, PLML, and PLMR) mediate the response to gentle touch, with each extending a single major dendritic process anteriorly (Chalfie and Sulston, 1981) (Figure 4A). We sought to investigate the effects of spaceflight on touch receptor neuron morphology by studying a C. elegans strain in which touch receptor neurons are specifically labeled with soluble GFP (Pmec-4GFP).

(D) Diagram showing a touch receptor neuron with a branch, an outgrowth, high-intensity fluorescent puncta in the cell body, and an exopher. (E–G) Quantifications in ground control and spaceflight Pmec-4GFP animals of the number of branches (E), outgrowths (F), and exophers (G) in each of the six touch receptor neurons. We highlight each touch receptor neuron phenotype with a representative confocal image from Pmec-4GFP animals. Number of touch receptor neurons used for analysis: nControl = 54–61, nSpace = 60–64. Note that the different number of neurons used for analysis in each condition derives from the fact that, depending on the animal position during imaging, not all touch receptor neurons are visible in certain animals. We determined statistical significance by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. See also Figure S1.We found that middle-aged nematodes that lived five days of adulthood on the ISS exhibited touch receptor neurons with an overall morphology similar to ground control animals, with no obvious degeneration, dendritic gaps, or soma/process mislocalization (n = 54–64 of each touch receptor neuron/condition) (Figures 4B and 4C). For a detailed morphological characterization of each neuron, we quantified age-dependent morphological changes previously reported for touch receptor neurons (Toth et al., 2012), including new branches that extend from the main process (“branches”) and new processes emerging from the soma (“outgrowths”) (Figure 4D). We observed an overall trend in space-flown animals for increased number of branches in all six touch receptor neurons (statistically significant for ALMR and PLML) relative to ground control animals (Figure 4E), whereas we found the number of outgrowths was generally unchanged by spaceflight (except for PVM) (Figure 4F). Thus, C. elegans adult touch receptor neurons undergo minor structural changes consequent to space travel. Together, our data reveal that spaceflight during adult life does not promote major morphological changes in touch receptor neurons. Still, the hyperbranching phenotype detected in specific adult touch receptor neurons and the morphological changes observed in adult PVD neurons suggest that modest neuronal restructuring might constitute a general neuronal response to microgravity and/or other stresses associated with spaceflight. Spaceflight induces a distinctive response to neuronal mCherry extrusion Spaceflight includes novel stresses experienced by organisms during lift-off/reentry and extended microgravity periods, and some of these stresses have been suggested to contribute to accelerated aging (Demontis et al., 2017). Among the many stress response pathways activated and compromised by aging are proteostasis pathways such as autophagy and protein degradation processes (Kaushik and Cuervo, 2015). Although fluxes through such pathways are difficult to measure in spaceflight samples, we considered some physical readouts thought to reflect proteostasis status. Expression of GFP in touch receptor neurons can induce high-intensity fluorescent puncta in the soma (Figure 4D). We found that the absolute numbers of GFP puncta in touch neurons did not differ between middle-aged nematodes on Earth and the ones that spent the corresponding five days on the ISS (Figure S1A). However, we did observe a trend in space-flown animals for an increased proportion of large GFP puncta (diameter ≥0.9 μm) in the soma of touch receptor neurons as compared to ground control animals (Figure S1B). Although we cannot distinguish whether the touch neuron puncta correspond to aggregates, developing aggresomes, or liquid phase droplets, the differential handling of introduced GFP suggests physiological differences between Earth and spaceflight neurons. We also reasoned that we might readily evaluate one proteostress response using fluorescence imaging of marked neurons – the extrusion of neuronal garbage. Touch receptor neurons can extrude large membrane-surrounded vesicles called exophers that contain protein aggregates and organelles (Melentijevic et al., 2017) (Figure 4D). Exopher production increases under enhanced proteostress, as well as under environmental stresses such as elevated superoxide production (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017), possibly as a conserved protective mechanism of proteostasis. Under standard conditions, exopher production in GFP-labeled neurons is a relatively rare event (Melentijevic et al., 2017). We found that spaceflight did not significantly increase overall exopher detection in touch receptor neurons of Pmec-4GFP animals (Figure 4G). We did, however, note an interesting switch in the apparent rates of exopher production in individual touch receptor neurons. On Earth, adult ALMR neurons reproducibly produce more baseline exophers than other neurons, including the left side counterpart ALML (Melentijevic et al., 2017), but in spaceflight animals, left side ALML produced more baseline exophers (Figure 4G). Our observations raise the possibility that maintained gravitational forces may influence left/right asymmetries associated with stresses or their management in particular neurons. GFP-expressing touch receptor neurons have been studied extensively and are not thought to experience any particular stress as a consequence of the GFP expression (Chalfie et al., 1994; Herndon et al., 2002). Other transgenically supplied reporters such as mCherry can appear disruptive to normal physiology and are associated with an enhanced level of selective extrusion in exophers (Melentijevic et al., 2017). We wondered whether “at risk” neurons, pre-sensitized by the genetic introduction of a noxious mCherry-induced proteostress, might be impacted by spaceflight. Thus, we examined space-flown animals of a strain that over-produces an mCherry reporter well characterized to elevate the production of exophers in touch receptor neurons (Pmec-4mCherry1) (Melentijevic et al., 2017). We examined the neuronal morphology, apparent protein aggregation, and exopher-genesis in the presence of the mCherry stressor. We found that touch receptor neurons of space-flown Pmec-4mCherry1 animals exhibited a generally normal neuronal morphology (n = 42–66 of each touch receptor neuron/condition). We observed a trend in spaceflight animals for increased number of mCherry foci in the soma of specific touch receptor neurons (AVM, ALMR, PLML, and statistically significant in PLMR) relative to ground control animals (Figure S2A), whereas we detected no significant differences in the proportion of large internal mCherry foci (diameter ≥0.9 μm) between both conditions (Figure S2B). We found no significant differences in the absolute number of exophers present in middle-aged control vs. spaceflight touch neurons (Figure S2C). We did, however, observe a striking difference in mCherry reporter signal present outside the touch receptor neurons: a remarkably large proportion of Pmec-4mCherry1 animals that spent 5 days of adulthood on the ISS contained numerous mCherry-fluorescent structures throughout the body, a phenotype we never observed in ground control animals (Figures 5A, 5B, and S3). While exophers produced by ground control animals are found almost exclusively near touch receptor neuron cell bodies, in limited numbers (one or two exophers produced at the most per neuron), and with characteristic sizes (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017), fluorescent structures in space-flown animals ranged from small particles to large rounded structures that could appear as a continuous layer covering multiple regions of the body (Figures 5B and S3). Figure 5.

Scale bars, 10 μm. See also Figures S2 and S3.C. elegans touch receptor neurons run through and are fully surrounded by hypodermal tissue. When exophers are extruded, they must therefore enter the hypodermis, which attempts digestion of exopher contents via its extensive lysosomal network. mCherry exopher contents that cannot be digested in the surrounding hypodermis are eventually extruded from the hypodermis into the C. elegans pseudocoelom. Materials floating through the pseudocoelom can be taken up by scavenger cells called coelomocytes (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). During the process of transit through the hypodermis, the mCherry exopher contents often become dispersed in the hypodermal lysosomal network, appearing as small fluorescent particles (we refer to this as a “Starry Night” phenotype) (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). The unexpected distribution of fluorescence that we observed in spaceflight Pmec-4mCherry1 animals appears comprised of two main components (Figure 6A): small fluorescent particles resembling the Starry Night phenotype and large rounded fluorescent structures (“spaceflight vesicles” or “sVesicles”) that we have not previously found in this C. elegans strain under standard culture conditions (even in much older adults) (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). These large rounded structures have the appearance of the enlarged hypodermal lysosomes that can be found in C. elegans mutants defective in lysosomal function and assembly (Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019).

We scored tissue location by imaging different planes on each animal; “hypodermal” corresponded to the peripheral layer surrounding the body, “intestinal” corresponded to the cells surrounding the intestinal lumen, and “other” corresponded to locations in the body not easily identifiable. We randomly selected a subgroup of spaceflight Pmec-4mCherry1 animals to score the location of Starry Night and sVesicles in the anterior-posterior body axis and in different tissues. (H) Confocal image of a spaceflight Pmec-4mCherry1 animal showing the variation in fluorescence intensity of sVesicles. Scale bar, 10 μm. See also Figure S4.We characterized the presence and location of both Starry Night and sVesicles in our samples. We found a striking increase in the proportion of animals with Starry Night in control vs. spaceflight (7% vs. 67%) (Figure 6B). In ground control animals, we always found Starry Night in the mid-body and in the hypodermis (peripheral layer surrounding the body) (Figures 6C and 6D). In space-flown animals, we still found Starry Night predominantly in the mid-body, but in approximately half of the cases, the Starry Night dispersed fluorescence expanded into the anterior and/or the posterior region of the body (Figure 6C). Regarding tissue location, we detected that Starry Night after spaceflight was always present in the hypodermis (Videos S1 and S2) but could also spread into the intestine (15% of animals) or other tissues (48% of animals) (Figure 6D). We did not observe sVesicles in any of the 72 ground control animals analyzed, whereas 52 out of the 83 space-flown animals (63%) exhibited sVesicles (Figure 6E). The location distribution of sVesicles in spaceflight animals was similar to Starry Night location, with sVesicles found predominantly in the mid-body but also in the anterior and posterior regions of the body (Figure 6F), and the primarily hypodermal location (Videos S1 and S2) extended into the intestine (7% of animals) or other tissues (56% of animals) (Figure 6G). Despite the extensive mCherry fluorescence found outside the touch receptor neurons in spaceflight animals, we rarely observed mCherry fluorescence in coelomocytes in this sample (only 1 out of 56 animals). The similar distribution patterns of Starry Night and sVesicles, together with the fact that 96% of the animals that exhibited sVesicles also had Starry Night, strongly support a link between both phenomena.

The animal head is localized toward the left at the start of the movie. Download video file (4.4MB, flv) We tried to identify the sVesicles found in spaceflight nematodes by performing antibody staining for the lysosomal marker LMP-1 but were unable to get specific staining, possibly due to the paraformaldehyde fixation that we had to perform when thawing the frozen nematodes (essential to maintain a strong fluorescence from reporters). Moreover, it appeared that the sVesicles could be readily disrupted as we found that alternative fixation methods (e.g. methanol and acetic acid) led to the disappearance of most mCherry fluorescence outside the touch receptor neurons. The fragility of the sVesicle structures limited our ability to definitively confirm the nature of the hypodermal structures we observed. We did find that the fluorescence intensity of the sVesicles varied greatly, ranging from a bright to a diffuse, dim fluorescence (Figure 6H), which is consistent with sVesicles being at different stages of lysosomal degradation. We were fortunate that an unanticipated feature of the flight population enabled us to compare mCherry distribution in some escaper progeny in the culture bag from the ISS. We found that despite our use of FUdR to limit reproduction, some progeny were able to develop up to young adulthood. We could easily identify these animals from older adults by their reduced size. Young adult animals present in the same culture bag as the middle-aged adults that were our major focus exhibited the fluorescent structures at extremely low levels (Figure S4), suggesting that the dramatic sVesicle profiles in the hypodermis could be age dependent. We cannot rule out, however, that a variable introduced during development in spaceflight could be responsible for the lack of the large sVesicle pattern in younger animals. Overall, our data reveal that, in the presence of an internal cell-specific proteotoxic stress (i.e., mCherry overexpression in touch receptor neurons), spaceflight is associated with significant extrusion of the offensive protein in middle-aged touch receptor neurons. Unexpectedly, the extruded material appears to become stuck in the hypodermal lysosomal network, and the lysosomal network adopts a morphology similar to that observed when lysosomes are unable to degrade their substrates. Our data suggest that in microgravity, extruded neuronal garbage is not handled as efficiently by the neighboring cell that collects neuronal debris and attempts degradation. Future experiments will be necessary to determine the exact mechanism causing mCherry accumulation in large quantities in multiple tissues of C. elegans consequent to spaceflight. Still, it is interesting that our results suggest that spaceflight can increase mCherry spread from touch receptor neurons to neighboring tissues (via exophers and/or unknown mechanisms) and that these significant extrusions are not processed in neighboring tissues as occurs on Earth. The abnormal fluorescent structures observed primarily in the hypodermis suggest that the degradative pathways of middle-aged animals may become overwhelmed in response to spaceflight with the resulting inability to quickly clear neuronal trash. Thus, in upcoming spaceflight missions, it will be fascinating to specifically track the hypodermal lysosomal network and to determine whether other proteostressors such as aggregation-prone human neurodegenerative disease proteins tau, amyloid beta, huntingtin, or alpha-synuclein promote similar distinctive outcomes.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Spaceflight has been shown to induce adverse effects on the human body at multiple levels, including in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems (Crucian et al., 2018; Fitts et al., 2001; Shen and Frishman, 2019; Sibonga, 2013; Williams et al., 2009). However, the effect of spaceflight on neuronal morphology and function, especially in vivo, is largely unknown. In this study, we took advantage of the unique characteristics of the nematode C. elegans (e.g. ease of culture in large numbers and transparent body allowing for in vivo imaging of fluorescently labeled transgenic lines) to address how spaceflight affects the morphology of different adult neurons and the response to a neuronal proteotoxic stress. We show that spaceflight induces extensive remodeling of the PVD dendritic tree in adult C. elegans relative to ground control animals, whereas touch receptor neurons exhibit modest morphological changes in response to spaceflight. Importantly, hyperbranching is a consistent response to spaceflight between different adult neuron types. We also report on a striking difference in the ability to respond to a neuronal proteostress (i.e., mCherry overexpression) in spaceflight vs. Earth samples, in which adults that aged on the ISS exhibited accumulated extruded neuronal garbage outside the neurons, distributed in neighboring tissues. Our observations raise the intriguing possibility that spaceflight may impair neuronal proteostasis/clearance pathways, which may hold significant health implications for long-duration spaceflights. Spaceflight promotes remodeling of complex adult dendritic trees We found that spaceflight promoted hyperbranching, disorganization, and loss of self-avoidance in middle-aged PVD neurons. These phenotypes have been shown to increase during aging in C. elegans (Kravtsov et al., 2017), raising the possibility that space-flown animals experienced accelerated aging compared to ground control counterparts. However, we observed no increase in space-flown animals of age-associated PVD degeneration (i.e. number of beads/bubbles), which is tightly linked to the functional aging of PVD neurons (E et al., 2018). Adult animals with disorganized PVD dendritic trees rarely show defects in response to harsh touch (E et al., 2018; Kravtsov et al., 2017), suggesting that changes in dendritic architecture are not necessarily a deleterious aspect of aging but rather might be part of normal neuronal maintenance and an adaptive response to intrinsic/extrinsic cues. Furthermore, in other models, most physiological changes induced by spaceflight are reversed upon return to Earth and therefore can be considered physiological adaptations to the spaceflight environment (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Honda et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2009). Thus, we hypothesize that the PVD remodeling we describe here is more likely an adaptive change to spaceflight conditions rather than an overall increase in aging rate. Testing this hypothesis is a challenge for spaceflight experiments as the C. elegans lifespan is shorter than typical missions. A complex cross talk between muscle, skin (hypodermis), and PVD neurons defines the pattern of higher-order branches in the PVD dendritic tree (Diaz-Balzac et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2015; Salzberg et al., 2013; Yang and Chien, 2019; Zhu et al., 2017). Briefly, the extracellular matrix protein UNC-52/Perlecan forms regular stripes by following the location of the dense bodies of sarcomeres and is essential for the formation of regular hypodermal hemidesmosomes, which are the attachments that mechanically link the hypodermis to the muscle. The intermediate filament MUA-6, which is a component of the hemidesmosome, patterns the transmembrane cell adhesion molecule SAX-7/L1CAM in hypodermal stripes by locally excluding SAX-7 from the regions where MUA-6 is present. Then, SAX-7 physically interacts with the transmembrane receptor DMA-1 in PVD neurons to instruct the growth of 4° branches. Given the well-established and conserved role of spaceflight in muscle degeneration (Adenle et al., 2009; Fitts et al., 2001; Higashibata et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2009), we propose that PVD dendritic morphology in space-flown C. elegans may be indirectly affected by changes at the body wall muscle level. In fact, microgravity in C. elegans has been shown to downregulate the expression of multiple muscle dense body genes and intermediate filament genes, including mua-6 (Higashibata et al., 2016). Areas where MUA-6 is absent have abnormally shaped PVD dendrites (Liang et al., 2015), suggesting that the downregulation of muscle structural genes together with mua-6 by microgravity could contribute to the changes we observed in space-flown PVD neurons, particularly the hyperbranching, menorah disorganization, and increase in retrograde branches. Spaceflight has also been suggested to reduce insulin signaling in C. elegans (Honda et al., 2012; Selch et al., 2008), whereas the insulin/IGF-1 receptor daf-2 mutant exhibits an increase in PVD 2° branches (Gioran et al., 2014) and self-avoidance defects (Kravtsov et al., 2017). Thus, a putative modulation in insulin signaling in space-flown C. elegans might contribute to some of the PVD remodeling phenotypes that we describe in this study. Hyperbranching may be a conserved response of adult neurons to spaceflight We found that space-flown C. elegans exhibited touch receptor neurons with modest morphological changes (i.e., hyperbranching) when compared to ground control animals. Interestingly, impaired mitochondrial respiration increases branching in both touch receptor neurons and PVD neurons (Gioran et al., 2014), akin to our observations after spaceflight. Moreover, spaceflight in C. elegans has been shown to induce a metabolic shift (Adenle et al., 2009; Selch et al., 2008) and decrease the expression of numerous enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and of all electron transport chain complexes (Higashibata et al., 2016), strongly indicating that mitochondrial respiration is reduced during spaceflight. Therefore, changes in mitochondrial function during spaceflight may contribute to the hyperbranching phenotype that we described in different adult neuronal cell types. The subtle morphological changes induced by spaceflight in touch receptor neurons contrasted with an extensive remodeling of the PVD dendritic tree. This difference in response to spaceflight can be explain by the innate morphology of each neuron (i.e., the highly branched dendritic tree of PVD neurons allows for the detection of multiple morphological abnormalities vs. a single unbranched process of touch receptor neurons), the stimuli sensed by each neuron (i.e., PVD neurons may sense microgravity more directly than touch receptor neurons given their role in proprioception (Albeg et al., 2011)), and/or the fact that PVD morphology is indirectly affected by changes at the muscle level (as discussed previously). Despite the differences between neuron types, our results suggest hyperbranching as a common neuronal adaptive response to spaceflight. This response may in fact be conserved from C. elegans to mammals given that Septin 7, a GTP-binding protein critical for dendrite branching (Xie et al., 2007), has been shown to be significantly upregulated in the brain of mice exposed to the ISS environment for 3 months (Santucci et al., 2012). Clearance of neuronal waste is not affected by spaceflight in normal conditions In addition to neuronal morphological changes, we also assessed how spaceflight modulated the extrusion of neuronal garbage by touch receptor neurons, with a focus on the potential extrusion of large membrane-surrounded vesicles called exophers (Melentijevic et al., 2017). We found that GFP-labeled touch receptor neurons, which are not thought to be stressed by transgene expression, exhibited an overall similar number of detectable exophers in middle-aged animals exposed to the ISS vs. Earth environment. It is interesting that for GFP-labeled anterior touch neurons, we measured a difference in the left-right asymmetry in exopher production levels. On Earth, the ALM neuron on the right side of the body (ALMR) consistently produces more exophers than the left side ALM neuron (ALML) (Melentijevic et al., 2017). However, in space-flown animals, we observed a reversal in exopher-genesis rate between ALMR and ALML neurons. Although the reason underlying this reversal is unclear, a recent study of reproducible transcriptomic changes in space-flown C. elegans (Willis et al., 2020) identified downregulated genes predicted to be under the control of the transcription factor NSY-7, which is involved in determination of neuronal left/right asymmetry (Lesch et al., 2009). Together, these results suggest that spaceflight may influence the left/right asymmetries in the C. elegans nervous system and potentially affect side-specific neuronal functions. Exopher production is a relatively rare event under normal conditions (i.e., without a proteotoxic stress), and the majority of exophers are produced on adult days 2 and 3, followed by a reduction in abundance during midlife (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). In this study, we quantified the number of exophers present in middle-aged animals, a time window several days past the peak in exopher-genesis, and therefore, we cannot definitively draw comparisons to Earth samples regarding the effect of spaceflight on exopher production. We can, however, conclude that spaceflight did not induce any exopher-clearance problems in animals with GFP-labeled touch receptor neurons since we observed no abnormal accumulation of GFP fluorescence in middle-aged C. elegans. Debris originating in neurons accumulates in surrounding tissues of space-flown animals in the presence of a proteotoxic stress In the presence of a neuronal proteotoxic stress (i.e., in a line overexpressing mCherry in touch receptor neurons), we observed a surprising accumulation of mCherry fluorescence in the hypodermis (and other tissues) of space-flown animals. Given that mCherry is expressed exclusively in the touch receptor neurons, this fluorescence accumulation in the hypodermis strongly supports that mCherry extruded from touch receptor neurons by exophers and/or other processes is not efficiently cleared in the surrounding hypodermal tissue in space-flown animals. A major question that arises from our results is whether spaceflight increases the extrusion of neuronal trash in proteotoxic conditions or decreases the degradative/clearance ability of non-neuronal neighboring tissues (or a combination of both). We found a modest increase in the number of mCherry foci in the soma of certain touch receptor neurons exposed to the ISS environment, suggesting that neuronal protein aggregation may be enhanced by spaceflight. This, in turn, could increase the extrusion of neuronal trash (e.g. aggregates) through exophers. We did not identify more exophers in space-flown, mCherry-expressing touch receptor neurons when compared to ground control neurons, but, as discussed above, our quantification occurred in middle-aged animals rather than at the peak of exopher-genesis (adult days 2 and 3). Additionally, given that exopher identification is based on the presence of large fluorescent vesicles nearby the neuron cell body, we likely missed several exophers in space-flown Pmec-4mCherry1 animals due to masking by all the extra fluorescence present. Regardless of a putative increase in neuronal trash extrusion by spaceflight, the remarkable mCherry accumulation throughout the body of over 60% of the space-flown animals indicates to us that the transcellular degradation/management of neuronal trash is severely compromised in the ISS environment. In mammals, glial cells play a vital role in the central nervous system in the elimination of waste proteins and metabolites produced by neurons (Jessen et al., 2015; Lim and Yue, 2015; Weber and Barros, 2015). These non-neuronal cells maintain homeostasis in the brain, and their dysregulation can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease. In fact, microglia and astrocytes play critical roles in the regulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance and degradation (Ries and Sastre, 2016). In the case of C. elegans, touch receptor neurons are fully surrounded by hypodermal tissue, and therefore, the hypodermis assumes an analogous function to mammalian glia regarding the clearance of neuronal waste. Even though we were unable to definitively identify the hypodermal structures in which mCherry fluorescence accumulates in response to spaceflight, it is striking that the large rounded fluorescent structures (sVesicles) resemble enlarged hypodermal lysosomes found in animals defective in lysosomal function and assembly (Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, the small fluorescent particles (Starry Night) have been previously described as neuron-derived mCherry that becomes dispersed in the hypodermal lysosomal network (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). Thus, our results suggest that transcellular management of neuronal waste by the hypodermis is defective in space-flown animals, leading to accumulation of impaired degradative organelles such as lysosomes. Our observations also suggest that the inability to efficiently clear neuronal trash is associated with the aging process given the absence of fluorescence accumulation in space-flown young adult animals that were escapers in our study. On Earth, mCherry extruded from neurons that cannot be digested by the hypodermis is re-released by the hypodermis into the C. elegans pseudocoelom and taken up for degradation by scavenger cells called coelomocytes (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). Interestingly, despite the accumulation of mCherry throughout the body of space-flown animals, we rarely found mCherry fluorescence in coelomocytes, suggesting a defect in hypodermal re-release or an uptake problem in coelomocytes. Alternatively, a distinct debris uptake pathway in other tissues like intestine might be induced in response to spaceflight, so that extruded material is handled differently from neuronal waste on Earth. Autophagy is a conserved lysosomal-dependent degradative pathway that is critical for cellular homeostasis and has been shown to increase in response to spaceflight or simulated microgravity in multiple cell types, such as muscle (Ryu et al., 2014), bone (Sambandam et al., 2014), liver (Blaber et al., 2017), kidney (Ryu et al., 2014), endothelial (Locatelli et al., 2020), and cancer (Ferranti et al., 2014; Fukazawa et al., 2019; Jeong et al., 2018) cells. However, to the best of our knowledge, nothing is known about the effect of spaceflight on autophagy or other degradative pathways in glial cells. Our results may even be consistent with an increase in autophagy markers in the hypodermis of space-flown animals, but the final steps of degradation seem to stall at some point leading to the accumulation of waste-filled vesicles. Future missions should address the impact of spaceflight on glial clearance pathways, particularly in the presence of proteostressors such as neurodegenerative disease proteins tau, Aβ, huntingtin, or alpha-synuclein. What are the consequences of spaceflight to neuronal function? In this study, we show that spaceflight can promote significant morphological changes in adult neurons and affect the clearance of neuronal trash from the surrounding tissues. Despite microgravity being the major difference experienced by space-flown animals compared to ground control animals, we cannot exclude other environmental factors (e.g. radiation) as partially responsible for the observed phenotypes. The impact of these changes to neuronal function remains in question; however, our results raise the intriguing possibility that long-duration spaceflights may affect brain function due to neuronal morphological remodeling and deficits in waste degradation. Interestingly, the recent National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) twins study found that the twin astronaut that spent 1 year onboard the ISS exhibited post-flight decline in cognitive performance when compared to his identical brother who remained on Earth (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Future missions will need to carefully address the impact of spaceflight on overall brain structure and function to properly assess the risks of long-duration missions planned for the medium future to take humans to Mars and beyond. Limitations of the study Our study reveals how spaceflight can affect adult neuronal morphology and the response to extruded neuronal waste. However, we were unable to mechanistically dissect these phenotypes given the inability to send new samples to the ISS on a regular basis. Future missions will be essential to clarify how consistent these adaptations to spaceflight are and to further explore the molecular, cellular, and tissue responses to spaceflight. In addition, even though C. elegans provides unique opportunities to identify in vivo single-neuron responses to spaceflight, future studies in mammalian models and ultimately in humans will be required to assess the risks of long-duration spaceflight and to develop countermeasures for safe space exploration.

Copyright notice ID: 7890410 PMID: 33659873 Summary Extended space travel is a goal of government space agencies and private companies. However, spaceflight poses risks to human health, and the effects on the nervous system have to be better characterized. Here, we exploited the unique experimental advantages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to explore how spaceflight affects adult neurons in vivo. We found that animals that lived 5 days of adulthood on the International Space Station exhibited hyperbranching in PVD and touch receptor neurons. We also found that, in the presence of a neuronal proteotoxic stress, spaceflight promotes a remarkable accumulation of neuronal-derived waste in the surrounding tissues, suggesting an impaired transcellular degradation of debris released from neurons. Our data reveal that spaceflight can significantly affect adult neuronal morphology and clearance of neuronal trash, highlighting the need to carefully assess the risks of long-duration spaceflight on the nervous system and to develop adequate countermeasures for safe space exploration.

Yuri Gagarin first showed in 1961 that humans could survive in space, and Neil Armstrong and Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin became the first to walk on the moon in 1969. Now, the International Space Station (ISS), a multinational collaborative station that orbits Earth, has been continuously occupied with crew since November 2000. Into the future, both governmental space agencies and private companies plan to send crewed missions to Mars and beyond. Research to date, however, makes evident that spaceflight poses health risks to the human body, including detrimental effects to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems (Crucian et al., 2018; Fitts et al., 2001; Shen and Frishman, 2019; Sibonga, 2013; Williams et al., 2009). Particularly striking is the loss of up to 20% of muscle mass in short-duration spaceflights (Adams et al., 2003; Edgerton et al., 1995), which can be ameliorated by regular physical exercise (Loehr et al., 2015). Much less is known about the effects of spaceflight on neuronal morphology and function, especially in vivo and at the single-neuron level. Given the impracticality of conducting such studies in humans, the use of animal models in which detailed high-resolution neuronal analyses can be performed is invaluable for assessing conserved neuronal responses to spaceflight and developing effective countermeasures to mitigate the consequences of long-duration missions. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetic model widely used in neurobiology, aging, and stress research that is amenable for assessing the effects of spaceflight on neuronal biology given its unique advantages: ease of culture in large numbers due to its microscopic size; a transparent body that permits in vivo imaging of multiple tissues, single cells, and even cellular organelles; and a short lifespan (2–3 weeks) that allows for even a short-duration spaceflight mission to correspond to a large portion of the C. elegans lifetime. Importantly, the spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy observed in humans is conserved in C. elegans, as several studies reported a downregulation of muscular components in space-flown nematodes (Adenle et al., 2009; Higashibata et al., 2006, 2016; Selch et al., 2008). The aging C. elegans musculature also displays the fundamental characteristics of human sarcopenia (the pervasive age-associated loss of muscle mass and strength that contributes to human frailty) (Herndon et al., 2002), and physical exercise in C. elegans mimics human exercise by inducing multi-systemic health benefits (Hartman et al., 2018; Laranjeiro et al., 2017, 2019). In addition to muscle changes, space-flown C. elegans have altered metabolism and differential expression of longevity-related genes (Adenle et al., 2009; Higashibata et al., 2016; Honda et al., 2012; Selch et al., 2008). The C. elegans nervous system is composed of exactly 302 neurons, each one with a well-described morphology. Thus, transgenic nematodes in which neuronal subpopulations are fluorescently labeled allow for in vivo single-neuron assessments that are virtually impossible in the highly complex mammalian brain. Here, we show that adult C. elegans that lived 5 days on the ISS exhibit morphological changes in two distinct types of sensory neurons when compared to ground control animals. We identify hyperbranching as a common response of adult neurons to spaceflight. We also studied proteostressed touch neurons with a focus on a formerly unrecognized mechanism by which C. elegans neurons can extrude large membrane-surrounded vesicles that contain neuronal waste (e.g. protein aggregates and damaged organelles) (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). On Earth, the extruded neurotoxic components are, in most cases, efficiently degraded by the surrounding tissues, which in the case studied is the nematode hypodermis (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). We find that, under spaceflight conditions, proteostressed neurons are associated with a striking accumulation of neuronal debris in the surrounding tissues not apparent in ground controls, indicating a severe dysregulation in the ability to clear neuronal waste in space-flown, middle-aged animals. Our results reveal spaceflight-associated challenges to systemic proteostasis and underscore the need to carefully assess the cellular consequences of long-duration spaceflight as strategies to maintain health are developed.Results A spaceflight protocol that features adult-only C. elegans culture and enables analysis of microgravity impact on a cohort that spans early adult life to middle age For all experiments presented in this study, we grew C. elegans in a liquid culture of S-Basal with freeze-dried E. coli OP50 as a food source. Prior to launch, we cultured synchronized populations of young adult nematodes that we loaded into polyethylene (PE) bags with 6.5 mL of liquid culture (∼300 animals/bag) on December 2, 2018 (see detailed optimization of culture conditions (Pollard et al., 2020)). Importantly, given our goal of assessing the effects of spaceflight during adult life rather than during animal development, we added 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FUdR) to the culture bags to suppress production of progeny and to guarantee that the animals we loaded into the bags would be the same ones we scored upon their return to Earth, as opposed to their progeny. Our samples were loaded into SpaceX CRS-16, the 16th Commercial Resupply Service mission to the ISS, and launched on December 5, 2018 aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX CRS-16 docked to the ISS on December 8, 2018, and the C. elegans samples, which were kept in cold stowage (8–13°C) once introduced into their flight bags, were transferred to 20°C for five days, beginning on December 9, 2018. After five days, the C. elegans culture bags were transferred to −80°C and kept frozen until return to Earth (Figure 1). For ground control samples, we loaded young adult nematodes into PE bags on December 5, 2018 and exposed C. elegans to the same time frame/temperatures as space samples but maintained cultures on Earth. A key aspect of our experimental design is thus that we generated middle-aged nematodes that experienced most of their physiological aging in microgravity (ISS) vs. normal gravity (Earth). Figure 1. Open in a new tab A spaceflight protocol to assess microgravity impact on C. elegans adult life Diagram showing the timeline of C. elegans life at 20°C, with approximately 2.5 days of embryonic and larval development and approximately three weeks (21 days) of adulthood. We indicate in red the crucial events in our experimental design by which we obtained middle-aged animals that experienced most of their physiological aging on the International Space Station (ISS). Note that C. elegans were kept in cold stowage (8–13°C) for approximately 7 days, relatively low temperatures that significantly delayed progression through adult stages. We estimated the cold stowage period to correspond to approximately 3 days at 20°C. After 5 days on the ISS at 20°C, samples were frozen and returned to Earth for analysis.Spaceflight induces morphological remodeling of adult PVD sensory neurons We started by studying the effects of spaceflight in the morphology of PVD sensory neurons, polymodal nociceptors with spectacular morphologies that sense harsh touch (Way and Chalfie, 1989), cold temperature (Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010), and posture (Albeg et al., 2011). The two PVD neurons (one on the left side and one on the right side of the body) extend processes that branch to cover most of the body and, together with FLP neurons in the head, possess the most complex dendritic arborization structure of all C. elegans neurons (Figure 2A). The highly branched, yet stereotyped, morphology of PVD dendrites arises sequentially during larval development, with primary (1°) branches forming during the L2 stage, secondary (2°) and tertiary (3°) branches forming during the L3 stage, and quaternary (4°) branches forming during the early L4 stage (Oren-Suissa et al., 2010). By the late L4 stage, PVD patterning is completed, and the repetitive structural units resembling candelabras or menorahs become apparent (Figure 2A). Figure 2. Open in a new tab The PVD dendritic tree is affected by spaceflight (A) Diagram showing the morphology of adult PVD sensory neurons. The characteristic PVD branches that form during larval development (1°–4° branches) to produce the repetitive structural units called menorahs are indicated in red. We performed all quantifications in the 100 μm anterior to the PVD cell body as depicted by the blue dashed box. A, anterior; P, posterior.

(D) Number of 2°, 3°, and 4° branches in ground control and spaceflight PVD neurons. Number of animals used for analysis: nControl = 51, nSpace = 56. We determined statistical significance by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean.We used a C. elegans strain in which PVD neurons express a translational fusion of transmembrane protein DES-2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (DES-2::GFP) (Oren-Suissa et al., 2010). All tiers of the PVD dendrites are well visualized by GFP in this strain, and approaches toward quantitative imaging of branching have been published (Kravtsov et al., 2017; Oren-Suissa et al., 2010, 2017). We compared PVD neurons from middle-aged space-flown vs. ground control animals by scoring 1°–4° branch structures. We found that the space-flown PVD neurons did not degenerate en masse nor did they exhibit major dendritic gaps relative to ground control PVD neurons (n = 51–56 PVD neurons/condition) (Figures 2B and 2C). However, when we carefully quantified the number of branches and other menorah-related phenotypes in a 100-μm domain anterior to the PVD soma (Figure 2A), we registered consistent differences between control and spaceflight animals. More specifically, space-flown animals exhibited increased numbers of 2° and 3° branches, whereas the number of 4° branches remained constant between control and spaceflight animals (Figure 2D), indicating a plastic morphological restructuring during adult life with outcome that differs consequent to microgravity experience. On Earth, the PVD dendritic pattern is established during larval stages, but adult neurons still exhibit a limited plasticity of the dendritic trees, with dynamic growth and retraction events occurring during lifetime (Kravtsov et al., 2017). Moreover, the PVD dendritic trees show age-dependent hyperbranching, disorganization, and loss of self-avoidance within tree branches (Kravtsov et al., 2017). Whether these changes reflect deleterious aspects of aging or adaptive processes as the animal grows remains unclear. With regard to spaceflight samples, our quantification of the number of extra branches derived from 4° branches (5°, 6°, and 7° branches) and the number of ectopic branches (ectopic 2°, 3°, and 4°) found that space-flown animals displayed an increased number of 5° branches (Figure 3A) and ectopic 3° branches (Figure 3B) relative to ground control animals. Retrograde branches (4° or higher-order branches that migrate toward the 3° branch by forming a hook) were also present at significantly higher numbers in spaceflight PVD neurons when compared to control counterparts (Figure 3C). We observed that spaceflight increased the proportion of disorganized menorahs (menorahs with extra/ectopic branches) (Figure 3D) and the proportion of self-avoidance defects (no gap in 3° branch between adjacent menorahs) (Figure 3E). PVD dendrites also exhibit age-associated degeneration characterized by the appearance of bead- or bubble-like structures along the dendrites, which are enriched in autophagosomes and fragmented microtubules (E et al., 2018). We focused on this morphological feature but found no difference in the number of beads/bubbles present in PVD dendrites of space-flown animals relative to ground control animals (Figure 3F). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Spaceflight promotes hyperbranching, disorganization, and self-avoidance defects in PVD sensory neurons (A–F) Quantifications in ground control and spaceflight PVD neurons of 5°, 6°, and 7° branches (A), ectopic 2°, ectopic 3°, and ectopic 4° branches (B), retrograde branches (C), disorganized menorahs (D), self-avoidance defects (E), and beads/bubbles (F). We highlight each PVD remodeling phenotype with a diagram (left panel) and a representative confocal image from DES-2::GFP animals (center panel). Number of animals used for analysis in A–E: nControl = 51, nSpace = 56. Number of animals used for analysis in F: nControl = 12, nSpace = 12 (we randomly selected 12 ground control and spaceflight animals for scoring; each point represents a single animal). We determined statistical significance by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test (A–C, F) and by Fisher’s exact test (D, E). ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean.Overall, our data reveal that spaceflight induces significant remodeling of the PVD dendritic tree in adult C. elegans without promoting neurodegeneration. Importantly, the morphological changes we report here for sensory neurons occurred during adult life, indicating that microgravity can influence the morphology of adult neurons.Spaceflight promotes modest morphological changes in adult touch receptor neurons The complex dendritic tree of PVD neurons contrasts with the simple morphology of a single unbranched process adopted by most C. elegans neurons (White et al., 1986). The six touch receptor neurons (AVM, ALML, ALMR, PVM, PLML, and PLMR) mediate the response to gentle touch, with each extending a single major dendritic process anteriorly (Chalfie and Sulston, 1981) (Figure 4A). We sought to investigate the effects of spaceflight on touch receptor neuron morphology by studying a C. elegans strain in which touch receptor neurons are specifically labeled with soluble GFP (Pmec-4GFP).

(E–G) Quantifications in ground control and spaceflight Pmec-4GFP animals of the number of branches (E), outgrowths (F), and exophers (G) in each of the six touch receptor neurons. We highlight each touch receptor neuron phenotype with a representative confocal image from Pmec-4GFP animals. Number of touch receptor neurons used for analysis: nControl = 54–61, nSpace = 60–64. Note that the different number of neurons used for analysis in each condition derives from the fact that, depending on the animal position during imaging, not all touch receptor neurons are visible in certain animals. We determined statistical significance by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. See also Figure S1.We found that middle-aged nematodes that lived five days of adulthood on the ISS exhibited touch receptor neurons with an overall morphology similar to ground control animals, with no obvious degeneration, dendritic gaps, or soma/process mislocalization (n = 54–64 of each touch receptor neuron/condition) (Figures 4B and 4C). For a detailed morphological characterization of each neuron, we quantified age-dependent morphological changes previously reported for touch receptor neurons (Toth et al., 2012), including new branches that extend from the main process (“branches”) and new processes emerging from the soma (“outgrowths”) (Figure 4D). We observed an overall trend in space-flown animals for increased number of branches in all six touch receptor neurons (statistically significant for ALMR and PLML) relative to ground control animals (Figure 4E), whereas we found the number of outgrowths was generally unchanged by spaceflight (except for PVM) (Figure 4F). Thus, C. elegans adult touch receptor neurons undergo minor structural changes consequent to space travel. Together, our data reveal that spaceflight during adult life does not promote major morphological changes in touch receptor neurons. Still, the hyperbranching phenotype detected in specific adult touch receptor neurons and the morphological changes observed in adult PVD neurons suggest that modest neuronal restructuring might constitute a general neuronal response to microgravity and/or other stresses associated with spaceflight.Spaceflight induces a distinctive response to neuronal mCherry extrusion Spaceflight includes novel stresses experienced by organisms during lift-off/reentry and extended microgravity periods, and some of these stresses have been suggested to contribute to accelerated aging (Demontis et al., 2017). Among the many stress response pathways activated and compromised by aging are proteostasis pathways such as autophagy and protein degradation processes (Kaushik and Cuervo, 2015). Although fluxes through such pathways are difficult to measure in spaceflight samples, we considered some physical readouts thought to reflect proteostasis status. Expression of GFP in touch receptor neurons can induce high-intensity fluorescent puncta in the soma (Figure 4D). We found that the absolute numbers of GFP puncta in touch neurons did not differ between middle-aged nematodes on Earth and the ones that spent the corresponding five days on the ISS (Figure S1A). However, we did observe a trend in space-flown animals for an increased proportion of large GFP puncta (diameter ≥0.9 μm) in the soma of touch receptor neurons as compared to ground control animals (Figure S1B). Although we cannot distinguish whether the touch neuron puncta correspond to aggregates, developing aggresomes, or liquid phase droplets, the differential handling of introduced GFP suggests physiological differences between Earth and spaceflight neurons. We also reasoned that we might readily evaluate one proteostress response using fluorescence imaging of marked neurons – the extrusion of neuronal garbage. Touch receptor neurons can extrude large membrane-surrounded vesicles called exophers that contain protein aggregates and organelles (Melentijevic et al., 2017) (Figure 4D). Exopher production increases under enhanced proteostress, as well as under environmental stresses such as elevated superoxide production (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017), possibly as a conserved protective mechanism of proteostasis. Under standard conditions, exopher production in GFP-labeled neurons is a relatively rare event (Melentijevic et al., 2017). We found that spaceflight did not significantly increase overall exopher detection in touch receptor neurons of Pmec-4GFP animals (Figure 4G). We did, however, note an interesting switch in the apparent rates of exopher production in individual touch receptor neurons. On Earth, adult ALMR neurons reproducibly produce more baseline exophers than other neurons, including the left side counterpart ALML (Melentijevic et al., 2017), but in spaceflight animals, left side ALML produced more baseline exophers (Figure 4G). Our observations raise the possibility that maintained gravitational forces may influence left/right asymmetries associated with stresses or their management in particular neurons. GFP-expressing touch receptor neurons have been studied extensively and are not thought to experience any particular stress as a consequence of the GFP expression (Chalfie et al., 1994; Herndon et al., 2002). Other transgenically supplied reporters such as mCherry can appear disruptive to normal physiology and are associated with an enhanced level of selective extrusion in exophers (Melentijevic et al., 2017). We wondered whether “at risk” neurons, pre-sensitized by the genetic introduction of a noxious mCherry-induced proteostress, might be impacted by spaceflight. Thus, we examined space-flown animals of a strain that over-produces an mCherry reporter well characterized to elevate the production of exophers in touch receptor neurons (Pmec-4mCherry1) (Melentijevic et al., 2017). We examined the neuronal morphology, apparent protein aggregation, and exopher-genesis in the presence of the mCherry stressor. We found that touch receptor neurons of space-flown Pmec-4mCherry1 animals exhibited a generally normal neuronal morphology (n = 42–66 of each touch receptor neuron/condition). We observed a trend in spaceflight animals for increased number of mCherry foci in the soma of specific touch receptor neurons (AVM, ALMR, PLML, and statistically significant in PLMR) relative to ground control animals (Figure S2A), whereas we detected no significant differences in the proportion of large internal mCherry foci (diameter ≥0.9 μm) between both conditions (Figure S2B). We found no significant differences in the absolute number of exophers present in middle-aged control vs. spaceflight touch neurons (Figure S2C). We did, however, observe a striking difference in mCherry reporter signal present outside the touch receptor neurons: a remarkably large proportion of Pmec-4mCherry1 animals that spent 5 days of adulthood on the ISS contained numerous mCherry-fluorescent structures throughout the body, a phenotype we never observed in ground control animals (Figures 5A, 5B, and S3). While exophers produced by ground control animals are found almost exclusively near touch receptor neuron cell bodies, in limited numbers (one or two exophers produced at the most per neuron), and with characteristic sizes (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017), fluorescent structures in space-flown animals ranged from small particles to large rounded structures that could appear as a continuous layer covering multiple regions of the body (Figures 5B and S3). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Spaceflight leads to accumulation of neuronal-derived mCherry throughout the body of middle-aged nematodes (A and B) Representative confocal images of ground control (A) and spaceflight (B) Pmec-4mCherry1 animals. Scale bars, 10 μm. See also Figures S2 and S3.C. elegans touch receptor neurons run through and are fully surrounded by hypodermal tissue. When exophers are extruded, they must therefore enter the hypodermis, which attempts digestion of exopher contents via its extensive lysosomal network. mCherry exopher contents that cannot be digested in the surrounding hypodermis are eventually extruded from the hypodermis into the C. elegans pseudocoelom. Materials floating through the pseudocoelom can be taken up by scavenger cells called coelomocytes (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). During the process of transit through the hypodermis, the mCherry exopher contents often become dispersed in the hypodermal lysosomal network, appearing as small fluorescent particles (we refer to this as a “Starry Night” phenotype) (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). The unexpected distribution of fluorescence that we observed in spaceflight Pmec-4mCherry1 animals appears comprised of two main components (Figure 6A): small fluorescent particles resembling the Starry Night phenotype and large rounded fluorescent structures (“spaceflight vesicles” or “sVesicles”) that we have not previously found in this C. elegans strain under standard culture conditions (even in much older adults) (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). These large rounded structures have the appearance of the enlarged hypodermal lysosomes that can be found in C. elegans mutants defective in lysosomal function and assembly (Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019).

We scored Starry Night and sVesicles as “anterior” if location was anterior to the AVM neuron, “mid” if location was in between the AVM and the PVM neurons, and “posterior” if location was posterior to the PVM neuron. We scored tissue location by imaging different planes on each animal; “hypodermal” corresponded to the peripheral layer surrounding the body, “intestinal” corresponded to the cells surrounding the intestinal lumen, and “other” corresponded to locations in the body not easily identifiable. We randomly selected a subgroup of spaceflight Pmec-4mCherry1 animals to score the location of Starry Night and sVesicles in the anterior-posterior body axis and in different tissues. (H) Confocal image of a spaceflight Pmec-4mCherry1 animal showing the variation in fluorescence intensity of sVesicles. Scale bar, 10 μm. See also Figure S4.We characterized the presence and location of both Starry Night and sVesicles in our samples. We found a striking increase in the proportion of animals with Starry Night in control vs. spaceflight (7% vs. 67%) (Figure 6B). In ground control animals, we always found Starry Night in the mid-body and in the hypodermis (peripheral layer surrounding the body) (Figures 6C and 6D). In space-flown animals, we still found Starry Night predominantly in the mid-body, but in approximately half of the cases, the Starry Night dispersed fluorescence expanded into the anterior and/or the posterior region of the body (Figure 6C). Regarding tissue location, we detected that Starry Night after spaceflight was always present in the hypodermis (Videos S1 and S2) but could also spread into the intestine (15% of animals) or other tissues (48% of animals) (Figure 6D). We did not observe sVesicles in any of the 72 ground control animals analyzed, whereas 52 out of the 83 space-flown animals (63%) exhibited sVesicles (Figure 6E). The location distribution of sVesicles in spaceflight animals was similar to Starry Night location, with sVesicles found predominantly in the mid-body but also in the anterior and posterior regions of the body (Figure 6F), and the primarily hypodermal location (Videos S1 and S2) extended into the intestine (7% of animals) or other tissues (56% of animals) (Figure 6G). Despite the extensive mCherry fluorescence found outside the touch receptor neurons in spaceflight animals, we rarely observed mCherry fluorescence in coelomocytes in this sample (only 1 out of 56 animals). The similar distribution patterns of Starry Night and sVesicles, together with the fact that 96% of the animals that exhibited sVesicles also had Starry Night, strongly support a link between both phenomena.

Download video file (4.4MB, flv) We tried to identify the sVesicles found in spaceflight nematodes by performing antibody staining for the lysosomal marker LMP-1 but were unable to get specific staining, possibly due to the paraformaldehyde fixation that we had to perform when thawing the frozen nematodes (essential to maintain a strong fluorescence from reporters). Moreover, it appeared that the sVesicles could be readily disrupted as we found that alternative fixation methods (e.g. methanol and acetic acid) led to the disappearance of most mCherry fluorescence outside the touch receptor neurons. The fragility of the sVesicle structures limited our ability to definitively confirm the nature of the hypodermal structures we observed. We did find that the fluorescence intensity of the sVesicles varied greatly, ranging from a bright to a diffuse, dim fluorescence (Figure 6H), which is consistent with sVesicles being at different stages of lysosomal degradation. We were fortunate that an unanticipated feature of the flight population enabled us to compare mCherry distribution in some escaper progeny in the culture bag from the ISS. We found that despite our use of FUdR to limit reproduction, some progeny were able to develop up to young adulthood. We could easily identify these animals from older adults by their reduced size. Young adult animals present in the same culture bag as the middle-aged adults that were our major focus exhibited the fluorescent structures at extremely low levels (Figure S4), suggesting that the dramatic sVesicle profiles in the hypodermis could be age dependent. We cannot rule out, however, that a variable introduced during development in spaceflight could be responsible for the lack of the large sVesicle pattern in younger animals. Overall, our data reveal that, in the presence of an internal cell-specific proteotoxic stress (i.e., mCherry overexpression in touch receptor neurons), spaceflight is associated with significant extrusion of the offensive protein in middle-aged touch receptor neurons. Unexpectedly, the extruded material appears to become stuck in the hypodermal lysosomal network, and the lysosomal network adopts a morphology similar to that observed when lysosomes are unable to degrade their substrates. Our data suggest that in microgravity, extruded neuronal garbage is not handled as efficiently by the neighboring cell that collects neuronal debris and attempts degradation. Future experiments will be necessary to determine the exact mechanism causing mCherry accumulation in large quantities in multiple tissues of C. elegans consequent to spaceflight. Still, it is interesting that our results suggest that spaceflight can increase mCherry spread from touch receptor neurons to neighboring tissues (via exophers and/or unknown mechanisms) and that these significant extrusions are not processed in neighboring tissues as occurs on Earth. The abnormal fluorescent structures observed primarily in the hypodermis suggest that the degradative pathways of middle-aged animals may become overwhelmed in response to spaceflight with the resulting inability to quickly clear neuronal trash. Thus, in upcoming spaceflight missions, it will be fascinating to specifically track the hypodermal lysosomal network and to determine whether other proteostressors such as aggregation-prone human neurodegenerative disease proteins tau, amyloid beta, huntingtin, or alpha-synuclein promote similar distinctive outcomes.Discussion Spaceflight has been shown to induce adverse effects on the human body at multiple levels, including in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems (Crucian et al., 2018; Fitts et al., 2001; Shen and Frishman, 2019; Sibonga, 2013; Williams et al., 2009). However, the effect of spaceflight on neuronal morphology and function, especially in vivo, is largely unknown. In this study, we took advantage of the unique characteristics of the nematode C. elegans (e.g. ease of culture in large numbers and transparent body allowing for in vivo imaging of fluorescently labeled transgenic lines) to address how spaceflight affects the morphology of different adult neurons and the response to a neuronal proteotoxic stress. We show that spaceflight induces extensive remodeling of the PVD dendritic tree in adult C. elegans relative to ground control animals, whereas touch receptor neurons exhibit modest morphological changes in response to spaceflight. Importantly, hyperbranching is a consistent response to spaceflight between different adult neuron types. We also report on a striking difference in the ability to respond to a neuronal proteostress (i.e., mCherry overexpression) in spaceflight vs. Earth samples, in which adults that aged on the ISS exhibited accumulated extruded neuronal garbage outside the neurons, distributed in neighboring tissues. Our observations raise the intriguing possibility that spaceflight may impair neuronal proteostasis/clearance pathways, which may hold significant health implications for long-duration spaceflights. Spaceflight promotes remodeling of complex adult dendritic trees We found that spaceflight promoted hyperbranching, disorganization, and loss of self-avoidance in middle-aged PVD neurons. These phenotypes have been shown to increase during aging in C. elegans (Kravtsov et al., 2017), raising the possibility that space-flown animals experienced accelerated aging compared to ground control counterparts. However, we observed no increase in space-flown animals of age-associated PVD degeneration (i.e. number of beads/bubbles), which is tightly linked to the functional aging of PVD neurons (E et al., 2018). Adult animals with disorganized PVD dendritic trees rarely show defects in response to harsh touch (E et al., 2018; Kravtsov et al., 2017), suggesting that changes in dendritic architecture are not necessarily a deleterious aspect of aging but rather might be part of normal neuronal maintenance and an adaptive response to intrinsic/extrinsic cues. Furthermore, in other models, most physiological changes induced by spaceflight are reversed upon return to Earth and therefore can be considered physiological adaptations to the spaceflight environment (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Honda et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2009). Thus, we hypothesize that the PVD remodeling we describe here is more likely an adaptive change to spaceflight conditions rather than an overall increase in aging rate. Testing this hypothesis is a challenge for spaceflight experiments as the C. elegans lifespan is shorter than typical missions. A complex cross talk between muscle, skin (hypodermis), and PVD neurons defines the pattern of higher-order branches in the PVD dendritic tree (Diaz-Balzac et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2015; Salzberg et al., 2013; Yang and Chien, 2019; Zhu et al., 2017). Briefly, the extracellular matrix protein UNC-52/Perlecan forms regular stripes by following the location of the dense bodies of sarcomeres and is essential for the formation of regular hypodermal hemidesmosomes, which are the attachments that mechanically link the hypodermis to the muscle. The intermediate filament MUA-6, which is a component of the hemidesmosome, patterns the transmembrane cell adhesion molecule SAX-7/L1CAM in hypodermal stripes by locally excluding SAX-7 from the regions where MUA-6 is present. Then, SAX-7 physically interacts with the transmembrane receptor DMA-1 in PVD neurons to instruct the growth of 4° branches. Given the well-established and conserved role of spaceflight in muscle degeneration (Adenle et al., 2009; Fitts et al., 2001; Higashibata et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2009), we propose that PVD dendritic morphology in space-flown C. elegans may be indirectly affected by changes at the body wall muscle level. In fact, microgravity in C. elegans has been shown to downregulate the expression of multiple muscle dense body genes and intermediate filament genes, including mua-6 (Higashibata et al., 2016). Areas where MUA-6 is absent have abnormally shaped PVD dendrites (Liang et al., 2015), suggesting that the downregulation of muscle structural genes together with mua-6 by microgravity could contribute to the changes we observed in space-flown PVD neurons, particularly the hyperbranching, menorah disorganization, and increase in retrograde branches. Spaceflight has also been suggested to reduce insulin signaling in C. elegans (Honda et al., 2012; Selch et al., 2008), whereas the insulin/IGF-1 receptor daf-2 mutant exhibits an increase in PVD 2° branches (Gioran et al., 2014) and self-avoidance defects (Kravtsov et al., 2017). Thus, a putative modulation in insulin signaling in space-flown C. elegans might contribute to some of the PVD remodeling phenotypes that we describe in this study.Hyperbranching may be a conserved response of adult neurons to spaceflight We found that space-flown C. elegans exhibited touch receptor neurons with modest morphological changes (i.e., hyperbranching) when compared to ground control animals. Interestingly, impaired mitochondrial respiration increases branching in both touch receptor neurons and PVD neurons (Gioran et al., 2014), akin to our observations after spaceflight. Moreover, spaceflight in C. elegans has been shown to induce a metabolic shift (Adenle et al., 2009; Selch et al., 2008) and decrease the expression of numerous enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and of all electron transport chain complexes (Higashibata et al., 2016), strongly indicating that mitochondrial respiration is reduced during spaceflight. Therefore, changes in mitochondrial function during spaceflight may contribute to the hyperbranching phenotype that we described in different adult neuronal cell types. The subtle morphological changes induced by spaceflight in touch receptor neurons contrasted with an extensive remodeling of the PVD dendritic tree. This difference in response to spaceflight can be explain by the innate morphology of each neuron (i.e., the highly branched dendritic tree of PVD neurons allows for the detection of multiple morphological abnormalities vs. a single unbranched process of touch receptor neurons), the stimuli sensed by each neuron (i.e., PVD neurons may sense microgravity more directly than touch receptor neurons given their role in proprioception (Albeg et al., 2011)), and/or the fact that PVD morphology is indirectly affected by changes at the muscle level (as discussed previously). Despite the differences between neuron types, our results suggest hyperbranching as a common neuronal adaptive response to spaceflight. This response may in fact be conserved from C. elegans to mammals given that Septin 7, a GTP-binding protein critical for dendrite branching (Xie et al., 2007), has been shown to be significantly upregulated in the brain of mice exposed to the ISS environment for 3 months (Santucci et al., 2012).Clearance of neuronal waste is not affected by spaceflight in normal conditions In addition to neuronal morphological changes, we also assessed how spaceflight modulated the extrusion of neuronal garbage by touch receptor neurons, with a focus on the potential extrusion of large membrane-surrounded vesicles called exophers (Melentijevic et al., 2017). We found that GFP-labeled touch receptor neurons, which are not thought to be stressed by transgene expression, exhibited an overall similar number of detectable exophers in middle-aged animals exposed to the ISS vs. Earth environment. It is interesting that for GFP-labeled anterior touch neurons, we measured a difference in the left-right asymmetry in exopher production levels. On Earth, the ALM neuron on the right side of the body (ALMR) consistently produces more exophers than the left side ALM neuron (ALML) (Melentijevic et al., 2017). However, in space-flown animals, we observed a reversal in exopher-genesis rate between ALMR and ALML neurons. Although the reason underlying this reversal is unclear, a recent study of reproducible transcriptomic changes in space-flown C. elegans (Willis et al., 2020) identified downregulated genes predicted to be under the control of the transcription factor NSY-7, which is involved in determination of neuronal left/right asymmetry (Lesch et al., 2009). Together, these results suggest that spaceflight may influence the left/right asymmetries in the C. elegans nervous system and potentially affect side-specific neuronal functions. Exopher production is a relatively rare event under normal conditions (i.e., without a proteotoxic stress), and the majority of exophers are produced on adult days 2 and 3, followed by a reduction in abundance during midlife (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). In this study, we quantified the number of exophers present in middle-aged animals, a time window several days past the peak in exopher-genesis, and therefore, we cannot definitively draw comparisons to Earth samples regarding the effect of spaceflight on exopher production. We can, however, conclude that spaceflight did not induce any exopher-clearance problems in animals with GFP-labeled touch receptor neurons since we observed no abnormal accumulation of GFP fluorescence in middle-aged C. elegans.Debris originating in neurons accumulates in surrounding tissues of space-flown animals in the presence of a proteotoxic stress In the presence of a neuronal proteotoxic stress (i.e., in a line overexpressing mCherry in touch receptor neurons), we observed a surprising accumulation of mCherry fluorescence in the hypodermis (and other tissues) of space-flown animals. Given that mCherry is expressed exclusively in the touch receptor neurons, this fluorescence accumulation in the hypodermis strongly supports that mCherry extruded from touch receptor neurons by exophers and/or other processes is not efficiently cleared in the surrounding hypodermal tissue in space-flown animals. A major question that arises from our results is whether spaceflight increases the extrusion of neuronal trash in proteotoxic conditions or decreases the degradative/clearance ability of non-neuronal neighboring tissues (or a combination of both). We found a modest increase in the number of mCherry foci in the soma of certain touch receptor neurons exposed to the ISS environment, suggesting that neuronal protein aggregation may be enhanced by spaceflight. This, in turn, could increase the extrusion of neuronal trash (e.g. aggregates) through exophers. We did not identify more exophers in space-flown, mCherry-expressing touch receptor neurons when compared to ground control neurons, but, as discussed above, our quantification occurred in middle-aged animals rather than at the peak of exopher-genesis (adult days 2 and 3). Additionally, given that exopher identification is based on the presence of large fluorescent vesicles nearby the neuron cell body, we likely missed several exophers in space-flown Pmec-4mCherry1 animals due to masking by all the extra fluorescence present. Regardless of a putative increase in neuronal trash extrusion by spaceflight, the remarkable mCherry accumulation throughout the body of over 60% of the space-flown animals indicates to us that the transcellular degradation/management of neuronal trash is severely compromised in the ISS environment. In mammals, glial cells play a vital role in the central nervous system in the elimination of waste proteins and metabolites produced by neurons (Jessen et al., 2015; Lim and Yue, 2015; Weber and Barros, 2015). These non-neuronal cells maintain homeostasis in the brain, and their dysregulation can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease. In fact, microglia and astrocytes play critical roles in the regulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance and degradation (Ries and Sastre, 2016). In the case of C. elegans, touch receptor neurons are fully surrounded by hypodermal tissue, and therefore, the hypodermis assumes an analogous function to mammalian glia regarding the clearance of neuronal waste. Even though we were unable to definitively identify the hypodermal structures in which mCherry fluorescence accumulates in response to spaceflight, it is striking that the large rounded fluorescent structures (sVesicles) resemble enlarged hypodermal lysosomes found in animals defective in lysosomal function and assembly (Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, the small fluorescent particles (Starry Night) have been previously described as neuron-derived mCherry that becomes dispersed in the hypodermal lysosomal network (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). Thus, our results suggest that transcellular management of neuronal waste by the hypodermis is defective in space-flown animals, leading to accumulation of impaired degradative organelles such as lysosomes. Our observations also suggest that the inability to efficiently clear neuronal trash is associated with the aging process given the absence of fluorescence accumulation in space-flown young adult animals that were escapers in our study. On Earth, mCherry extruded from neurons that cannot be digested by the hypodermis is re-released by the hypodermis into the C. elegans pseudocoelom and taken up for degradation by scavenger cells called coelomocytes (Arnold et al., 2020; Melentijevic et al., 2017). Interestingly, despite the accumulation of mCherry throughout the body of space-flown animals, we rarely found mCherry fluorescence in coelomocytes, suggesting a defect in hypodermal re-release or an uptake problem in coelomocytes. Alternatively, a distinct debris uptake pathway in other tissues like intestine might be induced in response to spaceflight, so that extruded material is handled differently from neuronal waste on Earth. Autophagy is a conserved lysosomal-dependent degradative pathway that is critical for cellular homeostasis and has been shown to increase in response to spaceflight or simulated microgravity in multiple cell types, such as muscle (Ryu et al., 2014), bone (Sambandam et al., 2014), liver (Blaber et al., 2017), kidney (Ryu et al., 2014), endothelial (Locatelli et al., 2020), and cancer (Ferranti et al., 2014; Fukazawa et al., 2019; Jeong et al., 2018) cells. However, to the best of our knowledge, nothing is known about the effect of spaceflight on autophagy or other degradative pathways in glial cells. Our results may even be consistent with an increase in autophagy markers in the hypodermis of space-flown animals, but the final steps of degradation seem to stall at some point leading to the accumulation of waste-filled vesicles. Future missions should address the impact of spaceflight on glial clearance pathways, particularly in the presence of proteostressors such as neurodegenerative disease proteins tau, Aβ, huntingtin, or alpha-synuclein.What are the consequences of spaceflight to neuronal function? In this study, we show that spaceflight can promote significant morphological changes in adult neurons and affect the clearance of neuronal trash from the surrounding tissues. Despite microgravity being the major difference experienced by space-flown animals compared to ground control animals, we cannot exclude other environmental factors (e.g. radiation) as partially responsible for the observed phenotypes. The impact of these changes to neuronal function remains in question; however, our results raise the intriguing possibility that long-duration spaceflights may affect brain function due to neuronal morphological remodeling and deficits in waste degradation. Interestingly, the recent National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) twins study found that the twin astronaut that spent 1 year onboard the ISS exhibited post-flight decline in cognitive performance when compared to his identical brother who remained on Earth (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Future missions will need to carefully address the impact of spaceflight on overall brain structure and function to properly assess the risks of long-duration missions planned for the medium future to take humans to Mars and beyond.Limitations of the study Our study reveals how spaceflight can affect adult neuronal morphology and the response to extruded neuronal waste. However, we were unable to mechanistically dissect these phenotypes given the inability to send new samples to the ISS on a regular basis. Future missions will be essential to clarify how consistent these adaptations to spaceflight are and to further explore the molecular, cellular, and tissue responses to spaceflight. In addition, even though C. elegans provides unique opportunities to identify in vivo single-neuron responses to spaceflight, future studies in mammalian models and ultimately in humans will be required to assess the risks of long-duration spaceflight and to develop countermeasures for safe space exploration.Resource availability Lead contact Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Ricardo Laranjeiro (ricardo_laranjeiro@hotmail.com).Material availability All unique strains generated in this study are available from the lead contact without restriction.Data and code availability No large-scale data sets or codes were generated or analyzed in this study.

    "abstract": "Abstract Caenorhabditis elegans is a low-cost genetic model that has been flown to the International Space Station to investigate the influence of microgravity on changes in the expression of genes involved in muscle maintenance. These studies showed that genes that encode muscle attachment complexes have decreased expression under microgravity. However, it remains to be answered whether the decreased expression leads to concomitant changes in animal muscle strength, specifically across multiple generations. We recently reported the NemaFlex microfluidic device for the measurement of muscle strength of C. elegans (Rahman et al., Lab Chip, 2018). In this study, we redesign our original NemaFlex device and integrate it with flow control hardware for spaceflight investigations considering mixed animal culture, constraints on astronaut time, crew safety, and on-orbit operations. The technical advances we have made include (i) a microfluidic device design that allows animals of a given size to be sorted from unsynchronized cultures and housed in individual chambers, (ii) a fluid handling protocol for injecting the suspension of animals into the microfluidic device that prevents channel clogging, introduction of bubbles, and crowding of animals in the chambers, and (iii) a custom-built worm-loading apparatus interfaced with the microfluidic device that allows easy manipulation of the worm suspension and prevents fluid leakage into the surrounding environment. Collectively, these technical advances enabled the development of new microfluidics-integrated hardware for spaceflight studies in C. elegans. Finally, we report Earth-based validation studies to test this new hardware, which has led to it being flown to the International Space Station.

    "introduction": "Introduction Among the many pathophysiological changes that occur during human spaceflight, muscle atrophy is significant and remains a major impediment to deep space exploration1,2. The postural muscles are most affected in the microgravity environment, therefore, impacting the activities of astronauts in long-duration spaceflight missions. Even a weeklong stay at the International Space Station (ISS) can lead to degradation in muscle mass and peak power; this loss could be fatal in off-nominal landing scenarios where assistance might be unavailable. Loss of muscle strength can pose an even more serious problem for interplanetary travel, such as with a venture to Mars, which could take 200 to 300 days. Generally, reduced workload in a microgravity environment is considered to be a primary cause of muscle loss in response to spaceflight3–5. However, altered metabolism also plays a significant role6,7. For example, atrophy in flight is not limited to antigravity muscles but also occurs in vascular smooth muscles and cardiac muscles8–10. To combat muscular atrophy, astronauts exercise (aerobic and resistance) for up to 2.5 h each day. Even with these current countermeasures, the loss in muscle mass is up to 20% during a 5-day to 2-week-long flight, whereas for a long-duration space mission (3 to 6 months), a loss of 30% is noted3,11. In most cases, muscle mass and strength can be regained within a few months to years after returning to Earth by a combination of adapted exercise and rehabilitation11,12. Nevertheless, muscle maintenance in space is still a major concern, and no effective preventive measures exist beyond the limited benefit obtained through exercise. Thus, it is important to determine the mechanisms responsible for the loss of muscle strength in spaceflight and develop appropriate countermeasures. In previous studies, it was shown that alteration in gene expression (e.g., in genes encoding myosin heavy chain kinase and other cytoskeletal proteins) in response to microgravity is similar in cultured embryonic muscle cells1, animals (both vertebrate and invertebrate), and humans10,13. These similarities provide strong motivation for investigating the effect of spaceflight conditions on muscles using invertebrate animal models, thus avoiding the cost and time expense associated with experiments using vertebrates. Indeed, the invertebrate model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), has been recognized as an excellent model system for space biology research and has been flown in several spaceflight investigations14–19. The C. elegans model presents several advantages for spaceflight studies. Up to 40% of its genes are homologous to human genes20,21, and a large library of genetic mutants22 and strains with fluorescent reporters are available. The body wall muscles of C. elegans are functionally analogous to vertebrate muscle, as they include dense bodies and M-lines, the former being functionally equivalent to vertebrate Z-lines. In addition, the nematode is small (≈1 mm), weight is miniscule (≈1 μg), has a short lifespan (≈20 days), fast generation time (∼1 week), and is easy to grow. For spaceflight missions where payload size and weight are critical considerations, C. elegans experimental payloads offer a small form factor and a significant reduction in weight compared with vertebrates. Moreover, the fast reproductive cycle enables multi-generational studies to be conducted, providing an opportunity to explore physiological adaptations due to long-term habitation in space. These advantages and existing strain resources make C. elegans a leading invertebrate animal model for spaceflight studies. On Earth, adult C. elegans cultured in liquid media tend to sediment, indicating that animals experience gravitational stresses23,24. In microgravity, gravitational effects are significantly weaker, which alters C. elegans physiology13. In prior spaceflight experiments with C. elegans, it was found that approximately 150 muscle genes were downregulated in C. elegans during 10 days of culture in microgravity13,25. Among the detected downregulated muscle genes were key motor protein genes such as MyoD and myosin heavy chain, and two genes (unc-97 and unc-112) that encode members of a muscle attachment complex13. Members of the attachment complex (called the costamere in humans) have been shown in humans to increase expression and activity with increased mechanical load and decrease expression and activity in response to immobilization. Thus, muscle attachment genes play an important role in processes leading to muscle loss. In C. elegans on Earth, decreased expression of these genes via acute RNAi treatments results in movement defects and various subcellular defects within the muscle (e.g., disorganization and collapse of arrayed sarcomeres)26. A key open question is if and how the changes in muscle gene expression observed in spaceflight result in decreased muscle strength. While decreased force production is documented for astronauts, it is yet to be demonstrated for C. elegans cultured in microgravity. Several studies have used elastomeric micropillars to measure muscle forces in C. elegans27–29, and we have recently standardized a microfluidic device and approach for obtaining the maximum exertable force, providing a measure of nematode muscle strength. This strength measurement apparatus is called NemaFlex30,31 and consists of a microfluidic chamber with microfabricated deformable pillars. The force produced by a nematode moving between the pillars is evaluated from the pillar deflections observed under a microscope. The NemaFlex device and the force measurement protocol have been optimized such that muscle strength is independent of behavior and gait. The device is also capable of detecting strength differences in mutants with defects in muscle genes31,32. The NemaFlex device is miniaturized and simple to use, and thus has potential for C. elegans spaceflight experiments. In this study, we address technical challenges for conducting multi-generational C. elegans strength measurements in microgravity. These technical challenges include culturing of animals across several generations, obtaining nearly age-synchronized animals of a given size for strength measurements, establishment of an imaging protocol for recording pillar deflections, and development of an on-orbit protocol for experimentation that minimizes crew time and ensures astronaut safety on the ISS. Addressing these technical challenges, we report a reconfigured spaceflight ready NemaFlex device (referred to as NemaFlex-S), new protocols for experimentation with C. elegans, and a custom-designed hardware for on-orbit operation of NemaFlex-S on the ISS. This integrated technology and protocols enabled its successful operation by astronauts on the ISS producing significant visual data of C. elegans across multiple generations.",
    "methods": "Methods Worm culture preparation Wild-type Bristol isolate (N2) worms were maintained in CeMM (Cell Guidance Systems, Cambridge, UK). To start culturing the animals in CeMM, agar-grown animals were bleached, and the eggs were introduced into the CeMM. The stock culture was then maintained by transferring aliquots of animals to fresh CeMM before cultures became starved. For the initiation of NemaFlex experiments, approximately 1000 larvae from a stock culture were transferred into an FEP bag (Saint Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation, Ohio, USA) containing 20 mL of CeMM. The FEP bags were stored in the incubator at 20 ± 1 °C. A mixed population of the well-fed gravid adult animals was used for all force measurement experiments. Every other week, 1 mL aliquots from the culture bag were transferred to a new bag containing 19 mL of fresh CeMM to make a total of 20 mL to initiate the new subcultures. Thrashing assay To quickly assess the physical health of the animals, we performed a thrashing assay every other week. To measure the thrashing frequency, a 250-µL aliquot of worms was withdrawn from the culture bags and transferred into a Petri plate, and diluted with 2 mL of CeMM. The animals were left to acclimatize for 10 min. The number of body bends was manually counted under a dissecting microscope for 40 random individual worms for a period of 20 s at room temperature (20 ± 1 °C). Microfluidic device fabrication The micropillar-based NemaFlex-S device was fabricated using a 2-step soft lithography process. The mold was fabricated in SU-8 2050 negative photoresist (Microchem) on a 4” silicon wafer as a substrate. First, a 20-µm tall photoresist layer was fabricated, which forms the boundary of the NemaFlex chamber. On top of this layer, a second layer of 80 µm height was fabricated with cylindrical holes that form the micropillars. This two-layer approach provides a total chamber depth of approximately 100 µm and creates deformable pillars of height 80 µm. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices of thickness 4.25 ± 0.25 mm thick were cast using Sylgard 184 part A (base) and part B (curing agent) (Dow Corning) 10:1 by weight over the SU-8 mold by curing for ∼2 h at 70 ± 1 °C. Inlet, outlet, and air vent holes were cored with a 1 mm hole puncher (Accuderm, Florida, USA). The devices were thoroughly cleaned with scotch tape to remove any dirt before bonding. The PDMS replica was then treated in an air-plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY) for the 90 s and bonded to a 2”×3” glass slide. Bonding was done while ensuring the pillars did not collapse or deform. The bonded devices were immediately kept in the oven for 10 min at 70 ± 1 °C. Devices were then treated with 5 wt% Pluronic F127 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min to prevent any bacterial build-up and also to help reduce bubble formation during worm loading. After incubation, excess Pluronic was removed by washing the devices with DI water. The Pluronic-treated devices were soaked in DI water overnight at 20 ± 1 °C to release any air bubbles from the device. The PDMS devices were then integrated into WLA and kept in double Bitran bags and stored at ambient temperature until the day of the experiment. Image acquisition and processing The worms were loaded into NemaFlex-S chambers using the procedure described in the main text. The animals were allowed to habituate in the micropillar arena for approximately 10 min before imaging. One-minute-long videos of crawling worms were acquired with Nikon inverted microscope (Eclipse TS 100) at 4X magnification with a field of view of 1920 × 1080 pixels. All videos were recorded at a temperature of 22 ± 1 °C. The recorded movies were processed offline using custom routines written in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2018b) for quantitation of pillar displacements as discussed by Rahman et al.30. Worm diameters were measured manually using ImageJ 1.48 v. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.",
    "results": "Results C. elegans culture for multigenerational spaceflight studies The goal of our spaceflight experiment on ISS is to measure the strength of adult wild-type C. elegans at 4-time points across an 8-week period corresponding to 8 generations. This study design allows the evaluation of potential changes in muscle strength due to short and long-term muscle adaptation to the microgravity environment. In contrast to conducting experiments on Earth, spaceflight experiments present unique constraints that deserve special consideration. These constraints include crew time for conducting the experiments, maintaining sterile culture conditions, and the safety of the crew members and workstation at ISS. Therefore, while developing culturing and fluid handling protocols, the microfluidic device, and the worm loading apparatus, we considered these spaceflight constraints. The first challenge was to culture C. elegans for several generations on ISS. Table 1 lists the different space-flight missions with C. elegans, the culturing hardware, and the food source used in these studies. In typical laboratory conditions on Earth, C. elegans is cultured on nematode growth media (NGM) plates. Culturing C. elegans on NGM plates is generally labor-intensive as it requires manual picking of animals and transfers to new plates to maintain synchronized animal populations. Such laborious tasks consume significant crew time; therefore, the culture of C. elegans on NGM plates remains impractical for multigenerational studies in space. Table 1.

Although non-pathogenic E. coli OP50 is typically used as the food source, maintenance of defined bacterial population densities across the 8-week duration of our spaceflight experiment may present challenges since high bacterial density might limit oxygen availability for nematodes. C. elegans on NGM plates are used mostly in simulated microgravity on Earth33–35. C. elegans were flown to space on a standard agar-based nematode growth medium for a short duration of 10 to 20 days with different space missions36–39 as listed in Table 1. But the missions do not involve imaging onboard, therefore all the behavioral studies were conducted postflight. To overcome the issues discussed above, the wild-type worms were cultured in chemically defined liquid C. elegans maintenance media (CeMM)40. The safety and low-maintenance requirements make CeMM robust and appropriate media for multigenerational cultures on board the International Space Station. However, previous experiments show there are some differences between nematodes grown using NGM and CeMM40,41. In particular, C. elegans development is slower, progeny production is slower, and lifespan is increased in C. elegans cultured in CeMM compared with those cultured using NGM41. In addition, the culture vessels used to maintain C. elegans could impact their growth. Therefore, there was a need to optimize culture protocols in CeMM and in spaceflight compatible culture vessels to achieve consistent culture densities across multiple generations. The worms were maintained in CeMM in biocompatible Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) bags (Fig. 1a). These bags provide a solution for culturing C. elegans in liquid media since they are highly permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide while remaining impermeable to water42. An efficient and robust protocol was developed for culturing the animals to maintain the desired density across several generations to prevent overcrowding and ensure nutrient availability. A schematic of the culturing protocol for multigenerational studies in C. elegans is depicted in Fig. 1b. Primary bags (group 1) with approximately 1000 larvae/mL were prepared at day 0 and incubated at 20 ± 1 °C for 2 weeks. On week 2, a specified aliquot (1 mL) of the media with worms was transferred from this bag to a new bag that was prefilled with 19 mL of fresh CeMM. The new bag was incubated at 20 ± 1 °C, and the old bag was used for loading the worms into the NemaFlex-S device. The same culturing protocol was followed every other week for the remaining generations. No transfer was made on week 8. Fig. 1. C. elegans culture in CeMM and the multigenerational culture protocol.

Here, d0 represents day 0 (start of the culture), and w2, w4, w6, and w8 represent week 2, week 4, week 6, and week 8, respectively.The efficacy of the multigenerational culturing protocol discussed in Fig. 1b was evaluated by measuring animal density and locomotory health during the 8-week multigeneration experiment. Since the culture was not age-synchronized, we measured the density of adults, larvae, eggs, and dead animals in the FEP bags. In parallel, we also measured the thrashing frequency of gravid adults as a health measure. Both these measurements were conducted on weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the culture consisted of more than 1000 adults/mL, the approximate density needed for optimized loading into the NemaFlex-S device. The culture was also found to have several thousands of larvae and eggs, which shows good reproductive health and overall health of the animals in the culture. With regards to locomotory health, we find that the thrashing frequency is the same across all four-time points (Fig. 2b). Thus, the overall culture health is not compromised over the 8-week multigenerational experiment. Fig. 2.

Design of the NemaFlex-S microfluidic device Our concept for designing a spaceflight ready microfluidic device involved ideally housing individual animals in small chambers so that the astronaut performing the imaging can easily locate and record videos of animals, thereby reducing crew time. In recent years efforts have been made in studying the behavior of C. elegans in longitudinal chips43–46, worms were loaded automatically into these chips. Prior literature provides design guidance on how to house individual C. elegans in microfluidic chambers, however, these devices do not meet the needs of multigenerational space-flight studies. For example, Chung et al.43 and Le et al.44 designed a microfluidic device that had an array of connected chambers with tapered necks for individual animals to enter and be housed. Although these devices can successfully house individual animals, they were optimized for age-synchronized animals and not for mixed populations where progeny needs to be removed. Moreover, the chambers were not configured with flexible pillars, which makes them unsuitable for strength measurements. Additionally, in these Earth-based studies, worms were cultured on plates and then transferred to liquid media. Transferring the liquid culture in a microfluidic device in an open manner is not safe as it can lead to contamination of the workstation at ISS and possibly cause health hazards due to the presence of bacterial food. Building on this prior work, we considered additional criteria relevant to our spaceflight experiment that led to technical advances in engineering the NemaFlex-S device. These additional criteria include: (i) given that the culturing protocol generates a mixed population of animals, the device design should be capable of sorting and obtaining nearly age- and size-matched animals since muscle strength of C. elegans can vary with developmental stage and body size30, (ii) the pillar diameter and spacing should be modified to accommodate CeMM-grown animals, which are skinnier than bacteria-fed worms for whom the original NemaFlex deflectable pillar geometry was optimized, (iii) maximize the number of chambers with 1 to 2 animals so that the image-processing code can detect pillar deformations and cleanly associate it with the corresponding animal making those deflections, (iv) minimize entry of air bubbles or plugs into the pillar arena that can negatively impact animal loading and image processing, which ultimately can reduce collection of useful animal data from the space experiment, (v) allow a means for the crew on orbit to easily focus the microscope objective on the pillar rim which is crucial for the software to auto-detect the deflections, and (vi) establish a relatively simple chip-to-world interface so that the crew time is reduced for loading the animals into the individual pillar chambers. The layout of the NemaFlex-S device is shown in Fig. 3a and consists of two identical sections of 30 chambers, each with pillars. The presence of 2 separate sections allows redundancy in case one section clogs and also reduces pressure drop during animal loading. Each section has a single inlet, a single outlet, and a side vent port to remove air bubbles. The pillar chamber has a diameter of 3 mm to allow the 1 mm long adults to move freely within the pillars arranged as a square lattice (Fig. 3b). The design of the pillar lattice was based on the body diameter of CeMM-grown adults and the optimal body confinement between pillars needed to induce maximum exertable force30. The body diameter of the adult worms grown in CeMM is D ≈45 μm, which is about half the diameter of animals grown on NGM plates with E. coli OP50 diet. Therefore, pillars of diameter 40 μm were designed along with the pillar gap being ≈40 μm so that the body confinement of ≈1 is within the admissible range30. The pillar chamber height was designed to be ≈100 μm and the pillar height to be ≈80 μm, providing a clearance of ≈20 μm between the pillar tip and the chamber floor. To facilitate easy selection of the imaging focal plane by the crew, a focusing pillar of 200 µm in diameter was introduced at the center of the chamber (Fig. 3c). Fig. 3. Design of the NemaFlex-S device for strength measurement of C. elegans.

See Supplementary Video for trapping and loading of an adult into the chamber. Images used in this figure were captured at TTU.To obtain animals of a specific age from the mixed population in FEP bags, we focused on sorting gravid adults since it allows the crew to visually confirm these egg-bearing animals (Fig. 3b). An on-chip strategy for size-based sorting of gravid adults was implemented by adding two key geometric features to the pillar chambers – tapered necks and sieve channels, as shown in Fig. 3c–e. The principle underlying these geometric features is that an animal of a given size is arrested in the tapered neck, while animals below this size are washed out from the sieve channel. The neck was designed to be ≈2.2 mm long with the minimum width being ≈25 μm such that the 1 mm long adult remains trapped in the neck until the flow rate is increased to push the trapped animal inside the chamber. The sieve channels separated by ≈20 μm at the end of the chamber serve the dual purpose of retaining the adult in the chamber but allowing a path for the washout of larvae and eggs43,47. The high-resolution images of the pillars and sieve channels are shown in Fig. 3d and Fig. 3e, respectively. Since the chambers are connected to the flow channel via the tapered neck and sieve channels, they provide a low resistance path for the worm suspension to flow. Gravid adults passing through the flow channel tend to follow the low resistance path and become trapped in the necks (Fig. 3f). Once most of the necks are occupied, the adults can be pushed into the chambers by setting the pump to higher flow rates (See Supplementary Movie 1), as discussed later in the paper. Design of the worm-loading apparatus The worm suspension in FEP bags and the NemaFlex-S device need to be integrated in a facile manner to allow the crew to load worms in the pillared chambers. This bag-to-chip integration was achieved using a worm loading apparatus (WLA) to prevent open handling of culture that presents a biohazard on ISS. The design of the WLA addressed several requirements for the crew to conduct the experiment in an efficient and safe manner. These requirements include (i) containment of the glass-bonded microfluidic device in case of potential glass breakage, (ii) storage and dispensing of samples including waste in closed containers to avoid fluids that might float in microgravity and contaminate the ISS environment, and (iii) a flow distribution system that allowed switching of different fluids that need to be injected into the NemaFlex-S device during the loading protocol. Although such requirements are not critical for conducting microfluidic experiments on Earth, they become crucial due to crew safety and time being a priority on ISS. The schematic of the WLA shown in Fig. 4a was designed for leak-proof and efficient loading of the worms into the NemaFlex-S device. WLA has four key hardware components: (i) an imaging cassette, (ii) a flow distribution valve, (iii) a programmable syringe pump, and (iv) a specially designed board to mount hardware components and fluid lines (Fig. 4b, c). The worm suspension loop shown in Fig. 4a goes underneath the distribution valve (see Fig. 4b, c). The imaging cassette schematic shown in Fig. 4d housed the glass-bonded microfluidic device. It was machined from polysulfone–a high-performance plastic. The retention clips serve to hold the Nemaflex-S device and the inlet/outlet cannulas. The fasteners on either side are aligned with the side vent ports to purge air and then plug the vent holes. Two waste reservoirs collect the outgoing liquid (up to 3 mL each side) from the NemaFlex-S device during the worm loading process and are vented by porous membranes. The lids to the waste chambers are designed to be adhesively attached. The inlet cannulas are connected to the distribution valve with the help of tubing, and outlet cannulas are connected to the waste reservoirs. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replica of the NemaFlex-S device of 4.25 ± 0.25 mm thickness can be integrated into the cassette. The imaging cassette was mounted on the board using Velcro®. The cassette can be removed after loading the worms into the NemaFlex-S device and mounted on the microscopic stage for the crew to perform imaging. The actual image of the WLA is shown in Fig. 4e.

Open in a new tab a Schematic diagram of the worm loading apparatus (b) and (c) shows the schematic top and bottom view of the WLA board and its key component, respectively. d A leak proof imaging cassette for loading the worms into NemaFlex-S Cassette. The highlighted parts are: (1) inlet lines connected to the distribution valve (2) clips holding the inlet and outlet cannulas (3) L-shaped cannulas connected to the inlet of NemaFlex-S chip (4) cannula connected to air-vent purge port (5) outlet cannula opening into the waste collection chamber (6) porous membrane for releasing the air. e Image of the actual worm loading apparatus showing the three major hardware components – Imaging cassette, distribution valve, and the syringe pump. The worm culture bag and 10 mL waste collection syringe are connected to the distribution valve; the worm suspension loop carries either the CeMM from the media syringe or worm solution from the culture bag. The distribution valve has a feeding port (shown in fig. c) underneath the mounting board. Image used in this figure was captured at TTU.Another crucial component of the WLA apparatus is the 4-way distribution valve. The feed to the distribution valve comes from the CeMM syringe mounted on the syringe pump (see Fig. 4a, e) via an inlet port present underneath the mounting board (see Fig. 4b, c). The length of tubing from the media syringe is predetermined to create a fluid loop that can hold a defined volume of worm suspension aspirated from the FEP culture bag. Two ports of the valve are connected to the two inlets of the imaging cassette. The remaining two ports are connected to the worm culture bag and the waste collection syringe, respectively. The direction of fluid flow can be manually controlled by turning the knob on the distribution valve. A script was programmed into the syringe pump, allowing the astronauts to click on the pump program and follow the instructions to load the animals into the NemaFlex-S device. Optimized procedures for spaceflight experiment Given that spaceflight experiments are costly endeavors, there is a need to robustly test protocols to be used by the crew and address potential experiment risks. With the completion of the WLA design and fabrication, we developed and tested a crew protocol to load animals into the NemaFlex-S device and achieve optimal animal occupancy in the pillared chambers. Instead of shipping the NemaFlex-S devices dry for spaceflight experiment, and priming them on ISS, which might lead to bubble formation as the liquid permeates the pillared chambers, we chose to prime the devices with deionized (DI) water on Earth and address any potential bubble issues prior to flight by conducting long-term device storage experiments. Below, we discuss our optimization efforts to develop a crew-friendly and time-efficient protocol for loading animals and our risk-mitigation strategy to have NemaFlex-S devices remain bubble-free. The objective of the worm loading protocol involved replacing the DI water present in the pre-filled NemaFlex-S devices with CeMM, drawing a defined volume of worm suspension to inject into the chambers, and then pumping CeMM through the devices to remove progeny in the chambers. This objective was accomplished in multiple steps as shown schematically in Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 2. Figure 5a shows the schematic of the WLA, with the worm suspension loop present underneath the distribution valve (see Fig. 4c). Since all the lines in the WLA board are primed with DI water during storage, therefore we need to prime the line and distribution valve with CeMM to remove DI water and any possible air pockets developed during the storage process. Therefore, in step I, 1 mL of CeMM was purged towards the waste collection syringe at 1000 mL/h as shown in Fig. 5b. Fig. 5. Schematic diagram of protocol of loading worms into NemaFlex-S device using the Worm Loading Apparatus. Open in a new tab a Shows the schematic of the worm loading apparatus. (b) Step I: priming of the valve with CeMM, flow will be from CeMM media syringe to waste collection syringe. (c) Step II: aspirating a specified worm aliquot from worm culture bag to worm suspension loop. d Step III: priming of the valve with worm suspension, flow is from suspension loop to waste collection syringe. (e) Step IV: taking a specified worm aliquot (400 µL) from worm bag to suspension loop. (f) Step V: load the worms into A side of the NemaFlex-S device. Repeat step IV and step V to load the worms into the B side of the NemaFlex-S device.The next step involved priming with worm suspension because the distribution valve and ports have a dead volume that is filled with DI water during storage. Prior to performing this step, the culture bag was thoroughly mixed using a 3 mL syringe to ensure uniform distribution of animals. This process also removes any air trapped in the neck of the bag. Subsequently, the culture bag was manually spun to ensure bubbles collect at the far end of the bag. Immediately after this step, a clamp was used to prevent the air in the headspace reaching the valve port. Finally, the bag was connected to the worm loading port, and 400 µL of worm suspension was withdrawn from the worm culture bag (Fig. 5c) and subsequently transferred into the waste collection syringe at 400 mL/h (Fig. 5d). Subsequent steps involve loading animals in the NemaFlex-S device with the two sides (NF-A and NF-B) being loaded sequentially. For this step as well, the culture bag was mixed and 400 µL of worm suspension was withdrawn at 400 mL/h (Fig. 5e). Then the valve was turned towards NF-A to replace the DI water in the microfluidic device with CeMM at 25 mL/h. Next, the 400 µL of worm suspension was aspirated to trap animals at the neck, followed by 1500 µL of CeMM at 25 mL/h to wash out the progeny (Fig. 5f). Overall, this procedure took ≈17 min to complete per imaging cassette (see Supplementary Table 2). Next, we tested the efficacy of the crew-assisted loading protocol described above by keeping the animal density in the culture bags at 1000 adults/mL and maintaining the maximum push flow rate of animals into the chamber at 25 mL/h. We optimized the protocol by varying the flow rates for trapping the animals in the tapered necks since trapping is the rate-limiting step in the worm loading protocol. Additionally, we optimized the worm suspension volume aspirated from the culture bag, as the number of animals in the aspirated volume will determine the frequency of trapping and occupancy rate in the chambers. Our objective was to identify conditions that resulted in most chambers being occupied with 1 to 2 gravid adults to allow convenient software processing of pillar deflections. As shown in Fig. 6a, two different flow rates of 5 mL/h and 7 mL/h were used for trapping the worms in the tapered neck. The aspirated worm suspension volume was kept constant at 300 µL. We found that the number of chambers occupied by 1 to 2 gravid adults were relatively higher for 7 mL/h flow rate (29 ± 3 chambers) compared with 5 mL/h flow rate (25 ± 1 chambers). In addition, trapping at 7 mL/h reduces the total time of loading. Next, we optimized the worm suspension volume while keeping all other parameters constant. Three different volumes (300 µL, 400 µL, and 500 µL) of worm suspension were used to load the NemaFlex-S device. The total number of chambers occupied by gravid adults when using suspension volumes of 300 µL, 400 µL, and 500 µL were 31 ± 3, 36 ± 2, and 41 ± 3, respectively. Although the total number of chambers occupied with gravid adults was highest for 500 µL, it had only 29 ± 1 chambers occupied with 1-2 animals compared with 31 ± 3 chambers for 400 µL (Fig. 6b). Therefore, 400 µL of worm aliquot was used in the crew protocol for loading animals in the NemaFlex-S device. Fig. 6. Optimization of parameters used for efficient loading of worms into NemaFlex-S device. Open in a new tab a Effect of flow rate used for worm trapping in the tapered neck (Supplementary Table 3). b Effect of worm suspension volume (Supplementary Table 4). The density of animals in the culture bag was 1060 ± 160 adults/mL. Error bars represent standard deviation. Long-term storage of NemaFlex-S device in WLA Our need to conduct an 8-week long experiment with PDMS-based microfluidic devices raised two important concerns. First, since we primed the NemaFlex-S devices with DI water, there could be water loss due to PDMS being a porous substrate causing bubble formation. Second, the dissolved gases in the liquid might cause bubble formation in PDMS devices due to changes in local pressure or temperature or wettability, or geometrical conditions. Both these factors may cause bubble formation and make the NemaFlex-S devices unsuitable for clean images needed for optimal strength measurements. Therefore, there was a need to develop a mitigation strategy to address these potential risks. In general, the PDMS layer is porous and hydrophobic in nature. The PDMS devices can be turned into hydrophilic by oxidized plasma bonding and it is reported that the hydrophilic nature of the device can be maintained for a longer duration of time if the device is submerged in water48–50. Placing the entire WLA board in water is practically impossible due to space/payload constraints. Therefore, we adopted an alternative approach to mitigate water loss and maintain the hydrophilic nature of devices by creating a humidified environment around the PDMS surfaces. We not only maintained the humid environment around the microfluidic chip, rather we keep the wet towel directly on top of the PDMS microfluidic device. Placing a wet towel directly on top of the PDMS layer is equivalent to submerging the device in water. A blue surgical towel was attached on top of the PDMS layer and soaked with 5 mL of DI water. Another piece of the towel was attached to the bottom side of the WLA platform and again soaked with 7.5 mL of DI water. Once these moist towels were attached, the entire WLA was kept inside a Bitran™ bag. The excess bag was folded over the WLA and then put into a secondary Bitran bag. Humidity sensors were placed inside the primary bag, and a 9-week storage experiment was conducted. We observed less than 1% loss in humidity during the test period indicating that our approach to preventing moisture loss and minimizing bubbles within NemaFlex-S devices was successful. This technique helps in maintaining the hydrophilicity of the microfluidic device and prevents the formation/nucleation of air bubbles in the NemaFlex-S devices. Ground testing of microfluidics-integrated hardware Upon integration of the WLA with the NemaFlex-S device and optimization of the worm loading protocol, we piloted a ground study to measure the muscle strength of wild-type C. elegans using the multi-generational culture protocol. The objective of the ground testing was to demonstrate the capability to implement the multi-generational culture, loading protocol, imaging session, and analysis of the videos. This allowed us to assess risks associated with maintaining sterile culture over the 8 weeks of experiment, achieving efficacious worm loading from a mixed population, and observing consistency in strength measurement of gravid adults given that all gravid animals may not be of the same age. Figure 7 shows the results of this ground study. The worm diameter at mid-length was also measured to assess the homogeneity of gravid adults occupied in the chambers, which were visually selected for strength analysis based on the presence of eggs. As shown in Fig. 7a, the gravid adult body diameter did not show a statistical difference between animal groups that were assessed during each time point during the experiment, suggesting that the protocols for culture and loading providing a sufficient number of animals suitable for strength evaluation.

Open in a new tab a Worm diameter over multiple generations. b Muscle strength over multiple generations. n = 32 for week 2, n = 36 for week 4, n = 38 for week 6, and n = 41 for week 8 (Supplementary Table 5). Error bars represent standard deviation. All the data pass the normality test. There is no significant difference between force values using one-way ANOVA with P = 0.8.Next, we analyzed the 60-s videos acquired for each gravid adult. We identify the pillar with the maximal deflection in each image and generate a cumulative probability distribution with all the maximal deflections. We use the 95th percentile of this maximal force distribution, referred to as f95, as a measure of muscle strength30. Since the worm body diameters at different time points were not significantly different from each other during this 8-week experiment, its effect on strength measurements was considered negligible. As expected, we did not find any statistical difference in the strength values for wild type on weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 (Fig. 7b). Flight launch and on-orbit operation In summary, this pilot study demonstrated that the experimental procedures developed for the microfluidics-integrated spaceflight hardware make the technology amenable to C. elegans muscle strength investigations on the ISS. Primary culture bags were prepared at Texas Tech University (TTU) with optimized worm densities (1000 Larve/mL) and shipped to Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), Norfolk in a temperature control box. The culture bags were inspected for any possible contamination by the TTU team at EVMS upon arrival and incubated at 20oC until flight turnover. The NemaFlex-S chips were assembled on the WLA board at EVMS by the payload developer (BioServe Space Technology). Given the success of the pilot study, the microfluidics-integrated hardware and culture bags were flown to the ISS on Feb 20th, 2021, as part of the Northrop Grumman Cygnus NG-15 cargo mission. The same number of WLA boards and culture bags were prepared for ground control and shipped to TTU by mimicking the approximately same temperature profile used in the launch. The culture bags were incubated at 20 °C in SABL, and the CeMM bags were stored at 4 °C after receiving them at the ISS. The worms were cultured for a week in microgravity conditions before conducting timepoint-1 activities. Astronauts Shannon Walker, Kathleen Rubins, and Michael Hopkins conducted the On-Orbit operation, with guidance provided to them by the authors of this study. The crew successfully inoculated the culture bags for subsequent time points by employing the culture protocol discussed in Sec. 2A. The worms were loaded into the NemaFlex-S chip, and the movement of worms in the NemaFlex-S chambers was recorded successfully. The experiment went well for 2 generations (time points 1 and 2), and sufficient movies were recorded for muscle strength analysis. We saw a drastic decline in the animal density for time point 3 and 4 in worms cultured at ISS, whereas ground control cultures grew as expected. The reasons for the decline are unknown to us. Preliminary investigations suggest that it could be due to radiation, contamination, or maybe a combination of both, which is yet to be ascertained. We also froze worm cultures after NemaFlex experiments to conduct gene expression studies, enabling us in the future to correlate muscle strength changes to alterations in gene expression. No drying or glass cracks were observed in the NemaFlex-S device over long-time storage. Additionally, no leakage was observed while transferring the cultures from one bag to another and while loading them into the NemaFlex-S device. Thus, the microfluidics-integrated spaceflight hardware for muscle strength investigations in C. elegans has been successfully launched and operated onboard at the ISS. Hundreds of videos were collected along with frozen culture samples for gene expression analysis – this data is being currently analyzed and the results will be reported in the future.",
    "discussion": "Discussion With the human ambition of becoming multi-planetary species, there is a need to understand how the conditions of space (microgravity and radiation) affect the biology and physiology of species grown for multiple generations. Model organisms continue to play an important role in space biology investigations51. Conducting multi-generational studies in mammals on the ISS is a daunting task, however, the C. elegans model presents a unique opportunity for such investigations. Compared to vertebrates, the C. elegans model has significant advantages including a fast generation cycle, small form factor, low payload mass, and translational relevance due to conserved molecular mechanisms. Despite these advantages, conducting successful experiments on the ISS is a major technological feat since it requires the design and integration of crew-interfacing user-friendly, and safe flight hardware and operational protocols. The focus of our study is not only the design of the NemaFlex-S device, but its integration into the Worm Loading Apparatus (WLA) that the crew can use to conduct experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). Below, we discuss the challenges of conducting multigenerational studies and the impact that our microfluidics-integrated space-flight hardware can have on space-biology investigations in C. elegans. The major challenge for conducting multigenerational studies even in C. elegans is to identify suitable culture methods to breed them across generations while maintaining age-matched populations. The standard approach of culturing C. elegans for multiple generations on NGM plates that is typically done on Earth studies, is not suitable since (i) manual picking and transfer of animals to new plates to maintain synchronized populations is laborious and moreover, the open nature of the transfers represents a significant biohazard for ISS investigations. (ii) An additional constraint is the maintenance of defined bacterial population densities across the 8-week duration of our spaceflight experiment may present challenges since high bacterial density might limit oxygen availability for nematodes. To overcome these issues, we have cultured C. elegans inside FEP bags using chemical-defined liquid C. elegans maintenance media, which is being tested and used in the previous space mission’s38,52. The power of the C. elegans model is the availability of a large number of muscle mutants that can potentially serve as biological controls. However, most of these mutants were obtained by standard culture on NGM plates and bacterial diet, and their viability in CeMM across multiple generations remains an open question. Identifying mutants grown in CeMM is challenging as they not only need to be viable, but also their growth rates need to match wild-type animals so that optimized density is available to load into the NemaFlex-S device. In the future, more studies need to be conducted to identify muscle mutants that grow well in CeMM across multiple generations. In our study, since we have wild-type animals growing on Earth, they serve as a biological control to compare against space-bred worms. Therefore, any changes in muscle strength could be compared with respect to ground control. As summarized in Table 1, most flight studies conducted with C. elegans are confined to molecular analysis due to a lack of tools that can quantitate animal behavior, locomotion, and other physiological measures under the constraints imposed by spaceflight and crew time13,14,17,19,25,53,54. Development of new crew-compatible hardware is a major challenge since it requires close collaboration between scientists, payload developers, and space agencies; along with considerations of cost, upload mass, and foot-print requirements. Thus, most science-based investigations are limited by what hardware is available on the ISS. Microfluidic devices present a unique opportunity to capture in vivo physiology data for small animals like C. elegans on the ISS55,56. However, there has been a lack of microfluidics integrated flight-ready hardware that is compatible with crew requirements and can report on muscle physiology. In the present study, we validated microfluidic integrated hardware on Earth and successfully launched it to the ISS. The library of videos acquired from the spaceflight study along with the gene expression data from multiple generations of animals will be a valuable resource to the scientific community that has been enabled by our integrated technology. The advancements offered by this hardware are as follows: (i) The microfluidic device is suitable for sorting the gravid adult animals of a specific size from a mixed culture and allowing the removal of progenies. (ii) The microfluidic device is integrated with a leak-proof cassette that can retain the waste generated during the loading of the worms, and therefore prevent contamination of the workstation. (iii) The worm loading apparatus helps in loading the animals in the microfluidic device with minimal effort from the crew. Astronauts need to simply click on the pump program and change the knob position on the distribution valve. (iv) Convenient recording of low or high-resolution videos of the animal inside the chambers allowing access to whole-organism phenotypic data. As mentioned earlier, previous space missions were mostly limited to molecular analysis due to the lack of proper hardware. The integrated microfluidic hardware developed here is easy to use and opens new avenues for conducting behavioral and stress assays onboard ISS since the C. elegans model is widely accepted by the space biology community to understand the effects of short and long-term space missions. The hardware can be used for assessing the effect of environmental toxins, drugs, gut microbes, in-flight radiation, etc. The videos can be recorded based on the need of the study design and can be used to detect the changes in the behavior of the animal since behavioral alterations are an earlier indicator of toxic exposure than the death of the organism57. The current hardware can also be used to study aging since the physiological and pathological changes occurring in space-flight conditions are reminiscent of accelerated aging. Indeed, how the spaceflight environment affects animal lifespan and healthspan is not well understood. Attempts have been made in the past to understand aging in C. elegans in space14,58. However, these studies do not preserve the identity of the worms and use biomarkers to inform on aging, rather than actual lifespan or healthspan measurements. The current hardware provides the basic solution to both problems as synchronized animals can be housed individually in the chambers and image-based phenotypic data can be obtained. Implementing some degree of automation to the current hardware could enable facile aging investigations on the ISS while reducing crew time. The present study sets the stage for future space biology investigations on the ISS. Given that the C. elegans model is used in a variety of fundamental biology investigations ranging from behavior to neurobiology to aging, we anticipate that the NemaFlex-S devices used in this study will aid in such investigations. Additionally, our documented protocols for animal culture, animal loading, and the flow control system could be adapted to instrument a variety of C. elegans-based microfluidic devices already reported in the literature for spaceflight studies43–46,59. Successful completion of experiments with our technology over multigeneration in a microgravity environment opens the door for future discoveries using C. elegans as a model organism.

Copyright notice ID: 9640571 PMID: 36344513 Abstract Caenorhabditis elegans is a low-cost genetic model that has been flown to the International Space Station to investigate the influence of microgravity on changes in the expression of genes involved in muscle maintenance. These studies showed that genes that encode muscle attachment complexes have decreased expression under microgravity. However, it remains to be answered whether the decreased expression leads to concomitant changes in animal muscle strength, specifically across multiple generations. We recently reported the NemaFlex microfluidic device for the measurement of muscle strength of C. elegans (Rahman et al., Lab Chip, 2018). In this study, we redesign our original NemaFlex device and integrate it with flow control hardware for spaceflight investigations considering mixed animal culture, constraints on astronaut time, crew safety, and on-orbit operations. The technical advances we have made include (i) a microfluidic device design that allows animals of a given size to be sorted from unsynchronized cultures and housed in individual chambers, (ii) a fluid handling protocol for injecting the suspension of animals into the microfluidic device that prevents channel clogging, introduction of bubbles, and crowding of animals in the chambers, and (iii) a custom-built worm-loading apparatus interfaced with the microfluidic device that allows easy manipulation of the worm suspension and prevents fluid leakage into the surrounding environment. Collectively, these technical advances enabled the development of new microfluidics-integrated hardware for spaceflight studies in C. elegans. Finally, we report Earth-based validation studies to test this new hardware, which has led to it being flown to the International Space Station. Subject terms: Human behaviour, Biological techniquesIntroduction Among the many pathophysiological changes that occur during human spaceflight, muscle atrophy is significant and remains a major impediment to deep space exploration1,2. The postural muscles are most affected in the microgravity environment, therefore, impacting the activities of astronauts in long-duration spaceflight missions. Even a weeklong stay at the International Space Station (ISS) can lead to degradation in muscle mass and peak power; this loss could be fatal in off-nominal landing scenarios where assistance might be unavailable. Loss of muscle strength can pose an even more serious problem for interplanetary travel, such as with a venture to Mars, which could take 200 to 300 days. Generally, reduced workload in a microgravity environment is considered to be a primary cause of muscle loss in response to spaceflight3–5. However, altered metabolism also plays a significant role6,7. For example, atrophy in flight is not limited to antigravity muscles but also occurs in vascular smooth muscles and cardiac muscles8–10. To combat muscular atrophy, astronauts exercise (aerobic and resistance) for up to 2.5 h each day. Even with these current countermeasures, the loss in muscle mass is up to 20% during a 5-day to 2-week-long flight, whereas for a long-duration space mission (3 to 6 months), a loss of 30% is noted3,11. In most cases, muscle mass and strength can be regained within a few months to years after returning to Earth by a combination of adapted exercise and rehabilitation11,12. Nevertheless, muscle maintenance in space is still a major concern, and no effective preventive measures exist beyond the limited benefit obtained through exercise. Thus, it is important to determine the mechanisms responsible for the loss of muscle strength in spaceflight and develop appropriate countermeasures. In previous studies, it was shown that alteration in gene expression (e.g., in genes encoding myosin heavy chain kinase and other cytoskeletal proteins) in response to microgravity is similar in cultured embryonic muscle cells1, animals (both vertebrate and invertebrate), and humans10,13. These similarities provide strong motivation for investigating the effect of spaceflight conditions on muscles using invertebrate animal models, thus avoiding the cost and time expense associated with experiments using vertebrates. Indeed, the invertebrate model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), has been recognized as an excellent model system for space biology research and has been flown in several spaceflight investigations14–19. The C. elegans model presents several advantages for spaceflight studies. Up to 40% of its genes are homologous to human genes20,21, and a large library of genetic mutants22 and strains with fluorescent reporters are available. The body wall muscles of C. elegans are functionally analogous to vertebrate muscle, as they include dense bodies and M-lines, the former being functionally equivalent to vertebrate Z-lines. In addition, the nematode is small (≈1 mm), weight is miniscule (≈1 μg), has a short lifespan (≈20 days), fast generation time (∼1 week), and is easy to grow. For spaceflight missions where payload size and weight are critical considerations, C. elegans experimental payloads offer a small form factor and a significant reduction in weight compared with vertebrates. Moreover, the fast reproductive cycle enables multi-generational studies to be conducted, providing an opportunity to explore physiological adaptations due to long-term habitation in space. These advantages and existing strain resources make C. elegans a leading invertebrate animal model for spaceflight studies. On Earth, adult C. elegans cultured in liquid media tend to sediment, indicating that animals experience gravitational stresses23,24. In microgravity, gravitational effects are significantly weaker, which alters C. elegans physiology13. In prior spaceflight experiments with C. elegans, it was found that approximately 150 muscle genes were downregulated in C. elegans during 10 days of culture in microgravity13,25. Among the detected downregulated muscle genes were key motor protein genes such as MyoD and myosin heavy chain, and two genes (unc-97 and unc-112) that encode members of a muscle attachment complex13. Members of the attachment complex (called the costamere in humans) have been shown in humans to increase expression and activity with increased mechanical load and decrease expression and activity in response to immobilization. Thus, muscle attachment genes play an important role in processes leading to muscle loss. In C. elegans on Earth, decreased expression of these genes via acute RNAi treatments results in movement defects and various subcellular defects within the muscle (e.g., disorganization and collapse of arrayed sarcomeres)26. A key open question is if and how the changes in muscle gene expression observed in spaceflight result in decreased muscle strength. While decreased force production is documented for astronauts, it is yet to be demonstrated for C. elegans cultured in microgravity. Several studies have used elastomeric micropillars to measure muscle forces in C. elegans27–29, and we have recently standardized a microfluidic device and approach for obtaining the maximum exertable force, providing a measure of nematode muscle strength. This strength measurement apparatus is called NemaFlex30,31 and consists of a microfluidic chamber with microfabricated deformable pillars. The force produced by a nematode moving between the pillars is evaluated from the pillar deflections observed under a microscope. The NemaFlex device and the force measurement protocol have been optimized such that muscle strength is independent of behavior and gait. The device is also capable of detecting strength differences in mutants with defects in muscle genes31,32. The NemaFlex device is miniaturized and simple to use, and thus has potential for C. elegans spaceflight experiments. In this study, we address technical challenges for conducting multi-generational C. elegans strength measurements in microgravity. These technical challenges include culturing of animals across several generations, obtaining nearly age-synchronized animals of a given size for strength measurements, establishment of an imaging protocol for recording pillar deflections, and development of an on-orbit protocol for experimentation that minimizes crew time and ensures astronaut safety on the ISS. Addressing these technical challenges, we report a reconfigured spaceflight ready NemaFlex device (referred to as NemaFlex-S), new protocols for experimentation with C. elegans, and a custom-designed hardware for on-orbit operation of NemaFlex-S on the ISS. This integrated technology and protocols enabled its successful operation by astronauts on the ISS producing significant visual data of C. elegans across multiple generations.Results C. elegans culture for multigenerational spaceflight studies The goal of our spaceflight experiment on ISS is to measure the strength of adult wild-type C. elegans at 4-time points across an 8-week period corresponding to 8 generations. This study design allows the evaluation of potential changes in muscle strength due to short and long-term muscle adaptation to the microgravity environment. In contrast to conducting experiments on Earth, spaceflight experiments present unique constraints that deserve special consideration. These constraints include crew time for conducting the experiments, maintaining sterile culture conditions, and the safety of the crew members and workstation at ISS. Therefore, while developing culturing and fluid handling protocols, the microfluidic device, and the worm loading apparatus, we considered these spaceflight constraints. The first challenge was to culture C. elegans for several generations on ISS. Table 1 lists the different space-flight missions with C. elegans, the culturing hardware, and the food source used in these studies. In typical laboratory conditions on Earth, C. elegans is cultured on nematode growth media (NGM) plates. Culturing C. elegans on NGM plates is generally labor-intensive as it requires manual picking of animals and transfers to new plates to maintain synchronized animal populations. Such laborious tasks consume significant crew time; therefore, the culture of C. elegans on NGM plates remains impractical for multigenerational studies in space. Table 1.

Although non-pathogenic E. coli OP50 is typically used as the food source, maintenance of defined bacterial population densities across the 8-week duration of our spaceflight experiment may present challenges since high bacterial density might limit oxygen availability for nematodes. C. elegans on NGM plates are used mostly in simulated microgravity on Earth33–35. C. elegans were flown to space on a standard agar-based nematode growth medium for a short duration of 10 to 20 days with different space missions36–39 as listed in Table 1. But the missions do not involve imaging onboard, therefore all the behavioral studies were conducted postflight. To overcome the issues discussed above, the wild-type worms were cultured in chemically defined liquid C. elegans maintenance media (CeMM)40. The safety and low-maintenance requirements make CeMM robust and appropriate media for multigenerational cultures on board the International Space Station. However, previous experiments show there are some differences between nematodes grown using NGM and CeMM40,41. In particular, C. elegans development is slower, progeny production is slower, and lifespan is increased in C. elegans cultured in CeMM compared with those cultured using NGM41. In addition, the culture vessels used to maintain C. elegans could impact their growth. Therefore, there was a need to optimize culture protocols in CeMM and in spaceflight compatible culture vessels to achieve consistent culture densities across multiple generations. The worms were maintained in CeMM in biocompatible Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) bags (Fig. 1a). These bags provide a solution for culturing C. elegans in liquid media since they are highly permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide while remaining impermeable to water42. An efficient and robust protocol was developed for culturing the animals to maintain the desired density across several generations to prevent overcrowding and ensure nutrient availability. A schematic of the culturing protocol for multigenerational studies in C. elegans is depicted in Fig. 1b. Primary bags (group 1) with approximately 1000 larvae/mL were prepared at day 0 and incubated at 20 ± 1 °C for 2 weeks. On week 2, a specified aliquot (1 mL) of the media with worms was transferred from this bag to a new bag that was prefilled with 19 mL of fresh CeMM. The new bag was incubated at 20 ± 1 °C, and the old bag was used for loading the worms into the NemaFlex-S device. The same culturing protocol was followed every other week for the remaining generations. No transfer was made on week 8. Fig. 1. C. elegans culture in CeMM and the multigenerational culture protocol.

Here, d0 represents day 0 (start of the culture), and w2, w4, w6, and w8 represent week 2, week 4, week 6, and week 8, respectively.The efficacy of the multigenerational culturing protocol discussed in Fig. 1b was evaluated by measuring animal density and locomotory health during the 8-week multigeneration experiment. Since the culture was not age-synchronized, we measured the density of adults, larvae, eggs, and dead animals in the FEP bags. In parallel, we also measured the thrashing frequency of gravid adults as a health measure. Both these measurements were conducted on weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the culture consisted of more than 1000 adults/mL, the approximate density needed for optimized loading into the NemaFlex-S device. The culture was also found to have several thousands of larvae and eggs, which shows good reproductive health and overall health of the animals in the culture. With regards to locomotory health, we find that the thrashing frequency is the same across all four-time points (Fig. 2b). Thus, the overall culture health is not compromised over the 8-week multigenerational experiment. Fig. 2.

There is no significant difference between thrashing frequency as calculated by one-way ANOVA, P ≥ 0.7.Design of the NemaFlex-S microfluidic device Our concept for designing a spaceflight ready microfluidic device involved ideally housing individual animals in small chambers so that the astronaut performing the imaging can easily locate and record videos of animals, thereby reducing crew time. In recent years efforts have been made in studying the behavior of C. elegans in longitudinal chips43–46, worms were loaded automatically into these chips. Prior literature provides design guidance on how to house individual C. elegans in microfluidic chambers, however, these devices do not meet the needs of multigenerational space-flight studies. For example, Chung et al.43 and Le et al.44 designed a microfluidic device that had an array of connected chambers with tapered necks for individual animals to enter and be housed. Although these devices can successfully house individual animals, they were optimized for age-synchronized animals and not for mixed populations where progeny needs to be removed. Moreover, the chambers were not configured with flexible pillars, which makes them unsuitable for strength measurements. Additionally, in these Earth-based studies, worms were cultured on plates and then transferred to liquid media. Transferring the liquid culture in a microfluidic device in an open manner is not safe as it can lead to contamination of the workstation at ISS and possibly cause health hazards due to the presence of bacterial food. Building on this prior work, we considered additional criteria relevant to our spaceflight experiment that led to technical advances in engineering the NemaFlex-S device. These additional criteria include: (i) given that the culturing protocol generates a mixed population of animals, the device design should be capable of sorting and obtaining nearly age- and size-matched animals since muscle strength of C. elegans can vary with developmental stage and body size30, (ii) the pillar diameter and spacing should be modified to accommodate CeMM-grown animals, which are skinnier than bacteria-fed worms for whom the original NemaFlex deflectable pillar geometry was optimized, (iii) maximize the number of chambers with 1 to 2 animals so that the image-processing code can detect pillar deformations and cleanly associate it with the corresponding animal making those deflections, (iv) minimize entry of air bubbles or plugs into the pillar arena that can negatively impact animal loading and image processing, which ultimately can reduce collection of useful animal data from the space experiment, (v) allow a means for the crew on orbit to easily focus the microscope objective on the pillar rim which is crucial for the software to auto-detect the deflections, and (vi) establish a relatively simple chip-to-world interface so that the crew time is reduced for loading the animals into the individual pillar chambers. The layout of the NemaFlex-S device is shown in Fig. 3a and consists of two identical sections of 30 chambers, each with pillars. The presence of 2 separate sections allows redundancy in case one section clogs and also reduces pressure drop during animal loading. Each section has a single inlet, a single outlet, and a side vent port to remove air bubbles. The pillar chamber has a diameter of 3 mm to allow the 1 mm long adults to move freely within the pillars arranged as a square lattice (Fig. 3b). The design of the pillar lattice was based on the body diameter of CeMM-grown adults and the optimal body confinement between pillars needed to induce maximum exertable force30. The body diameter of the adult worms grown in CeMM is D ≈45 μm, which is about half the diameter of animals grown on NGM plates with E. coli OP50 diet. Therefore, pillars of diameter 40 μm were designed along with the pillar gap being ≈40 μm so that the body confinement of ≈1 is within the admissible range30. The pillar chamber height was designed to be ≈100 μm and the pillar height to be ≈80 μm, providing a clearance of ≈20 μm between the pillar tip and the chamber floor. To facilitate easy selection of the imaging focal plane by the crew, a focusing pillar of 200 µm in diameter was introduced at the center of the chamber (Fig. 3c). Fig. 3.

See Supplementary Video for trapping and loading of an adult into the chamber. Images used in this figure were captured at TTU.To obtain animals of a specific age from the mixed population in FEP bags, we focused on sorting gravid adults since it allows the crew to visually confirm these egg-bearing animals (Fig. 3b). An on-chip strategy for size-based sorting of gravid adults was implemented by adding two key geometric features to the pillar chambers – tapered necks and sieve channels, as shown in Fig. 3c–e. The principle underlying these geometric features is that an animal of a given size is arrested in the tapered neck, while animals below this size are washed out from the sieve channel. The neck was designed to be ≈2.2 mm long with the minimum width being ≈25 μm such that the 1 mm long adult remains trapped in the neck until the flow rate is increased to push the trapped animal inside the chamber. The sieve channels separated by ≈20 μm at the end of the chamber serve the dual purpose of retaining the adult in the chamber but allowing a path for the washout of larvae and eggs43,47. The high-resolution images of the pillars and sieve channels are shown in Fig. 3d and Fig. 3e, respectively. Since the chambers are connected to the flow channel via the tapered neck and sieve channels, they provide a low resistance path for the worm suspension to flow. Gravid adults passing through the flow channel tend to follow the low resistance path and become trapped in the necks (Fig. 3f). Once most of the necks are occupied, the adults can be pushed into the chambers by setting the pump to higher flow rates (See Supplementary Movie 1), as discussed later in the paper.Design of the worm-loading apparatus The worm suspension in FEP bags and the NemaFlex-S device need to be integrated in a facile manner to allow the crew to load worms in the pillared chambers. This bag-to-chip integration was achieved using a worm loading apparatus (WLA) to prevent open handling of culture that presents a biohazard on ISS. The design of the WLA addressed several requirements for the crew to conduct the experiment in an efficient and safe manner. These requirements include (i) containment of the glass-bonded microfluidic device in case of potential glass breakage, (ii) storage and dispensing of samples including waste in closed containers to avoid fluids that might float in microgravity and contaminate the ISS environment, and (iii) a flow distribution system that allowed switching of different fluids that need to be injected into the NemaFlex-S device during the loading protocol. Although such requirements are not critical for conducting microfluidic experiments on Earth, they become crucial due to crew safety and time being a priority on ISS. The schematic of the WLA shown in Fig. 4a was designed for leak-proof and efficient loading of the worms into the NemaFlex-S device. WLA has four key hardware components: (i) an imaging cassette, (ii) a flow distribution valve, (iii) a programmable syringe pump, and (iv) a specially designed board to mount hardware components and fluid lines (Fig. 4b, c). The worm suspension loop shown in Fig. 4a goes underneath the distribution valve (see Fig. 4b, c). The imaging cassette schematic shown in Fig. 4d housed the glass-bonded microfluidic device. It was machined from polysulfone–a high-performance plastic. The retention clips serve to hold the Nemaflex-S device and the inlet/outlet cannulas. The fasteners on either side are aligned with the side vent ports to purge air and then plug the vent holes. Two waste reservoirs collect the outgoing liquid (up to 3 mL each side) from the NemaFlex-S device during the worm loading process and are vented by porous membranes. The lids to the waste chambers are designed to be adhesively attached. The inlet cannulas are connected to the distribution valve with the help of tubing, and outlet cannulas are connected to the waste reservoirs. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replica of the NemaFlex-S device of 4.25 ± 0.25 mm thickness can be integrated into the cassette. The imaging cassette was mounted on the board using Velcro®. The cassette can be removed after loading the worms into the NemaFlex-S device and mounted on the microscopic stage for the crew to perform imaging. The actual image of the WLA is shown in Fig. 4e.

The worm culture bag and 10 mL waste collection syringe are connected to the distribution valve; the worm suspension loop carries either the CeMM from the media syringe or worm solution from the culture bag. The distribution valve has a feeding port (shown in fig. c) underneath the mounting board. Image used in this figure was captured at TTU.Another crucial component of the WLA apparatus is the 4-way distribution valve. The feed to the distribution valve comes from the CeMM syringe mounted on the syringe pump (see Fig. 4a, e) via an inlet port present underneath the mounting board (see Fig. 4b, c). The length of tubing from the media syringe is predetermined to create a fluid loop that can hold a defined volume of worm suspension aspirated from the FEP culture bag. Two ports of the valve are connected to the two inlets of the imaging cassette. The remaining two ports are connected to the worm culture bag and the waste collection syringe, respectively. The direction of fluid flow can be manually controlled by turning the knob on the distribution valve. A script was programmed into the syringe pump, allowing the astronauts to click on the pump program and follow the instructions to load the animals into the NemaFlex-S device.Optimized procedures for spaceflight experiment Given that spaceflight experiments are costly endeavors, there is a need to robustly test protocols to be used by the crew and address potential experiment risks. With the completion of the WLA design and fabrication, we developed and tested a crew protocol to load animals into the NemaFlex-S device and achieve optimal animal occupancy in the pillared chambers. Instead of shipping the NemaFlex-S devices dry for spaceflight experiment, and priming them on ISS, which might lead to bubble formation as the liquid permeates the pillared chambers, we chose to prime the devices with deionized (DI) water on Earth and address any potential bubble issues prior to flight by conducting long-term device storage experiments. Below, we discuss our optimization efforts to develop a crew-friendly and time-efficient protocol for loading animals and our risk-mitigation strategy to have NemaFlex-S devices remain bubble-free. The objective of the worm loading protocol involved replacing the DI water present in the pre-filled NemaFlex-S devices with CeMM, drawing a defined volume of worm suspension to inject into the chambers, and then pumping CeMM through the devices to remove progeny in the chambers. This objective was accomplished in multiple steps as shown schematically in Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 2. Figure 5a shows the schematic of the WLA, with the worm suspension loop present underneath the distribution valve (see Fig. 4c). Since all the lines in the WLA board are primed with DI water during storage, therefore we need to prime the line and distribution valve with CeMM to remove DI water and any possible air pockets developed during the storage process. Therefore, in step I, 1 mL of CeMM was purged towards the waste collection syringe at 1000 mL/h as shown in Fig. 5b. Fig. 5. Schematic diagram of protocol of loading worms into NemaFlex-S device using the Worm Loading Apparatus. Open in a new tab a Shows the schematic of the worm loading apparatus. (b) Step I: priming of the valve with CeMM, flow will be from CeMM media syringe to waste collection syringe. (c) Step II: aspirating a specified worm aliquot from worm culture bag to worm suspension loop. d Step III: priming of the valve with worm suspension, flow is from suspension loop to waste collection syringe. (e) Step IV: taking a specified worm aliquot (400 µL) from worm bag to suspension loop. (f) Step V: load the worms into A side of the NemaFlex-S device. Repeat step IV and step V to load the worms into the B side of the NemaFlex-S device.The next step involved priming with worm suspension because the distribution valve and ports have a dead volume that is filled with DI water during storage. Prior to performing this step, the culture bag was thoroughly mixed using a 3 mL syringe to ensure uniform distribution of animals. This process also removes any air trapped in the neck of the bag. Subsequently, the culture bag was manually spun to ensure bubbles collect at the far end of the bag. Immediately after this step, a clamp was used to prevent the air in the headspace reaching the valve port. Finally, the bag was connected to the worm loading port, and 400 µL of worm suspension was withdrawn from the worm culture bag (Fig. 5c) and subsequently transferred into the waste collection syringe at 400 mL/h (Fig. 5d). Subsequent steps involve loading animals in the NemaFlex-S device with the two sides (NF-A and NF-B) being loaded sequentially. For this step as well, the culture bag was mixed and 400 µL of worm suspension was withdrawn at 400 mL/h (Fig. 5e). Then the valve was turned towards NF-A to replace the DI water in the microfluidic device with CeMM at 25 mL/h. Next, the 400 µL of worm suspension was aspirated to trap animals at the neck, followed by 1500 µL of CeMM at 25 mL/h to wash out the progeny (Fig. 5f). Overall, this procedure took ≈17 min to complete per imaging cassette (see Supplementary Table 2). Next, we tested the efficacy of the crew-assisted loading protocol described above by keeping the animal density in the culture bags at 1000 adults/mL and maintaining the maximum push flow rate of animals into the chamber at 25 mL/h. We optimized the protocol by varying the flow rates for trapping the animals in the tapered necks since trapping is the rate-limiting step in the worm loading protocol. Additionally, we optimized the worm suspension volume aspirated from the culture bag, as the number of animals in the aspirated volume will determine the frequency of trapping and occupancy rate in the chambers. Our objective was to identify conditions that resulted in most chambers being occupied with 1 to 2 gravid adults to allow convenient software processing of pillar deflections. As shown in Fig. 6a, two different flow rates of 5 mL/h and 7 mL/h were used for trapping the worms in the tapered neck. The aspirated worm suspension volume was kept constant at 300 µL. We found that the number of chambers occupied by 1 to 2 gravid adults were relatively higher for 7 mL/h flow rate (29 ± 3 chambers) compared with 5 mL/h flow rate (25 ± 1 chambers). In addition, trapping at 7 mL/h reduces the total time of loading. Next, we optimized the worm suspension volume while keeping all other parameters constant. Three different volumes (300 µL, 400 µL, and 500 µL) of worm suspension were used to load the NemaFlex-S device. The total number of chambers occupied by gravid adults when using suspension volumes of 300 µL, 400 µL, and 500 µL were 31 ± 3, 36 ± 2, and 41 ± 3, respectively. Although the total number of chambers occupied with gravid adults was highest for 500 µL, it had only 29 ± 1 chambers occupied with 1-2 animals compared with 31 ± 3 chambers for 400 µL (Fig. 6b). Therefore, 400 µL of worm aliquot was used in the crew protocol for loading animals in the NemaFlex-S device. Fig. 6.

The density of animals in the culture bag was 1060 ± 160 adults/mL. Error bars represent standard deviation.Long-term storage of NemaFlex-S device in WLA Our need to conduct an 8-week long experiment with PDMS-based microfluidic devices raised two important concerns. First, since we primed the NemaFlex-S devices with DI water, there could be water loss due to PDMS being a porous substrate causing bubble formation. Second, the dissolved gases in the liquid might cause bubble formation in PDMS devices due to changes in local pressure or temperature or wettability, or geometrical conditions. Both these factors may cause bubble formation and make the NemaFlex-S devices unsuitable for clean images needed for optimal strength measurements. Therefore, there was a need to develop a mitigation strategy to address these potential risks. In general, the PDMS layer is porous and hydrophobic in nature. The PDMS devices can be turned into hydrophilic by oxidized plasma bonding and it is reported that the hydrophilic nature of the device can be maintained for a longer duration of time if the device is submerged in water48–50. Placing the entire WLA board in water is practically impossible due to space/payload constraints. Therefore, we adopted an alternative approach to mitigate water loss and maintain the hydrophilic nature of devices by creating a humidified environment around the PDMS surfaces. We not only maintained the humid environment around the microfluidic chip, rather we keep the wet towel directly on top of the PDMS microfluidic device. Placing a wet towel directly on top of the PDMS layer is equivalent to submerging the device in water. A blue surgical towel was attached on top of the PDMS layer and soaked with 5 mL of DI water. Another piece of the towel was attached to the bottom side of the WLA platform and again soaked with 7.5 mL of DI water. Once these moist towels were attached, the entire WLA was kept inside a Bitran™ bag. The excess bag was folded over the WLA and then put into a secondary Bitran bag. Humidity sensors were placed inside the primary bag, and a 9-week storage experiment was conducted. We observed less than 1% loss in humidity during the test period indicating that our approach to preventing moisture loss and minimizing bubbles within NemaFlex-S devices was successful. This technique helps in maintaining the hydrophilicity of the microfluidic device and prevents the formation/nucleation of air bubbles in the NemaFlex-S devices.Ground testing of microfluidics-integrated hardware Upon integration of the WLA with the NemaFlex-S device and optimization of the worm loading protocol, we piloted a ground study to measure the muscle strength of wild-type C. elegans using the multi-generational culture protocol. The objective of the ground testing was to demonstrate the capability to implement the multi-generational culture, loading protocol, imaging session, and analysis of the videos. This allowed us to assess risks associated with maintaining sterile culture over the 8 weeks of experiment, achieving efficacious worm loading from a mixed population, and observing consistency in strength measurement of gravid adults given that all gravid animals may not be of the same age. Figure 7 shows the results of this ground study. The worm diameter at mid-length was also measured to assess the homogeneity of gravid adults occupied in the chambers, which were visually selected for strength analysis based on the presence of eggs. As shown in Fig. 7a, the gravid adult body diameter did not show a statistical difference between animal groups that were assessed during each time point during the experiment, suggesting that the protocols for culture and loading providing a sufficient number of animals suitable for strength evaluation.

Open in a new tab a Worm diameter over multiple generations. b Muscle strength over multiple generations. n = 32 for week 2, n = 36 for week 4, n = 38 for week 6, and n = 41 for week 8 (Supplementary Table 5). Error bars represent standard deviation. All the data pass the normality test. There is no significant difference between force values using one-way ANOVA with P = 0.8.Next, we analyzed the 60-s videos acquired for each gravid adult. We identify the pillar with the maximal deflection in each image and generate a cumulative probability distribution with all the maximal deflections. We use the 95th percentile of this maximal force distribution, referred to as f95, as a measure of muscle strength30. Since the worm body diameters at different time points were not significantly different from each other during this 8-week experiment, its effect on strength measurements was considered negligible. As expected, we did not find any statistical difference in the strength values for wild type on weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 (Fig. 7b).Flight launch and on-orbit operation In summary, this pilot study demonstrated that the experimental procedures developed for the microfluidics-integrated spaceflight hardware make the technology amenable to C. elegans muscle strength investigations on the ISS. Primary culture bags were prepared at Texas Tech University (TTU) with optimized worm densities (1000 Larve/mL) and shipped to Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), Norfolk in a temperature control box. The culture bags were inspected for any possible contamination by the TTU team at EVMS upon arrival and incubated at 20oC until flight turnover. The NemaFlex-S chips were assembled on the WLA board at EVMS by the payload developer (BioServe Space Technology). Given the success of the pilot study, the microfluidics-integrated hardware and culture bags were flown to the ISS on Feb 20th, 2021, as part of the Northrop Grumman Cygnus NG-15 cargo mission. The same number of WLA boards and culture bags were prepared for ground control and shipped to TTU by mimicking the approximately same temperature profile used in the launch. The culture bags were incubated at 20 °C in SABL, and the CeMM bags were stored at 4 °C after receiving them at the ISS. The worms were cultured for a week in microgravity conditions before conducting timepoint-1 activities. Astronauts Shannon Walker, Kathleen Rubins, and Michael Hopkins conducted the On-Orbit operation, with guidance provided to them by the authors of this study. The crew successfully inoculated the culture bags for subsequent time points by employing the culture protocol discussed in Sec. 2A. The worms were loaded into the NemaFlex-S chip, and the movement of worms in the NemaFlex-S chambers was recorded successfully. The experiment went well for 2 generations (time points 1 and 2), and sufficient movies were recorded for muscle strength analysis. We saw a drastic decline in the animal density for time point 3 and 4 in worms cultured at ISS, whereas ground control cultures grew as expected. The reasons for the decline are unknown to us. Preliminary investigations suggest that it could be due to radiation, contamination, or maybe a combination of both, which is yet to be ascertained. We also froze worm cultures after NemaFlex experiments to conduct gene expression studies, enabling us in the future to correlate muscle strength changes to alterations in gene expression. No drying or glass cracks were observed in the NemaFlex-S device over long-time storage. Additionally, no leakage was observed while transferring the cultures from one bag to another and while loading them into the NemaFlex-S device. Thus, the microfluidics-integrated spaceflight hardware for muscle strength investigations in C. elegans has been successfully launched and operated onboard at the ISS. Hundreds of videos were collected along with frozen culture samples for gene expression analysis – this data is being currently analyzed and the results will be reported in the future.Discussion With the human ambition of becoming multi-planetary species, there is a need to understand how the conditions of space (microgravity and radiation) affect the biology and physiology of species grown for multiple generations. Model organisms continue to play an important role in space biology investigations51. Conducting multi-generational studies in mammals on the ISS is a daunting task, however, the C. elegans model presents a unique opportunity for such investigations. Compared to vertebrates, the C. elegans model has significant advantages including a fast generation cycle, small form factor, low payload mass, and translational relevance due to conserved molecular mechanisms. Despite these advantages, conducting successful experiments on the ISS is a major technological feat since it requires the design and integration of crew-interfacing user-friendly, and safe flight hardware and operational protocols. The focus of our study is not only the design of the NemaFlex-S device, but its integration into the Worm Loading Apparatus (WLA) that the crew can use to conduct experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). Below, we discuss the challenges of conducting multigenerational studies and the impact that our microfluidics-integrated space-flight hardware can have on space-biology investigations in C. elegans. The major challenge for conducting multigenerational studies even in C. elegans is to identify suitable culture methods to breed them across generations while maintaining age-matched populations. The standard approach of culturing C. elegans for multiple generations on NGM plates that is typically done on Earth studies, is not suitable since (i) manual picking and transfer of animals to new plates to maintain synchronized populations is laborious and moreover, the open nature of the transfers represents a significant biohazard for ISS investigations. (ii) An additional constraint is the maintenance of defined bacterial population densities across the 8-week duration of our spaceflight experiment may present challenges since high bacterial density might limit oxygen availability for nematodes. To overcome these issues, we have cultured C. elegans inside FEP bags using chemical-defined liquid C. elegans maintenance media, which is being tested and used in the previous space mission’s38,52. The power of the C. elegans model is the availability of a large number of muscle mutants that can potentially serve as biological controls. However, most of these mutants were obtained by standard culture on NGM plates and bacterial diet, and their viability in CeMM across multiple generations remains an open question. Identifying mutants grown in CeMM is challenging as they not only need to be viable, but also their growth rates need to match wild-type animals so that optimized density is available to load into the NemaFlex-S device. In the future, more studies need to be conducted to identify muscle mutants that grow well in CeMM across multiple generations. In our study, since we have wild-type animals growing on Earth, they serve as a biological control to compare against space-bred worms. Therefore, any changes in muscle strength could be compared with respect to ground control. As summarized in Table 1, most flight studies conducted with C. elegans are confined to molecular analysis due to a lack of tools that can quantitate animal behavior, locomotion, and other physiological measures under the constraints imposed by spaceflight and crew time13,14,17,19,25,53,54. Development of new crew-compatible hardware is a major challenge since it requires close collaboration between scientists, payload developers, and space agencies; along with considerations of cost, upload mass, and foot-print requirements. Thus, most science-based investigations are limited by what hardware is available on the ISS. Microfluidic devices present a unique opportunity to capture in vivo physiology data for small animals like C. elegans on the ISS55,56. However, there has been a lack of microfluidics integrated flight-ready hardware that is compatible with crew requirements and can report on muscle physiology. In the present study, we validated microfluidic integrated hardware on Earth and successfully launched it to the ISS. The library of videos acquired from the spaceflight study along with the gene expression data from multiple generations of animals will be a valuable resource to the scientific community that has been enabled by our integrated technology. The advancements offered by this hardware are as follows: (i) The microfluidic device is suitable for sorting the gravid adult animals of a specific size from a mixed culture and allowing the removal of progenies. (ii) The microfluidic device is integrated with a leak-proof cassette that can retain the waste generated during the loading of the worms, and therefore prevent contamination of the workstation. (iii) The worm loading apparatus helps in loading the animals in the microfluidic device with minimal effort from the crew. Astronauts need to simply click on the pump program and change the knob position on the distribution valve. (iv) Convenient recording of low or high-resolution videos of the animal inside the chambers allowing access to whole-organism phenotypic data. As mentioned earlier, previous space missions were mostly limited to molecular analysis due to the lack of proper hardware. The integrated microfluidic hardware developed here is easy to use and opens new avenues for conducting behavioral and stress assays onboard ISS since the C. elegans model is widely accepted by the space biology community to understand the effects of short and long-term space missions. The hardware can be used for assessing the effect of environmental toxins, drugs, gut microbes, in-flight radiation, etc. The videos can be recorded based on the need of the study design and can be used to detect the changes in the behavior of the animal since behavioral alterations are an earlier indicator of toxic exposure than the death of the organism57. The current hardware can also be used to study aging since the physiological and pathological changes occurring in space-flight conditions are reminiscent of accelerated aging. Indeed, how the spaceflight environment affects animal lifespan and healthspan is not well understood. Attempts have been made in the past to understand aging in C. elegans in space14,58. However, these studies do not preserve the identity of the worms and use biomarkers to inform on aging, rather than actual lifespan or healthspan measurements. The current hardware provides the basic solution to both problems as synchronized animals can be housed individually in the chambers and image-based phenotypic data can be obtained. Implementing some degree of automation to the current hardware could enable facile aging investigations on the ISS while reducing crew time. The present study sets the stage for future space biology investigations on the ISS. Given that the C. elegans model is used in a variety of fundamental biology investigations ranging from behavior to neurobiology to aging, we anticipate that the NemaFlex-S devices used in this study will aid in such investigations. Additionally, our documented protocols for animal culture, animal loading, and the flow control system could be adapted to instrument a variety of C. elegans-based microfluidic devices already reported in the literature for spaceflight studies43–46,59. Successful completion of experiments with our technology over multigeneration in a microgravity environment opens the door for future discoveries using C. elegans as a model organism. Finally, the microfluidic technology developed in this work can also be of Earth benefit, since individuals can be monitored to understand how muscle atrophy occurs in a human disease setting and aging.Methods Worm culture preparation Wild-type Bristol isolate (N2) worms were maintained in CeMM (Cell Guidance Systems, Cambridge, UK). To start culturing the animals in CeMM, agar-grown animals were bleached, and the eggs were introduced into the CeMM. The stock culture was then maintained by transferring aliquots of animals to fresh CeMM before cultures became starved. For the initiation of NemaFlex experiments, approximately 1000 larvae from a stock culture were transferred into an FEP bag (Saint Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation, Ohio, USA) containing 20 mL of CeMM. The FEP bags were stored in the incubator at 20 ± 1 °C. A mixed population of the well-fed gravid adult animals was used for all force measurement experiments. Every other week, 1 mL aliquots from the culture bag were transferred to a new bag containing 19 mL of fresh CeMM to make a total of 20 mL to initiate the new subcultures.Thrashing assay To quickly assess the physical health of the animals, we performed a thrashing assay every other week. To measure the thrashing frequency, a 250-µL aliquot of worms was withdrawn from the culture bags and transferred into a Petri plate, and diluted with 2 mL of CeMM. The animals were left to acclimatize for 10 min. The number of body bends was manually counted under a dissecting microscope for 40 random individual worms for a period of 20 s at room temperature (20 ± 1 °C).Microfluidic device fabrication The micropillar-based NemaFlex-S device was fabricated using a 2-step soft lithography process. The mold was fabricated in SU-8 2050 negative photoresist (Microchem) on a 4” silicon wafer as a substrate. First, a 20-µm tall photoresist layer was fabricated, which forms the boundary of the NemaFlex chamber. On top of this layer, a second layer of 80 µm height was fabricated with cylindrical holes that form the micropillars. This two-layer approach provides a total chamber depth of approximately 100 µm and creates deformable pillars of height 80 µm. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices of thickness 4.25 ± 0.25 mm thick were cast using Sylgard 184 part A (base) and part B (curing agent) (Dow Corning) 10:1 by weight over the SU-8 mold by curing for ∼2 h at 70 ± 1 °C. Inlet, outlet, and air vent holes were cored with a 1 mm hole puncher (Accuderm, Florida, USA). The devices were thoroughly cleaned with scotch tape to remove any dirt before bonding. The PDMS replica was then treated in an air-plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY) for the 90 s and bonded to a 2”×3” glass slide. Bonding was done while ensuring the pillars did not collapse or deform. The bonded devices were immediately kept in the oven for 10 min at 70 ± 1 °C. Devices were then treated with 5 wt% Pluronic F127 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min to prevent any bacterial build-up and also to help reduce bubble formation during worm loading. After incubation, excess Pluronic was removed by washing the devices with DI water. The Pluronic-treated devices were soaked in DI water overnight at 20 ± 1 °C to release any air bubbles from the device. The PDMS devices were then integrated into WLA and kept in double Bitran bags and stored at ambient temperature until the day of the experiment.Image acquisition and processing The worms were loaded into NemaFlex-S chambers using the procedure described in the main text. The animals were allowed to habituate in the micropillar arena for approximately 10 min before imaging. One-minute-long videos of crawling worms were acquired with Nikon inverted microscope (Eclipse TS 100) at 4X magnification with a field of view of 1920 × 1080 pixels. All videos were recorded at a temperature of 22 ± 1 °C. The recorded movies were processed offline using custom routines written in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2018b) for quantitation of pillar displacements as discussed by Rahman et al.30. Worm diameters were measured manually using ImageJ 1.48 v.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (201KB, pdf) Supplementary Video (3.7MB, avi) Reporting Summary (1.5MB, pdf) Acknowledgements This work was supported by funding from NASA (Grant No. NNX15AL16G and NNJ15GK01C) and BBSRC (Grant No. BB/N015894/1).Author contributions P.S. and T.A. performed the loading experiments.

    "abstract": "Abstract The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is used in a variety of applications ranging from fundamental biological studies, to drug screening, to disease modeling, and to space-biology investigations. These applications rely on conducting whole-organism phenotypic assays involving animal behavior and locomotion. In this study, we report a 3D printed compact imaging platform (CIP) that is integrated with a smart-device camera for the whole-organism phenotyping of C. elegans. The CIP has no external optical elements and does not require mechanical focusing, simplifying the optical configuration. The small footprint of the system powered with a standard USB provides capabilities ranging from plug-and-play, to parallel operation, and to housing it in incubators for temperature control. We demonstrate on Earth the compatibility of the CIP with different C. elegans substrates, including agar plates, liquid droplets on glass slides and microfluidic chips. We validate the system with behavioral and thrashing assays and show that the phenotypic readouts are in good agreement with the literature data. We conduct a pilot study with mutants and show that the phenotypic data collected from the CIP distinguishes these mutants. Finally, we discuss how the simplicity and versatility offered by CIP makes it amenable to future C. elegans investigations on the International Space Station, where science experiments are constrained by system size, payload weight and crew time. Overall, the compactness, portability and ease-of-use makes the CIP desirable for research and educational outreach applications on Earth and in space. Keywords: C. elegans, phenotyping, microfluidics, spaceflight imaging",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Whole-organism phenotypic assays are a foundational tool for basic biology investigations, drug screening and disease-focused studies [1,2,3,4]. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is particularly relevant for phenotypic screening due to its small size (≈1 mm), fast reproductive cycle (≈3 days), short lifespan (≈3 weeks), amenability to genetic manipulation and significant translational relevance [5,6,7]. Its small size and ease of culture offer the ability to phenotype large populations offering statistical power, which can be a challenge with vertebrate models. Whole-organism phenotypic readouts in C. elegans typically involve examining animal behavior, locomotory prowess and survival in response to changes in environment [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. The numerous advantages that underscore the use of C. elegans as a genetic model on Earth also translate to its use in spaceflight as a cost-effective organism to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of microgravity and radiation exposure on astronaut health. Indeed, C. elegans have been flown several times to the International Space Station (ISS) [16,17,18,19,20]. The conducting of animal experiments on the ISS is associated with stringent operational requirements on payload size, weight, crew time and safety [21,22]. C. elegans offers a facile means to address these requirements, making it an efficient model for space-biology investigations. Standard microscopes have been the workhorse for image-based whole-organism phenotyping in C. elegans. The need to increase assay throughout and reduce costs has led to the development of a variety of bespoke imaging solutions. Approaches range from the use of scanners for parallel imaging of nematodes on agar plates [23,24] to compact do-it-yourself (DIY) systems based on Raspberry Pi cameras [25,26,27] and smartphones [10,28,29]. Scanners offer a convenient means to increase C. elegans assay throughout, but are bulky and generate heat that requires significant customization to maintain temperature during the assay [23]. The Raspberry Pi camera approach offers on-board computation, making it attractive; however, it requires an external display for viewing and keyboard, which can be cumbersome, especially for ISS experiments. The smartphone microscopy approach has promise to create compact, portable C. elegans imaging systems with high-resolution displays and on-board computation. Current methods focus on high-magnification and multi-contrast imaging of C. elegans, lending to the inclusion of optical and mechanical elements [10,26,28,29]. These elements increase the complexity of the optical configuration and system size/weight. Considerations on power requirements, parallel experimentation and assay temperature control have received less attention, which are essential for spaceflight studies. Since C. elegans assays are conducted in a variety of substrates, compatibility with these substrates will broaden the utility of such compact systems. Finally, thorough validation and mutant phenotypic data needs to be generated from smartphone microscopy studies that will lower barriers for adoption in research and educational settings. In this study, we report a small foot-print smart-device imaging system called Compact Imaging Platform (CIP) that can acquire videos of C. elegans in agar plates, liquid droplets on a glass slide and microfluidic devices. The system has no external optical or mechanical elements, thereby reducing the complexity for imaging. The CIP is powered by USB and can be housed in standard incubators offering a plug-and-play approach for science investigations on Earth and in space. We conducted validation and mutant studies on Earth to show the promise of CIP for C. elegans phenotypic assays.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods Worm culture. Animals were cultured in 60 mm nematode growth medium (NGM) petri plates with 150–200 µL E. Coli OP50 at 20 °C. Synchronized animals at day 5 from hatching were used in all the assays performed. For this paper, the strains used were wild-type Bristol (N2), CB189 unc-32(e189) III., and CB1068 unc-79(e1086) III. Plate assay. Twenty-four age-synced animals were transferred to 35 mm nematode growth medium (NGM) petri plates. The plates were seeded 12 h prior to animal transfer so that the bacteria lawn was fresh and thin to obtain good quality contrast between animals and background. Microfluidic chip assay. Microfluidic devices were fabricated using standard SU-8 soft lithography techniques [62] in polydimethyl(siloxane). The design of the micropillar array is similar to that of Rahman et al., with a pillar diameter of 70 μm, gap of 90 μm and a chamber height of 110 μm. Animals were loaded inside the chip using a 1 mL syringe connected with a 0.032″ ID Tygon tubing (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) with a stainless-steel coupler tube (Instech Labs, FL). Synchronized animals in an NGM plate were flooded with liquid NGM and then transferred to an empty plate. Using a syringe, approximately 65 animals were aspirated from the plate and loaded inside the chip using the loading port. The chip was then flushed with liquid NGM, followed by an addition of 20 mg/mL E. coli OP50. Thrashing assay. Synchronized animals in an NGM plate were flooded with liquid NGM and then transferred to an empty plate. Three animals with 25 µL of liquid NGM were aspirated and transferred to each well of the glass slide (Tekdon Incorporated, Myakka City, FL, USA). Data analysis. To analyze the videos acquired from the plate and chip assay, we used the open-source software Image J with the plugin called wrMTrck. For the wildtype movies, thrashing data was also obtained using the wrMTrck plugin. For mutant thrashing assay, we played each movie and manually counted the thrashes. Each assay’s data were initially recorded in Microsoft Excel® (Version is 16.66.1) and then imported to GraphPad Prism software for visualization and statistical analysis. Types of statistical tests used in this study are included at the end of each figure caption.",
    "results": "2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Description of the Compact Imaging Platform and Its Components Design considerations such as light weight, compactness and low power consumption are not only relevant for Earth-based C. elegans applications, but become essential for spaceflight studies. For example, the ISS is a closed environment with limited workspace for conducting experimental investigations; moreover, payload size and weight become crucial factors dictating whether an experiment should be launched. Considering these needs, we designed and built a compact imaging platform (CIP). As shown in Figure 1, CIP is a small unit with length L = 7.5″, width W = 4.5″ and height, H = 5.5″, occupying a footprint area of ≈34 in2 and weighing ≈ 700 g. The footprint is primarily determined by the need to accommodate the smartphone system, a fan for temperature control and the C. elegans substrate. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Design of the Compact Imaging Platform and its functional capabilities. (a) The CIP consists of an imaging station to hold iPod Touch for imaging, a C. elegans substrate and a cooling fan for temperature control. It is powered by a 5 V USB cable. (b) The bottom section of the CIP showing the LED array and the USB component housing. (c) Multiple CIP units powered with a USB hub with the illumination turned on/off using a programmable timer. (d) Five CIP units stacked, operated in parallel and placed in an incubator with the timer.The mechanical design of the CIP is simple. It consists of two sections made from Polyamide 12 nylon material and printed using a multi-jet fusion 3D printer (HUBS, Chicago, IL, USA). The two sections are connected by hinges that allows their opening and closing (Figure 1a). The top section houses the iPod Touch camera (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA, USA), and the bottom section houses the C. elegans substrate, 6500 k pure white LED lights (Power Practical Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and a 6000-rpm cooling fan (Wathai, China) (Figure 1b). Thin rectangular slots of 20 mm × 2 mm are provided on the top and bottom sections, acting as air vents to achieve thermal equilibrium when the CIP is placed in a temperature-controlled environment. The thermal management system of the CIP works independently of the gravitational environment (ground or microgravity), due to active cooling and proper ventilation present in the system. The imaging configuration of the CIP involves dark-field imaging of C. elegans samples by using a fixed-height illumination source and the iPod Touch camera. The white LED lights in the bottom section are secured along the four walls, providing sidewise illumination to the specimen. No external optical elements or mechanical focusing is needed, making the design simple and user friendly. Autofocusing is achieved using a 3rd-party app (FiLMiC Pro, Seattle, WA, USA) on the iPod Touch. This app also allows for adjustment of the magnification, field of view and frame rate of video acquisition. The fixed focal distance configuration gives a field of view of 15 mm × 23 mm to 38 mm × 68 mm depending on the optical 3x zoom available on the app. Videos can be acquired at 1080p resolution with a frame rate of 3–30 fps, or time-lapse imaging can be performed with a delay ranging from 1–60 s. A smart-device camera such as the iPod Touch was chosen not only because of its ease of use on Earth, but also because of the specific advantages it provides for C. elegans experiments on the ISS. Unlike bulky conventional microscopy systems, it is a compact integrated imaging system that not only has optical elements for visualization, but also has a display (rather than a computer monitor) that allows the crew to inspect the animals and image quality. Additionally, the iPod Touch has the capacity to store up to ≈250 GB worth of data, allowing for recording of up to ≈810,000 images which enables short-term (e.g., about 1800 movies of 1.5 min duration at 5 fps) and long-term behavioral assays (e.g., about 45 h at 5 fps). Image acquisition aspects such as autofocusing and video capture rate can be easily controlled using the installed app. Finally, conducting science experiments with specialized hardware on the ISS requires significant astronaut training; however, the crew is familiar with using smartphone devices and associated apps, making our smart-device approach crew-friendly for spaceflight experiments. The CIP, integrated with the smart-device camera, is a 3 W (5 V, 0.6 A) low-powered system that can be battery operated if needed. The electrical requirement involves powering the LED lights and the cooling fan. Both elements are powered by a 5 V USB wall charger and a USB Type-A to Type-A cable. We chose this method because battery packs are available that can directly power our CIP using USB cables. This makes the CIP unit portable for field, educational and outer space applications. Thus, the operational simplicity of the CIP makes it attractive, compared to standard microscopes, to pursue phenotypic studies in C. elegans on Earth and for spaceflight studies. A major advantage of the USB-powered CIP unit is that multiple units can be powered simultaneously using a multi-port hub without the need for individual wall chargers (Figure 1c). In addition, a programmable timer can be added that controls illumination intervals for long-term assays. The plug-and-play nature of the CIP and its small footprint allows the parallel operation of several units inside a standard incubator (Figure 1d) with desired temperature control. This new capability allows multiple assays with the same or different strains to be conducted simultaneously in the same substrate or in different substrates (plates, microfluidic chips etc.). The ability to house the CIP in an incubator is also conducive for spaceflight investigations, as the ISS accommodates several incubators. For example, the Space Automated Bioproducts Laboratory (BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, CO, USA) is a dual-function freezer/incubator that supports life-sciences experiments on the ISS with a temperature control of −5 to 43 °C and accommodates 2 USB ports [30]. 2.2. Compatibility of the CIP with Different C. elegans Substrates Phenotypic assays in C. elegans often involve imaging animals placed on a variety of substrates, ranging from agar plates to liquid drops on glass slides to microfluidic devices. Here, we imaged wild-type animals crawling on agar plates, which is a translucent medium of thickness ≈ 5 mm (Figure 2a); animals swimming in sessile liquid drops of peak height ≈ 2 mm that partially wet a glass-slide (Figure 2b); and animals crawling in a microfluidic pillar chip that is filled with a liquid (Figure 2c) [12]. Each of these substrates have different refractive indices, optical path lengths and interfaces, which can alter the transmission of light and therefore can affect image contrast. Versatile imaging systems need to be capable of visualizing animals in these different substrates. We therefore tested the ability of the CIP to obtain sufficient-quality images when adult animals are housed in different substrates. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Compatibility of the CIP with various C. elegans substates. (a) Imaging of animals crawling on a 3 cm agar plate (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 24 animals. The green dye region indicates the bacterial lawn. (b) Imaging of animals thrashing in liquid drops (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 3 animals per drop. The field of view allows imaging of 6 wells. (c) Imaging of animals crawling in a microfluidic pillar arena (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 51 animals in the arena. The images were processed using Image J V 1.53 (, Maryland, USA), wrMTrck plugin.An important aspect of image-based assays in C. elegans is the analysis of images to quantify phenotypic readouts. Standard image processing techniques, for example, based on thresholding the intensity of the target objects against background intensity, work best when there is sufficient intensity contrast between the object and the background, and the objects occupy enough pixels for successful detection. Figure 2 shows representative images obtained from the three substrates using the CIP. We find that the images from these substrates are of sufficient quality such that the adult animals can be easily segmented using standard image processing software (ImageJ [31,32], wrMTrck plugin [33]). Under optimal imaging conditions, we find day 1 gravid adults to occupy ≈50 pixels when housed in the three substrates. This resolution allows these animals to be segmented easily against the background. Because of the field of view and the types of substrates, we find that the CIP is well suited to obtain phenotypic data from ≈20–50 animals, with the large-arena microfluidic chip providing data on more animals. 2.3. Controlling CIP Temperature during C. elegans Assays C. elegans’ behavior and survival is sensitive to temperature [34,35,36]. In addition, assays purposefully expose animals to different temperatures to investigate genes or compounds that impact thermotolerance [37,38]. Thus, C. elegans assays necessitate control over the environmental temperature. Often, the agar plates or microfluidic devices are kept in a temperature-controlled incubator and taken out for imaging on standard microscopes at room temperature. Alternatively, the temperature of these C. elegans substrates are controlled by passive or active thermal management strategies. Scanners use fans to control temperature [23], while some studies have used Peltier elements integrated with microfluidic devices assays [39]. The small size of the CIP system allows it to be placed in a temperature-controlled incubator (Figure 1d). The design of the CIP makes it an enclosed system housing the C. elegans substrates, since the top section (containing the smart-device camera) is brought in contact with the bottom section during imaging. The Initial trials showed that the main internal source of heat that the C. elegans substrates experience in the CIP is the radiant energy from the array of LED lights in the bottom section, which leads to an increase in temperature. To address this issue, we created ventilation slots in the enclosure and installed a cooling fan at the left wall of the bottom section. The forced convection from the cooling fan draws air from the ambient and distributes it through the ventilation slots. To test the ability to control the temperature of the C. elegans substrate housed in the CIP, we conducted experiments in which the system was placed in the incubator along with two temperature data loggers—one in the LED chamber and the other on the microfluidic chip (Figure 3a). This experiment was conducted for three set temperatures of 15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C of the incubator, and measurements were taken for 24 h. As shown in Figure 3b,c, in less than 2 h, the temperature stabilizes for all three set temperature conditions, with a variation that is less than 0.5 °C. We also note that the CIP temperature is about 1 °C above the set temperature, due to local heating, which can be compensated by lowering the incubator temperature. Thus, adequate temperature control can be achieved for C. elegans assays using the CIP. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Controlling temperature of CIP. (a) Temperature was measured at the top of the microfluidic chip and in the LED chamber. (b) Temperature profile collected over 24 h at set incubator temperatures of 15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C. The temperature data of LED chamber and the microfluidic chip are nearly identical. (c) Table showing mean temperature and standard deviation from all the three collection points. 2.4. Validation of the CIP with Behavioral Assays on Different C. elegans Substrates The CIP is a simple-to-use phenotyping system for C. elegans assays. In this section, we validate the system by performing standard behavioral assays on plates, liquid drops and microfluidic chips. We initially tested wild-type animals on Nematode Growth Media (NGM) plates to quantitate the locomotory readouts (Figure 4) obtained from the CIP and compare them with the data reported in literature. The CIP set up was similar to that shown in Figure 2a. Videos were recorded for 5 min at 10 fps, and data were analyzed with the wrMTrck plugin in ImageJ. Figure 4a shows the trajectory overlay that provides a qualitative visualization of the animal behavior on plates (Refer to SI Video 1 for processed video). We extracted the average forward speed and body wave frequency, and found the values to be ≈0.14 mm/s and ≈0.39 Hz (Figure 4d,e). These values are close to the reported values of ≈0.20 mm/s and ≈0.30 Hz in the literature [40,41]. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Validation of the CIP using C. elegans behavioral assays on a plate, a chip and liquid drops. (a–c) Overlay of tracks made by animals in the three substrates. (d) Average speed of animals on the three substrates. Plate, n = 24; chip, n = 51, p-value ≤ 0.0001; drop, n = 24, p-value < 0.0001. Animal age is day 5 from hatching. (e) Body bend frequency of animals on the three substrates. Plate, n = 24; chip, n = 51, p-value ≤ 0.0001; drop, n = 24, p-value < 0.0001. Animal age is day 5 from hatching; alpha = 0.05 for all analysis, nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test.Next, we tested the same animals in microfluidic chips that have an array of micropillars arranged in a square lattice, with a gap of 90 μm between pillars. Videos were recorded for 5 min at 10 fps. Figure 4b shows the trajectory overlay of animals crawling in the microfluidic chip (Refer to SI Video 2 for processed video). The average forward speed and body wave frequency were found to be ≈0.10 mm/s and ≈0.25 Hz (Figure 4d,e). In pillar arenas, the forward speed and body frequency depend on the pillar lattice arrangement and the animal confinement between the pillars [15,42,43]. Our locomotory data from the CIP is in good agreement with that of Rahman et al. [14], who reported values of ≈0.13 mm/s and ≈0.21 Hz. We also tested the same animals in a liquid drop on a glass slide with eight Teflon wells 8 mm in diameter. We transferred three animals in 25 µL of NGM liquid. Videos were recorded for 5 min at 10 fps. Figure 4c shows the trajectory of the overlay of animals swimming in the liquid drop (Refer to SI Video 3 for processed video). The average forward speed and body wave frequency were found to be ≈2.30 mm/s and ≈1.68 Hz (Figure 4d,e). This swim data are close to the reported values of ≈2.71 mm/s and ≈1.76 Hz in the literature [40]. 2.5. Phenotypic Studies with Mutants C. elegans has been an invaluable model organism for identifying the genetic basis of behavior and locomotion. There are many mutants that have been identified and classified based on automated image analysis, creating a behavioral database [44,45]. Since the CIP can accommodate a variety of C. elegans substrates, it could be a useful tool to perform phenotypic studies with mutants. Here, we conduct a pilot study with a wild type and two mutants—unc-32(e189) and unc-79(e1068). Hierarchical clustering showed that these two mutants exist in a different phenotypic space in the behavioral database [45], thus forming a testbed to evaluate the capabilities of the CIP. The unc-32 gene encodes the alpha subunit of a vacuolar ATP-ase (v-ATPase), an ATP-dependent proton pump which functions to regulate neurotransmitter trafficking through synaptic vesicles and cell acidification [46]. The unc-32(e189) mutation results in a reverse ventral coiling phenotype in the posterior region of the animals. Likewise, the unc-79 gene encodes a large cytosolic protein that is thought to regulate the post transcriptional processing of key voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels [47,48]. The unc-79(e1068) loss-of-function mutation results in a “fainting” phenotype that presents as repeating episodes of short bursts of normal movement that abruptly, but momentarily, stops [49]. Such unc-79 mutants have also shown to be defective in their ability to transition from crawling to swimming [50], a subtle behavioral phenotype that was previously undetectable using classical behavioral metrics. The unc-32(e189) was previously characterized using plate-based methods and has not been assessed in any other environment. We conducted thrashing and behavioral assays with the wild type and mutant animals to determine whether these assays, conducted with the CIP, could identify phenotypic differences. Figure 5 shows the thrashing frequency for the three strains, which was scored manually from the 1 min videos acquired from the CIP at 10 fps. The thrashing frequency of wild type, unc-32(e189) and unc-79(e1068) is ≈1.57, 0.07 and 1.29, respectively, indicating that mutants have swim defects compared to wildtype, and unc-32(e189) has the strongest swim deficiency. The value of the thrashing frequency for unc-79(e1068) obtained from the CIP is in good agreement with that found in literature [50,51]. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Thrashing assay performed on day 5 animals using CIP. Wild-type animals showed significant difference compared to both unc-79 (p-value < 0.0001) and unc-32 (p-value < 0.0001) mutants. n = 10 animals.; one-way ANOVA.Next, we studied the crawling behavior of these strains in the microfluidic chip. Since the microfluidic approach allows for the convenient removal and addition of reagents [12,13,52], we studied changes in animal behavior in the presence and absence of food. To perform this assay, day-4 animals were loaded into the chip, and on day 5 the food was removed, followed by a 5-min wait time before imaging (Figure 6a). Subsequently, food was added and imaging was performed after 5 min. The crawling tracks in Figure 6b,c visually reveal not only individual strain differences, but also show food-induced changes in behavior. Figure 6.

Wildtype, n = 155; unc-32(e189), n = 200, p-value < 0.0001 (avg. speed), p-value < 0.0001 (body bend); unc-79(e1068), n =175, p-value < 0.0001 (avg. speed), p-value < 0.0001 (body bend). (e) Quantification of average speed and body bend frequency of animal in the presence of food. Wildtype, n = 155; unc-32(e189), n = 200, p-value < 0.0001 (avg. speed), p-value = 0.0002 (body bend); unc-79(e1068), n =175, p-value < 0.0001 (avg. speed), p-value = 0.0.002 (body bend); alpha = 0.05 for all analysis, nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test.From the acquired videos, we quantified changes in the average forward speed and body wave frequency (Figure 6d,e). In the absence of food, the average forward speed of the mutants is statistically different from wildtype (Figure 6d, left) with unc-32(e189) being slower than unc-79(e1068). The body wave frequency of wildtype animals is higher than the mutants, but there is no difference between the mutants themselves. In the presence of food, the average forward speed of the mutants is still statistically different from the wildtype (Figure 6e, left), although the values tend to be lower compared to those in the absence of food. Interestingly, the mutants do not show significant differences in forward speed when food is present. With regards to body wave frequency, there is no apparent difference between the three strains. Thus, the data from the CIP shows that the thrashing frequency in liquid and the forward crawling speed in the absence of food are better phenotypes to distinguish the strains. These results highlight that the CIP is a versatile tool to conduct mutant phenotyping studies using different C. elegans substrates. 2.6. Relevance of CIP for C. elegans Spaceflight Studies Significant physiological changes occur during long-duration space travel, necessitating a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that induce these alterations [53,54]. Thus, model organisms such as C. elegans have been flown to the International Space Station (ISS) several times for space-biology investigations [16,17,18,19,55,56,57,58,59,60]. For spaceflight missions where payload size and weight are critical considerations, C. elegans experimental payloads offer a small-form factor and a significant reduction in weight compared with vertebrates. Moreover, the fast reproductive cycle enables multi-generational studies to be conducted, providing an opportunity to explore physiological adaptations due to long-term habitation in space. These advantages and mutant resources make C. elegans a leading invertebrate animal model for spaceflight studies. Despite several C. elegans studies on ISS, most of the spaceflight data is limited to changes in gene expression and fluorescent markers, and there is a dearth of whole-organism phenotypic data. The major challenges for ISS investigations are the availability of microscopy hardware, access to crew time to conduct the studies, and payload weight/size requirements for imaging instrumentation. Standard microscopes available on ISS are bulky, require significant crew training, have a limited field of view to do large-population imaging, rely on bulky monitors for crews to visualize samples, and data store/transfer needs are demanding. These limitations necessitate the need for custom-designed imaging hardware for gathering whole-animal phenotypic data to understand the effects of microgravity and radiation on C. elegans physiology. The compact imaging system developed in this study addresses the current limitations for phenotyping C. elegans on the ISS. The CIP has <1 kg payload requirement and occupies < 1 ft3. It is simple to use for crews and is a USB-powered plug-and-play device. The large field of view enables the interrogation of animal populations and provides a robust statistical evaluation of phenotypic data. Sample visualization and data storage needs are integrated into a small form-factor smart-device. Video data could be returned to Earth, and data analysis could be performed post-facto, thereby allowing the crew time to focus more on worm sample loading and basic payload handling. Different C. elegans substrates can be integrated into the CIP based on science requirements, and the microfluidic chips are particularly appealing due to their enclosed configuration that allows the maintaining of a sterile environment and efficient fluid handling. Nematode sample preparation usually occurs on Earth, with worm culture bags being flown to the ISS, where the crew extracts samples and injects into the microfluidic chips. The authors have recently flown to the ISS micropillar-based microfluidic devices for muscle strength measurements in C. elegans [20], and the CIP is a valuable addition to the imaging needs on the ISS.",
    "discussion": "2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Description of the Compact Imaging Platform and Its Components Design considerations such as light weight, compactness and low power consumption are not only relevant for Earth-based C. elegans applications, but become essential for spaceflight studies. For example, the ISS is a closed environment with limited workspace for conducting experimental investigations; moreover, payload size and weight become crucial factors dictating whether an experiment should be launched. Considering these needs, we designed and built a compact imaging platform (CIP). As shown in Figure 1, CIP is a small unit with length L = 7.5″, width W = 4.5″ and height, H = 5.5″, occupying a footprint area of ≈34 in2 and weighing ≈ 700 g. The footprint is primarily determined by the need to accommodate the smartphone system, a fan for temperature control and the C. elegans substrate. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Design of the Compact Imaging Platform and its functional capabilities. (a) The CIP consists of an imaging station to hold iPod Touch for imaging, a C. elegans substrate and a cooling fan for temperature control. It is powered by a 5 V USB cable. (b) The bottom section of the CIP showing the LED array and the USB component housing. (c) Multiple CIP units powered with a USB hub with the illumination turned on/off using a programmable timer. (d) Five CIP units stacked, operated in parallel and placed in an incubator with the timer.The mechanical design of the CIP is simple. It consists of two sections made from Polyamide 12 nylon material and printed using a multi-jet fusion 3D printer (HUBS, Chicago, IL, USA). The two sections are connected by hinges that allows their opening and closing (Figure 1a). The top section houses the iPod Touch camera (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA, USA), and the bottom section houses the C. elegans substrate, 6500 k pure white LED lights (Power Practical Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and a 6000-rpm cooling fan (Wathai, China) (Figure 1b). Thin rectangular slots of 20 mm × 2 mm are provided on the top and bottom sections, acting as air vents to achieve thermal equilibrium when the CIP is placed in a temperature-controlled environment. The thermal management system of the CIP works independently of the gravitational environment (ground or microgravity), due to active cooling and proper ventilation present in the system. The imaging configuration of the CIP involves dark-field imaging of C. elegans samples by using a fixed-height illumination source and the iPod Touch camera. The white LED lights in the bottom section are secured along the four walls, providing sidewise illumination to the specimen. No external optical elements or mechanical focusing is needed, making the design simple and user friendly. Autofocusing is achieved using a 3rd-party app (FiLMiC Pro, Seattle, WA, USA) on the iPod Touch. This app also allows for adjustment of the magnification, field of view and frame rate of video acquisition. The fixed focal distance configuration gives a field of view of 15 mm × 23 mm to 38 mm × 68 mm depending on the optical 3x zoom available on the app. Videos can be acquired at 1080p resolution with a frame rate of 3–30 fps, or time-lapse imaging can be performed with a delay ranging from 1–60 s. A smart-device camera such as the iPod Touch was chosen not only because of its ease of use on Earth, but also because of the specific advantages it provides for C. elegans experiments on the ISS. Unlike bulky conventional microscopy systems, it is a compact integrated imaging system that not only has optical elements for visualization, but also has a display (rather than a computer monitor) that allows the crew to inspect the animals and image quality. Additionally, the iPod Touch has the capacity to store up to ≈250 GB worth of data, allowing for recording of up to ≈810,000 images which enables short-term (e.g., about 1800 movies of 1.5 min duration at 5 fps) and long-term behavioral assays (e.g., about 45 h at 5 fps). Image acquisition aspects such as autofocusing and video capture rate can be easily controlled using the installed app. Finally, conducting science experiments with specialized hardware on the ISS requires significant astronaut training; however, the crew is familiar with using smartphone devices and associated apps, making our smart-device approach crew-friendly for spaceflight experiments. The CIP, integrated with the smart-device camera, is a 3 W (5 V, 0.6 A) low-powered system that can be battery operated if needed. The electrical requirement involves powering the LED lights and the cooling fan. Both elements are powered by a 5 V USB wall charger and a USB Type-A to Type-A cable. We chose this method because battery packs are available that can directly power our CIP using USB cables. This makes the CIP unit portable for field, educational and outer space applications. Thus, the operational simplicity of the CIP makes it attractive, compared to standard microscopes, to pursue phenotypic studies in C. elegans on Earth and for spaceflight studies. A major advantage of the USB-powered CIP unit is that multiple units can be powered simultaneously using a multi-port hub without the need for individual wall chargers (Figure 1c). In addition, a programmable timer can be added that controls illumination intervals for long-term assays. The plug-and-play nature of the CIP and its small footprint allows the parallel operation of several units inside a standard incubator (Figure 1d) with desired temperature control. This new capability allows multiple assays with the same or different strains to be conducted simultaneously in the same substrate or in different substrates (plates, microfluidic chips etc.). The ability to house the CIP in an incubator is also conducive for spaceflight investigations, as the ISS accommodates several incubators. For example, the Space Automated Bioproducts Laboratory (BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, CO, USA) is a dual-function freezer/incubator that supports life-sciences experiments on the ISS with a temperature control of −5 to 43 °C and accommodates 2 USB ports [30]. 2.2. Compatibility of the CIP with Different C. elegans Substrates Phenotypic assays in C. elegans often involve imaging animals placed on a variety of substrates, ranging from agar plates to liquid drops on glass slides to microfluidic devices. Here, we imaged wild-type animals crawling on agar plates, which is a translucent medium of thickness ≈ 5 mm (Figure 2a); animals swimming in sessile liquid drops of peak height ≈ 2 mm that partially wet a glass-slide (Figure 2b); and animals crawling in a microfluidic pillar chip that is filled with a liquid (Figure 2c) [12]. Each of these substrates have different refractive indices, optical path lengths and interfaces, which can alter the transmission of light and therefore can affect image contrast. Versatile imaging systems need to be capable of visualizing animals in these different substrates. We therefore tested the ability of the CIP to obtain sufficient-quality images when adult animals are housed in different substrates. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Compatibility of the CIP with various C. elegans substates. (a) Imaging of animals crawling on a 3 cm agar plate (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 24 animals. The green dye region indicates the bacterial lawn. (b) Imaging of animals thrashing in liquid drops (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 3 animals per drop. The field of view allows imaging of 6 wells. (c) Imaging of animals crawling in a microfluidic pillar arena (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 51 animals in the arena. The images were processed using Image J V 1.53 (, Maryland, USA), wrMTrck plugin.An important aspect of image-based assays in C. elegans is the analysis of images to quantify phenotypic readouts. Standard image processing techniques, for example, based on thresholding the intensity of the target objects against background intensity, work best when there is sufficient intensity contrast between the object and the background, and the objects occupy enough pixels for successful detection. Figure 2 shows representative images obtained from the three substrates using the CIP. We find that the images from these substrates are of sufficient quality such that the adult animals can be easily segmented using standard image processing software (ImageJ [31,32], wrMTrck plugin [33]). Under optimal imaging conditions, we find day 1 gravid adults to occupy ≈50 pixels when housed in the three substrates. This resolution allows these animals to be segmented easily against the background. Because of the field of view and the types of substrates, we find that the CIP is well suited to obtain phenotypic data from ≈20–50 animals, with the large-arena microfluidic chip providing data on more animals. 2.3. Controlling CIP Temperature during C. elegans Assays C. elegans’ behavior and survival is sensitive to temperature [34,35,36]. In addition, assays purposefully expose animals to different temperatures to investigate genes or compounds that impact thermotolerance [37,38]. Thus, C. elegans assays necessitate control over the environmental temperature. Often, the agar plates or microfluidic devices are kept in a temperature-controlled incubator and taken out for imaging on standard microscopes at room temperature. Alternatively, the temperature of these C. elegans substrates are controlled by passive or active thermal management strategies. Scanners use fans to control temperature [23], while some studies have used Peltier elements integrated with microfluidic devices assays [39]. The small size of the CIP system allows it to be placed in a temperature-controlled incubator (Figure 1d). The design of the CIP makes it an enclosed system housing the C. elegans substrates, since the top section (containing the smart-device camera) is brought in contact with the bottom section during imaging. The Initial trials showed that the main internal source of heat that the C. elegans substrates experience in the CIP is the radiant energy from the array of LED lights in the bottom section, which leads to an increase in temperature. To address this issue, we created ventilation slots in the enclosure and installed a cooling fan at the left wall of the bottom section. The forced convection from the cooling fan draws air from the ambient and distributes it through the ventilation slots. To test the ability to control the temperature of the C. elegans substrate housed in the CIP, we conducted experiments in which the system was placed in the incubator along with two temperature data loggers—one in the LED chamber and the other on the microfluidic chip (Figure 3a). This experiment was conducted for three set temperatures of 15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C of the incubator, and measurements were taken for 24 h. As shown in Figure 3b,c, in less than 2 h, the temperature stabilizes for all three set temperature conditions, with a variation that is less than 0.5 °C. We also note that the CIP temperature is about 1 °C above the set temperature, due to local heating, which can be compensated by lowering the incubator temperature. Thus, adequate temperature control can be achieved for C. elegans assays using the CIP. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Controlling temperature of CIP. (a) Temperature was measured at the top of the microfluidic chip and in the LED chamber. (b) Temperature profile collected over 24 h at set incubator temperatures of 15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C. The temperature data of LED chamber and the microfluidic chip are nearly identical. (c) Table showing mean temperature and standard deviation from all the three collection points. 2.4. Validation of the CIP with Behavioral Assays on Different C. elegans Substrates The CIP is a simple-to-use phenotyping system for C. elegans assays. In this section, we validate the system by performing standard behavioral assays on plates, liquid drops and microfluidic chips. We initially tested wild-type animals on Nematode Growth Media (NGM) plates to quantitate the locomotory readouts (Figure 4) obtained from the CIP and compare them with the data reported in literature. The CIP set up was similar to that shown in Figure 2a. Videos were recorded for 5 min at 10 fps, and data were analyzed with the wrMTrck plugin in ImageJ. Figure 4a shows the trajectory overlay that provides a qualitative visualization of the animal behavior on plates (Refer to SI Video 1 for processed video). We extracted the average forward speed and body wave frequency, and found the values to be ≈0.14 mm/s and ≈0.39 Hz (Figure 4d,e). These values are close to the reported values of ≈0.20 mm/s and ≈0.30 Hz in the literature [40,41]. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Validation of the CIP using C. elegans behavioral assays on a plate, a chip and liquid drops. (a–c) Overlay of tracks made by animals in the three substrates. (d) Average speed of animals on the three substrates. Plate, n = 24; chip, n = 51, p-value ≤ 0.0001; drop, n = 24, p-value < 0.0001. Animal age is day 5 from hatching. (e) Body bend frequency of animals on the three substrates. Plate, n = 24; chip, n = 51, p-value ≤ 0.0001; drop, n = 24, p-value < 0.0001. Animal age is day 5 from hatching; alpha = 0.05 for all analysis, nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test.Next, we tested the same animals in microfluidic chips that have an array of micropillars arranged in a square lattice, with a gap of 90 μm between pillars. Videos were recorded for 5 min at 10 fps. Figure 4b shows the trajectory overlay of animals crawling in the microfluidic chip (Refer to SI Video 2 for processed video). The average forward speed and body wave frequency were found to be ≈0.10 mm/s and ≈0.25 Hz (Figure 4d,e). In pillar arenas, the forward speed and body frequency depend on the pillar lattice arrangement and the animal confinement between the pillars [15,42,43]. Our locomotory data from the CIP is in good agreement with that of Rahman et al. [14], who reported values of ≈0.13 mm/s and ≈0.21 Hz. We also tested the same animals in a liquid drop on a glass slide with eight Teflon wells 8 mm in diameter. We transferred three animals in 25 µL of NGM liquid. Videos were recorded for 5 min at 10 fps. Figure 4c shows the trajectory of the overlay of animals swimming in the liquid drop (Refer to SI Video 3 for processed video). The average forward speed and body wave frequency were found to be ≈2.30 mm/s and ≈1.68 Hz (Figure 4d,e). This swim data are close to the reported values of ≈2.71 mm/s and ≈1.76 Hz in the literature [40]. 2.5.

    "conclusion": "3. Conclusions In this study, we report a compact imaging platform and successfully demonstrated that it can be used to acquire whole-organism phenotypic data using a variety of C. elegans substrates. We show that good temperature control can be achieved for assays, and that multiple CIP units can be used if needed to conduct parallel experiments. The videos acquired are compatible for analysis with established software tools. The C. elegans community continues to develop a variety of open-source image analysis tools [61] that could be potentially used to analyze images acquired from the CIP to increase the depth of phenotyping. The hardware of CIP as demonstrated here could be further improved. In addition to the smart-device camera, additional high-magnification optics could be integrated to provide higher-resolution images to pursue deep phenotyping, including access to organ-level information. Although we used the iPod Touch in this study, the 3D-printed imaging station concept can be extended to other low-cost cameras (e.g., Arducam series), along with Raspberry Pi integration. Opportunities exist to integrate additional hardware elements to study animal response to stimuli such as light, temperature and electric fields, which will broaden the types of assays that can be conducted.

Copyright notice ID: 9862956 PMID: 36676149 Abstract The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is used in a variety of applications ranging from fundamental biological studies, to drug screening, to disease modeling, and to space-biology investigations. These applications rely on conducting whole-organism phenotypic assays involving animal behavior and locomotion. In this study, we report a 3D printed compact imaging platform (CIP) that is integrated with a smart-device camera for the whole-organism phenotyping of C. elegans. The CIP has no external optical elements and does not require mechanical focusing, simplifying the optical configuration. The small footprint of the system powered with a standard USB provides capabilities ranging from plug-and-play, to parallel operation, and to housing it in incubators for temperature control. We demonstrate on Earth the compatibility of the CIP with different C. elegans substrates, including agar plates, liquid droplets on glass slides and microfluidic chips. We validate the system with behavioral and thrashing assays and show that the phenotypic readouts are in good agreement with the literature data. We conduct a pilot study with mutants and show that the phenotypic data collected from the CIP distinguishes these mutants. Finally, we discuss how the simplicity and versatility offered by CIP makes it amenable to future C. elegans investigations on the International Space Station, where science experiments are constrained by system size, payload weight and crew time. Overall, the compactness, portability and ease-of-use makes the CIP desirable for research and educational outreach applications on Earth and in space. Keywords: C. elegans, phenotyping, microfluidics, spaceflight imaging1. Introduction Whole-organism phenotypic assays are a foundational tool for basic biology investigations, drug screening and disease-focused studies [1,2,3,4]. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is particularly relevant for phenotypic screening due to its small size (≈1 mm), fast reproductive cycle (≈3 days), short lifespan (≈3 weeks), amenability to genetic manipulation and significant translational relevance [5,6,7]. Its small size and ease of culture offer the ability to phenotype large populations offering statistical power, which can be a challenge with vertebrate models. Whole-organism phenotypic readouts in C. elegans typically involve examining animal behavior, locomotory prowess and survival in response to changes in environment [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. The numerous advantages that underscore the use of C. elegans as a genetic model on Earth also translate to its use in spaceflight as a cost-effective organism to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of microgravity and radiation exposure on astronaut health. Indeed, C. elegans have been flown several times to the International Space Station (ISS) [16,17,18,19,20]. The conducting of animal experiments on the ISS is associated with stringent operational requirements on payload size, weight, crew time and safety [21,22]. C. elegans offers a facile means to address these requirements, making it an efficient model for space-biology investigations. Standard microscopes have been the workhorse for image-based whole-organism phenotyping in C. elegans. The need to increase assay throughout and reduce costs has led to the development of a variety of bespoke imaging solutions. Approaches range from the use of scanners for parallel imaging of nematodes on agar plates [23,24] to compact do-it-yourself (DIY) systems based on Raspberry Pi cameras [25,26,27] and smartphones [10,28,29]. Scanners offer a convenient means to increase C. elegans assay throughout, but are bulky and generate heat that requires significant customization to maintain temperature during the assay [23]. The Raspberry Pi camera approach offers on-board computation, making it attractive; however, it requires an external display for viewing and keyboard, which can be cumbersome, especially for ISS experiments. The smartphone microscopy approach has promise to create compact, portable C. elegans imaging systems with high-resolution displays and on-board computation. Current methods focus on high-magnification and multi-contrast imaging of C. elegans, lending to the inclusion of optical and mechanical elements [10,26,28,29]. These elements increase the complexity of the optical configuration and system size/weight. Considerations on power requirements, parallel experimentation and assay temperature control have received less attention, which are essential for spaceflight studies. Since C. elegans assays are conducted in a variety of substrates, compatibility with these substrates will broaden the utility of such compact systems. Finally, thorough validation and mutant phenotypic data needs to be generated from smartphone microscopy studies that will lower barriers for adoption in research and educational settings. In this study, we report a small foot-print smart-device imaging system called Compact Imaging Platform (CIP) that can acquire videos of C. elegans in agar plates, liquid droplets on a glass slide and microfluidic devices. The system has no external optical or mechanical elements, thereby reducing the complexity for imaging. The CIP is powered by USB and can be housed in standard incubators offering a plug-and-play approach for science investigations on Earth and in space. We conducted validation and mutant studies on Earth to show the promise of CIP for C. elegans phenotypic assays.2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Description of the Compact Imaging Platform and Its Components Design considerations such as light weight, compactness and low power consumption are not only relevant for Earth-based C. elegans applications, but become essential for spaceflight studies. For example, the ISS is a closed environment with limited workspace for conducting experimental investigations; moreover, payload size and weight become crucial factors dictating whether an experiment should be launched. Considering these needs, we designed and built a compact imaging platform (CIP). As shown in Figure 1, CIP is a small unit with length L = 7.5″, width W = 4.5″ and height, H = 5.5″, occupying a footprint area of ≈34 in2 and weighing ≈ 700 g. The footprint is primarily determined by the need to accommodate the smartphone system, a fan for temperature control and the C. elegans substrate. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Design of the Compact Imaging Platform and its functional capabilities. (a) The CIP consists of an imaging station to hold iPod Touch for imaging, a C. elegans substrate and a cooling fan for temperature control. It is powered by a 5 V USB cable. (b) The bottom section of the CIP showing the LED array and the USB component housing. (c) Multiple CIP units powered with a USB hub with the illumination turned on/off using a programmable timer. (d) Five CIP units stacked, operated in parallel and placed in an incubator with the timer.The mechanical design of the CIP is simple. It consists of two sections made from Polyamide 12 nylon material and printed using a multi-jet fusion 3D printer (HUBS, Chicago, IL, USA). The two sections are connected by hinges that allows their opening and closing (Figure 1a). The top section houses the iPod Touch camera (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA, USA), and the bottom section houses the C. elegans substrate, 6500 k pure white LED lights (Power Practical Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and a 6000-rpm cooling fan (Wathai, China) (Figure 1b). Thin rectangular slots of 20 mm × 2 mm are provided on the top and bottom sections, acting as air vents to achieve thermal equilibrium when the CIP is placed in a temperature-controlled environment. The thermal management system of the CIP works independently of the gravitational environment (ground or microgravity), due to active cooling and proper ventilation present in the system. The imaging configuration of the CIP involves dark-field imaging of C. elegans samples by using a fixed-height illumination source and the iPod Touch camera. The white LED lights in the bottom section are secured along the four walls, providing sidewise illumination to the specimen. No external optical elements or mechanical focusing is needed, making the design simple and user friendly. Autofocusing is achieved using a 3rd-party app (FiLMiC Pro, Seattle, WA, USA) on the iPod Touch. This app also allows for adjustment of the magnification, field of view and frame rate of video acquisition. The fixed focal distance configuration gives a field of view of 15 mm × 23 mm to 38 mm × 68 mm depending on the optical 3x zoom available on the app. Videos can be acquired at 1080p resolution with a frame rate of 3–30 fps, or time-lapse imaging can be performed with a delay ranging from 1–60 s. A smart-device camera such as the iPod Touch was chosen not only because of its ease of use on Earth, but also because of the specific advantages it provides for C. elegans experiments on the ISS. Unlike bulky conventional microscopy systems, it is a compact integrated imaging system that not only has optical elements for visualization, but also has a display (rather than a computer monitor) that allows the crew to inspect the animals and image quality. Additionally, the iPod Touch has the capacity to store up to ≈250 GB worth of data, allowing for recording of up to ≈810,000 images which enables short-term (e.g., about 1800 movies of 1.5 min duration at 5 fps) and long-term behavioral assays (e.g., about 45 h at 5 fps). Image acquisition aspects such as autofocusing and video capture rate can be easily controlled using the installed app. Finally, conducting science experiments with specialized hardware on the ISS requires significant astronaut training; however, the crew is familiar with using smartphone devices and associated apps, making our smart-device approach crew-friendly for spaceflight experiments. The CIP, integrated with the smart-device camera, is a 3 W (5 V, 0.6 A) low-powered system that can be battery operated if needed. The electrical requirement involves powering the LED lights and the cooling fan. Both elements are powered by a 5 V USB wall charger and a USB Type-A to Type-A cable. We chose this method because battery packs are available that can directly power our CIP using USB cables. This makes the CIP unit portable for field, educational and outer space applications. Thus, the operational simplicity of the CIP makes it attractive, compared to standard microscopes, to pursue phenotypic studies in C. elegans on Earth and for spaceflight studies. A major advantage of the USB-powered CIP unit is that multiple units can be powered simultaneously using a multi-port hub without the need for individual wall chargers (Figure 1c). In addition, a programmable timer can be added that controls illumination intervals for long-term assays. The plug-and-play nature of the CIP and its small footprint allows the parallel operation of several units inside a standard incubator (Figure 1d) with desired temperature control. This new capability allows multiple assays with the same or different strains to be conducted simultaneously in the same substrate or in different substrates (plates, microfluidic chips etc.). The ability to house the CIP in an incubator is also conducive for spaceflight investigations, as the ISS accommodates several incubators. For example, the Space Automated Bioproducts Laboratory (BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, CO, USA) is a dual-function freezer/incubator that supports life-sciences experiments on the ISS with a temperature control of −5 to 43 °C and accommodates 2 USB ports [30].2.2. Compatibility of the CIP with Different C. elegans Substrates Phenotypic assays in C. elegans often involve imaging animals placed on a variety of substrates, ranging from agar plates to liquid drops on glass slides to microfluidic devices. Here, we imaged wild-type animals crawling on agar plates, which is a translucent medium of thickness ≈ 5 mm (Figure 2a); animals swimming in sessile liquid drops of peak height ≈ 2 mm that partially wet a glass-slide (Figure 2b); and animals crawling in a microfluidic pillar chip that is filled with a liquid (Figure 2c) [12]. Each of these substrates have different refractive indices, optical path lengths and interfaces, which can alter the transmission of light and therefore can affect image contrast. Versatile imaging systems need to be capable of visualizing animals in these different substrates. We therefore tested the ability of the CIP to obtain sufficient-quality images when adult animals are housed in different substrates. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Compatibility of the CIP with various C. elegans substates. (a) Imaging of animals crawling on a 3 cm agar plate (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 24 animals. The green dye region indicates the bacterial lawn. (b) Imaging of animals thrashing in liquid drops (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 3 animals per drop. The field of view allows imaging of 6 wells. (c) Imaging of animals crawling in a microfluidic pillar arena (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 51 animals in the arena. The images were processed using Image J V 1.53 (, Maryland, USA), wrMTrck plugin.An important aspect of image-based assays in C. elegans is the analysis of images to quantify phenotypic readouts. Standard image processing techniques, for example, based on thresholding the intensity of the target objects against background intensity, work best when there is sufficient intensity contrast between the object and the background, and the objects occupy enough pixels for successful detection. Figure 2 shows representative images obtained from the three substrates using the CIP. We find that the images from these substrates are of sufficient quality such that the adult animals can be easily segmented using standard image processing software (ImageJ [31,32], wrMTrck plugin [33]). Under optimal imaging conditions, we find day 1 gravid adults to occupy ≈50 pixels when housed in the three substrates. This resolution allows these animals to be segmented easily against the background. Because of the field of view and the types of substrates, we find that the CIP is well suited to obtain phenotypic data from ≈20–50 animals, with the large-arena microfluidic chip providing data on more animals.2.3. Controlling CIP Temperature during C. elegans Assays C. elegans’ behavior and survival is sensitive to temperature [34,35,36]. In addition, assays purposefully expose animals to different temperatures to investigate genes or compounds that impact thermotolerance [37,38]. Thus, C. elegans assays necessitate control over the environmental temperature. Often, the agar plates or microfluidic devices are kept in a temperature-controlled incubator and taken out for imaging on standard microscopes at room temperature. Alternatively, the temperature of these C. elegans substrates are controlled by passive or active thermal management strategies. Scanners use fans to control temperature [23], while some studies have used Peltier elements integrated with microfluidic devices assays [39]. The small size of the CIP system allows it to be placed in a temperature-controlled incubator (Figure 1d). The design of the CIP makes it an enclosed system housing the C. elegans substrates, since the top section (containing the smart-device camera) is brought in contact with the bottom section during imaging. The Initial trials showed that the main internal source of heat that the C. elegans substrates experience in the CIP is the radiant energy from the array of LED lights in the bottom section, which leads to an increase in temperature. To address this issue, we created ventilation slots in the enclosure and installed a cooling fan at the left wall of the bottom section. The forced convection from the cooling fan draws air from the ambient and distributes it through the ventilation slots. To test the ability to control the temperature of the C. elegans substrate housed in the CIP, we conducted experiments in which the system was placed in the incubator along with two temperature data loggers—one in the LED chamber and the other on the microfluidic chip (Figure 3a). This experiment was conducted for three set temperatures of 15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C of the incubator, and measurements were taken for 24 h. As shown in Figure 3b,c, in less than 2 h, the temperature stabilizes for all three set temperature conditions, with a variation that is less than 0.5 °C. We also note that the CIP temperature is about 1 °C above the set temperature, due to local heating, which can be compensated by lowering the incubator temperature. Thus, adequate temperature control can be achieved for C. elegans assays using the CIP. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Controlling temperature of CIP. (a) Temperature was measured at the top of the microfluidic chip and in the LED chamber. (b) Temperature profile collected over 24 h at set incubator temperatures of 15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C. The temperature data of LED chamber and the microfluidic chip are nearly identical. (c) Table showing mean temperature and standard deviation from all the three collection points.2.4. Validation of the CIP with Behavioral Assays on Different C. elegans Substrates The CIP is a simple-to-use phenotyping system for C. elegans assays. In this section, we validate the system by performing standard behavioral assays on plates, liquid drops and microfluidic chips. We initially tested wild-type animals on Nematode Growth Media (NGM) plates to quantitate the locomotory readouts (Figure 4) obtained from the CIP and compare them with the data reported in literature. The CIP set up was similar to that shown in Figure 2a. Videos were recorded for 5 min at 10 fps, and data were analyzed with the wrMTrck plugin in ImageJ. Figure 4a shows the trajectory overlay that provides a qualitative visualization of the animal behavior on plates (Refer to SI Video 1 for processed video). We extracted the average forward speed and body wave frequency, and found the values to be ≈0.14 mm/s and ≈0.39 Hz (Figure 4d,e). These values are close to the reported values of ≈0.20 mm/s and ≈0.30 Hz in the literature [40,41]. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Validation of the CIP using C. elegans behavioral assays on a plate, a chip and liquid drops. (a–c) Overlay of tracks made by animals in the three substrates. (d) Average speed of animals on the three substrates. Plate, n = 24; chip, n = 51, p-value ≤ 0.0001; drop, n = 24, p-value < 0.0001. Animal age is day 5 from hatching. (e) Body bend frequency of animals on the three substrates. Plate, n = 24; chip, n = 51, p-value ≤ 0.0001; drop, n = 24, p-value < 0.0001. Animal age is day 5 from hatching; alpha = 0.05 for all analysis, nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test.Next, we tested the same animals in microfluidic chips that have an array of micropillars arranged in a square lattice, with a gap of 90 μm between pillars. Videos were recorded for 5 min at 10 fps. Figure 4b shows the trajectory overlay of animals crawling in the microfluidic chip (Refer to SI Video 2 for processed video). The average forward speed and body wave frequency were found to be ≈0.10 mm/s and ≈0.25 Hz (Figure 4d,e). In pillar arenas, the forward speed and body frequency depend on the pillar lattice arrangement and the animal confinement between the pillars [15,42,43]. Our locomotory data from the CIP is in good agreement with that of Rahman et al. [14], who reported values of ≈0.13 mm/s and ≈0.21 Hz. We also tested the same animals in a liquid drop on a glass slide with eight Teflon wells 8 mm in diameter. We transferred three animals in 25 µL of NGM liquid. Videos were recorded for 5 min at 10 fps. Figure 4c shows the trajectory of the overlay of animals swimming in the liquid drop (Refer to SI Video 3 for processed video). The average forward speed and body wave frequency were found to be ≈2.30 mm/s and ≈1.68 Hz (Figure 4d,e). This swim data are close to the reported values of ≈2.71 mm/s and ≈1.76 Hz in the literature [40].2.5. Phenotypic Studies with Mutants C. elegans has been an invaluable model organism for identifying the genetic basis of behavior and locomotion. There are many mutants that have been identified and classified based on automated image analysis, creating a behavioral database [44,45]. Since the CIP can accommodate a variety of C. elegans substrates, it could be a useful tool to perform phenotypic studies with mutants. Here, we conduct a pilot study with a wild type and two mutants—unc-32(e189) and unc-79(e1068). Hierarchical clustering showed that these two mutants exist in a different phenotypic space in the behavioral database [45], thus forming a testbed to evaluate the capabilities of the CIP. The unc-32 gene encodes the alpha subunit of a vacuolar ATP-ase (v-ATPase), an ATP-dependent proton pump which functions to regulate neurotransmitter trafficking through synaptic vesicles and cell acidification [46]. The unc-32(e189) mutation results in a reverse ventral coiling phenotype in the posterior region of the animals. Likewise, the unc-79 gene encodes a large cytosolic protein that is thought to regulate the post transcriptional processing of key voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels [47,48]. The unc-79(e1068) loss-of-function mutation results in a “fainting” phenotype that presents as repeating episodes of short bursts of normal movement that abruptly, but momentarily, stops [49]. Such unc-79 mutants have also shown to be defective in their ability to transition from crawling to swimming [50], a subtle behavioral phenotype that was previously undetectable using classical behavioral metrics. The unc-32(e189) was previously characterized using plate-based methods and has not been assessed in any other environment. We conducted thrashing and behavioral assays with the wild type and mutant animals to determine whether these assays, conducted with the CIP, could identify phenotypic differences. Figure 5 shows the thrashing frequency for the three strains, which was scored manually from the 1 min videos acquired from the CIP at 10 fps. The thrashing frequency of wild type, unc-32(e189) and unc-79(e1068) is ≈1.57, 0.07 and 1.29, respectively, indicating that mutants have swim defects compared to wildtype, and unc-32(e189) has the strongest swim deficiency. The value of the thrashing frequency for unc-79(e1068) obtained from the CIP is in good agreement with that found in literature [50,51]. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Thrashing assay performed on day 5 animals using CIP. Wild-type animals showed significant difference compared to both unc-79 (p-value < 0.0001) and unc-32 (p-value < 0.0001) mutants. n = 10 animals.; one-way ANOVA.Next, we studied the crawling behavior of these strains in the microfluidic chip. Since the microfluidic approach allows for the convenient removal and addition of reagents [12,13,52], we studied changes in animal behavior in the presence and absence of food. To perform this assay, day-4 animals were loaded into the chip, and on day 5 the food was removed, followed by a 5-min wait time before imaging (Figure 6a). Subsequently, food was added and imaging was performed after 5 min. The crawling tracks in Figure 6b,c visually reveal not only individual strain differences, but also show food-induced changes in behavior. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Phenotypic studies with mutants using CIP. (a) Protocol used for conducting behavioral assays in the absence and presence of food using day 5 animals. Images were taken 5 min after washing and feeding to allow for acclimatization from the change in environment. (b,c) Overlay of animal tracks of wild-type and mutants in the absence and presence of food. (d) Quantification of average speed and body bend frequency of animal in the absence of food. Wildtype, n = 155; unc-32(e189), n = 200, p-value < 0.0001 (avg. speed), p-value < 0.0001 (body bend); unc-79(e1068), n =175, p-value < 0.0001 (avg. speed), p-value < 0.0001 (body bend). (e) Quantification of average speed and body bend frequency of animal in the presence of food. Wildtype, n = 155; unc-32(e189), n = 200, p-value < 0.0001 (avg. speed), p-value = 0.0002 (body bend); unc-79(e1068), n =175, p-value < 0.0001 (avg. speed), p-value = 0.0.002 (body bend); alpha = 0.05 for all analysis, nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test.From the acquired videos, we quantified changes in the average forward speed and body wave frequency (Figure 6d,e). In the absence of food, the average forward speed of the mutants is statistically different from wildtype (Figure 6d, left) with unc-32(e189) being slower than unc-79(e1068). The body wave frequency of wildtype animals is higher than the mutants, but there is no difference between the mutants themselves. In the presence of food, the average forward speed of the mutants is still statistically different from the wildtype (Figure 6e, left), although the values tend to be lower compared to those in the absence of food. Interestingly, the mutants do not show significant differences in forward speed when food is present. With regards to body wave frequency, there is no apparent difference between the three strains. Thus, the data from the CIP shows that the thrashing frequency in liquid and the forward crawling speed in the absence of food are better phenotypes to distinguish the strains. These results highlight that the CIP is a versatile tool to conduct mutant phenotyping studies using different C. elegans substrates.2.6. Relevance of CIP for C. elegans Spaceflight Studies Significant physiological changes occur during long-duration space travel, necessitating a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that induce these alterations [53,54]. Thus, model organisms such as C. elegans have been flown to the International Space Station (ISS) several times for space-biology investigations [16,17,18,19,55,56,57,58,59,60]. For spaceflight missions where payload size and weight are critical considerations, C. elegans experimental payloads offer a small-form factor and a significant reduction in weight compared with vertebrates. Moreover, the fast reproductive cycle enables multi-generational studies to be conducted, providing an opportunity to explore physiological adaptations due to long-term habitation in space. These advantages and mutant resources make C. elegans a leading invertebrate animal model for spaceflight studies. Despite several C. elegans studies on ISS, most of the spaceflight data is limited to changes in gene expression and fluorescent markers, and there is a dearth of whole-organism phenotypic data. The major challenges for ISS investigations are the availability of microscopy hardware, access to crew time to conduct the studies, and payload weight/size requirements for imaging instrumentation. Standard microscopes available on ISS are bulky, require significant crew training, have a limited field of view to do large-population imaging, rely on bulky monitors for crews to visualize samples, and data store/transfer needs are demanding. These limitations necessitate the need for custom-designed imaging hardware for gathering whole-animal phenotypic data to understand the effects of microgravity and radiation on C. elegans physiology. The compact imaging system developed in this study addresses the current limitations for phenotyping C. elegans on the ISS. The CIP has <1 kg payload requirement and occupies < 1 ft3. It is simple to use for crews and is a USB-powered plug-and-play device. The large field of view enables the interrogation of animal populations and provides a robust statistical evaluation of phenotypic data. Sample visualization and data storage needs are integrated into a small form-factor smart-device. Video data could be returned to Earth, and data analysis could be performed post-facto, thereby allowing the crew time to focus more on worm sample loading and basic payload handling. Different C. elegans substrates can be integrated into the CIP based on science requirements, and the microfluidic chips are particularly appealing due to their enclosed configuration that allows the maintaining of a sterile environment and efficient fluid handling. Nematode sample preparation usually occurs on Earth, with worm culture bags being flown to the ISS, where the crew extracts samples and injects into the microfluidic chips. The authors have recently flown to the ISS micropillar-based microfluidic devices for muscle strength measurements in C. elegans [20], and the CIP is a valuable addition to the imaging needs on the ISS.3. Conclusions In this study, we report a compact imaging platform and successfully demonstrated that it can be used to acquire whole-organism phenotypic data using a variety of C. elegans substrates. We show that good temperature control can be achieved for assays, and that multiple CIP units can be used if needed to conduct parallel experiments. The videos acquired are compatible for analysis with established software tools. The C. elegans community continues to develop a variety of open-source image analysis tools [61] that could be potentially used to analyze images acquired from the CIP to increase the depth of phenotyping. The hardware of CIP as demonstrated here could be further improved. In addition to the smart-device camera, additional high-magnification optics could be integrated to provide higher-resolution images to pursue deep phenotyping, including access to organ-level information. Although we used the iPod Touch in this study, the 3D-printed imaging station concept can be extended to other low-cost cameras (e.g., Arducam series), along with Raspberry Pi integration. Opportunities exist to integrate additional hardware elements to study animal response to stimuli such as light, temperature and electric fields, which will broaden the types of assays that can be conducted. With advances in computation and artificial intelligence, apps could be custom-designed to integrate with a smart-device that allows real-time image analysis, storage of assay metadata and data visualization. In summary, the CIP is a simple, versatile, low-cost and small-footprint phenotyping tool for C. elegans assays, that could be deployed in research and educational settings on Earth in its current form. The CIP also presents a proof of concept for future setups for space biology research and could be adapted for ISS-compatible hardware. In the future, the system needs to undergo thorough ISS certification in terms of flammability, materials, off-gassing, electromagnetic interface, etc., as the assessment of multiple factors like safety, system reliability and long-term storage for equipment performance is necessary.4. Materials and Methods Worm culture. Animals were cultured in 60 mm nematode growth medium (NGM) petri plates with 150–200 µL E. Coli OP50 at 20 °C. Synchronized animals at day 5 from hatching were used in all the assays performed. For this paper, the strains used were wild-type Bristol (N2), CB189 unc-32(e189) III., and CB1068 unc-79(e1086) III. Plate assay. Twenty-four age-synced animals were transferred to 35 mm nematode growth medium (NGM) petri plates. The plates were seeded 12 h prior to animal transfer so that the bacteria lawn was fresh and thin to obtain good quality contrast between animals and background. Microfluidic chip assay. Microfluidic devices were fabricated using standard SU-8 soft lithography techniques [62] in polydimethyl(siloxane). The design of the micropillar array is similar to that of Rahman et al., with a pillar diameter of 70 μm, gap of 90 μm and a chamber height of 110 μm. Animals were loaded inside the chip using a 1 mL syringe connected with a 0.032″ ID Tygon tubing (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) with a stainless-steel coupler tube (Instech Labs, FL). Synchronized animals in an NGM plate were flooded with liquid NGM and then transferred to an empty plate. Using a syringe, approximately 65 animals were aspirated from the plate and loaded inside the chip using the loading port. The chip was then flushed with liquid NGM, followed by an addition of 20 mg/mL E. coli OP50. Thrashing assay. Synchronized animals in an NGM plate were flooded with liquid NGM and then transferred to an empty plate. Three animals with 25 µL of liquid NGM were aspirated and transferred to each well of the glass slide (Tekdon Incorporated, Myakka City, FL, USA). Data analysis. To analyze the videos acquired from the plate and chip assay, we used the open-source software Image J with the plugin called wrMTrck. For the wildtype movies, thrashing data was also obtained using the wrMTrck plugin. For mutant thrashing assay, we played each movie and manually counted the thrashes. Each assay’s data were initially recorded in Microsoft Excel® (Version is 16.66.1) and then imported to GraphPad Prism software for visualization and statistical analysis. Types of statistical tests used in this study are included at the end of each figure caption.Author Contributions T.A. and S.A.V. designed the research. T.A. conducted the experiments.

    "abstract": "Significance Deteriorating health across the life course is a major societal burden, and effective therapeutics are lacking. Mitochondrial decline has long been associated with age-related health loss. We show that small, clinically meaningful doses of a mitochondrion-targeting sulfur donor (AP39) extend Caenorhabditis elegans health in older age, which act by maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Adult onset of AP39 delivery, when mitochondrial and cell structural dysfunction are already manifested, also promoted healthy aging. Distinct association of health span extension with mitochondria, cytoskeletal and peroxisome molecular profiles, under regulation of the elt-6/elt-3 transcription factor regulatory circuit, further distinguished adult-onset AP39 therapy. Our results establish a framework for forward translating mitochondrial sulfide as a potentially viable healthy aging intervention in mammals. Keywords: health span, longevity, mitochondria, transcriptomics, H2S",

    "methods": "Materials and Methods C. elegans Maintenance and Experiment Design. The strains used in this study were N2 wild-type and CB5600 (ccIs4251 (Pmyo-3::Ngfp-lacZ; Pmyo-3::Mtgfp)) and were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre (CGC, University of Minnesota). For maintenance, C. elegans were cultured at 20 °C on OP50 E. coli seeded NGM agar plates, as previously described (82). For all experiments, the first day of adulthood was considered as Day 0. For drug exposure experiments, unless stated otherwise, L1 worms synchronized by gravity floatation were cultured at 20 °C on OP50 E. coli seeded NGM plates containing either 100 nM AP39 + 0.01% DMSO, 100 nM or 100 mM NaGYY4137, 0.01% DMSO or no drug. The mitochondrion-targeted H2S donor compound, AP39, was synthesized in-house by the Whiteman lab, as previously described (83, 84). The NaGYY4137 (85) untargeted H2S donor compound was also synthesized in-house. Compound solutions were freshly prepared for every use and added to plates the evening before animal transfers. For developmental treatments, drug dosing was started from the L1 larval stage and continued throughout the life course. For adult drug treatments, gravity synchronized L1 larvae were grown on NGM agar seeded with OP50 only for 60 h to reach young adulthood, after which drug treatments were started at either day 0, day 2, or day 4 postadulthood. Adult animals were transferred every 48 h to fresh plates to remove progeny and maintain consistent food and drug concentrations. Survival Assay and Measures of C. elegans Locomotion and Maximal Strength Production. Adult animals were scored and transferred to fresh plates every 48 h. The animals were scored as dead when they failed to move in response to stimulus with a needle. Animals that were lost, killed during transfer, or died as a result of (e.g.) egg laying defects were censored. Total animal numbers were n = 300 per condition, across three biological replicates. Locomotion assays were performed using WMicrotracker and maximal strength production was assessed using the ‘NemaFlex’ microfluidic device (36) (See SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods). Mitochondrial and Myofibrillar Imaging. Mitochondria within body wall muscle cells of the CB5600 (ccIs4251 (Pmyo-3::Ngfp-lacZ; Pmyo-3::Mtgfp)) strain were imaged using an Olympus CKX41 microscope (Olympus UK Ltd. London). The worms were imaged by GFP fluorescence microscopy at 40× magnification. Approximately 20 to 30 animals per condition were placed in 20 µL M9 on a microscope slide and immobilized with a cover slip. Images were taken of myofibers or mitochondria in body-wall muscle from both head and tail regions of every animal and visually classified as either well-networked, moderately fragmented, or severely fragmented (for mitochondrial quantification), or organized, moderately disorganized, and severely disorganized (for myofibrillar quantification) as previously described (26, 86). The overall proportion of mitochondrial or myofibrillar classifications was obtained by normalizing to the total muscle cell count within each treatment condition (~150 to 300 muscle cells per condition from 30 to 60 animals per time point) across two biological replicates. Measurement of Citrate Synthase Activity. Wild-type N2 animals were roughly age synchronized as previously described and grown for ~60 h to young adulthood on fresh OP50 bacterial lawns 20 °C. Animals were transferred to fresh OP50 plates every 48 h to remove progeny and prevent population starvation, and 50 animals collected per condition, per time point (days 0, 2, 4, and 12 postadulthood) and per replicate. Citrate synthase activity (CS) was measured in isolated mitochondrial pellets, as described in Supplemental methods section. RNA Interference Protocols. All RNAi experiments were performed using age synchronized L1 larval stage animals by gravity flotation and grown for 60 h on NGM agar plates containing 1 mM IPTG, 50 µg/mL ampicillin. The plates were seeded with 200 μL HT115 (DE3) bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA against the genes screened. The Ahringer RNAi library (87) was utilized, purchased from Source Bioscience (Cambridge, UK). HT115 (DE3) bacteria containing the empty L4440 plasmid vector was used as controls. Full details of each RNAi protocol for health span/life span screens, or plate-based experiments can be viewed in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section. RNA Isolation for Next-Generation Sequencing. Synchronized worms were grown on NGM agar plates until young adulthood and treated with AP39 mtH2S from either L1 or day 0, as described above. On sample collection day, 100 worms were manually picked and added to 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent (Thermofisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) prior to RNA extractions (see SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section for details). RNA-seq Data Analyses. After RNA sequencing data preprocessing (see SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section), the DESeq2 package for R (88) was used to test for differential gene expression. Establishing approaches to adaptive shrinkage methods (89) and control for false discovery rate (FDR) were employed. DEGreport R was applied to normalized counts to group by expression profile any gene differentially regulated between treatments and/or time points. Functional enrichment analysis of defined gene clusters was then undertaken using the gprofiler2 package for R (90). Each gene cluster was also input into the Online Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING, v11.5; ref. 91) to infer respective PPI networks. Full details of the bioinformatic pipeline employed are provided in Supplemental methods section. 7-azido-4-Methylcoumarin Measures of Total Sulfide Levels. In all, 120 animals were picked into M9 buffer in 1.5 mL low-bind eppendorphs and washed three times with 1 mL sterile M9 to clear bacterial debris and progeny. Samples were snap-frozen in 40 µL M9 and stored at −80 °C until analysis (within 1 wk). Sulfide content was assessed as described previously (13, 86) as described in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section. ELT-6 Fluorescent Reporter Quantification. The SD1550 strain harboring an elt-6 fluorescent promoter and mitochondrial GFP (ccIs4251 [(pSAK2) myo-3p::GFP::LacZ::NLS + (pSAK4) myo-3p::mitochondrial GFP + dpy-20(+)] I. stIs10178 [elt-6p::HIS-24::mCherry + unc-119(+)] was imaged on an upright epifluorescent microscope (BX43, Olympus Life Science, UK). All elt-6 images were taken with mCherry fluorescence at 500-ms exposure and GFP fluorescence set to 50-ms exposure for mitochondrial images. Single images were taken from the head for ELT-6, as the sole site of ELT-6 reporter expression pattern, and from head and tail regions for mitochondrial characterisation across 40-60 animals per condition, per time point. Mitochondrial images were analyzed as detailed above, and ELT-6 images were quantified in ImageJ by performing integrated density quantification on each fluorescent image, subtracting background fluorescence. Mitochondrial Toxic Stress Assays in ELT-6 Transgenic Reporter Animals. Age-synchronized SD1550 animals were grown to young adulthood on 33-mm NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria. Approximately 30 day 0 adults where then picked into 40 μL of either 100 μM hydrogen peroxide (Sigma, UK; 7722-84-1) or 5 mM sodium arsenite (Santa Cruz, DE; 7784-46-5) diluted in M9 for 1- and 2-h exposures, respectively. For rotenone and antimycin A exposures, animals were picked into 40 μL 50 μM or 100 μM concentrations, respectively, diluted in 20 mg/mL OP50/NGM bacteria and incubated for 4 h. Tubes where then washed three times with M9 before animals were pipetted onto slides and immobilized by a coverslip. Both ELT-6 and mitochondrial images were then captured and analyzed as detailed above. Mitochondrial Superoxide Assessment. Superoxide levels were measured using MitoSOX (Invitrogen, UK) as described previously (86, 92). For day 0 measures, animals were grown on OP50 plates until L3 larval stage, where ~30 animals were then picked onto petri plates + OP50 seeded with a final plate concentration of 10 μM MitoSOX and left to incubate in the dark for 24 h. The same exposures were performed for day 4 and day 10 measures (i.e., day 3 and day 9 adults picked onto MitoSOX plates for 24 h, respectively). On the day of imaging, animals were washed from plates with M9 buffer into 1.5 mL low-bind tubes and washed three times to clear the outer cuticle of probe. Animals were then placed on OP50 plates for 1-h to clear residual probe from the gut. Animals were then picked into 20 μL M9 buffer on glass slides with glass coverslip. Images were taken with a 40× objective with green light excitation and a 1-s exposure rate. The terminal bulb was manually selected in ImageJ and integrated fluorescence density was normalized to the total area of analysis and background fluorescence removed. Statistics and Data Analysis. Statistics and graph generation were performed in GraphPad Prism 9. Significance was determined by paired t test or 2-way ANOVA, with post hoc multiple comparison tests. For survival analyses, the Log-Rank (Mantel Cox) test was used.",
    "results": "Results mtH2S Increases C. elegans Life span and Neuromuscular Health span. We first investigated the effects of mitochondrion-targeted and nontargeted H2S donors on C. elegans life span. Dosing L1 larvae with the untargeted sulfide donor NaGYY4137 (100 µM) increased maximal life span by 20 % (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1A), which is comparable to previous studies using GYY4137 (morpholine salt) and related compounds (18, 19). In sharp contrast, the mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecule (mtH2S) AP39 significantly increased life span at 1000-fold lower doses (100 nM) by 30% (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1B), whereas equivalent 100 nM doses of untargeted NaGYY4137 had no significant effect on C. elegans life span extension (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Lower doses of mitochondrion-targeted H2S extend life span. (A) C. elegans life span is significantly increased with higher (100 µM), but not lower (100 nM) treatment with the untargeted H2S donor, NaGYY4137 when administered from L1 larval stage across the entire lifecourse. (B) Conversely, lower doses (100 nM) of mitochondrion-targeted H2S (AP39) extend life span. Life span curves represent the average of three biological replicates (total ~300 to 600 animals per condition). **** denotes significant difference vs. untreated (0.01% DMSO) wild-type controls (P < 0.0001). ns, nonsignificant.We next assessed movement rates on days 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 of life span as a robust proxy of overall animal health (29–31) and, therefore, health span. Using wMicroTracker to measure prolonged movement capacity beyond standard thrash assays (32), wild-type movement capacity peaked at day 4 of adulthood (+97% vs. day 0 baseline), as previously published (33, 34), and progressively declined thereafter to a nadir of −26% at day 16 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). At greatly different doses, 100 µM NaGYY4137 H2S and 100 nM mtH2S increased total animal movement rates across the life course (P < 0.001), using area under the curve analysis of movement across the life course, as previously published (30) (Fig. 2A). Post hoc analysis showed significant health span extension in mtH2S (100 nM)-treated animals up to day 16 postadulthood compared to day 12 postadulthood during NaGYY4137 treatments (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Loss of neuromuscular strength is also one of the strongest correlates of all-cause mortality in humans (29, 35), leading us to employ our “NemaFlex” device (36–38) to examine neuromuscular strength changes across age. As with movement rates (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), wild-type strength capacity increased between days 0 and 4 adulthood and declined thereafter. Conversely, treatment with mtH2S (100 nM) improved strength production across days 0–10 postadulthood (P < 0.001), with a significant 20% strength increase vs. wild-type at day 10 (Fig. 2B). Additionally, while the observed effect sizes of mtH2S are comparable to those reported for other life span–extending compounds (39–41), the improvements we observed are modest. We, therefore, directly compared mtH2S to a recently published life span and health span improving drug, rilmenidine (42), using our microfluidic “Nemalife” health span device, and found both compounds extended life span and health span to similar degrees using our microfluidic approach (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Rilmendine also has no effect on neuromuscular health parameters in early life (42) but rather manifest in older age time points, as observed herein for mtH2S. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that H2S effects on health span are likely mediated through mitochondrial effects which, although modest, may be highly beneficial, since aging is also associated with a later life loss of prolonged movement and strength-producing capacity. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Mitochondrion-targeted H2S extends movement rate and maximal strength indices of health span. (A) Animal movement rate is increased across the entire lifecourse with both lower dose (100 nM) mitochondrion-targeted H2S (AP39) and higher dose (100 µM) untargeted H2S (NaGYY4137) when administered from L1 larval stage until death. Movement rates as a % change from day 0 baselines, across days 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 postadulthood, are presented as area under the curve. (B) Lower dose (100 nM) mitochondrion-targeted H2S maintains C. elegans maximal strength producing ability in later life (day 10 postadulthood), measured using our microfluidic NemaFlex device.

Given the well-established role of mitochondrial dysfunction in age-related health decline across species (25), we examined whether mtH2S health span promotion associated with maintained mitochondrial integrity. Using green fluorescent protein-tagged mitochondrion transgenic animals to compare lower dose mtH2S (100 nM) to higher dose untargeted H2S (100 µM), mitochondrial structure was scored as either well networked, or moderately fragmented. Well-networked mitochondria at day 0 of adulthood presented in 88% of wild-type animals, which was not affected by either mtH2S or untargeted H2S treatments. In line with previous reports (26), by day 2 postadulthood well-networked mitochondria reduced to 21% in wild-type worms. The number of well-networked mitochondria increased threefold with mtH2S treatment at day 2 of adulthood, and twofold with untargeted H2S (P < 0.001). Only mtH2S significantly sustained mitochondrial integrity at day 4 postadulthood (Fig. 3A). In wild-type animals, the number of moderately fragmented mitochondria increased progressively from day 2 of adulthood (21% of animals), reaching 86% by day 16. Comparable delays in moderate mitochondrial fragmentation were observed between mtH2S and untargeted H2S from days 8 to 12 postadulthood, whereas only mtH2S supressed moderate fragmentation up to day 14 of adulthood (Fig. 3B). We also assessed citrate synthase activity (CS) as a marker of mitochondrial health, which correlates with mitochondrial content, biosynthesis, and cristae area (43). Untargeted H2S failed to induce a significant effect on CS across the life course. Conversely, mtH2S significantly increased CS throughout life span, and to a greater extent than untargeted H2S (up to day 12, P < 0.0001), with significant increases in CS presenting up to day 4, but not day 12 of life span (Fig. 3E). To confirm that differences in H2S bioavailability does not underpin the improved efficacy of mtH2S vs. untargeted H2S for maintaining mitochondrial structure and content, we assessed total animal sulfide levels and found no difference with either compound at day 4 postadulthood (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Thus, mtH2S improves mitochondrial integrity across age, which associates with health span maintenance. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab mtH2S prolongs mitochondrial integrity and content. (A) The percentage of well-networked and (B) moderately fragmented mitochondria during C. elegans aging is significantly improved with mtH2S (AP39), and for a longer duration than untargeted H2S (NaGYY4137) treatments.

All data are mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 denote significant difference from untreated (0.01% DMSO) wild-type controls. AP39-Mediated Health span Extension Requires H2S Metabolism and FoxO Pathways, but Not Nrf2 Oxidative Stress Protection. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate longevity in response to exogenous H2S (19), yet the mechanisms governing health span extension are unknown. To probe this, we performed a hypothesis-driven RNAi gene knockdown and a mtH2S pharmacogenetic screen, using a microfluidic life span machine to assess animal health every day of the life course. First, we examined the requirement for enzymes controlling endogenous H2S synthesis: cytosolic cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS/cbs-1) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE/cth-2), and cytoplasmic/mitochondrial 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST/mpst-1) (8–10). Corroborating previous reports, we found that cth-2 knockdown alone had no effect on life span (19) and knocking down cbs-1 or mpst-1 shortened life span (19, 44) (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Knockdown of cth-2 also did not significantly affect health span, whereas knockdown of cbs-1 and mpst-1 RNAi both impaired health span (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Cotreatment of RNAi against cth-2, cbs-1 or mpst-1 with mtH2S from L1 stage prevented the positive effects of mtH2S on life span and health span (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). While exogenous mtH2S might be anticipated to bypass endogenous H2S biosynthesis pathways, analysis of total animal sulfide levels confirmed a need for functional H2S producing enzymes, since mtH2S-induced sulfide increases in older age were ablated when combined with cth-2, mpst-1 or cbs-1 RNAi (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Combined with the loss of mtH2S-induced life span and health span extension with knockdown of the H2S synthesizing enzymes kri-1 and cysl-2 (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4), the H2S synthesis system is a general requirement for the positive effects of mtH2S donors on C. elegans health and longevity.

Each experiment was performed in duplicate (total ~160 animals per condition) and health span data expressed as area under the curve (% movement rate of each day of the lifecourse vs. day 0 baseline values). Ticks denote RNAi knockdown prevents significant (P < 0.05) mtH2S life span or health span extension and compared to untreated (0.01% DMSO) empty vector controls. Crosses denote RNAi knockdown does not prevent significant (P < 0.05) mtH2S-induced life span or health span extension. All raw data are provided in SI Appendix, Fig. S4.We next examined the potential involvement of enzymes involved in wider H2S metabolism: ETHE1/ethe-1, a mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase necessary for H2S catabolism (45), and GSR/gsr-1, a glutathione reductase involved in H2S-mediated production of glutathione (46). Knockdown of ethe-1 alone did not affect life span but significantly increased health span and, when combined with mtH2S, prevented mtH2S-induced life span and health span extension. Because ethe-1 catabolizes H2S, we postulated that harmful H2S accumulation might occur following combined exogenous mtH2S administration. Examining the dose response (1nM to 2 µM) of mtH2S + ethe-1 knockdown revealed no further decline in animal health span, however life span became shortened at higher (100 nM to 2 µM) doses (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Both life span and health span were reduced following gsr-1 knockdown, which also inhibited life/health span extension with concurrent mtH2S treatment. Additionally, the FoxO/daf-16 transcription factor has been implicated in H2S life span extension (19), and we observed lowered life span and health span with daf-16 knockdown alone, corroborating previous reports (47). mtH2S did not increase life span or health span in animals subjected to daf-16 RNAi (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). H2S also regulated cellular redox homeostasis, in part through activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor and associated signaling pathway (48). We, therefore, knocked down Nrf2/skn-1 or DCAF11/wdr-23 as a negative upstream regulator of Nrf2 (49). In line with previous reports (50) skn-1 knockdown animals were short lived, whereas wdr-23 deficient worms were longer lived. Both skn-1 and wdr-23 RNAi also resulted in extended health span. Agreeing with earlier studies showing a need for the Nrf2 system for H2S-induced C. elegans life span extension (44), we also observed prevention of mtH2S increases in life span with combined skn-1 or wdr-23 knockdown. Despite this, our findings reveal that the Nrf2 system is not required for mtH2S-associated health span extension. We observed this same phenomenon with other components of the Nrf2 pathway, including the Nrf2-controlled glutamate–cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, GCLC/gcs-1. Only the Nrf2 nuclear translocation regulatory factor RelA/ikke-1 attenuated mtH2S health span improvements (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Our data strongly suggest that the positive health span effects of mtH2S were not dependent on the Nrf2 signaling system. Last, we investigated the role of two H2S-responsive candidates, the mitochondrion-located heat shock protein chaperone HSPA9/hsp-6 (44), and the hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF1A/ hif-1 (44). Knockdown of both hsp-6 or hif-1 significantly increased life span and health span, and combined gene knockdown with mtH2S did not impact the life span and health span promoting effects of mtH2S (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Adult Treatments with mtH2S Extend Health span, but Not Life span. Life span and health span extension have only been previously reported with untargeted H2S continuously administered from L1 larval stage until death. We, therefore, treated animals with low (100 nM) dose AP39 or 1000-fold higher (100 µM) dose NaGYY4137, starting in either day 0 young adults, day 2 of adulthood (chosen as the time point of mitochondrial fragmentation onset, Fig. 4A and ref. 26), or day 4 of adulthood [chosen as the time point when tissue structural integrity begins to decline (26)]. Both mtH2S and untargeted H2S donors were ineffective at increasing animal life span when administered from day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood (P > 0.05). Conversely, health span was significantly increased by mtH2S when administered from either day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood (P < 0.01) and was also increased with untargeted H2S treatments starting from days 2 or 4 postadulthood (P < 0.05), but not in day 0 young adults (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Additionally, mtH2S administered from day 0 adulthood significantly increased the number of normally arrayed mitochondria at days 4 and 10 postadulthood, and improved sarcomere organization at day 10 postadulthood (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). Providing further evidence that improved mitochondrial health underpins mtH2S health improvements, we also found significantly lower mitochondrial superoxide levels during aging with adult mtH2S treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). Health span was thus extended when mtH2S was delivered to adult animals, at time points where key aging subcellular defects occur, and is reflected in delayed onset of age-related dystrophic muscle and dysfunctional mitochondria. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Adult-onset treatment with mitochondrion-targeted H2S extends health span but not life span. (A–C) Survival curves are unaffected vs. wild-type (P > 0.05) with 100 nM mtH2S and 100 µM untargeted H2S treatments beginning at day 0, 2 or 4 of adulthood. (D–F) mtH2S significantly increases health span when administered from day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood, and untargeted H2S improves health span when administered from day 2 or 4 postadulthood.

Adult mtH2S Treatments Maintain Mitochondrion- and Peroxisome-Enriched Transcriptomes in Later Life. To better understand the molecules governing life span and health span responsiveness to mtH2S, we performed next-generation sequencing on animals treated with mtH2S from L1 larvae or from day 0 of adulthood. Principal component analysis revealed distinct features of C. elegans transcriptomes across days 0, 4, and 10 postadulthood. Moreover, mtH2S-treated animals displayed similar gene features to wild-type at day 0 and 4 of adulthood. Divergence from wild-type presented in older day 10 animals, with a shift toward day 4 features in mtH2S treatments, particularly when treated from day 0 young adulthood (Fig. 5A). Consistent with principal component analysis, global transcriptomic dysregulation at day 10 postadulthood was reduced in animals treated with mtH2S at adult onset only (Fig. 5B). Next, clustering of differentially expressed genes using expression profiles (51–53) identified four most prominent differentially expressed gene clusters (i.e., clusters containing >200 differentially expressed genes). Two of these (Clusters 8 and 14) exhibited an elevated expression profile in later life (day 10 postadulthood) that was suppressed with adult onset mtH2S but unaffected by mtH2S administered from birth (L1 stage), and were functionally associated with FoxO, proteolytic, mitophagy, and ribosome translational processes (Fig. 5 C and D). Analyzing the top 10 ranked protein–protein interaction (PPI) network hub nodes for each cluster identified daf-2-responsive F-box genes (fbxb-41, fbxb-54, fbxb-91, M116.1, pes-2.2, T05D4.2, T25E12.6) and autophagy (C35E7.5) components as prominent cluster 8 hubs. Cluster 14 hubs aligned almost exclusively to nucleolus localized components (lpd-7, nol-6, nol-14, pro-3, rpl-24.2) involved in RNA-binding activity as part of the ribonucleoprotein complex (F49D11.10, rbm-28, toe-1, W09C5.1, Y45F10D.7). As with wider cluster expression profiles, gene expression of hub components was predominantly altered at day 10 older age and in response to adult mtH2S treatments only (Fig. 5E). Fig. 5.

In both clusters, mtH2S administered from L1 again failed to affect the age-related loss of gene expression. Conversely, adult-onset mtH2S treatment induced a strong maintenance of gene expression, emerging specifically in day 10 adults (Fig. 5 C and D). Additionally, this pattern of age-related gene expression changes remaining unaltered by L1 mtH2S administration, but rejuvenated by adult-onset mtH2S in later life emerged across nearly all other 27 gene clusters identified (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig. S10). Top ranked hubs for cluster 3 related mostly to muscle cytoskeletal proteins (C46G7.2, cpn-3, mlc-1, mup-2, tnt-2, unc-27), but included regulators of calcium homeostasis (csq-1) and glutathione transferase activity (gst-26). Within cluster 13, there was striking enrichment for hubs functionally associated with peroxisomal components (acox-1.1, acox-1.2, B0272.4, ctl-2, daf-22, dhs-28) and lysosomal cathepsin proteases (asp-1, asp-3). Again, only adult-onset mtH2S treatments appeared to attenuate the age-related reduction in gene expression of hub components, in older day 10 animals (Fig. 5E). To probe the mechanistic influence of these hub genes in the positive aging effects of adult-onset mtH2S, we examined the requirement of the peroxisomal catalase ctl-2 as the most strongly maintained hub gene across clusters 3, 8, 13, and 14 (Fig. 5E). RNAi knockdown of ctl-2 exacerbated early adult mitochondrial fragmentation and prevented the mtH2S-induced mitochondrial maintainance in early and later life (SI Appendix, Fig. S11), therein supporting the functional and mechanistic relevance of our identified transcriptomic targets. A GATA Transcription Factor Regulatory Circuit Underpins the Positive Aging Effects of mtH2S. We next sought to examine the mechanistic role of genes responsive to mtH2S during aging; however, the clusters identified represent several dozen individual differentially expressed genes. We, therefore, employed transcription factor (TF)-binding site analysis to identify TFs predicted to commonly regulate the cytoskeletal (Cluster 3) and peroxisomal (Cluster 13) gene clusters that display mtH2S-induced preservation in older age. From this, a single transcription factor, elt-3 (part of a GATA family of transcription factors), emerged as the putative regulator of both gene clusters (Fig. 5D). During wild-type aging, expression of elt-5 and elt-6 increase which, in turn, repress expression of elt-3 to regulate a large portion of age-related transcriptome changes (54). Our untreated controls mirrored this response at the transcriptional level, and these expression changes are reversed by adult onset mtH2S (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). Next, using transgenic animals coexpressing ELT-6 RFP and mitochondrial GFP reporters, we confirmed protein level ELT-6 upregulation during aging, which was suppressed by adult onset mtH2S treatment (Fig. 6 A and B), and corresponded with improved mitochondrial structure and movement rates (Fig. 6 C and D). Additionally, knockdown of either elt-6 or elt-3, while not affecting animal movement rate in middle age and older age, prevented mtH2S-induced movement increases (Fig. 6 E and F). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Adult-onset mtH2S preserves health span through the ELT-6 GATA transcription factor circuit.

(D) AP39-induced improvements in aging movement capacity is confirmed in elt-6::mCherry + mito::GFP animals, and correspond with lowered ELT-6 and improved mitochondrial integrity. RNAi against elt-3 (E) and elt-6 (F) prevents the health span–promoting effects of AP39. Panels A–D employed transgenic animals coexpressing elt-6::mCherry + mito::GFP in body-wall muscle, across 25 to 45 animals and two biological repeats. Panels (E and F) employed wild-type N2 animals. Movement rates are from 80-120 animals per condition, per time point. # denote significant effect of aging compared to untreated day 0 animals (#P < 0.05; ###P < 0.001). * denote significant effect of treatment for within-day comparisons against untreated animals (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).To verify the role of elt-6/elt-3, we examined the cytoskeleton (adherens junction) and mitochondrion-localized protein BAR-1/ β-catenin, loss of which is reported to upr-egulate gene clusters under regulation by elt-3 (55) which would, therefore, be anticipated to also down-regulate ELT-6. Consistent with this model, we observed that bar-1 RNAi prevented age-related increases in ELT-6 expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). Moreover, mtH2S did not synergistically lower age-related ELT-6 levels when combined with bar-1 RNAi (SI Appendix, Fig. S13), implying some functional association with mtH2S and bar-1/β-catenin (further supporting a role for mtH2S in modifiying the cytoskeleton via the elt-6/elt-3 circuit). While the precise causal mechanisms linking H2S-related mitochondrial improvements with the elt-6/elt-3 system and, subsequently, health span remains undefined, the mitochondrial mechanisms appear specific to the aging context; although we show aging mitochondrial decline and mtH2S acts through this TF circtuit, inducing acute severe mitochondrial decline via toxic drugs fails to activate ELT-6 despite major structural fragmentation of mitochondria (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). Combined, our systems biological studies provide evidence that mtH2S improves mitochondrial health to alter elt-6/elt-3 TFs, which likely act as a reguatory circuit governing cytoskeletal and peroxisomal gene clusters to, ultimately, modify health span.",
    "discussion": "Discussion H2S is a diatomic signaling molecule that promotes healthy aging in C. elegans (20), yet the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic viability across the lifecourse remains unclear. In this study, we have demonstrated that low mtH2S doses extend C. elegans health span, which associates with improved mitochondrial integrity from young adulthood into older age. Multiple elements of H2S metabolic pathways, and FoxO transciption factors emerged as mechanisms governing both life span and health span, whereas the Nrf2 antioxidant system is dispensible for mtH2S-induced health span extension. Adult mtH2S treatments also increase health span, predominantly in later life, and associates with rejuvenation of key features of the aging transciptome, including mitochondrial function, cytoskeletal content, and peroxisomal metabolism, which appear to be controlled by a GATA transcription factor circuit. The ability of large amounts of untargeted H2S, administered from birth, to enhance C. elegans life span and health span, is well documented (17–20). Our data reveal 1000-fold lower doses of a mitochondrion-targeted (TPP+-driven) H2S donor (28) can account for the life span, health span, and neuromuscular strength extension elicited by H2S. Thus, small amounts of H2S transported to the mitochondria are likely responsible for, and the site of action of, H2S effects on longevity. Temporal analysis further revealed mtH2S improved mitochondrion integrity beginning in earlier life that was maintained throughout the lifecourse, thus delaying one of the primary cellular hallmarks of aging (25). Conversely, mtH2S did not increase movement rates or muscle strength until older age, likely owing to a lack of declines in muscle strength and habitual movement capacity during early adulthood, which is unsurprising, if decreasing H2S metabolism/synthesis is an aging pathology (56). These findings closely mirror the human phenotype, where a clear biphasic pattern of muscle aging emerges that involves early disruption to metabolic processes (57, 58) (as with C. elegans early loss of mitochondria integrity), which later manifests as exponential neuromuscular strength/ physical capacity declines (again, as occurs in C. elegans) that exceeds rates of musle mass losses (59, 60). As such, our data evidence that mtH2S can target the early mitochondrial metabolic perturbations during aging, possibly in preference over targeting respiratory function of existing mitochondria (61, 62) that attenuates the ensuing later changes in neuromuscular performance and health (25, 61, 62). While the mechanisms regulating H2S-induced longevity have been explored (19), understanding the molecules governing health span is at least equally valuable, given the growing societal burden of life span – health span dissociation. Of the fourteen genes targeted for established roles in H2S biology, two clear functional themes emerged as mechanisms of mtH2S life span and health span extension. First, the FoxO/daf-16 transcription factor is a highly conserved regulator of longevity across species (63) and in response to untargeted H2S (19). Our findings extend this to show daf-16 is also required for mtH2S-related health span improvements. Second, although exogenous H2S could hypothetically bypass the biochemical need for endogenous H2S synthesis, the H2S metabolism genes examined (most strikingly the mitochondria localized 3-MST/mpst-1) were required for health span extension by mtH2S. Moreover, mtH2S-induced sulfide increases were prevented by cth-2, mpst-1, or cbs-1 knockdown. Thus, while perhaps counterintuitive, presence of a functional H2S production system is a requirement for efficacious mtH2S treatments and might reflect the multifaceted cellular roles of the H2S enzymatic machinery and/or the diverse downstream consequences of loss of these enzymes (64). For example, H2S likely exerts at least part of its biological effects via cysteine persulfidation of multiple protein targets (65). The mitochondrially localized 3-MST/mpst-1 is also a trans-persulfidase (66), thus H2S enzyme knockdown could prevent mtH2S-mediated persulfidation events, through which H2S might partially act. Interestingly, despite fatal consqeuences of complete ETHE1 knockout in higher mammals (45), RNAi knockdown of the mitochondrial H2S catabolic enzyme ETHE1/ethe-1 strongly improved health span, possibly by mimicking mtH2S through mitochondrial accumulation of noncatabolized endogenous H2S. However, combined ethe-1 RNAi and mtH2S ablates health span extension, and life span becomes shortened at higher, but not lower (1 to 10 nM) mtH2S doses, potentially due to toxic mtH2S accumulation, implying tight physiological range of mtH2S hormesis. Overall, these mechanistic insights add further evidence that place mitochondria at the center of H2S-regulated health span. Activation of the Nrf2/skn-1 antioxidant system has also been reported to control H2S-based longevity in C. elegans (48). Oxidative stress and reactive oxidant species might be a secondary consequence of tissue aging that may exacerbate, rather than cause aging health decline (67–70). While corroborating the requirement of the Nrf2 pathway for H2S life span extension, multiple components of the Nrf2/skn-1 system, including the upstream activator DACF11/wdr-23 and downstream effector GCLC/gcs-1, were not required for mtH2S health span improvements. Knocking down KRIT1/kri-1, which activates Nrf2 through redox species generation (44), did prevent mtH2S-induced health span extension. However, since several Nrf2 system components are not mechanisms of mtH2S health span extension, KRIT1/kri-1 health span regulation likely relies on its alternate functions in H2S synthesis (44). Importantly, these results highlight clear dissociation between the fundamental mechanisms governing life span vs. health span, indicating that oxidative stress protection pathways are dispensable for mtH2S-extended health span, but not life span. The potential for developmentally programmed metabolic patterns with larval H2S treatments (21–23) renders the efficacy of postadulthood H2S therapies uncertain. We establish health span alone is extended with young adult mtH2S treatments, and when initiated in the presence of existing aging tissue pathologies. We, and others (26), found that mitochondrial fragmentation begins early in life (2 days postadulthood), and in this study we report that mtH2S improves health span when administered at this time. Similarly, muscle structural and proteostasis abnormalities occur later (4 days postadulthood), and mtH2S also displays efficacy during this therapeutic window. Mitochondrial H2S is, therefore, a viable adult-onset antiaging therapeutic opportunity. Transcriptomic studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms regulating adult mtH2S health span extension revealed clear distinctions from larval treatments. Whilet administering mtH2S from L1 stage caused broad transcriptional features that diverged only slightly from wild-type animals only in older age, adult-onset mtH2S caused strong rejuvenation of the aging transcriptome toward “younger” gene profiles. Cluster analysis revealed adult mtH2S suppressed aging-induced increases in FoxO/daf-16 pathway expression. Whilet contrasting our observation that daf-16 is a required effector of larval mtH2S treatment, suppression of aging daf-16 levels with adult mtH2S implies divergent effects of FoxO induction during development vs. postdevelopment (71). This is consistent with earlier reports that longevity caused by up-regulating FoxO/daf-16 (via insulin receptor/daf-2 mutation) is primarily established during larval development (72). Conversely, sarcopenia associates with postdevelopmental FoxO upregulation across species (58), corresponding with later life metabolic reprogramming to compensate for aging health decline (57, 58). Consistent with a potential beneficial aging effect of reduced postadulthood FoxO expression, are the moderate health span improvements we report with mtH2S-related daf-16 suppression. This phenomenon underscores an unexplained paradox in aging research, whereby developmentally programmed life span extension (e.g., with increased FoxO signaling) presents at the expense of health span (7). Indeed, in people, FoxO genetic variants correlate with centenarians (73), yet impaired insulin signaling/ increased FoxO induced during adulthood causes serious clinical complications (e.g., diabetes, sarcopenia). Our data support a model whereby postdevelopmental, aging-induced increases in FoxO expression are harmful to health span (71), and drug interventions such as mtH2S that lower this response improve health whilet having minimal effect on longevity. Last, adult mtH2S also caused suppression of age-related increases in mitophagy and, most prominently, ribosomal biogenesis. Thus, mtH2S might mitigate unchecked mitophagy by preventing the mitochondrial dysfunction that promotes mitophagy with age (74), and promote improved translational efficiency as previously proposed to underpin physical activity-based anti-aging regimens (75, 76). Adult mtH2S treatment also better maintained later-life expression of lowered aging transcriptomic profiles. Genes clustering to mitochondrion function featured heavily, lending further support to the central role of mitochondria in mtH2S-mediated health span. Expression of muscle cytoskeletal components also decreased with age, which was minimized by adult mtH2S administration, with top ranked hub components largely represented by cytoskeletal (e.g., troponin regulation) factors. Given the later life temporal correlation between increased muscle structural genes and movement/strength capacity, mtH2S represents a promising neuromuscular health intervention in older age. Last, loss of metabolic plasticity is a common feature of aging across species (25). We found progressive reduction in expression of metabolic functional clusters across aging that was increased with adult onset mtH2S. Notably, metabolic cluster hub genes were strongly enriched for peroxisomal components. Peroxisomes are essential for proper functioning of all cell types, compartmentalizing enzymes regulating, e.g., fatty acid β-oxidation and hydrogen peroxide metabolism. Several facets of peroxisome dysfunction cause accelerated aging (77), and our data suggest peroxisome function can be sustained by mtH2S across life span. For example, dhs-28 regulates age-dependent peroxisome loss, knockdown of which extends C. elegans life span (78), and our findings identify dhs-28 as a top ranked, mtH2S-responsive hub component. Moreover, we confirm the mechanistic relevance of our identified peroxisomal transcriptomic targets by showing knockdown of the ctl-2 hub gene prevents mtH2S-induced health span extension. Growing evidence also highlights inextricable cross talk between peroxisome and mitochondrial function (79). Indeed, caloric restriction–induced longevity [whose mechanisms converge with those of H2S (80)], requires mitochondria structural maintenance which, in turn, promotes peroxisome fatty acid oxidation (81). Our early-life improvements in mitochondrial integrity, combined with mitochondria localizing H2S, demonstrate improvements in mitochondrial integrity precede, and perhaps regulate, later life improvements in peroxisome capacity. Additionally, the lack of mechanistic regulation of health span by the Nrf2 antioxidant system implies that improved peroxisome fatty acid oxidation, as opposed to lowered reactive oxygen species generation, underpin peroxisomal effects of mtH2S on healthy aging. Transcription factor-binding site analysis of our transcriptomic data identified the GATA TF circuit elt-6/elt-3 as putatively regulating the health span benefits of adult onset mtH2S, which were subsequently verified by our mechanistic experiments. Previous work established age-related elt-6 upregulation and downstream repression of elt-3, which accounted for altered expression of ~1,300 “aging” genes (54), which might comprise an evolutionarily conserved element of natural aging adaptation that promotes longevity, perhaps at the expense of health span, similarly to FoxO. Here, we confirm the relevance of this aging TF axis and establish elt-6/elt-3 as mechanisms through which mtH2S and, either interrelatedly or independently via bar-1/ β-catenin, act to affect aging health. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction per se is insufficient to explain elt-6 upregulation, since severe toxin-induced mitochondrial insults fail to induce ELT-6. Thus, some as yet unknown specificity to age-related mitochondrial decline alters the elt-6 pathway to induce gene expression changes that impair health span. Regardless, our combined functional, morphologic, transcriptomic, and mechanistic results point to a model where aging mitcohondrial decline activates GATA TFs to alter gene expression, centered on cytoskeletal and peroxisomal gene clusters, to impair animal health. Crucially, mtH2S is an efficacious therapeutic approach for targeting the mitochondria to reverse this aging signaling axis and, ultimately, improve health span. In conclusion, a systems biological approach identifies the mitochondria as the primary site of H2S action for slowing aging, with distinct molecular mechanisms underpinning life span vs. health span extension. Unlike life span, increased mtH2S health span does not require activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant system. Adult-onset mtH2S also increases health span alone, which associates with unique aging transcriptomic signatures compared to life span–extending developmental mtH2S treatments, under the control of elt-6/elt-3 GATA transcription factors. The emergence of neuromuscular health improvements in later life might also be underpinned by temporally correlated, mtH2S-responsive transcriptomic features of mitochondria, peroxisomal metabolism, and cytoskeletal function. Finally, the comparably lower mtH2S donor doses (vs. nontargeted NaGYY4137; >3 orders of magnitude difference) required for aging health benefits, combined with efficacy in adult animals and high conservation of associated mechanisms, renders mtH2S a possible translational antiaging therapy.",

Copyright notice ID: 10410709 PMID: 37523525 Significance Deteriorating health across the life course is a major societal burden, and effective therapeutics are lacking. Mitochondrial decline has long been associated with age-related health loss. We show that small, clinically meaningful doses of a mitochondrion-targeting sulfur donor (AP39) extend Caenorhabditis elegans health in older age, which act by maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Adult onset of AP39 delivery, when mitochondrial and cell structural dysfunction are already manifested, also promoted healthy aging. Distinct association of health span extension with mitochondria, cytoskeletal and peroxisome molecular profiles, under regulation of the elt-6/elt-3 transcription factor regulatory circuit, further distinguished adult-onset AP39 therapy. Our results establish a framework for forward translating mitochondrial sulfide as a potentially viable healthy aging intervention in mammals. Keywords: health span, longevity, mitochondria, transcriptomics, H2SAbstract Living longer without simultaneously extending years spent in good health (“health span”) is an increasing societal burden, demanding new therapeutic strategies. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can correct disease-related mitochondrial metabolic deficiencies, and supraphysiological H2S concentrations can pro health span. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecules (mtH2S) administered across the adult life course are unknown. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans aging model, we compared untargeted H2S (NaGYY4137, 100 µM and 100 nM) and mtH2S (AP39, 100 nM) donor effects on life span, neuromuscular health span, and mitochondrial integrity. H2S donors were administered from birth or in young/middle-aged animals (day 0, 2, or 4 postadulthood). RNAi pharmacogenetic interventions and transcriptomics/network analysis explored molecular events governing mtH2S donor-mediated health span. Developmentally administered mtH2S (100 nM) improved life/health span vs. equivalent untargeted H2S doses. mtH2S preserved aging mitochondrial structure, content (citrate synthase activity) and neuromuscular strength. Knockdown of H2S metabolism enzymes and FoxO/daf-16 prevented the positive health span effects of mtH2S, whereas DCAF11/wdr-23 – Nrf2/skn-1 oxidative stress protection pathways were dispensable. Health span, but not life span, increased with all adult-onset mtH2S treatments. Adult mtH2S treatment also rejuvenated aging transcriptomes by minimizing expression declines of mitochondria and cytoskeletal components, and peroxisome metabolism hub components, under mechanistic control by the elt-6/elt-3 transcription factor circuit. H2S health span extension likely acts at the mitochondrial level, the mechanisms of which dissociate from life span across adult vs. developmental treatment timings. The small mtH2S doses required for health span extension, combined with efficacy in adult animals, suggest mtH2S is a potential healthy aging therapeutic. Medical advances mean humans are living longer but are also spending longer in a frail “poor health” state (1, 2), with large burdens on healthcare systems and quality of life (3). Since most age-related healthcare costs and patient frailty occur in the later years of life (1, 2), interventions that increase life span without simultaneously increasing health span would be detrimental to the aging process. Studies often report life span–extending therapeutics in lower organisms (4, 5), but a significant caveat is the general assumption that increasing longevity also prolongs the duration spent in a healthy state (termed “health span”). While it is largely unknown whether most conditions that extend life span also increase health span, evidence indicates dissociation between the two (6). For example, all long-lived Caenorhabditis elegans mutants examined to date spend a longer time in an aged frail condition (7); the same phenomenon reported in long-living humans (1, 2). Therapeutic approaches that extend healthy years, rather than life span alone, thus hold considerable socioeconomic potential. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was one of the essential ingredients required for life to emerge on Earth (8, 9) and has emerged as an important, physiologically relevant signaling molecule. When applied exogenously, H2S treatments, usually in the form of crude impure sulfide salts at supraphysiological concentrations (e.g. >100 µM), confer cytoprotective properties across various pathophysiological states (9–14), including age-associated diseases (15, 16). Accordingly, 100 to 150 µM concentrations of untargeted H2S donors such as GYY4137 and FW1256 extend both life span (17–19) and health span (20) in C. elegans when administered from birth. However, several essential biochemical processes are established during development that program subsequent adult behavior. For example, developmental starvation cements locomotion circuitry that impacts adult foraging behavior (21), and developmentally established mitochondrial dynamics determine rates of adult respiration and aging (22). Additionally, life-extending mitochondrial interventions in C. elegans currently require administration on or before the developmental larval stages (23). Metabolic patterns set during developmental H2S treatments might, therefore, mediate life span and health span extension. The efficacy of H2S administered during “normal” stochastic aging thus warrants investigation to understand the viability of adult H2S-based therapies. Several cellular processes are responsive to H2S that can regulate H2S-mediated longevity (18), yet the mechanisms governing H2S-mediated health span are undefined. Increasing evidence supports a mitochondrion-centric mode of H2S action across cell types and pathologies. Current dogma suggests H2S donates electrons to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, inhibits mitochondrial cAMP phosphodiesterases, facilitates mitochondrial DNA repair, promotes mitochondrial antioxidant protection, and augments mitochondrial respiration/ATP production (reviewed in ref. 24). Moreover, mitochondrial loss is one of the nine hallmarks of aging (25) and is the earliest detectable subcellular structural change during C. elegans aging (26), preceding physiological decline (27). As such, therapies that exploit positive H2S effects on mitochondria represent an attractive antiaging strategy. The mitochondrial sulfide delivery molecule (mtH2S), AP39, exploits mitochondrial membrane potential by utilizing a TPP+ motif to localize H2S to the mitochondria and protect against cellular injury [e.g., glucose oxidase–induced mitochondrial dysfunction (28)] vs. equal doses of untargeted H2S donors. Consequently, unlike untargeted H2S compounds (e.g., GYY4137, FW1256) with supraphysiological effective doses (17–20), mtH2S displays potency at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower in C. elegans disease models (13, 14). Whether such phenomena occur in the aging context is unknown; however, mtH2S is plausibly responsible for longevity and health span extension reported following larger untargeted H2S doses. This study, therefore, investigated the efficacy of a mtH2S (AP39) for promoting health span via mitochondrion-mediated effects vs. untargeted H2S donors, using C. elegans as an aging model. Given the unknown capacity of H2S as an efficacious therapy in aging adults, we also examined health span effects of adult-onset H2S treatments. Using functional pharmacogenetic approaches, we provide evidence that mtH2S is a requirement for, and site of action of, H2S-mediated health span promotion. Importantly, mtH2S increases health span when administered to young and middle-aged adults, and this adult treatment effect is clearly reflected at the transcriptomic level compared to developmental mtH2S administration, under the control of a GATA family of transcription factors. These findings strongly suggest that augmentation of mitochondrial sulfide may represent a druggable target and translatable therapeutic approach to maintaining health with advancing age, at time points where the negative effects of aging already manifest. Results mtH2S Increases C. elegans Life span and Neuromuscular Health span. We first investigated the effects of mitochondrion-targeted and nontargeted H2S donors on C. elegans life span. Dosing L1 larvae with the untargeted sulfide donor NaGYY4137 (100 µM) increased maximal life span by 20 % (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1A), which is comparable to previous studies using GYY4137 (morpholine salt) and related compounds (18, 19). In sharp contrast, the mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecule (mtH2S) AP39 significantly increased life span at 1000-fold lower doses (100 nM) by 30% (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1B), whereas equivalent 100 nM doses of untargeted NaGYY4137 had no significant effect on C. elegans life span extension (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Lower doses of mitochondrion-targeted H2S extend life span. (A) C. elegans life span is significantly increased with higher (100 µM), but not lower (100 nM) treatment with the untargeted H2S donor, NaGYY4137 when administered from L1 larval stage across the entire lifecourse. (B) Conversely, lower doses (100 nM) of mitochondrion-targeted H2S (AP39) extend life span. Life span curves represent the average of three biological replicates (total ~300 to 600 animals per condition). **** denotes significant difference vs. untreated (0.01% DMSO) wild-type controls (P < 0.0001). ns, nonsignificant.We next assessed movement rates on days 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 of life span as a robust proxy of overall animal health (29–31) and, therefore, health span. Using wMicroTracker to measure prolonged movement capacity beyond standard thrash assays (32), wild-type movement capacity peaked at day 4 of adulthood (+97% vs. day 0 baseline), as previously published (33, 34), and progressively declined thereafter to a nadir of −26% at day 16 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). At greatly different doses, 100 µM NaGYY4137 H2S and 100 nM mtH2S increased total animal movement rates across the life course (P < 0.001), using area under the curve analysis of movement across the life course, as previously published (30) (Fig. 2A). Post hoc analysis showed significant health span extension in mtH2S (100 nM)-treated animals up to day 16 postadulthood compared to day 12 postadulthood during NaGYY4137 treatments (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Loss of neuromuscular strength is also one of the strongest correlates of all-cause mortality in humans (29, 35), leading us to employ our “NemaFlex” device (36–38) to examine neuromuscular strength changes across age. As with movement rates (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), wild-type strength capacity increased between days 0 and 4 adulthood and declined thereafter. Conversely, treatment with mtH2S (100 nM) improved strength production across days 0–10 postadulthood (P < 0.001), with a significant 20% strength increase vs. wild-type at day 10 (Fig. 2B). Additionally, while the observed effect sizes of mtH2S are comparable to those reported for other life span–extending compounds (39–41), the improvements we observed are modest. We, therefore, directly compared mtH2S to a recently published life span and health span improving drug, rilmenidine (42), using our microfluidic “Nemalife” health span device, and found both compounds extended life span and health span to similar degrees using our microfluidic approach (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Rilmendine also has no effect on neuromuscular health parameters in early life (42) but rather manifest in older age time points, as observed herein for mtH2S. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that H2S effects on health span are likely mediated through mitochondrial effects which, although modest, may be highly beneficial, since aging is also associated with a later life loss of prolonged movement and strength-producing capacity. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Mitochondrion-targeted H2S extends movement rate and maximal strength indices of health span. (A) Animal movement rate is increased across the entire lifecourse with both lower dose (100 nM) mitochondrion-targeted H2S (AP39) and higher dose (100 µM) untargeted H2S (NaGYY4137) when administered from L1 larval stage until death. Movement rates as a % change from day 0 baselines, across days 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 postadulthood, are presented as area under the curve. (B) Lower dose (100 nM) mitochondrion-targeted H2S maintains C. elegans maximal strength producing ability in later life (day 10 postadulthood), measured using our microfluidic NemaFlex device.

Given the well-established role of mitochondrial dysfunction in age-related health decline across species (25), we examined whether mtH2S health span promotion associated with maintained mitochondrial integrity. Using green fluorescent protein-tagged mitochondrion transgenic animals to compare lower dose mtH2S (100 nM) to higher dose untargeted H2S (100 µM), mitochondrial structure was scored as either well networked, or moderately fragmented. Well-networked mitochondria at day 0 of adulthood presented in 88% of wild-type animals, which was not affected by either mtH2S or untargeted H2S treatments. In line with previous reports (26), by day 2 postadulthood well-networked mitochondria reduced to 21% in wild-type worms. The number of well-networked mitochondria increased threefold with mtH2S treatment at day 2 of adulthood, and twofold with untargeted H2S (P < 0.001). Only mtH2S significantly sustained mitochondrial integrity at day 4 postadulthood (Fig. 3A). In wild-type animals, the number of moderately fragmented mitochondria increased progressively from day 2 of adulthood (21% of animals), reaching 86% by day 16. Comparable delays in moderate mitochondrial fragmentation were observed between mtH2S and untargeted H2S from days 8 to 12 postadulthood, whereas only mtH2S supressed moderate fragmentation up to day 14 of adulthood (Fig. 3B). We also assessed citrate synthase activity (CS) as a marker of mitochondrial health, which correlates with mitochondrial content, biosynthesis, and cristae area (43). Untargeted H2S failed to induce a significant effect on CS across the life course. Conversely, mtH2S significantly increased CS throughout life span, and to a greater extent than untargeted H2S (up to day 12, P < 0.0001), with significant increases in CS presenting up to day 4, but not day 12 of life span (Fig. 3E). To confirm that differences in H2S bioavailability does not underpin the improved efficacy of mtH2S vs. untargeted H2S for maintaining mitochondrial structure and content, we assessed total animal sulfide levels and found no difference with either compound at day 4 postadulthood (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Thus, mtH2S improves mitochondrial integrity across age, which associates with health span maintenance. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab mtH2S prolongs mitochondrial integrity and content.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate longevity in response to exogenous H2S (19), yet the mechanisms governing health span extension are unknown. To probe this, we performed a hypothesis-driven RNAi gene knockdown and a mtH2S pharmacogenetic screen, using a microfluidic life span machine to assess animal health every day of the life course. First, we examined the requirement for enzymes controlling endogenous H2S synthesis: cytosolic cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS/cbs-1) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE/cth-2), and cytoplasmic/mitochondrial 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST/mpst-1) (8–10). Corroborating previous reports, we found that cth-2 knockdown alone had no effect on life span (19) and knocking down cbs-1 or mpst-1 shortened life span (19, 44) (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Knockdown of cth-2 also did not significantly affect health span, whereas knockdown of cbs-1 and mpst-1 RNAi both impaired health span (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Cotreatment of RNAi against cth-2, cbs-1 or mpst-1 with mtH2S from L1 stage prevented the positive effects of mtH2S on life span and health span (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). While exogenous mtH2S might be anticipated to bypass endogenous H2S biosynthesis pathways, analysis of total animal sulfide levels confirmed a need for functional H2S producing enzymes, since mtH2S-induced sulfide increases in older age were ablated when combined with cth-2, mpst-1 or cbs-1 RNAi (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Combined with the loss of mtH2S-induced life span and health span extension with knockdown of the H2S synthesizing enzymes kri-1 and cysl-2 (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4), the H2S synthesis system is a general requirement for the positive effects of mtH2S donors on C. elegans health and longevity.

Each experiment was performed in duplicate (total ~160 animals per condition) and health span data expressed as area under the curve (% movement rate of each day of the lifecourse vs. day 0 baseline values). Ticks denote RNAi knockdown prevents significant (P < 0.05) mtH2S life span or health span extension and compared to untreated (0.01% DMSO) empty vector controls. Crosses denote RNAi knockdown does not prevent significant (P < 0.05) mtH2S-induced life span or health span extension. All raw data are provided in SI Appendix, Fig. S4.We next examined the potential involvement of enzymes involved in wider H2S metabolism: ETHE1/ethe-1, a mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase necessary for H2S catabolism (45), and GSR/gsr-1, a glutathione reductase involved in H2S-mediated production of glutathione (46). Knockdown of ethe-1 alone did not affect life span but significantly increased health span and, when combined with mtH2S, prevented mtH2S-induced life span and health span extension. Because ethe-1 catabolizes H2S, we postulated that harmful H2S accumulation might occur following combined exogenous mtH2S administration. Examining the dose response (1nM to 2 µM) of mtH2S + ethe-1 knockdown revealed no further decline in animal health span, however life span became shortened at higher (100 nM to 2 µM) doses (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Both life span and health span were reduced following gsr-1 knockdown, which also inhibited life/health span extension with concurrent mtH2S treatment. Additionally, the FoxO/daf-16 transcription factor has been implicated in H2S life span extension (19), and we observed lowered life span and health span with daf-16 knockdown alone, corroborating previous reports (47). mtH2S did not increase life span or health span in animals subjected to daf-16 RNAi (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). H2S also regulated cellular redox homeostasis, in part through activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor and associated signaling pathway (48). We, therefore, knocked down Nrf2/skn-1 or DCAF11/wdr-23 as a negative upstream regulator of Nrf2 (49). In line with previous reports (50) skn-1 knockdown animals were short lived, whereas wdr-23 deficient worms were longer lived. Both skn-1 and wdr-23 RNAi also resulted in extended health span. Agreeing with earlier studies showing a need for the Nrf2 system for H2S-induced C. elegans life span extension (44), we also observed prevention of mtH2S increases in life span with combined skn-1 or wdr-23 knockdown. Despite this, our findings reveal that the Nrf2 system is not required for mtH2S-associated health span extension. We observed this same phenomenon with other components of the Nrf2 pathway, including the Nrf2-controlled glutamate–cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, GCLC/gcs-1. Only the Nrf2 nuclear translocation regulatory factor RelA/ikke-1 attenuated mtH2S health span improvements (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Our data strongly suggest that the positive health span effects of mtH2S were not dependent on the Nrf2 signaling system. Last, we investigated the role of two H2S-responsive candidates, the mitochondrion-located heat shock protein chaperone HSPA9/hsp-6 (44), and the hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF1A/ hif-1 (44). Knockdown of both hsp-6 or hif-1 significantly increased life span and health span, and combined gene knockdown with mtH2S did not impact the life span and health span promoting effects of mtH2S (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4).Adult Treatments with mtH2S Extend Health span, but Not Life span. Life span and health span extension have only been previously reported with untargeted H2S continuously administered from L1 larval stage until death. We, therefore, treated animals with low (100 nM) dose AP39 or 1000-fold higher (100 µM) dose NaGYY4137, starting in either day 0 young adults, day 2 of adulthood (chosen as the time point of mitochondrial fragmentation onset, Fig. 4A and ref. 26), or day 4 of adulthood [chosen as the time point when tissue structural integrity begins to decline (26)]. Both mtH2S and untargeted H2S donors were ineffective at increasing animal life span when administered from day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood (P > 0.05). Conversely, health span was significantly increased by mtH2S when administered from either day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood (P < 0.01) and was also increased with untargeted H2S treatments starting from days 2 or 4 postadulthood (P < 0.05), but not in day 0 young adults (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Additionally, mtH2S administered from day 0 adulthood significantly increased the number of normally arrayed mitochondria at days 4 and 10 postadulthood, and improved sarcomere organization at day 10 postadulthood (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). Providing further evidence that improved mitochondrial health underpins mtH2S health improvements, we also found significantly lower mitochondrial superoxide levels during aging with adult mtH2S treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). Health span was thus extended when mtH2S was delivered to adult animals, at time points where key aging subcellular defects occur, and is reflected in delayed onset of age-related dystrophic muscle and dysfunctional mitochondria. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Adult-onset treatment with mitochondrion-targeted H2S extends health span but not life span. (A–C) Survival curves are unaffected vs. wild-type (P > 0.05) with 100 nM mtH2S and 100 µM untargeted H2S treatments beginning at day 0, 2 or 4 of adulthood. (D–F) mtH2S significantly increases health span when administered from day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood, and untargeted H2S improves health span when administered from day 2 or 4 postadulthood.

To better understand the molecules governing life span and health span responsiveness to mtH2S, we performed next-generation sequencing on animals treated with mtH2S from L1 larvae or from day 0 of adulthood. Principal component analysis revealed distinct features of C. elegans transcriptomes across days 0, 4, and 10 postadulthood. Moreover, mtH2S-treated animals displayed similar gene features to wild-type at day 0 and 4 of adulthood. Divergence from wild-type presented in older day 10 animals, with a shift toward day 4 features in mtH2S treatments, particularly when treated from day 0 young adulthood (Fig. 5A). Consistent with principal component analysis, global transcriptomic dysregulation at day 10 postadulthood was reduced in animals treated with mtH2S at adult onset only (Fig. 5B). Next, clustering of differentially expressed genes using expression profiles (51–53) identified four most prominent differentially expressed gene clusters (i.e., clusters containing >200 differentially expressed genes). Two of these (Clusters 8 and 14) exhibited an elevated expression profile in later life (day 10 postadulthood) that was suppressed with adult onset mtH2S but unaffected by mtH2S administered from birth (L1 stage), and were functionally associated with FoxO, proteolytic, mitophagy, and ribosome translational processes (Fig. 5 C and D). Analyzing the top 10 ranked protein–protein interaction (PPI) network hub nodes for each cluster identified daf-2-responsive F-box genes (fbxb-41, fbxb-54, fbxb-91, M116.1, pes-2.2, T05D4.2, T25E12.6) and autophagy (C35E7.5) components as prominent cluster 8 hubs. Cluster 14 hubs aligned almost exclusively to nucleolus localized components (lpd-7, nol-6, nol-14, pro-3, rpl-24.2) involved in RNA-binding activity as part of the ribonucleoprotein complex (F49D11.10, rbm-28, toe-1, W09C5.1, Y45F10D.7). As with wider cluster expression profiles, gene expression of hub components was predominantly altered at day 10 older age and in response to adult mtH2S treatments only (Fig. 5E). Fig. 5.

In both clusters, mtH2S administered from L1 again failed to affect the age-related loss of gene expression. Conversely, adult-onset mtH2S treatment induced a strong maintenance of gene expression, emerging specifically in day 10 adults (Fig. 5 C and D). Additionally, this pattern of age-related gene expression changes remaining unaltered by L1 mtH2S administration, but rejuvenated by adult-onset mtH2S in later life emerged across nearly all other 27 gene clusters identified (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig. S10). Top ranked hubs for cluster 3 related mostly to muscle cytoskeletal proteins (C46G7.2, cpn-3, mlc-1, mup-2, tnt-2, unc-27), but included regulators of calcium homeostasis (csq-1) and glutathione transferase activity (gst-26). Within cluster 13, there was striking enrichment for hubs functionally associated with peroxisomal components (acox-1.1, acox-1.2, B0272.4, ctl-2, daf-22, dhs-28) and lysosomal cathepsin proteases (asp-1, asp-3). Again, only adult-onset mtH2S treatments appeared to attenuate the age-related reduction in gene expression of hub components, in older day 10 animals (Fig. 5E). To probe the mechanistic influence of these hub genes in the positive aging effects of adult-onset mtH2S, we examined the requirement of the peroxisomal catalase ctl-2 as the most strongly maintained hub gene across clusters 3, 8, 13, and 14 (Fig. 5E). RNAi knockdown of ctl-2 exacerbated early adult mitochondrial fragmentation and prevented the mtH2S-induced mitochondrial maintainance in early and later life (SI Appendix, Fig. S11), therein supporting the functional and mechanistic relevance of our identified transcriptomic targets.A GATA Transcription Factor Regulatory Circuit Underpins the Positive Aging Effects of mtH2S. We next sought to examine the mechanistic role of genes responsive to mtH2S during aging; however, the clusters identified represent several dozen individual differentially expressed genes. We, therefore, employed transcription factor (TF)-binding site analysis to identify TFs predicted to commonly regulate the cytoskeletal (Cluster 3) and peroxisomal (Cluster 13) gene clusters that display mtH2S-induced preservation in older age. From this, a single transcription factor, elt-3 (part of a GATA family of transcription factors), emerged as the putative regulator of both gene clusters (Fig. 5D). During wild-type aging, expression of elt-5 and elt-6 increase which, in turn, repress expression of elt-3 to regulate a large portion of age-related transcriptome changes (54). Our untreated controls mirrored this response at the transcriptional level, and these expression changes are reversed by adult onset mtH2S (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). Next, using transgenic animals coexpressing ELT-6 RFP and mitochondrial GFP reporters, we confirmed protein level ELT-6 upregulation during aging, which was suppressed by adult onset mtH2S treatment (Fig. 6 A and B), and corresponded with improved mitochondrial structure and movement rates (Fig. 6 C and D). Additionally, knockdown of either elt-6 or elt-3, while not affecting animal movement rate in middle age and older age, prevented mtH2S-induced movement increases (Fig. 6 E and F). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Adult-onset mtH2S preserves health span through the ELT-6 GATA transcription factor circuit. (A) ELT-6 expression increases with aging and is significantly repressed with AP39 treatment compared to untreated animals in later-life. (B) Representative images of ELT-6 expression (elt-6::mCherry). (C) Preservation of age-related declines in mitochondrial integrity by AP39 correspond with attenuated ELT-6 expression (using elt-6::mCherry + mito::GFP coexpression reporter strain). (D) AP39-induced improvements in aging movement capacity is confirmed in elt-6::mCherry + mito::GFP animals, and correspond with lowered ELT-6 and improved mitochondrial integrity. RNAi against elt-3 (E) and elt-6 (F) prevents the health span–promoting effects of AP39. Panels A–D employed transgenic animals coexpressing elt-6::mCherry + mito::GFP in body-wall muscle, across 25 to 45 animals and two biological repeats. Panels (E and F) employed wild-type N2 animals. Movement rates are from 80-120 animals per condition, per time point. # denote significant effect of aging compared to untreated day 0 animals (#P < 0.05; ###P < 0.001). * denote significant effect of treatment for within-day comparisons against untreated animals (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).To verify the role of elt-6/elt-3, we examined the cytoskeleton (adherens junction) and mitochondrion-localized protein BAR-1/ β-catenin, loss of which is reported to upr-egulate gene clusters under regulation by elt-3 (55) which would, therefore, be anticipated to also down-regulate ELT-6. Consistent with this model, we observed that bar-1 RNAi prevented age-related increases in ELT-6 expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). Moreover, mtH2S did not synergistically lower age-related ELT-6 levels when combined with bar-1 RNAi (SI Appendix, Fig. S13), implying some functional association with mtH2S and bar-1/β-catenin (further supporting a role for mtH2S in modifiying the cytoskeleton via the elt-6/elt-3 circuit). While the precise causal mechanisms linking H2S-related mitochondrial improvements with the elt-6/elt-3 system and, subsequently, health span remains undefined, the mitochondrial mechanisms appear specific to the aging context; although we show aging mitochondrial decline and mtH2S acts through this TF circtuit, inducing acute severe mitochondrial decline via toxic drugs fails to activate ELT-6 despite major structural fragmentation of mitochondria (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). Combined, our systems biological studies provide evidence that mtH2S improves mitochondrial health to alter elt-6/elt-3 TFs, which likely act as a reguatory circuit governing cytoskeletal and peroxisomal gene clusters to, ultimately, modify health span.Discussion H2S is a diatomic signaling molecule that promotes healthy aging in C. elegans (20), yet the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic viability across the lifecourse remains unclear. In this study, we have demonstrated that low mtH2S doses extend C. elegans health span, which associates with improved mitochondrial integrity from young adulthood into older age. Multiple elements of H2S metabolic pathways, and FoxO transciption factors emerged as mechanisms governing both life span and health span, whereas the Nrf2 antioxidant system is dispensible for mtH2S-induced health span extension. Adult mtH2S treatments also increase health span, predominantly in later life, and associates with rejuvenation of key features of the aging transciptome, including mitochondrial function, cytoskeletal content, and peroxisomal metabolism, which appear to be controlled by a GATA transcription factor circuit. The ability of large amounts of untargeted H2S, administered from birth, to enhance C. elegans life span and health span, is well documented (17–20). Our data reveal 1000-fold lower doses of a mitochondrion-targeted (TPP+-driven) H2S donor (28) can account for the life span, health span, and neuromuscular strength extension elicited by H2S. Thus, small amounts of H2S transported to the mitochondria are likely responsible for, and the site of action of, H2S effects on longevity. Temporal analysis further revealed mtH2S improved mitochondrion integrity beginning in earlier life that was maintained throughout the lifecourse, thus delaying one of the primary cellular hallmarks of aging (25). Conversely, mtH2S did not increase movement rates or muscle strength until older age, likely owing to a lack of declines in muscle strength and habitual movement capacity during early adulthood, which is unsurprising, if decreasing H2S metabolism/synthesis is an aging pathology (56). These findings closely mirror the human phenotype, where a clear biphasic pattern of muscle aging emerges that involves early disruption to metabolic processes (57, 58) (as with C. elegans early loss of mitochondria integrity), which later manifests as exponential neuromuscular strength/ physical capacity declines (again, as occurs in C. elegans) that exceeds rates of musle mass losses (59, 60). As such, our data evidence that mtH2S can target the early mitochondrial metabolic perturbations during aging, possibly in preference over targeting respiratory function of existing mitochondria (61, 62) that attenuates the ensuing later changes in neuromuscular performance and health (25, 61, 62). While the mechanisms regulating H2S-induced longevity have been explored (19), understanding the molecules governing health span is at least equally valuable, given the growing societal burden of life span – health span dissociation. Of the fourteen genes targeted for established roles in H2S biology, two clear functional themes emerged as mechanisms of mtH2S life span and health span extension. First, the FoxO/daf-16 transcription factor is a highly conserved regulator of longevity across species (63) and in response to untargeted H2S (19). Our findings extend this to show daf-16 is also required for mtH2S-related health span improvements. Second, although exogenous H2S could hypothetically bypass the biochemical need for endogenous H2S synthesis, the H2S metabolism genes examined (most strikingly the mitochondria localized 3-MST/mpst-1) were required for health span extension by mtH2S. Moreover, mtH2S-induced sulfide increases were prevented by cth-2, mpst-1, or cbs-1 knockdown. Thus, while perhaps counterintuitive, presence of a functional H2S production system is a requirement for efficacious mtH2S treatments and might reflect the multifaceted cellular roles of the H2S enzymatic machinery and/or the diverse downstream consequences of loss of these enzymes (64). For example, H2S likely exerts at least part of its biological effects via cysteine persulfidation of multiple protein targets (65). The mitochondrially localized 3-MST/mpst-1 is also a trans-persulfidase (66), thus H2S enzyme knockdown could prevent mtH2S-mediated persulfidation events, through which H2S might partially act. Interestingly, despite fatal consqeuences of complete ETHE1 knockout in higher mammals (45), RNAi knockdown of the mitochondrial H2S catabolic enzyme ETHE1/ethe-1 strongly improved health span, possibly by mimicking mtH2S through mitochondrial accumulation of noncatabolized endogenous H2S. However, combined ethe-1 RNAi and mtH2S ablates health span extension, and life span becomes shortened at higher, but not lower (1 to 10 nM) mtH2S doses, potentially due to toxic mtH2S accumulation, implying tight physiological range of mtH2S hormesis. Overall, these mechanistic insights add further evidence that place mitochondria at the center of H2S-regulated health span. Activation of the Nrf2/skn-1 antioxidant system has also been reported to control H2S-based longevity in C. elegans (48). Oxidative stress and reactive oxidant species might be a secondary consequence of tissue aging that may exacerbate, rather than cause aging health decline (67–70). While corroborating the requirement of the Nrf2 pathway for H2S life span extension, multiple components of the Nrf2/skn-1 system, including the upstream activator DACF11/wdr-23 and downstream effector GCLC/gcs-1, were not required for mtH2S health span improvements. Knocking down KRIT1/kri-1, which activates Nrf2 through redox species generation (44), did prevent mtH2S-induced health span extension. However, since several Nrf2 system components are not mechanisms of mtH2S health span extension, KRIT1/kri-1 health span regulation likely relies on its alternate functions in H2S synthesis (44). Importantly, these results highlight clear dissociation between the fundamental mechanisms governing life span vs. health span, indicating that oxidative stress protection pathways are dispensable for mtH2S-extended health span, but not life span. The potential for developmentally programmed metabolic patterns with larval H2S treatments (21–23) renders the efficacy of postadulthood H2S therapies uncertain. We establish health span alone is extended with young adult mtH2S treatments, and when initiated in the presence of existing aging tissue pathologies. We, and others (26), found that mitochondrial fragmentation begins early in life (2 days postadulthood), and in this study we report that mtH2S improves health span when administered at this time. Similarly, muscle structural and proteostasis abnormalities occur later (4 days postadulthood), and mtH2S also displays efficacy during this therapeutic window. Mitochondrial H2S is, therefore, a viable adult-onset antiaging therapeutic opportunity. Transcriptomic studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms regulating adult mtH2S health span extension revealed clear distinctions from larval treatments. Whilet administering mtH2S from L1 stage caused broad transcriptional features that diverged only slightly from wild-type animals only in older age, adult-onset mtH2S caused strong rejuvenation of the aging transcriptome toward “younger” gene profiles. Cluster analysis revealed adult mtH2S suppressed aging-induced increases in FoxO/daf-16 pathway expression. Whilet contrasting our observation that daf-16 is a required effector of larval mtH2S treatment, suppression of aging daf-16 levels with adult mtH2S implies divergent effects of FoxO induction during development vs. postdevelopment (71). This is consistent with earlier reports that longevity caused by up-regulating FoxO/daf-16 (via insulin receptor/daf-2 mutation) is primarily established during larval development (72). Conversely, sarcopenia associates with postdevelopmental FoxO upregulation across species (58), corresponding with later life metabolic reprogramming to compensate for aging health decline (57, 58). Consistent with a potential beneficial aging effect of reduced postadulthood FoxO expression, are the moderate health span improvements we report with mtH2S-related daf-16 suppression. This phenomenon underscores an unexplained paradox in aging research, whereby developmentally programmed life span extension (e.g., with increased FoxO signaling) presents at the expense of health span (7). Indeed, in people, FoxO genetic variants correlate with centenarians (73), yet impaired insulin signaling/ increased FoxO induced during adulthood causes serious clinical complications (e.g., diabetes, sarcopenia). Our data support a model whereby postdevelopmental, aging-induced increases in FoxO expression are harmful to health span (71), and drug interventions such as mtH2S that lower this response improve health whilet having minimal effect on longevity. Last, adult mtH2S also caused suppression of age-related increases in mitophagy and, most prominently, ribosomal biogenesis. Thus, mtH2S might mitigate unchecked mitophagy by preventing the mitochondrial dysfunction that promotes mitophagy with age (74), and promote improved translational efficiency as previously proposed to underpin physical activity-based anti-aging regimens (75, 76). Adult mtH2S treatment also better maintained later-life expression of lowered aging transcriptomic profiles. Genes clustering to mitochondrion function featured heavily, lending further support to the central role of mitochondria in mtH2S-mediated health span. Expression of muscle cytoskeletal components also decreased with age, which was minimized by adult mtH2S administration, with top ranked hub components largely represented by cytoskeletal (e.g., troponin regulation) factors. Given the later life temporal correlation between increased muscle structural genes and movement/strength capacity, mtH2S represents a promising neuromuscular health intervention in older age. Last, loss of metabolic plasticity is a common feature of aging across species (25). We found progressive reduction in expression of metabolic functional clusters across aging that was increased with adult onset mtH2S. Notably, metabolic cluster hub genes were strongly enriched for peroxisomal components. Peroxisomes are essential for proper functioning of all cell types, compartmentalizing enzymes regulating, e.g., fatty acid β-oxidation and hydrogen peroxide metabolism. Several facets of peroxisome dysfunction cause accelerated aging (77), and our data suggest peroxisome function can be sustained by mtH2S across life span. For example, dhs-28 regulates age-dependent peroxisome loss, knockdown of which extends C. elegans life span (78), and our findings identify dhs-28 as a top ranked, mtH2S-responsive hub component. Moreover, we confirm the mechanistic relevance of our identified peroxisomal transcriptomic targets by showing knockdown of the ctl-2 hub gene prevents mtH2S-induced health span extension. Growing evidence also highlights inextricable cross talk between peroxisome and mitochondrial function (79). Indeed, caloric restriction–induced longevity [whose mechanisms converge with those of H2S (80)], requires mitochondria structural maintenance which, in turn, promotes peroxisome fatty acid oxidation (81). Our early-life improvements in mitochondrial integrity, combined with mitochondria localizing H2S, demonstrate improvements in mitochondrial integrity precede, and perhaps regulate, later life improvements in peroxisome capacity. Additionally, the lack of mechanistic regulation of health span by the Nrf2 antioxidant system implies that improved peroxisome fatty acid oxidation, as opposed to lowered reactive oxygen species generation, underpin peroxisomal effects of mtH2S on healthy aging. Transcription factor-binding site analysis of our transcriptomic data identified the GATA TF circuit elt-6/elt-3 as putatively regulating the health span benefits of adult onset mtH2S, which were subsequently verified by our mechanistic experiments. Previous work established age-related elt-6 upregulation and downstream repression of elt-3, which accounted for altered expression of ~1,300 “aging” genes (54), which might comprise an evolutionarily conserved element of natural aging adaptation that promotes longevity, perhaps at the expense of health span, similarly to FoxO. Here, we confirm the relevance of this aging TF axis and establish elt-6/elt-3 as mechanisms through which mtH2S and, either interrelatedly or independently via bar-1/ β-catenin, act to affect aging health. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction per se is insufficient to explain elt-6 upregulation, since severe toxin-induced mitochondrial insults fail to induce ELT-6. Thus, some as yet unknown specificity to age-related mitochondrial decline alters the elt-6 pathway to induce gene expression changes that impair health span. Regardless, our combined functional, morphologic, transcriptomic, and mechanistic results point to a model where aging mitcohondrial decline activates GATA TFs to alter gene expression, centered on cytoskeletal and peroxisomal gene clusters, to impair animal health. Crucially, mtH2S is an efficacious therapeutic approach for targeting the mitochondria to reverse this aging signaling axis and, ultimately, improve health span. In conclusion, a systems biological approach identifies the mitochondria as the primary site of H2S action for slowing aging, with distinct molecular mechanisms underpinning life span vs. health span extension. Unlike life span, increased mtH2S health span does not require activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant system. Adult-onset mtH2S also increases health span alone, which associates with unique aging transcriptomic signatures compared to life span–extending developmental mtH2S treatments, under the control of elt-6/elt-3 GATA transcription factors. The emergence of neuromuscular health improvements in later life might also be underpinned by temporally correlated, mtH2S-responsive transcriptomic features of mitochondria, peroxisomal metabolism, and cytoskeletal function. Finally, the comparably lower mtH2S donor doses (vs. nontargeted NaGYY4137; >3 orders of magnitude difference) required for aging health benefits, combined with efficacy in adult animals and high conservation of associated mechanisms, renders mtH2S a possible translational antiaging therapy.Materials and Methods C. elegans Maintenance and Experiment Design. The strains used in this study were N2 wild-type and CB5600 (ccIs4251 (Pmyo-3::Ngfp-lacZ; Pmyo-3::Mtgfp)) and were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre (CGC, University of Minnesota). For maintenance, C. elegans were cultured at 20 °C on OP50 E. coli seeded NGM agar plates, as previously described (82). For all experiments, the first day of adulthood was considered as Day 0. For drug exposure experiments, unless stated otherwise, L1 worms synchronized by gravity floatation were cultured at 20 °C on OP50 E. coli seeded NGM plates containing either 100 nM AP39 + 0.01% DMSO, 100 nM or 100 mM NaGYY4137, 0.01% DMSO or no drug. The mitochondrion-targeted H2S donor compound, AP39, was synthesized in-house by the Whiteman lab, as previously described (83, 84). The NaGYY4137 (85) untargeted H2S donor compound was also synthesized in-house. Compound solutions were freshly prepared for every use and added to plates the evening before animal transfers. For developmental treatments, drug dosing was started from the L1 larval stage and continued throughout the life course. For adult drug treatments, gravity synchronized L1 larvae were grown on NGM agar seeded with OP50 only for 60 h to reach young adulthood, after which drug treatments were started at either day 0, day 2, or day 4 postadulthood. Adult animals were transferred every 48 h to fresh plates to remove progeny and maintain consistent food and drug concentrations.Survival Assay and Measures of C. elegans Locomotion and Maximal Strength Production. Adult animals were scored and transferred to fresh plates every 48 h. The animals were scored as dead when they failed to move in response to stimulus with a needle. Animals that were lost, killed during transfer, or died as a result of (e.g.) egg laying defects were censored. Total animal numbers were n = 300 per condition, across three biological replicates. Locomotion assays were performed using WMicrotracker and maximal strength production was assessed using the ‘NemaFlex’ microfluidic device (36) (See SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods).Mitochondrial and Myofibrillar Imaging. Mitochondria within body wall muscle cells of the CB5600 (ccIs4251 (Pmyo-3::Ngfp-lacZ; Pmyo-3::Mtgfp)) strain were imaged using an Olympus CKX41 microscope (Olympus UK Ltd. London). The worms were imaged by GFP fluorescence microscopy at 40× magnification. Approximately 20 to 30 animals per condition were placed in 20 µL M9 on a microscope slide and immobilized with a cover slip. Images were taken of myofibers or mitochondria in body-wall muscle from both head and tail regions of every animal and visually classified as either well-networked, moderately fragmented, or severely fragmented (for mitochondrial quantification), or organized, moderately disorganized, and severely disorganized (for myofibrillar quantification) as previously described (26, 86). The overall proportion of mitochondrial or myofibrillar classifications was obtained by normalizing to the total muscle cell count within each treatment condition (~150 to 300 muscle cells per condition from 30 to 60 animals per time point) across two biological replicates.Measurement of Citrate Synthase Activity. Wild-type N2 animals were roughly age synchronized as previously described and grown for ~60 h to young adulthood on fresh OP50 bacterial lawns 20 °C. Animals were transferred to fresh OP50 plates every 48 h to remove progeny and prevent population starvation, and 50 animals collected per condition, per time point (days 0, 2, 4, and 12 postadulthood) and per replicate. Citrate synthase activity (CS) was measured in isolated mitochondrial pellets, as described in Supplemental methods section.RNA Interference Protocols. All RNAi experiments were performed using age synchronized L1 larval stage animals by gravity flotation and grown for 60 h on NGM agar plates containing 1 mM IPTG, 50 µg/mL ampicillin. The plates were seeded with 200 μL HT115 (DE3) bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA against the genes screened. The Ahringer RNAi library (87) was utilized, purchased from Source Bioscience (Cambridge, UK). HT115 (DE3) bacteria containing the empty L4440 plasmid vector was used as controls. Full details of each RNAi protocol for health span/life span screens, or plate-based experiments can be viewed in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section.RNA Isolation for Next-Generation Sequencing. Synchronized worms were grown on NGM agar plates until young adulthood and treated with AP39 mtH2S from either L1 or day 0, as described above. On sample collection day, 100 worms were manually picked and added to 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent (Thermofisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) prior to RNA extractions (see SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section for details).RNA-seq Data Analyses. After RNA sequencing data preprocessing (see SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section), the DESeq2 package for R (88) was used to test for differential gene expression. Establishing approaches to adaptive shrinkage methods (89) and control for false discovery rate (FDR) were employed. DEGreport R was applied to normalized counts to group by expression profile any gene differentially regulated between treatments and/or time points. Functional enrichment analysis of defined gene clusters was then undertaken using the gprofiler2 package for R (90). Each gene cluster was also input into the Online Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING, v11.5; ref. 91) to infer respective PPI networks. Full details of the bioinformatic pipeline employed are provided in Supplemental methods section.7-azido-4-Methylcoumarin Measures of Total Sulfide Levels. In all, 120 animals were picked into M9 buffer in 1.5 mL low-bind eppendorphs and washed three times with 1 mL sterile M9 to clear bacterial debris and progeny. Samples were snap-frozen in 40 µL M9 and stored at −80 °C until analysis (within 1 wk). Sulfide content was assessed as described previously (13, 86) as described in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section.ELT-6 Fluorescent Reporter Quantification. The SD1550 strain harboring an elt-6 fluorescent promoter and mitochondrial GFP (ccIs4251 [(pSAK2) myo-3p::GFP::LacZ::NLS + (pSAK4) myo-3p::mitochondrial GFP + dpy-20(+)] I. stIs10178 [elt-6p::HIS-24::mCherry + unc-119(+)] was imaged on an upright epifluorescent microscope (BX43, Olympus Life Science, UK). All elt-6 images were taken with mCherry fluorescence at 500-ms exposure and GFP fluorescence set to 50-ms exposure for mitochondrial images. Single images were taken from the head for ELT-6, as the sole site of ELT-6 reporter expression pattern, and from head and tail regions for mitochondrial characterisation across 40-60 animals per condition, per time point. Mitochondrial images were analyzed as detailed above, and ELT-6 images were quantified in ImageJ by performing integrated density quantification on each fluorescent image, subtracting background fluorescence.Mitochondrial Toxic Stress Assays in ELT-6 Transgenic Reporter Animals. Age-synchronized SD1550 animals were grown to young adulthood on 33-mm NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria. Approximately 30 day 0 adults where then picked into 40 μL of either 100 μM hydrogen peroxide (Sigma, UK; 7722-84-1) or 5 mM sodium arsenite (Santa Cruz, DE; 7784-46-5) diluted in M9 for 1- and 2-h exposures, respectively. For rotenone and antimycin A exposures, animals were picked into 40 μL 50 μM or 100 μM concentrations, respectively, diluted in 20 mg/mL OP50/NGM bacteria and incubated for 4 h. Tubes where then washed three times with M9 before animals were pipetted onto slides and immobilized by a coverslip. Both ELT-6 and mitochondrial images were then captured and analyzed as detailed above.Mitochondrial Superoxide Assessment. Superoxide levels were measured using MitoSOX (Invitrogen, UK) as described previously (86, 92). For day 0 measures, animals were grown on OP50 plates until L3 larval stage, where ~30 animals were then picked onto petri plates + OP50 seeded with a final plate concentration of 10 μM MitoSOX and left to incubate in the dark for 24 h. The same exposures were performed for day 4 and day 10 measures (i.e., day 3 and day 9 adults picked onto MitoSOX plates for 24 h, respectively). On the day of imaging, animals were washed from plates with M9 buffer into 1.5 mL low-bind tubes and washed three times to clear the outer cuticle of probe. Animals were then placed on OP50 plates for 1-h to clear residual probe from the gut. Animals were then picked into 20 μL M9 buffer on glass slides with glass coverslip. Images were taken with a 40× objective with green light excitation and a 1-s exposure rate. The terminal bulb was manually selected in ImageJ and integrated fluorescence density was normalized to the total area of analysis and background fluorescence removed.Statistics and Data Analysis. Statistics and graph generation were performed in GraphPad Prism 9. Significance was determined by paired t test or 2-way ANOVA, with post hoc multiple comparison tests. For survival analyses, the Log-Rank (Mantel Cox) test was used.Supplementary Material Appendix 01 (PDF) Click here for additional data file.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Age‐related muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous health risk factors and poor quality of life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of bisphosphonates as an anti‐sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear.Methods Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500 μM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates) using a microfluidic chip device. The effects of ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFP‐tagged myofibres or mitochondria at days 0, 4 and 6 post‐adulthood. Mechanisms of ZA‐mediated healthspan extension were determined using combined ZA and targeted RNAi gene knockdown across the life‐course.Results We found 100 nM and 1 μM ZA increased lifespan (P < 0.001) and healthspan [954 ± 53 (100 nM) and 963 ± 48 (1 μM) vs. 834 ± 59% (untreated) population activity AUC, P < 0.05]. 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan (P < 0.0001) but not healthspan (758.9 ± 37 vs. 834 ± 59, P > 0.05), whereas 100 and 500 μM ZA were larval lethal. ZA (1 μM) significantly improved myofibrillar structure on days 4 and 6 post‐adulthood (83 and 71% well‐organized myofibres, respectively, vs. 56 and 34% controls, P < 0.0001) and increased well‐networked mitochondria at day 6 (47 vs. 16% in controls, P < 0.01). Genes required for ZA‐mediated healthspan extension included fdps‐1/FDPS‐1 (278 ± 9 vs. 894 ± 17% population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, respectively, P < 0.0001), daf‐16/FOXO (680 ± 16 vs. 894 ± 17%, P < 0.01) and agxt‐2/BAIBA (531 ± 23 vs. 552 ± 8%, P > 0.05). Life/healthspan was extended through knockdown of igdb‐1/FNDC5 (635 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10% population activity AUC in gene knockdown vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01) and sir‐2.3/SIRT‐4 (586 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05), with no synergistic improvements in ZA co‐treatment vs. knockdown alone [651 ± 12 vs. 635 ± 10% (igdb‐1/FNDC5) and 583 ± 9 vs. 586 ± 10% (sir‐2.3/SIRT‐4), both P > 0.05]. Conversely, let‐756/FGF21 and sir‐2.2/SIRT‐4 were dispensable for ZA‐induced healthspan [630 ± 6 vs. 523 ± 10% population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01 (let‐756/FGF21) and 568 ± 9 vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05 (sir‐2.2/SIRT‐4)].Conclusions Despite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delays Caenorhabditis elegans sarcopenia, which translates to improved neuromuscular function across the life course. Bisphosphonates might, therefore, be an immediately exploitable anti‐sarcopenia therapy.Keywords: Healthspan, Lifespan, Muscle, Sarcopenia, Zoledronic acid",
    "introduction": "Introduction Age‐related muscle decline, termed ‘sarcopenia’, is classified as a specific disease associated with numerous health risk factors in the elderly, prevalent in at least 10% of older populations 1 and up to 31% as a co‐morbidity. 2 Despite associated annual healthcare costs that run into the billions 3 and significant impacts on individual quality of life and all‐cause mortality, 4 efficacious treatment strategies against sarcopenia remain limited. Physical activity plus targeted nutrition represents the most effective chronic modifiable lifestyle strategy against sarcopenia. 5 However, ageing muscle growth responses to these interventions are sub‐optimal, 6 and certain older individuals can be unable (i.e., through injury and/or access to exercise facilities) or unwilling to participate in regular vigorous activity. Indeed, ~50–70% of those aged 75+ years are physically inactive, 7 meaning complementary pharmaceutical therapies are relevant to a significant portion of the ageing population. Established drugs that modify human muscle ageing are limited, and importantly, many of these drugs display variable therapeutic efficacy and associate with harmful side‐effect profiles that render them inappropriate for long‐term clinical use. For example, rapamycin holds variable efficacy against sarcopenia indices across health and disease 8 but is a potent immunosuppressant 9 unsuitable for chronic use in otherwise healthy humans. Drug identification efforts might instead focus on repurposing existing clinically approved compounds for sarcopenic indications as a realistic, immediately employable approach to therapeutic discovery. Bisphosphonates are chemically stable derivatives of endogenous inorganic pyrophosphate, a metabolite of multiple biosynthetic reactions and present in most tissues, including muscle. 10 Recapitulating the effects of inorganic pyrophosphate, bisphosphonates inhibit calcification and lower hydroxyapatite degradation, 11 while also promoting osteoclast apoptosis to effectively protect against bone loss. As such, bisphosphonates have become a standard clinical strategy against osteoporosis and a variety of skeletal conditions. 12 Yet skeletal muscle health and bone function are inextricably linked: Effective mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle‐bone communication is essential to muscle and bone health, 13 with sarcopenia and osteoporosis often presenting together. 14 Osteoporosis patients prescribed alendronate or pamidronate (the most popular first‐line bisphosphonates) for between 6 months and 3 years display significant increases in muscle strength 15 and total muscle mass. 16 Recent reports on the most potent bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid (ZA), show improved muscle morphology, strength and mass in rodent models of cancer cachexia, 17 Duchenne muscular dystrophy 18 and denervation‐induced muscle atrophy. 19 Retrospective analysis of osteoporosis patients prescribed ZA for 3 years also exhibit significant increases in total lean muscle mass, compared with a loss of muscle mass in untreated controls. 20 In the ageing context, ZA‐treated fruit flies displayed increased survival and improved climbing ability across the life course, suggesting improved neuromuscular ageing. 21 However, the direct anti‐sarcopenic efficacy of ZA has not been established. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an established model of ageing, displaying ordered, progressive age‐related deterioration of multiple tissues, including muscle. 22 C. elegans muscle is also highly morphologically and metabolically similar to human muscle and has high genetic orthology (60–85%) of sub‐muscular systems with people. 23 As with fruit flies, C. elegans are invertebrates that do not possess clear orthologues of mammalian bone secretory factors (‘osteokines’). 24 C. elegans are, therefore, an excellent system for understanding muscle‐specific mechanisms of bisphosphonates, independently of bone‐derived confounders. We thus employed C. elegans as a genomic model of ageing muscle decline to establish the bone‐independent effects, and mechanisms of, bisphosphonates on sarcopenia progression as part of an ageing drug translational pipeline with realistic, near‐term applicability in the clinic.",
    "methods": "Methods Assessing zoledronic acid effects on Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and healthspan Wild‐type (N2 stain) animals were age synchronized by gravity flotation and ~80 L1 larvae were placed on 33 mm petri dishes (20 L1 per 33 mm plate) containing 2 mL NGM agar [50 mM NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) bacteriological peptone, 1.7% (w/v) agar, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 25 mM KH2PO4 (pH 6), 12.9 μM cholesterol] and seeded with 200 μL of OP50 Escherichia coli bacteria. For ZA treatments, 100 μL of dilute compound (i.e. – 100 μL of 2.3 μM, 23 μM, 230 μM, 2.3 mM and 11.5 μM intermediate dilutions in ddH2O for 100 nM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM and 500 μM concentrations, respectively) were diluted into a 2.3 mL plate volume to achieve the desired final concentration. Control animals were grown on plates seeded with 100 μL of ddH2O to account for any diluting of bacterial lawns. Animals were grown on petri dishes for ~48 h at 20°C to reach young adulthood, then washed off using 3 mL M9 buffer (3 g KH2PO4, 6 g Na2HPO4, 5 g NaCl, 1 mL 1 M MgSO4 per litre) and pooled into 60 cm petri dishes. From these pooled samples, ~70 young adults were collected and loaded into microfluidic chips (Infinity chips; Nemalife Inc., TX) using a 2.5 mL syringe, where the animals remained throughout the rest of the life course. Using the Infinity screening system (Nemalife Inc., TX), on every day of the life course, chips were washed for 90 s with liquid NGM to remove progeny followed by a further 90 s recording for subsequent computational analysis of animal survival and locomotion. Chips were then injected with ~200 μL of 20 mg/mL OP50 supplemented with ZA or ddH2O. Specifically, 980 μL of 20 mg/mL OP50 was supplemented with 20 μL of the required ZA intermediate dilution (i.e., 5 μM, 50 μM and 500 μM intermediates for 100 nM, 1 μM and 10 μM of ZA, respectively) or 20 μL of ddH2O for controls. Chips were then stored in petri dishes at 20°C for the next 24 h with a damp, sterile tissue and parafilmed to avoid the microfluidic arena drying out. Lifespan was performed using the Infinity system screening platform (Nemalife Inc., TX). Specifically, 90 s videos were split into three still image frames (frames 1, 300 and 900), and the Infinity screening system automates a bounding box around every (~70–80) whole animal in the microfluidic chip. Using the Infinity system software (Nemalife Inc., TX), computational coefficients determine animal displacements from outside this bounding box and were used for both lifespan and healthspan analysis. Animals were deemed dead if coefficients were <0.01 (no movement) and alive if values were >0.01. For healthspan analysis, movement rate was employed as one of the most robust measures of animal healthspan. 25 For quantification, animals that obtained coefficients of 0.01–0.40 (i.e., unable to move more than half its body length between subsequent frames) were deemed inactive. Animals with scores of 0.41–1 were classed as ‘active’ animals (i.e., moving half of, or more than its full body‐length in displacement between subsequent frames). Both lifespan and healthspan were determined every day using videos of microfluidic‐housed populations. Average values were taken from movement scores between all three frames. In addition to software automation, each video was manually corrected for any false positives/box deformations that could skew movement scores. Daily mean movement values were converted to area under the curve to denote total population movement scores across the entire life course. Zoledronic acid effects on sarcopenia dystrophic progression with age The anti‐sarcopenic effects of ZA (1 μM) was visualized and quantified using transgenic strains expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)‐tagged sarcomeres (PJ727 strain: jls01 (myo‐3:: GFP, rol‐6 (su1006)); unc‐54::lacZ V) or GFP‐tagged mitochondria (CB5600 strain: ccIs4251 (Pmyo‐3:: Ngfp‐lacZ; Pmyo‐3:: Mtgfp) I; him‐8 (e1489) IV). Strains were grown on 33 mm plates containing 2 mL NGM agar seeded with 200 μL of OP50 ± ZA, as detailed above. Animals were transferred onto fresh plates every 2 days after young adult stage to remove progeny and prevent population starvation. To image sarcomere and mitochondrial structure, ~30 animals per condition/time point were picked into 20 μL of M9 buffer on a microscope slide (VWR Superfrost, UK) with a cover slip placed on top and imaged immediately using an upright epiflourescent microscope (BX43, Olympus Life Science, UK). Images of the body wall muscles were captured from the head and tail region of each animal (avoiding the mid‐animal/vulva region that exhibits frequent egg‐laying induced tissue disruption) using an Orca‐spark camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) set to 50 ms exposure rate and a gain of 3.4 dB for all acquired images. Approximately 10 individual muscle cells were scored per animal equating to ~300 muscle cells per condition/replicate and scored as either well networked, moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscle sarcomere or mitochondria structures as previously described 26 (see Figure S1 for representative images of each class of structural defect). Analysis was carried out in ImageJ, and the number of well networked, moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscles were expressed as a percentage of total muscle cells visible and analysed within each animal. RNA interference and combined zoledronic acid treatments for lifespan and healthspan analysis The effects of RNAi treatments on animal lifespan/healthspan were determined using bacterial feeding vectors and performed in the Infinity screening system, as described above. All bacterial lawns expressing double‐stranded RNA were grown from the MRC Ahringer Library of bacterial clones to target (fdps‐1: R06C1.2; daf‐16: R13H8.1; agxt‐2: T09B4.8; igdb‐1: T04A11.3; let‐756: C05D11.4; sir‐2.2: F46G10.7: sir‐2.3: F46G10.3). Each clone was streaked onto LB plates supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and 25 μg/mL carbenicillin and grown overnight at 37°C. Single colonies were then picked into sterile LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and grown for 16 h with shaking at 180 rpm at 37°C. After 16 h incubation, 0.4 mM isopropyl β‐d‐1‐thiogalactopyranoside was added for RNAi induction, with further shaking at 180 rpm for 2 h at 37°C as described previously. 27 After 18 h incubation, tubes were spun at 3000 g for 10 min to obtain bacterial pellets. Liquid NGM was added to each bacterial pellet to reach a final bacteria concentration of 20 mg/mL, adding isopropyl β‐d‐1‐thiogalactopyranoside to a final 1 mM concentration before use. For combined ZA treatments, the same bacterial preparation was performed, but with 20 μL of dilute ZA supplemented to 1 mL of 20 mg/mL OP50 in NGM for a final concentration of 1 μM. On every day of the life course, after washing/recording using the Infinity system as detailed above, ~200 μL of RNAi bacteria ± ZA (1 μM) was injected into the microfluidic chips before storing in petri dishes at 20°C for 24 h until washing/refeeding the next day (with drug dilution/control). All bacteria and drug solutions were prepared fresh daily until cessation of life. RNAi experiments were always conducted alongside empty vector controls (PL4440). Statistics Lifespan analysis was performed using Kaplan–Meier curves assessed by the log‐rank (Mantell–Cox) test. Multiple comparisons of survival curves were performed manually using the Bonferroni‐corrected threshold. For movement rate, area under the curve (AUC) was performed on mean movement values across each day of adulthood (averages taken from across all three frames). AUC values and standard deviations obtained from replicate screens were then assessed by one‐way ANOVA in GraphPad, Prism. Both mitochondrial and sarcomere quantification were analysed by two‐way ANOVA using the percentage classification score from individual animals across biological repeats. All statistics were performed in GraphPad, Prism (San Diego, California USA).",
    "results": "Results Zoledronic acid extends Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and healthspan Higher ZA concentrations (500 and 100 μM) were larval lethal, and 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan (median survival = 11 vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001; Figure 1A) without significantly impairing healthspan (animal movement AUC = 758.9 ± 37.08 vs. 833.9 ± 59.91 for controls, P > 0.05; Figure 1A). Conversely, lifespan extension was observed with lower ZA doses of 1 μM (median survival = 16 days, P < 0.001; Figure 1B) and 100 nM (median survival = 16 days, P < 0.0001; Figure 1C). These lifespan‐promoting ZA doses also associated with healthspan extension at 1 μM (AUC = 963.1 ± 48.74, P < 0.05; Figure 1B) and 100 nM (AUC = 953.8 ± 53.77, P < 0.05; Figure 1C) treatments. Additionally, significant movement decline onset became apparent in day 9 control animals (P > 0.01 vs. day 1 adults), which was upheld across all ZA treatment doses at this single time point (+22.2, +31.8 and +17.6% population activity on day 9 vs. untreated controls in 10 μM, 1 μM and 100 nM, respectively). ZA thus acts dose‐dependently to augment animal longevity and health across the life course. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Zoledronic acid acts dose‐dependently to improve C. elegans survival and movement capacity. (A) Animals exposed to 10 μM zoledronic acid (ZA) exhibit significant declines in survivability (top) to untreated controls (median survival: 10 vs. 14 days, respectively, P < 0.0001), however, show no significant impairment in movement capacity (bottom) across whole life (P = 0.208). Conversely, both 1 μM (B) and 100 nM (C) were beneficial to animal survival (1 μM median survival: 16 days, P < 0.001; 100 nM: 16 days, P < 0.0001), with paralleled improvements in movement capacity throughout the life course. (D) Graphical overlay of lifespan curves from each ZA concentration versus untreated controls. (E) Overlay of life course movement rates between ZA doses displayed as % mean AUC. Data are mean + SEM of three biological repeats, with ~225–300 animals per condition/time point. Asterisks denote significance to N2 controls. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Zoledronic acid delays age‐related declines in muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial integrity To understand the effects of ZA on progressive sarcomere dystrophy across age, transgenic C. elegans expressing GFP‐tagged myosin were treated with 1 μM ZA. Corroborating previous reports on the temporal age‐related loss of sub‐cellular muscle structures, 22 untreated wild‐type animals displayed a significant −35.6% decline in organized myofibrillar structure by day 4 post‐adulthood (P < 0.0001; Figure 2A,B), which worsened to −58.0% by day 6 post‐adulthood (P < 0.0001). ZA delayed loss of organized sarcomeres until day 6 post‐adulthood (−15.6%, P < 0.01), and significantly increased the number of muscle cells displaying organized sarcomeres versus untreated controls at days 4 (83.9% vs. 54.4%) and 6 (71.1% vs. 31.4%) post‐adulthood (both P < 0.0001, Figure 2A,B). ZA also decreased muscle cells categorized as ‘moderately disorganized’ on days 4 (17.0% vs. 38.2%, P < 0.01) and 6 (27.6 vs. 53.4%, P < 0.0001) post‐adulthood and reduced the number of ‘severely disorganized’ muscles on day 6 post‐adulthood (1.8% vs. 13.1%, P < 0.0001). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Zoledronic acid attenuates age‐related loss of sarcomere integrity. (A) Onset of myofibrillar disorganization occurred at days 4 and 6 post‐adulthood in untreated animals and was significantly attenuated in zoledronic treated (1 μM) animals (all P < 0.0001). (B) Representative images of untreated (top) and zoledronic acid treated (bottom) myofibres. Data are means of two biological repeats, with ~50–60 animals per condition/time point, and images taken from head and tail regions of each animal (~120–150 muscle cells per condition/time point). Asterisks denote significance between zoledronic acid and untreated animals within each structural category (** P < 0.01, **** P < 0.0001). ‘¥’ denotes significant loss of myofibrillar structure for within‐condition comparisons versus day 0 values (¥¥¥ P < 0.001, ¥¥¥¥ P < 0.0001).We next examined the effects of ZA on mitochondrial integrity, given the strong associations of mitochondrial structure and function with ageing animal health. In line with previous wild‐type ageing studies, 22 loss of networked mitochondria occurred by day 2 post‐adulthood (Figure S2), which progressively worsened at day 4 (−42.6%, P < 0.0001) and day 6 post‐adulthood (−67.0%, P < 0.0001; Figure 3A,B). ZA treatment did not delay the onset of well‐networked mitochondria loss at day 2 (Figure S2) or day 4 post‐adulthood (51.8%, P < 0.0001). However, ZA prevented progressive mitochondrial fragmentation at day 6 post‐adulthood (46.7%, P > 0.05 vs. day 4), which was also significantly higher than in untreated animals (46.7 vs. 16.1%, P < 0.01). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Zoledronic acid attenuates age‐related loss of muscle mitochondrial structure. (A) Untreated animals displayed progressive declines in well‐networked mitochondria across days 0, 4 and 6 post‐adulthood (for each time point, P < 0.0001). Zoledronic acid treatment (1 μM) animals saw a similar decline by day 4; however, no further decline was evident by day 6 post‐adulthood, showing significant improvement when compared to untreated animals at this time point (P < 0.01). (B) Representative images of untreated (top) and zoledronic acid treated (bottom) data are means of two biological repeats with ~50–60 animals per condition/time point, and images taken from head and tail regions of each animal (~120–150 muscle cells per condition/time point). Asterisks denote significance between zoledronic acid and untreated animals within each structural category (** P < 0.01). ‘¥’ denotes significant loss of myofibrillar structure for within‐condition comparisons versus day 0 values (¥¥¥¥ P < 0.0001). Zoledronic acid‐mediated healthspan extension acts through multiple mechanisms The lifespan extending effects of ZA have previously been attributed to the mevalonate cholesterol/isoprenoid lipid biosynthesis pathway and the FOXO family of transcription factors, 21 but their role in ZA‐induced healthspan extension is unknown. RNAi knockdown (KD) of fdps‐1, an orthologue of farnesyl diphosphate synthetase involved in the biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphate intermediates from mevalonate, impaired survival (median survival = 6 vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001) and healthspan (AUC = 287 ± 9 vs. 894 ± 17% population activity for controls, P < 0.0001), which was not improved by co‐treatment with 1 μM ZA (Figure 4A). Similarly, RNAi KD of the daf‐16/FOXO stress response pathway impaired survivability (median survival = 12 vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001) and healthspan (AUC = 680.5 ± 23.6 vs. 894.2 ± 17.4 for empty vector, P < 0.01) and prevented the beneficial effects of ZA treatment (Figure 4B). Figure 4. Open in a new tab FDPS, FOXO and BAIBA orthologues are required for the healthspan effects of zoledronic acid. Knockdown of FDPS‐1 (FDPS) with ZA co‐treatment (1 μM) prevents ZA mediated lifespan (top) and healthspan (bottom) extension (A). Similarly, knockdown of daf‐16 (FOXO) decreases survival and movement, with no improvement with ZA co‐treatment (B). The conserved bone‐muscle ortholog agxt‐2 (BAIBA) is required for ZA mediated improvement in survival and movement (C). Data are mean + SD of two repeats, with ~140–160 animals per condition/time point. Asterisks denote significance to empty vector. ** P < 0.01, **** P < 0.0001.The FOXO pathway is a global stress response system, inducible by a wide array of stimuli and a generic transcription factor regulating cellular responses across multiple drug families 28 that integrates multiple upstream signals to influence worm ageing. 29 Alternative, muscle‐centric mechanisms thus also likely contribute to the healthspan benefits of ZA. To probe potential muscle‐derived mechanisms of ZA‐induced healthspan extension, we examined the role of three putative myokines that exhibit altered expression across age and implicated in muscle‐bone crosstalk: agxt‐2/BAIBA, igdb‐1/FNDC5 and let‐756/FGF21. 24 Lifespan and healthspan were unaffected by KD of agxt‐2/BAIBA (β‐aminoisobutyric acid), a muscle‐borne bone protective factor 30 ; however, combined agxt‐2 KD with ZA treatment was unable to confer life/healthspan extension (Figure 4C). Conversely, the inhibition of igdb‐1 extended lifespan (median survival = 11 vs. 7 days for controls, P < 0.05) and improved healthspan (AUC = 634.5 ± 10.5 vs. 523 ± 10.0 for controls, P < 0.01), with similar life/healthspan extension observed upon co‐treatment with ZA (Figure 5A). Additionally, let‐756 appears dispensable for ZA‐induced healthspan effects: KD alone caused no significant alterations in survival or movement, whereas increased lifespan and healthspan was retained with combined let‐756 KD and ZA treatment (Figure 5B). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Genes either dispensable, or that associate with ZA's healthspan effects. Knockdown of igdb‐1 (FNDC5) significantly increased survival and healthspan, where ZA co‐treatment (1 μM) was not synergistic, but displayed similar improvements in lifespan (top) and healthspan (bottom) suggesting igdb‐1 might exhibit ZA‐induced downregulation (A), or act independently to increase healthspan. Conversely, let‐756 (FGF21, B) is dispensable for both lifespan and healthspan extension with ZA. The mitochondrial sirtuins displayed opposing effects; sir‐2.2 (SIRT‐4, C) is dispensable for ZA's healthspan effects, whereas sir‐2.3 (SIRT‐4) knockdown increased survival and movement (D), as did ZA co‐treatment, suggesting sir‐2.3 downregulation might mediate ZA's healthspan effects. Asterisks denote significance to empty vector controls. *P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, **** P < 0.0001. ‘#’ denote significance between ZA co‐treatments and gene inhibition alone. # P < 0.05, ## P < 0.01.Recent rodent work shows bisphosphonates attenuate denervation‐induced muscle atrophy via downregulation of sirtuin‐3 (SIRT3), one of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)‐dependent deacetylase family members. 19 Because SIRT3 is primarily mitochondrially localized, 31 we examined the role of two C. elegans mitochondrial sirtuins, sir‐2.2 and sir‐2.3, 32 for their role in ZA‐mediated lifespan and healthspan extension. Reinforcing a mitochondrial role of sir‐2.2 and sir‐2.3, RNAi KD of each gene caused increased mitochondrial fragmentation at day 0 post‐adulthood (Figure S3). While sir‐2.2 KD did not alter animal survival or healthspan, loss of sir‐2.2 blocked ZA's life extending properties but ZA‐induced healthspan extension remained (Figure 5C). Additionally, and in line with previous reports in C. elegans , 33 we find that knockdown of sir‐2.3 extends lifespan (Figure 5D) and healthspan (Figure 5H), which remains with combined ZA treatment but is not synergistically beneficial.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Despite the socio‐economic implications, treatment options for sarcopenia remain mostly limited to modifiable lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, which are incompletely effective. 34 Complementary drug interventions would, therefore, benefit a significant portion of the ageing population, yet effectual compounds that are safe for long‐term use remain elusive. Identifying drugs in clinical use and repurposing for sarcopenia indications could provide immediately exploitable pharmaceuticals for the general population. Bisphosphonates have been used to safely treat osteoporosis for decades. 35 Here, we report that bisphosphonates (ZA) extend C. elegans lifespan and healthspan, which associates with delayed onset of muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial decline. While general stress response pathways, such as FOXO, regulate these positive healthspan responses to ZA, we establish muscle‐centric myokines (agxt‐2 and igdb‐1) and mitochondrial sirtuin (sir‐2.3) as previously unknown regulators of bisphosphonate effects on ageing muscle health. Growing pre‐clinical 17 , 18 , 19 and human 20 evidence suggest that bisphosphonates not only preserve bone integrity but also exert muscle promoting effects across a variety of conditions. A recent study in fruit flies suggest similar effects might extend to the ageing process, where bisphosphonate treatment prolonged lifespan and animal healthspan. 21 We provide the first in vivo evidence for a direct role of chronic bisphosphonate administration in delaying age‐related muscle structural decline. Because ageing muscle architectural alterations are a hallmark of human sarcopenia that relate to lowered motility in animals, 22 bisphosphonate‐mediated sarcomere preservation could translate to reduced sarcopenia in higher animals and people. ZA also attenuated ageing muscle mitochondrial decline. Mitochondrial health is strongly linked with sarcopenic progression across species and mitochondrial structure corresponds with oxidative function 23 ; therefore, bisphosphonates might hold dual, and possibly interrelated, efficacy for maintaining muscle metabolic health and sarcomeric integrity. While we assessed animals at, and beyond, the point of onset of age‐related sub‐muscular decline, the anti‐sarcopenic efficacy of bisphosphonates into very old age remains to be determined. Nonetheless, using our microfluidic healthspan device 27 and animal movement rate as a robust index of health, 25 we demonstrate that early‐ to mid‐life muscle preservation translates to improved animal health across the entire life course. Bisphosphonates thus represent a promising strategy for maintaining muscle, and whole animal health into older age. In fruit flies, bisphosphonates increase lifespan through inhibition of the mevalonate metabolic pathway and downstream FOXO activation. 21 We extend this by implicating the mevalonate‐FOXO system as necessary for bisphosphonate‐mediated health improvements across the life course. The sterol and non‐sterol isoprenoids synthesized via mevalonate localize to plasma membranes and influence several vital cellular processes, the dysfunction of which associate with wide ranging pathologies including cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. 36 Our data suggest that sarcopenia can be added to this list, whereby knockdown of a key enzyme in mevalonate metabolism, farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (fdps‐1), allows normal larval development to adulthood and young adult (day 1) movement rates, corroborating earlier reports of normal L4 larvae muscle architecture upon fdps‐1 RNAi. 37 Thereafter, downregulation of fdps‐1 causes rapid neuromuscular functional decline (i.e., animal motility), likely indicative of accelerated sarcopenia. Because zoledronic acid is unable to improve lifespan and healthspan in fdps‐1 or daf‐16 knockdown animals, the mevalonate‐FOXO pathway is strongly implicated in the ageing neuromuscular health benefits of bisphosphonates. Bi‐directional communication between muscle and bone has long been established, including mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle‐bone signalling. 13 , 24 We, therefore, examined the mechanistic role of three putative muscle‐derived signalling factors (‘myokines’) involved in muscle‐bone crosstalk that exhibit altered age‐related function. 24 Of these, agxt‐2/BAIBA was necessary for the positive healthspan effects of ZA, while agxt‐2 KD alone was not harmful to animal longevity or health. BAIBA promotes insulin sensitivity, anti‐inflammation 38 and osteocyte survival in mice, 39 and its expression does not decline with age 39 ; thus, BAIBA‐mediated muscle/health benefits of bisphosphonates would be anticipated to remain in older age. Knockdown of igdb‐1/FNDC5 extended worm lifespan and healthspan, countering human studies implicating low circulating FNDC5 as a sarcopenia biomarker. 40 The healthspan effects of igdb‐1 KD were also comparable with ZA co‐treatment. This inability of idgb‐1 KD to neither ablate nor synergistically augment the positive effects of ZA could be interpreted as ZA exerting healthspan‐promoting inhibitory effects on igdb‐1 or, alternatively, acting through igdb‐1 independent pathways. Conversely, let‐756/FGF21 appears dispensable for ZA‐induced lifespan and healthspan extension. Because C. elegans lack an endoskeleton, these findings espouse agxt‐2/BAIBA and igdb‐1/FNDC5 as muscle‐intrinsic, bone‐independent mechanisms of bisphosphonate action on improving sarcopenia. Recent rodent work showed that bisphosphonates attenuate denervation atrophy by down‐regulating sirtuin‐3 (SIRT3), 19 a mitochondrially localized NAD+‐dependent deacetylase with important roles in regulating skeletal muscle metabolism. We observed that knocking‐down a C. elegans mitochondrial sirtuin, sir‐2.3, improved life‐ and healthspan, whereas mitochondrial sir‐2.2 KD had no effect, as reported by others. 33 Because sir‐2.3 KD with combined ZA was neither inhibitory nor synergistically beneficial to lifespan or healthspan, this supports the model of bisphosphonate‐mediated mitochondrial sirtuin inhibition as a regulator of mammalian muscle health 19 and now sarcopenia. Loss of sir‐2.2 was, however, dispensable for the positive effects of ZA. Along with improved mitochondrial structure observed herein, growing evidence thus suggests that bisphosphonates act at least partially through mitochondrial mechanisms to lessen the effects of sarcopenia. In conclusion, chronic bisphosphonate administration delays the onset of muscle structural and mitochondrial decline in a C. elegans model of sarcopenia, and this translates to improved animal health across the entire life course. The mechanisms regulating the positive ageing/muscle effects of bisphosphonates appear to be conserved across species and include the mevalonate‐FOXO metabolic axis, mitochondrial sirtuins and muscle‐derived cytokines. Because worms lack an endoskeleton, these mechanisms of bisphosphonates can also be muscle‐intrinsic. By directly implicating bisphosphonates in attenuating the consequences of sarcopenia, this study adds to a growing body of evidence that bisphosphonates are a clinically safe, immediately exploitable anti‐sarcopenia therapeutic.",

Copyright notice ID: 10751425 PMID: 37722921 Abstract Background Age‐related muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous health risk factors and poor quality of life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of bisphosphonates as an anti‐sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear.Methods Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500 μM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates) using a microfluidic chip device. The effects of ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFP‐tagged myofibres or mitochondria at days 0, 4 and 6 post‐adulthood. Mechanisms of ZA‐mediated healthspan extension were determined using combined ZA and targeted RNAi gene knockdown across the life‐course.Results We found 100 nM and 1 μM ZA increased lifespan (P < 0.001) and healthspan [954 ± 53 (100 nM) and 963 ± 48 (1 μM) vs. 834 ± 59% (untreated) population activity AUC, P < 0.05]. 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan (P < 0.0001) but not healthspan (758.9 ± 37 vs. 834 ± 59, P > 0.05), whereas 100 and 500 μM ZA were larval lethal. ZA (1 μM) significantly improved myofibrillar structure on days 4 and 6 post‐adulthood (83 and 71% well‐organized myofibres, respectively, vs. 56 and 34% controls, P < 0.0001) and increased well‐networked mitochondria at day 6 (47 vs. 16% in controls, P < 0.01). Genes required for ZA‐mediated healthspan extension included fdps‐1/FDPS‐1 (278 ± 9 vs. 894 ± 17% population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, respectively, P < 0.0001), daf‐16/FOXO (680 ± 16 vs. 894 ± 17%, P < 0.01) and agxt‐2/BAIBA (531 ± 23 vs. 552 ± 8%, P > 0.05). Life/healthspan was extended through knockdown of igdb‐1/FNDC5 (635 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10% population activity AUC in gene knockdown vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01) and sir‐2.3/SIRT‐4 (586 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05), with no synergistic improvements in ZA co‐treatment vs. knockdown alone [651 ± 12 vs. 635 ± 10% (igdb‐1/FNDC5) and 583 ± 9 vs. 586 ± 10% (sir‐2.3/SIRT‐4), both P > 0.05]. Conversely, let‐756/FGF21 and sir‐2.2/SIRT‐4 were dispensable for ZA‐induced healthspan [630 ± 6 vs. 523 ± 10% population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01 (let‐756/FGF21) and 568 ± 9 vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05 (sir‐2.2/SIRT‐4)].Conclusions Despite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delays Caenorhabditis elegans sarcopenia, which translates to improved neuromuscular function across the life course. Bisphosphonates might, therefore, be an immediately exploitable anti‐sarcopenia therapy.Keywords: Healthspan, Lifespan, Muscle, Sarcopenia, Zoledronic acidIntroduction Age‐related muscle decline, termed ‘sarcopenia’, is classified as a specific disease associated with numerous health risk factors in the elderly, prevalent in at least 10% of older populations 1 and up to 31% as a co‐morbidity. 2 Despite associated annual healthcare costs that run into the billions 3 and significant impacts on individual quality of life and all‐cause mortality, 4 efficacious treatment strategies against sarcopenia remain limited. Physical activity plus targeted nutrition represents the most effective chronic modifiable lifestyle strategy against sarcopenia. 5 However, ageing muscle growth responses to these interventions are sub‐optimal, 6 and certain older individuals can be unable (i.e., through injury and/or access to exercise facilities) or unwilling to participate in regular vigorous activity. Indeed, ~50–70% of those aged 75+ years are physically inactive, 7 meaning complementary pharmaceutical therapies are relevant to a significant portion of the ageing population. Established drugs that modify human muscle ageing are limited, and importantly, many of these drugs display variable therapeutic efficacy and associate with harmful side‐effect profiles that render them inappropriate for long‐term clinical use. For example, rapamycin holds variable efficacy against sarcopenia indices across health and disease 8 but is a potent immunosuppressant 9 unsuitable for chronic use in otherwise healthy humans. Drug identification efforts might instead focus on repurposing existing clinically approved compounds for sarcopenic indications as a realistic, immediately employable approach to therapeutic discovery. Bisphosphonates are chemically stable derivatives of endogenous inorganic pyrophosphate, a metabolite of multiple biosynthetic reactions and present in most tissues, including muscle. 10 Recapitulating the effects of inorganic pyrophosphate, bisphosphonates inhibit calcification and lower hydroxyapatite degradation, 11 while also promoting osteoclast apoptosis to effectively protect against bone loss. As such, bisphosphonates have become a standard clinical strategy against osteoporosis and a variety of skeletal conditions. 12 Yet skeletal muscle health and bone function are inextricably linked: Effective mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle‐bone communication is essential to muscle and bone health, 13 with sarcopenia and osteoporosis often presenting together. 14 Osteoporosis patients prescribed alendronate or pamidronate (the most popular first‐line bisphosphonates) for between 6 months and 3 years display significant increases in muscle strength 15 and total muscle mass. 16 Recent reports on the most potent bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid (ZA), show improved muscle morphology, strength and mass in rodent models of cancer cachexia, 17 Duchenne muscular dystrophy 18 and denervation‐induced muscle atrophy. 19 Retrospective analysis of osteoporosis patients prescribed ZA for 3 years also exhibit significant increases in total lean muscle mass, compared with a loss of muscle mass in untreated controls. 20 In the ageing context, ZA‐treated fruit flies displayed increased survival and improved climbing ability across the life course, suggesting improved neuromuscular ageing. 21 However, the direct anti‐sarcopenic efficacy of ZA has not been established. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an established model of ageing, displaying ordered, progressive age‐related deterioration of multiple tissues, including muscle. 22 C. elegans muscle is also highly morphologically and metabolically similar to human muscle and has high genetic orthology (60–85%) of sub‐muscular systems with people. 23 As with fruit flies, C. elegans are invertebrates that do not possess clear orthologues of mammalian bone secretory factors (‘osteokines’). 24 C. elegans are, therefore, an excellent system for understanding muscle‐specific mechanisms of bisphosphonates, independently of bone‐derived confounders. We thus employed C. elegans as a genomic model of ageing muscle decline to establish the bone‐independent effects, and mechanisms of, bisphosphonates on sarcopenia progression as part of an ageing drug translational pipeline with realistic, near‐term applicability in the clinic.Methods Assessing zoledronic acid effects on Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and healthspan Wild‐type (N2 stain) animals were age synchronized by gravity flotation and ~80 L1 larvae were placed on 33 mm petri dishes (20 L1 per 33 mm plate) containing 2 mL NGM agar [50 mM NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) bacteriological peptone, 1.7% (w/v) agar, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 25 mM KH2PO4 (pH 6), 12.9 μM cholesterol] and seeded with 200 μL of OP50 Escherichia coli bacteria. For ZA treatments, 100 μL of dilute compound (i.e. – 100 μL of 2.3 μM, 23 μM, 230 μM, 2.3 mM and 11.5 μM intermediate dilutions in ddH2O for 100 nM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM and 500 μM concentrations, respectively) were diluted into a 2.3 mL plate volume to achieve the desired final concentration. Control animals were grown on plates seeded with 100 μL of ddH2O to account for any diluting of bacterial lawns. Animals were grown on petri dishes for ~48 h at 20°C to reach young adulthood, then washed off using 3 mL M9 buffer (3 g KH2PO4, 6 g Na2HPO4, 5 g NaCl, 1 mL 1 M MgSO4 per litre) and pooled into 60 cm petri dishes. From these pooled samples, ~70 young adults were collected and loaded into microfluidic chips (Infinity chips; Nemalife Inc., TX) using a 2.5 mL syringe, where the animals remained throughout the rest of the life course. Using the Infinity screening system (Nemalife Inc., TX), on every day of the life course, chips were washed for 90 s with liquid NGM to remove progeny followed by a further 90 s recording for subsequent computational analysis of animal survival and locomotion. Chips were then injected with ~200 μL of 20 mg/mL OP50 supplemented with ZA or ddH2O. Specifically, 980 μL of 20 mg/mL OP50 was supplemented with 20 μL of the required ZA intermediate dilution (i.e., 5 μM, 50 μM and 500 μM intermediates for 100 nM, 1 μM and 10 μM of ZA, respectively) or 20 μL of ddH2O for controls. Chips were then stored in petri dishes at 20°C for the next 24 h with a damp, sterile tissue and parafilmed to avoid the microfluidic arena drying out. Lifespan was performed using the Infinity system screening platform (Nemalife Inc., TX). Specifically, 90 s videos were split into three still image frames (frames 1, 300 and 900), and the Infinity screening system automates a bounding box around every (~70–80) whole animal in the microfluidic chip. Using the Infinity system software (Nemalife Inc., TX), computational coefficients determine animal displacements from outside this bounding box and were used for both lifespan and healthspan analysis. Animals were deemed dead if coefficients were <0.01 (no movement) and alive if values were >0.01. For healthspan analysis, movement rate was employed as one of the most robust measures of animal healthspan. 25 For quantification, animals that obtained coefficients of 0.01–0.40 (i.e., unable to move more than half its body length between subsequent frames) were deemed inactive. Animals with scores of 0.41–1 were classed as ‘active’ animals (i.e., moving half of, or more than its full body‐length in displacement between subsequent frames). Both lifespan and healthspan were determined every day using videos of microfluidic‐housed populations. Average values were taken from movement scores between all three frames. In addition to software automation, each video was manually corrected for any false positives/box deformations that could skew movement scores. Daily mean movement values were converted to area under the curve to denote total population movement scores across the entire life course.Zoledronic acid effects on sarcopenia dystrophic progression with age The anti‐sarcopenic effects of ZA (1 μM) was visualized and quantified using transgenic strains expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)‐tagged sarcomeres (PJ727 strain: jls01 (myo‐3:: GFP, rol‐6 (su1006)); unc‐54::lacZ V) or GFP‐tagged mitochondria (CB5600 strain: ccIs4251 (Pmyo‐3:: Ngfp‐lacZ; Pmyo‐3:: Mtgfp) I; him‐8 (e1489) IV). Strains were grown on 33 mm plates containing 2 mL NGM agar seeded with 200 μL of OP50 ± ZA, as detailed above. Animals were transferred onto fresh plates every 2 days after young adult stage to remove progeny and prevent population starvation. To image sarcomere and mitochondrial structure, ~30 animals per condition/time point were picked into 20 μL of M9 buffer on a microscope slide (VWR Superfrost, UK) with a cover slip placed on top and imaged immediately using an upright epiflourescent microscope (BX43, Olympus Life Science, UK). Images of the body wall muscles were captured from the head and tail region of each animal (avoiding the mid‐animal/vulva region that exhibits frequent egg‐laying induced tissue disruption) using an Orca‐spark camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) set to 50 ms exposure rate and a gain of 3.4 dB for all acquired images. Approximately 10 individual muscle cells were scored per animal equating to ~300 muscle cells per condition/replicate and scored as either well networked, moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscle sarcomere or mitochondria structures as previously described 26 (see Figure S1 for representative images of each class of structural defect). Analysis was carried out in ImageJ, and the number of well networked, moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscles were expressed as a percentage of total muscle cells visible and analysed within each animal.RNA interference and combined zoledronic acid treatments for lifespan and healthspan analysis The effects of RNAi treatments on animal lifespan/healthspan were determined using bacterial feeding vectors and performed in the Infinity screening system, as described above. All bacterial lawns expressing double‐stranded RNA were grown from the MRC Ahringer Library of bacterial clones to target (fdps‐1: R06C1.2; daf‐16: R13H8.1; agxt‐2: T09B4.8; igdb‐1: T04A11.3; let‐756: C05D11.4; sir‐2.2: F46G10.7: sir‐2.3: F46G10.3). Each clone was streaked onto LB plates supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and 25 μg/mL carbenicillin and grown overnight at 37°C. Single colonies were then picked into sterile LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and grown for 16 h with shaking at 180 rpm at 37°C. After 16 h incubation, 0.4 mM isopropyl β‐d‐1‐thiogalactopyranoside was added for RNAi induction, with further shaking at 180 rpm for 2 h at 37°C as described previously. 27 After 18 h incubation, tubes were spun at 3000 g for 10 min to obtain bacterial pellets. Liquid NGM was added to each bacterial pellet to reach a final bacteria concentration of 20 mg/mL, adding isopropyl β‐d‐1‐thiogalactopyranoside to a final 1 mM concentration before use. For combined ZA treatments, the same bacterial preparation was performed, but with 20 μL of dilute ZA supplemented to 1 mL of 20 mg/mL OP50 in NGM for a final concentration of 1 μM. On every day of the life course, after washing/recording using the Infinity system as detailed above, ~200 μL of RNAi bacteria ± ZA (1 μM) was injected into the microfluidic chips before storing in petri dishes at 20°C for 24 h until washing/refeeding the next day (with drug dilution/control). All bacteria and drug solutions were prepared fresh daily until cessation of life. RNAi experiments were always conducted alongside empty vector controls (PL4440).Statistics Lifespan analysis was performed using Kaplan–Meier curves assessed by the log‐rank (Mantell–Cox) test. Multiple comparisons of survival curves were performed manually using the Bonferroni‐corrected threshold. For movement rate, area under the curve (AUC) was performed on mean movement values across each day of adulthood (averages taken from across all three frames). AUC values and standard deviations obtained from replicate screens were then assessed by one‐way ANOVA in GraphPad, Prism. Both mitochondrial and sarcomere quantification were analysed by two‐way ANOVA using the percentage classification score from individual animals across biological repeats. All statistics were performed in GraphPad, Prism (San Diego, California USA).Results Zoledronic acid extends Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and healthspan Higher ZA concentrations (500 and 100 μM) were larval lethal, and 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan (median survival = 11 vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001; Figure 1A) without significantly impairing healthspan (animal movement AUC = 758.9 ± 37.08 vs. 833.9 ± 59.91 for controls, P > 0.05; Figure 1A). Conversely, lifespan extension was observed with lower ZA doses of 1 μM (median survival = 16 days, P < 0.001; Figure 1B) and 100 nM (median survival = 16 days, P < 0.0001; Figure 1C). These lifespan‐promoting ZA doses also associated with healthspan extension at 1 μM (AUC = 963.1 ± 48.74, P < 0.05; Figure 1B) and 100 nM (AUC = 953.8 ± 53.77, P < 0.05; Figure 1C) treatments. Additionally, significant movement decline onset became apparent in day 9 control animals (P > 0.01 vs. day 1 adults), which was upheld across all ZA treatment doses at this single time point (+22.2, +31.8 and +17.6% population activity on day 9 vs. untreated controls in 10 μM, 1 μM and 100 nM, respectively). ZA thus acts dose‐dependently to augment animal longevity and health across the life course. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Zoledronic acid acts dose‐dependently to improve C. elegans survival and movement capacity. (A) Animals exposed to 10 μM zoledronic acid (ZA) exhibit significant declines in survivability (top) to untreated controls (median survival: 10 vs. 14 days, respectively, P < 0.0001), however, show no significant impairment in movement capacity (bottom) across whole life (P = 0.208). Conversely, both 1 μM (B) and 100 nM (C) were beneficial to animal survival (1 μM median survival: 16 days, P < 0.001; 100 nM: 16 days, P < 0.0001), with paralleled improvements in movement capacity throughout the life course. (D) Graphical overlay of lifespan curves from each ZA concentration versus untreated controls. (E) Overlay of life course movement rates between ZA doses displayed as % mean AUC. Data are mean + SEM of three biological repeats, with ~225–300 animals per condition/time point. Asterisks denote significance to N2 controls. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Zoledronic acid delays age‐related declines in muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial integrity To understand the effects of ZA on progressive sarcomere dystrophy across age, transgenic C. elegans expressing GFP‐tagged myosin were treated with 1 μM ZA. Corroborating previous reports on the temporal age‐related loss of sub‐cellular muscle structures, 22 untreated wild‐type animals displayed a significant −35.6% decline in organized myofibrillar structure by day 4 post‐adulthood (P < 0.0001; Figure 2A,B), which worsened to −58.0% by day 6 post‐adulthood (P < 0.0001). ZA delayed loss of organized sarcomeres until day 6 post‐adulthood (−15.6%, P < 0.01), and significantly increased the number of muscle cells displaying organized sarcomeres versus untreated controls at days 4 (83.9% vs. 54.4%) and 6 (71.1% vs. 31.4%) post‐adulthood (both P < 0.0001, Figure 2A,B). ZA also decreased muscle cells categorized as ‘moderately disorganized’ on days 4 (17.0% vs. 38.2%, P < 0.01) and 6 (27.6 vs. 53.4%, P < 0.0001) post‐adulthood and reduced the number of ‘severely disorganized’ muscles on day 6 post‐adulthood (1.8% vs. 13.1%, P < 0.0001). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Zoledronic acid attenuates age‐related loss of sarcomere integrity. (A) Onset of myofibrillar disorganization occurred at days 4 and 6 post‐adulthood in untreated animals and was significantly attenuated in zoledronic treated (1 μM) animals (all P < 0.0001). (B) Representative images of untreated (top) and zoledronic acid treated (bottom) myofibres. Data are means of two biological repeats, with ~50–60 animals per condition/time point, and images taken from head and tail regions of each animal (~120–150 muscle cells per condition/time point). Asterisks denote significance between zoledronic acid and untreated animals within each structural category (** P < 0.01, **** P < 0.0001). ‘¥’ denotes significant loss of myofibrillar structure for within‐condition comparisons versus day 0 values (¥¥¥ P < 0.001, ¥¥¥¥ P < 0.0001).We next examined the effects of ZA on mitochondrial integrity, given the strong associations of mitochondrial structure and function with ageing animal health. In line with previous wild‐type ageing studies, 22 loss of networked mitochondria occurred by day 2 post‐adulthood (Figure S2), which progressively worsened at day 4 (−42.6%, P < 0.0001) and day 6 post‐adulthood (−67.0%, P < 0.0001; Figure 3A,B). ZA treatment did not delay the onset of well‐networked mitochondria loss at day 2 (Figure S2) or day 4 post‐adulthood (51.8%, P < 0.0001). However, ZA prevented progressive mitochondrial fragmentation at day 6 post‐adulthood (46.7%, P > 0.05 vs. day 4), which was also significantly higher than in untreated animals (46.7 vs. 16.1%, P < 0.01). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Zoledronic acid attenuates age‐related loss of muscle mitochondrial structure. (A) Untreated animals displayed progressive declines in well‐networked mitochondria across days 0, 4 and 6 post‐adulthood (for each time point, P < 0.0001). Zoledronic acid treatment (1 μM) animals saw a similar decline by day 4; however, no further decline was evident by day 6 post‐adulthood, showing significant improvement when compared to untreated animals at this time point (P < 0.01). (B) Representative images of untreated (top) and zoledronic acid treated (bottom) data are means of two biological repeats with ~50–60 animals per condition/time point, and images taken from head and tail regions of each animal (~120–150 muscle cells per condition/time point). Asterisks denote significance between zoledronic acid and untreated animals within each structural category (** P < 0.01). ‘¥’ denotes significant loss of myofibrillar structure for within‐condition comparisons versus day 0 values (¥¥¥¥ P < 0.0001).Zoledronic acid‐mediated healthspan extension acts through multiple mechanisms The lifespan extending effects of ZA have previously been attributed to the mevalonate cholesterol/isoprenoid lipid biosynthesis pathway and the FOXO family of transcription factors, 21 but their role in ZA‐induced healthspan extension is unknown. RNAi knockdown (KD) of fdps‐1, an orthologue of farnesyl diphosphate synthetase involved in the biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphate intermediates from mevalonate, impaired survival (median survival = 6 vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001) and healthspan (AUC = 287 ± 9 vs. 894 ± 17% population activity for controls, P < 0.0001), which was not improved by co‐treatment with 1 μM ZA (Figure 4A). Similarly, RNAi KD of the daf‐16/FOXO stress response pathway impaired survivability (median survival = 12 vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001) and healthspan (AUC = 680.5 ± 23.6 vs. 894.2 ± 17.4 for empty vector, P < 0.01) and prevented the beneficial effects of ZA treatment (Figure 4B). Figure 4. Open in a new tab FDPS, FOXO and BAIBA orthologues are required for the healthspan effects of zoledronic acid. Knockdown of FDPS‐1 (FDPS) with ZA co‐treatment (1 μM) prevents ZA mediated lifespan (top) and healthspan (bottom) extension (A). Similarly, knockdown of daf‐16 (FOXO) decreases survival and movement, with no improvement with ZA co‐treatment (B). The conserved bone‐muscle ortholog agxt‐2 (BAIBA) is required for ZA mediated improvement in survival and movement (C). Data are mean + SD of two repeats, with ~140–160 animals per condition/time point. Asterisks denote significance to empty vector. ** P < 0.01, **** P < 0.0001.The FOXO pathway is a global stress response system, inducible by a wide array of stimuli and a generic transcription factor regulating cellular responses across multiple drug families 28 that integrates multiple upstream signals to influence worm ageing. 29 Alternative, muscle‐centric mechanisms thus also likely contribute to the healthspan benefits of ZA. To probe potential muscle‐derived mechanisms of ZA‐induced healthspan extension, we examined the role of three putative myokines that exhibit altered expression across age and implicated in muscle‐bone crosstalk: agxt‐2/BAIBA, igdb‐1/FNDC5 and let‐756/FGF21. 24 Lifespan and healthspan were unaffected by KD of agxt‐2/BAIBA (β‐aminoisobutyric acid), a muscle‐borne bone protective factor 30 ; however, combined agxt‐2 KD with ZA treatment was unable to confer life/healthspan extension (Figure 4C). Conversely, the inhibition of igdb‐1 extended lifespan (median survival = 11 vs. 7 days for controls, P < 0.05) and improved healthspan (AUC = 634.5 ± 10.5 vs. 523 ± 10.0 for controls, P < 0.01), with similar life/healthspan extension observed upon co‐treatment with ZA (Figure 5A). Additionally, let‐756 appears dispensable for ZA‐induced healthspan effects: KD alone caused no significant alterations in survival or movement, whereas increased lifespan and healthspan was retained with combined let‐756 KD and ZA treatment (Figure 5B). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Genes either dispensable, or that associate with ZA's healthspan effects. Knockdown of igdb‐1 (FNDC5) significantly increased survival and healthspan, where ZA co‐treatment (1 μM) was not synergistic, but displayed similar improvements in lifespan (top) and healthspan (bottom) suggesting igdb‐1 might exhibit ZA‐induced downregulation (A), or act independently to increase healthspan. Conversely, let‐756 (FGF21, B) is dispensable for both lifespan and healthspan extension with ZA. The mitochondrial sirtuins displayed opposing effects; sir‐2.2 (SIRT‐4, C) is dispensable for ZA's healthspan effects, whereas sir‐2.3 (SIRT‐4) knockdown increased survival and movement (D), as did ZA co‐treatment, suggesting sir‐2.3 downregulation might mediate ZA's healthspan effects. Asterisks denote significance to empty vector controls. *P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, **** P < 0.0001. ‘#’ denote significance between ZA co‐treatments and gene inhibition alone. # P < 0.05, ## P < 0.01.Recent rodent work shows bisphosphonates attenuate denervation‐induced muscle atrophy via downregulation of sirtuin‐3 (SIRT3), one of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)‐dependent deacetylase family members. 19 Because SIRT3 is primarily mitochondrially localized, 31 we examined the role of two C. elegans mitochondrial sirtuins, sir‐2.2 and sir‐2.3, 32 for their role in ZA‐mediated lifespan and healthspan extension. Reinforcing a mitochondrial role of sir‐2.2 and sir‐2.3, RNAi KD of each gene caused increased mitochondrial fragmentation at day 0 post‐adulthood (Figure S3). While sir‐2.2 KD did not alter animal survival or healthspan, loss of sir‐2.2 blocked ZA's life extending properties but ZA‐induced healthspan extension remained (Figure 5C). Additionally, and in line with previous reports in C. elegans , 33 we find that knockdown of sir‐2.3 extends lifespan (Figure 5D) and healthspan (Figure 5H), which remains with combined ZA treatment but is not synergistically beneficial.Discussion Despite the socio‐economic implications, treatment options for sarcopenia remain mostly limited to modifiable lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, which are incompletely effective. 34 Complementary drug interventions would, therefore, benefit a significant portion of the ageing population, yet effectual compounds that are safe for long‐term use remain elusive. Identifying drugs in clinical use and repurposing for sarcopenia indications could provide immediately exploitable pharmaceuticals for the general population. Bisphosphonates have been used to safely treat osteoporosis for decades. 35 Here, we report that bisphosphonates (ZA) extend C. elegans lifespan and healthspan, which associates with delayed onset of muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial decline. While general stress response pathways, such as FOXO, regulate these positive healthspan responses to ZA, we establish muscle‐centric myokines (agxt‐2 and igdb‐1) and mitochondrial sirtuin (sir‐2.3) as previously unknown regulators of bisphosphonate effects on ageing muscle health. Growing pre‐clinical 17 , 18 , 19 and human 20 evidence suggest that bisphosphonates not only preserve bone integrity but also exert muscle promoting effects across a variety of conditions. A recent study in fruit flies suggest similar effects might extend to the ageing process, where bisphosphonate treatment prolonged lifespan and animal healthspan. 21 We provide the first in vivo evidence for a direct role of chronic bisphosphonate administration in delaying age‐related muscle structural decline. Because ageing muscle architectural alterations are a hallmark of human sarcopenia that relate to lowered motility in animals, 22 bisphosphonate‐mediated sarcomere preservation could translate to reduced sarcopenia in higher animals and people. ZA also attenuated ageing muscle mitochondrial decline. Mitochondrial health is strongly linked with sarcopenic progression across species and mitochondrial structure corresponds with oxidative function 23 ; therefore, bisphosphonates might hold dual, and possibly interrelated, efficacy for maintaining muscle metabolic health and sarcomeric integrity. While we assessed animals at, and beyond, the point of onset of age‐related sub‐muscular decline, the anti‐sarcopenic efficacy of bisphosphonates into very old age remains to be determined. Nonetheless, using our microfluidic healthspan device 27 and animal movement rate as a robust index of health, 25 we demonstrate that early‐ to mid‐life muscle preservation translates to improved animal health across the entire life course. Bisphosphonates thus represent a promising strategy for maintaining muscle, and whole animal health into older age. In fruit flies, bisphosphonates increase lifespan through inhibition of the mevalonate metabolic pathway and downstream FOXO activation. 21 We extend this by implicating the mevalonate‐FOXO system as necessary for bisphosphonate‐mediated health improvements across the life course. The sterol and non‐sterol isoprenoids synthesized via mevalonate localize to plasma membranes and influence several vital cellular processes, the dysfunction of which associate with wide ranging pathologies including cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. 36 Our data suggest that sarcopenia can be added to this list, whereby knockdown of a key enzyme in mevalonate metabolism, farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (fdps‐1), allows normal larval development to adulthood and young adult (day 1) movement rates, corroborating earlier reports of normal L4 larvae muscle architecture upon fdps‐1 RNAi. 37 Thereafter, downregulation of fdps‐1 causes rapid neuromuscular functional decline (i.e., animal motility), likely indicative of accelerated sarcopenia. Because zoledronic acid is unable to improve lifespan and healthspan in fdps‐1 or daf‐16 knockdown animals, the mevalonate‐FOXO pathway is strongly implicated in the ageing neuromuscular health benefits of bisphosphonates. Bi‐directional communication between muscle and bone has long been established, including mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle‐bone signalling. 13 , 24 We, therefore, examined the mechanistic role of three putative muscle‐derived signalling factors (‘myokines’) involved in muscle‐bone crosstalk that exhibit altered age‐related function. 24 Of these, agxt‐2/BAIBA was necessary for the positive healthspan effects of ZA, while agxt‐2 KD alone was not harmful to animal longevity or health. BAIBA promotes insulin sensitivity, anti‐inflammation 38 and osteocyte survival in mice, 39 and its expression does not decline with age 39 ; thus, BAIBA‐mediated muscle/health benefits of bisphosphonates would be anticipated to remain in older age. Knockdown of igdb‐1/FNDC5 extended worm lifespan and healthspan, countering human studies implicating low circulating FNDC5 as a sarcopenia biomarker. 40 The healthspan effects of igdb‐1 KD were also comparable with ZA co‐treatment. This inability of idgb‐1 KD to neither ablate nor synergistically augment the positive effects of ZA could be interpreted as ZA exerting healthspan‐promoting inhibitory effects on igdb‐1 or, alternatively, acting through igdb‐1 independent pathways. Conversely, let‐756/FGF21 appears dispensable for ZA‐induced lifespan and healthspan extension. Because C. elegans lack an endoskeleton, these findings espouse agxt‐2/BAIBA and igdb‐1/FNDC5 as muscle‐intrinsic, bone‐independent mechanisms of bisphosphonate action on improving sarcopenia. Recent rodent work showed that bisphosphonates attenuate denervation atrophy by down‐regulating sirtuin‐3 (SIRT3), 19 a mitochondrially localized NAD+‐dependent deacetylase with important roles in regulating skeletal muscle metabolism. We observed that knocking‐down a C. elegans mitochondrial sirtuin, sir‐2.3, improved life‐ and healthspan, whereas mitochondrial sir‐2.2 KD had no effect, as reported by others. 33 Because sir‐2.3 KD with combined ZA was neither inhibitory nor synergistically beneficial to lifespan or healthspan, this supports the model of bisphosphonate‐mediated mitochondrial sirtuin inhibition as a regulator of mammalian muscle health 19 and now sarcopenia. Loss of sir‐2.2 was, however, dispensable for the positive effects of ZA. Along with improved mitochondrial structure observed herein, growing evidence thus suggests that bisphosphonates act at least partially through mitochondrial mechanisms to lessen the effects of sarcopenia. In conclusion, chronic bisphosphonate administration delays the onset of muscle structural and mitochondrial decline in a C. elegans model of sarcopenia, and this translates to improved animal health across the entire life course. The mechanisms regulating the positive ageing/muscle effects of bisphosphonates appear to be conserved across species and include the mevalonate‐FOXO metabolic axis, mitochondrial sirtuins and muscle‐derived cytokines. Because worms lack an endoskeleton, these mechanisms of bisphosphonates can also be muscle‐intrinsic. By directly implicating bisphosphonates in attenuating the consequences of sarcopenia, this study adds to a growing body of evidence that bisphosphonates are a clinically safe, immediately exploitable anti‐sarcopenia therapeutic.Conflict of interest The authors declare no competing interests.Supporting information Figure S1.
