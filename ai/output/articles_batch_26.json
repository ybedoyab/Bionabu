Here, we applied 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. During reambulation, individual mice regained bone and muscle at different rates. Across mice, changes in muscle and trabecular/cortical bone were not correlated to each other during unloading or reambulation. For unloading, we found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for muscle area and five QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive muscle and cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between muscle and trabecular QTLs). The low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un)loading may need to be reassessed.

    "introduction": "Introduction The concept of a muscle-bone unit tuned to the magnitude of contractile forces has intuitive appeal as reflected by Darcy Thompson in 1917[1]: “Muscle and bone … are inseparably associated and connected; they are moulded one with another; they come into being together, and act and react together.” Indeed, strong correlations between muscle mass and bone mass have been found in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies, particularly over the course of growth and development[2], leading many to believe that mechanically adaptive changes in bone are initiated primarily by changes in muscle activity. Both cortical and trabecular bone have been included in muscle-bone correlations but it is unclear which type of bone is more highly associated with muscle strength[3-5]. Inherently, correlations used in these studies cannot infer causality and, alternatively, may reflect an indirect association via a shared underlying molecular signal[6]. Exercise induces a highly site-specific mechanical environment in the skeleton[7], yet high correlations between muscle strength and bone mineral density (BMD) span distant sites in the skeleton[8]. Thus, an association between muscle and bone may be more global than peak muscle forces locally altering bone (re)modeling at the specific anatomical site at which they act. Furthermore, if muscle was a causal factor during bone development, then increased muscle mass and muscle strength should precede the majority of bone mineral accrual. While such a sequential relationship has been observed using two-dimensional DXA[9], three-dimensional CT data show that bone mineral accrual may cease before peak muscle strength is reached[10]. At the other end of the spectrum, age-related sarcopenia reduces muscle loading of bone and, therefore, should induce bone loss. Contrary to the proposed functional muscle-bone relationship, substantial bone loss can precede equivalently detectable losses in muscle by nearly a decade[11]. These examples demonstrate inconsistencies in the paradigm of a muscle-bone unit that is regulated by the force exerted in skeletal muscle. The drastic changes in the mechanical environment associated with unloading and reambulation of the musculoskeleton during spaceflight, bedrest, or injury/disease provide a model system to further test muscle-bone interactions. Reflecting the high sensitivity of the musculoskeleton to mechanical signals, unloading causes both sarcopenia and osteopenia in humans and animal models[12,13] while reambulation recovers, at least in part, these losses[14-16]. Further, differences in genetic make-up between individuals, humans or mice[17,18], have been shown to greatly influence the magnitude of the skeletal response to unloading and reambulation, providing an opportunity to relate intra-individual differences in musculoskeletal adaptation across a wide phenotypic range. Muscle-bone relations can be tested at different levels – from molecules to organs. While molecular interactions have recently received considerable attention[19,20], much less is known about the genes that determine differences in musculoskeletal sensitivity to mechanical signals based on an individual’s genetic make-up. For trabecular bone, we have identified specific regions on chromosomes that harbor regulatory genes (quantitative trait loci or QTL) explaining the variability in bone’s response to unloading and reambulation across a genetically heterogeneous mouse population[18]. QTLs that regulate the susceptibility of cortical bone and muscle to unloading and subsequent reambulation are yet to be identified. Comparing regulatory genetic regions for the mechano-response between muscle and bone would afford insight into the muscle-bone unit at the genetic level. In an effort to test muscle-bone interactions at the tissue and genetic level, we used more than 350 adult mice from a genetically heterogeneous mouse population that display a large range of trabecular responses to unloading and reambulation[15,18,21]. Changes in muscle and cortical bone morphology during 3wk of unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation were quantified and associated with each other to test the hypothesis that those individuals who show the greatest muscular changes will coincide with those who show the greatest changes in bone. At the genetic level, the hypothesis that unloading/reambulation QTLs are similar between muscle and bone was considered.",
    "methods": "Methods Experimental design The study design has been described previously and data for trabecular bone have been reported[15,18,21]. Briefly, to produce a genetically heterogeneous mouse population with large individual differences in mechanosensitivity, the parental inbred mouse strains of female BALB/cByJ[22] and male C3H/HeJ[23] were double-crossed to produce the F2 offspring. At 4mo of age, female F2 mice were exposed to 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation. The unloading period was completed by 464 mice. A total of 352 mice completed both unloading and reambulation protocols. The length of the reambulation period was the same as the unloading period to capture the initial, mechanically induced response to the re-introduction of weightbearing and to minimize the influence of age-related changes in musculo-skeletal phenotypes. Muscle and bone data were also obtained from 25 normally ambulating F2 mice (n=25) that served as age-matched controlsChanges in muscle and cortical bone assessed by in vivo µCT The femoral diaphysis of both legs was scanned by in vivo micro-computed tomography (µCT) at baseline, after the unloading period, and after the reambulation period scans (VivaCT 40, Scanco Medical, SUI). An isotropic voxel size of 17.5µm with an integration time of 380ms, 1000 projections, 55kV and 109µA were used. There is no evidence that radiation at the prescribed levels influenced the tissue level response[18]. The analyzed region for mid-diaphyseal cortical bone was determined as a 2.1mm long region in axial direction centered at 50% of femoral length. Mid-diaphyseal cortical bone morphology was evaluated for cortical area (Ct.Ar), marrow area (Ma.Ar), and tissue mineral density (TMD) with sigma, support, and threshold values of 0.6, 1, and 220. The combined cross-sectional area of muscle groups (Mu.Ar) surrounding a 700µm long region centered at 50% of femoral length was determined using sigma, support and threshold values of 0.9, 1, and 71 (Figure 1). Total cortical area was subtracted from the total muscle area. For each mouse, any given muscle and bone µCT index was determined for the left and right leg and averaged into a single value. The first 81 mice were not included in the muscle unloading analysis because we used a µCT ROI for these mice that did not capture the entire muscle group, resulting in n=384 for changes in Mu.Ar during unloading (vs n=464 for cortical variables). Sample size for reambulation was identical for all variables. Figure 1. Open in a new tab A) Scout-view of the femur taken with the in vivo μCT scanner.

B) Single μCT slice within the region in which muscle and cortical bone properties were determined. The white solid contour line surrounds the ROI of muscle tissue analyzed in a single leg. Total cortical bone area was excluded from the muscle area. For each mouse, the left and right leg were analyzed and averaged.Genotyping and QTL mapping Genotyping and QTL mapping for this set of mice has been described previously[18,21]. Briefly, DNA was prepared from tail tips and submitted to KBiosciences (U.K.) for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. SNPs were spaced at approximately 1MB intervals across the genome with 89 SNPs known to be polymorphic between the BALB/cByJ and C3H/HeJ inbred strains. Phenotypes pertaining to longitudinal changes during unloading, and reambulation were included in the QTL analysis performed via the statistical software R/QTL[24]. For genome-wide one-dimensional scans, pseudo-markers were generated at 2cM spacing for each chromosome and scans were performed using 256 imputations[25]. The thresholds for QTL detection were computed from one thousand permutations[26]. Four standard thresholds[27], 1%, 5%, 10%, and 63%, were used to identify a range of QTLs from strong (1% threshold) to suggestive (63% threshold). For genome-wide two-dimensional scans, pairwise scans were performed at 2cM spacing and LOD scores were calculated. QTL and possible QTL*QTL interactions identified from a single and pair wise QTL scan were fit into multiple regression models, facilitating the estimation of the variations of the phenotype in the models. P-values for terms in the multiple regression model were determined. Terms were dropped sequentially until all of the terms in the model were significant at the 1% level for main QTL effects and at 0.1% for interaction effects.Statistical phenotype analysis Data were presented as means and standard deviations. To avoid outliers, minimal and maximal changes in any given phenotype during unloading and reambulation were reported as the 5th (min) and 95th percentile (max) of the experimental population. Paired t-tests compared individual phenotypes between two different time points. Unpaired t-tests compared temporal changes (0-3wk or 3-6wk) in all muscle and bone outcome variables between experimental and age-matched control mice. When Levene’s test of Equality of Variances indicated that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was not met, the t-test was corrected for accordingly. Changes in individual muscle and bone variables were associated with each other within and between the two experimental phases. Changes in body mass were also associated with µCT variables during unloading and reambulation. Coefficients of determination and their corresponding p-values were reported. For all tests, statistical significance was set at p=0.05. IBM SPSS Statistics (version 22) was used.",
    "results": "Results As expected from the F2 mouse population bred specifically for a large range in musculoskeletal mechanosensitivity, the response of both tissues to the two experimental regimes varied greatly across individuals. Body mass changes in these mice during unloading and reambulation[18] were not correlated with changes in any of the phenotype outcome variables (all R2<0.05). Unloading - Muscle During 3wk of unloading, muscle area (Mu.Ar) declined (p<0.001) on average by 9% (min: -26%, max: 9%) while in normally ambulating age-matched controls, Mu.Ar did not change significantly (mean: 2% min: -14%, max: 19%) over the same period (Table 1, Figure 2). The relative (net) mean difference of 11% (p<0.001) between the two groups was significant (i.e., mean loss in experimental mice during unloading was different from the non-significant mean gain in normal control mice). One QTL was identified on chromosome 5 for the loss in muscle cross-sectional area during unloading, explaining 5% (p<0.001) of the variability between mice (Figure 3). Table 1.

Peaks crossing the black, red, green, and blue lines denote QTLs at significance thresholds of 63%, 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.Reambulation - Muscle During reambulation, experimental mice averaged a 9% increase (p<0.001) in muscle area (min: -8% max: 31%), a change that was different (p<0.001) from the lack of growth in muscle area in age-matched controls (mean: 0%, min: -7%, max: 18%; Table 1, Figure 2). In experimental mice, individuals that experienced the greatest losses in muscle area during unloading were moderately correlated with those that experienced the greatest gain during reambulation (R2=0.32, p<0.0001; Figure 4). Two suggestive QTLs for the gain of muscle area upon reambulation were identified on chromosomal loci that differed from QTL identified for unloading (Figure 3). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Changes in muscle area during hindlimb unloading (HLU, horizontal axis) associated with changes in muscle area experienced during reambulation (RA, vertical axis).Unloading - Bone Unloading of the hindlimb reduced (p=0.04) cortical bone in the femoral diaphysis on average by 0.5% (min: -6%, max: 12%) while age matched controls gained 3% (p<0.001) over the same time period (min: 1%, max: 5%; Table 1, Figure 2). Changes in the two groups were different from each other (p<0.001) with a net difference of 4%. Bone marrow area increased (p<0.001) on average by 6% (min: -12% max: 16%) during unloading, a response that was significantly different (p<0.001) from age matched controls in which Ma.Ar did not change significantly (min: -2%, max: 5%; Table 1, Figure 2). Tissue mineral density increased (p=0.03) on average by 0.3% (min: -3%, max: 2%) during unloading, a smaller (p<0.001) increase than in age matched controls which gained 1% (p<0.001) over the same time period (min: 0%, max: 2%; Table 1, Figure 2). For changes in cortical bone area, three QTLs on chromosomes 9, 18, and 19 were determined for unloading (Figure 3), together accounting for 10% (p<0.001) of the variability in HLU induced change in Ct.Ar. QTLs responsible for the magnitude of change in bone marrow area during unloading were revealed on chromosomes 2 and 9, accounting for 10% (p<0.001) of the observed variability in this variable. No QTLs were found for changes in tissue mineral density during unloading.Reambulation - Bone During reambulation, increases in cortical area seen in experimental mice (mean: 4%, min: -1%, max: 9%, p<0.001) matched those of age matched controls (mean: 4%, min: 2%, max: 6%, p<0.001; Table 1, Figure 2). During the reambulation period, marrow area decreased to a greater (p=0.04) degree in experimental mice (mean: -2%, min: -11%, max: 8%, p<0.001) than in controls (mean: -1%, min: -3%, max: 4%, p=0.05). The increase (p<0001) in tissue mineral density was 1% both in experimentals (min: -1%, max: 3%) and controls (min: 0%, max: 3%) during this time period without a significant between-group difference. Only weak correlations were found between unloading and reambulation for changes in any given variable; R2 values for CT.Ar, Ma.Ar, and TMD amounted to 8%, 16%, and 7%, respectively (all p<0.0001). For reambulation and similar to muscle, no significant QTLs were identified for any of the three bone variables. For Ct.Ar, we found two suggestive QTLs (Chr 5 and 17) and for Ma.Ar, one suggested QTL was found (Chr 8) for reambulation (Figure 3).Associations between muscle and bone Both during unloading and reambulation, those mice displaying the greatest changes in muscle area did not coincide with those that showed the greatest changes in cortical bone; associations between changes in muscle area and cortical area resulted in R2-values of less than 10% (Figure 5). Coefficients of determination for changes in muscle area vs either marrow area or TMD were similarly low (data not shown). Extending the correlations between muscle and cortical bone to changes in trabecular bone previously reported from the metaphysis of the distal femur[18] produced similar results; R2-values for changes in muscle area versus changes in trabecular bone volume fraction yielded 11% for the unloading phase and less than 1% for the reambulation phase (Figure 5). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Associations between changes in muscle area vs cortical area (a. & c.) and changes in muscle area vs marrow area (b. & d.) for unloading (a. & b.) and reambulation (c. & d.).For unloading, the QTL for changes in muscle area on chromosome 5 did not overlap with those identified for cortical indices but shared common regions with previously determined trabecular QTLs from the same bones[18] for changes in three out of six trabecular indices; normalized bone surface, trabecular thickness, and trabecular tissue mineral density. For reambulation, the two suggestive QTLs for changes in muscle area on chromosomes 2 and 19 did not overlap with (suggestive) QTLs identified for cortical indices but with trabecular QTLs for changes in one out of six trabecular indices (trabecular number).",
    "discussion": "Discussion We tested for co-regulation between changes in muscle and bone during removal and reapplication of weightbearing activities with the rationale that if muscle size controls bone size, we should observe robust correlations in the response of the two tissues. In contrast to this hypothesis, the magnitude of the response of the two tissues to unloading and reambulation was not correlated across a genetically heterogeneous mouse population. This lack of coordination between muscle and bone at the tissue level was somewhat similar at the genetic level. The strong QTL for changes in muscle area during unloading on chromosome 5 did not overlap with any QTLs for changes in cortical bone properties but shared a common region for some trabecular properties. While these data emphasize the strong influence of genetic variations on the response of both skeletal muscle and bone, the low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response, are inconsistent with the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-regulates its size during mechanical challenges. Several limitations should be considered when interpreting results from this study. First, we did not measure changes in muscle strength but muscle cross-sectional area as a surrogate measure of strength is well accepted in clinical and animal studies[28-32]. Second, we chose the composite cross-sectional muscle area of several individual muscles as we assumed that the forces exerted by these muscles are primarily responsible for inducing bone strains in the diaphysis (and metaphysis) of the mouse femur and because the µCT images did not allow for separation into distinct muscle groups. Third, we observed musculoskeletal changes in unloading and reambulation over a 3wk period each, a duration that significantly altered musculo-skeletal variables at the mouse femur during both unloading and reambulation but it is conceivable that time periods of different length would influence our results and conclusions. Using the initial adaptive changes in both tissues upon application of a new mechanical environment ostensibly provided the largest signals for the correlations and should have also minimized the limitation that changes in muscle and bone were quantified simultaneously, rather than sequentially with muscle measurements preceding bone measurements. Lastly, QTL studies have many strengths including the absence of assumptions regarding genes and molecular pathways giving rise to the trait of interest. Conversely, the identification of causative genes from the identified QTLs typically requires substantial effort[33] as QTLs can contain several hundred candidate genes[18] and we are currently pursuing a combined bioinformatic/transgenic mouse approach towards this critical goal[34]. There was a relatively small number of mice that added muscle and/or bone tissue during unloading. While we don’t know the reason for this pattern, it is conceivable that specific combinations of polymorphisms caused the tissue response of these mice go into the opposite direction from what we would have expected. This is plausible because by breeding a F2 population, it is likely that some mice will have a phenotype well beyond the expected boundaries set by the two progenitor inbred strains[35]. Because of the small number of mice displaying the opposite response pattern, no underlying QTLs could be determined. Inherently, it is also possible that noise in the data measurements contributed to this phenomenon. If it was true that combinations of polymorphisms cannot only prevent the catabolic response associated with unloading but can even produce a mild anabolic response, the identification of these polymorphisms may give rise to novel countermeasures. Muscle-bone interactions have recently received considerable attention[6,19,36]. Most of the interest has focused on molecular pathways by which muscle and bone can communicate with each other, rather than on how bone perceives forces produced by muscle. For instance, novel myokines have been identified that may either promote catabolism or anabolism in bone[20,37]. We did not measure (changes in) biochemical factors here but the low correlations between muscle and bone at the genetic and tissue level may indicate that molecular cross-tissue communication is not necessarily driven by changes in muscle size. Excellent relations between muscle and bone quantity have been reported in a number of species including mice and humans[38]. Many of these studies were cross-sectional in nature, precluding mechanistic inferences. Some longitudinal studies in mice have proposed functional relationships between changes in bone and muscle during (un)loading[39-41] but they were limited to temporal relations in a single inbred strain of mice. That our longitudinal study, taking advantage of a large sample of mice with greatly different mechano-responsivities, was not able to provide evidence for a mechanism by which changes in muscle size modulate changes in bone size should not be entirely surprising. Astronauts suffer from sarcopenia and ostepenia in space but the temporal patterns of muscle and bone loss are not suggestive of a causal relation; similar to paraplegia and bedrest, bone loss continues even as loss in muscle mass plateaus[12,42,43]. Furthermore, individuals who lose the greatest amount of bone during bedrest do not coincide with those who experience the greatest amount of loss in muscle mass[43]. Also consistent with our results, there is no influence of the levels of activity (i.e., mechanical forces) on the recovery of bone mass during reambulation in mice[44]. Together, these studies suggest that the hypothesis of bone mass calibrated to altered levels of muscle cross-sectional area is not generally applicable. Our data do not disprove the general concept of a functional muscle-bone unit. They do, however, provide evidence for a lack of functional and/or genetic co-regulation of bone’s and muscle’s mechanosensitivity during unloading and reambulation in this genetically diverse mouse population. By extension, they also provide evidence that the relatively few, large-magnitude muscle contractions arising during daily weightbearing activities[45] are unlikely to dominate skeletal adaptation. Further, in light of the distinct genetic mechano-regulation of the two tissues, it could be speculated that the development of mechanical interventions for musculoskeletal ailments may have to be optimized independently for bone and muscle[46]. Regardless, our results emphasize that much work is required for a complete understanding of the mechanisms by which muscle and bone interact with each other while exposed to altered levels of weightbearing and that genetics is a variable that needs to be considered in these interactions.

Copyright notice ID: 5114340 PMID: 27609032 Abstract Little is known about interactions between muscle and bone during the removal and application of mechanical signals. Here, we applied 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. During reambulation, individual mice regained bone and muscle at different rates. Across mice, changes in muscle and trabecular/cortical bone were not correlated to each other during unloading or reambulation. For unloading, we found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for muscle area and five QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive muscle and cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between muscle and trabecular QTLs). The low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un)loading may need to be reassessed. Keywords: Muscle, Bone, Disuse, Genetics, MouseIntroduction The concept of a muscle-bone unit tuned to the magnitude of contractile forces has intuitive appeal as reflected by Darcy Thompson in 1917[1]: “Muscle and bone … are inseparably associated and connected; they are moulded one with another; they come into being together, and act and react together.” Indeed, strong correlations between muscle mass and bone mass have been found in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies, particularly over the course of growth and development[2], leading many to believe that mechanically adaptive changes in bone are initiated primarily by changes in muscle activity. Both cortical and trabecular bone have been included in muscle-bone correlations but it is unclear which type of bone is more highly associated with muscle strength[3-5]. Inherently, correlations used in these studies cannot infer causality and, alternatively, may reflect an indirect association via a shared underlying molecular signal[6]. Exercise induces a highly site-specific mechanical environment in the skeleton[7], yet high correlations between muscle strength and bone mineral density (BMD) span distant sites in the skeleton[8]. Thus, an association between muscle and bone may be more global than peak muscle forces locally altering bone (re)modeling at the specific anatomical site at which they act. Furthermore, if muscle was a causal factor during bone development, then increased muscle mass and muscle strength should precede the majority of bone mineral accrual. While such a sequential relationship has been observed using two-dimensional DXA[9], three-dimensional CT data show that bone mineral accrual may cease before peak muscle strength is reached[10]. At the other end of the spectrum, age-related sarcopenia reduces muscle loading of bone and, therefore, should induce bone loss. Contrary to the proposed functional muscle-bone relationship, substantial bone loss can precede equivalently detectable losses in muscle by nearly a decade[11]. These examples demonstrate inconsistencies in the paradigm of a muscle-bone unit that is regulated by the force exerted in skeletal muscle. The drastic changes in the mechanical environment associated with unloading and reambulation of the musculoskeleton during spaceflight, bedrest, or injury/disease provide a model system to further test muscle-bone interactions. Reflecting the high sensitivity of the musculoskeleton to mechanical signals, unloading causes both sarcopenia and osteopenia in humans and animal models[12,13] while reambulation recovers, at least in part, these losses[14-16]. Further, differences in genetic make-up between individuals, humans or mice[17,18], have been shown to greatly influence the magnitude of the skeletal response to unloading and reambulation, providing an opportunity to relate intra-individual differences in musculoskeletal adaptation across a wide phenotypic range. Muscle-bone relations can be tested at different levels – from molecules to organs. While molecular interactions have recently received considerable attention[19,20], much less is known about the genes that determine differences in musculoskeletal sensitivity to mechanical signals based on an individual’s genetic make-up. For trabecular bone, we have identified specific regions on chromosomes that harbor regulatory genes (quantitative trait loci or QTL) explaining the variability in bone’s response to unloading and reambulation across a genetically heterogeneous mouse population[18]. QTLs that regulate the susceptibility of cortical bone and muscle to unloading and subsequent reambulation are yet to be identified. Comparing regulatory genetic regions for the mechano-response between muscle and bone would afford insight into the muscle-bone unit at the genetic level. In an effort to test muscle-bone interactions at the tissue and genetic level, we used more than 350 adult mice from a genetically heterogeneous mouse population that display a large range of trabecular responses to unloading and reambulation[15,18,21]. Changes in muscle and cortical bone morphology during 3wk of unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation were quantified and associated with each other to test the hypothesis that those individuals who show the greatest muscular changes will coincide with those who show the greatest changes in bone. At the genetic level, the hypothesis that unloading/reambulation QTLs are similar between muscle and bone was considered.Methods Experimental design The study design has been described previously and data for trabecular bone have been reported[15,18,21]. Briefly, to produce a genetically heterogeneous mouse population with large individual differences in mechanosensitivity, the parental inbred mouse strains of female BALB/cByJ[22] and male C3H/HeJ[23] were double-crossed to produce the F2 offspring. At 4mo of age, female F2 mice were exposed to 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation. The unloading period was completed by 464 mice. A total of 352 mice completed both unloading and reambulation protocols. The length of the reambulation period was the same as the unloading period to capture the initial, mechanically induced response to the re-introduction of weightbearing and to minimize the influence of age-related changes in musculo-skeletal phenotypes. Muscle and bone data were also obtained from 25 normally ambulating F2 mice (n=25) that served as age-matched controlsChanges in muscle and cortical bone assessed by in vivo µCT The femoral diaphysis of both legs was scanned by in vivo micro-computed tomography (µCT) at baseline, after the unloading period, and after the reambulation period scans (VivaCT 40, Scanco Medical, SUI). An isotropic voxel size of 17.5µm with an integration time of 380ms, 1000 projections, 55kV and 109µA were used. There is no evidence that radiation at the prescribed levels influenced the tissue level response[18]. The analyzed region for mid-diaphyseal cortical bone was determined as a 2.1mm long region in axial direction centered at 50% of femoral length. Mid-diaphyseal cortical bone morphology was evaluated for cortical area (Ct.Ar), marrow area (Ma.Ar), and tissue mineral density (TMD) with sigma, support, and threshold values of 0.6, 1, and 220. The combined cross-sectional area of muscle groups (Mu.Ar) surrounding a 700µm long region centered at 50% of femoral length was determined using sigma, support and threshold values of 0.9, 1, and 71 (Figure 1). Total cortical area was subtracted from the total muscle area. For each mouse, any given muscle and bone µCT index was determined for the left and right leg and averaged into a single value. The first 81 mice were not included in the muscle unloading analysis because we used a µCT ROI for these mice that did not capture the entire muscle group, resulting in n=384 for changes in Mu.Ar during unloading (vs n=464 for cortical variables). Sample size for reambulation was identical for all variables. Figure 1. Open in a new tab A) Scout-view of the femur taken with the in vivo μCT scanner. Upon confirming that the femur was aligned, the scan region was centered at the femoral middiaphysis. B) Single μCT slice within the region in which muscle and cortical bone properties were determined. The white solid contour line surrounds the ROI of muscle tissue analyzed in a single leg. Total cortical bone area was excluded from the muscle area. For each mouse, the left and right leg were analyzed and averaged.Genotyping and QTL mapping Genotyping and QTL mapping for this set of mice has been described previously[18,21]. Briefly, DNA was prepared from tail tips and submitted to KBiosciences (U.K.) for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. SNPs were spaced at approximately 1MB intervals across the genome with 89 SNPs known to be polymorphic between the BALB/cByJ and C3H/HeJ inbred strains. Phenotypes pertaining to longitudinal changes during unloading, and reambulation were included in the QTL analysis performed via the statistical software R/QTL[24]. For genome-wide one-dimensional scans, pseudo-markers were generated at 2cM spacing for each chromosome and scans were performed using 256 imputations[25]. The thresholds for QTL detection were computed from one thousand permutations[26]. Four standard thresholds[27], 1%, 5%, 10%, and 63%, were used to identify a range of QTLs from strong (1% threshold) to suggestive (63% threshold). For genome-wide two-dimensional scans, pairwise scans were performed at 2cM spacing and LOD scores were calculated. QTL and possible QTL*QTL interactions identified from a single and pair wise QTL scan were fit into multiple regression models, facilitating the estimation of the variations of the phenotype in the models. P-values for terms in the multiple regression model were determined. Terms were dropped sequentially until all of the terms in the model were significant at the 1% level for main QTL effects and at 0.1% for interaction effects.Statistical phenotype analysis Data were presented as means and standard deviations. To avoid outliers, minimal and maximal changes in any given phenotype during unloading and reambulation were reported as the 5th (min) and 95th percentile (max) of the experimental population. Paired t-tests compared individual phenotypes between two different time points. Unpaired t-tests compared temporal changes (0-3wk or 3-6wk) in all muscle and bone outcome variables between experimental and age-matched control mice. When Levene’s test of Equality of Variances indicated that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was not met, the t-test was corrected for accordingly. Changes in individual muscle and bone variables were associated with each other within and between the two experimental phases. Changes in body mass were also associated with µCT variables during unloading and reambulation. Coefficients of determination and their corresponding p-values were reported. For all tests, statistical significance was set at p=0.05. IBM SPSS Statistics (version 22) was used.Results As expected from the F2 mouse population bred specifically for a large range in musculoskeletal mechanosensitivity, the response of both tissues to the two experimental regimes varied greatly across individuals. Body mass changes in these mice during unloading and reambulation[18] were not correlated with changes in any of the phenotype outcome variables (all R2<0.05). Unloading - Muscle During 3wk of unloading, muscle area (Mu.Ar) declined (p<0.001) on average by 9% (min: -26%, max: 9%) while in normally ambulating age-matched controls, Mu.Ar did not change significantly (mean: 2% min: -14%, max: 19%) over the same period (Table 1, Figure 2). The relative (net) mean difference of 11% (p<0.001) between the two groups was significant (i.e., mean loss in experimental mice during unloading was different from the non-significant mean gain in normal control mice). One QTL was identified on chromosome 5 for the loss in muscle cross-sectional area during unloading, explaining 5% (p<0.001) of the variability between mice (Figure 3). Table 1.

Peaks crossing the black, red, green, and blue lines denote QTLs at significance thresholds of 63%, 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.Reambulation - Muscle During reambulation, experimental mice averaged a 9% increase (p<0.001) in muscle area (min: -8% max: 31%), a change that was different (p<0.001) from the lack of growth in muscle area in age-matched controls (mean: 0%, min: -7%, max: 18%; Table 1, Figure 2). In experimental mice, individuals that experienced the greatest losses in muscle area during unloading were moderately correlated with those that experienced the greatest gain during reambulation (R2=0.32, p<0.0001; Figure 4). Two suggestive QTLs for the gain of muscle area upon reambulation were identified on chromosomal loci that differed from QTL identified for unloading (Figure 3). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Changes in muscle area during hindlimb unloading (HLU, horizontal axis) associated with changes in muscle area experienced during reambulation (RA, vertical axis).Unloading - Bone Unloading of the hindlimb reduced (p=0.04) cortical bone in the femoral diaphysis on average by 0.5% (min: -6%, max: 12%) while age matched controls gained 3% (p<0.001) over the same time period (min: 1%, max: 5%; Table 1, Figure 2). Changes in the two groups were different from each other (p<0.001) with a net difference of 4%. Bone marrow area increased (p<0.001) on average by 6% (min: -12% max: 16%) during unloading, a response that was significantly different (p<0.001) from age matched controls in which Ma.Ar did not change significantly (min: -2%, max: 5%; Table 1, Figure 2). Tissue mineral density increased (p=0.03) on average by 0.3% (min: -3%, max: 2%) during unloading, a smaller (p<0.001) increase than in age matched controls which gained 1% (p<0.001) over the same time period (min: 0%, max: 2%; Table 1, Figure 2). For changes in cortical bone area, three QTLs on chromosomes 9, 18, and 19 were determined for unloading (Figure 3), together accounting for 10% (p<0.001) of the variability in HLU induced change in Ct.Ar. QTLs responsible for the magnitude of change in bone marrow area during unloading were revealed on chromosomes 2 and 9, accounting for 10% (p<0.001) of the observed variability in this variable. No QTLs were found for changes in tissue mineral density during unloading.Reambulation - Bone During reambulation, increases in cortical area seen in experimental mice (mean: 4%, min: -1%, max: 9%, p<0.001) matched those of age matched controls (mean: 4%, min: 2%, max: 6%, p<0.001; Table 1, Figure 2). During the reambulation period, marrow area decreased to a greater (p=0.04) degree in experimental mice (mean: -2%, min: -11%, max: 8%, p<0.001) than in controls (mean: -1%, min: -3%, max: 4%, p=0.05). The increase (p<0001) in tissue mineral density was 1% both in experimentals (min: -1%, max: 3%) and controls (min: 0%, max: 3%) during this time period without a significant between-group difference. Only weak correlations were found between unloading and reambulation for changes in any given variable; R2 values for CT.Ar, Ma.Ar, and TMD amounted to 8%, 16%, and 7%, respectively (all p<0.0001). For reambulation and similar to muscle, no significant QTLs were identified for any of the three bone variables. For Ct.Ar, we found two suggestive QTLs (Chr 5 and 17) and for Ma.Ar, one suggested QTL was found (Chr 8) for reambulation (Figure 3).Associations between muscle and bone Both during unloading and reambulation, those mice displaying the greatest changes in muscle area did not coincide with those that showed the greatest changes in cortical bone; associations between changes in muscle area and cortical area resulted in R2-values of less than 10% (Figure 5). Coefficients of determination for changes in muscle area vs either marrow area or TMD were similarly low (data not shown). Extending the correlations between muscle and cortical bone to changes in trabecular bone previously reported from the metaphysis of the distal femur[18] produced similar results; R2-values for changes in muscle area versus changes in trabecular bone volume fraction yielded 11% for the unloading phase and less than 1% for the reambulation phase (Figure 5). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Associations between changes in muscle area vs cortical area (a. & c.) and changes in muscle area vs marrow area (b. & d.) for unloading (a. & b.) and reambulation (c. & d.).For unloading, the QTL for changes in muscle area on chromosome 5 did not overlap with those identified for cortical indices but shared common regions with previously determined trabecular QTLs from the same bones[18] for changes in three out of six trabecular indices; normalized bone surface, trabecular thickness, and trabecular tissue mineral density. For reambulation, the two suggestive QTLs for changes in muscle area on chromosomes 2 and 19 did not overlap with (suggestive) QTLs identified for cortical indices but with trabecular QTLs for changes in one out of six trabecular indices (trabecular number).Discussion We tested for co-regulation between changes in muscle and bone during removal and reapplication of weightbearing activities with the rationale that if muscle size controls bone size, we should observe robust correlations in the response of the two tissues. In contrast to this hypothesis, the magnitude of the response of the two tissues to unloading and reambulation was not correlated across a genetically heterogeneous mouse population. This lack of coordination between muscle and bone at the tissue level was somewhat similar at the genetic level. The strong QTL for changes in muscle area during unloading on chromosome 5 did not overlap with any QTLs for changes in cortical bone properties but shared a common region for some trabecular properties. While these data emphasize the strong influence of genetic variations on the response of both skeletal muscle and bone, the low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response, are inconsistent with the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-regulates its size during mechanical challenges. Several limitations should be considered when interpreting results from this study. First, we did not measure changes in muscle strength but muscle cross-sectional area as a surrogate measure of strength is well accepted in clinical and animal studies[28-32]. Second, we chose the composite cross-sectional muscle area of several individual muscles as we assumed that the forces exerted by these muscles are primarily responsible for inducing bone strains in the diaphysis (and metaphysis) of the mouse femur and because the µCT images did not allow for separation into distinct muscle groups. Third, we observed musculoskeletal changes in unloading and reambulation over a 3wk period each, a duration that significantly altered musculo-skeletal variables at the mouse femur during both unloading and reambulation but it is conceivable that time periods of different length would influence our results and conclusions. Using the initial adaptive changes in both tissues upon application of a new mechanical environment ostensibly provided the largest signals for the correlations and should have also minimized the limitation that changes in muscle and bone were quantified simultaneously, rather than sequentially with muscle measurements preceding bone measurements. Lastly, QTL studies have many strengths including the absence of assumptions regarding genes and molecular pathways giving rise to the trait of interest. Conversely, the identification of causative genes from the identified QTLs typically requires substantial effort[33] as QTLs can contain several hundred candidate genes[18] and we are currently pursuing a combined bioinformatic/transgenic mouse approach towards this critical goal[34]. There was a relatively small number of mice that added muscle and/or bone tissue during unloading. While we don’t know the reason for this pattern, it is conceivable that specific combinations of polymorphisms caused the tissue response of these mice go into the opposite direction from what we would have expected. This is plausible because by breeding a F2 population, it is likely that some mice will have a phenotype well beyond the expected boundaries set by the two progenitor inbred strains[35]. Because of the small number of mice displaying the opposite response pattern, no underlying QTLs could be determined. Inherently, it is also possible that noise in the data measurements contributed to this phenomenon. If it was true that combinations of polymorphisms cannot only prevent the catabolic response associated with unloading but can even produce a mild anabolic response, the identification of these polymorphisms may give rise to novel countermeasures. Muscle-bone interactions have recently received considerable attention[6,19,36]. Most of the interest has focused on molecular pathways by which muscle and bone can communicate with each other, rather than on how bone perceives forces produced by muscle. For instance, novel myokines have been identified that may either promote catabolism or anabolism in bone[20,37]. We did not measure (changes in) biochemical factors here but the low correlations between muscle and bone at the genetic and tissue level may indicate that molecular cross-tissue communication is not necessarily driven by changes in muscle size. Excellent relations between muscle and bone quantity have been reported in a number of species including mice and humans[38]. Many of these studies were cross-sectional in nature, precluding mechanistic inferences. Some longitudinal studies in mice have proposed functional relationships between changes in bone and muscle during (un)loading[39-41] but they were limited to temporal relations in a single inbred strain of mice. That our longitudinal study, taking advantage of a large sample of mice with greatly different mechano-responsivities, was not able to provide evidence for a mechanism by which changes in muscle size modulate changes in bone size should not be entirely surprising. Astronauts suffer from sarcopenia and ostepenia in space but the temporal patterns of muscle and bone loss are not suggestive of a causal relation; similar to paraplegia and bedrest, bone loss continues even as loss in muscle mass plateaus[12,42,43]. Furthermore, individuals who lose the greatest amount of bone during bedrest do not coincide with those who experience the greatest amount of loss in muscle mass[43]. Also consistent with our results, there is no influence of the levels of activity (i.e., mechanical forces) on the recovery of bone mass during reambulation in mice[44]. Together, these studies suggest that the hypothesis of bone mass calibrated to altered levels of muscle cross-sectional area is not generally applicable. Our data do not disprove the general concept of a functional muscle-bone unit. They do, however, provide evidence for a lack of functional and/or genetic co-regulation of bone’s and muscle’s mechanosensitivity during unloading and reambulation in this genetically diverse mouse population. By extension, they also provide evidence that the relatively few, large-magnitude muscle contractions arising during daily weightbearing activities[45] are unlikely to dominate skeletal adaptation. Further, in light of the distinct genetic mechano-regulation of the two tissues, it could be speculated that the development of mechanical interventions for musculoskeletal ailments may have to be optimized independently for bone and muscle[46]. Regardless, our results emphasize that much work is required for a complete understanding of the mechanisms by which muscle and bone interact with each other while exposed to altered levels of weightbearing and that genetics is a variable that needs to be considered in these interactions.

    "abstract": "Abstract Osteocyte apoptosis is essential to activate bone remodeling in response to fatigue microdamage and estrogen withdrawal, such that apoptosis inhibition in vivo prevents the onset of osteoclastic resorption. Osteocyte apoptosis has also been spatially linked to bone resorption owing to disuse, but whether apoptosis plays a similar controlling role is unclear. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor, QVD (quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methylketone). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify apoptotic and RANKL-producing osteocytes in femoral diaphysis and distal trabecular bone, and μCT was used to determine the extent of trabecular bone loss owing to HLU. In both cortical and trabecular bone, 5 days of HLU increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly (3- and 4-fold, respectively, p < 0.05 versus Ctrl). At day 14, the apoptotic osteocyte number in femoral cortices declined to near control levels but remained elevated in trabeculae (3-fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05). The number of osteocytes producing RANKL in both bone compartments was also significantly increased at day 5 of HLU (>1.5-fold versus Ctrl, p <0.05) and further increased by day 14. Increases in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL production preceded increases in bone resorption at both endocortical and trabecular surfaces. QVD completely inhibited not only the HLU-triggered increases in osteocyte apoptosis but also RANKL production and activation of bone resorption at both sites. Finally, μCT studies revealed that apoptosis inhibition completely prevented the trabecular bone loss caused by HLU. Together these data indicate that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering osteocyte RANKL production and the activation of new resorption leading to bone loss in disuse.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Bone remodeling, the sequential resorption of a bone packet by osteoclasts followed by deposition of new tissue at the same site by osteoblasts,(1–3) can be triggered by a variety of stimuli including microdamage,(4–8) changes in endocrine status (eg, ovarian hormone depletion),(9–12) and mechanical unloading or disuse.(13–15) In each instance, the activation of bone remodeling has been spatially and temporally associated with osteocyte apoptosis,(6,16–18) which precedes the recruitment of osteoclasts that resorb the region of bone containing the apoptotic osteocytes.(6,17–20) Moreover, this osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering bone resorption in response to microdamage and estrogen loss. Pharmacological inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis after bone fatigue or estrogen loss completely prevented both the activation of bone resorption and the bone loss that occur in response to these challenges.(19,20) Recent studies at microdamage sites in bone reveal that the dying osteocytes trigger viable, neighbor osteocytes to increase expression of the pro-osteoclastogenic cytokine receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), thus activating focal resorption.(21,22) Whether activation of resorption in other remodeling states, such as disuse or estrogen loss, operates through the same combination of osteocyte-based mechanisms (ie, apoptosis triggering resorption via activation of RANKL signaling from intact osteocytes) is unclear. Mechanical loading is of paramount importance to the maintenance of adult bone mass and architecture and to bone health in general. Prolonged unloading from space flight, extended bed rest, or paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury results in extensive and often irreversible bone loss. Disuse stimulates aggressive and extensive bone resorption in both cortical and cancellous bone in humans(23–26) and in animal models including primates(27,28) and dogs,(29–31) as well as mice(17,32,33) and rats(34,35) subjected to hindlimb unloading. Yet whether osteocyte apoptosis plays a causal role in activating bone resorption in disuse, as it does in microdamage and ovariectomy, is not fully resolved. Previously, Aguirre and colleagues(17) had shown that osteocyte apoptosis occurs in vertebral bone of tail-suspended, hindlimb-unloaded mice, indicating adverse effects on osteocyte integrity in this model. A recent study by Plotkin and colleagues(18) further concluded that dying osteocytes in lumbar vertebrae of hindlimb-unloaded mice do not significantly influence bone resorption. Here we report that, in contrast, both resorption activation and bone loss in long bones of mice subjected to hindlimb unloading are fully dependent on osteocyte apoptosis.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods To test the hypothesis that osteocyte apoptosis controls the activation of bone resorption after disuse, we measured osteocyte apoptosis, increases in RANKL-producing osteocytes, and resorption activation in femoral cortical and trabecular bone of control and hindlimb-unloaded mice in the presence or absence of treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor to suppress apoptosis. Hindlimb unloading as a model for disuse C57BL/6J mice (male, age 4 months, n = 6 per group, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were subjected to hindlimb unloading by tail suspension (HLU).(36,37) The tail suspension model adjusted for mice was used, at a 30° tilt on a swiveling harness as detailed by Judex and colleagues.(32,38) Animals were individually housed in standard cages at 25°C with unlimited rodent chow and water. Bones were examined after either 5 or 14 days of HLU. Day 5 captures the time at which increases in osteocyte apoptosis occur in both microdamage and ovariectomy,(6,19–21) whereas day 14 samples the subsequent increases in osteoclastic activity.(5,17,20) Age-matched non-HLU controls (cage controls) were allowed normal cage activity. All animal procedures were carried out under IACUC approved protocols from CCNY and Stony Brook University. In vivo apoptosis inhibition To assess whether osteocyte apoptosis is necessary for HLU-induced bone resorption, control and animals subjected to 14 days of HLU were treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methyl-ketone (QVD-OMePhe or QVD, SM Biochemicals, Livermore, CA, USA; IP injection: 20 mg/kg weight in DMSO vehicle) or vehicle alone. QVD has been used in numerous previous studies to prevent osteocyte apoptosis in vivo after fatigue microdamage and estrogen loss.(19,20,22) Animals were injected every other day throughout the experiment beginning on the day HLU was initiated. At the end of experiments, animals were euthanized by CO2, hindlimbs harvested, and bones fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Previous studies indicate no direct effect of QVD on osteoclast formation by total marrow cultures in vitro or on existing resorption surfaces in vivo.(19,39,40) In the current experiments, we further test whether QVD affects RANKL-induced osteoclast formation by the nonadherent mononuclear cell-enriched fraction of mouse bone marrow cells in vitro. In addition, we examined whether QVD directly alters osteocyte expression of RANKL, independent of its anti-apoptotic effects. QVD effects on osteoclastogenesis Osteoclasts were generated from marrow-derived mononuclear cells induced with RANKL and M-CSF, as in our previous studies.(41) Femurs of 8-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (n = 4) were harvested, then bone marrow cells were flushed using a 26-gauge needle, collected in αMEM, and drawn through an 18-gauge needle to achieve single-cell suspensions. Subsequently, cells were washed in αMEM and plated in αMEM+10% FBS overnight. On the next day, nonadherent mononuclear cells were cultured in osteoclast differentiation media (αMEM, 10% FBS, 60 ng/mL RANKL, and 40 ng/mL M-CSF) with 0, 5, or 25 mM QVD or vehicle (DMSO) for 7 days with medium changes every 2 days. The high concentration of QVD examined (25 mM) approximates the instantaneous peak level of QVD that mice received in vivo at the time of injection. At the end of the study period, primary osteoclast cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 10% glutaraldehyde solution for 15 minutes at 37°C. After two washes with PBS, cells were stained for TRAP activity for 10 to 15 minutes at 37°C (0.05 M sodium acetate, 0.025 M sodium tartrate, 0.125 mg/mL Fast Red Violet LB Salt, and 0.125 mg/mL Naphthol AS-MX phosphate) washed with water. Multinucleated, stained cells were counted using brightfield microscopy. QVD effects on osteocyte RANKL expression MLO-Y4 cells (gift from Dr L Bonewald), which normally express significant levels of RANKL,(42,43) were cultured in αMEM medium supplemented with 5% calf serum (CS), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin to confluence, then shifted to serum-free medium with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight. Cultures were treated with QVD at either 5 μM or 25 μM, or vehicle (DMSO) for 24 hours. RNA was isolated and expression of RANKL and GAPDH were assessed by RT-PCR, using procedures and primer sequences specific to mice, as previously described.(21,22) The respective forward and reverse primers used were ACGCAGATTTCAGGACTCG and GGGCCACATCCAACCATGAG for RANKL, and CGTGCCGCCTGGA-GAAACC and TGGAAGAGTGGGAGTTGCTGTTG for GAPDH. Bone architecture assessment via micro computed tomography (μCT) Trabecular bone architecture was assessed from μCT. Right femora were scanned with a high-resolution SkyScan 1172 μCT system (hardware version A, software version 1.5; Bruker microCT, Kontich, Belgium) and a Hamamatsu 10 Mp camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) following the guidelines recommended in Bouxsein and colleagues.(44) Images were acquired at 10-W power energy (100 KV and 100 mA), using a 0.5-mm aluminum filter and scanned at 6.7-μm pixel resolution. Five exposures per projection were used to produce high-contrast, low-noise images using a low-threshold value of 70 and all reconstruction parameters were applied identically to each scan. μCT studies were performed only on the distal femora to image trabecular bone, where the greatest bone loss occurs in the HLU mouse model. Trabecular bone was analyzed in a region of interest starting 400 μm from the end of the growth plate and extending 2 mm distally. Trabecular measurements included bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb. N, 1/mm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL expression Formalin-fixed left femora were decalcified with formic acid, dehydrated in 2-ethoxyethanol, and then embedded in ethyl methacrylate resin that allows for reliable immunostaining.(22) Transverse sections (5 μm thick) were cut from the mid-diaphyses for cortical bone studies, and longitudinal frontal sections were cut from the distal femora for analysis of trabecular bone. Right femora were embedded without decalcification in PMMA and used for histomorphometric analyses of cortical bone and trabecular bone, respectively. Sections were deplasticized in toluene and rehydrated with 2-ethoxyethanol and dH2O. Sections were incubated in a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes at room temperature to quench intrinsic tissue peroxidases, then incubated in a methanol-sodium hydroxide–based solution for 30 minutes at room temperature (DeCal Retrieval Solution, Biogenex, San Ramon, CA, USA) for antigen retrieval. To prevent nonspecific tissue binding of antibodies, sections were incubated in Serum-Free Protein Block (Dako Agilent Technologies, Carpinteria, CA, USA; #X0909) solution for 10 minutes in room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4°C with either primary rabbit antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 to detect apoptotic osteocytes (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; #9661; 1:200 with Dako Antibody Diluent S3022) or RANKL (AbCam, Cambridge, MA, USA; ab9957; also at 1:200 dilution). Detection of primary antibodies was performed by incubation of sections in anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA; MP-7401) for 30 minutes followed by visualization using a DAB-horseradish peroxidase substrate detection system (Vector ImmPact DAB, SK-4105). Chondrocytes within the tibial growth plates of 10-week-old adolescent mice were used as positive controls to detect expression of cleaved caspase 3 and RANKL, and non-immune serum was used as the negative staining controls. Histomorphometry Caspase-3 and RANKL positively stained osteocytes were counted and expressed as a percentage of total number of osteocytes in each region (%Casp3+Ot and %RANKL+Ot, respectively). Osteocyte measurements were made in the 5-day and 14-day tail-suspended animal and appropriate control bones. Data were collected at ×400 magnification. Cortical bone Casp3+Ot and RANKL+Ot and total osteocytes were counted in 0.025 to 0.035 mm2 sampling regions located at each principal anatomical quadrant of the femur (anterior, medial, posterior, lateral) as illustrated in Fig 1. In addition, data were collected for the radial distribution of each osteocyte category at each region from the endosteal to the periosteal surface. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab (A) Femoral mid-diaphyseal section showing the anatomical sampling regions examined. (B) Photomicrographs of mid-diaphyseal cortical bone sections from mice subjected to 5 days of unloading (5d HLU) stained by immunohistochemistry for activated caspase 3 (Casp3, top left), its negative control (Neg Ctrl, bottom left); RANKL (top right), and its negative control (bottom right). Arrows indicate positively stained osteocytes (+Ot); scale bars = 40 μm.Trabecular bone %Casp3+Ot and %RANKL+Ot osteocytes were counted in the metaphyseal area corresponding to the region examined with μCT. Because Plotkin and colleagues(18) reported increases in trabecular marrow–associated “osteoblast” RANKL staining with long-duration HLU, we also measured RANKL+ osteoblasts and marrow cells adjacent to bone surfaces in the distal femur. Cortical bone resorption was assessed by measuring the percentage of eroded perimeter (Ec.Rs, %) at the endocortical surface of femoral mid-diaphyses, where cortical resorption occurs almost exclusively in this model.(32,42,45) Measurements were performed on undecalcified cross sections (80 μm thick, two sections per bone) from the contralateral femurs (ie, opposite from those used for IHC studies) because obtaining dimensionally reliable surface measurements from decalcified diaphyseal cross sections is problematic,(20) whereas thick sections used for surface measurements are unsuitable for counting osteoclast markers (Cathepsin K or TRAP). Trabecular bone active resorption was determined by measuring the percentage of bone perimeter (%CatK+Pm) with cells immunostained for the osteoclast marker Cathepsin K;(46) IHC staining (AbCam ab19027, rabbit polyclonal antibody IgG, 1:200) followed the procedure described above. All osteocyte and bone histomorphometry data were collected using Osteomeasure (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA, USA), and data were collected by a single observer. Statistical analysis Differences in cortical osteocyte apoptosis as functions of anatomical region and time of HLU were examined by two-way ANOVA and post hoc differences tested using Tukey’s HSD. Differences in overall osteocyte apoptosis, osteocyte RANKL, and resorption with respect to single factors (time, QVD treatment) were assessed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc differences tested using Tukey’s HSD. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess differences among in vitro cell responses to QVD dose levels. Data are shown as mean ± SD.",
    "results": "Results Cortical bone osteocyte apoptosis, osteocyte RANKL expression, and bone resorption with HLU Hindlimb unloading caused a dramatic increase in the overall number of apoptotic osteocytes in femoral mid-diaphysis after 5 days of HLU, with %Casp3+Ot increased approximately 3-fold versus cage controls (p <0.05). Osteocyte apoptosis increased at all anatomical locations examined (Fig. 2), with the largest increase in the posterior cortex (approximately 5-fold versus cage controls, p <0.05) and approximately 2- to 3-fold increases versus cage controls in the anterior, medial, and lateral cortical regions as well (p >0.1). Significant differences in the radial distribution of osteocyte apoptosis were observed as well. Increases in overall %Casp3+Ot after 5 days of HLU were greatest near the endocortical surface (p <0.05; Fig. 2) but were similar to control levels moving toward the periosteum (p >0.4). Apoptotic osteocytes declined toward baseline levels by 14 days of HLU in all locations (Fig. 2). Pooled data for all anatomical locations were used to assess changes in osteocyte RANKL expression (%RANKL+Ot), endocortical resorption (%Ec.Rs.), as well as (%Casp3+Ot) over time of HLU (Fig. 3). After 14 days of HLU, osteocyte apoptosis declined toward baseline levels (Fig. 3, p >0.1). RANKL-expressing osteocytes increased markedly by 5 days of unloading (Fig. 3, p <0.05 versus cage Ctrl). However, in contrast to the decrease in apoptotic osteocytes found after 14 days of HLU, RANKL+ osteocytes remained significantly elevated after 14 days of HLU (p <0.05 versus cage Ctrl). Endocortical resorption was not increased at 5 days of HLU—the time of greatest osteocyte apoptosis—but was increased almost 5-fold over baseline after 14 days of HLU (Fig. 3, p <0.05). Fig. 2.

Baseline (day 0) is age-matched cage control value (*p <0.05 versus baseline [day 0] control). Trabecular bone osteocyte apoptosis, RANKL expression, and bone resorption after HLU Unloading caused a 4-fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic osteocytes in femoral trabecular bone after 5 days (p <0.05 versus Ctrl), and unlike cortical bone, trabecular apoptotic osteocytes remained highly elevated after 14 days of HLU (p <0.05 versus Ctrl). RANKL-expressing osteocytes increased after 5 days of HLU (p <0.05) and were further increased after 14 days of unloading (p <0.05 versus Ctrl). No increases in RANKL+ osteoblast or associated marrow cells were found with HLU. As in cortical bone, trabecular surface resorption was markedly increased only after 14 days of HLU (p <0.05 versus Ctrl), and more critically, only after the increases in osteocyte apoptosis and osteocyte RANKL expression had occurred. Data for trabecular bone osteocyte apoptosis, osteocyte RANKL, osteoblastic RANKL, and resorption surface are summarized in Fig. 4. Fig. 4.

Effects of the pan-caspase inhibitor QVD on osteoclastogenesis and osteocyte RANKL expression in vitro QVD had no effect on formation of TRAP+ multinucleated cells in vitro (Fig. 5, p >0.4). In addition, QVD had no effect on RANKL gene expression in MLO-Y4 osteocytes (Fig. 5, p >0.4). These data indicate that QVD effects in the current studies are mediated through its anti-apoptotic action and not through any direct off-target effects on osteoclastogenesis and RANKL signaling.

In vivo inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis Administration of QVD (ApInh) completely prevented the increases in osteocyte apoptosis and osteocyte RANKL expression in cortical bone after 5 days of HLU apoptotic osteocytes, and prevented increased endocortical resorption caused by 14 days of HLU (Fig. 6). Similarly in trabecular bone, treatment with the apoptosis inhibitor during HLU also prevented the increases in osteocyte apoptosis, osteocyte RANKL expression, and trabecular bone resorption (Fig. 7). Moreover, HLU-induced losses of trabecular bone volume and architecture were effectively prevented by treatment with the apoptosis inhibitor (Fig. 8). Fig. 6.

    "discussion": "Discussion The results of this study demonstrate that increases in resorption of both cortical and trabecular bone owing to hindlimb unloading in the femur are spatially and temporally associated with acutely increased levels of osteocyte apoptosis. These results are consistent with previous findings for the activation of bone resorption resulting from fatigue-induced microdamage and estrogen depletion in appendicular bone.(19,20,22) The current studies further show that HLU caused an increase in RANKL-expressing osteocytes and that these occurred in the same regions where osteocyte apoptosis was observed. We also found that when osteocyte apoptosis was prevented with a caspase inhibitor, the increases in the number of RANKL-positive osteocytes in the same regions of bone were also prevented. These observations are consistent with recent studies by Kennedy and colleagues,(22) who reported that pharmacological prevention of osteocyte apoptosis at microdamage sites also prevents triggering of RANKL expression by the viable neighboring osteocytes. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis prevented HLU-induced resorption increases in both cortical and cancellous bone. Indeed, cancellous bone loss in the femur after HLU was prevented by inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis. Increased osteocyte apoptosis in HLU preceded resorption, as it did in models of fatigue microdamage and estrogen depletion(5,19,20,45) and consistent with a role in triggering resorption. Yet although apoptotic cell numbers declined at 14 days in cortical bone, likely because of resorption of the tissue containing the apoptotic cells, the numbers of apoptotic cells remained high in trabecular bone. Because apoptotic cell degeneration is often rapid once effector caspases (like Caspase-3) are activated,(6,20) this finding suggests that new osteocytes undergo apoptosis throughout HLU, particularly in trabecular bone. The stimuli responsible for long-term propagation of apoptosis in HLU and the basis for the differences between cortical and trabecular bone have yet to be established. We also observed that the distribution of osteocyte apoptosis in the cortex in HLU was elevated in all anatomical regions of the femoral mid-diaphysis examined, a result that differs from the discrete, localized regions of osteocyte death found after estrogen withdrawal.(20) Why these distinct resorption-activating challenges result in such different patterns of osteocyte apoptosis remains obscure at this time. Nevertheless, some critical insights can be gleaned. A focal injury mechanism can readily explain increased osteocyte apoptosis at bone micro-damage sites, whereas the regional localization of osteocyte apoptosis after ovariectomy appears to reflect the combination of oxidative stress from estrogen loss superimposed on older osteocytes that are found in characteristic locations in mouse diaphyseal cortical bone.(20) In contrast, insufficient mechanical loading in disuse states like HLU leads to a more global impairment of fluid-solute transport to and from osteocytes in the lacunar-canalicular system (LCS) and consequently a generalized metabolic stress on all osteocytes in non-loaded bones.(47,48) It seems reasonable to posit that the more extensive circumferential distribution of apoptotic osteocytes throughout the femoral cortex, compared with the regionally localized osteocyte apoptosis found in estrogen loss and microdamage, reflects this global stress scenario. Osteocytes depend completely on pericellular fluid for solute transport, including oxygen, nutrition, signaling proteins, and waste removal. Solute movement in the LCS fluid is dependent on molecular size. Small solutes under 1 kDa, eg, steroid hormones, glucose, ATP, NO, CO2, and O2, move easily by diffusion in the fluid space; however, for larger molecules like cytokines, convective transport resulting from normal mechanical loading of bone is required.(47–51) Indeed, Gross and colleagues reported, using an ulnar-unloading model, that osteocyte HIF-1α expression, a cell stress marker, was acutely and uniformly elevated throughout the cortex, consistent with the idea of uniform stress on osteocytes from disuse.(52) Interestingly, Gross and colleagues also found that although increases of HIF-1α-expressing osteocytes were uniform around the cortex, osteocyte HIF-1α expression in disuse was greatest in intracortical regions closest to blood vessels and near the endocortical surface. In the current studies, we also found that the highest levels of osteocyte apoptosis in cortical bone with HLU were closest to the endocortical surface—the region of highest blood flow in the rodent cortex; changes in marrow cavity pressure and venous stasis in the marrow cavity occur with disuse.(53) That similar apoptotic levels do not occur for osteocytes nearer to the periosteal surface may indicate that their fluid transport system remains more effective in disuse, perhaps because of muscle contractions, which still operate during HLU.(54–56) Indeed, the presence of elevated osteocyte apoptosis in all anatomical regions suggests a uniform, distributed stress in bone resulting from disuse, whereas the greater number of apoptotic osteocytes near the endocortical surface in disuse may suggest that these osteocytes are more in need of growth factors and survival cytokines than those further deep in the bone matrix. Nakashima and colleagues(57) and Xiong and colleagues(58) demonstrated that RANKL from osteocytes is essential for normal bone resorption in growing mice, and its absence causes marked osteopetrosis. Kennedy and colleagues(21,22) showed that osteocyte apoptosis at microdamage sites in bone triggered increased RANKL expression in viable osteocytes neighboring the zone of apoptosis and that this RANKL upregulation in turn activated intracortical resorption. The current studies showing that osteocyte RANKL expression with disuse is also triggered by osteocyte apoptosis and that the increases in both osteocyte RANKL expression and HLU-induced bone resorption did not occur when osteocyte apoptosis was inhibited pharmacologically are fully consistent with those previously reported scenarios. Plotkin and colleagues(18) used a novel bisphosphonate to prevent osteocyte apoptosis in the lumbar vertebral bodies of HLU mice. They also found that preventing HLU-induced osteocyte death prevented the neighboring osteocytes from turning on RANKL production, consistent with the mechanisms reported by Kennedy and colleagues at bone microdamage sites(22) and with the results found in the current studies. However, in contrast to the current and previous investigations, Plotkin and colleagues did not find any attenuation of bone resorption in their studies. They observed increased RANKL production in marrow osteoblast lineage cells that were not affected by apoptosis inhibition and suggested that this RANKL source was the principal driver of resorption. In the current studies, we did not find RANKL staining increases in the osteoblastic cells of the cancellous compartment in distal femurs with HLU. There are several possible reasons for the discrepancy between the current results and those of Plotkin and collegues. First, different classes of drugs were used to inhibit osteocyte apoptosis; we used a well-established pan-caspase inhibitor,(19,22,39,40) which showed no effects on RANKL gene expression and osteoclastogenesis in our in vitro studies, whereas Plotkin and colleagues employed a novel bisphosphonate with anti-apoptotic properties. Further studies are needed to explore this possibility. More critical differences between these two studies are the biology and local mechanical loads that the bone study sites experienced. Plotkin and colleagues examined lumbar vertebrae, whereas in the current studies, we examined femurs. These two sites are elements of the axial and appendicular skeleton, respectively, with well-known differences in developmental, intrinsic remodeling rates and in the amounts of hematopoietic and fatty marrow they contain.(59,60) Moreover, there is a fundamental difference between the mechanical stimuli these two sites experience in the HLU model, and this may be key to explaining the very different results of these studies. Tail suspension in rodents was designed specifically to unload the hindlimbs. However, because mice and rats are suspended by their tails in HLU, the lumbar and caudal vertebrae and associated tissues experience dramatically elevated tensile and torsional forces(61) as the animal moves about the cage—forces that the rodent spine does not experience in normal mechanical loading. Indeed, Holguin and colleagues(62) found that HLU suspension causes loss of intervertebral disc volume, which is the opposite of the increases in disc volume found in astronauts during spaceflight and in subjects during bed-rest studies. In fact, these HLU changes are typical of rapid intervertebral disc degeneration,(62) and disc cells in degeneration produce a range of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17, that promote extracellular matrix degradation and also influence the adjacent vertebral bone.(63,64) The full ramifications of the altered loading of the caudal and lumbar spine in HLU remain to be elucidated. However, it is clear that the lumbar vertebrae do not see an unloaded environment like that experienced by the hindlimbs in HLU, and such biomechanical differences combined with the locally elevated levels of inflammatory regulators would certainly influence resorption responses in bone. In summary, the temporal and spatial coupling between osteocyte apoptosis and bone resorption after HLU strongly resemble that found in targeted remodeling of bone micro-damage and after estrogen loss in rodents.(19,20,22) In all cases, osteocyte apoptosis triggers a rise in the number of RANKL-positive osteocytes and subsequent increases in osteoclast recruitment, the effects of which are found in increased bone resorption. After 5 days of unloading, the numbers of apoptotic osteocytes were four times more than that of controls in both cortical and trabecular bone compartments. Similarly, increases in RANKL-positive osteocytes were also detected in these bone regions, and by day 14 of unloading, there were significant increases in bone resorption not observed after 5 days of HLU, and especially apparent in the bone volume fraction losses in the distal femur trabecular bone. Dramatically, inhibition of apoptosis completely prevented the increases in the numbers of apoptotic and RANKL-producing osteocytes and the bone loss associated with unloading, providing further support for the concept that osteocyte apoptosis is a common final pathway for activating and targeting bone resorption in response to diverse stimuli.(65)",

Copyright notice ID: 5488280 MSID: MS866074 PMID: 26852281 The publisher's version of this article is available at J Bone Miner Res Abstract Osteocyte apoptosis is essential to activate bone remodeling in response to fatigue microdamage and estrogen withdrawal, such that apoptosis inhibition in vivo prevents the onset of osteoclastic resorption. Osteocyte apoptosis has also been spatially linked to bone resorption owing to disuse, but whether apoptosis plays a similar controlling role is unclear. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor, QVD (quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methylketone). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify apoptotic and RANKL-producing osteocytes in femoral diaphysis and distal trabecular bone, and μCT was used to determine the extent of trabecular bone loss owing to HLU. In both cortical and trabecular bone, 5 days of HLU increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly (3- and 4-fold, respectively, p < 0.05 versus Ctrl). At day 14, the apoptotic osteocyte number in femoral cortices declined to near control levels but remained elevated in trabeculae (3-fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05). The number of osteocytes producing RANKL in both bone compartments was also significantly increased at day 5 of HLU (>1.5-fold versus Ctrl, p <0.05) and further increased by day 14. Increases in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL production preceded increases in bone resorption at both endocortical and trabecular surfaces. QVD completely inhibited not only the HLU-triggered increases in osteocyte apoptosis but also RANKL production and activation of bone resorption at both sites. Finally, μCT studies revealed that apoptosis inhibition completely prevented the trabecular bone loss caused by HLU. Together these data indicate that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering osteocyte RANKL production and the activation of new resorption leading to bone loss in disuse.Introduction Bone remodeling, the sequential resorption of a bone packet by osteoclasts followed by deposition of new tissue at the same site by osteoblasts,(1–3) can be triggered by a variety of stimuli including microdamage,(4–8) changes in endocrine status (eg, ovarian hormone depletion),(9–12) and mechanical unloading or disuse.(13–15) In each instance, the activation of bone remodeling has been spatially and temporally associated with osteocyte apoptosis,(6,16–18) which precedes the recruitment of osteoclasts that resorb the region of bone containing the apoptotic osteocytes.(6,17–20) Moreover, this osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering bone resorption in response to microdamage and estrogen loss. Pharmacological inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis after bone fatigue or estrogen loss completely prevented both the activation of bone resorption and the bone loss that occur in response to these challenges.(19,20) Recent studies at microdamage sites in bone reveal that the dying osteocytes trigger viable, neighbor osteocytes to increase expression of the pro-osteoclastogenic cytokine receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), thus activating focal resorption.(21,22) Whether activation of resorption in other remodeling states, such as disuse or estrogen loss, operates through the same combination of osteocyte-based mechanisms (ie, apoptosis triggering resorption via activation of RANKL signaling from intact osteocytes) is unclear. Mechanical loading is of paramount importance to the maintenance of adult bone mass and architecture and to bone health in general. Prolonged unloading from space flight, extended bed rest, or paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury results in extensive and often irreversible bone loss. Disuse stimulates aggressive and extensive bone resorption in both cortical and cancellous bone in humans(23–26) and in animal models including primates(27,28) and dogs,(29–31) as well as mice(17,32,33) and rats(34,35) subjected to hindlimb unloading. Yet whether osteocyte apoptosis plays a causal role in activating bone resorption in disuse, as it does in microdamage and ovariectomy, is not fully resolved. Previously, Aguirre and colleagues(17) had shown that osteocyte apoptosis occurs in vertebral bone of tail-suspended, hindlimb-unloaded mice, indicating adverse effects on osteocyte integrity in this model. A recent study by Plotkin and colleagues(18) further concluded that dying osteocytes in lumbar vertebrae of hindlimb-unloaded mice do not significantly influence bone resorption. Here we report that, in contrast, both resorption activation and bone loss in long bones of mice subjected to hindlimb unloading are fully dependent on osteocyte apoptosis.Materials and Methods To test the hypothesis that osteocyte apoptosis controls the activation of bone resorption after disuse, we measured osteocyte apoptosis, increases in RANKL-producing osteocytes, and resorption activation in femoral cortical and trabecular bone of control and hindlimb-unloaded mice in the presence or absence of treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor to suppress apoptosis. Hindlimb unloading as a model for disuse C57BL/6J mice (male, age 4 months, n = 6 per group, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were subjected to hindlimb unloading by tail suspension (HLU).(36,37) The tail suspension model adjusted for mice was used, at a 30° tilt on a swiveling harness as detailed by Judex and colleagues.(32,38) Animals were individually housed in standard cages at 25°C with unlimited rodent chow and water. Bones were examined after either 5 or 14 days of HLU. Day 5 captures the time at which increases in osteocyte apoptosis occur in both microdamage and ovariectomy,(6,19–21) whereas day 14 samples the subsequent increases in osteoclastic activity.(5,17,20) Age-matched non-HLU controls (cage controls) were allowed normal cage activity. All animal procedures were carried out under IACUC approved protocols from CCNY and Stony Brook University.In vivo apoptosis inhibition To assess whether osteocyte apoptosis is necessary for HLU-induced bone resorption, control and animals subjected to 14 days of HLU were treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methyl-ketone (QVD-OMePhe or QVD, SM Biochemicals, Livermore, CA, USA; IP injection: 20 mg/kg weight in DMSO vehicle) or vehicle alone. QVD has been used in numerous previous studies to prevent osteocyte apoptosis in vivo after fatigue microdamage and estrogen loss.(19,20,22) Animals were injected every other day throughout the experiment beginning on the day HLU was initiated. At the end of experiments, animals were euthanized by CO2, hindlimbs harvested, and bones fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Previous studies indicate no direct effect of QVD on osteoclast formation by total marrow cultures in vitro or on existing resorption surfaces in vivo.(19,39,40) In the current experiments, we further test whether QVD affects RANKL-induced osteoclast formation by the nonadherent mononuclear cell-enriched fraction of mouse bone marrow cells in vitro. In addition, we examined whether QVD directly alters osteocyte expression of RANKL, independent of its anti-apoptotic effects.QVD effects on osteoclastogenesis Osteoclasts were generated from marrow-derived mononuclear cells induced with RANKL and M-CSF, as in our previous studies.(41) Femurs of 8-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (n = 4) were harvested, then bone marrow cells were flushed using a 26-gauge needle, collected in αMEM, and drawn through an 18-gauge needle to achieve single-cell suspensions. Subsequently, cells were washed in αMEM and plated in αMEM+10% FBS overnight. On the next day, nonadherent mononuclear cells were cultured in osteoclast differentiation media (αMEM, 10% FBS, 60 ng/mL RANKL, and 40 ng/mL M-CSF) with 0, 5, or 25 mM QVD or vehicle (DMSO) for 7 days with medium changes every 2 days. The high concentration of QVD examined (25 mM) approximates the instantaneous peak level of QVD that mice received in vivo at the time of injection. At the end of the study period, primary osteoclast cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 10% glutaraldehyde solution for 15 minutes at 37°C. After two washes with PBS, cells were stained for TRAP activity for 10 to 15 minutes at 37°C (0.05 M sodium acetate, 0.025 M sodium tartrate, 0.125 mg/mL Fast Red Violet LB Salt, and 0.125 mg/mL Naphthol AS-MX phosphate) washed with water. Multinucleated, stained cells were counted using brightfield microscopy.QVD effects on osteocyte RANKL expression MLO-Y4 cells (gift from Dr L Bonewald), which normally express significant levels of RANKL,(42,43) were cultured in αMEM medium supplemented with 5% calf serum (CS), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin to confluence, then shifted to serum-free medium with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight. Cultures were treated with QVD at either 5 μM or 25 μM, or vehicle (DMSO) for 24 hours. RNA was isolated and expression of RANKL and GAPDH were assessed by RT-PCR, using procedures and primer sequences specific to mice, as previously described.(21,22) The respective forward and reverse primers used were ACGCAGATTTCAGGACTCG and GGGCCACATCCAACCATGAG for RANKL, and CGTGCCGCCTGGA-GAAACC and TGGAAGAGTGGGAGTTGCTGTTG for GAPDH.Bone architecture assessment via micro computed tomography (μCT) Trabecular bone architecture was assessed from μCT. Right femora were scanned with a high-resolution SkyScan 1172 μCT system (hardware version A, software version 1.5; Bruker microCT, Kontich, Belgium) and a Hamamatsu 10 Mp camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) following the guidelines recommended in Bouxsein and colleagues.(44) Images were acquired at 10-W power energy (100 KV and 100 mA), using a 0.5-mm aluminum filter and scanned at 6.7-μm pixel resolution. Five exposures per projection were used to produce high-contrast, low-noise images using a low-threshold value of 70 and all reconstruction parameters were applied identically to each scan. μCT studies were performed only on the distal femora to image trabecular bone, where the greatest bone loss occurs in the HLU mouse model. Trabecular bone was analyzed in a region of interest starting 400 μm from the end of the growth plate and extending 2 mm distally. Trabecular measurements included bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb. N, 1/mm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm).Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL expression Formalin-fixed left femora were decalcified with formic acid, dehydrated in 2-ethoxyethanol, and then embedded in ethyl methacrylate resin that allows for reliable immunostaining.(22) Transverse sections (5 μm thick) were cut from the mid-diaphyses for cortical bone studies, and longitudinal frontal sections were cut from the distal femora for analysis of trabecular bone. Right femora were embedded without decalcification in PMMA and used for histomorphometric analyses of cortical bone and trabecular bone, respectively. Sections were deplasticized in toluene and rehydrated with 2-ethoxyethanol and dH2O. Sections were incubated in a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes at room temperature to quench intrinsic tissue peroxidases, then incubated in a methanol-sodium hydroxide–based solution for 30 minutes at room temperature (DeCal Retrieval Solution, Biogenex, San Ramon, CA, USA) for antigen retrieval. To prevent nonspecific tissue binding of antibodies, sections were incubated in Serum-Free Protein Block (Dako Agilent Technologies, Carpinteria, CA, USA; #X0909) solution for 10 minutes in room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4°C with either primary rabbit antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 to detect apoptotic osteocytes (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; #9661; 1:200 with Dako Antibody Diluent S3022) or RANKL (AbCam, Cambridge, MA, USA; ab9957; also at 1:200 dilution). Detection of primary antibodies was performed by incubation of sections in anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA; MP-7401) for 30 minutes followed by visualization using a DAB-horseradish peroxidase substrate detection system (Vector ImmPact DAB, SK-4105). Chondrocytes within the tibial growth plates of 10-week-old adolescent mice were used as positive controls to detect expression of cleaved caspase 3 and RANKL, and non-immune serum was used as the negative staining controls.Histomorphometry Caspase-3 and RANKL positively stained osteocytes were counted and expressed as a percentage of total number of osteocytes in each region (%Casp3+Ot and %RANKL+Ot, respectively). Osteocyte measurements were made in the 5-day and 14-day tail-suspended animal and appropriate control bones. Data were collected at ×400 magnification. Cortical bone Casp3+Ot and RANKL+Ot and total osteocytes were counted in 0.025 to 0.035 mm2 sampling regions located at each principal anatomical quadrant of the femur (anterior, medial, posterior, lateral) as illustrated in Fig 1. In addition, data were collected for the radial distribution of each osteocyte category at each region from the endosteal to the periosteal surface. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab (A) Femoral mid-diaphyseal section showing the anatomical sampling regions examined. (B) Photomicrographs of mid-diaphyseal cortical bone sections from mice subjected to 5 days of unloading (5d HLU) stained by immunohistochemistry for activated caspase 3 (Casp3, top left), its negative control (Neg Ctrl, bottom left); RANKL (top right), and its negative control (bottom right). Arrows indicate positively stained osteocytes (+Ot); scale bars = 40 μm.Trabecular bone %Casp3+Ot and %RANKL+Ot osteocytes were counted in the metaphyseal area corresponding to the region examined with μCT. Because Plotkin and colleagues(18) reported increases in trabecular marrow–associated “osteoblast” RANKL staining with long-duration HLU, we also measured RANKL+ osteoblasts and marrow cells adjacent to bone surfaces in the distal femur. Cortical bone resorption was assessed by measuring the percentage of eroded perimeter (Ec.Rs, %) at the endocortical surface of femoral mid-diaphyses, where cortical resorption occurs almost exclusively in this model.(32,42,45) Measurements were performed on undecalcified cross sections (80 μm thick, two sections per bone) from the contralateral femurs (ie, opposite from those used for IHC studies) because obtaining dimensionally reliable surface measurements from decalcified diaphyseal cross sections is problematic,(20) whereas thick sections used for surface measurements are unsuitable for counting osteoclast markers (Cathepsin K or TRAP). Trabecular bone active resorption was determined by measuring the percentage of bone perimeter (%CatK+Pm) with cells immunostained for the osteoclast marker Cathepsin K;(46) IHC staining (AbCam ab19027, rabbit polyclonal antibody IgG, 1:200) followed the procedure described above. All osteocyte and bone histomorphometry data were collected using Osteomeasure (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA, USA), and data were collected by a single observer.Statistical analysis Differences in cortical osteocyte apoptosis as functions of anatomical region and time of HLU were examined by two-way ANOVA and post hoc differences tested using Tukey’s HSD. Differences in overall osteocyte apoptosis, osteocyte RANKL, and resorption with respect to single factors (time, QVD treatment) were assessed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc differences tested using Tukey’s HSD. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess differences among in vitro cell responses to QVD dose levels. Data are shown as mean ± SD.Results Cortical bone osteocyte apoptosis, osteocyte RANKL expression, and bone resorption with HLU Hindlimb unloading caused a dramatic increase in the overall number of apoptotic osteocytes in femoral mid-diaphysis after 5 days of HLU, with %Casp3+Ot increased approximately 3-fold versus cage controls (p <0.05). Osteocyte apoptosis increased at all anatomical locations examined (Fig. 2), with the largest increase in the posterior cortex (approximately 5-fold versus cage controls, p <0.05) and approximately 2- to 3-fold increases versus cage controls in the anterior, medial, and lateral cortical regions as well (p >0.1). Significant differences in the radial distribution of osteocyte apoptosis were observed as well. Increases in overall %Casp3+Ot after 5 days of HLU were greatest near the endocortical surface (p <0.05; Fig. 2) but were similar to control levels moving toward the periosteum (p >0.4). Apoptotic osteocytes declined toward baseline levels by 14 days of HLU in all locations (Fig. 2). Pooled data for all anatomical locations were used to assess changes in osteocyte RANKL expression (%RANKL+Ot), endocortical resorption (%Ec.Rs.), as well as (%Casp3+Ot) over time of HLU (Fig. 3). After 14 days of HLU, osteocyte apoptosis declined toward baseline levels (Fig. 3, p >0.1). RANKL-expressing osteocytes increased markedly by 5 days of unloading (Fig. 3, p <0.05 versus cage Ctrl). However, in contrast to the decrease in apoptotic osteocytes found after 14 days of HLU, RANKL+ osteocytes remained significantly elevated after 14 days of HLU (p <0.05 versus cage Ctrl). Endocortical resorption was not increased at 5 days of HLU—the time of greatest osteocyte apoptosis—but was increased almost 5-fold over baseline after 14 days of HLU (Fig. 3, p <0.05). Fig. 2.

Baseline (day 0) is age-matched cage control value (*p <0.05 versus baseline [day 0] control).Trabecular bone osteocyte apoptosis, RANKL expression, and bone resorption after HLU Unloading caused a 4-fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic osteocytes in femoral trabecular bone after 5 days (p <0.05 versus Ctrl), and unlike cortical bone, trabecular apoptotic osteocytes remained highly elevated after 14 days of HLU (p <0.05 versus Ctrl). RANKL-expressing osteocytes increased after 5 days of HLU (p <0.05) and were further increased after 14 days of unloading (p <0.05 versus Ctrl). No increases in RANKL+ osteoblast or associated marrow cells were found with HLU. As in cortical bone, trabecular surface resorption was markedly increased only after 14 days of HLU (p <0.05 versus Ctrl), and more critically, only after the increases in osteocyte apoptosis and osteocyte RANKL expression had occurred. Data for trabecular bone osteocyte apoptosis, osteocyte RANKL, osteoblastic RANKL, and resorption surface are summarized in Fig. 4. Fig. 4.

Baseline (day 0) is cage control value (*p <0.05 versus control).Effects of the pan-caspase inhibitor QVD on osteoclastogenesis and osteocyte RANKL expression in vitro QVD had no effect on formation of TRAP+ multinucleated cells in vitro (Fig. 5, p >0.4). In addition, QVD had no effect on RANKL gene expression in MLO-Y4 osteocytes (Fig. 5, p >0.4). These data indicate that QVD effects in the current studies are mediated through its anti-apoptotic action and not through any direct off-target effects on osteoclastogenesis and RANKL signaling.

Similarly in trabecular bone, treatment with the apoptosis inhibitor during HLU also prevented the increases in osteocyte apoptosis, osteocyte RANKL expression, and trabecular bone resorption (Fig. 7). Moreover, HLU-induced losses of trabecular bone volume and architecture were effectively prevented by treatment with the apoptosis inhibitor (Fig. 8). Fig. 6.

Inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis completely prevented HLU-induced bone loss (*p <0.05 versus Ctrl).Discussion The results of this study demonstrate that increases in resorption of both cortical and trabecular bone owing to hindlimb unloading in the femur are spatially and temporally associated with acutely increased levels of osteocyte apoptosis. These results are consistent with previous findings for the activation of bone resorption resulting from fatigue-induced microdamage and estrogen depletion in appendicular bone.(19,20,22) The current studies further show that HLU caused an increase in RANKL-expressing osteocytes and that these occurred in the same regions where osteocyte apoptosis was observed. We also found that when osteocyte apoptosis was prevented with a caspase inhibitor, the increases in the number of RANKL-positive osteocytes in the same regions of bone were also prevented. These observations are consistent with recent studies by Kennedy and colleagues,(22) who reported that pharmacological prevention of osteocyte apoptosis at microdamage sites also prevents triggering of RANKL expression by the viable neighboring osteocytes. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis prevented HLU-induced resorption increases in both cortical and cancellous bone. Indeed, cancellous bone loss in the femur after HLU was prevented by inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis. Increased osteocyte apoptosis in HLU preceded resorption, as it did in models of fatigue microdamage and estrogen depletion(5,19,20,45) and consistent with a role in triggering resorption. Yet although apoptotic cell numbers declined at 14 days in cortical bone, likely because of resorption of the tissue containing the apoptotic cells, the numbers of apoptotic cells remained high in trabecular bone. Because apoptotic cell degeneration is often rapid once effector caspases (like Caspase-3) are activated,(6,20) this finding suggests that new osteocytes undergo apoptosis throughout HLU, particularly in trabecular bone. The stimuli responsible for long-term propagation of apoptosis in HLU and the basis for the differences between cortical and trabecular bone have yet to be established. We also observed that the distribution of osteocyte apoptosis in the cortex in HLU was elevated in all anatomical regions of the femoral mid-diaphysis examined, a result that differs from the discrete, localized regions of osteocyte death found after estrogen withdrawal.(20) Why these distinct resorption-activating challenges result in such different patterns of osteocyte apoptosis remains obscure at this time. Nevertheless, some critical insights can be gleaned. A focal injury mechanism can readily explain increased osteocyte apoptosis at bone micro-damage sites, whereas the regional localization of osteocyte apoptosis after ovariectomy appears to reflect the combination of oxidative stress from estrogen loss superimposed on older osteocytes that are found in characteristic locations in mouse diaphyseal cortical bone.(20) In contrast, insufficient mechanical loading in disuse states like HLU leads to a more global impairment of fluid-solute transport to and from osteocytes in the lacunar-canalicular system (LCS) and consequently a generalized metabolic stress on all osteocytes in non-loaded bones.(47,48) It seems reasonable to posit that the more extensive circumferential distribution of apoptotic osteocytes throughout the femoral cortex, compared with the regionally localized osteocyte apoptosis found in estrogen loss and microdamage, reflects this global stress scenario. Osteocytes depend completely on pericellular fluid for solute transport, including oxygen, nutrition, signaling proteins, and waste removal. Solute movement in the LCS fluid is dependent on molecular size. Small solutes under 1 kDa, eg, steroid hormones, glucose, ATP, NO, CO2, and O2, move easily by diffusion in the fluid space; however, for larger molecules like cytokines, convective transport resulting from normal mechanical loading of bone is required.(47–51) Indeed, Gross and colleagues reported, using an ulnar-unloading model, that osteocyte HIF-1α expression, a cell stress marker, was acutely and uniformly elevated throughout the cortex, consistent with the idea of uniform stress on osteocytes from disuse.(52) Interestingly, Gross and colleagues also found that although increases of HIF-1α-expressing osteocytes were uniform around the cortex, osteocyte HIF-1α expression in disuse was greatest in intracortical regions closest to blood vessels and near the endocortical surface. In the current studies, we also found that the highest levels of osteocyte apoptosis in cortical bone with HLU were closest to the endocortical surface—the region of highest blood flow in the rodent cortex; changes in marrow cavity pressure and venous stasis in the marrow cavity occur with disuse.(53) That similar apoptotic levels do not occur for osteocytes nearer to the periosteal surface may indicate that their fluid transport system remains more effective in disuse, perhaps because of muscle contractions, which still operate during HLU.(54–56) Indeed, the presence of elevated osteocyte apoptosis in all anatomical regions suggests a uniform, distributed stress in bone resulting from disuse, whereas the greater number of apoptotic osteocytes near the endocortical surface in disuse may suggest that these osteocytes are more in need of growth factors and survival cytokines than those further deep in the bone matrix. Nakashima and colleagues(57) and Xiong and colleagues(58) demonstrated that RANKL from osteocytes is essential for normal bone resorption in growing mice, and its absence causes marked osteopetrosis. Kennedy and colleagues(21,22) showed that osteocyte apoptosis at microdamage sites in bone triggered increased RANKL expression in viable osteocytes neighboring the zone of apoptosis and that this RANKL upregulation in turn activated intracortical resorption. The current studies showing that osteocyte RANKL expression with disuse is also triggered by osteocyte apoptosis and that the increases in both osteocyte RANKL expression and HLU-induced bone resorption did not occur when osteocyte apoptosis was inhibited pharmacologically are fully consistent with those previously reported scenarios. Plotkin and colleagues(18) used a novel bisphosphonate to prevent osteocyte apoptosis in the lumbar vertebral bodies of HLU mice. They also found that preventing HLU-induced osteocyte death prevented the neighboring osteocytes from turning on RANKL production, consistent with the mechanisms reported by Kennedy and colleagues at bone microdamage sites(22) and with the results found in the current studies. However, in contrast to the current and previous investigations, Plotkin and colleagues did not find any attenuation of bone resorption in their studies. They observed increased RANKL production in marrow osteoblast lineage cells that were not affected by apoptosis inhibition and suggested that this RANKL source was the principal driver of resorption. In the current studies, we did not find RANKL staining increases in the osteoblastic cells of the cancellous compartment in distal femurs with HLU. There are several possible reasons for the discrepancy between the current results and those of Plotkin and collegues. First, different classes of drugs were used to inhibit osteocyte apoptosis; we used a well-established pan-caspase inhibitor,(19,22,39,40) which showed no effects on RANKL gene expression and osteoclastogenesis in our in vitro studies, whereas Plotkin and colleagues employed a novel bisphosphonate with anti-apoptotic properties. Further studies are needed to explore this possibility. More critical differences between these two studies are the biology and local mechanical loads that the bone study sites experienced. Plotkin and colleagues examined lumbar vertebrae, whereas in the current studies, we examined femurs. These two sites are elements of the axial and appendicular skeleton, respectively, with well-known differences in developmental, intrinsic remodeling rates and in the amounts of hematopoietic and fatty marrow they contain.(59,60) Moreover, there is a fundamental difference between the mechanical stimuli these two sites experience in the HLU model, and this may be key to explaining the very different results of these studies. Tail suspension in rodents was designed specifically to unload the hindlimbs. However, because mice and rats are suspended by their tails in HLU, the lumbar and caudal vertebrae and associated tissues experience dramatically elevated tensile and torsional forces(61) as the animal moves about the cage—forces that the rodent spine does not experience in normal mechanical loading. Indeed, Holguin and colleagues(62) found that HLU suspension causes loss of intervertebral disc volume, which is the opposite of the increases in disc volume found in astronauts during spaceflight and in subjects during bed-rest studies. In fact, these HLU changes are typical of rapid intervertebral disc degeneration,(62) and disc cells in degeneration produce a range of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17, that promote extracellular matrix degradation and also influence the adjacent vertebral bone.(63,64) The full ramifications of the altered loading of the caudal and lumbar spine in HLU remain to be elucidated. However, it is clear that the lumbar vertebrae do not see an unloaded environment like that experienced by the hindlimbs in HLU, and such biomechanical differences combined with the locally elevated levels of inflammatory regulators would certainly influence resorption responses in bone. In summary, the temporal and spatial coupling between osteocyte apoptosis and bone resorption after HLU strongly resemble that found in targeted remodeling of bone micro-damage and after estrogen loss in rodents.(19,20,22) In all cases, osteocyte apoptosis triggers a rise in the number of RANKL-positive osteocytes and subsequent increases in osteoclast recruitment, the effects of which are found in increased bone resorption. After 5 days of unloading, the numbers of apoptotic osteocytes were four times more than that of controls in both cortical and trabecular bone compartments. Similarly, increases in RANKL-positive osteocytes were also detected in these bone regions, and by day 14 of unloading, there were significant increases in bone resorption not observed after 5 days of HLU, and especially apparent in the bone volume fraction losses in the distal femur trabecular bone. Dramatically, inhibition of apoptosis completely prevented the increases in the numbers of apoptotic and RANKL-producing osteocytes and the bone loss associated with unloading, providing further support for the concept that osteocyte apoptosis is a common final pathway for activating and targeting bone resorption in response to diverse stimuli.(65)Acknowledgments Research reported in this article was supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under award numbers AR041210, AR057139, and AR060445 (to MBS) and NASA grant NASA NNX08BA35G (to SJ).

    "abstract": "Abstract The forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene expression and morphogenesis during early development. Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceflight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 g hypergravity (HG)/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced changes to their transcriptome.

    "introduction": "Introduction Differentiation, stem cell fate decisions and developmental patterning are regulated by a variety of spatiotemporal influences. The mechanical environment, defined by unit gravity on Earth, is one such influencer, modulating cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions via physical strain sensing through integrin and cadherin adhesion receptor signaling. These physical strains are then converted into cell signaling and transcriptional responses by a process termed mechanotransduction [1–3]. In a whole organism the tissue mechanical environment can be regulated by intrinsic factors such as blood pressure, muscle contraction, and others, or by extrinsic factors such as gravity weight-bearing and posture. Also, of importance are the cyclic nature of these normal loading and unloading processes. On Earth, mammalian tissues normal hydrostatic pressures due to vascular activity can vary in the range of 0.2–16 kPa, while pressures can go as high as 5–6 MPa in weight-bearing bone and cartilage and to 18 MPa while running or jumping [4]. However, the calculated hydrostatic pressure in a standard static mammalian laboratory cell culture (with a fluid medium with density of 1 kg/m3 and height of 1 cm, at 1 g) is only about 0.1 kPa, well below normal tissue physiological mechanical loading conditions. To simulate physiologically relevant ranges of mechanical loads in cell cultures, various strategies have been used including applying cyclic stretch [5], or pulses of hydrostatic pressure [6], and hypergravity (HG) [7], that often result in enhanced cellular proliferation and differentiation effects. In the unique environment of space, free fall-induced weightlessness can modulate the intrinsic factors of tissue mechanical environment leading to reduced mechanical loads in tissue niche environments [8]. Modeling the effects of microgravity on Earth has been attempted with a multitude of strategies; however, many of these strategies in an effort to replicate free fall, generate non-physiologic fluid shear and rotational loading to the cells [9]. The interesting observation that traditional static cell culture plating results in pressure loading well below the physiologically relevant range may provide a unique path for cellular level modeling of the microgravity free fall environment. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are primary stem cells that can be turned toward specific fates by exclusive modulation of mechanical environment [10,11]. However, these methods often induce ESC differentiation to a single cell type, removing the cultures from physiologic relevance. Embryoid bodies (EBs) are a three-dimensional (3D) model of embryo development inclusive of all pre-implant cell lineages and germ layers within 7–12 days, providing a physiologically relevant platform for regenerative medicine and developmental studies [12,13]. Investigations of 3D EB models exposed to mechanical perturbation are rare, and rarer still are transcriptomic characterization of mechanotransduction regulation of development. The most studied physical stress relevant to the EB model is fluid shear stress [14], imparted by spinner flasks [15] or microfluidic channels [16,17], or rotating wall vessels [9] used in their culture. Generally, these studies have shown that fluidic shear stress promotes growth and maturation; however, this general observation has been refined as the study of mechanical regulation of EBs has expanded. A 2010 study presented data that controlling the speed of hydrodynamic stimulation changes viability of the cells within the spheroid [18]. More direct stretch mechanical loading increases angiogenesis within the EB and increases the localization of beating cardiomyocyte foci [19]. Dynamic cyclic stretch to EBs encourages differentiation toward mesodermal lineages with the resulting terminal cell type selectable by manipulating the compressive and tensile strains [20]. As positive mechanical loading corresponds to increased differentiation commitment, reduced mechanical strain can be hypothesized to result in the maintenance of embryonic potency markers. Hanging drop and suspension EB cultures found increased apoptotic cell accumulations and irregular morphology in comparison to rotary fluid shear EB culture [21], although these may be explained by decreased mass transport around and inside EB. EBs space flown in low earth orbit for 15 days under microgravity conditions retained self-renewal markers and showed inhibition of ESC differentiation and germ layer lineage markers, however, upon return to earth-normal 1 g loading, the EBs demonstrated increased ability to readily differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes [22,23]. These results mirror findings that EBs derived from ESCs exposed to fluidic shear stress before aggregation are primed for differentiation, resulting in increased endothelial markers and spatial organization [24]. Mechanically regulated engineerability of developmental models has application in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine as self-organization and patterning are necessary for functional repair or replacement of tissue deficits. An intermediate step for development of many organoid models is induced pluripotent stem cell aggregation into EBs before additional chemical treatment [25], thus transcriptomic information from the EB stage could help improve fidelity of organoids and the research for which they are utilized. However, lack of a thorough understanding of transcriptomic regulation within difficult-to-access EB spheroids has hindered the development of the field. Novel single cell transcriptomic approaches are beginning to bridge this deficit with recent work describing pre-implantation embryos and in vitro EBs [26], germ layer developmental trajectory [27,28], and organoid efficacy assessment [29,30]. The use of single cell resolution has enabled detection of transient cell populations existing between established embryo staging, providing further insight into developmental programs, lineage decision omics and has exposed potential new cell classifications as targets for directed differentiation [27,28]. Our investigation utilizes single cell transcriptomics technology to probe how the absence of mechanical perturbation, similar to microgravity unloading, alters developmental programing in the EB model compared to a single pulse of physiologically relevant loading by HG.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods EB culture and gravity mechanostimulation Clonal C57BL/6J ESCs (ATCC SCRC-1002) were seeded at 3E6 cells in a 10 cm2 tissue culture dish coated with 0.1% gelatin (Fig. 1A). The mESCs were expanded for two passages in mESC medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 × nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% antibiotic solution [penicillin/streptomycin], trace beta-mercaptoethanol, and 10 ng/mL leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF]). The medium was changed daily and cells were passaged every 48 h using 0.25% trypsin solution and re-seeded at 3E6 cells per dish before reaching experimental maturity (Fig. 1A, C). After the second expansion, a subset of the mESCs (6E6 cells per dish) were transferred to an ultra-low adhesion 10 cm2 tissue culture dishes and LIF removed from the culture media to allow cells to aggregate and form EBs (Fig. 1B). Half of the media was changed daily and cell aggregation was inspected using a Leica DMi1 inverted light microscope. FIG. 1. Open in a new tab Sixty-minutes 50 g/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure loading pulse induces limited transcriptomic shift in ESC or EB model. Brightfield images of cultured mouse ESCs (A) and non-adherent day-5 EBs (B) show morphologic differences from the actin cytoskeleton (green) and DAPI nuclear (blue) florescent images of post-HG pulse ESCs (C) and day-9 adherent EBs (D). Experimental design for EB development and 60-min HG loading (E) and no-pulse control (F). (G) tSNE mapping show the HG pulse cause limited positional shifts for either the ESC or EB cells. However, the HG-EBs do show islets (positional shifts indicated by dashed encirclement) indicating mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later developmental states of cell commitment. 36.1% of all upregulated genes (H) and 27.4% of downregulated genes (I) are shared between ESCs and EBs. DAPI; EB, embryoid body; ESCs, embryonic stem cells; HG, hypergravity; tSNE, t-distributed stochastic neighbor.The EBs were cultured for 5-days before further processing. On the fifth day, EBs were seeded onto 0.1% (w/v) collagen coated platinum-treated silicon membranes and allowed to adhere and outgrow for 4 days (Fig. 1D). After the 4 days, the EB cultures and control mESC cultures were exposed to a 1-h HG pulse of 50 g in a cell culture 1 ft-diameter centrifuge. The acceleration level of 50 g used in this study with a 1 cm medium column above adherent cells results in a calculated hydrostatic pressure of about 5 kPa corresponding to a mid-range physiological value for mammalian non-load bearing tissues (P=ρgh, where ρ is the density of the medium in kilogram per cubic meter, g is gravity acceleration in meter per second squared, and h is the depth of the liquid in meter). Centrifugation was performed using a custom modified (vented lid) Eppendorf 5804 1 ft diameter rotor centrifuge with multi-well plate adapters inside an environmental chamber with 5% carbon dioxide, 37°C, and 90% humidity. After mechanostimulation, the cultures were continued for a further 6 h, allowing for transcriptomic response under static 1 g conditions. Single cell library preparation, sequencing, analysis, and visualization The EB and ESC cultures were dissociated into single cell suspension and prepared for 10 × Genomics RNA sequencing according to the Gene Expression Profiling v2 chemistry protocol (10 × Genomics). The four conditions evaluated were mESC control and HG mechanical pulse stimulated and EB control and HG mechanical pulse stimulated (respectively ESC_C, ESC_HG, EB_C, EB_HG). After Illumina sequencing, the samples were demultiplexed and analyzed using 10 × Genomics CellRanger software v4.0 to produce barcode, gene expression, and library identification matrices. These datasets were then assessed for clustering by Seurat and for developmental trajectory by Monocle 2 and 3 to produce our data visualizations in t-distributed stochastic neighbor (tSNE), uniform manifold approximation, and projection (UMAP) statistical and Pseudotime relationship mapping methods.

    "results": "Results 1/3 of mechanoregulated genes are shared between ESCs and day 9 EBs Single cell tSNE mapping of ESCs and EBs show that a 60-min HG pulse results in minimal deviation in cellular transcriptomic signature (Fig. 1G). Cell mapping shows that most ESC cells share general overlap between the HG pulse (red) and unstimulated controls (blue); However, HG pulse EB cells have areas in the tSNE space largely populated by HG pulse cells with minimal EB non-pulse control cells (Fig. 1G—area largely populated by HG pulse cells indicated by dashed encirclement). Assessing mechano-induced (Fig. 1J) or -suppressed (Fig. 1K) differentially expressed (DE) genes shared between ESCs and EBs show only ∼1/3 DE genes have common mechanoregulation. In response to HG pulse EBs show more upregulated genes than ESCs while ESCs and EBs have similar numbers of downregulated genes but fewer are shared. Gene ontology pathway analysis demonstrates HG pulse correlates differentiation and developmental programs to increased mechanotransduction signaling pathways When single cell expression information was assessed by Gene Ontology (GO) Consensus Pathway Analysis (CPA) [31] the DE genes were found to be related to developmental pathways, mechanotransduction, and genomic stress/repair mechanisms. Figure 2 presents the GO-CPA mapping and expression heatmaps for the highest DE genes from each pathway. The pathways presented are highly connected, indicating organized response to mechanical loading (Fig. 2A). HG pulse EBs DE genes show organized upregulation compared to no-pulse EBs expression while the HG pulse ESC cells show upregulation of many genes within the pathways but many also have no expression change, indicating cellular response to loading but not organized change in the population transcriptome (Fig. 2B–D). Genes associated with angiogenesis are the exception as ESCs cultured under HG pulse show organized upregulation of genes while the EBs do not. FIG. 2. Open in a new tab Pathway analysis shows HG pulse induces organized upregulation of multicellular organism developmental, mechanotransduction, and DNA stress/repair pathways. (A) CPA results show three main GO pathways differentially regulated by hypergravity pulse stimulation in developmental model: green-blue coloring labels developmental pathways; navy-yellow coloring labels mechanotransduction and signal transduction pathways; and magenta-orange coloring label DNA damage and repair mechanism pathways (see legend). (B–D) Expression mapping for key genes in representative nodes of each of the three key regulatory processes upregulated by mechanical stimulation in the developmental model. (B) Genes key to developmental pathways, (C) genes key to mechanotransduction and signal transduction, and (D) are genes key to DNA damage and repair mechanisms. Results demonstrate that HG stimulation induces upregulation of many pathway genes in both EB and ESC models. However, the EBs respond with the greatest number of upregulated genes per pathway and greatest upregulation of individual genes in response to hypergravity pulse. CPA, consensus pathway analysis; GO, gene ontology. HG pulse increases EB growth markers in extra-embryonic tissue cell types and pre- and post-implant epiblasts EB UMAP clustering shows little deviation in mathematical clustering due to HG pulse stimulation (Fig. 3A). Nine clusters are identified in both libraries with minimal mapping divergences. ESCs, pre- and post-implantation lineage, primitive endoderm, germ cells, and extra-embryonic cell general positions are identified within the UMAP space. Within the UMAP reference frame, the application of HG pulse changes the location of the extra-embryonic cells and cluster 9 is suppressed (indicated by grey boxes). Extra-embryonic cells are responsible for regulating implantation and development of the amnion and placental tissue, which are the first adherent cells affected by direct mechanical stimulation and the gene markers for the trophoblasts (cluster 1 markers include Efna1, Dab2, Pparg, and Krt18) and extraembryonic ectoderm (cluster 9—markers include Tfap2a, Hand1, Cdx2, Krt7, and Wnt6) have increased expression with HG pulse. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab HG pulse elicits greater expression of developmental markers but reduces cluster expression exclusivity in favor of more transitory cell phenotype. (A) UMAP clustering identifies nine clusters for both HG pulse and no-pulse control EBs. Two clusters identify as extra-embryonic tissues (gray boxes) and seven clusters identify along the three germ layer developmental program. General cell type locals are indicated for progenitor ESCs, pre- and post-implant epiblasts (pre-I and post-I epiblast respectively), PrE, and germ cell transcriptomic signatures. HG pulse reduces the separation of pre-implant epiblasts and primitive endoderm cells (indicated by hashed arrow). (B) Cluster-specific expression of developmental cell type markers show HG pulse increases occurrence of multiple cell type marker expression within a cluster, indicating more transitory phenotypes with HG pulse loading. PrE, primitive endoderm; UMAP, uniform manifold approximation and projection.Figure 3B visualizes representative marker genes of potency, ESC, primitive endoderm, pre- and post-implantation epiblast lineages. Cluster-specific assessment show high expression of the potency marker Oct4/Pou5f1 in all EB clusters irrespective of loading condition; However, clusters 5–9 show deviation in the level and normality of the Oct4 expression with HG pulse. Clusters 5–7 deviate toward greater expression with HG pulse, suggesting maintenance of potency features within these clusters. Clusters 8 and 9 have reduced expression, suggestive of stem/progenitor cell commitment to specialization. HG pulse increases transcriptomic signature of transitory cells ESC marker Esrrb is expressed in clusters 3 and 4 independent of HG pulse while clusters 5 and 7 express Esrrb exclusively under conditions of HG pulse. These data suggest maintenance of “stemness” transcriptomic qualities in cells of clusters 5 and 7 in response to HG pulse. Mapping and expression of Pre-Implant epiblast marker Tfap2c show expression in no-pulse control EB cells of clusters 4, 5, and 8. Co-expression of ESC marker Esrrb and Pre-Epiblast marker Tfap2c in cluster 4 indicate a transitory phenotype between ESC and Pre-Implant epiblast. The application of HG pulse induces co-expression of Esrrb and Tfap2c in clusters 5 and 7. This transcriptomic shift shows that HG pulse increases cells with ESC/Pre-Implant Epiblast transitory phenotype. In the non-pulse control EB cells clusters 5 and 8 express Tfap2c without corresponding ESC marker expression, defining these cells as non-transitory Epiblasts. Post-implant epiblast marker Dnmt3b shows co-expression with pre-implant epiblast clusters 5 and 8. HG pulse results in additional co-expression of Dnmt3b and Tfap2c in cluster 7 indicating increased pre- to post-implant epiblast transitory cells. Dnmt3b is expressed in clusters 2, 3, 5–8 of both libraries, implying the majority of cells at day 9 EB culture are post-implant epiblast transcriptionally identified cells, which is consistent with published literature [13,26]. Dmnt3b is expressed in cluster 9 of the no-pulse control EB cells but not the HG pulse cluster 9 cells, linking post-implant epiblasts to the extra-embryonic tissue and suggesting a branch point in the developmental program that is hidden in the single cell trajectory, by mechanism of silencing or acceleration through the developmental program by the HG pulse. Primitive endoderm marker Npl is present in cluster 6 of the no-pulse control cells and cluster 8 of the HG pulse EBs. The HG pulse cluster 8 identified primitive endoderm cells that show co-expression of pre- and post-implant epiblast markers. Location within the UMAP coordinate system demonstrates that HG pulse reduces the transcriptomic separation of pre-implant and primitive endoderm cells (distance indicated by dashed arrows in Fig. 3). These data show that early commitment lineages are regulated by the mechanical environment, and that specifically HG pulse stimulation causes transition of cells through the early developmental program. HG pulse introduces unique cell signatures but does not cause divergence from developmental trajectory in germ layer lineages To more closely examine how HG pulse influences cell transitory transcriptomic signature, Monocle 3 mapping assigned pseudotime scale to the non-pulse control EB UMAP and the HG pulse EB UMAP (Fig. 4A). The pseudotime mapping shows that the developmental tracing for the EB libraries is similar with HG pulse advancing pseudotime distance between the ESCs (cluster 3 cells identified as the start of the trajectory) and the terminal cells (ectoderm lineage). Monocle trajectory mapping was done to more directly identify developmental relationship of cells within the UMAP space (Fig. 4B). The developmental trajectory identifies several branch points unique to the HG pulse EB cells (Fig. 4C, grey boxes). FIG. 4. Open in a new tab Developmental trajectory of EBs stimulated with HG show more commitment to lineage differentiation and unique branching points responsible for cell fate decisions. (A) UMAP dimension colored for pseudotime scale show HG pulse advances cell commitment to developmental differentiation. (B) EB HG pulse and non-pulse cells mapped in the pseudotime coordinate system show the developmental trajectory of the non-extra-embryonic cells (gray boxes indicate cell carried into developmental trajectory analysis). (C) Phenotype identified cellular staging for progenitor ESCs (ESC), pre- and post-implant epiblasts (Pre-I and post-I respectively), PrE, and the Endo, Meso, and Ecto germ layers. Unique branching points for populations of senESC, cephalocaudal folding cells (Ceph-Caud), and PS cells. These phenotypes could not be segregated in the non-pulse control EBs; however, these are likely still present as the developmental trajectory of the EBs are not altered between control and HG pulse EBs. HG pulse moves the PrE cluster closer to ESCs along the developmental trajectory compared to control, indicating maintained progenitor potency in cells committed to later differentiation states. Ecto, ectoderm; Endo, endoderm; Meso, mesoderm; PS, primitive streak; senESC, senescent ESCs.Programmatically the first branch of cells to diverge from the main trajectory pathway, labeled as branch point 5 in the HG pulse trajectory map, was identified as senescent ESC (senESC) cell type due to high expression of ESC markers Oct4/Pou5f1, Esrrb, Zfp42, and Tcf15 in addition to higher expression of senescence marker Cdkn2a/P16. Branch point 1 cells present transcriptional signatures related to cephalocaudal folding (Ceph-Caud), showing co-expression of genes Atp4a, Foxj1, Nkx2, Ctnnb1, and Wnts, descriptive of foregut formation. At branch point 3, cells are transcriptomically identified as Primitive Streak (PS), which are transitory cells with transcriptomic signature similar to post-implantation epiblasts (Dnmt3b, Kif1a, Fgf5), markers consistent with developmental signaling (Wnts, Ctnnb1, Fgf8, T, Psmb8) and the of the three germ layer lineages (Spink1, Apob, Postn, Sox11, Pdgfc). These transcriptomically identified cells are positioned along the trajectory before the post-implant epiblast and endoderm branch point, again supporting that HG pulse encourages maintenance of diversity of transcriptional states by retention of cell markers associated with transitory stages.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Investigations of mechanical unloading during spaceflight in microgravity have demonstrated the maintenance of “stemness” in ESCs, developmental EB spheroids, and lineage specific stem cells [22,23,32,33]. In contrast positive dynamic loading studies have shown that mechanical stimulation induces upregulation of proliferative and specialization gene pathways via independent molecular mechanisms [5]. Our study demonstrated that a 60-min HG pulse in day 9 EBs results in limited divergence in cell type assignment and transcriptomic signature from traditional static culture EBs. Embryo development studies varying gravity environment in murine models have shown that stage of gestation when the gravity disturbance is applied is critical. NASA-.R1, NASA-.R2 studies assessed rat breeding pairs on-orbit finding that on-orbit breeding resulted in no viable pups; However, there were signs of early stage pregnancies in a small portion of the females [34]. Conversely, studies of 2 g HG during gestation did not interfere with mating or gestation [35] but 3 g resulted in no viable pupping. Another study conducted by Schenker and Forkheim, on early pregnancy mice found that spaceflight exposure resulted in failed gestation of pre-implantation embryos, however mid- or late stage embryos completed gestation without significant developmental deviation [36,37]. Assessment of the developing embryos for molecular mechanism of failed early-stage gestation identified decreased DNA repair mechanisms and increased identification of DNA damage response (DDR). These data correspond with findings of Lei et al., which found that blastocyte formation and quality were compromised by spaceflight by mechanisms similar to ground based low dose radiation [38]. Our investigation established that a pulse of HG loading increased DNA repair and apoptotic processes. These studies collectively suggesting a potential gravity regulated DDR pathway that may play a role in regulating how developmental cells respond to DNA damage, critical for the cell transition from pre- to post-implantation and gestation success. Our single cell study evaluated the transcriptomic change associated with a single physiologically relevant pulse of mechanical loading and demonstrated the load-unload dynamics result in increased developmental progression. Similarly, a recent parabolic flight study evaluated repeated micro- to hyper-gravity periodic loading [39] finding ESCs exposed to the 31 parabolas elicited downregulation of proliferation and cell cycle genes and upregulation of developmental/differentiation genes. Additionally, ESCs recovered from the parabolic gravity loading then cultured as EBs for a further 12 days showed elevated Gene Ontology/ Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways associated with skeletal, respiratory, blood vessels, liver, and nervous system and suppression of cardiac development pathways. Blaber et al., collected 15 day EBs on-orbit for gene expression profiling, finding inhibition of terminal germ layer lineage markers and decrease in mechanotransduction signaling and membrane spanning proteins [22]. These data providing further evidence that absence of normal mechanical loading may restrict developmental potential. Together these complementary studies provide strong evidence that gravity loading regulates mammalian developmental processes and stem cell specialization. It is possible, however, that synergistic effects between mechanical unloading during spaceflight and space radiation, as reported by Blaber et al., may also contribute to the observed effects. Future investigations should address this potential synergy by combining mechanical loading with particle accelerator-simulated relevant space radiation doses and dose rates. Finally, the single cell approach we used also allowed for mapping of the developmental program in a pseudotime coordinates system that models and orders temporal relationships between various gene expression states of cells in a population. Mapping EB development of the HG and unstimulated controls show cell populations are susceptible to “branching” cell fate decisions in response to gravity loading. Embryogenesis cell fate decisions are highly choreographed in response to cell–cell, cell–matrix, and cytokine signaling [40–42]. Because these cell fate decisions play a decisive role in execution of the developmental program, single cell may allow for more precise transcriptomic mapping of cell fate decisions based on transcriptomic similarity between cells [43,44]. Utilizing such methods to assess embryogenesis, investigations have found specificity of cell lineage tracing such as primordial germ cell tracing to pre-implant epiblasts [27] and definition of mid- to late-PS transitory transcriptomic signature [28]. Our single cell assessment of HG trajectory demonstrates that a positive gravity load induces branching of an inactive pluripotent population of ESC signature positive cells (Oct4+, Tcf15+, Gbx2+, etc.) with little to no cell cycle transcriptomic activity (cyclin/CDK complexes [45]), distinct from the starting ESC cell population. Our study also visualized branching points for cephalocaudal folding gene expression and PS signature cells between pre- and post-implant epiblast transition.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions This study offers a novel assessment of how in vitro ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by a positive pulse of gravity loading at single cell resolution. Specifically, we show that a 60-min 50 g/5 kPa HG pulse resulted in cells during early development maintaining transitory phenotypes, and having enhanced expression of germ layer lineage markers. This study further defines the power of gravity loading in regulating stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by identification of transcriptomic patterns in stem cells and developmental processes, which can aid in understanding how gravity can be leveraged to elicit regenerative responses; benefiting in vitro platforms for organoid tissue culture, and regenerative medicine.",

Copyright notice ID: 9293686 PMID: 35570697 Abstract The forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene expression and morphogenesis during early development. Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceflight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 g hypergravity (HG)/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced changes to their transcriptome. Keywords: mechanotransduction, embryoid bodies, embryonic stem cells, single cell RNA sequencing, developmentIntroduction Differentiation, stem cell fate decisions and developmental patterning are regulated by a variety of spatiotemporal influences. The mechanical environment, defined by unit gravity on Earth, is one such influencer, modulating cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions via physical strain sensing through integrin and cadherin adhesion receptor signaling. These physical strains are then converted into cell signaling and transcriptional responses by a process termed mechanotransduction [1–3]. In a whole organism the tissue mechanical environment can be regulated by intrinsic factors such as blood pressure, muscle contraction, and others, or by extrinsic factors such as gravity weight-bearing and posture. Also, of importance are the cyclic nature of these normal loading and unloading processes. On Earth, mammalian tissues normal hydrostatic pressures due to vascular activity can vary in the range of 0.2–16 kPa, while pressures can go as high as 5–6 MPa in weight-bearing bone and cartilage and to 18 MPa while running or jumping [4]. However, the calculated hydrostatic pressure in a standard static mammalian laboratory cell culture (with a fluid medium with density of 1 kg/m3 and height of 1 cm, at 1 g) is only about 0.1 kPa, well below normal tissue physiological mechanical loading conditions. To simulate physiologically relevant ranges of mechanical loads in cell cultures, various strategies have been used including applying cyclic stretch [5], or pulses of hydrostatic pressure [6], and hypergravity (HG) [7], that often result in enhanced cellular proliferation and differentiation effects. In the unique environment of space, free fall-induced weightlessness can modulate the intrinsic factors of tissue mechanical environment leading to reduced mechanical loads in tissue niche environments [8]. Modeling the effects of microgravity on Earth has been attempted with a multitude of strategies; however, many of these strategies in an effort to replicate free fall, generate non-physiologic fluid shear and rotational loading to the cells [9]. The interesting observation that traditional static cell culture plating results in pressure loading well below the physiologically relevant range may provide a unique path for cellular level modeling of the microgravity free fall environment. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are primary stem cells that can be turned toward specific fates by exclusive modulation of mechanical environment [10,11]. However, these methods often induce ESC differentiation to a single cell type, removing the cultures from physiologic relevance. Embryoid bodies (EBs) are a three-dimensional (3D) model of embryo development inclusive of all pre-implant cell lineages and germ layers within 7–12 days, providing a physiologically relevant platform for regenerative medicine and developmental studies [12,13]. Investigations of 3D EB models exposed to mechanical perturbation are rare, and rarer still are transcriptomic characterization of mechanotransduction regulation of development. The most studied physical stress relevant to the EB model is fluid shear stress [14], imparted by spinner flasks [15] or microfluidic channels [16,17], or rotating wall vessels [9] used in their culture. Generally, these studies have shown that fluidic shear stress promotes growth and maturation; however, this general observation has been refined as the study of mechanical regulation of EBs has expanded. A 2010 study presented data that controlling the speed of hydrodynamic stimulation changes viability of the cells within the spheroid [18]. More direct stretch mechanical loading increases angiogenesis within the EB and increases the localization of beating cardiomyocyte foci [19]. Dynamic cyclic stretch to EBs encourages differentiation toward mesodermal lineages with the resulting terminal cell type selectable by manipulating the compressive and tensile strains [20]. As positive mechanical loading corresponds to increased differentiation commitment, reduced mechanical strain can be hypothesized to result in the maintenance of embryonic potency markers. Hanging drop and suspension EB cultures found increased apoptotic cell accumulations and irregular morphology in comparison to rotary fluid shear EB culture [21], although these may be explained by decreased mass transport around and inside EB. EBs space flown in low earth orbit for 15 days under microgravity conditions retained self-renewal markers and showed inhibition of ESC differentiation and germ layer lineage markers, however, upon return to earth-normal 1 g loading, the EBs demonstrated increased ability to readily differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes [22,23]. These results mirror findings that EBs derived from ESCs exposed to fluidic shear stress before aggregation are primed for differentiation, resulting in increased endothelial markers and spatial organization [24]. Mechanically regulated engineerability of developmental models has application in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine as self-organization and patterning are necessary for functional repair or replacement of tissue deficits. An intermediate step for development of many organoid models is induced pluripotent stem cell aggregation into EBs before additional chemical treatment [25], thus transcriptomic information from the EB stage could help improve fidelity of organoids and the research for which they are utilized. However, lack of a thorough understanding of transcriptomic regulation within difficult-to-access EB spheroids has hindered the development of the field. Novel single cell transcriptomic approaches are beginning to bridge this deficit with recent work describing pre-implantation embryos and in vitro EBs [26], germ layer developmental trajectory [27,28], and organoid efficacy assessment [29,30]. The use of single cell resolution has enabled detection of transient cell populations existing between established embryo staging, providing further insight into developmental programs, lineage decision omics and has exposed potential new cell classifications as targets for directed differentiation [27,28]. Our investigation utilizes single cell transcriptomics technology to probe how the absence of mechanical perturbation, similar to microgravity unloading, alters developmental programing in the EB model compared to a single pulse of physiologically relevant loading by HG.Materials and Methods EB culture and gravity mechanostimulation Clonal C57BL/6J ESCs (ATCC SCRC-1002) were seeded at 3E6 cells in a 10 cm2 tissue culture dish coated with 0.1% gelatin (Fig. 1A). The mESCs were expanded for two passages in mESC medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 × nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% antibiotic solution [penicillin/streptomycin], trace beta-mercaptoethanol, and 10 ng/mL leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF]). The medium was changed daily and cells were passaged every 48 h using 0.25% trypsin solution and re-seeded at 3E6 cells per dish before reaching experimental maturity (Fig. 1A, C). After the second expansion, a subset of the mESCs (6E6 cells per dish) were transferred to an ultra-low adhesion 10 cm2 tissue culture dishes and LIF removed from the culture media to allow cells to aggregate and form EBs (Fig. 1B). Half of the media was changed daily and cell aggregation was inspected using a Leica DMi1 inverted light microscope. FIG. 1. Open in a new tab Sixty-minutes 50 g/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure loading pulse induces limited transcriptomic shift in ESC or EB model. Brightfield images of cultured mouse ESCs (A) and non-adherent day-5 EBs (B) show morphologic differences from the actin cytoskeleton (green) and DAPI nuclear (blue) florescent images of post-HG pulse ESCs (C) and day-9 adherent EBs (D). Experimental design for EB development and 60-min HG loading (E) and no-pulse control (F). (G) tSNE mapping show the HG pulse cause limited positional shifts for either the ESC or EB cells. However, the HG-EBs do show islets (positional shifts indicated by dashed encirclement) indicating mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later developmental states of cell commitment. 36.1% of all upregulated genes (H) and 27.4% of downregulated genes (I) are shared between ESCs and EBs. DAPI; EB, embryoid body; ESCs, embryonic stem cells; HG, hypergravity; tSNE, t-distributed stochastic neighbor.The EBs were cultured for 5-days before further processing. On the fifth day, EBs were seeded onto 0.1% (w/v) collagen coated platinum-treated silicon membranes and allowed to adhere and outgrow for 4 days (Fig. 1D). After the 4 days, the EB cultures and control mESC cultures were exposed to a 1-h HG pulse of 50 g in a cell culture 1 ft-diameter centrifuge. The acceleration level of 50 g used in this study with a 1 cm medium column above adherent cells results in a calculated hydrostatic pressure of about 5 kPa corresponding to a mid-range physiological value for mammalian non-load bearing tissues (P=ρgh, where ρ is the density of the medium in kilogram per cubic meter, g is gravity acceleration in meter per second squared, and h is the depth of the liquid in meter). Centrifugation was performed using a custom modified (vented lid) Eppendorf 5804 1 ft diameter rotor centrifuge with multi-well plate adapters inside an environmental chamber with 5% carbon dioxide, 37°C, and 90% humidity. After mechanostimulation, the cultures were continued for a further 6 h, allowing for transcriptomic response under static 1 g conditions.Single cell library preparation, sequencing, analysis, and visualization The EB and ESC cultures were dissociated into single cell suspension and prepared for 10 × Genomics RNA sequencing according to the Gene Expression Profiling v2 chemistry protocol (10 × Genomics). The four conditions evaluated were mESC control and HG mechanical pulse stimulated and EB control and HG mechanical pulse stimulated (respectively ESC_C, ESC_HG, EB_C, EB_HG). After Illumina sequencing, the samples were demultiplexed and analyzed using 10 × Genomics CellRanger software v4.0 to produce barcode, gene expression, and library identification matrices. These datasets were then assessed for clustering by Seurat and for developmental trajectory by Monocle 2 and 3 to produce our data visualizations in t-distributed stochastic neighbor (tSNE), uniform manifold approximation, and projection (UMAP) statistical and Pseudotime relationship mapping methods. Additional details in Supplemental Methodologies (Supplementary Data).Results 1/3 of mechanoregulated genes are shared between ESCs and day 9 EBs Single cell tSNE mapping of ESCs and EBs show that a 60-min HG pulse results in minimal deviation in cellular transcriptomic signature (Fig. 1G). Cell mapping shows that most ESC cells share general overlap between the HG pulse (red) and unstimulated controls (blue); However, HG pulse EB cells have areas in the tSNE space largely populated by HG pulse cells with minimal EB non-pulse control cells (Fig. 1G—area largely populated by HG pulse cells indicated by dashed encirclement). Assessing mechano-induced (Fig. 1J) or -suppressed (Fig. 1K) differentially expressed (DE) genes shared between ESCs and EBs show only ∼1/3 DE genes have common mechanoregulation. In response to HG pulse EBs show more upregulated genes than ESCs while ESCs and EBs have similar numbers of downregulated genes but fewer are shared.Gene ontology pathway analysis demonstrates HG pulse correlates differentiation and developmental programs to increased mechanotransduction signaling pathways When single cell expression information was assessed by Gene Ontology (GO) Consensus Pathway Analysis (CPA) [31] the DE genes were found to be related to developmental pathways, mechanotransduction, and genomic stress/repair mechanisms. Figure 2 presents the GO-CPA mapping and expression heatmaps for the highest DE genes from each pathway. The pathways presented are highly connected, indicating organized response to mechanical loading (Fig. 2A). HG pulse EBs DE genes show organized upregulation compared to no-pulse EBs expression while the HG pulse ESC cells show upregulation of many genes within the pathways but many also have no expression change, indicating cellular response to loading but not organized change in the population transcriptome (Fig. 2B–D). Genes associated with angiogenesis are the exception as ESCs cultured under HG pulse show organized upregulation of genes while the EBs do not. FIG. 2. Open in a new tab Pathway analysis shows HG pulse induces organized upregulation of multicellular organism developmental, mechanotransduction, and DNA stress/repair pathways. (A) CPA results show three main GO pathways differentially regulated by hypergravity pulse stimulation in developmental model: green-blue coloring labels developmental pathways; navy-yellow coloring labels mechanotransduction and signal transduction pathways; and magenta-orange coloring label DNA damage and repair mechanism pathways (see legend). (B–D) Expression mapping for key genes in representative nodes of each of the three key regulatory processes upregulated by mechanical stimulation in the developmental model. (B) Genes key to developmental pathways, (C) genes key to mechanotransduction and signal transduction, and (D) are genes key to DNA damage and repair mechanisms. Results demonstrate that HG stimulation induces upregulation of many pathway genes in both EB and ESC models. However, the EBs respond with the greatest number of upregulated genes per pathway and greatest upregulation of individual genes in response to hypergravity pulse. CPA, consensus pathway analysis; GO, gene ontology.HG pulse increases EB growth markers in extra-embryonic tissue cell types and pre- and post-implant epiblasts EB UMAP clustering shows little deviation in mathematical clustering due to HG pulse stimulation (Fig. 3A). Nine clusters are identified in both libraries with minimal mapping divergences. ESCs, pre- and post-implantation lineage, primitive endoderm, germ cells, and extra-embryonic cell general positions are identified within the UMAP space. Within the UMAP reference frame, the application of HG pulse changes the location of the extra-embryonic cells and cluster 9 is suppressed (indicated by grey boxes). Extra-embryonic cells are responsible for regulating implantation and development of the amnion and placental tissue, which are the first adherent cells affected by direct mechanical stimulation and the gene markers for the trophoblasts (cluster 1 markers include Efna1, Dab2, Pparg, and Krt18) and extraembryonic ectoderm (cluster 9—markers include Tfap2a, Hand1, Cdx2, Krt7, and Wnt6) have increased expression with HG pulse. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab HG pulse elicits greater expression of developmental markers but reduces cluster expression exclusivity in favor of more transitory cell phenotype. (A) UMAP clustering identifies nine clusters for both HG pulse and no-pulse control EBs. Two clusters identify as extra-embryonic tissues (gray boxes) and seven clusters identify along the three germ layer developmental program. General cell type locals are indicated for progenitor ESCs, pre- and post-implant epiblasts (pre-I and post-I epiblast respectively), PrE, and germ cell transcriptomic signatures. HG pulse reduces the separation of pre-implant epiblasts and primitive endoderm cells (indicated by hashed arrow). (B) Cluster-specific expression of developmental cell type markers show HG pulse increases occurrence of multiple cell type marker expression within a cluster, indicating more transitory phenotypes with HG pulse loading. PrE, primitive endoderm; UMAP, uniform manifold approximation and projection.Figure 3B visualizes representative marker genes of potency, ESC, primitive endoderm, pre- and post-implantation epiblast lineages. Cluster-specific assessment show high expression of the potency marker Oct4/Pou5f1 in all EB clusters irrespective of loading condition; However, clusters 5–9 show deviation in the level and normality of the Oct4 expression with HG pulse. Clusters 5–7 deviate toward greater expression with HG pulse, suggesting maintenance of potency features within these clusters. Clusters 8 and 9 have reduced expression, suggestive of stem/progenitor cell commitment to specialization.HG pulse increases transcriptomic signature of transitory cells ESC marker Esrrb is expressed in clusters 3 and 4 independent of HG pulse while clusters 5 and 7 express Esrrb exclusively under conditions of HG pulse. These data suggest maintenance of “stemness” transcriptomic qualities in cells of clusters 5 and 7 in response to HG pulse. Mapping and expression of Pre-Implant epiblast marker Tfap2c show expression in no-pulse control EB cells of clusters 4, 5, and 8. Co-expression of ESC marker Esrrb and Pre-Epiblast marker Tfap2c in cluster 4 indicate a transitory phenotype between ESC and Pre-Implant epiblast. The application of HG pulse induces co-expression of Esrrb and Tfap2c in clusters 5 and 7. This transcriptomic shift shows that HG pulse increases cells with ESC/Pre-Implant Epiblast transitory phenotype. In the non-pulse control EB cells clusters 5 and 8 express Tfap2c without corresponding ESC marker expression, defining these cells as non-transitory Epiblasts. Post-implant epiblast marker Dnmt3b shows co-expression with pre-implant epiblast clusters 5 and 8. HG pulse results in additional co-expression of Dnmt3b and Tfap2c in cluster 7 indicating increased pre- to post-implant epiblast transitory cells. Dnmt3b is expressed in clusters 2, 3, 5–8 of both libraries, implying the majority of cells at day 9 EB culture are post-implant epiblast transcriptionally identified cells, which is consistent with published literature [13,26]. Dmnt3b is expressed in cluster 9 of the no-pulse control EB cells but not the HG pulse cluster 9 cells, linking post-implant epiblasts to the extra-embryonic tissue and suggesting a branch point in the developmental program that is hidden in the single cell trajectory, by mechanism of silencing or acceleration through the developmental program by the HG pulse. Primitive endoderm marker Npl is present in cluster 6 of the no-pulse control cells and cluster 8 of the HG pulse EBs. The HG pulse cluster 8 identified primitive endoderm cells that show co-expression of pre- and post-implant epiblast markers. Location within the UMAP coordinate system demonstrates that HG pulse reduces the transcriptomic separation of pre-implant and primitive endoderm cells (distance indicated by dashed arrows in Fig. 3). These data show that early commitment lineages are regulated by the mechanical environment, and that specifically HG pulse stimulation causes transition of cells through the early developmental program.HG pulse introduces unique cell signatures but does not cause divergence from developmental trajectory in germ layer lineages To more closely examine how HG pulse influences cell transitory transcriptomic signature, Monocle 3 mapping assigned pseudotime scale to the non-pulse control EB UMAP and the HG pulse EB UMAP (Fig. 4A). The pseudotime mapping shows that the developmental tracing for the EB libraries is similar with HG pulse advancing pseudotime distance between the ESCs (cluster 3 cells identified as the start of the trajectory) and the terminal cells (ectoderm lineage). Monocle trajectory mapping was done to more directly identify developmental relationship of cells within the UMAP space (Fig. 4B). The developmental trajectory identifies several branch points unique to the HG pulse EB cells (Fig. 4C, grey boxes). FIG. 4. Open in a new tab Developmental trajectory of EBs stimulated with HG show more commitment to lineage differentiation and unique branching points responsible for cell fate decisions. (A) UMAP dimension colored for pseudotime scale show HG pulse advances cell commitment to developmental differentiation. (B) EB HG pulse and non-pulse cells mapped in the pseudotime coordinate system show the developmental trajectory of the non-extra-embryonic cells (gray boxes indicate cell carried into developmental trajectory analysis). (C) Phenotype identified cellular staging for progenitor ESCs (ESC), pre- and post-implant epiblasts (Pre-I and post-I respectively), PrE, and the Endo, Meso, and Ecto germ layers. Unique branching points for populations of senESC, cephalocaudal folding cells (Ceph-Caud), and PS cells. These phenotypes could not be segregated in the non-pulse control EBs; however, these are likely still present as the developmental trajectory of the EBs are not altered between control and HG pulse EBs. HG pulse moves the PrE cluster closer to ESCs along the developmental trajectory compared to control, indicating maintained progenitor potency in cells committed to later differentiation states. Ecto, ectoderm; Endo, endoderm; Meso, mesoderm; PS, primitive streak; senESC, senescent ESCs.Programmatically the first branch of cells to diverge from the main trajectory pathway, labeled as branch point 5 in the HG pulse trajectory map, was identified as senescent ESC (senESC) cell type due to high expression of ESC markers Oct4/Pou5f1, Esrrb, Zfp42, and Tcf15 in addition to higher expression of senescence marker Cdkn2a/P16. Branch point 1 cells present transcriptional signatures related to cephalocaudal folding (Ceph-Caud), showing co-expression of genes Atp4a, Foxj1, Nkx2, Ctnnb1, and Wnts, descriptive of foregut formation. At branch point 3, cells are transcriptomically identified as Primitive Streak (PS), which are transitory cells with transcriptomic signature similar to post-implantation epiblasts (Dnmt3b, Kif1a, Fgf5), markers consistent with developmental signaling (Wnts, Ctnnb1, Fgf8, T, Psmb8) and the of the three germ layer lineages (Spink1, Apob, Postn, Sox11, Pdgfc). These transcriptomically identified cells are positioned along the trajectory before the post-implant epiblast and endoderm branch point, again supporting that HG pulse encourages maintenance of diversity of transcriptional states by retention of cell markers associated with transitory stages.Discussion Investigations of mechanical unloading during spaceflight in microgravity have demonstrated the maintenance of “stemness” in ESCs, developmental EB spheroids, and lineage specific stem cells [22,23,32,33]. In contrast positive dynamic loading studies have shown that mechanical stimulation induces upregulation of proliferative and specialization gene pathways via independent molecular mechanisms [5]. Our study demonstrated that a 60-min HG pulse in day 9 EBs results in limited divergence in cell type assignment and transcriptomic signature from traditional static culture EBs. Embryo development studies varying gravity environment in murine models have shown that stage of gestation when the gravity disturbance is applied is critical. NASA-.R1, NASA-.R2 studies assessed rat breeding pairs on-orbit finding that on-orbit breeding resulted in no viable pups; However, there were signs of early stage pregnancies in a small portion of the females [34]. Conversely, studies of 2 g HG during gestation did not interfere with mating or gestation [35] but 3 g resulted in no viable pupping. Another study conducted by Schenker and Forkheim, on early pregnancy mice found that spaceflight exposure resulted in failed gestation of pre-implantation embryos, however mid- or late stage embryos completed gestation without significant developmental deviation [36,37]. Assessment of the developing embryos for molecular mechanism of failed early-stage gestation identified decreased DNA repair mechanisms and increased identification of DNA damage response (DDR). These data correspond with findings of Lei et al., which found that blastocyte formation and quality were compromised by spaceflight by mechanisms similar to ground based low dose radiation [38]. Our investigation established that a pulse of HG loading increased DNA repair and apoptotic processes. These studies collectively suggesting a potential gravity regulated DDR pathway that may play a role in regulating how developmental cells respond to DNA damage, critical for the cell transition from pre- to post-implantation and gestation success. Our single cell study evaluated the transcriptomic change associated with a single physiologically relevant pulse of mechanical loading and demonstrated the load-unload dynamics result in increased developmental progression. Similarly, a recent parabolic flight study evaluated repeated micro- to hyper-gravity periodic loading [39] finding ESCs exposed to the 31 parabolas elicited downregulation of proliferation and cell cycle genes and upregulation of developmental/differentiation genes. Additionally, ESCs recovered from the parabolic gravity loading then cultured as EBs for a further 12 days showed elevated Gene Ontology/ Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways associated with skeletal, respiratory, blood vessels, liver, and nervous system and suppression of cardiac development pathways. Blaber et al., collected 15 day EBs on-orbit for gene expression profiling, finding inhibition of terminal germ layer lineage markers and decrease in mechanotransduction signaling and membrane spanning proteins [22]. These data providing further evidence that absence of normal mechanical loading may restrict developmental potential. Together these complementary studies provide strong evidence that gravity loading regulates mammalian developmental processes and stem cell specialization. It is possible, however, that synergistic effects between mechanical unloading during spaceflight and space radiation, as reported by Blaber et al., may also contribute to the observed effects. Future investigations should address this potential synergy by combining mechanical loading with particle accelerator-simulated relevant space radiation doses and dose rates. Finally, the single cell approach we used also allowed for mapping of the developmental program in a pseudotime coordinates system that models and orders temporal relationships between various gene expression states of cells in a population. Mapping EB development of the HG and unstimulated controls show cell populations are susceptible to “branching” cell fate decisions in response to gravity loading. Embryogenesis cell fate decisions are highly choreographed in response to cell–cell, cell–matrix, and cytokine signaling [40–42]. Because these cell fate decisions play a decisive role in execution of the developmental program, single cell may allow for more precise transcriptomic mapping of cell fate decisions based on transcriptomic similarity between cells [43,44]. Utilizing such methods to assess embryogenesis, investigations have found specificity of cell lineage tracing such as primordial germ cell tracing to pre-implant epiblasts [27] and definition of mid- to late-PS transitory transcriptomic signature [28]. Our single cell assessment of HG trajectory demonstrates that a positive gravity load induces branching of an inactive pluripotent population of ESC signature positive cells (Oct4+, Tcf15+, Gbx2+, etc.) with little to no cell cycle transcriptomic activity (cyclin/CDK complexes [45]), distinct from the starting ESC cell population. Our study also visualized branching points for cephalocaudal folding gene expression and PS signature cells between pre- and post-implant epiblast transition.Conclusions This study offers a novel assessment of how in vitro ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by a positive pulse of gravity loading at single cell resolution. Specifically, we show that a 60-min 50 g/5 kPa HG pulse resulted in cells during early development maintaining transitory phenotypes, and having enhanced expression of germ layer lineage markers. This study further defines the power of gravity loading in regulating stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by identification of transcriptomic patterns in stem cells and developmental processes, which can aid in understanding how gravity can be leveraged to elicit regenerative responses; benefiting in vitro platforms for organoid tissue culture, and regenerative medicine.Supplementary Material Supplemental data Suppl_Data.docx (22.8KB, docx) Acknowledgments The authors thank NASA GeneLab Sequencing Group at NASA Ames Research Center (Moffett Field, CA, USA), including V.

    "title": "Macrophages inhibit Aspergillus fumigatus germination and neutrophil-mediated fungal killing.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6091969/",
    "abstract": "Abstract In immunocompromised individuals, Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive fungal disease that is often difficult to treat. Exactly how immune mechanisms control A. fumigatus in immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to different A. fumigatus strains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10 pyrG-deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection. Altogether, we describe a new role for macrophages in the persistence of A. fumigatus and highlight the ability of different A. fumigatus strains to adopt diverse modes of virulence.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Humans inhale hundreds of Aspergillus fumigatus spores from the environment every day and yet almost all immunocompetent individuals successfully contend with the fungal infection. Immunocompromised patients, however, especially acute leukemia patients, hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, and solid-organ transplant recipients, are at risk of developing invasive aspergillosis [1]. In invasive disease, Aspergillus spores germinate into filamentous hyphae and invade and destroy tissues and organs, with mortality rates as high as 50 to 60% in patient populations [1]. Limited antifungal treatments exist and there is growing resistance among fungi to these drugs [2]. The development of successful immunotherapy-based treatments to this infection requires a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay of immune mechanisms that control Aspergillus in vivo. In immunocompetent individuals, the innate immune system is generally sufficient for A. fumigatus clearance, with both macrophages and neutrophils playing major roles [3]. Macrophages primarily target and phagocytose conidia (spores), and can kill conidia in vitro within hours [4, 5]. In vivo, however, the requirement for and role of macrophages is unclear, with some studies reporting no effect on survival in macrophage-depleted mice [6] and others demonstrating an increased fungal burden in such mice [7]. Neutrophils, on the other hand, are consistently required in mice in response to Aspergillus [6, 8], and neutropenia is a key risk factor for patients in the development of invasive aspergillosis [9]. Neutrophils can kill conidia in vivo [10] and inhibit conidial germination both in vitro and in vivo [11, 12]. Immune cell populations can also influence the activity of other immune cell types, and CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes can increase neutrophil function in response to Aspergillus through pro-inflammatory gene expression [13, 14]. However, the full extent of macrophage/monocyte and neutrophil interactions throughout the course of infection, and their effect on fungal growth and clearance, are not known. Perhaps the most important step in Aspergillus pathogenesis is germination, the developmental switch from resting, dormant conidia to filamentous, invasive growth [15]. These different fungal forms induce differential activation of immune cells in vitro and recruitment of these cells in vivo [16–18]. After invasive hyphae have developed, neutrophils can respond with a variety of killing mechanisms [11, 19–21]. However, how this switch, and specifically earlier stages of fungal germination prior to the development of extensive invasive growth, affects immune activation, fungal clearance, and disease progression in vivo is largely unknown. Larval zebrafish provide an ideal model in which to study the early effects of fungal germination as well as the interplay between multiple immune cell types throughout infection. Larval zebrafish are transparent and can be non-invasively imaged and therefore allow for visualization of innate immune cell behavior and fungal development in a live, intact host throughout a multi-day infection. While murine models require enormous fungal inoculums (~107 conidia) and host immunosuppression in order to directly visualize immune cell-pathogen encounters within the context of host tissue, the larval zebrafish allows for visualization of smaller doses (10–100 conidia) in wild-type hosts [22]. Aspergillus infection models in zebrafish have already been developed by our lab and others and recapitulate many aspects of human and mouse infection, including initial phagocytosis of conidia by macrophages and post-germination neutrophil recruitment [21, 23]. These models have already provided new insight into the biology of immune responses to Aspergillus such as the observation of spore transfer between macrophages [24]. In this study, we have infected larval zebrafish with Aspergillus fumigatus strains derived from patient isolates Af293 and CEA10. Heterogeneity among A. fumigatus isolates has been increasingly recognized [25], and Af293 and CEA10 in particular are known to be differentially virulent in specific mouse and zebrafish models [26–28]. The genomes of these strains differ by ~50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which is an approximately average level of genetic diversity among sequenced A. fumigatus isolates [28]. Af293 and CEA10 strains also possess differences in growth [27], activation of the host immune response [27, 29], response to hypoxia [26], secondary metabolism [30, 31], and response to light [32]. We aimed to use these two different strains coupled with live imaging in larval zebrafish to identify and characterize differential neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to A. fumigatus infection. We report that while CEA10 is generally regarded as more virulent than Af293 [26, 27], CEA10-derived strains are killed better than Af293-derived strains in vivo, even while CEA10-derived strains germinate faster. Host inflammatory activation, partially through Myd88, is required for clearance of a CEA10-derived strain, but strikingly, is not sufficient for clearance of an Af293-derived strain. Macrophages only marginally contribute to clearance of CEA10-derived strains. Instead, macrophages primarily provide a protective niche for spores, forming tight, dense clusters around the fungus, inhibiting spore germination. Our data demonstrate that germination actually drives fungal clearance through neutrophil-mediated killing.",
    "methods": "Methods Ethics statement Animal care and use protocol M005405-A02 was approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS) Animal Care and Use Committee. This protocol adheres to the federal Health Research Extension Act and the Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, overseen by the National Institutes of Health () Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW). Zebrafish lines and maintenance All zebrafish were maintained as described previously [56]. Prior to any experimental manipulation, larvae were anesthetized in E3 water containing 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate, Sigma). All zebrafish lines used in this study are listed in Table 1. Previously published lines were genotyped as described in referenced publications. To generate lyz:BFP larvae, BFP was amplified by PCR (F: 5’-cagtgatacaggtacctcgccaccatgagcgagctgattaagg-3’, R: 5’-ctgattatgatctagatcacttgtgccccagtttgctagg-3’) and inserted by In-Fusion HD Cloning (Clontech) into a Tol2-lyz vector [60, 61] cut with KpnI/XbaI. ~90 pg of Tol2 plasmid was micro-injected with 75 pg of transposase mRNA into embryos at the single cell stage. mRNA was in vitro transcribed (mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit, Ambion) from a pCS2-transposase vector [62]. Larvae were screened for BFP expression in neutrophils at 2–3 days post fertilization (dpf) and grown up to establish a stable line. Table 1. Zebrafish lines used in this study. Line name Reference myd88-/- [57] irf8-/- [38] Tg(NF-κB RE:GFP) [33] Tg(lyz:BFP) This study Tg(mpeg1:H2B-mCherry) [56] Tg(mfap4:tomato-caax) [58] Tg(mpx:mCherry-2A-rac2D57N) [37] Tg(mpx:mCherry-2A-rac2WT) [37] Tg(mpx:mCherry) [59] Open in a new tab Morpholino injections Previously published and established splice-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides (MO, GeneTools) were re-suspended in water to a stock concentration of 1 mM. MOs were then diluted in water with 0.5X CutSmart Buffer (NEB) and 0.1% phenol red and 3 nl was micro-injected into single-cell stage embryos. Injected concentrations of morpholinos were 0.4 mM (irf8 (ZFIN MO1: aatgtttcgcttactttgaaaatgg)[63]), 0.5 mM (pu.1 (ZFIN MO1: gatatactgatactccattggtggt)[64]), and 0.33 mM (myd88 (ZFIN MO2: gttaaacactgaccctgtggatcat)[65]). These injected amounts of irf8 and pu.1 MO are standard and efficacy of knockdown was previously confirmed [63, 64]. To confirm the splice-blocking effect of the myd88 morpholino at this concentration, RNA was isolated from individual larvae with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III RT and oligo-dT (Invitrogen). PCR was then performed with GoTaq (Promega) and primers for myd88 (F: 5’-atggcatcaaagttaagtatagacc-3’, R: 5’-agggcagtgagagtgctttg-3’) and ef1a (F: 5’-tgccttcgtcccaatttcag-3’, R: 5’-taccctccttgcgctcaatc-3’)[66]. Shifts in band size were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. For irf8 and myd88 MO injections, a standard control MO (GeneTools) was used at a matching concentration. Clodronate liposome injection At 1.5 dpf, 2 nl of clodronate or PBS liposomes (Liposoma) with 0.1% phenol red was micro-injected intravenously into the caudal vein plexus of transgenic larvae expressing a fluorescent macrophage marker. Macrophage depletion was confirmed 24 hours later by loss of signal on a fluorescent zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective) prior to hindbrain injection of A. fumigatus. Aspergillus fumigatus growth and spore microinjection All A. fumigatus strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. TBK4.1 was generated by transforming TFYL44.1 with pJMP4, encoding the A. fumigatus argB gene [72]. TBK5.1 was generated from TBK4.1 by fusing mCherry to the 3’ end of A. fumigatus gpdA and inserting the A. fumigatus pyrG gene, as described previously for YFP expression in TBK1.1 [21]. Spores were grown at 37°C on solid glucose minimal media (GMM) and prepared for injection as described previously [21]. For pyrG1 auxotrophs, 5.2 mM uridine and 5 mM uracil were added to GMM as supplements. Micro-injection of spore preparations into the hindbrain of 2 dpf larvae was performed as previously described [21]. We aimed for an infectious dose of ~30 spores per larvae. Actual spore injection doses were monitored by single larvae CFU platings on day 0 of infection as described below and are reported in figure legends for each experiment. Spores were heat-killed by incubation at 99°C for 30 min, with 300 rpm shaking. For survival and CFU experiments, individual larvae were maintained in 96-well plates. For imaging analyses, larvae were kept in 35 mm dishes or in 48-well plates. Table 2. Aspergillus fumigatus strains used in this study.

The entire volume was plated on a 10 cm GMM plate, incubated for two days at 37°C, and CFUs were counted. For each CFU experiment, ≥8 larvae were individually plated for each time point and each condition. For co-infection CFU experiments, fluorescence of colonies was visualized on a zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective) to specifically count colonies of each strain. All CFU data were normalized to the average initial injection dose for each replicate and condition. Live-dead spore labeling Spore cell walls were labeled with AlexaFluor molecules as previously described [10]. Briefly, biotin-XX, SSE (Life Technologies) was conjugated to spores in 0.05 M NaHCO3. Spores were washed in Tris-HCl pH 8 to deactivate free-floating biotin, then washed in PBS, and incubated with streptavidin-AF594 or -AF633 (Life Technologies). Labeling was confirmed by fluorescence imaging and spores were resuspended in PBS and injected as described above. Live imaging To prevent pigment formation, 0.2 mM N-phenylthiourea (PTU, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to E3 water 1 dpf. Larvae carrying fluorescent transgenes were pre-screened on a zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective) prior to the experiment. For daily imaging, larvae were maintained in single wells of a 48-well plate. Each day, larvae were removed, one at a time, anesthetized in E3 with Tricaine, and placed into zWEDGI chambers [73] to correctly orient their hindbrains towards the bottom of the dish. Images were acquired on a spinning disk confocal microscope (CSU-X; Yokogawa) with a confocal scanhead on a Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope, Plan-Apochromat NA 0.8/20x objective, and a Photometrics Evolve EMCCD camera. Images were acquired with ZEN software (Zeiss). After imaging was complete, larvae were washed in E3 with PTU and placed back into the same plate well. To image AlexaFluor-labeled spores, larvae were also imaged in zWEDGI chambers [73] on the same spinning disk confocal microscope with an EC Plan-Neofluar NA 0.75/40x objective. Clodronate-injected larvae were also imaged with the spinning disk confocal with a EC Plan-Neofluar NA 0.3/10x objective. To image GFP expression in the NF-κB RE:GFP line, 2 days post injection (dpi) larvae were mounted in a glass-bottom dish with 1% low-melting point agarose. Images were acquired with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (FluoView FV1000; Olympus) with an NA 0.75/20x objective and FV10-ASW software (Olympus). To image mfap4:tomato-caax larvae, larvae at 3 dpi (for macrophage cluster imaging) or 1 dpi (for co-infection imaging) were mounted in agarose and imaged on the Olympus laser-scanning confocal microscope as described above. Image analysis/processing In all displayed images, image histogram levels were adjusted in Fiji. For any experiments where fluorescence intensity of images was quantified, no alteration was made to images prior to analysis. To quantify killing of AlexaFluor-labeled spores (Fig 1B and 1C), alive and killed spores were manually counted in Fiji. Displayed images of Alexa-Fluor labeled spores were also processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold. To quantify GFP signal from the NF-κB RE:GFP zebrafish line (Fig 2A and 2B), a single slice from each z-stack representing the center of the hindbrain was isolated. In Fiji, the hindbrain region was manually identified in the corresponding brightfield image and the mean grey value as well as the integrated density (area × mean grey value) in that region in the GFP channel was measured. Displayed images of GFP signal were also processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold. Signal intensity is displayed with the 16 colors look up table. To quantify phagocyte recruitment and fungal growth (Figs 4, 7 and 8), z-stacks and/or maximum intensity projections were analyzed in Fiji. Cell numbers, phagocyte cluster area, and presence of germination and/or invasive hyphae were scored manually. 2D fungal area was calculated by thresholding. Images of phagocyte recruitment (Fig 4C) were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 0.75). Images in S1 Movie were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 1). The displayed image of tomato+ clustered cells (Fig 4E) was processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density four-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 2). For co-infection imaging quantification (Fig 3), pair-wise distances between spores in each larvae were measured manually in Fiji. Displayed images of co-infection were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 1). Whole larvae images of macrophages and neutrophils after clodronate injection (S6A Fig) were manually assembled. Images of A. fumigatus infected clodronate-depleted or control larvae (S7A Fig) were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 0.75). Drug treatments Dexamethasone (Sigma) was resuspended to a stock concentration of 10 mM in 100% ethanol. Larvae were treated with 10 μM dexamethasone, or equivalent ethanol control (0.1%) immediately after infection and the drug was left on larvae for the entirety of the experiment. Withaferin A was resuspended in DMSO to a stock concentration of 10 mM. 2 hpi, E3 was changed to E3 with 30 μM withaferin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or DMSO (0.3%). 24 hpi, drug was removed and larvae were placed back in E3 alone. Sudan black staining Sudan black staining was performed as described in protocol dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.rced2te. For visualization of sudan black staining (and YFP/GFP of injected fungus), larvae were placed into zWEDGI wells [73] to correctly orient their hindbrains and imaged on a spinning disk confocal microscope (CSU-X; Yokogawa) with a confocal scanhead on a Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope, Plan-Apochromat NA 0.8/20x objective, a Photometrics Evolve EMCCD camera, and ZEN software (Zeiss). Calcofluor white staining Larvae were anesthetized and placed on a glass slide. As much liquid as possible was removed, 5 μl of 1 g/L calcofluor white was pipetted on top of the larvae, and a glass coverslip was placed on top. Smashed larvae were imaged for the presence of calcofluor-white stained hyphae within 10 minutes on a Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope with a EC Plan-Neofluar NA 0.30/10x objective and epifluorescence images were taken with a Photometrics Coolsnap ES2 camera and ZEN software (Zeiss). Statistical analyses For all statistical analyses, three independent experiments were performed. Experimental Ns are noted in figures and/or figure legends. For larval survival data and analysis of cumulative germination and invasive hyphal occurrence in larvae, replicates were pooled and analysed by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, with experimental replicate included as a group variable. In addition to pair-wise P values, this analysis also calculates hazard ratios, which are sometimes displayed. The hazard ratio can be interpreted as the relative death rate and represents the relative instantaneous risk of death throughout the experiment between two conditions. For quantification of imaging experiments (spore killing, intensity, cell counts, cluster area, or fungal area) and for CFU quantification, pooled data from three replicates was compared between experimental conditions using analysis of variance. Results are summarized in terms of least-squared adjusted means (lsmeans) and standard error (SEM). In some cases, graphs show both calculated lsmeans ± SEM and individual data points, color-coded by replicate. For data in Fig 7B and 7D, representing percent of larvae per experiment over three experiments, P values were calculated by t test and regular means ± SEM are displayed. Statistical analyses and graphical representations were done in R version 3.4, GraphPad Prism version 6, and/or Microsoft Excel 2016.",
    "results": "Results A CEA10-derived strain of Aspergillus fumigatus is killed better than an Af293-derived strain in vivo Differences in the virulence of two common lab strains isolated from patients, Af293 and CEA10, have been reported, but the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood [26–28]. In particular, the ability of wild-type hosts to contend with and clear these two different infections is not known. To investigate such clearance, we decided to apply a published method to visually quantify Aspergillus spore killing [10], to our established model of Aspergillus infection in transparent zebrafish larvae [21], giving us the ability to visualize fungal killing in a live, intact host. This live-dead staining method utilizes Aspergillus strains expressing a fluorescent protein (in these experiments, YFP or GFP) and coated in an AlexaFluor molecule of a different color (here, AlexaFluor594). Live spores are visualized as YFP/GFP signal surrounded by AlexaFluor signal, while killed spores appear as AlexaFluor signal only. We used strains derived from Af293 and CEA10 that express YFP and GFP, tagged to cytosolic proteins. Throughout this paper we will refer to Af293-derived and CEA10-derived strains in the text and figures as simply Af293 and CEA10, respectively, for ease of discussion, but we list actual strains used for each experiment in figure legends and the details of all strains in Methods. We injected dual-labeled spores into the hindbrain of wild-type 2 day post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae and imaged this hindbrain region; all images presented throughout this study are oriented as indicated (Fig 1A). Confocal imaging of these larvae 2 days post injection (dpi) revealed that CEA10 is killed significantly better than Af293, with a higher percentage of dual-labeled AlexaFluor594+, YFP/GFP+ spores in an Af293 infection compared to a CEA10 infection (Fig 1B and 1C). These results were surprising to us given that CEA10 has been reported to be more virulent than Af293 in some immunosuppressed mouse models of infection [26, 27] as well as in data from our lab in neutrophil-defective zebrafish larvae [28]. To confirm this difference in fungal killing, we quantified colony-forming units (CFUs) from homogenized single larvae over the course of a 5 day infection. This experiment recapitulated the finding that fungal burden of this CEA10 strain is controlled significantly better by larval zebrafish than the Af293 strain (Fig 1D). While Af293 persists in larvae throughout the course of infection, CEA10 is slowly cleared, so that by 2 dpi, the fungal burden in CEA10-infected larvae is significantly lower than that of Af293-infected larvae. Additionally, by 3 dpi, CEA10 fungal burden is significantly less than the initial dose. Af293 is never significantly cleared compared to the initial burden under the experimental conditions. We also confirmed that this trend holds for multiple Af293- and CEA10-derived strains, as well as the parental strains (S1 Fig). Fig 1.

TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) spores express YFP or GFP and have AlexaFluor594 conjugated to the spore cell wall. 2 dpi larvae were imaged and the percentage of spores killed (GFP+/total) was quantified.

Fungal burden was monitored by CFU platings from single homogenized larvae infected with TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10). CFUs from 24 larvae (3 replicates, 8 larvae each) per condition per day were measured. Average injection CFUs: Af293 = 150, CEA10 = 140. For all analyses, data represent lsmeans ± SEM from three pooled experiments, P values calculated by ANOVA. Asterisks represent significance between strains, # represent significance compared to day 0. See also S1 Fig. Myd88-mediated inflammatory activation is required for clearance of a CEA10-derived strain Compared to Af293, CEA10 differentially activates specific inflammatory pathways in mice [27], and we first hypothesized that the differential killing of CEA10 was due to greater inflammatory activation. We utilized an NF-κB RE:EGFP reporter line [33] to measure differences in NF-κB activation after infection with Af293- or CEA10-derived non-fluorescent strains in larval zebrafish. At 2 dpi, CEA10-infected larvae have significantly more GFP signal and therefore NF-κB activation than Af293-infected larvae at the infection site, indicating that NF-κB activation is correlated with fungal killing (Fig 2A and 2B). Fig 2. Inflammatory activation is required for clearance of a CEA10-derived strain. Open in a new tab A, B. NF-κB RE:EGFP larvae were infected with non-fluorescent TJW55.2 (Af293) or CEA17 KU80Δ (CEA10) spores and imaged 2 dpi. Representative images (A) and quantification from three pooled experiments (B) are shown. Scale bar represents 50 μm. CEA10 n = 22; Af293 n = 26. C. Larvae were treated with dexamethasone (DEX) or ethanol (EtOH) vehicle control directly after infection with TFYL81.5 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10), and larval survival was monitored. Average injection CFUs: Af293 = 34, CEA10 = 33. D-F. myd88-/- or control larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) and larval survival and/or fungal burden was monitored. Fungal burden was determined by CFU platings from single homogenized larvae. Asterisks represent significance between myd88-/- and control larvae, # represent significance compared to day 0.

See also S2 Fig.To determine whether general immune activation is required for fungal killing, we treated larvae with the corticosteroid dexamethasone immediately after spore injection. Neither Af293 nor CEA10 caused much death in control larvae, consistent with previous results in our zebrafish model and the idea that wild-type hosts can largely control Aspergillus infection [21]. Treatment with dexamethasone, however, caused both Af293- and CEA10-infected larvae to succumb rapidly and equally to infection (Fig 2C), consistent with the identical virulence of these two strains observed in a chemotherapeutic mouse model [26]. Control PBS-injected larvae treated with dexamethasone had minimal death (S2A Fig). Similar results were obtained after treatment with withaferin A, a non-specific inhibitor of NF-κB (S2B Fig). These results suggest that while CEA10 infection induces significantly more activation of NF-κB, under general immunosuppressive conditions, neither of these strains can be controlled by the host. Both dexamethasone and withaferin A have broad effects, therefore we next investigated the role of specific pathways upstream of NF-κB in fungal killing. Myd88 is an adaptor molecule downstream of TLR/IL-1R signaling that has previously been implicated in the response to Aspergillus [34, 35]. myd88-/- larvae are more susceptible to CEA10, but not Af293, infection compared to wild-type controls (Fig 2D), consistent with the idea that Myd88-mediated immune activation is required specifically for the response to CEA10. This increase in susceptibility to a CEA10 strain of myd88-/- larvae coincided with a significantly decreased ability to clear CEA10 fungal burden, while loss of Myd88 had no effect on Af293 fungal burden (Fig 2E and 2F). Knockdown of myd88 did not inhibit activation of the NF-κB RE:EGFP reporter line by a CEA10-derived strain (S2C and S2D Fig). This is could be due to 1) other pathways that also activate NF-κB and/or 2) increased fungal growth in these larvae resulting in more inflammation. Together, these results show that CEA10 induces a more robust inflammatory response than Af293 and Myd88-dependent signaling is required for clearance of CEA10 fungal burden. CEA10-induced inflammatory activation is not sufficient for killing of Af293 To specifically test whether the increased immune activation induced by this CEA10 infection is sufficient for fungal killing, we co-infected larvae with a red fluorescent Af293-derived strain and a green fluorescent CEA10-derived strain and performed CFU counts throughout a 5 day infection. As shown previously, in single infections this CEA10 strain is cleared over the course of infection while the Af293 strain persists (Figs 1D and 3A). In a co-infection, this same pattern remained—Af293 was not significantly cleared, even in the presence of an immune-activating CEA10 strain (Fig 3A). Imaging experiments confirmed that these spores can be found in the same or neighboring cells (Figs 3B, 3C and S3), suggesting that these killing differences are not due to local variation in immune activation, but instead to fungal-intrinsic phenotypes. Fig 3. CEA10-induced inflammatory activation is not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain. Open in a new tab A. Fungal burden was monitored by CFU platings from single homogenized larvae infected either singly with TFYL49.1 (CEA10) or TBK5.1 (Af293) or co-infected with both strains. Average injection CFUs: Af293 = 53, CEA10 = 47, co-infection = 21 Af293 + 27 CEA10. CFUs from 24 larvae (8 larvae per replicate) per condition per day were measured; lsmeans ± SEM are shown from three pooled experiments, P values calculated by ANOVA. B, C. Macrophage-membrane labeled larvae (mfap4:tomato-CAAX) were co-infected with YFP-expressing TBK1.1 (Af293) and AlexaFluor633-labeled CEA17 KU80Δ (CEA10) and imaged 1 dpi. Percentage of Af293 spores within 20 μm of a CEA10 spore in each larvae from two replicates was quantified (B). Each point represents one larvae, color-coded by replicate. Single z-slice images from a representative larvae (C) are shown. Scale bar represents 5 μm. See also S3 Fig. Macrophages form tight, persistent, and dynamic clusters around A. fumigatus To further determine the mechanism by which this CEA10 strain of A. fumigatus is killed, we utilized the multi-day imaging capabilities of larval zebrafish to monitor the recruitment and behavior of macrophages and neutrophils in individual larvae over the course of a five day infection. By following individual larvae with both labeled macrophage nuclei (mpeg1:mcherry-H2B) and neutrophils (lyz:BFP) throughout a 5 day infection, we aimed to determine both differences in immune cell recruitment within larvae over time and population-level differences between larvae infected with a CEA10-derived strain versus an Af293-derived strain. On a population level, CEA10 infection recruited more macrophages and neutrophils than Af293 infection, throughout the entire time course (Fig 4A and 4B). These differences were significant as early as 2 dpi and up to 5 dpi (Fig 4A and 4B). However, the number of macrophages and neutrophils present at the site of infection was also dynamic, fluctuating from day to day in individual larvae (Fig 4A and 4B). In general, immune cell recruitment peaked at 2 dpi, decreasing slowly afterwards, coinciding with the timeline of fungal clearance (Fig 1D). Fig 4. Macrophages form tight clusters around A. fumigatus. Open in a new tab A-D. Dual macrophage-nuclear (mpeg1:mcherry-H2B) and neutrophil (lyz:BFP) labeled larvae were infected with YFP- or GFP-expressing A. fumigatus TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) strains and imaged days 1–5 post injection. Macrophage (A) and neutrophil (B) recruitment as well as phagocyte cluster size (D) were quantified. Representative images (C, scale bar represents 20 μm) and pooled quantification from 3 experiments (A, B, D) are shown. Each line in graphs represents one larvae followed for the entire course of infection, lines are color-coded by replicate, bars represent pooled lsmeans ± SEM, P values calculated by ANOVA. Af293 n = 25, CEA10 n = 27 for macrophage and cluster area quantification; Af293 n = 17, CEA10 n = 18 for neutrophil quantification. E. Macrophage-membrane (mfap4:tomato-CAAX) labeled larvae were infected with CEA17 KU80Δ (CEA10) and imaged 3 dpi. Asterisks represent cell nuclei, arrows indicate cell-cell junctions. Scale bar represents 10 μm. See also S4 Fig.During this imaging, we were surprised to find that these recruited phagocytes form tight clusters around the injected A. fumigatus, as early as 1 dpi, that persist throughout the five day infection (Figs 4C, 4D and S4A, S1 Movie). These clusters were primarily made up of macrophages, but neutrophils also infiltrated, generally arriving after macrophages (Figs 4C and S4A). These macrophages form tight associations, with their membranes directly opposed and without space between the cells (Fig 4E). Germination of A. fumigatus spores inside the clusters could be found (S4A Fig). We also observed the apical extrusion of a cluster out of the hindbrain of two larvae, suggesting extrusion is a possible but rare mechanism for the host to eliminate the infection (S4B Fig). Quantification of phagocyte cluster size demonstrates that significantly larger clusters form in response to CEA10 compared to Af293, consistent with differences in observed numbers of phagocytes recruited (Fig 4C and 4D). Additionally, the size of these clusters is dynamic, changing in individual larvae throughout the course of infection, but also peaking at 2 dpi and decreasing in size as the infection is cleared (Fig 4C and 4D). A CEA10-derived strain is more virulent than an Af293-derived strain in a neutrophil-defective host Since macrophages are the predominant cell type infiltrating the site of infection and forming clusters around the fungus, we hypothesized that macrophages contribute to killing of CEA10-derived strains of A. fumigatus. Macrophages and neutrophils are the predominant immune cell types present in zebrafish larvae at this stage of development [36] and therefore, to determine the ability of macrophages alone to kill A. fumigatus in vivo, we performed fungal CFU counts after infection of a neutrophil-defective host (mpx:rac2D57N). These larvae express a dominant-negative copy of Rac2 under a neutrophil-specific promoter, preventing the migration of neutrophils out of the vasculature [37]. Consistent with previous observations (Fig 1), an Af293-derived strain was not significantly cleared in either neutrophil-defective or control hosts (Fig 5A). However, 2 dpi, neutrophil-defective larvae are able to decrease fungal burden of a CEA10-derived strain equivalently to the control, to ~60% of the initial dose (Fig 5A), indicating that early in infection macrophages have a low-level killing ability against CEA10. However, at 3 dpi, CFUs from these neutrophil-defective larvae increase, demonstrating that macrophages alone cannot contain the growth of CEA10 (Fig 5A). Because these larvae have fewer functional immune cells in total, we also tested a lower dose of CEA10, but found that the infectious dose did not have any effect on percent of fungal clearance (S5 Fig). Fig 5. A CEA10-derived strain is more virulent in a neutrophil-defective host. Open in a new tab Neutrophil-defective (mpx:rac2D57N) or control (mpx:rac2WT) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10). A. CFUs were monitored, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 36, CEA10 = 32. B. Larval survival was monitored, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 35, CEA10 = 27. For all analyses, data shown are from 3 pooled replicates. For CFU analysis, data represent lsmeans ± SEM, P values calculated by ANOVA. CFU data are from 24 larvae (3 replicates, 8 larvae each) per condition per day. For survival analysis, P values were calculated by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. See also S5 Fig.Over 80% of these neutrophil-defective larvae succumb to infection with CEA10 (Fig 5B). To compare the relative likelihood of neutrophil-defective larvae to succumb to CEA10 versus Af293 infection, we calculated hazard ratios, which represent the relative instantaneous risk of death throughout the experiment between two conditions. This calculation revealed that while neutrophil-defective larvae are significantly more susceptible to both Af293 and CEA10 infections than control larvae, these hosts are ~3 times more likely to succumb to CEA10 infection than Af293 infection (Fig 5B), consistent with our previous results in this zebrafish line [28]. So, while CEA10 is cleared significantly more than Af293 in wild-type larvae, it is also more virulent in a neutrophil-defective host. Altogether, these data suggest that macrophages do not account for the majority of fungal killing, instead implicating neutrophils. Macrophages provide a protective niche for CEA10 To specifically investigate the function of neutrophils in the response to these two A. fumigatus strains, we next infected macrophage-deficient larvae (irf8-/-). These zebrafish lack the transcription factor Irf8, and do not develop macrophages for the first 7 days after fertilization [38]. We again enumerated CFUs after infection with either an Af293-derived or a CEA10-derived strain. Remarkably, these macrophage-deficient larvae are able to clear CEA10 significantly more than control larvae (Fig 6A). While, again, wild-type hosts significantly decrease CEA10 fungal burden by 3 dpi, at 2 dpi almost 100% of injected CEA10 is cleared in macrophage-deficient hosts (Fig 6A). Consequently, when we monitored survival, CEA10-infected macrophage-deficient larvae succumbed to infection at an almost identical rate as wild-type controls (Fig 6B). Af293, on the other hand, was not significantly cleared in macrophage-deficient larvae (Fig 6A) and Af293 infection did result in significantly more death in macrophage-deficient larvae compared to controls (Fig 6B), consistent with previous results in zebrafish with this strain [21]. Fig 6. A CEA10-derived strain is cleared more efficiently by macrophage-deficient hosts than wild-type hosts. Open in a new tab A, B. Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) or control (irf8+/+) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) and CFUs (A) or larval survival (B) were monitored. For CFU experiments, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 23, CEA10 = 23. For survival experiments, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 44, CEA10 = 31. C, D. Macrophage-depleted (clodronate liposomes) or control (PBS liposomes) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) and CFUs (C) or larval survival (D) were monitored. Average injection CFUs: Af293 = 37, CEA10 = 40. For all analyses, data shown are from 3 pooled replicates. For CFU analyses, data represent lsmeans ± SEM, P values calculated by ANOVA. All CFU data are from 24 larvae (3 replicates, 8 larvae each) per condition per day. For survival analyses, P values were calculated by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. See also S6 Fig.As a consequence of Irf8 deficiency, these larvae also develop a larger number of neutrophils [38]. However, larvae injected with clodronate liposomes also cleared a CEA10-derived strain, but not an Af293-derived strain, significantly better than control PBS liposome-injected larvae at 1 dpi (Fig 6C). As clodronate liposome injection specifically depletes macrophages without affecting neutrophils (S6A Fig), this result suggests that this increased early clearance is a specific consequence of macrophage depletion. Clodronate liposome-injected larvae do however succumb to infection (Figs 6D and S6B), indicating either that a larger number of neutrophils is required for complete fungal clearance and host survival in the absence of macrophages, and/or that clodronate liposomes affect neutrophil function without altering neutrophil numbers. These data demonstrate that the presence of macrophages actually protects injected CEA10 spores, but not Af293 spores, from neutrophil-mediated killing at early time points after infection, and suggest that macrophages might provide a protective niche for survival of certain fungal strains. CEA10 recruits more neutrophils than Af293 in macrophage-deficient hosts To quantify neutrophil recruitment in the absence of macrophages, we performed sudan black staining 1 dpi in macrophage-deficient irf8-/- or control larvae (Fig 7A–7C). Strikingly, in ~50% of macrophage-deficient larvae infected with a CEA10-derived strain, we observed extensive neutrophil recruitment that resulted in a mass of sudan black staining (Fig 7A and 7B). These sudan black masses were also sometimes observed in macrophage-deficient larvae infected with an Af293-derived strain, but significantly less so, and were rarely observed in control infected larvae. We quantified the number of neutrophils recruited to the infection site, finding significantly more recruitment in irf8-/- larvae infected with an CEA10-derived strain compared to an Af293-derived strain (Fig 7C). These data indicate that in the absence of macrophages, high numbers of neutrophils are specifically recruited to CEA10 infections. Fig 7. More neutrophils are recruited to a CEA10-derived strain than an Af293-derived strain in the absence of macrophages. Open in a new tab A-D. Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) or control (irf8+/+) larvae were infected with YFP- or GFP-expressing A. fumigatus TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) strains, fixed 1 dpi, and stained for neutrophils (sudan black). Representative images are shown (A, scale bar represents 50 μm) and percent of larvae per experiment with sudan black masses (B), number of neutrophils at infection site (C), and percent of larvae per experiment with A. fumigatus hyphae (D) were quantified.

Wild-type or myd88-/- embryos were injected with control (std) or macrophage-depleting (irf8) morpholinos. Larvae were then infected with TFYL49.1 (CEA10) spores and CFUs were measured. Average injection CFUs = 38. CFU data represent lsmeans ± SEM of 3 pooled replicates, n = 24 larvae (3 replicates, 8 larvae each) per condition per day, P values calculated with ANOVA. See also S7 Fig. Macrophages inhibit A. fumigatus germination These results raise the question of what signals promote neutrophil recruitment to CEA10 in the absence of macrophages. Since neutrophils have been reported to respond specifically to hyphal forms of A. fumigatus [21], we hypothesized that macrophages inhibit spore germination. Indeed, the massive neutrophil recruitment we observed in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient larvae was often accompanied by fungal germination and hyphal growth (Fig 7A). In fact, the percentage of larvae with hyphae present was higher in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient hosts compared to wild-type hosts after infection with either an Af293-derived or a CEA10-derived strain (Fig 7D), suggesting that the presence of macrophages inhibits A. fumigatus germination. Similar results were seen in clodronate liposome-injected larvae (S7A Fig). Previous experiments also suggest this rate of germination may be an underestimate for CEA10 infection since this fungus is cleared so effectively in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient conditions (Fig 6A). These data suggest that in the absence of macrophages, fungal germination induces signals that recruit neutrophils. Myd88 is not required for neutrophil-mediated fungal killing Germination unmasks fungal cell wall components such as β-glucans that can be sensed by the host through TLR and CLR pathways [18]. Given our previous observation that the signaling molecule Myd88 is required for full clearance of a CEA10 strain (Fig 2F), we hypothesized that Myd88 is involved in neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection after spore germination. While Myd88 has been shown to be dispensable for neutrophil-intrinsic anti-fungal activity, it can be required in other cell types such as epithelial cells for neutrophil recruitment to A. fumigatus infections [34]. To determine if neutrophil-mediated killing of CEA10 in the absence of macrophages requires Myd88 signaling, we combined the myd88-/- mutant line with macrophage-deficiency (irf8 morpholino). We performed CFU counts at just 1 dpi since neutrophil-mediated clearance of CEA10 in the absence of macrophages occurs rapidly (Fig 6A). Consistent with previous results, at 1 dpi CEA10 is not cleared in wild-type hosts, while Irf8 deficiency alone led to significantly increased clearance (Figs 7E and S7B). However, we observed virtually identical clearance in macrophage-deficient hosts that also lacked Myd88 (Figs 7E and S7B). These data demonstrate that Myd88 is not required for neutrophil-mediated killing of germinated spores of a CEA10-derived strain, but instead that neutrophil activation signals are likely transduced through other pathways. A CEA10-derived strain germinates earlier than an Af293-derived strain in vivo Given our findings that neutrophils respond primarily to germinated A. fumigatus spores and that neutrophils are much better fungal killers than macrophages, we hypothesized that the increased killing of CEA10 compared to Af293 might be attributable to differences in germination and hyphal growth of these strains. CEA10 has been shown to germinate faster than Af293 in liquid culture in vitro [28] and more germinated spores of CEA10 compared to Af293 were found in the lungs of infected mice [27], but germination rates of these two strains have not been directly measured in vivo. To measure fungal growth in vivo, we infected both wild-type and phagocyte-deficient (pu.1 morphant) larvae with YFP- or GFP-expressing spores of strains derived from either CEA10 or Af293. Phagocyte-deficient larvae succumb quickly to infection with either strain, but on average CEA10 infection results in death one day earlier than Af293 infection (Fig 8A), suggesting CEA10 grows faster in vivo. Similar results were obtained with several CEA10- and Af293-derived strains (S8 Fig). To directly monitor fungal development and growth over time, we imaged these larvae every day for five days of infection (or until larvae succumbed). After only 1 day of infection, we observed pervasive growth of CEA10 in phagocyte-deficient hosts (Fig 8B). While both Af293 and CEA10 spores had germinated after 1 day, CEA10 had already developed invasive hyphae throughout the hindbrain. We quantified how long it took individual larvae to exhibit both germinated spores (Fig 8C) and invasive hyphae (Fig 8D). These data confirmed that CEA10 both germinates significantly faster and grows into invasive hyphae significantly faster than Af293 in both wild-type and phagocyte-deficient hosts (Fig 8C and 8D). Quantification of fungal burden by measuring GFP+ area from these images also reflected greater growth of CEA10 and a ~1 day delay in Af293 growth (Fig 8E). Fig 8. A CEA10-derived strain germinates faster than an Af293-derived strain in vivo.

See also S8 Fig. Germination drives neutrophil-mediated fungal killing To investigate the role of germination in neutrophil recruitment, we injected heat-killed spores into macrophage-deficient irf8-/- larvae and quantified the presence of sudan black masses in the hindbrain that we observed previously (Fig 7A and 7B). We found that heat-killed spores do not recruit neutrophils, suggesting that spore germination and fungal growth is required for neutrophil recruitment (Fig 9A). Fig 9. Neutrophil-mediated killing requires germination. Open in a new tab A. Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) or control (irf8+/+) larvae were injected with live or heat-killed TFYL49.1 (CEA10), fixed 1 dpi, and stained for neutrophils (sudan black).

Wild-type or phagocyte-deficient (pu.1 morphant) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293 pyrG+), Af293.1 (Af293 pyrG-), TFYL49.1 (CEA10 pyrG+), or CEA17 (CEA10 pyrG-) spores and survival was monitored.

Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) larvae were infected with CEA17 KU80Δ (CEA10 pyrG+), or CEA17 (CEA10 pyrG-) and CFUs were monitored. Average injection CFUs: CEA10 pyrG+ = 41, CEA10 pyrG- = 45. All CFU data represent lsmeans ± SEM from 3 pooled replicates composed of 24 larvae (8 larvae per replicate) per condition per day. P values were calculated by ANOVA. See also S9 Fig.However, immune cell killing activity against heat-killed spores cannot be measured, therefore to investigate the role of germination in fungal clearance, we utilized A. fumigatus pyrG-deficient strains, which are auxotrophic for uridine-uracil and are known to have impaired germination and attenuated virulence in mice [39]. To determine if these strains also have impaired germination in larval zebrafish we infected phagocyte-deficient larvae (pu.1 morphant) and measured survival as well as germination. Indeed, germination of a CEA10-derived pyrG-deficient strain is abrogated in larval zebrafish and both CEA10- and Af293-derived pyrG-deficient strains cause minimal death in both wild-type and phagocyte-deficient larvae (Figs 9B and S9). We infected wild-type larvae with Af293 and CEA10 pyrG- and pyrG+ reconstituted strains and performed CFU counts to determine the requirement for germination in fungal killing in the presence of both macrophages and neutrophils. Again, Af293 was not cleared significantly and the pyrG mutation did not have a significant effect on fungal burden in this strain background (Fig 9C). In a CEA10 infection, both a pyrG+ strain and pyrG- strain had significant levels of killing by 3 dpi and CFU counts from larvae infected with these strains were virtually identical 5 dpi (Fig 9C). These data suggest that in wild-type larvae germination is not required for fungal clearance, although we cannot rule out the possibility that pyrG-deficient spores do eventually germinate at later time points in infection. To determine the requirement for germination in neutrophil-mediated killing, we determined the effect of pyrG deficiency in the specific context of CEA10 killing in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient hosts (Fig 6A). In these larvae, neutrophils effectively clear ~85% of CEA10 pyrG+ fungal burden by 1 dpi (Fig 9D). However, a CEA10 pyrG- infection is cleared significantly less in this context. At 3 dpi, there is no difference in pyrG- fungal clearance between irf8-/- macrophage-deficient larvae and wild-type larvae. These data indicate that pyrG-deficient CEA10 cannot be cleared by neutrophils, even in the absence of macrophages, suggesting that neutrophil-mediated clearance of CEA10 is dependent on germination. Together, these data demonstrate that germination drives neutrophil-mediated killing of A. fumigatus, and explain why a faster germinating strain is actually cleared more effectively by innate immune cells than a slower-growing strain (Fig 10). Fig 10. Model of neutrophil and macrophage responses to Aspergillus fumigatus. Open in a new tab Upon infection, A. fumigatus spores are taken up by macrophages, which form dense clusters around the fungus and inhibit spore germination. Macrophages provide a protective niche for spore survival, as neutrophil-mediated killing of A. fumigatus requires germination. As a result, in infections with slow-germinating A. fumigatus strains, the fungus persists for days, while in infections with fast-germinating A. fumigatus strains, germination drives neutrophil recruitment, neutrophil-mediated killing, and faster fungal clearance. Macrophages have some anti-fungal activity, dependent on Myd88-NF-κB signaling, however NF-κB activation is not sufficient to kill slow-germinating strains.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Here we have used larval zebrafish to image Aspergillus fumigatus infection in live, intact hosts, over the course of a multi-day infection to visualize and quantify both immune cell behavior and fungal development and growth. Using a method to visually quantify spore killing, we find that faster-growing CEA10-derived strains of A. fumigatus are cleared significantly better than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. We report that clearance of CEA10-derived strains is primarily due to neutrophil function and is driven by fungal germination, whereas slower-growing Af293-derived strains do not recruit as many neutrophils and therefore can persist in the host for >5 days. Many fungal pathogens can survive within macrophages [40], but the role of macrophages in vivo in A. fumigatus pathogenesis has remained ambiguous, and we find that macrophages form tight clusters around injected spores. Macrophages inhibit spore germination, and without spore germination, neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing are diminished, thus macrophages act as a protective niche against neutrophil-mediated killing (Fig 10). The phagocyte clusters that we observe are reminiscent of aspergillomas or “fungal granulomas” that are found in lung or intracranial lesions of human patients [41, 42]. These macrophage-driven phagocyte clusters have never been observed before in an animal model of Aspergillus infection, but phagocyte clustering is a common phenomenon in infections, with the mycobacteria granuloma as the classic example [43]. We do find some neutrophils infiltrating into these clusters and neutrophil aggregates have been reported in response to both to Aspergillus [12] and Candida [44]. Zebrafish larvae have been an ideal model in which to detect phagocyte clusters, and they have been found in response to not just mycobacteria [45], but also Streptococcus iniaie [46] and Mucor circinelloides [47]. In tuberculosis, granulomas can provide bacterial-protective functions [48] and macrophages can also act as protective niches for other pathogens [49]. In vivo, in larval zebrafish, macrophages do not have much spore killing ability, in contrast to what has been found in vitro [4, 5], but in line with some in vivo mouse experiments [6]. While in other mouse experiments macrophage depletion led to an increase in A. fumigatus fungal burden [7], we hypothesize that the protective niche function of macrophages is only relevant at lower doses of spores, not at the dose given in these experiments (~107). Our data suggest that the protective niche function of macrophages arises simply by inhibition of fungal germination (Fig 10). While it is also possible that macrophages actively repel neutrophils, as we have observed this behavior in other inflammatory contexts [50], we cannot conclude this from the data presented here. Neutrophils are highly efficient killers of A. fumigatus, and we find that this killing is largely dependent on germination. Whether neutrophils respond directly to signals exposed on hyphae or if epithelial cells and/or macrophages sense hyphae and recruit neutrophils in this context is not known. In mice, the neutrophil response to CEA10 is dependent on IL-1α production [27]. IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling requires the Myd88 adaptor protein, but our experiments with myd88-/- larvae demonstrate that Myd88 is not required for neutrophil recruitment and killing in this context. The Card9 adaptor can also transduce fungal signals to recruit neutrophils [34], and we hypothesize that this signaling is occurring in macrophage-deficient larvae to recruit neutrophils. Interestingly, in mice, neutrophil recruitment to Af293 and CEA10 infections is driven by different pathways and signals, in agreement with the differences we observe in the ability of these strains to recruit neutrophils [27]. In addition to inducing neutrophil recruitment, germination likely also makes A. fumigatus more susceptible to host killing mechanisms in vivo. In fact, we find that a slower-germinating Af293-derived strain is not effectively killed by the host even in a co-infection with a faster-germinating CEA10-derived strain. Hyphal growth and branching increases susceptibility to neutrophil-mediated killing in vitro [51], and it has long been thought that neutrophils are much more effective killers against hyphae than conidia [52]. One immune mechanism that neutrophils use against hyphae is neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are observed in infected mouse lung tissue containing hyphae [20, 53]. In the absence of macrophages and the increased presence of hyphae we observed large masses of sudan black staining at the site of infection that are reminiscent of NETs. Sudan black stains neutrophil granules, and therefore these masses could be actual NETs, neutrophil degranulation, or simply massive neutrophil recruitment. It is worth noting that in imaging neutrophils expressing a cytosolic fluorescent protein recruited to the site of infection we could sometimes see a haziness in that channel suggesting neutrophil lysis, but could not prove the origin of this signal. Differences in virulence between Af293 and CEA10 are also observed in murine models of Aspergillus infection. In a chemotherapeutic model of immunosuppression, infection with either of these strains caused similar rates of host death [26], a situation that may be similar to our dexamethasone-treated zebrafish larvae (Fig 2C). In a less immunosuppressed triamcinolone-treated mouse model, CEA10 is more virulent [26]. However, this increase in virulence is thought to be a result of increased resistance to hypoxia, a hallmark of this model [26], while we do not know the hypoxic state of our zebrafish immunosuppression models. Murine studies have correlated the increased growth and germination of CEA10 compared to Af293 with increased tissue damage [27], but have also found that increased growth in vitro across multiple environmental and clinical isolates correlates with increased host survival in the triamcinolone-treated mouse model [26], possibly consistent with our findings that increased growth leads to increased host response and clearance mechanisms. Between these strains of A. fumigatus, we have identified two different virulence mechanisms, both of which are commonly observed in a variety of human pathogens. CEA10-derived strains can germinate quickly in vivo, and therefore under neutrophil-deficient conditions can cause disease and spread. On the other hand, Af293-derived strains do not germinate quickly but instead can persist largely undetected in the host. This latter mechanism is similar to one proposed for a different Aspergillus species, A. terreus [54], and for the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans [55]. These two different mechanisms highlight the contradiction underlying Aspergillus pathogenesis: while germination is required for virulence, it simultaneously activates the immune system and immune mechanisms that can kill the fungus. These ideas are relevant for the development and deployment of anti-Aspergillus treatments. Are there particular host scenarios in which it is better to simply inhibit germination and allow Aspergillus spores to persist? Or others where it is better to induce germination to activate host immune responses? Drugs that target macrophages to both maintain their ability to inhibit germination and increase neutrophil recruitment could provide the best possible scenario for future immunotherapies. Future investigation of the mechanisms behind each of these macrophage behaviors will be required to further understand the molecules and pathways involved.",

Copyright notice ID: 6091969 PMID: 30071103 Abstract In immunocompromised individuals, Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive fungal disease that is often difficult to treat. Exactly how immune mechanisms control A. fumigatus in immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to different A. fumigatus strains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10 pyrG-deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection. Altogether, we describe a new role for macrophages in the persistence of A. fumigatus and highlight the ability of different A. fumigatus strains to adopt diverse modes of virulence.Author summary Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to invasive fungal infections, including aspergillosis. However, healthy humans inhale spores of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus from the environment every day without becoming sick, and how the immune system clears this infection is still obscure. Additionally, there are many different strains of A. fumigatus, and whether the pathogenesis of these different strains varies is also largely unknown. To investigate these questions, we infected larval zebrafish with A. fumigatus spores derived from two genetically diverse strains. Larval zebrafish allow for visualization of fungal growth and innate immune cell behavior in live, intact animals. We find that differences in the rate of growth between strains directly affect fungal persistence. In both wild-type and macrophage-deficient zebrafish larvae, a fast-germinating strain is actually cleared better than a slow-germinating strain. This fungal killing is driven primarily by neutrophils while macrophages promote fungal persistence by inhibiting spore germination. Our experiments underline different mechanisms of virulence that pathogens can utilize—rapid growth versus dormancy and persistence—and inform future strategies for fighting fungal infections in susceptible immunocompromised patients.Introduction Humans inhale hundreds of Aspergillus fumigatus spores from the environment every day and yet almost all immunocompetent individuals successfully contend with the fungal infection. Immunocompromised patients, however, especially acute leukemia patients, hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, and solid-organ transplant recipients, are at risk of developing invasive aspergillosis [1]. In invasive disease, Aspergillus spores germinate into filamentous hyphae and invade and destroy tissues and organs, with mortality rates as high as 50 to 60% in patient populations [1]. Limited antifungal treatments exist and there is growing resistance among fungi to these drugs [2]. The development of successful immunotherapy-based treatments to this infection requires a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay of immune mechanisms that control Aspergillus in vivo. In immunocompetent individuals, the innate immune system is generally sufficient for A. fumigatus clearance, with both macrophages and neutrophils playing major roles [3]. Macrophages primarily target and phagocytose conidia (spores), and can kill conidia in vitro within hours [4, 5]. In vivo, however, the requirement for and role of macrophages is unclear, with some studies reporting no effect on survival in macrophage-depleted mice [6] and others demonstrating an increased fungal burden in such mice [7]. Neutrophils, on the other hand, are consistently required in mice in response to Aspergillus [6, 8], and neutropenia is a key risk factor for patients in the development of invasive aspergillosis [9]. Neutrophils can kill conidia in vivo [10] and inhibit conidial germination both in vitro and in vivo [11, 12]. Immune cell populations can also influence the activity of other immune cell types, and CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes can increase neutrophil function in response to Aspergillus through pro-inflammatory gene expression [13, 14]. However, the full extent of macrophage/monocyte and neutrophil interactions throughout the course of infection, and their effect on fungal growth and clearance, are not known. Perhaps the most important step in Aspergillus pathogenesis is germination, the developmental switch from resting, dormant conidia to filamentous, invasive growth [15]. These different fungal forms induce differential activation of immune cells in vitro and recruitment of these cells in vivo [16–18]. After invasive hyphae have developed, neutrophils can respond with a variety of killing mechanisms [11, 19–21]. However, how this switch, and specifically earlier stages of fungal germination prior to the development of extensive invasive growth, affects immune activation, fungal clearance, and disease progression in vivo is largely unknown. Larval zebrafish provide an ideal model in which to study the early effects of fungal germination as well as the interplay between multiple immune cell types throughout infection. Larval zebrafish are transparent and can be non-invasively imaged and therefore allow for visualization of innate immune cell behavior and fungal development in a live, intact host throughout a multi-day infection. While murine models require enormous fungal inoculums (~107 conidia) and host immunosuppression in order to directly visualize immune cell-pathogen encounters within the context of host tissue, the larval zebrafish allows for visualization of smaller doses (10–100 conidia) in wild-type hosts [22]. Aspergillus infection models in zebrafish have already been developed by our lab and others and recapitulate many aspects of human and mouse infection, including initial phagocytosis of conidia by macrophages and post-germination neutrophil recruitment [21, 23]. These models have already provided new insight into the biology of immune responses to Aspergillus such as the observation of spore transfer between macrophages [24]. In this study, we have infected larval zebrafish with Aspergillus fumigatus strains derived from patient isolates Af293 and CEA10. Heterogeneity among A. fumigatus isolates has been increasingly recognized [25], and Af293 and CEA10 in particular are known to be differentially virulent in specific mouse and zebrafish models [26–28]. The genomes of these strains differ by ~50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which is an approximately average level of genetic diversity among sequenced A. fumigatus isolates [28]. Af293 and CEA10 strains also possess differences in growth [27], activation of the host immune response [27, 29], response to hypoxia [26], secondary metabolism [30, 31], and response to light [32]. We aimed to use these two different strains coupled with live imaging in larval zebrafish to identify and characterize differential neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to A. fumigatus infection. We report that while CEA10 is generally regarded as more virulent than Af293 [26, 27], CEA10-derived strains are killed better than Af293-derived strains in vivo, even while CEA10-derived strains germinate faster. Host inflammatory activation, partially through Myd88, is required for clearance of a CEA10-derived strain, but strikingly, is not sufficient for clearance of an Af293-derived strain. Macrophages only marginally contribute to clearance of CEA10-derived strains. Instead, macrophages primarily provide a protective niche for spores, forming tight, dense clusters around the fungus, inhibiting spore germination. Our data demonstrate that germination actually drives fungal clearance through neutrophil-mediated killing.Results A CEA10-derived strain of Aspergillus fumigatus is killed better than an Af293-derived strain in vivo Differences in the virulence of two common lab strains isolated from patients, Af293 and CEA10, have been reported, but the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood [26–28]. In particular, the ability of wild-type hosts to contend with and clear these two different infections is not known. To investigate such clearance, we decided to apply a published method to visually quantify Aspergillus spore killing [10], to our established model of Aspergillus infection in transparent zebrafish larvae [21], giving us the ability to visualize fungal killing in a live, intact host. This live-dead staining method utilizes Aspergillus strains expressing a fluorescent protein (in these experiments, YFP or GFP) and coated in an AlexaFluor molecule of a different color (here, AlexaFluor594). Live spores are visualized as YFP/GFP signal surrounded by AlexaFluor signal, while killed spores appear as AlexaFluor signal only. We used strains derived from Af293 and CEA10 that express YFP and GFP, tagged to cytosolic proteins. Throughout this paper we will refer to Af293-derived and CEA10-derived strains in the text and figures as simply Af293 and CEA10, respectively, for ease of discussion, but we list actual strains used for each experiment in figure legends and the details of all strains in Methods. We injected dual-labeled spores into the hindbrain of wild-type 2 day post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae and imaged this hindbrain region; all images presented throughout this study are oriented as indicated (Fig 1A). Confocal imaging of these larvae 2 days post injection (dpi) revealed that CEA10 is killed significantly better than Af293, with a higher percentage of dual-labeled AlexaFluor594+, YFP/GFP+ spores in an Af293 infection compared to a CEA10 infection (Fig 1B and 1C). These results were surprising to us given that CEA10 has been reported to be more virulent than Af293 in some immunosuppressed mouse models of infection [26, 27] as well as in data from our lab in neutrophil-defective zebrafish larvae [28]. To confirm this difference in fungal killing, we quantified colony-forming units (CFUs) from homogenized single larvae over the course of a 5 day infection. This experiment recapitulated the finding that fungal burden of this CEA10 strain is controlled significantly better by larval zebrafish than the Af293 strain (Fig 1D). While Af293 persists in larvae throughout the course of infection, CEA10 is slowly cleared, so that by 2 dpi, the fungal burden in CEA10-infected larvae is significantly lower than that of Af293-infected larvae. Additionally, by 3 dpi, CEA10 fungal burden is significantly less than the initial dose. Af293 is never significantly cleared compared to the initial burden under the experimental conditions. We also confirmed that this trend holds for multiple Af293- and CEA10-derived strains, as well as the parental strains (S1 Fig). Fig 1.

See also S1 Fig.Myd88-mediated inflammatory activation is required for clearance of a CEA10-derived strain Compared to Af293, CEA10 differentially activates specific inflammatory pathways in mice [27], and we first hypothesized that the differential killing of CEA10 was due to greater inflammatory activation. We utilized an NF-κB RE:EGFP reporter line [33] to measure differences in NF-κB activation after infection with Af293- or CEA10-derived non-fluorescent strains in larval zebrafish. At 2 dpi, CEA10-infected larvae have significantly more GFP signal and therefore NF-κB activation than Af293-infected larvae at the infection site, indicating that NF-κB activation is correlated with fungal killing (Fig 2A and 2B). Fig 2. Inflammatory activation is required for clearance of a CEA10-derived strain. Open in a new tab A, B.

Intensity values and CFU analyses represent lsmeans ± SEM from three pooled experiments, P values calculated by ANOVA. P values for survival analyses calculated by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. See also S2 Fig.To determine whether general immune activation is required for fungal killing, we treated larvae with the corticosteroid dexamethasone immediately after spore injection. Neither Af293 nor CEA10 caused much death in control larvae, consistent with previous results in our zebrafish model and the idea that wild-type hosts can largely control Aspergillus infection [21]. Treatment with dexamethasone, however, caused both Af293- and CEA10-infected larvae to succumb rapidly and equally to infection (Fig 2C), consistent with the identical virulence of these two strains observed in a chemotherapeutic mouse model [26]. Control PBS-injected larvae treated with dexamethasone had minimal death (S2A Fig). Similar results were obtained after treatment with withaferin A, a non-specific inhibitor of NF-κB (S2B Fig). These results suggest that while CEA10 infection induces significantly more activation of NF-κB, under general immunosuppressive conditions, neither of these strains can be controlled by the host. Both dexamethasone and withaferin A have broad effects, therefore we next investigated the role of specific pathways upstream of NF-κB in fungal killing. Myd88 is an adaptor molecule downstream of TLR/IL-1R signaling that has previously been implicated in the response to Aspergillus [34, 35]. myd88-/- larvae are more susceptible to CEA10, but not Af293, infection compared to wild-type controls (Fig 2D), consistent with the idea that Myd88-mediated immune activation is required specifically for the response to CEA10. This increase in susceptibility to a CEA10 strain of myd88-/- larvae coincided with a significantly decreased ability to clear CEA10 fungal burden, while loss of Myd88 had no effect on Af293 fungal burden (Fig 2E and 2F). Knockdown of myd88 did not inhibit activation of the NF-κB RE:EGFP reporter line by a CEA10-derived strain (S2C and S2D Fig). This is could be due to 1) other pathways that also activate NF-κB and/or 2) increased fungal growth in these larvae resulting in more inflammation. Together, these results show that CEA10 induces a more robust inflammatory response than Af293 and Myd88-dependent signaling is required for clearance of CEA10 fungal burden.CEA10-induced inflammatory activation is not sufficient for killing of Af293 To specifically test whether the increased immune activation induced by this CEA10 infection is sufficient for fungal killing, we co-infected larvae with a red fluorescent Af293-derived strain and a green fluorescent CEA10-derived strain and performed CFU counts throughout a 5 day infection. As shown previously, in single infections this CEA10 strain is cleared over the course of infection while the Af293 strain persists (Figs 1D and 3A). In a co-infection, this same pattern remained—Af293 was not significantly cleared, even in the presence of an immune-activating CEA10 strain (Fig 3A). Imaging experiments confirmed that these spores can be found in the same or neighboring cells (Figs 3B, 3C and S3), suggesting that these killing differences are not due to local variation in immune activation, but instead to fungal-intrinsic phenotypes. Fig 3. CEA10-induced inflammatory activation is not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain. Open in a new tab A. Fungal burden was monitored by CFU platings from single homogenized larvae infected either singly with TFYL49.1 (CEA10) or TBK5.1 (Af293) or co-infected with both strains. Average injection CFUs: Af293 = 53, CEA10 = 47, co-infection = 21 Af293 + 27 CEA10. CFUs from 24 larvae (8 larvae per replicate) per condition per day were measured; lsmeans ± SEM are shown from three pooled experiments, P values calculated by ANOVA. B, C. Macrophage-membrane labeled larvae (mfap4:tomato-CAAX) were co-infected with YFP-expressing TBK1.1 (Af293) and AlexaFluor633-labeled CEA17 KU80Δ (CEA10) and imaged 1 dpi. Percentage of Af293 spores within 20 μm of a CEA10 spore in each larvae from two replicates was quantified (B). Each point represents one larvae, color-coded by replicate. Single z-slice images from a representative larvae (C) are shown. Scale bar represents 5 μm. See also S3 Fig.Macrophages form tight, persistent, and dynamic clusters around A. fumigatus To further determine the mechanism by which this CEA10 strain of A. fumigatus is killed, we utilized the multi-day imaging capabilities of larval zebrafish to monitor the recruitment and behavior of macrophages and neutrophils in individual larvae over the course of a five day infection. By following individual larvae with both labeled macrophage nuclei (mpeg1:mcherry-H2B) and neutrophils (lyz:BFP) throughout a 5 day infection, we aimed to determine both differences in immune cell recruitment within larvae over time and population-level differences between larvae infected with a CEA10-derived strain versus an Af293-derived strain. On a population level, CEA10 infection recruited more macrophages and neutrophils than Af293 infection, throughout the entire time course (Fig 4A and 4B). These differences were significant as early as 2 dpi and up to 5 dpi (Fig 4A and 4B). However, the number of macrophages and neutrophils present at the site of infection was also dynamic, fluctuating from day to day in individual larvae (Fig 4A and 4B). In general, immune cell recruitment peaked at 2 dpi, decreasing slowly afterwards, coinciding with the timeline of fungal clearance (Fig 1D). Fig 4. Macrophages form tight clusters around A. fumigatus. Open in a new tab A-D. Dual macrophage-nuclear (mpeg1:mcherry-H2B) and neutrophil (lyz:BFP) labeled larvae were infected with YFP- or GFP-expressing A. fumigatus TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) strains and imaged days 1–5 post injection. Macrophage (A) and neutrophil (B) recruitment as well as phagocyte cluster size (D) were quantified. Representative images (C, scale bar represents 20 μm) and pooled quantification from 3 experiments (A, B, D) are shown. Each line in graphs represents one larvae followed for the entire course of infection, lines are color-coded by replicate, bars represent pooled lsmeans ± SEM, P values calculated by ANOVA. Af293 n = 25, CEA10 n = 27 for macrophage and cluster area quantification; Af293 n = 17, CEA10 n = 18 for neutrophil quantification. E. Macrophage-membrane (mfap4:tomato-CAAX) labeled larvae were infected with CEA17 KU80Δ (CEA10) and imaged 3 dpi. Asterisks represent cell nuclei, arrows indicate cell-cell junctions. Scale bar represents 10 μm. See also S4 Fig.During this imaging, we were surprised to find that these recruited phagocytes form tight clusters around the injected A. fumigatus, as early as 1 dpi, that persist throughout the five day infection (Figs 4C, 4D and S4A, S1 Movie). These clusters were primarily made up of macrophages, but neutrophils also infiltrated, generally arriving after macrophages (Figs 4C and S4A). These macrophages form tight associations, with their membranes directly opposed and without space between the cells (Fig 4E). Germination of A. fumigatus spores inside the clusters could be found (S4A Fig). We also observed the apical extrusion of a cluster out of the hindbrain of two larvae, suggesting extrusion is a possible but rare mechanism for the host to eliminate the infection (S4B Fig). Quantification of phagocyte cluster size demonstrates that significantly larger clusters form in response to CEA10 compared to Af293, consistent with differences in observed numbers of phagocytes recruited (Fig 4C and 4D). Additionally, the size of these clusters is dynamic, changing in individual larvae throughout the course of infection, but also peaking at 2 dpi and decreasing in size as the infection is cleared (Fig 4C and 4D).A CEA10-derived strain is more virulent than an Af293-derived strain in a neutrophil-defective host Since macrophages are the predominant cell type infiltrating the site of infection and forming clusters around the fungus, we hypothesized that macrophages contribute to killing of CEA10-derived strains of A. fumigatus. Macrophages and neutrophils are the predominant immune cell types present in zebrafish larvae at this stage of development [36] and therefore, to determine the ability of macrophages alone to kill A. fumigatus in vivo, we performed fungal CFU counts after infection of a neutrophil-defective host (mpx:rac2D57N). These larvae express a dominant-negative copy of Rac2 under a neutrophil-specific promoter, preventing the migration of neutrophils out of the vasculature [37]. Consistent with previous observations (Fig 1), an Af293-derived strain was not significantly cleared in either neutrophil-defective or control hosts (Fig 5A). However, 2 dpi, neutrophil-defective larvae are able to decrease fungal burden of a CEA10-derived strain equivalently to the control, to ~60% of the initial dose (Fig 5A), indicating that early in infection macrophages have a low-level killing ability against CEA10. However, at 3 dpi, CFUs from these neutrophil-defective larvae increase, demonstrating that macrophages alone cannot contain the growth of CEA10 (Fig 5A). Because these larvae have fewer functional immune cells in total, we also tested a lower dose of CEA10, but found that the infectious dose did not have any effect on percent of fungal clearance (S5 Fig). Fig 5. A CEA10-derived strain is more virulent in a neutrophil-defective host. Open in a new tab Neutrophil-defective (mpx:rac2D57N) or control (mpx:rac2WT) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10). A. CFUs were monitored, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 36, CEA10 = 32. B. Larval survival was monitored, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 35, CEA10 = 27. For all analyses, data shown are from 3 pooled replicates. For CFU analysis, data represent lsmeans ± SEM, P values calculated by ANOVA. CFU data are from 24 larvae (3 replicates, 8 larvae each) per condition per day. For survival analysis, P values were calculated by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. See also S5 Fig.Over 80% of these neutrophil-defective larvae succumb to infection with CEA10 (Fig 5B). To compare the relative likelihood of neutrophil-defective larvae to succumb to CEA10 versus Af293 infection, we calculated hazard ratios, which represent the relative instantaneous risk of death throughout the experiment between two conditions. This calculation revealed that while neutrophil-defective larvae are significantly more susceptible to both Af293 and CEA10 infections than control larvae, these hosts are ~3 times more likely to succumb to CEA10 infection than Af293 infection (Fig 5B), consistent with our previous results in this zebrafish line [28]. So, while CEA10 is cleared significantly more than Af293 in wild-type larvae, it is also more virulent in a neutrophil-defective host. Altogether, these data suggest that macrophages do not account for the majority of fungal killing, instead implicating neutrophils.Macrophages provide a protective niche for CEA10 To specifically investigate the function of neutrophils in the response to these two A. fumigatus strains, we next infected macrophage-deficient larvae (irf8-/-). These zebrafish lack the transcription factor Irf8, and do not develop macrophages for the first 7 days after fertilization [38]. We again enumerated CFUs after infection with either an Af293-derived or a CEA10-derived strain. Remarkably, these macrophage-deficient larvae are able to clear CEA10 significantly more than control larvae (Fig 6A). While, again, wild-type hosts significantly decrease CEA10 fungal burden by 3 dpi, at 2 dpi almost 100% of injected CEA10 is cleared in macrophage-deficient hosts (Fig 6A). Consequently, when we monitored survival, CEA10-infected macrophage-deficient larvae succumbed to infection at an almost identical rate as wild-type controls (Fig 6B). Af293, on the other hand, was not significantly cleared in macrophage-deficient larvae (Fig 6A) and Af293 infection did result in significantly more death in macrophage-deficient larvae compared to controls (Fig 6B), consistent with previous results in zebrafish with this strain [21]. Fig 6. A CEA10-derived strain is cleared more efficiently by macrophage-deficient hosts than wild-type hosts. Open in a new tab A, B. Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) or control (irf8+/+) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) and CFUs (A) or larval survival (B) were monitored. For CFU experiments, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 23, CEA10 = 23. For survival experiments, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 44, CEA10 = 31. C, D. Macrophage-depleted (clodronate liposomes) or control (PBS liposomes) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) and CFUs (C) or larval survival (D) were monitored. Average injection CFUs: Af293 = 37, CEA10 = 40. For all analyses, data shown are from 3 pooled replicates. For CFU analyses, data represent lsmeans ± SEM, P values calculated by ANOVA. All CFU data are from 24 larvae (3 replicates, 8 larvae each) per condition per day. For survival analyses, P values were calculated by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. See also S6 Fig.As a consequence of Irf8 deficiency, these larvae also develop a larger number of neutrophils [38]. However, larvae injected with clodronate liposomes also cleared a CEA10-derived strain, but not an Af293-derived strain, significantly better than control PBS liposome-injected larvae at 1 dpi (Fig 6C). As clodronate liposome injection specifically depletes macrophages without affecting neutrophils (S6A Fig), this result suggests that this increased early clearance is a specific consequence of macrophage depletion. Clodronate liposome-injected larvae do however succumb to infection (Figs 6D and S6B), indicating either that a larger number of neutrophils is required for complete fungal clearance and host survival in the absence of macrophages, and/or that clodronate liposomes affect neutrophil function without altering neutrophil numbers. These data demonstrate that the presence of macrophages actually protects injected CEA10 spores, but not Af293 spores, from neutrophil-mediated killing at early time points after infection, and suggest that macrophages might provide a protective niche for survival of certain fungal strains.CEA10 recruits more neutrophils than Af293 in macrophage-deficient hosts To quantify neutrophil recruitment in the absence of macrophages, we performed sudan black staining 1 dpi in macrophage-deficient irf8-/- or control larvae (Fig 7A–7C). Strikingly, in ~50% of macrophage-deficient larvae infected with a CEA10-derived strain, we observed extensive neutrophil recruitment that resulted in a mass of sudan black staining (Fig 7A and 7B). These sudan black masses were also sometimes observed in macrophage-deficient larvae infected with an Af293-derived strain, but significantly less so, and were rarely observed in control infected larvae. We quantified the number of neutrophils recruited to the infection site, finding significantly more recruitment in irf8-/- larvae infected with an CEA10-derived strain compared to an Af293-derived strain (Fig 7C). These data indicate that in the absence of macrophages, high numbers of neutrophils are specifically recruited to CEA10 infections. Fig 7. More neutrophils are recruited to a CEA10-derived strain than an Af293-derived strain in the absence of macrophages. Open in a new tab A-D. Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) or control (irf8+/+) larvae were infected with YFP- or GFP-expressing A. fumigatus TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) strains, fixed 1 dpi, and stained for neutrophils (sudan black). Representative images are shown (A, scale bar represents 50 μm) and percent of larvae per experiment with sudan black masses (B), number of neutrophils at infection site (C), and percent of larvae per experiment with A. fumigatus hyphae (D) were quantified. N>9 larvae each condition each replicate. For percentage of larvae with sudan black masses or hyphae (B, D), each symbol represents one replicate, bars represent means ± SEM, P values calculated by t test. For neutrophil number quantification (C), each symbol represents one larvae. Larvae with sudan black masses where neutrophil numbers were difficult to count and represent underestimations are denoted with open symbols. Bars represent lsmeans ± SEM from 3 pooled replicates, P values calculated by ANOVA. All symbols are color-coded by replicate. E. Wild-type or myd88-/- embryos were injected with control (std) or macrophage-depleting (irf8) morpholinos. Larvae were then infected with TFYL49.1 (CEA10) spores and CFUs were measured. Average injection CFUs = 38. CFU data represent lsmeans ± SEM of 3 pooled replicates, n = 24 larvae (3 replicates, 8 larvae each) per condition per day, P values calculated with ANOVA. See also S7 Fig.Macrophages inhibit A. fumigatus germination These results raise the question of what signals promote neutrophil recruitment to CEA10 in the absence of macrophages. Since neutrophils have been reported to respond specifically to hyphal forms of A. fumigatus [21], we hypothesized that macrophages inhibit spore germination. Indeed, the massive neutrophil recruitment we observed in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient larvae was often accompanied by fungal germination and hyphal growth (Fig 7A). In fact, the percentage of larvae with hyphae present was higher in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient hosts compared to wild-type hosts after infection with either an Af293-derived or a CEA10-derived strain (Fig 7D), suggesting that the presence of macrophages inhibits A. fumigatus germination. Similar results were seen in clodronate liposome-injected larvae (S7A Fig). Previous experiments also suggest this rate of germination may be an underestimate for CEA10 infection since this fungus is cleared so effectively in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient conditions (Fig 6A). These data suggest that in the absence of macrophages, fungal germination induces signals that recruit neutrophils.Myd88 is not required for neutrophil-mediated fungal killing Germination unmasks fungal cell wall components such as β-glucans that can be sensed by the host through TLR and CLR pathways [18]. Given our previous observation that the signaling molecule Myd88 is required for full clearance of a CEA10 strain (Fig 2F), we hypothesized that Myd88 is involved in neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection after spore germination. While Myd88 has been shown to be dispensable for neutrophil-intrinsic anti-fungal activity, it can be required in other cell types such as epithelial cells for neutrophil recruitment to A. fumigatus infections [34]. To determine if neutrophil-mediated killing of CEA10 in the absence of macrophages requires Myd88 signaling, we combined the myd88-/- mutant line with macrophage-deficiency (irf8 morpholino). We performed CFU counts at just 1 dpi since neutrophil-mediated clearance of CEA10 in the absence of macrophages occurs rapidly (Fig 6A). Consistent with previous results, at 1 dpi CEA10 is not cleared in wild-type hosts, while Irf8 deficiency alone led to significantly increased clearance (Figs 7E and S7B). However, we observed virtually identical clearance in macrophage-deficient hosts that also lacked Myd88 (Figs 7E and S7B). These data demonstrate that Myd88 is not required for neutrophil-mediated killing of germinated spores of a CEA10-derived strain, but instead that neutrophil activation signals are likely transduced through other pathways.A CEA10-derived strain germinates earlier than an Af293-derived strain in vivo Given our findings that neutrophils respond primarily to germinated A. fumigatus spores and that neutrophils are much better fungal killers than macrophages, we hypothesized that the increased killing of CEA10 compared to Af293 might be attributable to differences in germination and hyphal growth of these strains. CEA10 has been shown to germinate faster than Af293 in liquid culture in vitro [28] and more germinated spores of CEA10 compared to Af293 were found in the lungs of infected mice [27], but germination rates of these two strains have not been directly measured in vivo. To measure fungal growth in vivo, we infected both wild-type and phagocyte-deficient (pu.1 morphant) larvae with YFP- or GFP-expressing spores of strains derived from either CEA10 or Af293. Phagocyte-deficient larvae succumb quickly to infection with either strain, but on average CEA10 infection results in death one day earlier than Af293 infection (Fig 8A), suggesting CEA10 grows faster in vivo. Similar results were obtained with several CEA10- and Af293-derived strains (S8 Fig). To directly monitor fungal development and growth over time, we imaged these larvae every day for five days of infection (or until larvae succumbed). After only 1 day of infection, we observed pervasive growth of CEA10 in phagocyte-deficient hosts (Fig 8B). While both Af293 and CEA10 spores had germinated after 1 day, CEA10 had already developed invasive hyphae throughout the hindbrain. We quantified how long it took individual larvae to exhibit both germinated spores (Fig 8C) and invasive hyphae (Fig 8D). These data confirmed that CEA10 both germinates significantly faster and grows into invasive hyphae significantly faster than Af293 in both wild-type and phagocyte-deficient hosts (Fig 8C and 8D). Quantification of fungal burden by measuring GFP+ area from these images also reflected greater growth of CEA10 and a ~1 day delay in Af293 growth (Fig 8E). Fig 8. A CEA10-derived strain germinates faster than an Af293-derived strain in vivo. Open in a new tab Wild-type or phagocyte-deficient (pu.1 morpholino) larvae were infected with YFP- or GFP-expressing A. fumigatus TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10).

Each line represents one larvae followed for the entire course of infection, lines are color-coded by replicate, bars represent pooled lsmeans ± SEM, P values were calculated by ANOVA. See also S8 Fig.Germination drives neutrophil-mediated fungal killing To investigate the role of germination in neutrophil recruitment, we injected heat-killed spores into macrophage-deficient irf8-/- larvae and quantified the presence of sudan black masses in the hindbrain that we observed previously (Fig 7A and 7B). We found that heat-killed spores do not recruit neutrophils, suggesting that spore germination and fungal growth is required for neutrophil recruitment (Fig 9A). Fig 9. Neutrophil-mediated killing requires germination. Open in a new tab A. Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) or control (irf8+/+) larvae were injected with live or heat-killed TFYL49.1 (CEA10), fixed 1 dpi, and stained for neutrophils (sudan black). Larvae were then scored for the presence or absence of a sudan black cluster or mass. This experiment was performed twice, data are shown from one representative replicate. B. Wild-type or phagocyte-deficient (pu.1 morphant) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293 pyrG+), Af293.1 (Af293 pyrG-), TFYL49.1 (CEA10 pyrG+), or CEA17 (CEA10 pyrG-) spores and survival was monitored. Data represent 2 pooled experiments. Average injection CFUs: Af293 pyrG+ = 52, Af293 pyrG- = 52, CEA10 pyrG+ = 38, CEA10 pyrG- = 48. C. Wild-type larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293 pyrG+), Af293.1 (Af293 pyrG-), TFYL49.1 (CEA10 pyrG+), or CEA17 (CEA10 pyrG-) and CFUs were monitored. Average injection CFUs: Af293 pyrG+ = 45, Af293 pyrG- = 48, CEA10 pyrG+ = 42, CEA10 pyrG- = 49. D. Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) larvae were infected with CEA17 KU80Δ (CEA10 pyrG+), or CEA17 (CEA10 pyrG-) and CFUs were monitored. Average injection CFUs: CEA10 pyrG+ = 41, CEA10 pyrG- = 45. All CFU data represent lsmeans ± SEM from 3 pooled replicates composed of 24 larvae (8 larvae per replicate) per condition per day. P values were calculated by ANOVA. See also S9 Fig.However, immune cell killing activity against heat-killed spores cannot be measured, therefore to investigate the role of germination in fungal clearance, we utilized A. fumigatus pyrG-deficient strains, which are auxotrophic for uridine-uracil and are known to have impaired germination and attenuated virulence in mice [39]. To determine if these strains also have impaired germination in larval zebrafish we infected phagocyte-deficient larvae (pu.1 morphant) and measured survival as well as germination. Indeed, germination of a CEA10-derived pyrG-deficient strain is abrogated in larval zebrafish and both CEA10- and Af293-derived pyrG-deficient strains cause minimal death in both wild-type and phagocyte-deficient larvae (Figs 9B and S9). We infected wild-type larvae with Af293 and CEA10 pyrG- and pyrG+ reconstituted strains and performed CFU counts to determine the requirement for germination in fungal killing in the presence of both macrophages and neutrophils. Again, Af293 was not cleared significantly and the pyrG mutation did not have a significant effect on fungal burden in this strain background (Fig 9C). In a CEA10 infection, both a pyrG+ strain and pyrG- strain had significant levels of killing by 3 dpi and CFU counts from larvae infected with these strains were virtually identical 5 dpi (Fig 9C). These data suggest that in wild-type larvae germination is not required for fungal clearance, although we cannot rule out the possibility that pyrG-deficient spores do eventually germinate at later time points in infection. To determine the requirement for germination in neutrophil-mediated killing, we determined the effect of pyrG deficiency in the specific context of CEA10 killing in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient hosts (Fig 6A). In these larvae, neutrophils effectively clear ~85% of CEA10 pyrG+ fungal burden by 1 dpi (Fig 9D). However, a CEA10 pyrG- infection is cleared significantly less in this context. At 3 dpi, there is no difference in pyrG- fungal clearance between irf8-/- macrophage-deficient larvae and wild-type larvae. These data indicate that pyrG-deficient CEA10 cannot be cleared by neutrophils, even in the absence of macrophages, suggesting that neutrophil-mediated clearance of CEA10 is dependent on germination. Together, these data demonstrate that germination drives neutrophil-mediated killing of A. fumigatus, and explain why a faster germinating strain is actually cleared more effectively by innate immune cells than a slower-growing strain (Fig 10). Fig 10. Model of neutrophil and macrophage responses to Aspergillus fumigatus. Open in a new tab Upon infection, A. fumigatus spores are taken up by macrophages, which form dense clusters around the fungus and inhibit spore germination. Macrophages provide a protective niche for spore survival, as neutrophil-mediated killing of A. fumigatus requires germination. As a result, in infections with slow-germinating A. fumigatus strains, the fungus persists for days, while in infections with fast-germinating A. fumigatus strains, germination drives neutrophil recruitment, neutrophil-mediated killing, and faster fungal clearance. Macrophages have some anti-fungal activity, dependent on Myd88-NF-κB signaling, however NF-κB activation is not sufficient to kill slow-germinating strains.Discussion Here we have used larval zebrafish to image Aspergillus fumigatus infection in live, intact hosts, over the course of a multi-day infection to visualize and quantify both immune cell behavior and fungal development and growth. Using a method to visually quantify spore killing, we find that faster-growing CEA10-derived strains of A. fumigatus are cleared significantly better than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. We report that clearance of CEA10-derived strains is primarily due to neutrophil function and is driven by fungal germination, whereas slower-growing Af293-derived strains do not recruit as many neutrophils and therefore can persist in the host for >5 days. Many fungal pathogens can survive within macrophages [40], but the role of macrophages in vivo in A. fumigatus pathogenesis has remained ambiguous, and we find that macrophages form tight clusters around injected spores. Macrophages inhibit spore germination, and without spore germination, neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing are diminished, thus macrophages act as a protective niche against neutrophil-mediated killing (Fig 10). The phagocyte clusters that we observe are reminiscent of aspergillomas or “fungal granulomas” that are found in lung or intracranial lesions of human patients [41, 42]. These macrophage-driven phagocyte clusters have never been observed before in an animal model of Aspergillus infection, but phagocyte clustering is a common phenomenon in infections, with the mycobacteria granuloma as the classic example [43]. We do find some neutrophils infiltrating into these clusters and neutrophil aggregates have been reported in response to both to Aspergillus [12] and Candida [44]. Zebrafish larvae have been an ideal model in which to detect phagocyte clusters, and they have been found in response to not just mycobacteria [45], but also Streptococcus iniaie [46] and Mucor circinelloides [47]. In tuberculosis, granulomas can provide bacterial-protective functions [48] and macrophages can also act as protective niches for other pathogens [49]. In vivo, in larval zebrafish, macrophages do not have much spore killing ability, in contrast to what has been found in vitro [4, 5], but in line with some in vivo mouse experiments [6]. While in other mouse experiments macrophage depletion led to an increase in A. fumigatus fungal burden [7], we hypothesize that the protective niche function of macrophages is only relevant at lower doses of spores, not at the dose given in these experiments (~107). Our data suggest that the protective niche function of macrophages arises simply by inhibition of fungal germination (Fig 10). While it is also possible that macrophages actively repel neutrophils, as we have observed this behavior in other inflammatory contexts [50], we cannot conclude this from the data presented here. Neutrophils are highly efficient killers of A. fumigatus, and we find that this killing is largely dependent on germination. Whether neutrophils respond directly to signals exposed on hyphae or if epithelial cells and/or macrophages sense hyphae and recruit neutrophils in this context is not known. In mice, the neutrophil response to CEA10 is dependent on IL-1α production [27]. IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling requires the Myd88 adaptor protein, but our experiments with myd88-/- larvae demonstrate that Myd88 is not required for neutrophil recruitment and killing in this context. The Card9 adaptor can also transduce fungal signals to recruit neutrophils [34], and we hypothesize that this signaling is occurring in macrophage-deficient larvae to recruit neutrophils. Interestingly, in mice, neutrophil recruitment to Af293 and CEA10 infections is driven by different pathways and signals, in agreement with the differences we observe in the ability of these strains to recruit neutrophils [27]. In addition to inducing neutrophil recruitment, germination likely also makes A. fumigatus more susceptible to host killing mechanisms in vivo. In fact, we find that a slower-germinating Af293-derived strain is not effectively killed by the host even in a co-infection with a faster-germinating CEA10-derived strain. Hyphal growth and branching increases susceptibility to neutrophil-mediated killing in vitro [51], and it has long been thought that neutrophils are much more effective killers against hyphae than conidia [52]. One immune mechanism that neutrophils use against hyphae is neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are observed in infected mouse lung tissue containing hyphae [20, 53]. In the absence of macrophages and the increased presence of hyphae we observed large masses of sudan black staining at the site of infection that are reminiscent of NETs. Sudan black stains neutrophil granules, and therefore these masses could be actual NETs, neutrophil degranulation, or simply massive neutrophil recruitment. It is worth noting that in imaging neutrophils expressing a cytosolic fluorescent protein recruited to the site of infection we could sometimes see a haziness in that channel suggesting neutrophil lysis, but could not prove the origin of this signal. Differences in virulence between Af293 and CEA10 are also observed in murine models of Aspergillus infection. In a chemotherapeutic model of immunosuppression, infection with either of these strains caused similar rates of host death [26], a situation that may be similar to our dexamethasone-treated zebrafish larvae (Fig 2C). In a less immunosuppressed triamcinolone-treated mouse model, CEA10 is more virulent [26]. However, this increase in virulence is thought to be a result of increased resistance to hypoxia, a hallmark of this model [26], while we do not know the hypoxic state of our zebrafish immunosuppression models. Murine studies have correlated the increased growth and germination of CEA10 compared to Af293 with increased tissue damage [27], but have also found that increased growth in vitro across multiple environmental and clinical isolates correlates with increased host survival in the triamcinolone-treated mouse model [26], possibly consistent with our findings that increased growth leads to increased host response and clearance mechanisms. Between these strains of A. fumigatus, we have identified two different virulence mechanisms, both of which are commonly observed in a variety of human pathogens. CEA10-derived strains can germinate quickly in vivo, and therefore under neutrophil-deficient conditions can cause disease and spread. On the other hand, Af293-derived strains do not germinate quickly but instead can persist largely undetected in the host. This latter mechanism is similar to one proposed for a different Aspergillus species, A. terreus [54], and for the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans [55]. These two different mechanisms highlight the contradiction underlying Aspergillus pathogenesis: while germination is required for virulence, it simultaneously activates the immune system and immune mechanisms that can kill the fungus. These ideas are relevant for the development and deployment of anti-Aspergillus treatments. Are there particular host scenarios in which it is better to simply inhibit germination and allow Aspergillus spores to persist? Or others where it is better to induce germination to activate host immune responses? Drugs that target macrophages to both maintain their ability to inhibit germination and increase neutrophil recruitment could provide the best possible scenario for future immunotherapies. Future investigation of the mechanisms behind each of these macrophage behaviors will be required to further understand the molecules and pathways involved.Methods Ethics statement Animal care and use protocol M005405-A02 was approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS) Animal Care and Use Committee.

Prior to any experimental manipulation, larvae were anesthetized in E3 water containing 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate, Sigma). All zebrafish lines used in this study are listed in Table 1. Previously published lines were genotyped as described in referenced publications. To generate lyz:BFP larvae, BFP was amplified by PCR (F: 5’-cagtgatacaggtacctcgccaccatgagcgagctgattaagg-3’, R: 5’-ctgattatgatctagatcacttgtgccccagtttgctagg-3’) and inserted by In-Fusion HD Cloning (Clontech) into a Tol2-lyz vector [60, 61] cut with KpnI/XbaI. ~90 pg of Tol2 plasmid was micro-injected with 75 pg of transposase mRNA into embryos at the single cell stage. mRNA was in vitro transcribed (mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit, Ambion) from a pCS2-transposase vector [62]. Larvae were screened for BFP expression in neutrophils at 2–3 days post fertilization (dpf) and grown up to establish a stable line. Table 1. Zebrafish lines used in this study.

MOs were then diluted in water with 0.5X CutSmart Buffer (NEB) and 0.1% phenol red and 3 nl was micro-injected into single-cell stage embryos. Injected concentrations of morpholinos were 0.4 mM (irf8 (ZFIN MO1: aatgtttcgcttactttgaaaatgg)[63]), 0.5 mM (pu.1 (ZFIN MO1: gatatactgatactccattggtggt)[64]), and 0.33 mM (myd88 (ZFIN MO2: gttaaacactgaccctgtggatcat)[65]). These injected amounts of irf8 and pu.1 MO are standard and efficacy of knockdown was previously confirmed [63, 64]. To confirm the splice-blocking effect of the myd88 morpholino at this concentration, RNA was isolated from individual larvae with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III RT and oligo-dT (Invitrogen). PCR was then performed with GoTaq (Promega) and primers for myd88 (F: 5’-atggcatcaaagttaagtatagacc-3’, R: 5’-agggcagtgagagtgctttg-3’) and ef1a (F: 5’-tgccttcgtcccaatttcag-3’, R: 5’-taccctccttgcgctcaatc-3’)[66]. Shifts in band size were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. For irf8 and myd88 MO injections, a standard control MO (GeneTools) was used at a matching concentration.Clodronate liposome injection At 1.5 dpf, 2 nl of clodronate or PBS liposomes (Liposoma) with 0.1% phenol red was micro-injected intravenously into the caudal vein plexus of transgenic larvae expressing a fluorescent macrophage marker. Macrophage depletion was confirmed 24 hours later by loss of signal on a fluorescent zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective) prior to hindbrain injection of A. fumigatus. Aspergillus fumigatus growth and spore microinjection All A. fumigatus strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. TBK4.1 was generated by transforming TFYL44.1 with pJMP4, encoding the A. fumigatus argB gene [72]. TBK5.1 was generated from TBK4.1 by fusing mCherry to the 3’ end of A. fumigatus gpdA and inserting the A. fumigatus pyrG gene, as described previously for YFP expression in TBK1.1 [21]. Spores were grown at 37°C on solid glucose minimal media (GMM) and prepared for injection as described previously [21]. For pyrG1 auxotrophs, 5.2 mM uridine and 5 mM uracil were added to GMM as supplements. Micro-injection of spore preparations into the hindbrain of 2 dpf larvae was performed as previously described [21]. We aimed for an infectious dose of ~30 spores per larvae. Actual spore injection doses were monitored by single larvae CFU platings on day 0 of infection as described below and are reported in figure legends for each experiment. Spores were heat-killed by incubation at 99°C for 30 min, with 300 rpm shaking. For survival and CFU experiments, individual larvae were maintained in 96-well plates. For imaging analyses, larvae were kept in 35 mm dishes or in 48-well plates. Table 2. Aspergillus fumigatus strains used in this study.

The entire volume was plated on a 10 cm GMM plate, incubated for two days at 37°C, and CFUs were counted. For each CFU experiment, ≥8 larvae were individually plated for each time point and each condition. For co-infection CFU experiments, fluorescence of colonies was visualized on a zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective) to specifically count colonies of each strain. All CFU data were normalized to the average initial injection dose for each replicate and condition.Live-dead spore labeling Spore cell walls were labeled with AlexaFluor molecules as previously described [10]. Briefly, biotin-XX, SSE (Life Technologies) was conjugated to spores in 0.05 M NaHCO3. Spores were washed in Tris-HCl pH 8 to deactivate free-floating biotin, then washed in PBS, and incubated with streptavidin-AF594 or -AF633 (Life Technologies). Labeling was confirmed by fluorescence imaging and spores were resuspended in PBS and injected as described above.Live imaging To prevent pigment formation, 0.2 mM N-phenylthiourea (PTU, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to E3 water 1 dpf. Larvae carrying fluorescent transgenes were pre-screened on a zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective) prior to the experiment. For daily imaging, larvae were maintained in single wells of a 48-well plate. Each day, larvae were removed, one at a time, anesthetized in E3 with Tricaine, and placed into zWEDGI chambers [73] to correctly orient their hindbrains towards the bottom of the dish. Images were acquired on a spinning disk confocal microscope (CSU-X; Yokogawa) with a confocal scanhead on a Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope, Plan-Apochromat NA 0.8/20x objective, and a Photometrics Evolve EMCCD camera. Images were acquired with ZEN software (Zeiss). After imaging was complete, larvae were washed in E3 with PTU and placed back into the same plate well. To image AlexaFluor-labeled spores, larvae were also imaged in zWEDGI chambers [73] on the same spinning disk confocal microscope with an EC Plan-Neofluar NA 0.75/40x objective. Clodronate-injected larvae were also imaged with the spinning disk confocal with a EC Plan-Neofluar NA 0.3/10x objective. To image GFP expression in the NF-κB RE:GFP line, 2 days post injection (dpi) larvae were mounted in a glass-bottom dish with 1% low-melting point agarose. Images were acquired with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (FluoView FV1000; Olympus) with an NA 0.75/20x objective and FV10-ASW software (Olympus). To image mfap4:tomato-caax larvae, larvae at 3 dpi (for macrophage cluster imaging) or 1 dpi (for co-infection imaging) were mounted in agarose and imaged on the Olympus laser-scanning confocal microscope as described above.Image analysis/processing In all displayed images, image histogram levels were adjusted in Fiji. For any experiments where fluorescence intensity of images was quantified, no alteration was made to images prior to analysis. To quantify killing of AlexaFluor-labeled spores (Fig 1B and 1C), alive and killed spores were manually counted in Fiji. Displayed images of Alexa-Fluor labeled spores were also processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold. To quantify GFP signal from the NF-κB RE:GFP zebrafish line (Fig 2A and 2B), a single slice from each z-stack representing the center of the hindbrain was isolated. In Fiji, the hindbrain region was manually identified in the corresponding brightfield image and the mean grey value as well as the integrated density (area × mean grey value) in that region in the GFP channel was measured. Displayed images of GFP signal were also processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold. Signal intensity is displayed with the 16 colors look up table. To quantify phagocyte recruitment and fungal growth (Figs 4, 7 and 8), z-stacks and/or maximum intensity projections were analyzed in Fiji. Cell numbers, phagocyte cluster area, and presence of germination and/or invasive hyphae were scored manually. 2D fungal area was calculated by thresholding. Images of phagocyte recruitment (Fig 4C) were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 0.75). Images in S1 Movie were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 1). The displayed image of tomato+ clustered cells (Fig 4E) was processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density four-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 2). For co-infection imaging quantification (Fig 3), pair-wise distances between spores in each larvae were measured manually in Fiji. Displayed images of co-infection were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 1). Whole larvae images of macrophages and neutrophils after clodronate injection (S6A Fig) were manually assembled. Images of A. fumigatus infected clodronate-depleted or control larvae (S7A Fig) were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 0.75).Drug treatments Dexamethasone (Sigma) was resuspended to a stock concentration of 10 mM in 100% ethanol. Larvae were treated with 10 μM dexamethasone, or equivalent ethanol control (0.1%) immediately after infection and the drug was left on larvae for the entirety of the experiment. Withaferin A was resuspended in DMSO to a stock concentration of 10 mM. 2 hpi, E3 was changed to E3 with 30 μM withaferin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or DMSO (0.3%). 24 hpi, drug was removed and larvae were placed back in E3 alone.Sudan black staining Sudan black staining was performed as described in protocol dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.rced2te. For visualization of sudan black staining (and YFP/GFP of injected fungus), larvae were placed into zWEDGI wells [73] to correctly orient their hindbrains and imaged on a spinning disk confocal microscope (CSU-X; Yokogawa) with a confocal scanhead on a Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope, Plan-Apochromat NA 0.8/20x objective, a Photometrics Evolve EMCCD camera, and ZEN software (Zeiss).Calcofluor white staining Larvae were anesthetized and placed on a glass slide. As much liquid as possible was removed, 5 μl of 1 g/L calcofluor white was pipetted on top of the larvae, and a glass coverslip was placed on top. Smashed larvae were imaged for the presence of calcofluor-white stained hyphae within 10 minutes on a Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope with a EC Plan-Neofluar NA 0.30/10x objective and epifluorescence images were taken with a Photometrics Coolsnap ES2 camera and ZEN software (Zeiss).Statistical analyses For all statistical analyses, three independent experiments were performed. Experimental Ns are noted in figures and/or figure legends. For larval survival data and analysis of cumulative germination and invasive hyphal occurrence in larvae, replicates were pooled and analysed by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, with experimental replicate included as a group variable. In addition to pair-wise P values, this analysis also calculates hazard ratios, which are sometimes displayed. The hazard ratio can be interpreted as the relative death rate and represents the relative instantaneous risk of death throughout the experiment between two conditions. For quantification of imaging experiments (spore killing, intensity, cell counts, cluster area, or fungal area) and for CFU quantification, pooled data from three replicates was compared between experimental conditions using analysis of variance. Results are summarized in terms of least-squared adjusted means (lsmeans) and standard error (SEM). In some cases, graphs show both calculated lsmeans ± SEM and individual data points, color-coded by replicate. For data in Fig 7B and 7D, representing percent of larvae per experiment over three experiments, P values were calculated by t test and regular means ± SEM are displayed. Statistical analyses and graphical representations were done in R version 3.4, GraphPad Prism version 6, and/or Microsoft Excel 2016.Supporting information S1 Fig. Multiple CEA10-derived strains are cleared faster than multiple Af293-derived strains in vivo.Wild-type larvae were infected with Af293-derived strains (Af293, TBK1.1, TBK5.1) or CEA10-derived strains (CEA10, CEA17 KU80Δ, TFYL49.1) and fungal burden was monitored by CFUs.

KEYWORDS: Aspergillus fumigatus, space station, UV-C, melanin, secondary metabolite, spore, virulence determinantsABSTRACT Fungi are versatile organisms which thrive in hostile environments, including the International Space Station (ISS). Several isolates of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus have been found contaminating the ISS, an environment with increased exposure to UV radiation. Secondary metabolites (SMs) in spores, such as melanins, have been shown to protect spores from UV radiation in other fungi. To test the hypothesis that melanin and other known spore SMs provide UV protection to A. fumigatus isolates, we subjected SM spore mutants to UV-C radiation. We found that 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin mutants of two clinical A. fumigatus strains (Af293 and CEA17) but not an ISS-isolated strain (IF1SW-F4) were more sensitive to UV-C than their respective wild-type (WT) strains. Because DHN-melanin has been shown to shield A. fumigatus from the host immune system, we examined all DHN mutants for virulence in the zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis. Following recent studies highlighting the pathogenic variability of different A. fumigatus isolates, we found DHN-melanin to be a virulence factor in CEA17 and IF1SW-F4 but not Af293. Three additional spore metabolites were examined in Af293, where fumiquinazoline also showed UV-C-protective properties, but two other spore metabolites, monomethylsulochrin and fumigaclavine, provided no UV-C-protective properties. Virulence tests of these three SM spore mutants indicated a slight increase in virulence of the monomethylsulochrin deletion strain. Taken together, this work suggests differential roles of specific spore metabolites across Aspergillus isolates and by types of environmental stress.INTRODUCTION Recent revitalization of the interest in human outer space explorations has brought attention to the question of whether and how microbes, particularly pathogenic microbes, respond and adapt to space conditions (1–4). Being ubiquitous in the environment and isolated from a variety of extreme and built environments, fungi are compelling microorganisms to evaluate such adaptive responses (5–9). Further, fungal presence aboard spacecraft, including the International Space Station (ISS), has been documented (10–12). Of concern is the occurrence of potential human pathogens, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, the causal agent of invasive aspergillosis, in the ISS (1). UV radiation is known to be enhanced in spacecraft and stations (13). UV may be detrimental to living organisms since it causes DNA damage and induces mutations in both direct and indirect ways by forming pyrimidine dimers and inducing oxidative stress via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively (14, 15). Among three wave bands, UV-A (320 to 400 nm), UV-B (290 to 320 nm), and UV-C (100 to 290 nm), UV-C is known for its germicidal properties and is used as a sanitizing agent (14, 16, 17). In order to protect from damaging UV exposure, fungi have developed various defense mechanisms, including enzymes degrading ROS, DNA repair mechanisms like photoreactivation and nucleotide excision repair, and the production of UV-protective compounds like melanins and other secondary metabolites (SMs) (18). Fungi produce a diverse variety of SMs that can protect a fungus from harmful environmental factors or from competing microorganisms (19). Several studies have correlated increased conidial melanin content with UV protection in highly irradiated areas, including Chernobyl Power Plant accident sites, the ISS, and “Evolution Canyon” (20–22). Further, albino mutants have been shown to have less fitness in the field, presumably due to the loss of melanin (23). In addition to protecting fungi from UV radiation, fungal melanins are potent virulence factors in both human-pathogenic (e.g., Cryptococcus neoformans [24], Fonsecaea pedrosoi [25], and A. fumigatus [26]) and plant-pathogenic (e.g., Venturia inaequalis [27] and Verticillium dahliae [28]) fungi. The A. fumigatus conidial melanin, 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin, thwarts immune cell attack through various mechanisms, including masking of fungal pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and sequestration of signaling molecules such as calcium (29, 30). However, it is unknown if this pigment provides protection to A. fumigatus from UV radiation. The findings that two ISS-isolated strains of A. fumigatus showed increased virulence in a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis (IA) (1) and also presented an increase in proteins associated with SM biosynthesis, including trypacidin, Asp-hemolysin, and melanin (3), compared to clinical strains CEA10 and Af293, suggested a possible correlation between conidium-associated SMs, UV-C sensitivity, and virulence. To address any possible linkage of increased UV-C resistance and virulence mechanisms of pathogenic fungi aboard the ISS, the UV-C sensitivity and pathogenicity of DHN-melanin mutants in three diverse strains of A. fumigatus, including one ISS strain, were evaluated. Because UV is also absorbed by additional aromatic fungal SMs and certain amino acids such as tryptophan and tyrosine (31, 32), any role for three aromatic conidial SMs (trypacidin, fumiquinazoline, and fumigaclavine) for protection from UV-C or impact on virulence in one A. fumigatus strain were also examined. Finally, we examined any role of the DNA repair ku70 and ku80 mutants on UV-C sensitivity, as these mutants are frequently used for molecular manipulation of the A. fumigatus genome due to the ease of gene replacement in these backgrounds and the general robust nature of these mutants (33). Due to an existing gap in our understanding of UV-C resistance and virulence mechanisms and to the persistence of fungi aboard the ISS, it was prudent to investigate any possible correlations which may result in developing preventive measures for outer space explorations.RESULTS Loss of aku leads to enhanced UV-C sensitivity but has no effect on secondary metabolite production. Three control strains, namely, Af293, an ΔakuA mutant, and a ΔakuA -mluc mutant, were examined to demonstrate the impact of the disruption of akuA in UV-C response. This deletion allows for homologous recombination and thus creates a fungus that is easy to genetically manipulate and allows for faster creation of specific mutant strains (33). However, AkuA is involved in DNA repair (34) and would be expected to show enhanced sensitivity to UV treatment. The disruption of akuA significantly decreased the survival rate, at 90%, in contrast to 60% decrease in survival of wild-type (WT) Af293 upon UV-C exposure (Fig. 1A); however, there were no differences in UV-C sensitivity between the ΔakuA mutant and the ΔakuA mluc strain (35), which was also used for gene deletion studies (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Despite an increase in sensitivity to UV-C, the ΔakuA mutant strains still demonstrated a dose response to increasing UV-C and thus were deemed suitable for this study. There were no differences in SM profiles between the WT Af293, ΔakuA mutant, and ΔakuA -mluc mutant strains (Fig. 1B). FIG 1.

DHN-melanin is a UV-C protectant in some A. fumigatus isolates. Fungal melanins are derived either from an l-dopa biosynthetic pathway (e.g., C. neoformans) or a polyketide biosynthetic pathway (A. fumigatus DHN-melanin) (36). DHN-melanin was tested as a protective molecule from UV-C radiation by deleting pksP encoding the polyketide synthase required for DHN-melanin biosynthesis (37) in both WT Af293 and in the Af293 ΔakuA background. As shown in Fig. 2A, the loss of pksP resulted in strains more sensitive to UV-C regardless of the presence or absence of akuA. This increase in sensitivity was seen at all UV-C doses in a comparison of the WT to the ΔpksP mutant (∼50% versus ∼25% survival rate at 10 mJ/cm2, ∼23% versus ∼3.5% at 15 mJ/cm2, and ∼7% versus ∼0.9% at 20 mJ/cm2, respectively) and in a comparison of the ΔakuA mutant to the ΔakuA ΔpksP double mutant (∼7% versus ∼3% at 10 mJ/cm2, 2% versus 0.5% at 15 mJ/cm2, and ∼1% versus 0.1% at 20 mJ/cm2, respectively) (Table S2A). Chemical profiling of these strains did not show any differences in the production of other SMs due to the loss of pksP (Fig. 2B), but, as expected, both ΔpksP and ΔakuA ΔpksP conidia showed a lack of DHN-melanin pigmentation (Fig. S1).

Since DHN-melanin was critical in protecting conidia from UV-C radiation in the Af293 background, it was further examined whether this role was conserved in other A. fumigatus isolates, including the ISS-isolated strain IF1SW-F4. Upon exposure to UV-C, it was observed that PksP loss did not significantly diminish the survival of the ISS isolate compared to respective control strain producing DHN-melanin (Fig. 3A and Table S2C). SMs were quantified in these strains and showed no differences in the IF1SW-F4 WT or ΔpksP strains (Fig. 3B). Simultaneously, the impact of DHN-melanin on UV-C sensitivity was tested in CEA17 (CEA17 is a CEA10 derivative deleted for AkuB, which forms the functional heterodimer with AkuA [38, 39]). Unlike the IF1SW-F4 ΔpksP mutant but similar to the Af293 ΔpksP mutants, the CEA17 ΔpksP strain showed a significantly decreased survival rate compared to that of the CEA17 control (Fig. 3C and Table S2B), with values similar to those observed in Af293 with the disrupted AkuA background (∼5% versus ∼2% survival rate at 10 mJ/cm2 and ∼0.6% versus ∼0.4% at 15 mJ/cm2, respectively). Further, the CEA17 ΔpksP strain showed alterations in its SM profile, including decreased yields of pyripyropene A and fumagillin compared to the control strain (Fig. 3D, peaks 3 and 4, respectively).

Asterisks (*) indicate statistical significance using Welch’s corrected t test (details in Table S2).Fumiquinazoline provides protection from UV radiation. Aspergillus fumigatus produces other conidial metabolites, including fumigaclavine, trypacidin, and fumiquinazoline (40–42) (Fig. S2). Due to their synthesis in the spore as well as aromatic structure and incorporation of tryptophan in two of these metabolites (fumigaclavine and fumiquinazoline), they were tested to determine if they might also provide protection from UV-C in Af293. Mutants were created for all three metabolites in both WT akuA and ΔakuA mutant backgrounds (Fig. S3). SM analysis of these deletion mutants confirmed that they did not synthesize the targeted metabolite. Specifically, fumigaclavine C (366.5 g/mol), monomethylsulochrin (346.3 g/mol), and fumiquinazolines C and D (443.5 g/mol) were not detected in extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of the respective deletion mutants (Fig. S4). Considering that trypacidin is not detectable until 9 to 10 days of growth, monomethylsulochrin (the final intermediate of the trypacidin biosynthetic pathway) was used to confirm the disruption of the trypacidin biosynthetic pathway. In the WT background, the fumiquinazoline mutant (ΔfmqA) was more sensitive to UV-C (35%) (Fig. 4C and Table S2D), but the loss of either fumigaclavine (ΔdmaW mutant) or trypacidin (ΔtpcC mutant) pathway metabolites had no impact on spore survival (Fig. 4A and B and Table S2D). However, examination of these same SM mutations in the ΔakuA background gave different results, where strains deficient in fumigaclavine A (ΔakuA ΔdmaW mutant) and trypacidin (ΔakuA ΔtpcC mutant) were slightly more resistant to UV-C than was the ΔakuA control after exposure to 10 mJ/cm2 (P = 0.0043 and 0.0006, respectively) (Fig. 4D and E and Table S2E) and the fumiquinazoline null strain (ΔakuA ΔfmqA mutant) showed no significant change in UV-C resistance compared to ΔakuA (Fig. 4F and Table S2D compared to 2E). These findings suggested that akuA loss alters the UV-C-protective properties of some conidial pigments and may allow for the identification of mutants that can enhance UV-C resistance. FIG 4.

DHN-melanin role in virulence in three A. fumigatus isolates does not correlate with its role in UV-C protection. Considering the differential role of DHN-melanin in shielding the three strains from UV-C damage (Fig. 2 and 3), the known role of DHN-melanin in the virulence of some A. fumigatus strains (35), and differences in virulence between Af293 and CEA10 strains (43–46), we thought it important to assess the virulence of the three ΔpksP mutants. pksP deletion mutants were examined for changes in virulence relative to their respective WT controls using an established neutrophil-defective (rac2D57N) zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis (46, 47). Whereas both the CEA17 and IF1SW-F4 ΔpksP mutant strains were significantly decreased in virulence, the Af293 ΔpksP mutant was not (Fig. 5). FIG 5.

DPI, days postinfection.We also assessed the virulence of the ΔtpcC, ΔfmqA, and ΔdmaW mutants in the same zebrafish model. The loss of either fmqA or dmaW showed no difference in zebrafish deaths in comparison to the Af293 WT; however, the ΔtpcC mutant had a 10% increase in zebrafish deaths (Fig. 6). Together, our results suggest that the involvement of spore SMs in virulence is strain dependent and that their protective roles in fungal biology vary with the type of environmental stress. FIG 6.

P values were generated by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.DISCUSSION While the radiation-protective properties of melanin in fungi have been previously documented (21, 22, 48, 49), little is known about the UV-C-protective features of other SMs or of DHN-melanin in A. fumigatus. Since A. fumigatus strains have been isolated from space station environments characterized by high UV-C levels (12) and increased virulence (1), it was prudent to investigate the UV-C properties of conidial SMs and their plausible correlation with pathogenicity. Here, we found that DHN-melanin protects some but not all A. fumigatus isolates from UV-C radiation and that fumiquinazolines are UV-C protectants in WT Af293. This study demonstrated that akuA, which plays fundamental role in the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, a preferred DNA repair pathway of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in fungi (50–52), is critical in protection from UV-C. The disruption of akuA gene, which increases the transformation success rate via homologous recombination (HR), led to a ca. 90% decrease in survival upon exposure to the lowest UV-C dose, 10 mJ/cm2, while the Af293 WT showed a decrease of 60% for the same dose (Fig. 1A). Such discrepancy in the survival rates between the ΔakuA mutant and the WT was of no surprise, as previous reports showed that UV-C exposure significantly induces DSB incidence in exposed organisms and cells (53, 54). Further, no significant differences were observed in the SM profiles of the tested control strains (Fig. 1B), suggesting that akuA gene disruption was the main cause of the observed drop in strain survival upon UV-C exposure. However, we found that using an akuA null background could mask the ability to identify UV-C-protective SMs, possibly dependent on the relative contributions of each metabolite. For instance, the deletion of pksP in Af293 resulted in increased sensitivity to UV-C regardless of the akuA background (Fig. 2), but the protective property of fumiquinazoline was masked in the ΔakuA background (Fig. 4C versus F). Unexpectedly, during the study, it was noticed that the UV-C-protective property of DHN-melanin was strain dependent. Previous studies with other fungi have demonstrated the importance of DHN-melanin in UV protection (21, 22, 48), but an examination of melanin in different isolates within a species has not been reported, to our knowledge. Af293, CEA10, and CEA17 are commonly studied clinical strains of A. fumigatus (33, 45, 55) and in IF1SW-F4, a strain previously reported as being isolated from the ISS (1). Further, DHN-melanin-deficient strain CEA17, but not strain IF1SW-F4, was more sensitive to UV-C (Fig. 3). These data suggest that there might be other metabolites which are important for tolerating the UV-C stress in IF1SW-F4. We also note that different A. fumigatus strains synthesize different SMs and different amounts of each SM which could contribute to differences in UV-C sensitivity (Fig. 3) (1, 42). Such UV-C-protective compounds are of paramount importance during future outer space explorations, as they may be implemented to protect other organisms, including humans and plants (56). Considering the differential role of DHN-melanin in UV protection coupled with the already-known differences in Af293, CEA10, and CEA17 virulence (43–46, 57, 58), we speculated that PksP might also play a differential role in virulence dependent on A. fumigatus strains. Using the neutrophil-deficient zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis (46), we found this to be true but not in the manner we had anticipated. We had hypothesized that there might be a correlation between the importance of DHN-melanin in UV-C protection (where PksP protected Af293 and CEA17; Fig. 2 and 3) and virulence, but instead, we found that the CEA17 and IF1SW-F4 ΔpksP mutants (but not the Af293 mutant) showed a loss in virulence as measured by zebrafish mortality (Fig. 5). CEA17 showed the most significant attenuation of virulence of the two isolates. Different strains of A. fumigatus, including CEA10 (and derivatives such as CEA17) and Af293, have previously been shown to vary in virulence (in human cells [55], Drosophila melanogaster [43], murine [44, 59] and zebrafish [1, 40] models). DHN-melanin is an important cell wall component that impacts cell wall morphology and assembly (60) and has been shown to be involved in the protection of conidia from the host immune cells in A. fumigatus ATCC 46645 (61). The results from both the UV-C sensitivity tests together with the virulence assessment suggest that the role of DHN-melanin in conidial protection varies with the type of environmental stress. This work also presented the findings that other conidial SMs, in this case, fumiquinazoline, can protect from UV-C radiation. Fumiquinazoline C is composed of three residues, including the aromatic amino acid tryptophan and its precursor anthranilic acid (62). We hypothesize that this metabolite may contribute to UV production, possibly through tryptophan- and anthranilic acid-absorbing properties, and that its protective properties were masked in the highly UV-sensitive ΔakuA background (Fig. 4). We found that the loss of fumigaclavine or trypacidin intermediates had no impact on UV-C protection in an AkuA WT background, and these strains were actually more resistant to UV-C in the akuA background than control strains (Fig. 4). The increased resistance might possibly be explained by findings where the loss of one SM often results in increased synthesis of another SM (63), possibly one with some UV-C protection in this case. We had thought that trypacidin loss would result in increased sensitivity to UV-C, as several of its precursors (e.g., emodin and questin) are pigmented anthraquinones that have been shown to protect Xanthoria elegans and Cetraria islandica against UV (42, 64). Possibly, there are not enough anthraquinones synthesized in Af293 to have a measurable effect on UV sensitivity. We further assessed the impact of the loss of these SMs on virulence in the zebrafish model and found no correlation to sensitivity to UV-C (Fig. 4 and 6). These results parallel our observations on DHN-melanin loss, namely, that each SM may have differential role dependent on environmental stress. This study is the first comprehensive report to show the impact of conidium-associated SMs of A. fumigatus on UV-C protection and virulence. The results demonstrated strain-dependent involvement of DHN-melanin in both UV-C protection and virulence, highlighting that the role of fungal SMs cannot be generalized across a species. We also identify fumiquinazoline as playing a role in UV-C protection in strain Af293. In-depth analyses with regard to A. fumigatus virulence factors and UV-C resistance are important especially in isolated environments such as the space station. IF1SW-F4, isolated from the ISS and shown to be more virulent than both Af293 and CEA10 (1), but possibly, the molecules and properties leading to increased virulence are different from those of Af293 or CEA10. Such understanding may help develop and promote safety precautions for astronauts during long-term space explorations.MATERIALS AND METHODS Fungal strains and growth conditions. The strains used in this study are listed in Table S1. The generated mutants were stored in 30% (vol/vol) glycerol in 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 80 at −80°C. Strains were activated and grown at 37°C on glucose minimal medium (GMM; 6 g/liter NaNO3, 0.52 g/liter KCl, 0.52 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 1.52 g/liter KH2PO4, 10 g/liter d-glucose, 15 g/liter agar supplemented with 1 ml/liter trace elements) for 3 days to collect and enumerate conidia in 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 80. For UV-C exposure and secondary metabolite (SM) analysis, approximately 102 conidia per plate (diameter, 10 cm) were suspended in 5 ml of GMM agar containing half of the agar concentration (top agar) and grown at 37°C for 7 days. For assessment of virulence in larval zebrafish, plates were inoculated with 1 × 106 conidia of the appropriate fungal strain and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. Conidia were harvested in 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 80 using a cell spreader and filtered through Miracloth. Conidial stocks for microinjection were resuspended in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1.5 × 108 conidia/ml.Construction of mutants. To create the ΔpksP mutant in IF1SW-F4, the CRISPR-Cas9 system developed by the Mortensen lab was used (65). In brief, the IF1SW-F4 was tested for antibiotic sensitivity against hygromycin (hyg) and phleomycin (ble) to determine the selection marker and associated plasmid for targeting pksP. The strain showed sensitivity to 80 μg/ml hyg; hence, the plasmid pFC332 containing the hyg cassette was used for fungal transformation. Further, the 20-bp sequence 5′-ATC GCC AGC AAC GCC ACG CA-3′, a protospacer targeting pksP, was selected within the pksP gene and introduced to the pFC332 plasmid using the custom primers Fw1 (5′-TAG CTG TTT CCG CTG A-3′), Rev1 (5′-TGC GTG GCG TTG CTG GCG ATG ACG AGC TTA CTC GTT TCG TCC TCA CGG ACT CAT CAG ATC GCC CGG TGA TGT CTG CTC AAG-3′), Fw2 (5′-TCG TCA TCG CCA GCA ACG CCA CGC AGT TTT AGA GCT AGA AAT AGC AAG TTA A-3′), and Rev2 (5′-ATT CTG CTG TCT CGG CTG-3′). Upon this step, plasmid was propagated into Escherichia coli DH5α, purified using the QIAprep Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and used for transformation. Correct transformants were selected based on the loss of the pigment and used for downstream analyses. For gene deletion mutants, construction of the gene deletion cassette, production of protoplasts, and subsequent polyethylene glycol (PEG) transformation were performed as described previously (66). Briefly, primers (Table S3) were designed containing a 20- to 30-bp overlap were used to amplify 1,000-bp homologous regions of the gene of interest using SeqBuilder (DNAStar, Madison, WI).

These flanks were fused to a selectable marker containing either the A. fumigatus pyrG or Aspergillus parasiticus pyrG gene, amplified from the pKJA12 or pJW24 plasmids, respectively, and the resulting cassette was then transformed into the parent strain via PEG transformation (45). Strains were transformed using either Af293.1, providing a background with an intact akuA, or TFYL 80.1 for the ΔakuA background. Transformants were screened by selecting transformants that were able to grow in the absence of the appropriate supplements. Loss of the gene of interest and proper integration of the deletion construct were confirmed via PCR and Southern blot analysis (Fig. S3).UV-C exposure and survival evaluation. To evaluate the UV-C sensitivity of studied mutants, approximately 102 conidia/plate were exposed to various UV-C doses. Conidia were suspended in top GMM cooled to 55°C, and 5 ml of this suspension was added to plates with 20 ml of GMM (100% of the agar). Triplicates of each strain were exposed to 10-, 15-, and 20-mJ/cm2 doses of UV-C using a Hoefer UVC 500 crosslinker (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Upon exposure, treated and untreated (control plates) were incubated at 37°C. After 7 days, CFU were enumerated, and the percent survival was calculated using the following formula: no. of CFU exposed to any given dose (N)/CFU in control plate (N0) × 100. The results from three biological replicates were pooled and used for statistical analysis with GraphPad Prism 8 using Welch’s corrected t test.Secondary metabolite extraction and analysis. To examine the production of SMs of interest, agar plugs in triplicate were collected from unexposed plates. Plugs were extracted with 3 ml of methanol (MeOH) and 1:1 MeOH-DCM each, followed by 1 h of sonication. Crude extracts were evaporated in vacuo and extracted with 3 ml of ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The EtOAc layer was evaporated in vacuo to yield a residue suspended in 1 ml of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-MeOH, and 10 μl was examined by high-performance liquid chromatography–photodiode array detection–mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS) analysis. HPLC-MS was carried out using a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with a reverse-phase (RP) C18 column (Alltech Prevail C18, 3 mm, 2.1 by 100 mm) at a flow rate 125 μl/min. The solvent gradient for LC-MS was 95% methyl cyanide (MeCN)-H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN-H2O (solvent A), both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0% to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 35 min, 100% solvent B from 35 to 40 min, 100% to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and reequilibration with 0% solvent B from 45 to 50 min.Zebrafish care and maintenance. Adult zebrafish were reared as described previously (46). Briefly, adults were maintained on a dedicated aquatic system and subjected to a light/dark cycle of 14 h/10 h and fed twice a day. After spawning, embryos were collected in E3 buffer supplemented with methylene blue (MB) to inhibit fungal growth and incubated at 28.5°C. At 24 h postfertilization, embryos were manually decoryonated and transferred to E3 buffer lacking MB. Prior to microinjection, larvae were anesthetized in E3 buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate; Sigma-Aldrich). Larval zebrafish procedures and adult handling were performed in compliance with  guidelines and approved by the University of Wisconsin—Madison Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Larval zebrafish virulence assay. Virulence assays were performed using the larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis, as described previously (46), with slight modifications. Neutrophil-defective larvae were obtained genetically through the use of transgenic mpx:mCherry-2A-rac2D57N larvae (47). Prior to infection, larvae were screened and selected for mCherry expression in neutrophils to identify individuals harboring the dominant negative allele. Briefly, hindbrain ventricle infections were performed at 48 h postfertilization using conidial stocks that were mixed 2:1 with 1% phenol red (used to visualize injection success) to a final concentration of 1 × 108 conidia/ml stock. Larvae were anesthetized in E3 lacking MB and supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine prior to microinjection of 3 nl conidia stock or PBS vehicle control into the hindbrain ventricle through the otic vesicle. Following microinjection, larvae were rinsed several times to remove the anesthetic and transferred to individual wells of a 96-well plate in ∼200 μl E3 lacking MB. The survival of individual larvae was scored daily using a loss of heartbeat as a readout of mortality. Survival analysis for larval zebrafish infection experiments was performed as previously described (46) by pooling experimental replicates and generating P values by the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Part of the research described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

    "title": "Regulation of hemocytes in Drosophila requires dappled cytochrome b5.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092937/",
    "abstract": "Abstract A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is melanotic tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells, similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Viable mutations of dappled cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte misregulation during both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are similarly affected, but hemocyte number is different in females and males of both mutants and wild type. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the dappled melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. Overall, dappled provides a tractable genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has been difficult to study in higher organisms. Keywords: Hemocytes, dappled, Cytochrome b5, Melanotic tumors, Granulomas",
    "introduction": "Introduction Drosophila is well studied as a model of innate immunity in humans and has been instrumental in establishing principles of defense and gene signaling pathways that involve both immune induction and hematopoiesis (Lemaitre and Hoffmann 2007). The Drosophila Toll pathway mediates the response to microbial infections, and humans were subsequently found to have a family of Toll receptors that also respond to infections. Other shared immune signaling pathways are the Imd (immune deficiency)/TNF1 (tumor necrosis factor 1), JNK (Jun kinase), and JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-STAT transcription factor) pathways. Activation of NFkB transcription factors, which regulate target genes such as cytokines and antimicrobial proteins, is a key shared feature (Wang and Ligoxygakis 2006). Like the signaling pathways, the cell and tissue components of the Drosophila and human immune systems are analogous (Kimbrell and Beutler 2001). In Drosophila, the hemocytes and the fat body mediate, respectively, the major cellular and humoral arms of the response. Hemocytes participate in immune signaling to the fat body, phagocytosis, damaged tissue surveillance, encapsulation of foreign intruders, and remodeling of cells during development and also respond to aberrant self-cells to form melanotic tumors/pseudotumors (Babcock et al. 2008; Brennan et al. 2007; Gateff 1994; Rizki and Rizki 1983; Tepass et al. 1994; Vass and Nappi 2000). The fat body, like the mammalian liver, produces abundant humoral response molecules, including antimicrobial peptides released into the hemolymph (Aggrawal and Silverman 2007). Drosophila produces three types of hemocytes: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells (Crozatier and Meister 2007). Plasmatocytes account for ~95% of total blood cells and most functions. In particular, plasmatocytes are responsible for the phagocytosis of microorganisms during an infection and apoptotic cells during development. Lamellocytes are produced only in response to parasites or by mutations that produce melanotic tumors. Crystal cells constitute ~5% of total blood cells and are involved in melanization. As in vertebrates, Drosophila blood cells also have two developmental origins: one early in the embryonic head mesoderm and another during larval development in the lymph gland (Evans et al. 2003). Molecular cascades and factors regulating hematopoiesis are also shared with humans and involve many pathways, for example, Toll, JAK/STAT, Hedgehog, Notch, GATA, and Runx (Evans and Banerjee 2003; Mandal et al. 2007). A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is that of melanotic tumors or nodules. Melanotic nodules may be in the hemocoel or associated with the lymph glands and consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells that are covered by lamellocytes and melanized, similar to the immune response to a parasitic wasp egg (Luo et al. 1995; Meister and Lagueux 2003; Minakhina and Steward 2006b; Stofanko et al. 2008). Mutations in a variety of genes and genetic pathways have been found to produce this phenotype, such as JAK–STAT, which is also associated with blood cell overproliferation in humans, the Toll pathway, and Ras/MAPK (Asha et al. 2003; Li 2008; Minakhina and Steward 2006a; Zettervall et al. 2004). Some other genes with this mutant phenotype are air 8, encoding ribosomal protein s6 (Watson et al. 1992); black pearl, encoding a DnaJ homolog (Becker et al. 2001); l(3)malignant blood neoplasm, encoding a protein with human cytokeratin homology (Gateff 1994); yantar, encoding a conserved arginine-rich protein (Sinenko et al. 2004); and the Polycomb group gene multi sex combs (Remillieux-Leschelle et al. 2002). The melanotic tumor genes are an important category to identify and define in order to understand blood cell function and regulation. In a P-element enhancer detector screen concentrating on immune-related tissues and phenotypes, we identified the melanotic tumor gene dappled (dpld) (Rodriguez et al. 1996). Enhancer detector expression of dappled was high in the fat body, oenocytes, ring gland, and gut. Lethal and viable mutations of dappled produced melanotic tumors, and lethal mutation was also associated with aberrant tissue morphology, for example, of the fat body and gut (Rodriguez et al. 1996). A distinguishing feature of dappled mutants is consistent melanotic tumor formation, in contrast to other melanotic tumor mutants, which typically have low and variable rates. We now report identification of dappled as a member of the cytochrome b5 family. Cytochrome b5 is a conserved, ubiquitous, small hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways, such as fatty acid desaturation, cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions, sterol metabolism, and conversion of methemoglobin (Schenkman and Jansson 2003). Cytochrome b5 is thus involved in processes such as metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, maintenance of oxygen levels, and production of steroid hormones (Locuson et al. 2007; Miller 2005; Yamazaki and Shimada 2006). Cytochrome b5 genetics in higher organisms has not been very amenable to study, and dappled provides a new avenue of approach for study of cytochrome b5 functions. In this report, we characterize the dappled mutant hemocyte phenotype and present the potential to study cytochrome b5 function by screening for compounds that affect the dappled hemocyte phenotype.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Drosophila Stocks and Rearing Oregon R flies were used as the standard wild-type strain. The dappled mutants are the dpld MLB (97/16) and dpld EJL (142/2) strains of Rodriguez et al. (1996). Experiments were performed using dpld MLB/dpld EJL transheterozygotes or dpld mutants hemizygous with Df(2R)ST1 (Bloomington Stock Center). The hemese-Gal4 strain is that of Zettervall et al. (2004). The UAS-dappled transgenic strain was made using the cDNA clone RE66521 from the Bloomington Drosophila Genome Project, which matched our splice product for dappled mRNA (see below). The insert of plasmid RE66521 was isolated using the EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites, ligated into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pUAST vector using BamHI/XbaI linkers, and transgenic strains made by Genetic Services, Inc. Insertion strains of UAS-dappled into chromosomes X, 2, and 3 were recovered. All stocks were raised on the Bloomington Stock Center food recipe in a 25°C incubator. For the curcumin-raised flies, the food, before cooling, was supplemented with 20 mg/ml curcumin (Sigma), and parents were placed onto the food for mating and egg laying. Compare with Gupta et al. (2009), in which doses for mice were 5, 30, and 60 mg/kg orally, daily for 19 days, and note that at 100 mg/ml, flies had high lethality in addition to developmental delay. Molecular Genetic Analysis Genomic DNA fragments flanking the dappled 97/16 (k09716) and 142/2 (k14202) P-element insertion sites were recovered by the plasmid rescue technique (Wilson et al. 1989), sequenced (Davis Sequencing), and aligned to the genome (Blast). The PCR primers used to compare the 88/15 (k08815) strain P-element insertion sequences AQ034113 and AQ025871 (Tweedie et al. 2009) to wild-type sequences were TATCGTCGCTGTGCTTACAGAT (60, forward) and CTAAACCTCCAATTCGGCTATG (61, reverse) at the AQ034113 end and CTCCACGCGTAATATACCCATT (58, forward) and AGTCATGGATGCGTAGTCACAC (59, reverse) at the AQ025871 end. In order to confirm the 88/15 insertion site, PCR fragments that resulted from the P-element end primer RsyII (Tweedie et al. 2009) in combination with primers 59 and 60 were sequenced. The PCR primers used to test for possible alternative splicing of CG2140/dappled were sequences 55, 56, and 57 (Fig. 1). The sequence of the single transcript detected was translated to an amino acid sequence and placed into the cytochrome b5 family by Blast comparison. Clustal W was used to align the dappled cytochrome b5 sequence to selected other cytochrome b5 proteins. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab The dappled locus. a Four P-element insertions in dappled/CG2140 produce mutations with a melanotic tumor phenotype (k09716, k00107, k14202, and 01857). These four dappled insertions and the 03427 and 05643 insertions are included within the k08815 deletion. Insertions 03610 and 08492 are outside the dappled and k08815 regions. One dappled mRNA transcript has been detected, and it has one intron spanning from +120 to +1712 (dotted line). The numbers 55, 56, and 57 indicate the positions of PCR primers used to test for alternative mRNA splicing products; only the 55–57 pair produced a PCR product. Black bars indicate the dappled protein coding region. b Sequence of the dappled/CG2140 gene. The sequence of the PCR fragment obtained from primers 55 and 57 to total adult RNA was combined with the sequence data for CG2140 at Flybase (Tweedie et al. 2009). Transcribed sequence with 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR is shown in capital letters. The protein encoding sequence is underlined, with the ATG start site shaded gray, and the translated amino acid sequence is below the underline. Bold and italicized sequences indicate the primers 55, 56, and 57 Northern Blot Analysis Total RNA was isolated using the Totally RNA kit (Ambion), and poly-A RNA was isolated using the Oligotex Direct mRNA Purification kit (Qiagen). The RNA was run on formaldehyde gels and transferred overnight using Ambion Northern Max reagents. The dappled probe was 642 bp defined by the primers 55 and 57 (Fig. 1). This 642 bp PCR fragment was subcloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. After blue/white screening to select the colony, PCR and sequencing were used to confirm the insert and determine orientation. Transcription used T7 polymerase and 32P-labeled UTP and the Ambion Strip EZ kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. The rp49 probe was made using the primers TCCTTCCAGCTTCAAGATGACC (forward) and AGAAGTTCCTGGTGCACAACGT (reverse). Hybridization was overnight, and a Fuji phosphoimager and ImageJ were used to analyze the hybridization signal. Blood Cell Counts Third-instar larvae were developmentally staged as early versus late wandering phase based on retention in the gut of food dye (Zettervall et al. 2004). The Bright-Line Counting Chamber (Fisher) hemocytometer was used to count blood cells stained with monochlorobimane dye (Tirouvanziam et al. 2004) or GFP-expressing blood cells as in Zettervall et al. (2004), except that instead of red food color we used blue (Deep Blue Shade, Esco Foods, Inc.). Siblings that were heterozygous for dappled were distinguished based on either a CyO balancer with the marker y+ (i.e., y; +/dpld vs. y; +/CyO, y+) or B-galactosidase staining to indicate presence or absence of a dpld enhancer trap (Rodriguez et al. 1996). Separate counts of blood cells in y versus y+ larvae established that y did not affect the blood cell counts. Determination of sex was by the size of the gonads or by marking the sexes with y versus y+. Hemocyte counts from different samples were compared using the t test, and P values were calculated using VassarStats (http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html).",
    "results": "Results Cytochrome b5, the Encoded Product of dappled The original dappled alleles, dpld EJL and dpld MLB, result from the P-element insertions (P-lacW) in strains 142/2 (k14202) and 97/16 (k09716), respectively (Rodriguez et al. 1996). The dpld EJL allele is homozygous and hemizygous lethal, and dpld MLB is homozygous and hemizygous viable. Heteroallelic dpld EJL /dpld MLB is also viable and, like dpld EJL and dpld MLB homozygotes and hemizygotes, has melanotic tumors (Rodriguez et al. 1996). In order to identify the gene associated with the melanotic tumor phenotype, we molecularly cloned and sequenced the dappled gene. We used the technique of plasmid rescue to isolate the genomic DNA flanking the k14202 and k09716 insertions. Sequencing of the flanking DNA and alignment to the genome placed both insertions into the 5′ UTR of CG2140 (Tweedie et al. 2009), with k09716 46 bp farther upstream than k14202 (Fig. 1). In contrast to our results, genome annotation assigned dappled as CG1624 based on the position of the lethal P-element insertion 88/15 (k08815), which did not complement the 142/2 insertion (Spradling et al. 1999). We therefore investigated this discrepancy in the identification of dappled. The 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences for the k08815 insertion are 3′-AQ034113 and 5′-AQ025871. Alignment of these flanking sequences on the latest Drosophila genome sequence, however, places them 176,059 bp apart. There are several potential causes for this gap in the sequence: multiple insertions, an error in data reporting, or a large deletion. To test for the accuracy of the k08815 flanking sequence, primers were designed to (1) flank the 3′ and 5′ insertion sites of the k08815 transposon and (2) extend from a P-element end primer (pRsyII) into a flanking sequence. The resultant PCR fragments supported the published flanking sequences, as wild-type products were not observed in the mutant strain and both insertion sites were verified with the P-element end primer (Fig. 1). Finally, these PCR products were sequenced to provide confirmation of the flanking sequences. These results indicate that k08815 is not a simple insertion but is associated with additional disruption at its genomic position. We set out to differentiate between either multiple insertions or a large deletion by performing complementation tests with other lethal insertion strains in the region. Complementation tests confirmed that a large deletion accompanies the k08815 insertion (Fig. 1). Complementation and mapping also placed two more insertions, k00107 and 01857, into the 5′ UTR and intron of CG2140/dappled, respectively (Fig. 1). We tested these various dappled mutants for alterations in transcription, further confirming that the dappled phenotype results from an effect on CG2140, by performing Northern blot analysis using RNA from dappled mutants. This analysis showed a decrease in CG2140 transcript levels in the dappled mutants compared with the Oregon R controls (Fig. 2). The dappled strains are hypomorphic, with the lethal alleles stronger. The lethal allele dpld EJL expresses approximately 10% of wild-type embryonic RNA levels, whereas the viable allele dpld MLB has ~80% of wild-type adult RNA levels. Analysis of the transcripts by RT-PCR and sequencing showed one splice variant, with a single intron (Fig. 1). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab The dappled transcript levels are reduced in dappled mutants. Northern blot analysis of dappled transcripts shows reduced levels in mutants compared with wild type. Upper panels: Northern blots after probing with labeled dappled. Lower panels: control for loading of RNA in each lane by reprobing the blots with labeled rp49. a Adult total RNA from Oregon R (lane 1), dpld MLB/dpld EJL transheterozygotes (lane 2), and dpld MLB homozygotes (lane 3). b Embryonic total RNA from Oregon R (lane 1) and dpld 01857 homozygotes (lane 2); embryonic poly-A RNA from Oregon R (lane 4), and dpld EJL homozygotes (lane 5). Lane 3 contains no RNA. Embryos from the homozygous lethal strains dpld EJL and dpld 01857 were sorted via a Balancer chromosome expressing GFP (CyO, Kr-GFP), in order to select for the homozygous mutant embryos. Quantitation after correcting for loading using rp49 shows reduced levels of dappled RNA in all mutants. Compared with wild type, approximate levels are (a) 65% in lane 2 and 80% in lane 3; (b) 40% in lane 2 and 10% in lane 5 Based on sequence homology from our alignments and the Flybase Genome Annotation, Drosophila gene CG2140/dappled encodes a microsomal cytochrome b5 (Fig. 1; http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0033189.html). Genome annotation has identified CG2140 as the only cytochrome b5 in Drosophila. One related Drosophila sequence has been identified, cytochrome b5-related (Cyt-b5-r; http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000406.html). Cyt-b5-r has 436 residues (there are only 134 for Dappled and 135 for human cytochrome b5), and only 30 of the Cyt-b5-r residues are identical to the Dappled sequence. In a comparison of the dappled encoded amino acid sequence with a selection of other cytochrome b5 proteins from mammals and insects, Dappled has 45% identity with human cytochrome b5 and 76% identity with housefly cytochrome b5 (Fig. 3). Overall, the selected mammals and insects have 32% identity. Cytochrome b5 is a highly conserved, ubiquitous family of small hemoproteins that participate in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions. These reactions are involved in many biological processes, such as conversion of methemoglobin, sterol metabolism, fatty acid desaturation, and cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions (Schenkman and Jansson 2003). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Cytochrome b5 sequences. The sequences of Dappled and selected other cytochrome b5 proteins from insects and mammals are compared using Clustal W for alignment and consensus generation (Prim. Cons.). See Wang et al. (2007) for an X-ray crystal structure comparison of the heme binding domain, residues 6–95. Note the high sequence identity within this region, which is 82% for residues 40–73. Sequence accession numbers are Rattus norvegicus GenBank AAB67610.1; Mus musculus Swiss-Prot P56395.2; Sus scrofa Swiss-Prot P00172.3, Homo sapiens GenBank AAA35729.1; Drosophila dappled GenBank HQ864711; Musca domestica GenBank AAA56985.1; Anopheles gambiae GenBank AAO24766.1 Hemocyte Misregulation and Melanotic Nodule Formation in dappled Mutants The dpld MLB insertion has made analysis possible, as in addition to producing consistent melanotic tumor formation, it is the only viable allele. Maintenance of dpld MLB homozygotes as a stock, however, was not feasible because of effects on fertility. Homozygous dpld MLB or transheterozygous dpld MLB/dpld EJL females and males produced few progeny, even when mated with wild-type flies (<5 progeny/dappled parent), and mutant females laid few eggs (~50/female). It is unlikely that this fertility problem is due simply to physical obstruction in the abdomen, because flies with less obtrusive tumors (i.e., small tumors near the thorax) also show low fertility. To avoid the effects of accumulation of second site mutations by maintaining the dpld MLB chromosome over a balancer, all experiments were done on progeny from crosses that produced transheterozygotes or hemizygotes. The development of the Gal4–UAS system (Brand and Perrimon 1993) to include drivers for the hematopoietic system makes it more feasible to be able to investigate the blood cell phenotypes of mutant genes, for example, Kimbrell et al. (2002) and Zettervall et al. (2004). The hemese-Gal4 construct drives expression in blood cells of the plasmatocyte and lamellocyte classes (Zettervall et al. 2004). Strains with hemese-Gal4 UAS-GFP thus have the blood cells marked with GFP, enabling hemocyte counting and phenotype analysis in various genetic strains (Zettervall et al. 2004). We used hemese-Gal4 UAS-GFP to investigate the blood cells of dappled melanotic tumor mutants. In melanotic tumors of dpld EJL /dpld MLB; hemese-Gal4 UAS-GFP larvae, all of the cells in the masses were found to fluoresce strongly for GFP (Fig. 4). Cell counts of circulating plasmatocytes and lamellocytes showed large numbers of circulating lamellocytes (Fig. 4). Lamellocytes are not found in normal, healthy larvae, whereas in melanotic nodule mutants lamellocytes are abundant (Crozatier and Meister 2007). The dappled melanotic tumors are thus specifically designated as melanotic nodules, which consist of hemocytes, as opposed to melanizations, which are non-blood cell tissues that have melanized (Minakhina and Steward 2006b). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Hemocytes of dappled viable mutants. a Hemocytes visualized by GFP expression show (left) melanotic tumors/nodules in a third-instar larva as clumps of hemocytes that are partially melanized, along with circulating plasmatocytes, and (right), at higher magnification, lamellocytes. Lamellocytes are approximately four times larger than plasmatocytes. GFP expression is driven by the hemese-Gal4 driver. b Cell counts of circulating hemocytes in early and late wandering third-instar larvae show high levels of lamellocytes and characterize the dynamic process of melanotic tumor formation by comparing mutants with small (left bars) versus large (right bars) melanotic nodules. Error bars show 0.95 confidence limits. N ≥ 15 for each category. (Color figure online)Mutant dappled larvae were categorized based on the relative size of the melanotic nodules. Larvae with small versus large melanotic nodules showed different numbers of circulating plasmatocytes and lamellocytes (Fig. 4). Notably, lamellocytes are more prevalent in small tumors, whereas plasmatocytes are more abundant in large nodules. One possible interpretation of the higher number of lamellocytes in smaller nodules is that these nodules are still actively forming, and lamellocytes are still being recruited to the nodules. During normal larval development, the number of plasmatocytes typically increases two- to threefold from the early wandering (early) to the late wandering (late) stage of the third instar (Crozatier and Meister 2007; Zettervall et al. 2004). Plasmatocyte representation from early to late stage wandering was different for small and large tumors. Larvae with large tumors showed an increase from early to late stage, whereas larvae with small tumors did not (Fig. 4), and this may also reflect the dynamic nature of dappled melanotic nodule formation. Heterozygosity of dappled does not produce tumors, but it does have a dominant effect on blood cell number. The dappled heterozygotes (Bal/dpld) have a significantly higher number of plasmatocytes than wild-type larvae (+/+). This difference was confirmed by counting hemocytes of dappled heterozygotes (dpld/+) and their control siblings (Bal/+) (Fig. 5). Further, counts of siblings showed that the increase in plasmatocytes is present both early and late in the third instar. The relative numbers of lamellocytes in dappled heterozygotes is less clear, as the average was very low, many larvae had no lamellocytes, and the number did not increase from early to late stage (Fig. 5). Thus, although the lamellocyte data are statistically significant (P < 0.05), dappled heterozygosity at most yields a very weak induction of lamellocyte differentiation. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Plasmatocytes and lamellocytes are increased in dappled heterozygotes. a Cell counts of plasmatocytes during late third instar of dappled heterozygotes, over a Balancer (Bal) or wild-type (+) chromosome, show significantly more plasmatocytes than wild-type (+/+) and Balancer (Bal/+) controls. Counts were normalized across three experiments to the percentage of controls. The average for control +/+ was 5,697 cells/larva and Bal/+ was 4,935 cells/larva. P < 0.01 for dpld/+ versus Bal/+, and P < 0.05 for Bal/dpld versus +/+. b Cell counts of plasmatocytes of dappled heterozygotes and controls that are siblings show that the increase in plasmatocytes has already occurred by early wandering third instar. Additionally, dappled heterozygotes show a normal increase, which is approximately two- to threefold, in plasmatocyte number from early to late stage. Counts were normalized across three experiments to the percentage of control Bal/+ late, which averaged 4,125 cells/larva. P < 0.01 for both early and late of dpld/+ versus Bal/+. c Cell counts of the larvae (b) show that lamellocytes are also increased. Control Bal/+ larvae had no lamellocytes in any sample. P < 0.05 for both early and late dpld/+ versus Bal/+. The average number of cells in early dappled heterozygotes was 5, with high variability and no significant difference from late dappled heterozygotes (P > 0.05). N ≥ 15 per genotype for each experiment Rescue of Hemocyte Phenotype but Not Lethality by Wild-Type dappled in Blood Cells We next asked if the dappled phenotype could be rescued by expressing wild-type dappled only in blood cells. We constructed a plasmid containing UAS-dpld, which was used to make transgenic strains with UAS-dpld in different chromosomal locations. The hemese-Gal4 was then used to drive UAS-dpld, and the rates of melanotic nodule formation were compared in dappled mutants and controls. In addition to hemocytes, hemese-Gal4 drives strong expression in the salivary glands, so a control salivary gland driver, sgs3-Gal4, was also used to drive UAS-dpld. To test for rescue of lethality by ubiquitous expression, the da-Gal4 driver (Pili-Floury et al. 2004) was used. The dappled mutants with hemese-Gal4, but not sgs3-Gal4, driving UAS-dpld are rescued from the melanotic phenotype. Three different UAS-dpld insertions were tested with hemese-Gal4, and all showed similar rates of rescue (Table 1). Dissections were performed to determine if blood cell nodules might be forming but not melanizing. The dissections confirmed that blood cell nodule formation without accompanying melanization did not occur. Table 1.

Two thirds of the progeny are expected to be in this category c dpld transheterozygotes with Gal4 or UAS d dpld transheterozygotes with both Gal4 and UAS eResults with all three UAS-dpld lines The dominant effect of heterozygous dappled on plasmatocyte number is also rescued by adding dappled expression to blood cells. Hemocyte counts of dappled heterozygotes with hemese-Gal4 driving UAS-dpld had, on average, reduced numbers of hemocytes, compared with control dappled heterozygotes (Fig. 6). The number of lamellocytes in heterozygotes was also reduced on average, but with the small number and variability in lamellocytes, was not significantly different (Fig. 6). These results do not necessarily rule out other tissues as important for the dappled mutant blood cell phenotypes, but rather emphasize that the level of dappled expression in the blood cells regulates number and differentiation. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Rescue of dappled heterozygote phenotype by expression of wild-type dappled in hemocytes. The dappled heterozygotes with UAS-dpld driven by hemese-Gal4 (Bal/dpld UAS-dpld) were compared with controls without UAS and Gal4 (Bal/dpld and Bal/+). Counts were normalized across three experiments to the percentage of Bal/dpld. Plasmatocyte counts (a) are significantly reduced in rescued larvae compared with Bal/dpld (P < 0.05), but not compared with Bal/+ (P > 0.05). Lamellocyte counts (b) are reduced on average in rescued larvae, but not to a significant extent (P > 0.05, compared with both Bal/dpld and Bal/+). N ≥ 15 per genotype for each experimentExpression of wild-type dappled in blood cells did not rescue the mutant lethality. In contrast, ubiquitous expression of wild-type dappled completely rescued the mutant lethality, producing normal adults with no tumors (Table 2). These results are consistent with the aberrant tissue morphology of lethal dappled (Rodriguez et al. 1996) and establish the importance of dappled transcript levels for normal function in other tissues.

As noted above, plasmatocytes in dappled tumors express the hemese-Gal4 driver, which does not express in the lymph glands, further indicating an early developmental origin for these cells. Additionally, the lymph glands appear normal, at least at a gross level, and only one dappled enhancer trap expresses in the lymph glands (Rodriguez et al. 1996). We analyzed 1 kb of the dappled upstream region for potential binding by blood cell, lymph gland, and other transcription factors using the Transfac database (Wingender 2008) provided by Biobase Biological Databases (http://www.biobase-international.com/index.php?id=home).

Cells of the two waves were differentiated by (1) using hemese-Gal4 to drive UAS-GFP in cells from the first wave of development, so that first-wave cells fluoresced green, and (2) staining all hemocytes with monochlorobimane dye, so that the second-wave hemocytes fluoresced blue but not green. The developmental stage selected to have both sets of hemocytes was white prepupae, age 0–3 h postformation as white prepupae. These results show that heterozygosity of dappled increases the number of plasmatocytes from both hematopoietic waves (Table 4). Table 4.

Similar numbers of the sexes are needed per sample, however, as the sexes differ in the number of hemocytes. For the experiment depicted in Table 4, we separated the sexes in order to demonstrate this finding and test for a sex difference in the second hematopoietic wave as well. The results are that in both wild type and dappled there is a significant difference between males and females in the number of hemocytes for both hematopoietic waves. Curcumin Enhancement of the dappled Melanotic Phenotype Cytochrome b5 is widely studied for its effects on drug metabolism, and conversely, various drugs are investigated for alteration of cytochrome b5 levels (El-Lakkany et al. 2004; Juvonen et al. 1992; Portoles et al. 1989; Schenkman and Jansson 1999; Sheweita 2004; Yamaori et al. 2003; Yamazaki et al. 2002). We hypothesized that modulation of the dappled phenotype could be used as an in vivo assay for cytochrome b5 related effects of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. We are therefore screening compounds with a known connection to cytochrome P450s and/or anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties for enhancement or suppression of the dappled melanotic phenotype. Initial studies with aspirin and the corticosteroid dexamethasone are negative (data not shown), whereas curcumin, the active ingredient in the spice turmeric, has consistently shown an enhancement of the melanotic phenotype (Table 5; Fig. 7). Adult dappled mutants that have been raised (egg to adult) on curcumin-supplemented food have an enhanced melanotic phenotype, showing more and/or larger melanotic tumors (Table 5). The enhanced phenotype of the dappled mutants is already evident in the larval stages (Fig. 7). Adult dappled heterozygotes, however, do not develop a melanotic phenotype when raised on curcumin (Table 5). Since both the heterozygotes and heteroallelic mutants have some reduction in dappled transcript levels, the effects of curcumin may depend on the exact amount of cytochrome b5 protein that is produced.

    "discussion": "Discussion We have identified dappled as a member of the conserved, ubiquitous cytochrome b5 family. The complexities of cytochrome b5 function, through its participation in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions, are reflected in the difficulties and limited study of its genetics in higher organisms. Characterizations in humans have shown that cytochrome b5 mutation causes methemoglobinemia, which interferes with the balance between hemoglobin and methemoglobin, thus affecting oxygenation and inflammation (Hegesh et al. 1986; Umbreit 2007). Mutation of cytochrome b5 reductase also causes methemoglobinemia and is more common (Davis et al. 2004). In addition, one case of cytochrome b5 methemoglobinemia may also have been associated with hormonal defects (Giordano et al. 1994). With the exception of a porcine mutation associated with an altered androstenone level (Lin et al. 2005), cytochrome b5 mutations in other organisms have not been identified. In mice, cytochrome b5 deletion is also lethal, but experiments with a tissue-specific knockout have allowed liver function to be addressed (Finn et al. 2008). With our studies of dappled, Drosophila now provides a tractable genetic model for the study of cytochrome b5 in blood cells and other tissues. Hemocytes are particularly sensitive to mutation of dappled and show that cytochrome b5 functions to produce normal differentiation and numbers of hemocytes. Mutation of one copy of dappled results in a significant increase in the number of circulating hemocytes, and mutation of both copies results in the formation of melanotic nodules. The formation of dappled melanotic nodules is a Class 2 reaction in the classification of Watson et al. (1991), in which Class 2 represents alteration of immune cells and Class 1 represents normal immune cells responding to other cell types that are aberrant. The dominant effect on blood cell number emphasizes that wild-type levels of cytochrome b5 are needed for full normal functions. In humans, levels of cytochrome b5 have been implicated as important with respect to xenobiotic metabolism and health. Kurian et al. (2007) hypothesized that functionally significant genetic variability in cytochrome b5 occurs in individuals without clinical symptoms. They investigated processing of hydroxylamines, which are oxidative products of arylamine drugs and environmental carcinogens, by the mutant cytochrome b5 of one heterozygous individual and found, in vitro, altered affinity for hydroxylamine substrates and dramatically reduced cytochrome b5 expression (Kurian et al. 2007). Expression of wild-type dappled in hemocytes rescued both the increase in blood cell number and the formation of melanotic nodules. The driver used was hemese-Gal4, which is active in circulating plasmatocytes and sessile hemocytes, but not the lymph glands (Markus et al. 2009; Zettervall et al. 2004). Interestingly, the sessile hemocytes are a newly discovered hematopoietic site and appear to be the main developmental origin of lamellocytes (Markus et al. 2009). This site of expression may be the key factor in rescuing the dappled melanotic nodule phenotype. Rescue of the plasmatocyte increase in dappled heterozygotes is expected to result from the hemese-Gal4 expression in circulating blood cells of the first hematopoietic wave, both because of the age of the larvae (prerelease of lymph gland cells) and because hemese-Gal4 does not express in lymph glands. However, dappled also increased the number of hemocytes from the second hematopoietic wave. Hemocytes from both developmental origins, embryonic and lymph gland, require dappled in order to be produced in normal amounts. It is an interesting question as to whether the plasmatocyte increase in dappled mutants can be independently controlled in the first and second hematopoietic waves. Does the increase in plasmatocytes indicate overproliferation or less apoptosis? Since dappled encodes a cytochrome b5, the obvious choice would be apoptosis rather than overproliferation. There are two problems with this choice: it is mitochondrial cytochrome b5 that is established in the canonical cytochrome C signaling apoptotic pathway, and the use of that pathway by Drosophila is controversial (Kornbluth and White 2005; Means and Hays 2007; Oberst et al. 2008; Ow et al. 2008). Microsomal cytochrome b5, however, has also been suggested to be involved in cytochrome C mediated apoptosis (Davydov 2001), and Drosophila may have its own version of apoptotic signaling that uses the dappled cytochrome b5. Further, blood cells are well described for their role in response to apoptotic cells, but the role of their own apoptosis in development and infection is not clear (Bruckner et al. 2004; Crozatier and Meister 2007; Lemaitre and Hoffmann 2007). The sensitivity of hemocytes (compared with other cell types) to dappled mutation may result from blood cell mitotic cell division continuing during development (Crozatier and Meister 2007). There are many potential mechanisms for dappled to affect overproliferation, especially given the increasingly complex functions of plasmatocytes (Charroux and Royet 2009). One option consistent with cytochrome b5 function, and potentially the dappled effects on fertility, is that hormonal signaling of hematopoiesis is affected. In that case, however, rescue of the dappled blood cell phenotype would be predicted by adding back wild-type dappled expression in the steroid-producing ring gland (Gilbert 2004) rather than hemocytes. Alternatively, dappled expression could rescue a steroid-processing step in the hemocytes. An intriguing option is that cytochrome b5 has a new, previously unidentified role in blood cell signaling pathways, for example, through JAK/Stat or JNK. More specifically, a candidate to mediate the effects of dappled is TNF-receptor associated factor 6 (Traf6), which is predicted from protein studies to interact with cytochrome b5 (Drosophila Interactions Database, http://www.droidb.org). Among its activities, Traf6 is an upstream activator of nuclear factor-kappaB, and mutants are immune response defective (Cha et al. 2003; Wu and Arron 2003). Cytochrome b5 involvement with Traf6 is a testable hypothesis through analysis of genetic interaction between dappled and Traf6 mutants. Our results with curcumin demonstrate that screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds for effects on the dappled phenotypes can be done as an in vivo approach for analysis of cytochrome b5. Curcumin is widely studied for its potential as a nutritional pharmaceutical (Duvoix et al. 2005; Jagetia and Aggarwal 2007). Among its many activities, which are mainly anti-inflammatory and anticancer, curcumin inhibits cytochrome P450s, down-regulates NFkB, and affects apoptosis and the cell cycle (Alpers 2008; Appiah-Opong et al. 2007; Kwon et al. 2007; Sa and Das 2008). Curcumin enhanced the melanotic phenotype of dappled mutants. This effect of curcumin is consistent with NFkB involvement, but there are other alternatives, in particular, cytochrome P450 processing in the fat body. Mutation of dappled showed similar effects in females and males, but an unexpected consequence of our studies is the finding that females and males differ significantly in the number of circulating blood cells. In humans, a difference between the sexes in the numbers of blood cell types is well established, but the effects are unclear (Blum and Pabst 2007; Huppert et al. 1998; Reichert et al. 1991). In both humans and Drosophila, there are differences in the immune responses between the sexes that affect health (Dale et al. 2006; Marriott and Huet-Hudson 2006; Shames 2002; Taylor and Kimbrell 2007; Ye et al. 2009; Zandman-Goddard et al. 2007), and the blood cell number differential may be part of mediating the immune response differences. Recently, Drosophila hemocytes have been shown to directly signal immune induction of the fat body, and a reduced number of hemocytes resulted in less immune induction (Shia et al. 2009). In Drosophila, the increase in hemocytes of dappled and females may result in higher immune induction, which may or may not provide a healthier condition. For example, human females typically have a more robust immune response but also a higher incidence of autoimmune disorders (Dale et al. 2006; Zandman-Goddard et al. 2007). Cytochrome b5 expression is critical for survival, and its importance to hemocytes and additional tissues is emphasized by the finding that ubiquitous, but not hemocyte, expression of wild-type dappled rescued lethality. The functions of cytochrome b5 are open for testing in a wide range of tissue types using dappled. In all respects, genetic interaction and drug screens for suppressors and enhancers of dappled will be useful ways to discern the many roles of cytochrome b5 function.",

Copyright notice ID: 3092937 PMID: 21279680 Abstract A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is melanotic tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells, similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Viable mutations of dappled cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte misregulation during both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are similarly affected, but hemocyte number is different in females and males of both mutants and wild type. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the dappled melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. Overall, dappled provides a tractable genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has been difficult to study in higher organisms. Keywords: Hemocytes, dappled, Cytochrome b5, Melanotic tumors, GranulomasIntroduction Drosophila is well studied as a model of innate immunity in humans and has been instrumental in establishing principles of defense and gene signaling pathways that involve both immune induction and hematopoiesis (Lemaitre and Hoffmann 2007). The Drosophila Toll pathway mediates the response to microbial infections, and humans were subsequently found to have a family of Toll receptors that also respond to infections. Other shared immune signaling pathways are the Imd (immune deficiency)/TNF1 (tumor necrosis factor 1), JNK (Jun kinase), and JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-STAT transcription factor) pathways. Activation of NFkB transcription factors, which regulate target genes such as cytokines and antimicrobial proteins, is a key shared feature (Wang and Ligoxygakis 2006). Like the signaling pathways, the cell and tissue components of the Drosophila and human immune systems are analogous (Kimbrell and Beutler 2001). In Drosophila, the hemocytes and the fat body mediate, respectively, the major cellular and humoral arms of the response. Hemocytes participate in immune signaling to the fat body, phagocytosis, damaged tissue surveillance, encapsulation of foreign intruders, and remodeling of cells during development and also respond to aberrant self-cells to form melanotic tumors/pseudotumors (Babcock et al. 2008; Brennan et al. 2007; Gateff 1994; Rizki and Rizki 1983; Tepass et al. 1994; Vass and Nappi 2000). The fat body, like the mammalian liver, produces abundant humoral response molecules, including antimicrobial peptides released into the hemolymph (Aggrawal and Silverman 2007). Drosophila produces three types of hemocytes: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells (Crozatier and Meister 2007). Plasmatocytes account for ~95% of total blood cells and most functions. In particular, plasmatocytes are responsible for the phagocytosis of microorganisms during an infection and apoptotic cells during development. Lamellocytes are produced only in response to parasites or by mutations that produce melanotic tumors. Crystal cells constitute ~5% of total blood cells and are involved in melanization. As in vertebrates, Drosophila blood cells also have two developmental origins: one early in the embryonic head mesoderm and another during larval development in the lymph gland (Evans et al. 2003). Molecular cascades and factors regulating hematopoiesis are also shared with humans and involve many pathways, for example, Toll, JAK/STAT, Hedgehog, Notch, GATA, and Runx (Evans and Banerjee 2003; Mandal et al. 2007). A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is that of melanotic tumors or nodules. Melanotic nodules may be in the hemocoel or associated with the lymph glands and consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells that are covered by lamellocytes and melanized, similar to the immune response to a parasitic wasp egg (Luo et al. 1995; Meister and Lagueux 2003; Minakhina and Steward 2006b; Stofanko et al. 2008). Mutations in a variety of genes and genetic pathways have been found to produce this phenotype, such as JAK–STAT, which is also associated with blood cell overproliferation in humans, the Toll pathway, and Ras/MAPK (Asha et al. 2003; Li 2008; Minakhina and Steward 2006a; Zettervall et al. 2004). Some other genes with this mutant phenotype are air 8, encoding ribosomal protein s6 (Watson et al. 1992); black pearl, encoding a DnaJ homolog (Becker et al. 2001); l(3)malignant blood neoplasm, encoding a protein with human cytokeratin homology (Gateff 1994); yantar, encoding a conserved arginine-rich protein (Sinenko et al. 2004); and the Polycomb group gene multi sex combs (Remillieux-Leschelle et al. 2002). The melanotic tumor genes are an important category to identify and define in order to understand blood cell function and regulation. In a P-element enhancer detector screen concentrating on immune-related tissues and phenotypes, we identified the melanotic tumor gene dappled (dpld) (Rodriguez et al. 1996). Enhancer detector expression of dappled was high in the fat body, oenocytes, ring gland, and gut. Lethal and viable mutations of dappled produced melanotic tumors, and lethal mutation was also associated with aberrant tissue morphology, for example, of the fat body and gut (Rodriguez et al. 1996). A distinguishing feature of dappled mutants is consistent melanotic tumor formation, in contrast to other melanotic tumor mutants, which typically have low and variable rates. We now report identification of dappled as a member of the cytochrome b5 family. Cytochrome b5 is a conserved, ubiquitous, small hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways, such as fatty acid desaturation, cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions, sterol metabolism, and conversion of methemoglobin (Schenkman and Jansson 2003). Cytochrome b5 is thus involved in processes such as metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, maintenance of oxygen levels, and production of steroid hormones (Locuson et al. 2007; Miller 2005; Yamazaki and Shimada 2006). Cytochrome b5 genetics in higher organisms has not been very amenable to study, and dappled provides a new avenue of approach for study of cytochrome b5 functions. In this report, we characterize the dappled mutant hemocyte phenotype and present the potential to study cytochrome b5 function by screening for compounds that affect the dappled hemocyte phenotype.Materials and Methods Drosophila Stocks and Rearing Oregon R flies were used as the standard wild-type strain. The dappled mutants are the dpld MLB (97/16) and dpld EJL (142/2) strains of Rodriguez et al. (1996). Experiments were performed using dpld MLB/dpld EJL transheterozygotes or dpld mutants hemizygous with Df(2R)ST1 (Bloomington Stock Center). The hemese-Gal4 strain is that of Zettervall et al. (2004). The UAS-dappled transgenic strain was made using the cDNA clone RE66521 from the Bloomington Drosophila Genome Project, which matched our splice product for dappled mRNA (see below). The insert of plasmid RE66521 was isolated using the EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites, ligated into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pUAST vector using BamHI/XbaI linkers, and transgenic strains made by Genetic Services, Inc. Insertion strains of UAS-dappled into chromosomes X, 2, and 3 were recovered. All stocks were raised on the Bloomington Stock Center food recipe in a 25°C incubator. For the curcumin-raised flies, the food, before cooling, was supplemented with 20 mg/ml curcumin (Sigma), and parents were placed onto the food for mating and egg laying. Compare with Gupta et al. (2009), in which doses for mice were 5, 30, and 60 mg/kg orally, daily for 19 days, and note that at 100 mg/ml, flies had high lethality in addition to developmental delay.Molecular Genetic Analysis Genomic DNA fragments flanking the dappled 97/16 (k09716) and 142/2 (k14202) P-element insertion sites were recovered by the plasmid rescue technique (Wilson et al. 1989), sequenced (Davis Sequencing), and aligned to the genome (Blast). The PCR primers used to compare the 88/15 (k08815) strain P-element insertion sequences AQ034113 and AQ025871 (Tweedie et al. 2009) to wild-type sequences were TATCGTCGCTGTGCTTACAGAT (60, forward) and CTAAACCTCCAATTCGGCTATG (61, reverse) at the AQ034113 end and CTCCACGCGTAATATACCCATT (58, forward) and AGTCATGGATGCGTAGTCACAC (59, reverse) at the AQ025871 end. In order to confirm the 88/15 insertion site, PCR fragments that resulted from the P-element end primer RsyII (Tweedie et al. 2009) in combination with primers 59 and 60 were sequenced. The PCR primers used to test for possible alternative splicing of CG2140/dappled were sequences 55, 56, and 57 (Fig. 1). The sequence of the single transcript detected was translated to an amino acid sequence and placed into the cytochrome b5 family by Blast comparison. Clustal W was used to align the dappled cytochrome b5 sequence to selected other cytochrome b5 proteins. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab The dappled locus. a Four P-element insertions in dappled/CG2140 produce mutations with a melanotic tumor phenotype (k09716, k00107, k14202, and 01857). These four dappled insertions and the 03427 and 05643 insertions are included within the k08815 deletion. Insertions 03610 and 08492 are outside the dappled and k08815 regions. One dappled mRNA transcript has been detected, and it has one intron spanning from +120 to +1712 (dotted line). The numbers 55, 56, and 57 indicate the positions of PCR primers used to test for alternative mRNA splicing products; only the 55–57 pair produced a PCR product. Black bars indicate the dappled protein coding region. b Sequence of the dappled/CG2140 gene. The sequence of the PCR fragment obtained from primers 55 and 57 to total adult RNA was combined with the sequence data for CG2140 at Flybase (Tweedie et al. 2009). Transcribed sequence with 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR is shown in capital letters. The protein encoding sequence is underlined, with the ATG start site shaded gray, and the translated amino acid sequence is below the underline. Bold and italicized sequences indicate the primers 55, 56, and 57Northern Blot Analysis Total RNA was isolated using the Totally RNA kit (Ambion), and poly-A RNA was isolated using the Oligotex Direct mRNA Purification kit (Qiagen). The RNA was run on formaldehyde gels and transferred overnight using Ambion Northern Max reagents. The dappled probe was 642 bp defined by the primers 55 and 57 (Fig. 1). This 642 bp PCR fragment was subcloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. After blue/white screening to select the colony, PCR and sequencing were used to confirm the insert and determine orientation. Transcription used T7 polymerase and 32P-labeled UTP and the Ambion Strip EZ kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. The rp49 probe was made using the primers TCCTTCCAGCTTCAAGATGACC (forward) and AGAAGTTCCTGGTGCACAACGT (reverse). Hybridization was overnight, and a Fuji phosphoimager and ImageJ were used to analyze the hybridization signal.Blood Cell Counts Third-instar larvae were developmentally staged as early versus late wandering phase based on retention in the gut of food dye (Zettervall et al. 2004). The Bright-Line Counting Chamber (Fisher) hemocytometer was used to count blood cells stained with monochlorobimane dye (Tirouvanziam et al. 2004) or GFP-expressing blood cells as in Zettervall et al. (2004), except that instead of red food color we used blue (Deep Blue Shade, Esco Foods, Inc.). Siblings that were heterozygous for dappled were distinguished based on either a CyO balancer with the marker y+ (i.e., y; +/dpld vs. y; +/CyO, y+) or B-galactosidase staining to indicate presence or absence of a dpld enhancer trap (Rodriguez et al. 1996). Separate counts of blood cells in y versus y+ larvae established that y did not affect the blood cell counts. Determination of sex was by the size of the gonads or by marking the sexes with y versus y+. Hemocyte counts from different samples were compared using the t test, and P values were calculated using VassarStats (http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html).Results Cytochrome b5, the Encoded Product of dappled The original dappled alleles, dpld EJL and dpld MLB, result from the P-element insertions (P-lacW) in strains 142/2 (k14202) and 97/16 (k09716), respectively (Rodriguez et al. 1996). The dpld EJL allele is homozygous and hemizygous lethal, and dpld MLB is homozygous and hemizygous viable. Heteroallelic dpld EJL /dpld MLB is also viable and, like dpld EJL and dpld MLB homozygotes and hemizygotes, has melanotic tumors (Rodriguez et al. 1996). In order to identify the gene associated with the melanotic tumor phenotype, we molecularly cloned and sequenced the dappled gene. We used the technique of plasmid rescue to isolate the genomic DNA flanking the k14202 and k09716 insertions. Sequencing of the flanking DNA and alignment to the genome placed both insertions into the 5′ UTR of CG2140 (Tweedie et al. 2009), with k09716 46 bp farther upstream than k14202 (Fig. 1). In contrast to our results, genome annotation assigned dappled as CG1624 based on the position of the lethal P-element insertion 88/15 (k08815), which did not complement the 142/2 insertion (Spradling et al. 1999). We therefore investigated this discrepancy in the identification of dappled. The 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences for the k08815 insertion are 3′-AQ034113 and 5′-AQ025871. Alignment of these flanking sequences on the latest Drosophila genome sequence, however, places them 176,059 bp apart. There are several potential causes for this gap in the sequence: multiple insertions, an error in data reporting, or a large deletion. To test for the accuracy of the k08815 flanking sequence, primers were designed to (1) flank the 3′ and 5′ insertion sites of the k08815 transposon and (2) extend from a P-element end primer (pRsyII) into a flanking sequence. The resultant PCR fragments supported the published flanking sequences, as wild-type products were not observed in the mutant strain and both insertion sites were verified with the P-element end primer (Fig. 1). Finally, these PCR products were sequenced to provide confirmation of the flanking sequences. These results indicate that k08815 is not a simple insertion but is associated with additional disruption at its genomic position. We set out to differentiate between either multiple insertions or a large deletion by performing complementation tests with other lethal insertion strains in the region. Complementation tests confirmed that a large deletion accompanies the k08815 insertion (Fig. 1). Complementation and mapping also placed two more insertions, k00107 and 01857, into the 5′ UTR and intron of CG2140/dappled, respectively (Fig. 1). We tested these various dappled mutants for alterations in transcription, further confirming that the dappled phenotype results from an effect on CG2140, by performing Northern blot analysis using RNA from dappled mutants. This analysis showed a decrease in CG2140 transcript levels in the dappled mutants compared with the Oregon R controls (Fig. 2). The dappled strains are hypomorphic, with the lethal alleles stronger. The lethal allele dpld EJL expresses approximately 10% of wild-type embryonic RNA levels, whereas the viable allele dpld MLB has ~80% of wild-type adult RNA levels. Analysis of the transcripts by RT-PCR and sequencing showed one splice variant, with a single intron (Fig. 1). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab The dappled transcript levels are reduced in dappled mutants. Northern blot analysis of dappled transcripts shows reduced levels in mutants compared with wild type. Upper panels: Northern blots after probing with labeled dappled. Lower panels: control for loading of RNA in each lane by reprobing the blots with labeled rp49. a Adult total RNA from Oregon R (lane 1), dpld MLB/dpld EJL transheterozygotes (lane 2), and dpld MLB homozygotes (lane 3). b Embryonic total RNA from Oregon R (lane 1) and dpld 01857 homozygotes (lane 2); embryonic poly-A RNA from Oregon R (lane 4), and dpld EJL homozygotes (lane 5). Lane 3 contains no RNA. Embryos from the homozygous lethal strains dpld EJL and dpld 01857 were sorted via a Balancer chromosome expressing GFP (CyO, Kr-GFP), in order to select for the homozygous mutant embryos. Quantitation after correcting for loading using rp49 shows reduced levels of dappled RNA in all mutants. Compared with wild type, approximate levels are (a) 65% in lane 2 and 80% in lane 3; (b) 40% in lane 2 and 10% in lane 5 Based on sequence homology from our alignments and the Flybase Genome Annotation, Drosophila gene CG2140/dappled encodes a microsomal cytochrome b5 (Fig. 1; http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0033189.html). Genome annotation has identified CG2140 as the only cytochrome b5 in Drosophila. One related Drosophila sequence has been identified, cytochrome b5-related (Cyt-b5-r; http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000406.html). Cyt-b5-r has 436 residues (there are only 134 for Dappled and 135 for human cytochrome b5), and only 30 of the Cyt-b5-r residues are identical to the Dappled sequence. In a comparison of the dappled encoded amino acid sequence with a selection of other cytochrome b5 proteins from mammals and insects, Dappled has 45% identity with human cytochrome b5 and 76% identity with housefly cytochrome b5 (Fig. 3). Overall, the selected mammals and insects have 32% identity. Cytochrome b5 is a highly conserved, ubiquitous family of small hemoproteins that participate in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions. These reactions are involved in many biological processes, such as conversion of methemoglobin, sterol metabolism, fatty acid desaturation, and cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions (Schenkman and Jansson 2003). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Cytochrome b5 sequences. The sequences of Dappled and selected other cytochrome b5 proteins from insects and mammals are compared using Clustal W for alignment and consensus generation (Prim. Cons.). See Wang et al. (2007) for an X-ray crystal structure comparison of the heme binding domain, residues 6–95. Note the high sequence identity within this region, which is 82% for residues 40–73.

Maintenance of dpld MLB homozygotes as a stock, however, was not feasible because of effects on fertility. Homozygous dpld MLB or transheterozygous dpld MLB/dpld EJL females and males produced few progeny, even when mated with wild-type flies (<5 progeny/dappled parent), and mutant females laid few eggs (~50/female). It is unlikely that this fertility problem is due simply to physical obstruction in the abdomen, because flies with less obtrusive tumors (i.e., small tumors near the thorax) also show low fertility. To avoid the effects of accumulation of second site mutations by maintaining the dpld MLB chromosome over a balancer, all experiments were done on progeny from crosses that produced transheterozygotes or hemizygotes. The development of the Gal4–UAS system (Brand and Perrimon 1993) to include drivers for the hematopoietic system makes it more feasible to be able to investigate the blood cell phenotypes of mutant genes, for example, Kimbrell et al. (2002) and Zettervall et al. (2004). The hemese-Gal4 construct drives expression in blood cells of the plasmatocyte and lamellocyte classes (Zettervall et al. 2004). Strains with hemese-Gal4 UAS-GFP thus have the blood cells marked with GFP, enabling hemocyte counting and phenotype analysis in various genetic strains (Zettervall et al. 2004). We used hemese-Gal4 UAS-GFP to investigate the blood cells of dappled melanotic tumor mutants. In melanotic tumors of dpld EJL /dpld MLB; hemese-Gal4 UAS-GFP larvae, all of the cells in the masses were found to fluoresce strongly for GFP (Fig. 4). Cell counts of circulating plasmatocytes and lamellocytes showed large numbers of circulating lamellocytes (Fig. 4). Lamellocytes are not found in normal, healthy larvae, whereas in melanotic nodule mutants lamellocytes are abundant (Crozatier and Meister 2007). The dappled melanotic tumors are thus specifically designated as melanotic nodules, which consist of hemocytes, as opposed to melanizations, which are non-blood cell tissues that have melanized (Minakhina and Steward 2006b). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Hemocytes of dappled viable mutants. a Hemocytes visualized by GFP expression show (left) melanotic tumors/nodules in a third-instar larva as clumps of hemocytes that are partially melanized, along with circulating plasmatocytes, and (right), at higher magnification, lamellocytes. Lamellocytes are approximately four times larger than plasmatocytes. GFP expression is driven by the hemese-Gal4 driver. b Cell counts of circulating hemocytes in early and late wandering third-instar larvae show high levels of lamellocytes and characterize the dynamic process of melanotic tumor formation by comparing mutants with small (left bars) versus large (right bars) melanotic nodules. Error bars show 0.95 confidence limits. N ≥ 15 for each category. (Color figure online)Mutant dappled larvae were categorized based on the relative size of the melanotic nodules. Larvae with small versus large melanotic nodules showed different numbers of circulating plasmatocytes and lamellocytes (Fig. 4). Notably, lamellocytes are more prevalent in small tumors, whereas plasmatocytes are more abundant in large nodules. One possible interpretation of the higher number of lamellocytes in smaller nodules is that these nodules are still actively forming, and lamellocytes are still being recruited to the nodules. During normal larval development, the number of plasmatocytes typically increases two- to threefold from the early wandering (early) to the late wandering (late) stage of the third instar (Crozatier and Meister 2007; Zettervall et al. 2004). Plasmatocyte representation from early to late stage wandering was different for small and large tumors. Larvae with large tumors showed an increase from early to late stage, whereas larvae with small tumors did not (Fig. 4), and this may also reflect the dynamic nature of dappled melanotic nodule formation. Heterozygosity of dappled does not produce tumors, but it does have a dominant effect on blood cell number. The dappled heterozygotes (Bal/dpld) have a significantly higher number of plasmatocytes than wild-type larvae (+/+). This difference was confirmed by counting hemocytes of dappled heterozygotes (dpld/+) and their control siblings (Bal/+) (Fig. 5). Further, counts of siblings showed that the increase in plasmatocytes is present both early and late in the third instar. The relative numbers of lamellocytes in dappled heterozygotes is less clear, as the average was very low, many larvae had no lamellocytes, and the number did not increase from early to late stage (Fig. 5). Thus, although the lamellocyte data are statistically significant (P < 0.05), dappled heterozygosity at most yields a very weak induction of lamellocyte differentiation. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Plasmatocytes and lamellocytes are increased in dappled heterozygotes. a Cell counts of plasmatocytes during late third instar of dappled heterozygotes, over a Balancer (Bal) or wild-type (+) chromosome, show significantly more plasmatocytes than wild-type (+/+) and Balancer (Bal/+) controls. Counts were normalized across three experiments to the percentage of controls. The average for control +/+ was 5,697 cells/larva and Bal/+ was 4,935 cells/larva. P < 0.01 for dpld/+ versus Bal/+, and P < 0.05 for Bal/dpld versus +/+. b Cell counts of plasmatocytes of dappled heterozygotes and controls that are siblings show that the increase in plasmatocytes has already occurred by early wandering third instar. Additionally, dappled heterozygotes show a normal increase, which is approximately two- to threefold, in plasmatocyte number from early to late stage. Counts were normalized across three experiments to the percentage of control Bal/+ late, which averaged 4,125 cells/larva. P < 0.01 for both early and late of dpld/+ versus Bal/+. c Cell counts of the larvae (b) show that lamellocytes are also increased. Control Bal/+ larvae had no lamellocytes in any sample. P < 0.05 for both early and late dpld/+ versus Bal/+. The average number of cells in early dappled heterozygotes was 5, with high variability and no significant difference from late dappled heterozygotes (P > 0.05). N ≥ 15 per genotype for each experimentRescue of Hemocyte Phenotype but Not Lethality by Wild-Type dappled in Blood Cells We next asked if the dappled phenotype could be rescued by expressing wild-type dappled only in blood cells. We constructed a plasmid containing UAS-dpld, which was used to make transgenic strains with UAS-dpld in different chromosomal locations. The hemese-Gal4 was then used to drive UAS-dpld, and the rates of melanotic nodule formation were compared in dappled mutants and controls. In addition to hemocytes, hemese-Gal4 drives strong expression in the salivary glands, so a control salivary gland driver, sgs3-Gal4, was also used to drive UAS-dpld. To test for rescue of lethality by ubiquitous expression, the da-Gal4 driver (Pili-Floury et al. 2004) was used. The dappled mutants with hemese-Gal4, but not sgs3-Gal4, driving UAS-dpld are rescued from the melanotic phenotype. Three different UAS-dpld insertions were tested with hemese-Gal4, and all showed similar rates of rescue (Table 1). Dissections were performed to determine if blood cell nodules might be forming but not melanizing. The dissections confirmed that blood cell nodule formation without accompanying melanization did not occur. Table 1.

Hemocyte counts of dappled heterozygotes with hemese-Gal4 driving UAS-dpld had, on average, reduced numbers of hemocytes, compared with control dappled heterozygotes (Fig. 6). The number of lamellocytes in heterozygotes was also reduced on average, but with the small number and variability in lamellocytes, was not significantly different (Fig. 6). These results do not necessarily rule out other tissues as important for the dappled mutant blood cell phenotypes, but rather emphasize that the level of dappled expression in the blood cells regulates number and differentiation. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Rescue of dappled heterozygote phenotype by expression of wild-type dappled in hemocytes. The dappled heterozygotes with UAS-dpld driven by hemese-Gal4 (Bal/dpld UAS-dpld) were compared with controls without UAS and Gal4 (Bal/dpld and Bal/+). Counts were normalized across three experiments to the percentage of Bal/dpld. Plasmatocyte counts (a) are significantly reduced in rescued larvae compared with Bal/dpld (P < 0.05), but not compared with Bal/+ (P > 0.05). Lamellocyte counts (b) are reduced on average in rescued larvae, but not to a significant extent (P > 0.05, compared with both Bal/dpld and Bal/+). N ≥ 15 per genotype for each experimentExpression of wild-type dappled in blood cells did not rescue the mutant lethality. In contrast, ubiquitous expression of wild-type dappled completely rescued the mutant lethality, producing normal adults with no tumors (Table 2). These results are consistent with the aberrant tissue morphology of lethal dappled (Rodriguez et al. 1996) and establish the importance of dappled transcript levels for normal function in other tissues.

As noted above, plasmatocytes in dappled tumors express the hemese-Gal4 driver, which does not express in the lymph glands, further indicating an early developmental origin for these cells. Additionally, the lymph glands appear normal, at least at a gross level, and only one dappled enhancer trap expresses in the lymph glands (Rodriguez et al. 1996). We analyzed 1 kb of the dappled upstream region for potential binding by blood cell, lymph gland, and other transcription factors using the Transfac database (Wingender 2008) provided by Biobase Biological Databases (http://www.biobase-international.com/index.php?id=home). Among the transcription factor binding sites are many that are predicted to be T cell factor/pan binding sites (Brunner et al. 1997), consistent with blood cell expression, and tinman/Nkx2.5 binding sites (Kimbrell et al. 2002), suggesting lymph gland expression (Table 3).

Cells of the two waves were differentiated by (1) using hemese-Gal4 to drive UAS-GFP in cells from the first wave of development, so that first-wave cells fluoresced green, and (2) staining all hemocytes with monochlorobimane dye, so that the second-wave hemocytes fluoresced blue but not green. The developmental stage selected to have both sets of hemocytes was white prepupae, age 0–3 h postformation as white prepupae. These results show that heterozygosity of dappled increases the number of plasmatocytes from both hematopoietic waves (Table 4). Table 4.

Similar numbers of the sexes are needed per sample, however, as the sexes differ in the number of hemocytes. For the experiment depicted in Table 4, we separated the sexes in order to demonstrate this finding and test for a sex difference in the second hematopoietic wave as well. The results are that in both wild type and dappled there is a significant difference between males and females in the number of hemocytes for both hematopoietic waves.Curcumin Enhancement of the dappled Melanotic Phenotype Cytochrome b5 is widely studied for its effects on drug metabolism, and conversely, various drugs are investigated for alteration of cytochrome b5 levels (El-Lakkany et al. 2004; Juvonen et al. 1992; Portoles et al. 1989; Schenkman and Jansson 1999; Sheweita 2004; Yamaori et al. 2003; Yamazaki et al. 2002). We hypothesized that modulation of the dappled phenotype could be used as an in vivo assay for cytochrome b5 related effects of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. We are therefore screening compounds with a known connection to cytochrome P450s and/or anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties for enhancement or suppression of the dappled melanotic phenotype. Initial studies with aspirin and the corticosteroid dexamethasone are negative (data not shown), whereas curcumin, the active ingredient in the spice turmeric, has consistently shown an enhancement of the melanotic phenotype (Table 5; Fig. 7). Adult dappled mutants that have been raised (egg to adult) on curcumin-supplemented food have an enhanced melanotic phenotype, showing more and/or larger melanotic tumors (Table 5). The enhanced phenotype of the dappled mutants is already evident in the larval stages (Fig. 7). Adult dappled heterozygotes, however, do not develop a melanotic phenotype when raised on curcumin (Table 5). Since both the heterozygotes and heteroallelic mutants have some reduction in dappled transcript levels, the effects of curcumin may depend on the exact amount of cytochrome b5 protein that is produced.

(Color figure online)Discussion We have identified dappled as a member of the conserved, ubiquitous cytochrome b5 family. The complexities of cytochrome b5 function, through its participation in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions, are reflected in the difficulties and limited study of its genetics in higher organisms. Characterizations in humans have shown that cytochrome b5 mutation causes methemoglobinemia, which interferes with the balance between hemoglobin and methemoglobin, thus affecting oxygenation and inflammation (Hegesh et al. 1986; Umbreit 2007). Mutation of cytochrome b5 reductase also causes methemoglobinemia and is more common (Davis et al. 2004). In addition, one case of cytochrome b5 methemoglobinemia may also have been associated with hormonal defects (Giordano et al. 1994). With the exception of a porcine mutation associated with an altered androstenone level (Lin et al. 2005), cytochrome b5 mutations in other organisms have not been identified. In mice, cytochrome b5 deletion is also lethal, but experiments with a tissue-specific knockout have allowed liver function to be addressed (Finn et al. 2008). With our studies of dappled, Drosophila now provides a tractable genetic model for the study of cytochrome b5 in blood cells and other tissues. Hemocytes are particularly sensitive to mutation of dappled and show that cytochrome b5 functions to produce normal differentiation and numbers of hemocytes. Mutation of one copy of dappled results in a significant increase in the number of circulating hemocytes, and mutation of both copies results in the formation of melanotic nodules. The formation of dappled melanotic nodules is a Class 2 reaction in the classification of Watson et al. (1991), in which Class 2 represents alteration of immune cells and Class 1 represents normal immune cells responding to other cell types that are aberrant. The dominant effect on blood cell number emphasizes that wild-type levels of cytochrome b5 are needed for full normal functions. In humans, levels of cytochrome b5 have been implicated as important with respect to xenobiotic metabolism and health. Kurian et al. (2007) hypothesized that functionally significant genetic variability in cytochrome b5 occurs in individuals without clinical symptoms. They investigated processing of hydroxylamines, which are oxidative products of arylamine drugs and environmental carcinogens, by the mutant cytochrome b5 of one heterozygous individual and found, in vitro, altered affinity for hydroxylamine substrates and dramatically reduced cytochrome b5 expression (Kurian et al. 2007). Expression of wild-type dappled in hemocytes rescued both the increase in blood cell number and the formation of melanotic nodules. The driver used was hemese-Gal4, which is active in circulating plasmatocytes and sessile hemocytes, but not the lymph glands (Markus et al. 2009; Zettervall et al. 2004). Interestingly, the sessile hemocytes are a newly discovered hematopoietic site and appear to be the main developmental origin of lamellocytes (Markus et al. 2009). This site of expression may be the key factor in rescuing the dappled melanotic nodule phenotype. Rescue of the plasmatocyte increase in dappled heterozygotes is expected to result from the hemese-Gal4 expression in circulating blood cells of the first hematopoietic wave, both because of the age of the larvae (prerelease of lymph gland cells) and because hemese-Gal4 does not express in lymph glands. However, dappled also increased the number of hemocytes from the second hematopoietic wave. Hemocytes from both developmental origins, embryonic and lymph gland, require dappled in order to be produced in normal amounts. It is an interesting question as to whether the plasmatocyte increase in dappled mutants can be independently controlled in the first and second hematopoietic waves. Does the increase in plasmatocytes indicate overproliferation or less apoptosis? Since dappled encodes a cytochrome b5, the obvious choice would be apoptosis rather than overproliferation. There are two problems with this choice: it is mitochondrial cytochrome b5 that is established in the canonical cytochrome C signaling apoptotic pathway, and the use of that pathway by Drosophila is controversial (Kornbluth and White 2005; Means and Hays 2007; Oberst et al. 2008; Ow et al. 2008). Microsomal cytochrome b5, however, has also been suggested to be involved in cytochrome C mediated apoptosis (Davydov 2001), and Drosophila may have its own version of apoptotic signaling that uses the dappled cytochrome b5. Further, blood cells are well described for their role in response to apoptotic cells, but the role of their own apoptosis in development and infection is not clear (Bruckner et al. 2004; Crozatier and Meister 2007; Lemaitre and Hoffmann 2007). The sensitivity of hemocytes (compared with other cell types) to dappled mutation may result from blood cell mitotic cell division continuing during development (Crozatier and Meister 2007). There are many potential mechanisms for dappled to affect overproliferation, especially given the increasingly complex functions of plasmatocytes (Charroux and Royet 2009). One option consistent with cytochrome b5 function, and potentially the dappled effects on fertility, is that hormonal signaling of hematopoiesis is affected. In that case, however, rescue of the dappled blood cell phenotype would be predicted by adding back wild-type dappled expression in the steroid-producing ring gland (Gilbert 2004) rather than hemocytes. Alternatively, dappled expression could rescue a steroid-processing step in the hemocytes. An intriguing option is that cytochrome b5 has a new, previously unidentified role in blood cell signaling pathways, for example, through JAK/Stat or JNK. More specifically, a candidate to mediate the effects of dappled is TNF-receptor associated factor 6 (Traf6), which is predicted from protein studies to interact with cytochrome b5 (Drosophila Interactions Database, http://www.droidb.org). Among its activities, Traf6 is an upstream activator of nuclear factor-kappaB, and mutants are immune response defective (Cha et al. 2003; Wu and Arron 2003). Cytochrome b5 involvement with Traf6 is a testable hypothesis through analysis of genetic interaction between dappled and Traf6 mutants. Our results with curcumin demonstrate that screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds for effects on the dappled phenotypes can be done as an in vivo approach for analysis of cytochrome b5. Curcumin is widely studied for its potential as a nutritional pharmaceutical (Duvoix et al. 2005; Jagetia and Aggarwal 2007). Among its many activities, which are mainly anti-inflammatory and anticancer, curcumin inhibits cytochrome P450s, down-regulates NFkB, and affects apoptosis and the cell cycle (Alpers 2008; Appiah-Opong et al. 2007; Kwon et al. 2007; Sa and Das 2008). Curcumin enhanced the melanotic phenotype of dappled mutants. This effect of curcumin is consistent with NFkB involvement, but there are other alternatives, in particular, cytochrome P450 processing in the fat body. Mutation of dappled showed similar effects in females and males, but an unexpected consequence of our studies is the finding that females and males differ significantly in the number of circulating blood cells. In humans, a difference between the sexes in the numbers of blood cell types is well established, but the effects are unclear (Blum and Pabst 2007; Huppert et al. 1998; Reichert et al. 1991). In both humans and Drosophila, there are differences in the immune responses between the sexes that affect health (Dale et al. 2006; Marriott and Huet-Hudson 2006; Shames 2002; Taylor and Kimbrell 2007; Ye et al. 2009; Zandman-Goddard et al. 2007), and the blood cell number differential may be part of mediating the immune response differences. Recently, Drosophila hemocytes have been shown to directly signal immune induction of the fat body, and a reduced number of hemocytes resulted in less immune induction (Shia et al. 2009). In Drosophila, the increase in hemocytes of dappled and females may result in higher immune induction, which may or may not provide a healthier condition. For example, human females typically have a more robust immune response but also a higher incidence of autoimmune disorders (Dale et al. 2006; Zandman-Goddard et al. 2007). Cytochrome b5 expression is critical for survival, and its importance to hemocytes and additional tissues is emphasized by the finding that ubiquitous, but not hemocyte, expression of wild-type dappled rescued lethality. The functions of cytochrome b5 are open for testing in a wide range of tissue types using dappled. In all respects, genetic interaction and drug screens for suppressors and enhancers of dappled will be useful ways to discern the many roles of cytochrome b5 function.Acknowledgments We thank the Bloomington Stock Center for fly strains and Dan Hultmark for the hemese-Gal4 stock.

    "abstract": "Abstract Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity. Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1g. A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities. Keywords: Arabidopsis, Fractional gravity, Microgravity, Phototropism, Reduced gravity, Spaceflight",
    "introduction": "Introduction Plant tropisms are growth-mediated movements relative to the direction of an external stimulus. In early studies, these movements were first characterized by Darwin and Darwin (1880), however, description of plant movement actually dates back to the Ancient Romans (Ovid 8 AD 2008). Plants exhibit these growth-mediated responses to external cues, including water (hydrotropism, Kiss 2007), touch or contact (thigmotropism, Braam 2005), the sun or light (heliotropism and phototropism, respectively Briggs 1964; Vandenbrink et al. 2014a, b; Kutschera and Briggs 2016), and gravity (gravitropism, Chen et al. 1999; Kiss 2000) among others. Tropisms are important for plants, which as sessile organisms, utilize these movements to respond to external stimuli (Kaufman et al. 1987; Whippo and Hangarter 2004). Typically, in ground studies, plants respond to blue-light photostimulation positively (growth towards the light) in shoots, and negatively (growth away from the light source) in roots (Kutschera and Briggs 2012; Briggs 2014; Liscum et al. 2014). Recently, a positive red-light-based phototropic response in roots mediated by phytochromes has been observed and characterized (Kiss et al. 2003; Molas and Kiss 2008), in addition to positive hypocotyl phototropic response to red light in the conditions of microgravity (Millar et al. 2010). However, the magnitude of phototropic response is less during red-light stimulation compared with the robust response to blue light. In terms of gravitropic response, in general, plants respond to the gravity vector by growing roots in the direction of gravity, and shoots opposite of the gravity vector. The amalgamation of tropistic movements results in the overall direction and form of plant growth (Correll and Kiss 2002). Plants utilize both gravity and light cues to direct plant growth and development. In addition to directing root growth towards the gravity vector, sunlight can penetrate the soil up to several millimeters beneath the soil surface, having a direct effect on the growth and development of roots (Woolley and Stoller 1978; Tester and Morris 1987). The red and far-red part of the light spectrum can penetrate to greater depths than blue light (Mandoli and Briggs 1984) which has led to plants evolving blue-light receptors located near the upper portion of roots and red-light receptors near the apices due to this pattern of light penetration (Mo et al. 2015). In addition, it has been shown that plants utilize blue-light cues to control root architectural features, such as lateral root growth (Moni et al. 2015). Light perception by the roots may also impact plant growth and development elsewhere, as light signals sensed by root apices have also been shown to have an effect on shoot gravitropic response (Hopkins and Kiss 2012). Taken together, these observations suggest that light perception within the root plays a dynamic role in plant development. Specifically, an effect of light irradiation on shortening the root length has been reported (Silva-Navas et al. 2015), although other works have shown higher rates of root elongation under light-grown conditions (Laxmi et al. 2008). Modulation of cell-cycle progression by photoreceptors in meristems is well known, but there are data indicating that this action of light is different in the root and in the shoot meristems (López-Juez et al. 2008; Silva-Navas et al. 2015). To perceive light stimuli, plants contain specialized photoreceptor proteins specific to red, blue, and UV-B light. Plants sense blue light via two types of light receptors: cryptochromes and phototropins. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, PHOT1 and PHOT2 (Christie et al. 1999), and two cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2 (Christie et al. 2014). In addition, red-light perception is carried out by phytochromes, while UV-B perception is carried out by protein UVR8 (Brown and Jenkins 2008). In addition to regulating phototropic growth, phytochromes have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes, from seed germination to plant senescence. To date, five phytochromes have been identified in Arabidopsis, and all have been linked to phototropistic response (Correll et al. 2003; Kiss et al. 2003; Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004; Kumar et al. 2008). The relationship between phototropism and gravitropism is a complex, poorly characterized interaction, where the direction of growth is an amalgamation of the two processes. To isolate phototropic response to a directional light source, the confounding gravity vector must first be removed. The utilization of facilities on board the International Space Station (ISS) provides the ability to conduct experiments in an environment of near-weightlessness, allowing for the study of “pure” phototropism, in the absence of a gravitropic response (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). Specifically, using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus module of the ISS provides the ability to study phototropic response to red or blue light in the absence of a unidirectional gravity vector. While plant growth and development in microgravity environments has been well characterized, considerably less is known about plant growth and development in fractional or reduced gravity environments (less than the nominal 1g; Kiss 2014). The EMCS contains a centrifuge which allows for the creation of gravity vectors to better characterize the interplay between gravitropism and phototropism. Our previous space experiments examined the phototropic response to red and blue light in microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g, and 1g environments (Kiss et al. 2012), providing insight on how plant growth and development may be effected on the Moon or Mars. Understanding how plants grow and develop in fractional gravity environment is an important step in successful habitation of the Moon or Mars. Furthermore, fractional gravity studies are helpful for the determination of thresholds of the gravity sensing and response of plants. In this study, we utilize micro-gravity as well as a continuum of fractional gravity (μ-g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, and 1g) to better characterize the phototropic responses to red and blue light. In addition, we analyze the effects of a brief, red-light pretreatment on blue-light-based phototropism.",

    "results": "Results The aim of this study was to investigate phototropism under a continuum of gravity conditions from microgravity, to partial (reduced) gravity, to 1g. Arabidopsis roots and shoots exhibit markedly different phototropic curvatures in different gravity conditions upon exposure to red or blue light. Initially, plants were grown for 96 h with unilateral white light and simulated 1g in an attempt to standardize the orientation of all seedlings (Fig. 2). During photostimulation, gravity levels of 0g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, or 1g were generated via centrifugation. Images taken prior to directional light photostimulation allowed assessment of seedling growth and development (Fig. 1). Seedlings with slow germination or improper development were excluded from analyses. The phototropic response in roots was measured as positive growth (towards photostimulation) or negative growth (away from photostimulation) from the initial vertical state. Multiple regression analysis of root phototropic response found significant effects from gravity (P <2.2 × 10−16), light quality (P <2.74 × 10−15), and position (P < 2.08 × 10−9). Genotype also had a significant effect on phototropic response in root (P = 0.02; Table S3). The phototropic response of roots grown in blue light demonstrates a novel, positive phototropic response under microgravity (Figs. 3, 4). This response was attenuated at 0.1g, and is not present at higher gravity levels. In plants pretreated with red light for 1 h and subsequently exposed to blue light (Fig. 5), roots experience greater phototropic response (larger angles) when compared with blue-light exposure. Similar to blue-light root phototropism, the response is attenuated at 0.1g and not present in higher gravity levels. Finally, we observe a positive root phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 6), and the positive phototropic curvature decreases steadily as the magnitude of gravity increases.

Open in a new tab Phototropic response in roots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. The positive phototropic response to red light in roots exhibits an inverse relationship with magnitude of the gravity vector Similarly, multiple regression analysis was conducted for hypocotyls. Arabidopsis hypocotyls displayed significant effects from light (P < 2.2 × 10−16), genotype (P <0.05) and position (P < 4.9 × 10−5). However, no significant effect was detected for gravity (P = 0.055; Table S4). Not surprisingly, on Earth, the phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue-light phototropism shows a robust response immediately upon stimulation, followed by cessation once the hypocotyl reaches ~90° (Fig. 7). This same trend is also exhibited in hypocotyls of plants initially pretreated with red light and subsequent illuminated with blue light (Fig. 8). There is no significant gravity effect on the phototropic response in red light pretreated or blue light illuminated hypocotyls. In hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to red light, we observe a positive phototropic curvature in plants exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 9). Unlike hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to blue light, red-light exposure causes a steady positive phototropic response over time. However, similar to hypocotyls exposed to blue light, there is no significant effect of gravity on phototropic curvature. Fig. 7.

Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment Seedling position within the cassette also was shown to have a significant effect on phototropic curvature in both hypocotyls and roots. This is likely due to the variation in light intensity experienced within the seedling cassettes. Blue-light intensity decreases significantly the further the plant is from the light (Suppl. Fig. S1) ranging from 41.5 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position furthest from the LED. A similar trend is seen in red-light intensity, with illumination ranging from 59.6 μmol m−2 s−1 of light nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 furthest from the LED (Suppl. Fig. S2). To study the effects of microgravity on overall growth, we measured root and shoot lengths during the period of photostimulation. ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test of root (Table 1) and shoot (Table 2) total growth indicate that there are no significant differences in growth between microgravity and 1-g treatments. In addition, Pearson’s correlations were conducted to determine if overall growth was significantly correlated with phototropic curvature of seedlings. The correlation between total root growth and rate of root curvature was not significant (r = 0.20, P = 0.14), suggesting no relationship between root growth and curvature. However, in hypocotyls, the correlation between shoot growth and curvature was significant (r = 0.31, P = 0.02), suggesting that total shoot growth has an impact on rate of shoot curvature.

    "discussion": "Discussion Continued technical improvements to space experiments on plant tropisms Results from these experiments expand upon and optimize the previous experiments performed under conditions of microgravity and reduced gravity on board the ISS (Table 3). During the TROPI-1 series of experiments, germination rates were severely hampered by excess stowage time (>8 months) of the seeds prior to the activation of the experiment in space (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). During TROPI-2, we found that reducing the stowage time of seeds (<3 months) resulted in a dramatic increase in seed germination (Kiss et al. 2009). In addition, it was discovered after the conclusion of the TROPI experiments that utilization of the EMCS’s two-rotor setup resulted in a slight light contamination between the two rotors, which may have caused non-unidirectional light sources (Kiss et al. 2014). The current seedling growth set of experiments were conducted utilizing a single rotor of the EMCS to remove the possibility of between-rotor light contamination and have been optimized in many other ways (Table 3). The large range in sample sizes (6–50) of the various conditions was a product of multiple factors. Due to limited space, the design of the experiment necessitated an unbalanced experimental design, where half as many plants were grown under blue light or were pretreated with red light. In addition, there was reduced germination during the second spaceflight experiment for the Ler WT and PhyA genotypes. The reduction in germination in likely due to the extended period of time the seeds remained in hardware prior to spaceflight, as germination counts during flight build were in excess of 85 % (data not shown). Reducing the time between hardware build and execution of the experiment can help to increase germination rates and to maximize scientific return of space-flight experiments. Phototropic responses in roots Under the conditions of microgravity, a novel positive blue-light phototropic response was observed in roots of seedlings (Figs. 3, 4). While blue-light-based negative phototropism in roots has been extensively characterized in ground studies (Correll and Kiss 2002), this positive phototropic response is greatly reduced at 0.1g, and effectively negated at 0.3g and higher gravity levels. To date, this phototropic response has not previously been observed in the roots of Arabidopsis. This observation suggests that positive phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots is masked by the much more robust gravitropic response in Earth normal conditions, and the response can only be observed when the gravity vector is greatly reduced or eliminated, as can be observed in space experiments in orbiting vehicles. Interestingly, the relationship between the blue-light-positive phototropic response and gravity appears to represent a threshold model, where gravity levels between 0g and 0.1g eliminate the blue positive phototropic response. Interestingly, the previous clinorotation studies conducted by our group did not demonstrate positive phototropic curvature of roots when exposed to blue light. This observation suggests that while informative and beneficial, clinorotation studies are not a perfect proxy for actual microgravity, and further highlights the need for true spaceflight experiments. In addition to the blue-light phototropic response, a 1-h red-light pretreatment, followed by continuous blue illumination was tested (Fig. 5). Similar to the blue-light exposure only phototropic response revealed in roots, red-light pretreated roots exhibited an immediate and robust response in the direction of the blue-light photostimulus. The magnitude of the total positive phototropic curvature was at least 25 % greater in roots exposed to red-light pretreatment compared with those exposed solely to blue light. These results are not unexpected, as the previous studies of Arabidopsis have shown that etiolated (dark-grown) seedlings exposed to red-light pretreatment experience an increase in the blue-light phototropic response (Sakai and Haga 2012; Goyal et al. 2013). In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that overhead pretreatment with blue-light illumination also enhances the phototropic response (Sullivan et al. 2016). It has been proposed that this effect is due to red, far red, and blue light all acting together as an activator of phytochrome A, which leads to enhancement of the phototropic response (Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004). However, it is interesting to note that we do not see a significant difference in phototropic response in phyA mutants when compared with the wild type. This observation suggests that phytochrome A does not contribute to enhancement of blue-light positive phototropic response in roots. In addition, there is no apparent effect of genotype on the overall magnitude of phototropic response of roots pretreated with red light. A similar attenuation of positive phototropic curvature at 0.1g is also exhibited under red-light pretreatment when compared with non-pretreated samples. Cessation of curvature appears as a similar thresholding response between 0g and 0.1g, which negates positive phototropic curvature in red-light pretreated samples. As noted in our previous space experiments (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012), plant roots exposed to illumination with red light also experienced positive phototropic curvature (Fig. 6). The positive phototropic response is confirmed and is similar to what has previously been characterized during the TROPI experiments, however, the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature is greater than in the previous results (Kiss et al. 2012). Interestingly, two distinctions exist when comparing the root phototropic response to red vs. blue light. First, the positive phototropic curvature in response to red light is not eliminated at the onset of gravitational acceleration. Rather, it appears that the rate of root positive phototropic curvature is inversely correlated with the magnitude of the gravity vector, with the largest magnitude of curvature being experienced in seedlings exposed to microgravity. Second, there appears to be a genotype-specific effect at low gravity conditions, where the WT shows much higher levels of positive phototropic curvature when compared with phytochrome mutant varieties. However, this genotype effect appears to be negated at gravity levels of 0.5g and greater. Comparison of the root phototropic responses to red light and blue light reveals unique patterns between the two treatments. Utilization of fractional or reduced gravity conditions allowed for the identification of gravity levels that correspond with an attenuation of response, which differed between the two light treatments. Interestingly, a threshold value of 0.1–0.3g is enough to cease phototropic curvature in roots illuminated with blue light; however, this same threshold is not observed in red light, which exhibits something akin to a gravity dose response. This difference in response suggests that the mechanisms controlling the interaction between gravitropic response and phototropic response are different for red and blue light. In addition, the enhancement of the blue-light phototropic response in roots after red-light pretreatment suggests that while the two responses differ in pattern and potentially, mechanisms, there is still an additive effect that causes an enhancement to total phototropic curvature. The notion of positive blue-light phototropism in roots tends to contradict the traditional understanding of phototropic function, where roots move in the opposite direction of blue light to grow deeper into soil. However, these observed differences in phototropism between 1g and μg in Arabidopsis may reflect the evolutionary history of plants. For instance, plants from older evolutionary lineages, such as mosses and ferns, have a very versatile directional response to both red and blue light (Kiss 1994; Wada 2007; Li and Mathews 2016). Thus, microgravity may reveal mechanisms of phototropism that are normally masked by Earth nominal gravity conditions. It is possible that the near-linear relationship between red-light phototropic response and gravity in roots is a result of cytosolic calcium ions which have been thought to play a key role in the transmission of gravity sensing (Poovaiah et al. 1987; Gilroy et al. 1993; Correll et al. 2013), potentially through regulating the distribution of auxin and auxin transporters within the root cells (Benjamins et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2011; Shih et al. 2015). A study conducted by Toyota et al. (2013) utilized parabolic flight to examine the effects of reduced gravity gradients on calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This study examined the gravitropic response to gravity vectors ranging from 0.5g to 2.0g and found intercellular Ca2+ signaling exhibits a near-linear relationship with gravistimulation. This linear relationship between gravity sensing and Ca2+ signaling is the inverse of the observed red-light-induced phototropic curvature in roots observed in our present study, suggesting a potential antagonistic relationship with the root red-light phototropic response mechanisms. A recent study also utilized parabolic flights to examine cytosolic calcium levels on Arabidopsis cell cultures (Neef et al. 2015). In addition, this report demonstrated a clear link between several known Ca2+ inhibitors/antagonists and changes in cytosolic calcium due to gravity. However, this study also identified a single Ca2+ (nifedipine) inhibitor that had no effect on calcium signaling, suggesting the possibility of unique calcium channels or pumps involved in gravity signaling. It is possible that a gradual reduction in cytosolic calcium levels is responsible for the decreased positive phototropic response associated with increasing gravity. Phototropic responses in hypocotyls As in ground studies, plant hypocotyls exposed to continuous blue-light illumination showed an immediate and robust positive phototropic response in the direction of the light stimulus, followed by continuous growth at 90° in the direction of the light source (Fig. 7). As expected, there is no statistically significant effect of genotype on the phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to blue light. Gravity also did not have a significant effect on the direction, response time, or magnitude of hypocotyl phototropic curvature in response to unidirectional blue-light illumination. However, we do see a significant statistical correlation between the distances of the seedling from the light source, and the rate of positive phototropic curvature. These results correspond to our previous characterization of blue-light phototropic response in hypocotyls, where no increase in curvature was observed when exposed to microgravity conditions (Kiss et al. 2012). Red-light pretreatment of seedlings exposed to blue light did not result in an observable increase in the rate of positive phototropic response, and the pattern of phototropic curvature mirrored those seedlings that were not exposed to red-light pretreatment (Fig. 8). Interestingly, a recent study found that curvature enhancements stemming from red- or blue-light pretreatments were affected by light intensity, where higher fluence rates of the directional light caused a reduction in phototropic curvature (Sullivan et al. 2016). It is possible that enhancement of phototropic curvature was not observed in this case due to fluence rates that were high enough to inhibit the enhancement of curvature. In addition, it is possible that due to the rapid phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue light, we were unable to capture differences in curvature rate from the frequency of images we obtained (every 30 min). Increasing the rate of image capture (e.g., every 5 min) would likely help to identify enhancements in phototropic curvature of hypocotyls pretreated with red light. Analyses of seedlings grown in microgravity conditions and exposed to red light (Fig. 9) have confirmed previously characterized positive phototropic curvature of Arabidopsis hypocotyls (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). This positive hypocotyl curvature was previously characterized during the TROPI experiment series, however, it must be noted that the magnitude of the positive phototropic curvatures is less than what was measured during TROPI-2 (Kiss et al. 2012). These results are similar in magnitude and in accordance with results obtained from the TROPI-1 experiment (Millar et al. 2010). These differences can likely be attributed to the light contamination between rotors in the earlier experiments (Kiss et al. 2014), as all other conditions within the experiment were unaltered. In addition, the magnitude of positive hypocotyl phototropism when exposed to red light does not appear to be contingent on the gravity vector, whereas the previous study found a significant difference in rates of phototropic curvature in hypocotyls exposed to low gravity (μg or 0.1g) versus more substantial gravity vectors (0.3g or 1g). Previously, positive phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to red light was shown to be enhanced in phyB mutants when compared with phyA and WT varieties (Kiss et al. 2012). However, as all three genotypes tested show positive phototropic responses that were not significantly different, these results were not reproduced in this study. Again, we attribute these differences to the fact that we have improved the experimental conditions in this report by eliminating the stray light between rotors in the current studies. Phototropic responses and illumination intensity Multiple regression analyses of phototropic curvature in both roots and shoots revealed position as a significant variable that predicts the rate of phototropic curvature. This effect is due to the observed differences in illumination across the membrane as the distance from the light source increases (Suppl. Fig. S1 and S2). Therefore, within a cassette where all seedlings are exposed to directional light for the same duration, seedlings furthest from the light source receive reduced fluency from the lights, and, in turn, exhibit reduced phototropic curvature. However, while the magnitude of curvature differed significantly across fluence rates, the overall proportional trend in curvature was conserved. The relationship between fluence rates and phototropic curvature is well characterized (Janoudi and Poff 1990; Sakai et al. 2001). Traditionally, illumination and curvature of hypocotyls follow the Bunsen-Roscoe law, where curvature is a product of illumination intensity and the duration of exposure (Bunsen and Roscoe 1863). However, the previous studies characterizing phototropic response have reported that this relationship ceases to be valid at illumination intensities of greater than 0.01 μmol m−2 (Janoudi and Poff 1990), well below the light intensity used in this study. In addition, illumination intensity has previously been shown to have no effect on phototropic curvature of hypocotyls of WT seedlings (Sakai et al. 2001). It also is possible that the significant effect of position on phototropic curvature is the result of the use of non-etiolated seedlings, which our previous spaceflight studies utilized.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions In this study, we characterize a novel blue-light phototropism that is present in microgravity, but is attenuated at low (0.1–0.3g) gravity levels. One-hour red-light pre-treatment followed by blue-light illumination enhanced the rate of positive phototropic curvature in roots. In addition, positive phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red-light was observed; however, increasing levels of gravity causes a gradual reduction in the magnitude of curvature as opposed to the drastic cessation observed under blue-light exposure. The red-light phototropic response of hypocotyls in microgravity, which we have previously characterized, was also confirmed. In addition, the present report shows the value of repetition of space experiments as is usual in ground experiments (Kiss 2015). In the first experiments (TROPI-1 and TROPI-2), we encountered a number of technical issues and obstacles (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). In the more recent Seedling Growth experiments, we were able to solve the technical issues and overcome the limitations of the previous projects (Table 3; Kiss et al. 2014). Thus, in this better controlled light environment in the EMCS, we were able to make new discoveries on the positive phototropism of roots in response to blue light that has added to the previous reports of novel mechanisms of red-light sensing that has been revealed in microgravity. It is clear that effectively removing the ubiquitous gravity vector in spaceflight experiments allows researchers to better understand the myriad of phototropic responses in plants.",

Copyright notice ID: 5748516 MSID: MS926550 PMID: 27507239 The publisher's version of this article is available at Planta Abstract Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity. Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1g. A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities. Keywords: Arabidopsis, Fractional gravity, Microgravity, Phototropism, Reduced gravity, SpaceflightIntroduction Plant tropisms are growth-mediated movements relative to the direction of an external stimulus. In early studies, these movements were first characterized by Darwin and Darwin (1880), however, description of plant movement actually dates back to the Ancient Romans (Ovid 8 AD 2008). Plants exhibit these growth-mediated responses to external cues, including water (hydrotropism, Kiss 2007), touch or contact (thigmotropism, Braam 2005), the sun or light (heliotropism and phototropism, respectively Briggs 1964; Vandenbrink et al. 2014a, b; Kutschera and Briggs 2016), and gravity (gravitropism, Chen et al. 1999; Kiss 2000) among others. Tropisms are important for plants, which as sessile organisms, utilize these movements to respond to external stimuli (Kaufman et al. 1987; Whippo and Hangarter 2004). Typically, in ground studies, plants respond to blue-light photostimulation positively (growth towards the light) in shoots, and negatively (growth away from the light source) in roots (Kutschera and Briggs 2012; Briggs 2014; Liscum et al. 2014). Recently, a positive red-light-based phototropic response in roots mediated by phytochromes has been observed and characterized (Kiss et al. 2003; Molas and Kiss 2008), in addition to positive hypocotyl phototropic response to red light in the conditions of microgravity (Millar et al. 2010). However, the magnitude of phototropic response is less during red-light stimulation compared with the robust response to blue light. In terms of gravitropic response, in general, plants respond to the gravity vector by growing roots in the direction of gravity, and shoots opposite of the gravity vector. The amalgamation of tropistic movements results in the overall direction and form of plant growth (Correll and Kiss 2002). Plants utilize both gravity and light cues to direct plant growth and development. In addition to directing root growth towards the gravity vector, sunlight can penetrate the soil up to several millimeters beneath the soil surface, having a direct effect on the growth and development of roots (Woolley and Stoller 1978; Tester and Morris 1987). The red and far-red part of the light spectrum can penetrate to greater depths than blue light (Mandoli and Briggs 1984) which has led to plants evolving blue-light receptors located near the upper portion of roots and red-light receptors near the apices due to this pattern of light penetration (Mo et al. 2015). In addition, it has been shown that plants utilize blue-light cues to control root architectural features, such as lateral root growth (Moni et al. 2015). Light perception by the roots may also impact plant growth and development elsewhere, as light signals sensed by root apices have also been shown to have an effect on shoot gravitropic response (Hopkins and Kiss 2012). Taken together, these observations suggest that light perception within the root plays a dynamic role in plant development. Specifically, an effect of light irradiation on shortening the root length has been reported (Silva-Navas et al. 2015), although other works have shown higher rates of root elongation under light-grown conditions (Laxmi et al. 2008). Modulation of cell-cycle progression by photoreceptors in meristems is well known, but there are data indicating that this action of light is different in the root and in the shoot meristems (López-Juez et al. 2008; Silva-Navas et al. 2015). To perceive light stimuli, plants contain specialized photoreceptor proteins specific to red, blue, and UV-B light. Plants sense blue light via two types of light receptors: cryptochromes and phototropins. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, PHOT1 and PHOT2 (Christie et al. 1999), and two cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2 (Christie et al. 2014). In addition, red-light perception is carried out by phytochromes, while UV-B perception is carried out by protein UVR8 (Brown and Jenkins 2008). In addition to regulating phototropic growth, phytochromes have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes, from seed germination to plant senescence. To date, five phytochromes have been identified in Arabidopsis, and all have been linked to phototropistic response (Correll et al. 2003; Kiss et al. 2003; Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004; Kumar et al. 2008). The relationship between phototropism and gravitropism is a complex, poorly characterized interaction, where the direction of growth is an amalgamation of the two processes. To isolate phototropic response to a directional light source, the confounding gravity vector must first be removed. The utilization of facilities on board the International Space Station (ISS) provides the ability to conduct experiments in an environment of near-weightlessness, allowing for the study of “pure” phototropism, in the absence of a gravitropic response (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). Specifically, using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus module of the ISS provides the ability to study phototropic response to red or blue light in the absence of a unidirectional gravity vector. While plant growth and development in microgravity environments has been well characterized, considerably less is known about plant growth and development in fractional or reduced gravity environments (less than the nominal 1g; Kiss 2014). The EMCS contains a centrifuge which allows for the creation of gravity vectors to better characterize the interplay between gravitropism and phototropism. Our previous space experiments examined the phototropic response to red and blue light in microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g, and 1g environments (Kiss et al. 2012), providing insight on how plant growth and development may be effected on the Moon or Mars. Understanding how plants grow and develop in fractional gravity environment is an important step in successful habitation of the Moon or Mars. Furthermore, fractional gravity studies are helpful for the determination of thresholds of the gravity sensing and response of plants. In this study, we utilize micro-gravity as well as a continuum of fractional gravity (μ-g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, and 1g) to better characterize the phototropic responses to red and blue light. In addition, we analyze the effects of a brief, red-light pretreatment on blue-light-based phototropism.Materials and methods Plant materials and the spaceflight experiment Three genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana were utilized for this study (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA): wild-type ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler), and the phytochrome mutant’s phyA-201 and phyB-1 (Kiss et al. 2003). Space-flight studies were conducted utilizing the EMCS on the ISS. The EMCS consists of two centrifuges with atmosphere regulation, including ethylene removal, as well as remote hydration control (Brinckmann and Schiller 2002; Brinckmann 2005; Kiss et al. 2014). The utilization of the onboard centrifuge provides an important control with the ability to separate microgravity effects from the other environmental conditions associated with spaceflight (Vandenbrink and Kiss 2016). The EMCS also contains a Sony FCB-IX470 video camera for image acquisition. This experiment was conducted in two parts, with the first set of seedlings being transferred to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-2 (March 2013) followed by return via CRS-3, and the second set being carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (September 2015). Two sets of experimental runs were performed, the first set during ISS increments 35–36, and the second during ISS increment 41.Space hardware and procedures Hardware utilized in this experiment has previously been described (Correll and Kiss 2005; Kiss et al. 2009). Briefly, each experimental container (EC) holds five individual seedling growth cassettes with an LED light source (white, red and blue; Fig. 1). Before flight, seeds were surface sterilized in ethanol and air dried under a laminar flow. The seedling growth media contain 50 % (w/v) Murashige and Skoog salts with 1-mM Mes buffer (pH 5.5). Whatman # 17filter paper was soaked in media and allowed to dry.Seeds were attached to a black gridded nitrocellulose membrane via 1 % (w/v) gum guar. Five seedling cassettes were placed into each EC and stored until launch (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Images of seedlings in cassettes in an EC during a spaceflight experiment run in the EMCS. Seedlings in white light (a) at the beginning of the photostimulation period (0 h) and in red light (b) at the end of photostimulation (48 h). The vertical numbers indicate GMT, Greenwich mean time. White arrows labeled g and L represent the direction of gravity and light vectors, respectivelyProcedures during the spaceflight experiment Experimental containers (Ecs) were transferred to the EMCS on the ISS as described in Kiss et al. (2014). Briefly, experimental conditions were controlled telemetrically from the Norwegian User Support and Operations Centre (N-USOC, Trondheim, Norway), and the initiation of the experiment was conducted via hydration of the seeds. Plants were grown under six gravity conditions: microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, and 1.0g. Seedlings were initially grown under white light (30–40 μmol m−2 s−1) for 96 h, followed by unidirectional photostimulation with red light, blue light, or red → blue light (Fig. 2). Directional photostimulation occurred for 48 h. Illumination intensity throughout the cassette was measured for both blue (Suppl. Fig. S1) and red light (Suppl. Fig. S2) with a Li-Cor LI-189 Quantum Radiometer Photometer. After conclusion of the experiments, seedlings were frozen and stored at −80 °C on the ISS. This manuscript presents the results of image analyses, and future papers will consider the gene experiment profile obtained from the frozen seedlings. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Timeline of operations for the seedling growth experimentsImage and data analyses Growth and curvature of seedlings were measured using the program ImageJ (v.1.50e). Curvature was measured as change in degrees from starting position (defined as 0°). Angles were measured at the initiation of directional red or blue light and subsequently every 30 min for a total of 48.5 h. The number of samples measured for growth and angle per treatment ranged from 6 to 50 and are indicated in Tables S1 and S2. Positive curvature values were defined as growth in the direction of stimulus, and negative curvature was defined as growth away from the stimulus. Analysis of growth and curvature for each genotype was conducted utilizing linear regression of growth rate using the program R 64-bit (version 3.1.3). Regression coefficients compared via one-way ANOVA and subsequent Tukey’s honest significant difference test (P <0.05) were used to identify significant differences between plant growth rates. Data analyses were conducted via linear regression and subsequent ANOVA in R (3.1.3) using the car, multcomp, and agricolae packages. The multiple test correction was conducted using Tukey’s honest significance test (P <0.05). Multiple regression analysis was performed utilizing the following response variables: light-red, blue, or a 1 h red pretreatment before continuous blue illumination; genotype—Ler wild-type, or phytochrome mutants phyA and phyB; gravity—a continuum ranging from 0g/microgravity to 1g; and seedling position—ranging 1–14, with 1 being closes to the source of illumination and 14 the furthest.Results The aim of this study was to investigate phototropism under a continuum of gravity conditions from microgravity, to partial (reduced) gravity, to 1g. Arabidopsis roots and shoots exhibit markedly different phototropic curvatures in different gravity conditions upon exposure to red or blue light. Initially, plants were grown for 96 h with unilateral white light and simulated 1g in an attempt to standardize the orientation of all seedlings (Fig. 2). During photostimulation, gravity levels of 0g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, or 1g were generated via centrifugation. Images taken prior to directional light photostimulation allowed assessment of seedling growth and development (Fig. 1). Seedlings with slow germination or improper development were excluded from analyses. The phototropic response in roots was measured as positive growth (towards photostimulation) or negative growth (away from photostimulation) from the initial vertical state. Multiple regression analysis of root phototropic response found significant effects from gravity (P <2.2 × 10−16), light quality (P <2.74 × 10−15), and position (P < 2.08 × 10−9). Genotype also had a significant effect on phototropic response in root (P = 0.02; Table S3). The phototropic response of roots grown in blue light demonstrates a novel, positive phototropic response under microgravity (Figs. 3, 4). This response was attenuated at 0.1g, and is not present at higher gravity levels. In plants pretreated with red light for 1 h and subsequently exposed to blue light (Fig. 5), roots experience greater phototropic response (larger angles) when compared with blue-light exposure. Similar to blue-light root phototropism, the response is attenuated at 0.1g and not present in higher gravity levels. Finally, we observe a positive root phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 6), and the positive phototropic curvature decreases steadily as the magnitude of gravity increases.

The positive phototropic response to blue light is enhanced by the 1-h red pretreatment. The positive phototropic response is again attenuated by gravityFig. 6. Open in a new tab Phototropic response in roots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. The positive phototropic response to red light in roots exhibits an inverse relationship with magnitude of the gravity vectorSimilarly, multiple regression analysis was conducted for hypocotyls. Arabidopsis hypocotyls displayed significant effects from light (P < 2.2 × 10−16), genotype (P <0.05) and position (P < 4.9 × 10−5). However, no significant effect was detected for gravity (P = 0.055; Table S4). Not surprisingly, on Earth, the phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue-light phototropism shows a robust response immediately upon stimulation, followed by cessation once the hypocotyl reaches ~90° (Fig. 7). This same trend is also exhibited in hypocotyls of plants initially pretreated with red light and subsequent illuminated with blue light (Fig. 8). There is no significant gravity effect on the phototropic response in red light pretreated or blue light illuminated hypocotyls. In hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to red light, we observe a positive phototropic curvature in plants exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 9). Unlike hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to blue light, red-light exposure causes a steady positive phototropic response over time. However, similar to hypocotyls exposed to blue light, there is no significant effect of gravity on phototropic curvature. Fig. 7.

Positive phototropic response of shoots to blue light is not significantly affected by gravityFig. 8. Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to blue light preceded by a 1-h red pretreatment in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. Positive phototropic response of shoots to blue light is not enhanced by 1-h red-light pretreatmentFig. 9. Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experimentSeedling position within the cassette also was shown to have a significant effect on phototropic curvature in both hypocotyls and roots. This is likely due to the variation in light intensity experienced within the seedling cassettes. Blue-light intensity decreases significantly the further the plant is from the light (Suppl. Fig. S1) ranging from 41.5 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position furthest from the LED. A similar trend is seen in red-light intensity, with illumination ranging from 59.6 μmol m−2 s−1 of light nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 furthest from the LED (Suppl. Fig. S2). To study the effects of microgravity on overall growth, we measured root and shoot lengths during the period of photostimulation. ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test of root (Table 1) and shoot (Table 2) total growth indicate that there are no significant differences in growth between microgravity and 1-g treatments. In addition, Pearson’s correlations were conducted to determine if overall growth was significantly correlated with phototropic curvature of seedlings. The correlation between total root growth and rate of root curvature was not significant (r = 0.20, P = 0.14), suggesting no relationship between root growth and curvature. However, in hypocotyls, the correlation between shoot growth and curvature was significant (r = 0.31, P = 0.02), suggesting that total shoot growth has an impact on rate of shoot curvature.

During the TROPI-1 series of experiments, germination rates were severely hampered by excess stowage time (>8 months) of the seeds prior to the activation of the experiment in space (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). During TROPI-2, we found that reducing the stowage time of seeds (<3 months) resulted in a dramatic increase in seed germination (Kiss et al. 2009). In addition, it was discovered after the conclusion of the TROPI experiments that utilization of the EMCS’s two-rotor setup resulted in a slight light contamination between the two rotors, which may have caused non-unidirectional light sources (Kiss et al. 2014). The current seedling growth set of experiments were conducted utilizing a single rotor of the EMCS to remove the possibility of between-rotor light contamination and have been optimized in many other ways (Table 3). The large range in sample sizes (6–50) of the various conditions was a product of multiple factors. Due to limited space, the design of the experiment necessitated an unbalanced experimental design, where half as many plants were grown under blue light or were pretreated with red light. In addition, there was reduced germination during the second spaceflight experiment for the Ler WT and PhyA genotypes. The reduction in germination in likely due to the extended period of time the seeds remained in hardware prior to spaceflight, as germination counts during flight build were in excess of 85 % (data not shown). Reducing the time between hardware build and execution of the experiment can help to increase germination rates and to maximize scientific return of space-flight experiments.Phototropic responses in roots Under the conditions of microgravity, a novel positive blue-light phototropic response was observed in roots of seedlings (Figs. 3, 4). While blue-light-based negative phototropism in roots has been extensively characterized in ground studies (Correll and Kiss 2002), this positive phototropic response is greatly reduced at 0.1g, and effectively negated at 0.3g and higher gravity levels. To date, this phototropic response has not previously been observed in the roots of Arabidopsis. This observation suggests that positive phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots is masked by the much more robust gravitropic response in Earth normal conditions, and the response can only be observed when the gravity vector is greatly reduced or eliminated, as can be observed in space experiments in orbiting vehicles. Interestingly, the relationship between the blue-light-positive phototropic response and gravity appears to represent a threshold model, where gravity levels between 0g and 0.1g eliminate the blue positive phototropic response. Interestingly, the previous clinorotation studies conducted by our group did not demonstrate positive phototropic curvature of roots when exposed to blue light. This observation suggests that while informative and beneficial, clinorotation studies are not a perfect proxy for actual microgravity, and further highlights the need for true spaceflight experiments. In addition to the blue-light phototropic response, a 1-h red-light pretreatment, followed by continuous blue illumination was tested (Fig. 5). Similar to the blue-light exposure only phototropic response revealed in roots, red-light pretreated roots exhibited an immediate and robust response in the direction of the blue-light photostimulus. The magnitude of the total positive phototropic curvature was at least 25 % greater in roots exposed to red-light pretreatment compared with those exposed solely to blue light. These results are not unexpected, as the previous studies of Arabidopsis have shown that etiolated (dark-grown) seedlings exposed to red-light pretreatment experience an increase in the blue-light phototropic response (Sakai and Haga 2012; Goyal et al. 2013). In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that overhead pretreatment with blue-light illumination also enhances the phototropic response (Sullivan et al. 2016). It has been proposed that this effect is due to red, far red, and blue light all acting together as an activator of phytochrome A, which leads to enhancement of the phototropic response (Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004). However, it is interesting to note that we do not see a significant difference in phototropic response in phyA mutants when compared with the wild type. This observation suggests that phytochrome A does not contribute to enhancement of blue-light positive phototropic response in roots. In addition, there is no apparent effect of genotype on the overall magnitude of phototropic response of roots pretreated with red light. A similar attenuation of positive phototropic curvature at 0.1g is also exhibited under red-light pretreatment when compared with non-pretreated samples. Cessation of curvature appears as a similar thresholding response between 0g and 0.1g, which negates positive phototropic curvature in red-light pretreated samples. As noted in our previous space experiments (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012), plant roots exposed to illumination with red light also experienced positive phototropic curvature (Fig. 6). The positive phototropic response is confirmed and is similar to what has previously been characterized during the TROPI experiments, however, the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature is greater than in the previous results (Kiss et al. 2012). Interestingly, two distinctions exist when comparing the root phototropic response to red vs. blue light. First, the positive phototropic curvature in response to red light is not eliminated at the onset of gravitational acceleration. Rather, it appears that the rate of root positive phototropic curvature is inversely correlated with the magnitude of the gravity vector, with the largest magnitude of curvature being experienced in seedlings exposed to microgravity. Second, there appears to be a genotype-specific effect at low gravity conditions, where the WT shows much higher levels of positive phototropic curvature when compared with phytochrome mutant varieties. However, this genotype effect appears to be negated at gravity levels of 0.5g and greater. Comparison of the root phototropic responses to red light and blue light reveals unique patterns between the two treatments. Utilization of fractional or reduced gravity conditions allowed for the identification of gravity levels that correspond with an attenuation of response, which differed between the two light treatments. Interestingly, a threshold value of 0.1–0.3g is enough to cease phototropic curvature in roots illuminated with blue light; however, this same threshold is not observed in red light, which exhibits something akin to a gravity dose response. This difference in response suggests that the mechanisms controlling the interaction between gravitropic response and phototropic response are different for red and blue light. In addition, the enhancement of the blue-light phototropic response in roots after red-light pretreatment suggests that while the two responses differ in pattern and potentially, mechanisms, there is still an additive effect that causes an enhancement to total phototropic curvature. The notion of positive blue-light phototropism in roots tends to contradict the traditional understanding of phototropic function, where roots move in the opposite direction of blue light to grow deeper into soil. However, these observed differences in phototropism between 1g and μg in Arabidopsis may reflect the evolutionary history of plants. For instance, plants from older evolutionary lineages, such as mosses and ferns, have a very versatile directional response to both red and blue light (Kiss 1994; Wada 2007; Li and Mathews 2016). Thus, microgravity may reveal mechanisms of phototropism that are normally masked by Earth nominal gravity conditions. It is possible that the near-linear relationship between red-light phototropic response and gravity in roots is a result of cytosolic calcium ions which have been thought to play a key role in the transmission of gravity sensing (Poovaiah et al. 1987; Gilroy et al. 1993; Correll et al. 2013), potentially through regulating the distribution of auxin and auxin transporters within the root cells (Benjamins et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2011; Shih et al. 2015). A study conducted by Toyota et al. (2013) utilized parabolic flight to examine the effects of reduced gravity gradients on calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This study examined the gravitropic response to gravity vectors ranging from 0.5g to 2.0g and found intercellular Ca2+ signaling exhibits a near-linear relationship with gravistimulation. This linear relationship between gravity sensing and Ca2+ signaling is the inverse of the observed red-light-induced phototropic curvature in roots observed in our present study, suggesting a potential antagonistic relationship with the root red-light phototropic response mechanisms. A recent study also utilized parabolic flights to examine cytosolic calcium levels on Arabidopsis cell cultures (Neef et al. 2015). In addition, this report demonstrated a clear link between several known Ca2+ inhibitors/antagonists and changes in cytosolic calcium due to gravity. However, this study also identified a single Ca2+ (nifedipine) inhibitor that had no effect on calcium signaling, suggesting the possibility of unique calcium channels or pumps involved in gravity signaling. It is possible that a gradual reduction in cytosolic calcium levels is responsible for the decreased positive phototropic response associated with increasing gravity.Phototropic responses in hypocotyls As in ground studies, plant hypocotyls exposed to continuous blue-light illumination showed an immediate and robust positive phototropic response in the direction of the light stimulus, followed by continuous growth at 90° in the direction of the light source (Fig. 7). As expected, there is no statistically significant effect of genotype on the phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to blue light. Gravity also did not have a significant effect on the direction, response time, or magnitude of hypocotyl phototropic curvature in response to unidirectional blue-light illumination. However, we do see a significant statistical correlation between the distances of the seedling from the light source, and the rate of positive phototropic curvature. These results correspond to our previous characterization of blue-light phototropic response in hypocotyls, where no increase in curvature was observed when exposed to microgravity conditions (Kiss et al. 2012). Red-light pretreatment of seedlings exposed to blue light did not result in an observable increase in the rate of positive phototropic response, and the pattern of phototropic curvature mirrored those seedlings that were not exposed to red-light pretreatment (Fig. 8). Interestingly, a recent study found that curvature enhancements stemming from red- or blue-light pretreatments were affected by light intensity, where higher fluence rates of the directional light caused a reduction in phototropic curvature (Sullivan et al. 2016). It is possible that enhancement of phototropic curvature was not observed in this case due to fluence rates that were high enough to inhibit the enhancement of curvature. In addition, it is possible that due to the rapid phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue light, we were unable to capture differences in curvature rate from the frequency of images we obtained (every 30 min). Increasing the rate of image capture (e.g., every 5 min) would likely help to identify enhancements in phototropic curvature of hypocotyls pretreated with red light. Analyses of seedlings grown in microgravity conditions and exposed to red light (Fig. 9) have confirmed previously characterized positive phototropic curvature of Arabidopsis hypocotyls (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). This positive hypocotyl curvature was previously characterized during the TROPI experiment series, however, it must be noted that the magnitude of the positive phototropic curvatures is less than what was measured during TROPI-2 (Kiss et al. 2012). These results are similar in magnitude and in accordance with results obtained from the TROPI-1 experiment (Millar et al. 2010). These differences can likely be attributed to the light contamination between rotors in the earlier experiments (Kiss et al. 2014), as all other conditions within the experiment were unaltered. In addition, the magnitude of positive hypocotyl phototropism when exposed to red light does not appear to be contingent on the gravity vector, whereas the previous study found a significant difference in rates of phototropic curvature in hypocotyls exposed to low gravity (μg or 0.1g) versus more substantial gravity vectors (0.3g or 1g). Previously, positive phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to red light was shown to be enhanced in phyB mutants when compared with phyA and WT varieties (Kiss et al. 2012). However, as all three genotypes tested show positive phototropic responses that were not significantly different, these results were not reproduced in this study. Again, we attribute these differences to the fact that we have improved the experimental conditions in this report by eliminating the stray light between rotors in the current studies.Phototropic responses and illumination intensity Multiple regression analyses of phototropic curvature in both roots and shoots revealed position as a significant variable that predicts the rate of phototropic curvature. This effect is due to the observed differences in illumination across the membrane as the distance from the light source increases (Suppl. Fig. S1 and S2). Therefore, within a cassette where all seedlings are exposed to directional light for the same duration, seedlings furthest from the light source receive reduced fluency from the lights, and, in turn, exhibit reduced phototropic curvature. However, while the magnitude of curvature differed significantly across fluence rates, the overall proportional trend in curvature was conserved. The relationship between fluence rates and phototropic curvature is well characterized (Janoudi and Poff 1990; Sakai et al. 2001). Traditionally, illumination and curvature of hypocotyls follow the Bunsen-Roscoe law, where curvature is a product of illumination intensity and the duration of exposure (Bunsen and Roscoe 1863). However, the previous studies characterizing phototropic response have reported that this relationship ceases to be valid at illumination intensities of greater than 0.01 μmol m−2 (Janoudi and Poff 1990), well below the light intensity used in this study. In addition, illumination intensity has previously been shown to have no effect on phototropic curvature of hypocotyls of WT seedlings (Sakai et al. 2001). It also is possible that the significant effect of position on phototropic curvature is the result of the use of non-etiolated seedlings, which our previous spaceflight studies utilized.Conclusions In this study, we characterize a novel blue-light phototropism that is present in microgravity, but is attenuated at low (0.1–0.3g) gravity levels. One-hour red-light pre-treatment followed by blue-light illumination enhanced the rate of positive phototropic curvature in roots. In addition, positive phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red-light was observed; however, increasing levels of gravity causes a gradual reduction in the magnitude of curvature as opposed to the drastic cessation observed under blue-light exposure. The red-light phototropic response of hypocotyls in microgravity, which we have previously characterized, was also confirmed. In addition, the present report shows the value of repetition of space experiments as is usual in ground experiments (Kiss 2015). In the first experiments (TROPI-1 and TROPI-2), we encountered a number of technical issues and obstacles (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). In the more recent Seedling Growth experiments, we were able to solve the technical issues and overcome the limitations of the previous projects (Table 3; Kiss et al. 2014). Thus, in this better controlled light environment in the EMCS, we were able to make new discoveries on the positive phototropism of roots in response to blue light that has added to the previous reports of novel mechanisms of red-light sensing that has been revealed in microgravity. It is clear that effectively removing the ubiquitous gravity vector in spaceflight experiments allows researchers to better understand the myriad of phototropic responses in plants.Supplementary Material SuppFig1 MS926550-supplement-SuppFig1.tif (155KB, tif) SuppFig2 MS926550-supplement-SuppFig2.tif (149.8KB, tif) SuppTable1 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable1.tif (141.4KB, tif) SuppTable2 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable2.tif (146.5KB, tif) SuppTable3 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable3.tif (90.7KB, tif) SuppTable4 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable4.tif (89.3KB, tif) Acknowledgments Funding for this study was provided by NASA Grant NNX12A065G, and we would like to acknowledge the fine support of NASA’s Ames Research Center.

    "abstract": "Summary Discovering the adaptation mechanisms of plants to the space environment is essential for supporting human space exploration. Transcriptomic analyses allow the identification of adaptation response pathways by detecting changes in gene expression at the global genome level caused by the main factors of the space environment, namely altered gravity and cosmic radiation. This article reviews transcriptomic studies carried out from plants grown in spaceflights and in different ground-based microgravity simulators. Despite differences in plant growth conditions, these studies have shown that cell wall remodeling, oxidative stress, defense response, and photosynthesis are common altered processes in plants grown under spaceflight conditions. European scientists have significantly contributed to the acquisition of this knowledge, e.g., by showing the role of red light in the adaptation response of plants (EMCS experiments) and the mechanisms of cellular response and adaptation mostly affecting cell cycle regulation, using cell cultures in microgravity simulators.

    "introduction": "Introduction Space exploration is one of the most fascinating enterprises for humans. It is becoming increasingly evident that plants are an essential companion of humans in space exploration as a privileged source of high quality nutrients and oxygen as well as waste recycling systems, that is, as a key component of bioregenerative life support systems (Fu et al., 2016). Thus, the search for the most efficient way of cultivating plants in space, including the knowledge of the mechanisms of adaptation of plants to the space environment and the careful selection of plant species, varieties and genetic lines, are current major challenges of plant space research (Medina et al., 2021). The most difficult parameter to overcome in the space environment is altered gravity level, because all other parameters such as oxygen and nutrient levels, humidity, temperature, or light conditions can be adjusted. Only cosmic radiation represents a challenge comparable to gravity because of the lack of 100% effective protective shields. On the other hand, plants, like every organism on Earth, have evolved under a constant gravity level and its modification or absence may be a difficult challenge to overcome for an organism. There are different ways to study the effect of microgravity on an organism (Böhmer and Schleiff, 2019). Real microgravity research onboard the International Space Station (ISS) provides the most valuable information (Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016), but it involves high cost and the access to it is very limited. Compared to a typical ground experiment, which usually involves practically unlimited sample size and the necessary number of performing personnel, spaceflight research imposes major limitations, including the size of and access to experiment equipment and the availability of trained staff and supplies needed to perform the scientific work. Furthermore, there are significant technical challenges that need to be overcome in the design and development of the experimental hardware necessary to operate in low gravity conditions. Retrieval, processing and storage of biological samples need to be optimized, in some cases by developing complex and costly procedures. Despite all these constraints, six decades of research on the effects of long- and short-term missions to space have resulted in a consistent knowledge of many aspects of the impact of extraterrestrial factors, mainly exposure to microgravity, on biological systems. The story started with the sending to space of the first plant materials which were grown on unmanned vehicles. The Soviet Oasis 1 plant growth system, the first facility devoted to space plant research in history, was flown on the Cosmos 368 flight as early as 1970. Soon after, the facility was used by cosmonauts in the manned Salyut 1 mission in 1971 to grow different plant crop species. Since then, different plant cultivation experiments have been flown on crewed vehicles, including the Soviet/Russian Salyut and Mir, the American Shuttle, the Chinese Shenzou, and the ISS. Continuous subsystem improvements and increasing knowledge of plant responses to the spaceflight environment has led to the design of Veggie and the Advanced Plant Habitat, latest in the series of plant growth systems installed in the ISS (Ray et al., 2019; Zabel et al., 2016). All these steps were directed to achieve the main objective of spaceflight biology, which was to gain an understanding of adaptive processes triggered by terrestrial organisms when they are confronted with the novel space environment. The knowledge of the environmental limits of terrestrial biology in spaceflight is key to the design of successful space exploration strategies (Des Marais et al., 2008). During spaceflight, exposure to a novel environment, previously unknown for terrestrial organisms, causes them to modify their growth and development patterns to a greater or lesser extent. These patterns are characterized by certain gene expression profiles capable of guiding growth and ensuring survival. During spaceflight, some sets of genes that were repressed in other environmental conditions are expressed and some other sets of genes are repressed in an attempt to cope with the new environment and adapt, or acclimate, to it (Paul et al., 2012). This response is not unique to plants, but it is enhanced in these organisms by the great reserve of plasticity exhibited by plant genomes, that enables them to respond to unforeseen environmental conditions, such as gravity alteration (Medina et al., 2021). In general, this plasticity is necessary because of the sessile character of plants that immobilizes them to the ground and disables them to escape to another place if the environmental conditions became adverse. One of the sources of genome plasticity is gene redundancy, a feature much more extended in plants than in any other taxonomic group. Plants have undergone extensive duplications (up to four times) of large genomic regions, producing a large amount of duplicated genes (Wang et al., 2011). For example, multiple cyclins and CDKs involved in cell proliferation control exhibit redundant mechanisms for producing the same effect in cell cycle checkpoints (Francis, 2011). In addition to gene redundancy, quicker mechanisms like transposable elements or epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation operate under environmental stress (Lukens and Zhan, 2007). This article revises the results of some relevant experiments performed in the ISS during the last decade and the knowledge acquired from them in terms of changes in gene expression at the global genome level (space omics). These changes are related to the acclimation or adaptation of plants to survive, grow and develop under the altered gravity conditions of extraterrestrial environments, either the microgravity characterizing spaceflight, or the partial gravity levels that can be found in the Moon and Mars surfaces. Together with gravity, another environmental stimulus is analyzed extensively, which is light. Both gravity and light are responsible for the two main tropisms that drive plant growth, namely gravitropism and phototropism. The regulatory effects of light and gravity on plant growth are closely related. An outstanding recent example of this relationship is the light regulation of the expression of LAZY4, a gene that plays an important role in the gravitropic response of both shoots and roots (Yang et al., 2020). In addition, upregulation of genes involved in a fundamental light-dependent function, such as photosynthesis, has been found as a response to microgravity condition in spaceflight, and, interestingly, this response occurred in etiolated plants, in the absence of any light signal (Kruse et al., 2020). The question on whether the deleterious effects of altered gravity could be compensated by light, or not, is critical for the success of plant culture in future human settlements on other planets, but attention to other suboptimal environmental parameters that may be unavoidable in spaceflight as cosmic radiation or reduced access to water or gas exchange may be also evaluated. In that regard, this review pays particular attention and its organized by the hardware used in each experiment, being crucial to understand the differential results observed in the “habitats” provided for each facility, in terms of suboptimal environmental conditions and particularly light. The adaptive response to spaceflight environment of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under darkness condition (BRIC experiments) A series of experiments called “Biological Research in Canisters” (BRIC) were performed in the NASA BRIC hardware, which consists of a simple compartment (canister) holding six 60-mm Petri dishes in small subcompartments called PDFUs (Petri Dish Fixation Unit cassettes) (Table S1). The PDFUs allow the sample fixation inside using an actuator gun. The BRIC hardware was flown as nonpowered payload so the seedlings were grown in the dark for the experiment duration, although a further development called BRIC-LED was implemented, providing lighting capabilities. In particular, BRIC-16 consisted of three individual experiments performed by three research groups as part of the STS-131 mission on the Space Shuttle Discovery in 2010. All BRIC-16 flight samples were grown in darkness for 309 h (12 days and 21h) and then fixed in RNAlater in-orbit. The Ground Control were BRICs prepared identical to spaceflight samples housed in Orbital Environmental Simulator (OES) at the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL-KSC) with a 24-h delay to enable duplication of the environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration) collected by telemetry from the space shuttle (Johnson et al., 2017; Kwon et al., 2015; Paul et al., 2012) (Table 1).

(2021) GLDS-321 Open in a new tab Experiments performed in BRIC hardware, indicating the main characteristics of each of them: experimental conditions, genotype, fixation, tissue used to carry out the transcriptomic study, authors and the GeneLab Data Set (GLDS). See also Table S1The BRIC-16-DNA experiment (Impact of Spaceflight on Arabidopsis: Deep Sequencing and DNA Arrays as Collaborative Readouts of the Transcriptome of Arabidopsis Seedlings and Undifferentiated Cell in Space) disclosed that A. thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) seedlings grown in space change the expression of 300 genes with respect to ground control samples. Between the differentially genes expressed, genes upregulated are associated with pathogen response, wounding, drought stress and cold stress (generalized stress-response) and genes downregulated are transcription factors involved in cell wall metabolism and cell elongation and genes encoding proteins that function in calcium-mediated signaling (gravitropism). The authors suggest that both the gravity signaling system and the stress signaling related to wounding and pathogens converge in their responses involving the actin-based cytoskeletal network attached to plasma membrane and the cell wall. It is possible that any of these signaling mechanisms are balanced by the force of gravity. Hence, the absence of gravity may confound the signaling system, inducing inappropriate stress responses as a consequence (Paul et al., 2012). The transcriptional analysis of BRIC-16-Regulation experiment (Actin Regulation of Arabidopsis Root Growth and Orientation During Space Flight) showed that spaceflight conditions triggered the downregulation of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and oxidative stress in Col-0 seedlings. Most of these genes are expressed in root hairs (class III peroxidase genes) independently of actin pathways because they were also downregulated in the other Arabidopsis line included in this experiment, the act2-3mutant. These gene expression changes led to shorter root hairs in space-grown seedlings. It is unclear whether this effect was due to microgravity per se or it was a consequence of other spaceflight environmental conditions producing stress, such as hypoxia, which produces the same phenotypic effect. Actually, the BRIC hardware system has several limitations: One is that the seedlings grow confined in small sealed containers for extended periods of time, and other is the absence of orbit 1g control which makes it difficult to distinguish true microgravity effects from other secondary spaceflight effects (Kwon et al., 2015). BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton study (Investigations of the Plant Cytoskeleton in Microgravity with Gene Profiling and Cytochemistry) focused on gene expression changes in shoots of Ler-0 plants. The functional analysis showed that many upregulated transcripts in spaceflight conditions were implicated in metabolic process and transport. Most of these genes were localized in the extracellular matrix and involved in cell wall modification. On the other hand, and unlike the other two BRIC-16 experiments, the downregulated genes were often involved in stress response. This result was associated with the fact that the transcriptional analysis only included shoots. At the same time, an abundance of adventitious roots (immediately transport oxygen from the substrate to shoots) was observed in spaceflight seedlings, suggesting that roots may undergo greater hypoxic stress than shoots during spaceflight. Therefore, pooling all plant organs together for a single analysis could provide an incomplete picture. The BRIC-16 was a cluster of spaceflight experiments performed during the same space mission (STS-131) in the same hardware (Biological Research in Canister, BRIC) with the goal of studying the longer-term plant survival response in the spaceflight environment. Despite these common features, and even though transcripts within the same functional categories (stress response, defense, metabolic processes and cell wall modification) were found to be involved in the response in the different experiments, some differing results were obtained. These differences were associated to the specific experimental conditions of each one of the experiments: BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Regulation used the Col-0 ecotype as wild type whereas BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton used the Ler-0 ecotype; BRIC-16-Regulation and BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton growth media was half-strength MS salts and 1% (w/v) sucrose in agar, but BRIC-16-DNA used only half-strength MS salts in phytagel; BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Regulation used in microarray analysis RNA from entire seedlings whereas BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton used RNA from shoots only (Johnson et al., 2017). The mission SpaceX CRS-4, launched on September 21, 2014, carried a new BRIC experiment with the aim of dissecting plant stress responses and revealing novel pathways for these responses triggered in space. RNA sequencing after growing for 8 days on board the ISS allowed the comparison of the transcriptomes of four A. thaliana ecotypes (Col-0, Ws-2, Ler-0 and Cvi-0) with ground-based control (a duplicated set of BRICs transferred to the ISS Environmental Simulator-ISSES with a 48-h delay to the flight experiment) (Table 1). Cvi-0 seedlings were those with the highest number of genes with deregulated expression, followed by Col-0 and WS-2 plants. In contrast, the Ler-0 plants barely showed changes in the expression of their genes. Common in all ecotypes, transcripts from heat-shock proteins (chaperones) were upregulated, whereas peroxidase transcripts were downregulated in spaceflight (Choi et al., 2019). According to the authors, this shared induction of molecular chaperones may help to protect cellular machinery from oxidative stress potentially triggered by hardware-dependent hypoxic response. In fact, alterations in growth and molecular responses in seedlings grown in BRIC have been described, raising the possibility that this hardware may impose intrinsic stresses on the plants and cause a response in some genes unrelated with the spaceflight environment (Basu et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2017). The spaceflight ecotype-unique transcripts analysis showed that Cvi-0 was enriched in genes involved in light stress, kinase signaling and cell wall modification, Col-0 was enriched in transcripts related to cold and sugar response and, in Ws-2, enrichment in responses related to oxidative stress response was detected. Instead, Ler-0 also showed no significantly over-represented processes because of the small number of genes changing their expression. These results bring out significant differences between ecotype behavior, being Col-0 and Cvi-0 much more responsive to spaceflight conditions, whereas Ler-0 appeared to be relatively resistant to the same conditions, and therefore, highlighting the need to carefully consider the genetic background when comparing data sets and designing spaceflight experiments (Choi et al., 2019). Another experiment that used the BRIC hardware to quantify protein and transcript differential expression of 3-day-old, etiolated Col-0 seedlings grown aboard the ISS, was launched on January 10, 2015 (Space-X CRS-5). The simultaneous proteomic and transcriptomic analyses provided a more complete picture of plant response to spaceflight (Kruse et al., 2020). In addition to the ground control (at ISSES with 48-h delay), in this experiment, two additional analyses were performed to eliminate significant changes in the transcriptome and proteome of Arabidopsis seedlings that could be attributed to the hardware (Basu et al., 2017) or to the RNAlater preservative (Kruse et al., 2017) (Table 1). These studies revealed marked impacts on post- transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics and plastid gene transcription in the plants exposed to microgravity. The effects on microtubule dynamics (alpha tubulins) were explained as a relevant physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, because alpha tubulin has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing the structural integrity of cells in microgravity. A wide variety of plastid-localized and plastid-produced genes appeared differentially regulated in the flight samples, but they were not present in the proteomic data. This result was surprising because BRIC hardware prevents all light from reaching the plants, and it was interpreted as a wasteful effort to enhancing light signaling to compensate for the absence of gravity. In summary, the unified transcriptomic and proteomic analysis points out the regulation of specific elements of cell wall, microtubule synthesis and plastid transcripts production as three new targets to achieve optimal plant growth during future long-term spaceflight missions (Kruse et al., 2020). During SpaceX CRS-12 mission (launched August 14, 2017) transcriptional responses of Col-0 seedlings and seedlings with a compromised unfolded protein response (UPR) to spaceflight were examined with the objective of studying how this response, which is a signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental and cellular stresses, could coordinate gene expression reprogramming in spaceflight stress conditions. For this, the BRIC-PDFU sterile plant culture hardware was used to grow for 14 days Arabidopsis thaliana wildtype and mutants defective in one or more components of the UPR, namely the TFs bZIP28 and bZIP60 (single and double mutants: bzip28, bzip60 and bzip28 bzip60) and the ER-resident kinase/ribonuclease IRE1 (atire1). The transcriptomic results showed that growth in orbit substantially altered expression of thousands of genes associated with biological functions compared with ground control across all genotypes. Specifically, WT had the largest number of differentially expressed genes (1675 DEGs upregulated and 831 DEGs downregulated) and the bzip28 bzip60 mutant had the smallest number of DEGs (1293 upregulated and 562 downregulated). Among these DEGs, 34.8% (783/2249) of upregulated and 27.5% (335//1217) of downregulated overlapped across all genotypes whereas relatively smaller numbers of DEGs were found to be genotype-specific. Therefore, with the aim to gain more insights into the transcriptome changes caused by the absence of a correct UPR signaling under both ground and space flight conditions, the authors performed K-means clustering analysis on FPKM values for all DEGs. This analysis became clear that many of these spaceflight responsive genes were regulated uniquely in certain UPR mutants compared with WT in the ground control and that these variations in ground samples expression were largely muted by spaceflight. Therefore, a genotype-specific regulation in spaceflight condition was not observed. Overall, these results would suggest that the UPR does not have a broad involvement in the response to spaceflight but could play a partial role in regulating the transcriptional reprogramming in space compared with ground control. The reason could be that under space flight conditions many related stress-responsive genes were downregulated, being able to produce alternative signaling pathways, which repress the observed stress responses regulated by UPR (Angelos et al., 2021). The adaptive response to spaceflight environment of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under light conditions The TAGES (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System) flight experiment, constituted by several independent runs launched to the ISS (Run 1: STS-129 November 16, 2009. Run 2: STS-130 February 8, 2010. Run 3: STS-131 April 5, 2010) was conducted within the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System) hardware. This facility allowed to grow Arabidopsis seedlings on standard laboratory Petri plates and provided controlled lighting, temperature and air quality, and minimizing hardware-induced stress factors. In the three biological replicates, seedlings germinated, grew for 12 days and were harvested on orbit to RNAlater-filled KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs). After returning to Earth, they were dissected into roots, leaves and hypocotyls for transcriptomic analysis (microarray). Ground control experiments (one per biological replicate) were conducted using identical ABRS hardware housed in OES chamber programmed to ISS environmental conditions (Paul et al., 2013) (Table 2). The microarray analysis showed that only 480 genes were differentially expressed in spaceflight samples in any organ, but most of these genes were not coordinately expressed among organs (only 26 genes were common in roots, hypocotyls and leaves). Although each organ displayed unique patterns of gene expression in response to spaceflight, the genes were involved in the same functional processes: the down-regulated genes were largely associated with factors regulating cell elongation and hormone signal transduction and the up-regulated genes were closely associated with pathogen responses, wounding and cell wall remodeling. Based on the results obtained, the authors pointed out that spaceflight environments had become extremely well controlled, there hardly being hardware-dependent factors, as indicated by the low number of genes with deregulated expression (48). Therefore, leaves, roots, and hypocotyls engage different genes in response to the spaceflight environment, but utilize similar adaptive strategies, consisting of initiating cellular remodeling and maximizing other environmental cues (for example, light) in a morphological response which is essential to produce a correct growth and development (Paul et al., 2013).

See also Table S1The CARA experiment (Characterizing Arabidopsis Root Attractions, launched on SpaceX CRS-3, April 18th 2014) consisted of growing three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes (wild-types Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia-0 (Col-0) and phytochrome D mutant Col-0 PhyD (phyD)) on Phytagel plates for 11 days secured to a fabric support to the wall in the US lab of the ISS Destiny module. Some of them grew with the ambient light of ISS and some in the dark, wrapped in blackout cloth. After a growth period of 11 days, samples were harvested into KFTs containing RNAlater. A comparable set of plates, grown within the ISSES, monitoring temperature, CO2, relative humidity and light levels, with a delay of 24 h after the initiation of the spaceflight experiment, was the ground control (Paul et al., 2017) (Table 2). The transcriptome responses in the root tips, which was the unique tissue used, showed that differentially expressed genes unique to each genotype were more abundant than those shared with another genotype. Under light exposure, Col-0 showed the greatest number of genes differentially expressed in spaceflight (297), phyD changed the expression of 130 genes and in WS only 71 genes were deregulated. Furthermore, each genotype used almost completely different sets of genes to physiologically adapt to the environment of the ISS. If this differential gene expression is considered as a measure of the physiological adaptive response cost, the WS ecotype would be better adapted to spaceflight than Col-0, and phyD mutation would be considered as a spaceflight-adaptive mutation in Col-0 background, suggesting that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. In the dark, WS and Col-0 seedlings showed roughly the same number of differentially expressed genes (218 and 224, respectively) and phyD exhibited the fewest genes with differential expression (131) indicating that the light environment affects physiological adaptation to spaceflight, which implies that the local habitat can be another factor that can be manipulated to reduce this cost. In this space experiment, all three genotypes were developmentally comparable to the ground control plants and they were equally productive in terms of root length so that only coordinately expressed genes shared amongst the genotypes (18 genes in light and 11 in dark) were considered fundamentally required for physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis to spaceflight. Most of them were up-regulated genes associated with defense mechanisms or cell wall (Paul et al., 2017). The RNA sequencing data collected from root tissue of Col-0 and WS seedlings grown in APEX03-2 (Advanced Plant Experiment 03–2) space experiment was used to investigate the role of alternative splicing during spaceflight adaptation in plants because it was described that terrestrial plant stressors arise unique alternative splicing patterns. In APEX03-2 experiment, launched on SpaceX mission CRS-5 on 10 January 2015, the seedlings grew on Phytagel Petri dishes kept in vertical racks perpendicularly oriented to the light source within the Vegetable Production System (VPS/VEGGIE) on board the ISS. The ground control was carried out inside the VPS ground unit within the ISSES chamber at KSC with a 48-h delay (Beisel et al., 2019; Ferl and Paul, 2016) (Table 2). Opposite to the pattern observed for differentially expressed genes, the analysis of the alternative splicing showed that fewer genes undergo spaceflight-induced significant differential alternative splicing in the Col-0 ecotype background (27) as compared to WS (48), with only 5 overlapping genes between them (Paul et al., 2017). Moreover, gene ontology analysis did not reveal any obvious conclusions respect to the function or localization of the genes with alternative splicing during spaceflight exposure. Although the detection of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms in spaceflight samples, regarding abundance, types, and functional implications, is still pending further investigation, this study presented strong evidence that alternative splicing plays a role in the process of molecular adaptation to the spaceflight environment in plants (Beisel et al., 2019). The Advanced Plant Experiments 03–2 also studied the hypothesis that skewing pathways play a large role in spaceflight adaptation via cell wall remodeling. Differential gene expression profiles of two mutants, differing in their ecotype background, defective in two well-characterized genes which affect different skewing control pathways (spr1 and sku5) and their wild type controls (Col-0 and WS) were examined after growing for 4 and 8 days on ISS. SPIRAL1 plays a role in directional cell expansion by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics and spr1mutation results in axial rotation of cell files throughout the plant, which manifests in roots as skewing to the left. SKU5 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall and plasma membrane protein implicated in stress response signaling and sku5mutant exhibits rightward skewing (Table 2).Morphological data (angle between the root tip and the initial direction of root growth in the 4-day-old seedlings) showed that spr1 seedlings exhibited a consistent leftward skewing phenotype on Earth that was substantially enhanced by spaceflight. Instead, sku5mutant showed a prevention of skewing in spaceflight compared to the ground control. The root length was not altered in either mutant line by spaceflight. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that in spr1 seedlings the number of differential gene expression under spaceflight condition was less than in Col-0 seedlings. In addition, both lines differentially expressed fewer genes at the 8-day timepoint than at 4-day. In contrast, sku5 seedlings the spaceflight differentially expressed genes were five-fold and two-fold more than WS at 4 days and 8 days, respectively. Also, both genotypes increase in their deregulated genes between 4 and 8 days. Among genes that were upregulated in spaceflight for sku5 many were LEA (Late Embryogenesis abundant) family genes, associated with seed dormancy, negative regulation of post-embryonic development and ABA signaling to enhance stress resistance (osmotic, cold, and drought) through membrane stabilization, ROS sequestration and protein aggregation prevention. Moreover, processes involved with salt, ROS stress, and light responses were terms enriched significantly at 4 days and at 8 days and terms associated with cell wall remodeling and biosynthetic processes were overrepresented. The sku5 and spr1 different gene expression patterns, considering the number of differentially expressed genes and their fold-change levels as a measure of metabolic cost of adapting to environment, suggest that mutation of the SPR1 skewing pathway enhances spaceflight physiological adaptation and the SKU5 pathway plays a key role in adaptation to this environment. Furthermore, the fact that spr1 and sku5 root lengths are not altered by spaceflight, indicate that the effects of these mutations lie in processes directing morphology and structure and not in growth processes (Califar et al., 2020). WS seedlings grown in the spaceflight experiment APEX03-2 for 11 days with constant light were used for the determination of differential methylation of leaves and roots (bisulfite DNA sequencing) and differential gene expression (RNA sequencing) in response to spaceflight (Table 2). The authors expected to elucidate the role played by the epigenome in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. It is well documented that terrestrial biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen attack, salt, and drought stress, are elicitors of differential DNA methylation (Zhou et al., 2019). Many genes of the networks involved in the response to these stresses are differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight. The results indicated that although large scale alteration of the average methylation level was not detected in CG, CHG and CHH contexts between flight and ground DNA, thousands of specifically differentially methylated cytosines were discovered with clear organ-specific patterns. In roots, hypomethylated CHH sites predominated whereas leaves showed a predominance of hypermethylated CHH sites. In leaves, about one-fifth of the genes differentially expressed in response to spaceflight (143 out of 743) were also differentially methylated (DmC-DEG), but in roots the fraction was about one-third (75 differentially expressed genes, 21 of which were also differentially methylated). Gene ontology analysis detected stress response to abiotic stimulus, temperature, radiation, and light stimulus categories in roots. In leaves, the detected categories included response to stressors of temperature, radiation and light, plus chemical stress, oxidative stress and a response to oxygen-containing compounds. In addition, in leaves, a 46% of DmC-DEG set were associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results suggested that although DNA methylation may play a significant role in a portion of the genes regulated by spaceflight, it is clearly not the only factor in this regulation. Furthermore, ROS genes may play a unique role in the adaptation of plants to the spaceflight (Zhou et al., 2019). Furthermore, in “The Advanced Plant Experiment-04-Epigenetic Expression” experiment, launched on the SpaceX mission CRS-10 on 19 February 2017, two methylation mutant lines (met1-7 and elp2-5) were grown on the ISS to assess their response to spaceflight compared to that of wild type (Col-0). The plants grew in the Veggie hardware (both on the ISS and in the ISEES chamber) with constant light conditions for 11 days, before being fixed in RNAlater into KFTs. Once on Earth, leaf and root tissues were dissected and, from each sample, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed (Table 2). The two mutant lines are deficient in separate and distinct functions that affect methylation. MET1 (methyl transferase) is directly involved in the maintenance (particularly at CG sites) of cytosine methylation in Arabidopsis and is an enzyme that modifies the epigenome, as part of stress responses. ELP2 (Elongator Protein) interacts with components of the siRNA machinery inducing cytosine methylation by recruitment of the DNA methyl transferase DRM2 and is associated with terrestrial pathogen responses, playing a role in root development (Paul et al., 2021). The results reinforced that, in overall average, genome methylation is not a hallmark of spaceflight adaptation in wild type plants because, for Col-0 plants, the degree of the genome-wide methylation was not statistically significant between spaceflight and ground control samples. Instead, both elp2-5 and mit1-7 plants were generally hypermethylated in spaceflight environment compared to the ground control. Each of the mutant lines demonstrated a different pattern of organ-specific expression and methylation. In met1-7 plants, a large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes in leaves was observed (72 out of 226), whereas in elp2-5, the large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes (101 out of 120) was observed in roots, suggesting that MET1 plays a more important role in leaves and ELP2 in roots, in the process of physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The functional analysis showed that differential methylation took place in elp2-5 line, together with the expression of gene classes that were associated with the spaceflight response in previous experiments, such as, metabolic processes and defense, hormone, and hypoxic responses. Besides, these same spaceflight-associated processes were also among the primary classes enriched in the spaceflight acclimation of Col-0. Conversely, the mutant met1-7 line showed relatively few GO term enrichments, predominantly associated with signal transduction, as membrane transporters or transcriptional activators. These data suggest that met1-7 plants were better adapted to spaceflight than elp2-5plants, and that the response to spaceflight environment acts more directly through mechanisms regulated by ELP2 than through those regulated by MET1 (Paul et al., 2021). Epigenetic changes in Arabidopsis seedlings in response to spaceflight were studied by conducting a whole genome bisulfate sequencing to discover and qualitatively assess spaceflight-associated 5-methyl cytosine epigenetic modifications. In this experiment, 6- day-old Col-0 plants pre-cultured on ground were transferred to culture chambers aboard the Chinese recoverable scientific satellite SJ-10 (launched on April 6 and landed on April 18, 2016) and after grown up to 60 h (2.5 days) under microgravity conditions, seedlings were fixed with RNAlater using a canal system and pump support system included in the equipment. The results demonstrated that lower methylation levels in CHG, CHH, and CpG context tended to occur under microgravity conditions. The molecular function analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) showed that they correspond to genes involved especially in hormone signaling pathways including auxin, ABA, ethylene, and brassinosteroids, genes encoding transcription factors (TF) and genes associated with cell wall metabolism. In addition to methylation alterations at the gene level, transposon elements (TE) showed altered methylation levels during spaceflight. Overall, these results indicate that alterations in the methylation of auxin-related genes and cell wall may play important roles in plants adaptation to microgravity and DNA demethylation within TEs may cause transcriptional alterations in transposons during adaptation to spaceflight conditions (Xu et al., 2018). Contrary to previous experiments that focus on studying the early adaptation response to the space environment, two Chinese missions whose results have been recently published, have focused on studying gene expression changes in the reproductive stage of A. thaliana plants. Because successful completion of the plant seed-to-seed cycle was considered essential to support human life in long-term manned missions, the main objective of these two experiments was to examine how two different photoperiod conditions could affect flowering time under microgravity. (Wang et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). One of the experiments was carried out on board spacelab TG-2 (launched on September 15, 2016) in Plant Culture Box (PCB) hardware that controls the atmosphere, temperature, and hydrates the plants. Sterile seeds of WT (Col-0), pFT:GFP transgenic plants and ft-10 were set on the panel root module containing commercially available vermiculite and stored dry until their hydration. The plants germinated and grew at 21°C under short-day (SD, 8h light/16h dark) or under long-day (LD, 16h light/8h dark) for 48 days, when one of LD PCBs with Arabidopsis plants was taken out by an astronaut and fixed with the RNAlater solution for transcriptomics analysis (Table 2). The initiation of bolting (start of peduncle growth) was delayed under the LD condition on board spaceflight (42 days after sown in spaceflight and 25 days after sown on ground control). According to this result, FT expression occurred later under this light condition because in the ground control the GFP fluorescence reached peak levels at 22 days after sowing and in microgravity the fluorescence peak was reached at 43 days after sowing. The microarray analysis performed using the leaves of WT plants grown under LD revealed that 1793 genes were upregulated whereas there were 1669 downregulated genes in the spaceflight samples with respect to their corresponding ground control. Among the DEGs, 53 flowering genes were identified and classified according to their known or predicted function in the flowering regulation pathway. The data showed that FT expression was upregulated along with a few genes involved in photoperiodism and circadian clock whereas the expression of SOC1 decreased accompanied by the downregulation of key genes involved in the response to the photoperiod, circadian clock, vernalization, ambient temperature, gibberellins and aging. These results indicate for the first time that FT and SOC1 could be key genes for A. thaliana plants to integrate spaceflight condition stress signaling into flowering regulation pathways (Xie et al., 2022). The second experiment was carried out on the Chinese recoverable satellite SJ-10 (launched on April 6, 2016). The plant growth system used consisted of four growth compartments, illumination, photograph, air-flowing, heating, and humidity controlling system. The A. thaliana lines used were WT (Col-0) and transgenic plants (pHSP:FT, pHSP:GFP or FG) expressing FT together Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under control of a heat shock-inducible promoter (HSP17.4), by which it is possible to induce FT expression in-flight by heat shock treatment. The plants loaded in the growth chambers were germinated and grown in the root modules on ground under LD or SD conditions for 20 days, so they had about six to seven rosette leaves when the satellite was launched. After 12 days and 15 h in orbit, SJ-10 returned to Earth and 2 h after landing the plants were harvested and fixed with RNAlater solution (Table 2). As the images taken during the development of the experiment revealed, under the LD condition flowering occurred two days later in the space samples than in the ground controls for both the WT plants and the FG plants. In contrast, under the SD condition after heat shock treatment (37°C for 1h), in WT plants this delay was reduced to 1 day and in FG plants it disappeared, flowering both on ground and in space at 3 days. Microarray analysis was performed using the total RNA from leaves of WT and FG plants grown under LD and the SD in space and on ground, respectively. In the study of the categories of gene expression affected by spaceflight under different photoperiods, 4512 genes in WT and 4201 genes in FG response specifically to the LD or the SD (named \"daylength-related-sp\" or \"dl-sp\"). This higher number of “dl-sp” genes indicates that daylength is an important factor to regulate the response of plants to spaceflight. To further study response of plants to spaceflight after FT expression in the FG plants under the SD in comparison with WT plants, the authors compared the number of DEGs in response to spaceflight under the LD and the SD, respectively, among WT and FG samples. In these comparisons, they identified that 534 DEGS represented the group of genes in FG under the SD condition insensitive to spaceflight stress (unchanged in FG under the LD in space) and they were involved in cellular metabolic processes, as amino acid, amine, and oxoacid metabolic process. Conversely, the most sensitive genes to spaceflight in FG plants under the SD condition (was significantly altered only in this condition) were 467 DEGs, many of them related with abiotic stimulus response and post-translational protein modification. Finally, 251 DEGs with function in chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway and response to stimulus non-changed their expression in WT under SD. These transcriptomic results together with bolting times indicated that heat shock-induced FT expression in FG plants could be used as a gen switch for flowering induction in space, which could change the sensitivity to the abiotic stimulus and/or cellular metabolic processes and therefore, alter plant response to spaceflight (Wang et al., 2022). Gene expression changes in well-controlled environmental conditions including several light profiles and partial gravity levels (EMCS experiments) The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) was another hardware facility aboard ISS which was used to grow plants on space. It provided directional light with white LEDs, controlled environment conditions (temperature, humidity, CO2, O2 and ethylene concentration) and it was equipped with two centrifuges that allowed to incubate the samples at different levels of gravity, up to 2g. This allowed them to perform an on-board 1g control, and also to incubate the samples at the so-called “partial gravity levels”, lower than 1g, such as those characterizing the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. In the TROPI-2 experiment (launched on space shuttle mission STS-130 in February 2010) WT seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype were grown for 6 days within the EMCS, and they were photostimulated with blue or red light at seven gravitational acceleration levels (μg, 0.07g, 0.13g, 0.21g, 0.39g, 0.53g and 1g) for the last 48h of the growth period. For seedling growth, photostimulation and video recording, samples were contained in special cassettes equipped with a hydration mechanism remotely operated, blue, red and white LEDs, which were used instead of the EMCS lighting system, and an “anti-fog” device that prevented water condensation from the cassette window. After the photostimulation phase, a crew member transferred samples from the EMCS to the to the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS) facility for preservation until download. The ground control was performed in a laboratory incubator following the exact timeline and light treatments as the spaceflight experiment (Kiss et al., 2012). TROPI-2 experiment was a duplication of the original TROPI experiment after the problems experienced with the samples because of the presence of toxic volatile substances in the hardware (Table 3).

See also Table S1.The primary objectives of the TROPI-2 experiment were to study plant tropisms in spaceflight (interaction between gravitropic and phototropic signals) using images, but samples from this experiment were also used to perform transcriptome analyses with RNA was extracted from whole seedlings, with the purpose of maximizing the scientific returns of the spaceflight experiment. The comparison between all spaceflight samples, regardless of their gravity or light treatment, with the 1g ground samples, identified 280 genes that were differentially regulated. However, in the comparison of all g-treated spaceflight samples with microgravity samples, only 130 genes were identified as being differently regulated. From these genes, several of them were involved in cell polarity, cell defense or stress, and cell wall development. This result suggested that all of the spaceflight samples had a more similar environment because overall fewer number of genes were differentially expressed in the second comparison than in the first one, supporting the role that gravity plays in affecting these key developmental pathways, which were both represented in the two comparisons. In addition, as this hardware allowed performing a 1g-spaceflight control, these samples were compared with the 1g ground control. This resulted in a large number of genes differentially regulated (230), many of them implicated in cell-wall development, cell polarity and oxygen responses, among other categories. The fact that the 1g spaceflight versus 1g ground samples revealed many genes with deregulated expression could be because of spaceflight effects other than microgravity (vibration, radiation exposure, etc), emphasizing the need for tissue fixation on board the ISS and better environmental monitoring tools to improve ground experiments (Correll et al., 2013). The Seedling Growth project (SG) was another plant space experiment performed in EMCS hardware, which consisted of three phases, each performed in different spaceflights: SG1 (uploaded via SpaceX CRS-2 in March 2013), SG2 (uploaded via SpaceX CRS-4 in September 2014) and SG3 (uploaded via SpaceX CRS-11 in June 2017). The goal of this project was to unraveling the link between the two main environmental cues driving plant development (light and gravity) at reduced gravity levels. Specifically, the project aimed at exploring if, and to what extent, specific light conditions could be applied to overcome, or at least to mitigate the deleterious effects caused by the lack of gravity on plant growth and development, thus facilitating the adaptation of plants to the space environment (Table 3). Ler seedlings grew under 6 nominal gravity levels (μg, 0.09g or low gravity, 0.18g or Moon gravity, 0.36g or Mars gravity, 0.57g or reduced Earth gravity, and 1.0g) illuminated under white light for 96h (4 days) followed by 48h (2 days) of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light. The transcriptome analysis (RNAseq) of these samples revealed differential gene families affected and a clear difference in the intensity of the transcriptional response. At microgravity level photosynthesis, photosynthetic antenna proteins, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum were downregulated pathways. Nevertheless, only two pathways, ribosome synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation were found to be upregulated. These results suggested that a possible interplay between plant growth in microgravity and plastid function could exist (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). The analysis focused on partial gravity levels showed that as the gravity load increased the number of differentially expressed genes with respect to 1g control decreased, with a remarkable exception of the low gravity level (lower than 0.1g), which is the one that resulted in the highest number of deregulated genes. The DEG number was 296 in microgravity, 568 in low gravity, 123 in Moon gravity, 19 in Mars gravity and only 2 genes in reduced Earth gravity. In addition, the functional Gene Ontology (GO) analysis only identified enriched categories in μg, low-g and Moon g-level, which were clearly different with the increasing partial-g level. In microgravity, light and photosynthesis GO terms were enriched, whereas response to stress, response to chemicals, and response to hormones were enriched in low gravity and the more representative enrichment in Moon gravity was related to cell wall and membrane structure. The general stress response detected in low gravity level was explained as the consequence of competition between phototropism (blue light) and the weak gravitropism signal (0.09g) to be the fundamental cue for driving seedling growth and plant development, resulting in a stress for the plant. Instead, the existence of the gravitropic response along with blue light illumination seemed to be enough to restore a nearly normal transcriptional state, particularly at Mars gravity level (Herranz et al., 2019). The SG project also studied by transcriptomic changes the adaptive response of A. thaliana Col-0 seedlings grown at two nominal gravity levels (μg and Mars gravity level, or 0.3g). These samples were illuminated for 4 days in a long-day photoperiod (16h white light and 8h dark) and in the last 2 days of growth period half of them were photostimulated with red light and the other half were kept in darkness (Table 3). The results indicated that only in microgravity condition, both in darkness and under red light, elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression was observed, being probably associated with a disturbed retrograde and anterograde communication between these organelles and the nucleus. Furthermore, in this condition, genes involved in hormonal pathways that promote proliferation, such as auxin and cytokinin signal transduction, were activated. On the other hand, at Mars g-level genes of hormone pathways related with stress response (abscisic acid, ethylene and salicylic acid) were activated. Furthermore, upregulation of environmental acclimation-related transcriptions factors (WRKY and NACs families) was also observed, especially in samples grown at Mars gravity level and photostimulated with red light, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial gravity level are able to acclimate by modulating genome expression in routes activated to cope with space environment-associated stress (Villacampa et al., 2021). Under these same growing conditions, two knockout lines of nucleolin protein, nuc1-2 and nuc2-2, affecting the two variants of this gene in A. thaliana, were grown in the SG series spaceflight experiments. The use of the nucleolin mutants can significantly contribute to the knowledge of the plant response to spaceflight environment, because NUC1 protein occupies a central position in ribosome biogenesis regulation, a complex stress-sensitive process which has been found to be seriously altered under conditions of spaceflight. In addition, NUC1 gene expression is known to be upregulated by red light on Earth. In turn, NUC2 protein participates in the mechanisms of adaptive responses to different stresses. First, transcriptome analysis was performed only with ground control samples with the purpose of knowing the response of nucleolin mutants to different illumination conditions, namely red light and darkness (Table 3). Under red light photostimulation, ribosome biogenesis was the most significantly enriched category within the upregulated genes in nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2. On seedlings kept in darkness during the last 2 days of cultivation, gene categories mainly involved in processes of cell division appeared promoted, and gene categories mainly related to developmental processes were downregulated in nuc1-2 seedlings versus WT and nuc2-2 seedlings. All these results indicate that on Earth the partial capability of the NUC2 gene of replacing the functions of NUC1 gene in darkness, when this gene is not present, is enhanced by red light. Furthermore, this photoactivation induces in the nuc2-2mutant an increased expression of genes belonging to functional groups associated to stress response, which means that NUC2 protein has a greater capacity of response to environmental signals, such as illumination with red light, and therefore, nuc2-2 plants cannot develop a full response to this stimulus. The results of this work bring out, in space-omics spaceflight experiments, the need to pay special attention to the ground reference controls because identifying the genetic background in the this condition is essential before conclusions can be made on the spaceflight results (Manzano et al., 2020). The “Plant Signaling” experiment, also carried out in the EMCS (launched in July 2011 aboard STS-135), studied the transcriptional profiling of root samples exposed for 5 days under continuous light at microgravity or partial g (0.53g, 0.65g and 0.88g) (Table 3). The analysis identified 101 genes whose expression levels were associated with gravity dose following three different patterns: increase or decrease expression in response to increasing g levels (dose-dependent linear response), peak or dip at an intermediate g level (peak up or peak down response) and induced or repressed expression levels to a threshold g level (threshold response). In addition, the identification of the biological functions or pathways of these 101 fractional-g responsive genes showed that they were genes involved in transcription regulation, chaperone function, cell wall and defense response. All of these categories had been previously described as being responsive to the plant response to the space environment (Sheppard et al., 2021). Adaptive response to spaceflight environment of other plant species The molecular response to the long-term spaceflight environment of Mizuna plants was measured using genome-wide mRNA expression analysis (mRNAseq). Seeds of Brassica rapa var. nipposinica (Mizuna) were germinated and grown in Lada growth chambers aboard to Zvezda module of ISS. These chambers include a root module, leaf chamber and light module. After 27 days cultivation, the plants were harvested and stored at −80°C in the MELFI freezer. Once back on Earth, total RNA from leaves samples was extracted. The fresh weight and water content (spaceflight: 82.9g and 92.5%, ground control: 58.0g and 92.0%) showed that Mizuna plants grew as well or better under spaceflight environment than on the ground. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that in space-grown plants a total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative markers were upregulated more than two-fold, including the major ROS-scavenging enzymes: thioredoxin and glutaredoxin. In addition, two ROS-producing genes (NADPH oxidase genes: RbohD and RbohF) were upregulated 3-fold and 5.1-fold, respectively. These findings suggest that the Mizuna plants can acclimate to long-term exposure in the spaceflight environment by reprogramming ROS gene network expression, producing ROS to maintain the activation of ROS signal network to control the defense system with ROS-scavenging system (Sugimoto et al., 2014). Arabidopsis thaliana cell culture adaptive response to spaceflight environment (Table S2) Arabidopsis thaliana wild type semisolid callus cultures were exposed to spaceflight conditions for 5 days within the Simbox hardware on board the Chinese spacecraft Shenzhou 8 (launched on October 31, 2011). The Simbox incubator enabled sample cultivation at controlled temperatures (22–24°C) and humidity (30–40%) and provided 1g in-flight control by means of an integrated centrifuge. In addition, this hardware included a pump system for metabolic quenching of the samples by RNAlater injection. The ground control experiment started with a one-day delay into the Simbox duplicate, according to the position in the flight incubator and kept at 23°C (Fengler et al., 2015) (Table 4). The microarray analysis detected 298 genes with differential expression between sample groups flight space (FS) and in-flight centrifugation (FC) but the differences in expression were not statistically significant. This result could mean that 5 days are enough for the culture adaptation to the new situation (spaceflight). Thus, in order to identify processes which are specifically influenced by microgravity and could provide important information about the physiological needs after a few days in space, overrepresented processes that were identical in the comparisons between FS samples and two 1g controls (in-flight centrifugation or FG and ground static or GS) were analyzed. Among the genes with upregulated expression, some of them constitute the ribosomal complex within plastids, and some others were genes involved in electron transport chains located within mitochondria and representative for ATP biosynthesis. Among the downregulated genes the largest group was shown to code for HSPs. These results indicated that 5 days of exposure to microgravity did not cause detectable significant changes in gene expression, but caused an increased energy demand which should be taken into consideration when plants will be used as part of bioregenerative supports on long duration space missions. Finally, with the aim to separate responses to microgravity from those of non-microgravity-related spaceflight conditions, genes that were significantly altered within spaceflight samples (FS and FC) compared to the 1g ground control were studied. The majority of these genes were involved in the stress-induced antioxidant system, signaling chains, and defense-resistance response. The alteration of these processes was assumed as the effect of spaceflight-related environmental conditions, and especially, with the high radiation dose received by space samples (0.51 mSV/d), much more intense than terrestrial levels of radiation (1 to 2 mSV/a) (Fengler et al., 2015).

See also Table S2.The aforementioned BRIC-16-DNA experiment also included the transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana tissue culture cells (Paul et al., 2012)(Table 4). One of the most striking molecular differences observed was the significant increase in expression of most heat shock proteins (HSP) and heat shock factor (HSF) transcriptional activators genes in spaceflight non-differentiated tissue culture cells. Among these genes, the HsfA2 transcription factor which is involved in the late phases of heat stress response, and two of its targets: Hsp17.6A, that blocks protein aggregation, and Hsp101, that facilitates dissociation of already formed protein aggregates. In addition, the expression changes in these two HSP proteins, as markers of late stress response, were studied in parabolic flights (hypergravity and hypogravity alternation), in simulated microgravity (2D clinorotation) and in simulated hypergravity (centrifuge) by RT-qPCR. Among gravitational conditions examined, only 2D clinorotation induced the expression of both Hsp101 and HSP17.6A at the same levels as spaceflight. This fact suggests that hypergravity forces experienced at the space shuttle launch do not contribute to the elevated level of HSP transcripts in spaceflight samples. Therefore, a unique feature of microgravity engages HSPs as part of a later-phase adaptive response to spaceflight conditions, probably associated with the role played by them in cytoskeletal organization, preventing cytoskeletal scaffold collapse in a non-gravity environment (Zupanska et al., 2013). The Cellular Expression Logic, or CEL BRIC-17 experiment, was a modification of the previous Arabidopsis cell cultures experiment in BRIC-16. In this experiment, launched on SpaceX CRS-2 to the ISS on 1 March 2013, besides the WT cell line, two mutant lines were used: ARG1 KO and HSFA2 KO (Zupanska et al., 2017, 2019). The knockout line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 was selected for the role of this protein in gravisignaling, whereas the knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 was selected because this protein is a key regulator of the defense response, via HSP chaperone transcriptional activation, to several types of environmental stresses (Table 4). The transcriptome analysis, after 10 days on orbit, showed that both mutant cell lines used substantially more and different gene expression profiles to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state compared to WT cells. This observation led to conclude that a proficient spaceflight adaptation requires a functional HSF network and functional ARG1 protein. The functional gene categorization revealed that, although individual genes were different in each expression set, those genes were largely representative of the same biological processes, suggesting slightly different routes, which appeared to be utilized to converge on the same basic adaptive strategies. In addition, most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1- and HsfA2-dependent. Specifically, these genes were involved in cell wall remodeling, intracellular transport and starch biosynthesis, suggesting major and specific roles of these two proteins in the physiological spaceflight adaptation through these processes. Overall, this study showed up that the use of knockout lines greatly increases the list of genes that are necessary to adapt to and survive in the spaceflight environment. This amplifies the information that is necessary to learn on what biological processes are necessary and what genes are involved in these processes (Zupanska et al., 2017, 2019). Arabidopsis thaliana cell culture adaptive response to simulated space environments (Table S3) Cell cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana were exposed to partial-g forces (0.16g, 0.38g and 0.5g) for different times during parabolic flight (24 s, 33 s and 20 s) and clinostat experiments (5 min, 10 min and 30 min), in order to investigate gravity-dependent alterations in gene expression by whole-genome microarray analysis (Fengler et al., 2016) (Table 5). The results revealed that, in simulation by clinorotation, the least effects (the lowest number of differentially expressed genes at least 2-fold) were obtained after 30 min at 0.5g. Furthermore, the hierarchical clustering (Pearson`s Correlation Coefficient) suggested that, in the clinorotation experiment, gene expression was more affected by the exposure time than by the change in gravity, because 0.16g, 0.38g and 0.5g generated no separate cluster for a given time of exposure and, interestingly, under 30 min of exposure, all gravity levels clustered with 1g controls. Although the clustering illustrated a low similarity between real (parabolic flight) and simulated partial-g, the screening at the single gene level identified many common differentially expressed genes, mainly at 0.38g. Among them, genes coding for proteins involved in cell wall modifications, peroxidases, auxin-related proteins, transmembrane proteins and components of intracellular signaling chains like different protein kinases, transcription factors and phytohormone-related proteins were identified. Taken together this study suggests that, after 30 min of clinorotation, specific responses are fading, demonstrating the insusceptibility of cell cultures over time and that clinorotation can induce changes in levels of transcripts similar to flight experiments (Fengler et al., 2016).

See also Table S3.In another work, callus semi-solid cultures of A. thaliana, prepared from MM2d suspension cultures, were exposed for 200 min to two paradigms of simulated microgravity (a mechanical one, the Random Positioning Machine (RPM) and diamagnetic levitation) and hypergravity (the Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC)). Five environments with different levels of effective gravity (g) and magnetic field (B) strengths within a magnet (μg ∗B = 10.1 T, 0,1g∗ B = 14.7 T, 1g∗ B = 16.5 T, 1.9g∗ B = 14.7 T and 2g∗ B = 10.1 T) and samples exposed to RPM simulated microgravity (μg) and hypergravity (2g) in the Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC) were compared (Manzano et al., 2012) (Table 5). The effects on the overall transcriptional state of callus exposed to these altered gravitational environments were studied. Microarray analysis indicated that barely a few genes were differentially expressed (not reaching statistical significance) when exposed to these unusual environments compared with internal 1g controls (particularly because of the large effect of high-energy magnetic field). However, using a detailed analysis based on clustering of similarly expressed genes (Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector-GEDI) it was found that gravitational and magnetic fields had a synergistic effect on the transcriptional profile because both the number of altered genes and the GO groups affected increased when a magnetic field gradient was applied, mainly affecting structural, abiotic stress and secondary metabolism genes. In fact, it is the first study in which a 0.1g partial gravity samples show larger effects that those observed in the equivalent simulated microgravity sample under the same environmental condition. The GEDI analysis also revealed that, there is a global signature, specifically including abiotic stress genes, that behave in an opposite manner under micro and hypergravity environments (Manzano et al., 2012). Plant cell proliferation is a process known to be affected during spaceflight, but the molecular mechanisms involved in these changes remain unclear. To investigate transcriptomic changes in cell cycle regulation and progression by simulated microgravity, an Arabidopsis immobilized suspension culture was incubated in the RPM. Particularly, the analysis was performed with two synchronous subpopulations, enriched in G2/M and G1 phases, incubated for respectively 7 h and 14 h within the RPM, and an asynchronous reference cell culture incubated for 14h (Kamal et al., 2019) (Table 5). The results showed that the number of differentially expressed genes common in all populations by the simulated microgravity environment was low: 73 genes were upregulated, mostly being NADH/oxidative activity-related genes and mitochondria-related functions, and 83 genes were downregulated, most of them involved in ribosome activity and in photosynthesis-related functions. Conversely, simulated microgravity had differential effects on gene expression through the cell cycle progression. The expression of genes related to cell cycle regulation function, cell organization, ribosome biogenesis and developmental processes were downregulated in the G2/M population and upregulated in the G1 population, whereas abiotic stress response genes were upregulated in the G2/M population and downregulated significantly in the G1 population. Among the genes involved in abiotic stress response, genes that respond to UV-B, heat, osmotic shock and wounding are upregulated in synchronous G2/M population, but they were repressed in the synchronous G1 culture after 14 h of incubation in the RPM. These differential patterns of gene expression of stress pathways suggest differential sensitivity to microgravity of different phases of the cell cycle. It was proposed that a rapid initial response to a new environment within the first 7 h occurs mainly through the activation of expression of stress-related genes, whereas, at 14h of incubation, the gene expression patterns change as a result of a longer-term adaptive strategy that inhibits those pathways (Kamal et al., 2019). Adaptive response to spaceflight environment of cell cultures from other species Ceratopteris richardii spores were exposed to microgravity aboard NASA shuttle flight STS-93 to identify the early cellular and molecular events associated with gravity signal perception and response. These fern single-cells have been particularly valuable for investigating how cells sense and respond to gravity because this signal orients the polarity of their development shortly after light initiates their germination. The spores remained dormant in darkness inside BRIC canisters until the gravity force was less than 0.001g, and then were exposed to ambient light in the mid-deck to induce germination. After light exposure at three developmental time points (1 h, 8 h and 20 h) spores were frozen in a gaseous nitrogen freezer and were kept frozen until total RNA was isolated (Table 4). Microarray analysis showed that genes likely to encode peroxidases are downregulated in spaceflight development whereas protein phosphatase 2C and chaperone expression were upregulated in spores during the first 20 h of their germination in microgravity. Moreover, genes that may be involved in mobilization of reserve lipids were upregulated in spaceflight and genes whose products are likely involved in lipid hydrolysis/synthesis/transfer showed reduced mRNA levels during development in microgravity. These results, taken together, suggest that in microgravity lipids utilization and stress response changes occur in ferns and may be common features of spaceflight response in plant cells. Moreover, these findings provided new insights into early physiological responses to microgravity and are valuable data unraveling the basis genetic mechanisms that drive single-cell gravity responses (Salmi and Roux, 2008). The spaceship Shenzhou mission also included one experiment to study gene expression in rice calli in response to microgravity. Rice calli (Oryza sativa) were loaded onto the stationary and rotating platforms of Simbox incubator and were fixed in RNAlater in space after 324h (13,5 days) spacecraft flight (Table 4). The functional analysis identified that the microgravity-response transcripts were associated with metabolism and signaling pathways of hormones, transcription factors, starch, glycolysis and the electron chain, protein degradation, transporters and cell wall metabolism. Among cell wall-related genes, genes related to cell wall formation/degradation were downregulated and transcripts corresponded to proteins involved in primary cell wall modification were upregulated. In addition, genes of the aquaporin family (water channels) were upregulated in spaceflight environment. The changed levels of these cell wall loosening and cell wall precursor synthesis-related genes together with aquaporin genes may establish of a new balance between cell wall rigidity and cell turgor pressure under microgravity conditions. Therefore, cell wall relaxation and extension may be regarded as microgravity plants adaptation (Jin et al., 2018).",

    "discussion": "Discussion and conclusions In the last decade, the landscape of plant biology research in spaceflight and simulated microgravity research has greatly advanced, mostly with the incorporation of space transcriptomics tools such as RNAseq and microarrays. The aim of this review was therefore to revise the knowledge acquired through these techniques. The focus and organization of the work around the hardware used in the various experiments facilitated the comparison of the numerous results obtained and made it possible the identification of gene expression networks leading to a better knowledge of the plant adaptation mechanisms to spaceflight conditions. The report also highlighted the European contribution in the acquisition of this knowledge. Even considering that novel experimental approaches take more time to be incorporated to space research than to general life science research on ground because of obvious and specific constraints of spaceflight experiments, these technologies have provided more than 25 datasets deposited in GeneLab database (Tables S1, S2 y S3). In that regard, Figure 1 illustrates the type of studies performed at the international level, arranged according to the materials and facilities used. The European contribution to the global plant biology experimentation is modest in the global numbers (8 of 30 studies) but particular contributions have been made in key topics. An example is the European co-leadership of the largest plant experiment carried out on board the ISS, using the most sophisticated hardware, that is the EMCS, including lighting at different wavelengths, partial-g and 1g, and environmental controls (Herranz et al., 2019; Vandenbrink et al., 2019; Villacampa et al., 2021). Also, there is a key contribution of European teams in simulated microgravity facilities and the use of cell cultures to uncover fundamental mechanisms discriminating the professional response to the lack of gravity from the purely cellular response and adaptive mechanisms. It is particularly relevant to realize that a small number of cell-based studies in simulators may have contributed to our understanding of these mechanisms more significantly than some spaceflight missions. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Distribution of Plant Space Omics contributions submitted to the GeneLab database Most European contributions (in bold) have been done using cell culture experiments in simulated microgravity facilities (10% of the experiments) and the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) into the ISS (17% of the experiments). Other facilities frequently used in spaceflight experiments are the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware and the VPS-VEGGIE cultivation chamber. At the top and the bottom part of the figure, images of some of the different facilities used are shown. From left to right and from top to bottom: Random Positioning Machine (credit ESA), Magnetic Levitation Instrument (credit Nottingham University) BRIC (credit NASA), Large Diameter Centrifuge (credit ESA), EMCS (credit ESA/NASA) and VEGGIE (credit NASA). There is a clear dominance by number of studies in the use of BRIC hardware by NASA researchers (20% of the studies). This experimental hardware facilitates a large number of experiments to be quickly performed in orbit, but it shows serious limitations as to the environmental conditions that can be controlled and monitored. Indeed, the absence of a 1g control in space does not allow to discriminate between alterations caused by microgravity and other environmental factors such as hypoxia or a reduced confined space, which does not allow the cultivation of plants in good conditions over a period of time longer than a few days. For example, in the BRIC-16 experiments, the cytoskeleton was clearly shown to have a key role in the response of plants to spaceflight stresses, but it was not clear whether this response was a consequence of adaptation to the absence of gravity, or to another environmental factor independent of microgravity, such as hypoxia (Kwon et al., 2015). Other facilities with better control of the environmental conditions (ABRS and VPS/VEGGIE), particularly those including a 1g control on board (EMCS and Simbox harware), lead to more sophisticated results. In fact, the presence of a centrifuge on board not only makes it possible to obtain 1g control in space, and thus to discriminate the responses of plants because of the absence of gravity from other environmental factors, but it also makes it possible to obtain partial gravity levels such as that of the Moon (0.18g) and that of Mars (0.36g), which is essential for preparing future missions to the Moon and Mars. Improvements in cultivation constraints, optimization of controls and the systematic use of the model plant A. thaliana have allowed a great advance in the acquisition and comparison of results. It should be noted, however, that restoring terrestrial gravity or partial gravity such as that of Mars or the Moon on a centrifuge may induce experimental biases that have not yet been evaluated at the cellular scale. For example, the rotation may introduce vibrations to which the cells may respond independently of the level of gravity and the centrifugal forces are not applied homogeneously on a culture surface, but rather they are applied according to a gradient that is defined from the axis of rotation, which may be a source of some heterogeneity in the study population. Despite the limitations in interpreting the results because of different experimental constraints, our knowledge of the adaptive response to spaceflight environment of A. thaliana seedlings has unequivocally advanced. Transcriptomic analysis techniques (RNAseq and microarray) as well as the consensual use of the model species A. thaliana allowed us to highlight common response pathways in the majority of the experiments carried out on board the ISS. Thus, the main processes affected identified in these studies were cell wall remodeling, oxidative stress, defense reaction, HSPs, and photosynthesis. Consequently, we are in conditions of identifying some mechanisms of adaptation of plants to microgravity, based on similar gene expression profiles obtained in different experiments (Figure 2). The absence of gravity is perceived by the plant as a stress factor, which will trigger a whole series of adaptation reactions of the plant to this new environmental factor. Some of these reactions seem to be specifically targeted in the maintenance of cell integrity, such as cell wall remodeling, whereas others affect plant metabolism, such as photosynthesis, the electron transfer chain in mitochondria, and the communication between nuclei, plastids, and mitochondria. Finally, other reactions are systematically triggered by many biotic and abiotic stresses, such as oxidative stress, defense reactions and HSPs (chaperone proteins). Although the link between all responses has yet to be determined, it is clear that all of them play an essential role in the adaptation of plants to the space environment, becoming key targets for optimal growth plants to support future long-term spaceflight missions. (Figure 3). Figure 2. Open in a new tab The main spaceflight-related genes Transcriptomic analyses of the numerous space experiments have so far identified a set of genes whose expression is altered by the spaceflight environment in a similar way among the different experiments. The genes were grouped according to the function of their proteins. (N) nucleus, (P) plastid, (M) mitochondria, (PR protein) pathogenesis related protein, (ROS) reactive oxygen species, (HSF) heat shock factor, (HSP) heat shock protein. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Proposed model of the microgravity adaptation mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana Microgravity is perceived by the plant as an abiotic stress factor which activates the production of ROS. The signal, which is perceived at the plasma membrane, is then transmitted via Ca2+, MAPKs and phytohormones (auxin) to the nucleus where it triggers TFs like HSF. The TFs then regulate the expression of a set of genes that trigger molecular, cellular and physiological responses, leading to the establishment of the plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment. (ROS) reactive oxygen species, (TFs) transcription factors, (HSF) heat shock factor, (HSP) heat shock protein. Other molecular processes involved in the response to different environmental stress factors on Earth, such as DNA methylation and alternative splicing, seem to be also involved in this adaptation response, as the first transcriptomics studies of these two processes have revealed (Beisel et al., 2019; Paul et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019). However, different responses or even contradictory results depending on the environmental conditions have also been found between the different experiments (Johnson et al., 2017), strongly suggesting that the adaptive mechanisms, as a whole, should be more complex than these observed responses alone. In fact, the large number of different ecotypes and mutants used in the different experiments have shown that the response between the Arabidopsis ecotypes used is very different, some of them showing a greater capacity to adapt to the space environment or with less cost by changing the expression of a low number of genes, as it happens to Ler. (Choi et al., 2019; Paul et al., 2017). The mutant lines in different genes involved in various processes such as skewing, DNA methylation and UPR (Angelos et al., 2021; Califar et al., 2020; Paul et al., 2021) have provided more detailed information about the role that these processes play in the adaptation of plants to a space flight environment. In addition, differences between the genes whose expression is altered have been found between the different organs of the plant (Paul et al., 2013). Both findings indicate that the genetic background is an aspect to take into account to choice of the most suitable crop plant models and that knowing the integrated response of all parts of the plant will be crucial for the next phase of spaceflight experimentation. Light, as the results of the different experiments demonstrate, is an essential factor in all plant development stages under spaceflight environment. The light quality, and specifically red light in the early stages of development (seedlings), modulates the expression of genes involved in related-stress pathways to cope with environmental spaceflight conditions (Villacampa et al., 2021). In addition, the day length is a factor that can regulate the plants flowering time, and it is even possible to use a genetic switch to induce flowering by adding a treatment, such as a heat shock (Wang et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). Furthermore, it has been shown that the adaptive response of plants depends on both the level of gravity (Herranz et al., 2019; Sheppard et al., 2021)) and the time of exposure to the spatial environment (Fengler et al., 2015; Kamal et al., 2019)). In fact, an early and a late response can be identified in the adaptive response of plant cell cultures grown in simulated microgravity (Kamal et al., 2019). ROS production was also demonstrated in other members of the Brassicaceae family, such as Mizuma (Brassica rapa) and parietal changes were observed in rice (Oryza sativa), confirming the key role of these two cellular processes in the adaptation processes of plants to microgravity. Finally, we consider it necessary to recapitulate why this research is actually important and worth to be performed. As previously indicated, studying the adaptation of plants to the space environment is an essential step towards successfully integrating plants into life support systems. During spaceflight, plants will have to adapt to a new environment where factors such as micro- and mini-gravity (gravities of spaceflight, the Moon and Mars) and chronic low-level cosmic radiation are completely new to them. In that regard, experiments introducing partial gravity levels, and particularly the levels around the Moon gravity, are becoming mandatory. A potential risk in using low gravity levels (circa 0.1g) with more deleterious effects than microgravity itself have been revealed (Herranz et al., 2019; Manzano et al., 2018), and the decommissioning of EMCS in 2018 from the ISS made us less able to provide new experiments at those conditions. In this field, transcriptomic studies are a privileged strategy because they allow an analysis of gene expression in its entirety, leading to the identification of response pathways that would not be detected by more targeted approaches (Lowe et al., 2017). They also have the advantage of requiring only a relatively small quantity of transcripts (1 ng of total RNA for RNAseq and 1 μg of mRNA for microarray), which is a major advantage in the context of space experiments where the quantity of biological material is always very limited. In contrast, there are two potential caveats to the advance of the research field. The first is the uneven distribution of spaceflight opportunities in space agencies, particularly the unavailability of ESA to provide a replacement with similar capabilities to EMCS. The second is the analysis and integration of results from so different experiment platforms, materials and designs. New international consortia have been created to cope with better tools for transcriptomic analyses, improvement to the access of datasets and metadata, contributing decisively to the optimization of the new experiments to be conducted in the near future. GeneLab (Overbey et al., 2021), TOAST (Barker et al., 2020), ESA Space Omics TT (Madrigal et al., 2020) and ISSOP (Rutter et al., 2020) are highly relevant initiatives in this direction. Limitations of the study The transcriptomic studies included in this review focus on the search carried out mainly in GeneLab Data Repository and despite the fact that the GLDS data set includes an interface to search datasets on key repositories ( GEO, EBI PRIDE, and ANLMG-RAST), some work focused on transcriptomic changes produced by a space environment might not have been included. Methods details To locate the works that study the plants adaptive response to a real or simulated space environment through transcriptomic analysis, NASA GeneLab data repository has been used as a reference (https://genelab.nasa.gov/). To perform an exhaustive search, the word ‘plants’ was used as a filter in the search data box and the total results were checked one by one to confirm that the publication includes and meets the criteria.

Copyright notice ID: 9287483 PMID: 35856037 Summary Discovering the adaptation mechanisms of plants to the space environment is essential for supporting human space exploration. Transcriptomic analyses allow the identification of adaptation response pathways by detecting changes in gene expression at the global genome level caused by the main factors of the space environment, namely altered gravity and cosmic radiation. This article reviews transcriptomic studies carried out from plants grown in spaceflights and in different ground-based microgravity simulators. Despite differences in plant growth conditions, these studies have shown that cell wall remodeling, oxidative stress, defense response, and photosynthesis are common altered processes in plants grown under spaceflight conditions. European scientists have significantly contributed to the acquisition of this knowledge, e.g., by showing the role of red light in the adaptation response of plants (EMCS experiments) and the mechanisms of cellular response and adaptation mostly affecting cell cycle regulation, using cell cultures in microgravity simulators.

It is becoming increasingly evident that plants are an essential companion of humans in space exploration as a privileged source of high quality nutrients and oxygen as well as waste recycling systems, that is, as a key component of bioregenerative life support systems (Fu et al., 2016). Thus, the search for the most efficient way of cultivating plants in space, including the knowledge of the mechanisms of adaptation of plants to the space environment and the careful selection of plant species, varieties and genetic lines, are current major challenges of plant space research (Medina et al., 2021). The most difficult parameter to overcome in the space environment is altered gravity level, because all other parameters such as oxygen and nutrient levels, humidity, temperature, or light conditions can be adjusted. Only cosmic radiation represents a challenge comparable to gravity because of the lack of 100% effective protective shields. On the other hand, plants, like every organism on Earth, have evolved under a constant gravity level and its modification or absence may be a difficult challenge to overcome for an organism. There are different ways to study the effect of microgravity on an organism (Böhmer and Schleiff, 2019). Real microgravity research onboard the International Space Station (ISS) provides the most valuable information (Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016), but it involves high cost and the access to it is very limited. Compared to a typical ground experiment, which usually involves practically unlimited sample size and the necessary number of performing personnel, spaceflight research imposes major limitations, including the size of and access to experiment equipment and the availability of trained staff and supplies needed to perform the scientific work. Furthermore, there are significant technical challenges that need to be overcome in the design and development of the experimental hardware necessary to operate in low gravity conditions. Retrieval, processing and storage of biological samples need to be optimized, in some cases by developing complex and costly procedures. Despite all these constraints, six decades of research on the effects of long- and short-term missions to space have resulted in a consistent knowledge of many aspects of the impact of extraterrestrial factors, mainly exposure to microgravity, on biological systems. The story started with the sending to space of the first plant materials which were grown on unmanned vehicles. The Soviet Oasis 1 plant growth system, the first facility devoted to space plant research in history, was flown on the Cosmos 368 flight as early as 1970. Soon after, the facility was used by cosmonauts in the manned Salyut 1 mission in 1971 to grow different plant crop species. Since then, different plant cultivation experiments have been flown on crewed vehicles, including the Soviet/Russian Salyut and Mir, the American Shuttle, the Chinese Shenzou, and the ISS. Continuous subsystem improvements and increasing knowledge of plant responses to the spaceflight environment has led to the design of Veggie and the Advanced Plant Habitat, latest in the series of plant growth systems installed in the ISS (Ray et al., 2019; Zabel et al., 2016). All these steps were directed to achieve the main objective of spaceflight biology, which was to gain an understanding of adaptive processes triggered by terrestrial organisms when they are confronted with the novel space environment. The knowledge of the environmental limits of terrestrial biology in spaceflight is key to the design of successful space exploration strategies (Des Marais et al., 2008). During spaceflight, exposure to a novel environment, previously unknown for terrestrial organisms, causes them to modify their growth and development patterns to a greater or lesser extent. These patterns are characterized by certain gene expression profiles capable of guiding growth and ensuring survival. During spaceflight, some sets of genes that were repressed in other environmental conditions are expressed and some other sets of genes are repressed in an attempt to cope with the new environment and adapt, or acclimate, to it (Paul et al., 2012). This response is not unique to plants, but it is enhanced in these organisms by the great reserve of plasticity exhibited by plant genomes, that enables them to respond to unforeseen environmental conditions, such as gravity alteration (Medina et al., 2021). In general, this plasticity is necessary because of the sessile character of plants that immobilizes them to the ground and disables them to escape to another place if the environmental conditions became adverse. One of the sources of genome plasticity is gene redundancy, a feature much more extended in plants than in any other taxonomic group. Plants have undergone extensive duplications (up to four times) of large genomic regions, producing a large amount of duplicated genes (Wang et al., 2011). For example, multiple cyclins and CDKs involved in cell proliferation control exhibit redundant mechanisms for producing the same effect in cell cycle checkpoints (Francis, 2011). In addition to gene redundancy, quicker mechanisms like transposable elements or epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation operate under environmental stress (Lukens and Zhan, 2007). This article revises the results of some relevant experiments performed in the ISS during the last decade and the knowledge acquired from them in terms of changes in gene expression at the global genome level (space omics). These changes are related to the acclimation or adaptation of plants to survive, grow and develop under the altered gravity conditions of extraterrestrial environments, either the microgravity characterizing spaceflight, or the partial gravity levels that can be found in the Moon and Mars surfaces. Together with gravity, another environmental stimulus is analyzed extensively, which is light. Both gravity and light are responsible for the two main tropisms that drive plant growth, namely gravitropism and phototropism. The regulatory effects of light and gravity on plant growth are closely related. An outstanding recent example of this relationship is the light regulation of the expression of LAZY4, a gene that plays an important role in the gravitropic response of both shoots and roots (Yang et al., 2020). In addition, upregulation of genes involved in a fundamental light-dependent function, such as photosynthesis, has been found as a response to microgravity condition in spaceflight, and, interestingly, this response occurred in etiolated plants, in the absence of any light signal (Kruse et al., 2020). The question on whether the deleterious effects of altered gravity could be compensated by light, or not, is critical for the success of plant culture in future human settlements on other planets, but attention to other suboptimal environmental parameters that may be unavoidable in spaceflight as cosmic radiation or reduced access to water or gas exchange may be also evaluated. In that regard, this review pays particular attention and its organized by the hardware used in each experiment, being crucial to understand the differential results observed in the “habitats” provided for each facility, in terms of suboptimal environmental conditions and particularly light. The adaptive response to spaceflight environment of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under darkness condition (BRIC experiments) A series of experiments called “Biological Research in Canisters” (BRIC) were performed in the NASA BRIC hardware, which consists of a simple compartment (canister) holding six 60-mm Petri dishes in small subcompartments called PDFUs (Petri Dish Fixation Unit cassettes) (Table S1). The PDFUs allow the sample fixation inside using an actuator gun. The BRIC hardware was flown as nonpowered payload so the seedlings were grown in the dark for the experiment duration, although a further development called BRIC-LED was implemented, providing lighting capabilities. In particular, BRIC-16 consisted of three individual experiments performed by three research groups as part of the STS-131 mission on the Space Shuttle Discovery in 2010. All BRIC-16 flight samples were grown in darkness for 309 h (12 days and 21h) and then fixed in RNAlater in-orbit. The Ground Control were BRICs prepared identical to spaceflight samples housed in Orbital Environmental Simulator (OES) at the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL-KSC) with a 24-h delay to enable duplication of the environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration) collected by telemetry from the space shuttle (Johnson et al., 2017; Kwon et al., 2015; Paul et al., 2012) (Table 1).

See also Table S1The BRIC-16-DNA experiment (Impact of Spaceflight on Arabidopsis: Deep Sequencing and DNA Arrays as Collaborative Readouts of the Transcriptome of Arabidopsis Seedlings and Undifferentiated Cell in Space) disclosed that A. thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) seedlings grown in space change the expression of 300 genes with respect to ground control samples. Between the differentially genes expressed, genes upregulated are associated with pathogen response, wounding, drought stress and cold stress (generalized stress-response) and genes downregulated are transcription factors involved in cell wall metabolism and cell elongation and genes encoding proteins that function in calcium-mediated signaling (gravitropism). The authors suggest that both the gravity signaling system and the stress signaling related to wounding and pathogens converge in their responses involving the actin-based cytoskeletal network attached to plasma membrane and the cell wall. It is possible that any of these signaling mechanisms are balanced by the force of gravity. Hence, the absence of gravity may confound the signaling system, inducing inappropriate stress responses as a consequence (Paul et al., 2012). The transcriptional analysis of BRIC-16-Regulation experiment (Actin Regulation of Arabidopsis Root Growth and Orientation During Space Flight) showed that spaceflight conditions triggered the downregulation of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and oxidative stress in Col-0 seedlings. Most of these genes are expressed in root hairs (class III peroxidase genes) independently of actin pathways because they were also downregulated in the other Arabidopsis line included in this experiment, the act2-3mutant. These gene expression changes led to shorter root hairs in space-grown seedlings. It is unclear whether this effect was due to microgravity per se or it was a consequence of other spaceflight environmental conditions producing stress, such as hypoxia, which produces the same phenotypic effect. Actually, the BRIC hardware system has several limitations: One is that the seedlings grow confined in small sealed containers for extended periods of time, and other is the absence of orbit 1g control which makes it difficult to distinguish true microgravity effects from other secondary spaceflight effects (Kwon et al., 2015). BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton study (Investigations of the Plant Cytoskeleton in Microgravity with Gene Profiling and Cytochemistry) focused on gene expression changes in shoots of Ler-0 plants. The functional analysis showed that many upregulated transcripts in spaceflight conditions were implicated in metabolic process and transport. Most of these genes were localized in the extracellular matrix and involved in cell wall modification. On the other hand, and unlike the other two BRIC-16 experiments, the downregulated genes were often involved in stress response. This result was associated with the fact that the transcriptional analysis only included shoots. At the same time, an abundance of adventitious roots (immediately transport oxygen from the substrate to shoots) was observed in spaceflight seedlings, suggesting that roots may undergo greater hypoxic stress than shoots during spaceflight. Therefore, pooling all plant organs together for a single analysis could provide an incomplete picture. The BRIC-16 was a cluster of spaceflight experiments performed during the same space mission (STS-131) in the same hardware (Biological Research in Canister, BRIC) with the goal of studying the longer-term plant survival response in the spaceflight environment. Despite these common features, and even though transcripts within the same functional categories (stress response, defense, metabolic processes and cell wall modification) were found to be involved in the response in the different experiments, some differing results were obtained. These differences were associated to the specific experimental conditions of each one of the experiments: BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Regulation used the Col-0 ecotype as wild type whereas BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton used the Ler-0 ecotype; BRIC-16-Regulation and BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton growth media was half-strength MS salts and 1% (w/v) sucrose in agar, but BRIC-16-DNA used only half-strength MS salts in phytagel; BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Regulation used in microarray analysis RNA from entire seedlings whereas BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton used RNA from shoots only (Johnson et al., 2017). The mission SpaceX CRS-4, launched on September 21, 2014, carried a new BRIC experiment with the aim of dissecting plant stress responses and revealing novel pathways for these responses triggered in space. RNA sequencing after growing for 8 days on board the ISS allowed the comparison of the transcriptomes of four A. thaliana ecotypes (Col-0, Ws-2, Ler-0 and Cvi-0) with ground-based control (a duplicated set of BRICs transferred to the ISS Environmental Simulator-ISSES with a 48-h delay to the flight experiment) (Table 1). Cvi-0 seedlings were those with the highest number of genes with deregulated expression, followed by Col-0 and WS-2 plants. In contrast, the Ler-0 plants barely showed changes in the expression of their genes. Common in all ecotypes, transcripts from heat-shock proteins (chaperones) were upregulated, whereas peroxidase transcripts were downregulated in spaceflight (Choi et al., 2019). According to the authors, this shared induction of molecular chaperones may help to protect cellular machinery from oxidative stress potentially triggered by hardware-dependent hypoxic response. In fact, alterations in growth and molecular responses in seedlings grown in BRIC have been described, raising the possibility that this hardware may impose intrinsic stresses on the plants and cause a response in some genes unrelated with the spaceflight environment (Basu et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2017). The spaceflight ecotype-unique transcripts analysis showed that Cvi-0 was enriched in genes involved in light stress, kinase signaling and cell wall modification, Col-0 was enriched in transcripts related to cold and sugar response and, in Ws-2, enrichment in responses related to oxidative stress response was detected. Instead, Ler-0 also showed no significantly over-represented processes because of the small number of genes changing their expression. These results bring out significant differences between ecotype behavior, being Col-0 and Cvi-0 much more responsive to spaceflight conditions, whereas Ler-0 appeared to be relatively resistant to the same conditions, and therefore, highlighting the need to carefully consider the genetic background when comparing data sets and designing spaceflight experiments (Choi et al., 2019). Another experiment that used the BRIC hardware to quantify protein and transcript differential expression of 3-day-old, etiolated Col-0 seedlings grown aboard the ISS, was launched on January 10, 2015 (Space-X CRS-5). The simultaneous proteomic and transcriptomic analyses provided a more complete picture of plant response to spaceflight (Kruse et al., 2020). In addition to the ground control (at ISSES with 48-h delay), in this experiment, two additional analyses were performed to eliminate significant changes in the transcriptome and proteome of Arabidopsis seedlings that could be attributed to the hardware (Basu et al., 2017) or to the RNAlater preservative (Kruse et al., 2017) (Table 1). These studies revealed marked impacts on post- transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics and plastid gene transcription in the plants exposed to microgravity. The effects on microtubule dynamics (alpha tubulins) were explained as a relevant physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, because alpha tubulin has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing the structural integrity of cells in microgravity. A wide variety of plastid-localized and plastid-produced genes appeared differentially regulated in the flight samples, but they were not present in the proteomic data. This result was surprising because BRIC hardware prevents all light from reaching the plants, and it was interpreted as a wasteful effort to enhancing light signaling to compensate for the absence of gravity. In summary, the unified transcriptomic and proteomic analysis points out the regulation of specific elements of cell wall, microtubule synthesis and plastid transcripts production as three new targets to achieve optimal plant growth during future long-term spaceflight missions (Kruse et al., 2020). During SpaceX CRS-12 mission (launched August 14, 2017) transcriptional responses of Col-0 seedlings and seedlings with a compromised unfolded protein response (UPR) to spaceflight were examined with the objective of studying how this response, which is a signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental and cellular stresses, could coordinate gene expression reprogramming in spaceflight stress conditions. For this, the BRIC-PDFU sterile plant culture hardware was used to grow for 14 days Arabidopsis thaliana wildtype and mutants defective in one or more components of the UPR, namely the TFs bZIP28 and bZIP60 (single and double mutants: bzip28, bzip60 and bzip28 bzip60) and the ER-resident kinase/ribonuclease IRE1 (atire1). The transcriptomic results showed that growth in orbit substantially altered expression of thousands of genes associated with biological functions compared with ground control across all genotypes. Specifically, WT had the largest number of differentially expressed genes (1675 DEGs upregulated and 831 DEGs downregulated) and the bzip28 bzip60 mutant had the smallest number of DEGs (1293 upregulated and 562 downregulated). Among these DEGs, 34.8% (783/2249) of upregulated and 27.5% (335//1217) of downregulated overlapped across all genotypes whereas relatively smaller numbers of DEGs were found to be genotype-specific. Therefore, with the aim to gain more insights into the transcriptome changes caused by the absence of a correct UPR signaling under both ground and space flight conditions, the authors performed K-means clustering analysis on FPKM values for all DEGs. This analysis became clear that many of these spaceflight responsive genes were regulated uniquely in certain UPR mutants compared with WT in the ground control and that these variations in ground samples expression were largely muted by spaceflight. Therefore, a genotype-specific regulation in spaceflight condition was not observed. Overall, these results would suggest that the UPR does not have a broad involvement in the response to spaceflight but could play a partial role in regulating the transcriptional reprogramming in space compared with ground control. The reason could be that under space flight conditions many related stress-responsive genes were downregulated, being able to produce alternative signaling pathways, which repress the observed stress responses regulated by UPR (Angelos et al., 2021).The adaptive response to spaceflight environment of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under light conditions The TAGES (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System) flight experiment, constituted by several independent runs launched to the ISS (Run 1: STS-129 November 16, 2009. Run 2: STS-130 February 8, 2010. Run 3: STS-131 April 5, 2010) was conducted within the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System) hardware. This facility allowed to grow Arabidopsis seedlings on standard laboratory Petri plates and provided controlled lighting, temperature and air quality, and minimizing hardware-induced stress factors. In the three biological replicates, seedlings germinated, grew for 12 days and were harvested on orbit to RNAlater-filled KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs). After returning to Earth, they were dissected into roots, leaves and hypocotyls for transcriptomic analysis (microarray). Ground control experiments (one per biological replicate) were conducted using identical ABRS hardware housed in OES chamber programmed to ISS environmental conditions (Paul et al., 2013) (Table 2). The microarray analysis showed that only 480 genes were differentially expressed in spaceflight samples in any organ, but most of these genes were not coordinately expressed among organs (only 26 genes were common in roots, hypocotyls and leaves). Although each organ displayed unique patterns of gene expression in response to spaceflight, the genes were involved in the same functional processes: the down-regulated genes were largely associated with factors regulating cell elongation and hormone signal transduction and the up-regulated genes were closely associated with pathogen responses, wounding and cell wall remodeling. Based on the results obtained, the authors pointed out that spaceflight environments had become extremely well controlled, there hardly being hardware-dependent factors, as indicated by the low number of genes with deregulated expression (48). Therefore, leaves, roots, and hypocotyls engage different genes in response to the spaceflight environment, but utilize similar adaptive strategies, consisting of initiating cellular remodeling and maximizing other environmental cues (for example, light) in a morphological response which is essential to produce a correct growth and development (Paul et al., 2013).

See also Table S1The CARA experiment (Characterizing Arabidopsis Root Attractions, launched on SpaceX CRS-3, April 18th 2014) consisted of growing three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes (wild-types Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia-0 (Col-0) and phytochrome D mutant Col-0 PhyD (phyD)) on Phytagel plates for 11 days secured to a fabric support to the wall in the US lab of the ISS Destiny module. Some of them grew with the ambient light of ISS and some in the dark, wrapped in blackout cloth. After a growth period of 11 days, samples were harvested into KFTs containing RNAlater. A comparable set of plates, grown within the ISSES, monitoring temperature, CO2, relative humidity and light levels, with a delay of 24 h after the initiation of the spaceflight experiment, was the ground control (Paul et al., 2017) (Table 2). The transcriptome responses in the root tips, which was the unique tissue used, showed that differentially expressed genes unique to each genotype were more abundant than those shared with another genotype. Under light exposure, Col-0 showed the greatest number of genes differentially expressed in spaceflight (297), phyD changed the expression of 130 genes and in WS only 71 genes were deregulated. Furthermore, each genotype used almost completely different sets of genes to physiologically adapt to the environment of the ISS. If this differential gene expression is considered as a measure of the physiological adaptive response cost, the WS ecotype would be better adapted to spaceflight than Col-0, and phyD mutation would be considered as a spaceflight-adaptive mutation in Col-0 background, suggesting that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. In the dark, WS and Col-0 seedlings showed roughly the same number of differentially expressed genes (218 and 224, respectively) and phyD exhibited the fewest genes with differential expression (131) indicating that the light environment affects physiological adaptation to spaceflight, which implies that the local habitat can be another factor that can be manipulated to reduce this cost. In this space experiment, all three genotypes were developmentally comparable to the ground control plants and they were equally productive in terms of root length so that only coordinately expressed genes shared amongst the genotypes (18 genes in light and 11 in dark) were considered fundamentally required for physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis to spaceflight. Most of them were up-regulated genes associated with defense mechanisms or cell wall (Paul et al., 2017). The RNA sequencing data collected from root tissue of Col-0 and WS seedlings grown in APEX03-2 (Advanced Plant Experiment 03–2) space experiment was used to investigate the role of alternative splicing during spaceflight adaptation in plants because it was described that terrestrial plant stressors arise unique alternative splicing patterns. In APEX03-2 experiment, launched on SpaceX mission CRS-5 on 10 January 2015, the seedlings grew on Phytagel Petri dishes kept in vertical racks perpendicularly oriented to the light source within the Vegetable Production System (VPS/VEGGIE) on board the ISS. The ground control was carried out inside the VPS ground unit within the ISSES chamber at KSC with a 48-h delay (Beisel et al., 2019; Ferl and Paul, 2016) (Table 2). Opposite to the pattern observed for differentially expressed genes, the analysis of the alternative splicing showed that fewer genes undergo spaceflight-induced significant differential alternative splicing in the Col-0 ecotype background (27) as compared to WS (48), with only 5 overlapping genes between them (Paul et al., 2017). Moreover, gene ontology analysis did not reveal any obvious conclusions respect to the function or localization of the genes with alternative splicing during spaceflight exposure. Although the detection of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms in spaceflight samples, regarding abundance, types, and functional implications, is still pending further investigation, this study presented strong evidence that alternative splicing plays a role in the process of molecular adaptation to the spaceflight environment in plants (Beisel et al., 2019). The Advanced Plant Experiments 03–2 also studied the hypothesis that skewing pathways play a large role in spaceflight adaptation via cell wall remodeling. Differential gene expression profiles of two mutants, differing in their ecotype background, defective in two well-characterized genes which affect different skewing control pathways (spr1 and sku5) and their wild type controls (Col-0 and WS) were examined after growing for 4 and 8 days on ISS. SPIRAL1 plays a role in directional cell expansion by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics and spr1mutation results in axial rotation of cell files throughout the plant, which manifests in roots as skewing to the left. SKU5 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall and plasma membrane protein implicated in stress response signaling and sku5mutant exhibits rightward skewing (Table 2).Morphological data (angle between the root tip and the initial direction of root growth in the 4-day-old seedlings) showed that spr1 seedlings exhibited a consistent leftward skewing phenotype on Earth that was substantially enhanced by spaceflight. Instead, sku5mutant showed a prevention of skewing in spaceflight compared to the ground control. The root length was not altered in either mutant line by spaceflight. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that in spr1 seedlings the number of differential gene expression under spaceflight condition was less than in Col-0 seedlings. In addition, both lines differentially expressed fewer genes at the 8-day timepoint than at 4-day. In contrast, sku5 seedlings the spaceflight differentially expressed genes were five-fold and two-fold more than WS at 4 days and 8 days, respectively. Also, both genotypes increase in their deregulated genes between 4 and 8 days. Among genes that were upregulated in spaceflight for sku5 many were LEA (Late Embryogenesis abundant) family genes, associated with seed dormancy, negative regulation of post-embryonic development and ABA signaling to enhance stress resistance (osmotic, cold, and drought) through membrane stabilization, ROS sequestration and protein aggregation prevention. Moreover, processes involved with salt, ROS stress, and light responses were terms enriched significantly at 4 days and at 8 days and terms associated with cell wall remodeling and biosynthetic processes were overrepresented. The sku5 and spr1 different gene expression patterns, considering the number of differentially expressed genes and their fold-change levels as a measure of metabolic cost of adapting to environment, suggest that mutation of the SPR1 skewing pathway enhances spaceflight physiological adaptation and the SKU5 pathway plays a key role in adaptation to this environment. Furthermore, the fact that spr1 and sku5 root lengths are not altered by spaceflight, indicate that the effects of these mutations lie in processes directing morphology and structure and not in growth processes (Califar et al., 2020). WS seedlings grown in the spaceflight experiment APEX03-2 for 11 days with constant light were used for the determination of differential methylation of leaves and roots (bisulfite DNA sequencing) and differential gene expression (RNA sequencing) in response to spaceflight (Table 2). The authors expected to elucidate the role played by the epigenome in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. It is well documented that terrestrial biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen attack, salt, and drought stress, are elicitors of differential DNA methylation (Zhou et al., 2019). Many genes of the networks involved in the response to these stresses are differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight. The results indicated that although large scale alteration of the average methylation level was not detected in CG, CHG and CHH contexts between flight and ground DNA, thousands of specifically differentially methylated cytosines were discovered with clear organ-specific patterns. In roots, hypomethylated CHH sites predominated whereas leaves showed a predominance of hypermethylated CHH sites. In leaves, about one-fifth of the genes differentially expressed in response to spaceflight (143 out of 743) were also differentially methylated (DmC-DEG), but in roots the fraction was about one-third (75 differentially expressed genes, 21 of which were also differentially methylated). Gene ontology analysis detected stress response to abiotic stimulus, temperature, radiation, and light stimulus categories in roots. In leaves, the detected categories included response to stressors of temperature, radiation and light, plus chemical stress, oxidative stress and a response to oxygen-containing compounds. In addition, in leaves, a 46% of DmC-DEG set were associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results suggested that although DNA methylation may play a significant role in a portion of the genes regulated by spaceflight, it is clearly not the only factor in this regulation. Furthermore, ROS genes may play a unique role in the adaptation of plants to the spaceflight (Zhou et al., 2019). Furthermore, in “The Advanced Plant Experiment-04-Epigenetic Expression” experiment, launched on the SpaceX mission CRS-10 on 19 February 2017, two methylation mutant lines (met1-7 and elp2-5) were grown on the ISS to assess their response to spaceflight compared to that of wild type (Col-0). The plants grew in the Veggie hardware (both on the ISS and in the ISEES chamber) with constant light conditions for 11 days, before being fixed in RNAlater into KFTs. Once on Earth, leaf and root tissues were dissected and, from each sample, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed (Table 2). The two mutant lines are deficient in separate and distinct functions that affect methylation. MET1 (methyl transferase) is directly involved in the maintenance (particularly at CG sites) of cytosine methylation in Arabidopsis and is an enzyme that modifies the epigenome, as part of stress responses. ELP2 (Elongator Protein) interacts with components of the siRNA machinery inducing cytosine methylation by recruitment of the DNA methyl transferase DRM2 and is associated with terrestrial pathogen responses, playing a role in root development (Paul et al., 2021). The results reinforced that, in overall average, genome methylation is not a hallmark of spaceflight adaptation in wild type plants because, for Col-0 plants, the degree of the genome-wide methylation was not statistically significant between spaceflight and ground control samples. Instead, both elp2-5 and mit1-7 plants were generally hypermethylated in spaceflight environment compared to the ground control. Each of the mutant lines demonstrated a different pattern of organ-specific expression and methylation. In met1-7 plants, a large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes in leaves was observed (72 out of 226), whereas in elp2-5, the large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes (101 out of 120) was observed in roots, suggesting that MET1 plays a more important role in leaves and ELP2 in roots, in the process of physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The functional analysis showed that differential methylation took place in elp2-5 line, together with the expression of gene classes that were associated with the spaceflight response in previous experiments, such as, metabolic processes and defense, hormone, and hypoxic responses. Besides, these same spaceflight-associated processes were also among the primary classes enriched in the spaceflight acclimation of Col-0. Conversely, the mutant met1-7 line showed relatively few GO term enrichments, predominantly associated with signal transduction, as membrane transporters or transcriptional activators. These data suggest that met1-7 plants were better adapted to spaceflight than elp2-5plants, and that the response to spaceflight environment acts more directly through mechanisms regulated by ELP2 than through those regulated by MET1 (Paul et al., 2021). Epigenetic changes in Arabidopsis seedlings in response to spaceflight were studied by conducting a whole genome bisulfate sequencing to discover and qualitatively assess spaceflight-associated 5-methyl cytosine epigenetic modifications. In this experiment, 6- day-old Col-0 plants pre-cultured on ground were transferred to culture chambers aboard the Chinese recoverable scientific satellite SJ-10 (launched on April 6 and landed on April 18, 2016) and after grown up to 60 h (2.5 days) under microgravity conditions, seedlings were fixed with RNAlater using a canal system and pump support system included in the equipment. The results demonstrated that lower methylation levels in CHG, CHH, and CpG context tended to occur under microgravity conditions. The molecular function analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) showed that they correspond to genes involved especially in hormone signaling pathways including auxin, ABA, ethylene, and brassinosteroids, genes encoding transcription factors (TF) and genes associated with cell wall metabolism. In addition to methylation alterations at the gene level, transposon elements (TE) showed altered methylation levels during spaceflight. Overall, these results indicate that alterations in the methylation of auxin-related genes and cell wall may play important roles in plants adaptation to microgravity and DNA demethylation within TEs may cause transcriptional alterations in transposons during adaptation to spaceflight conditions (Xu et al., 2018). Contrary to previous experiments that focus on studying the early adaptation response to the space environment, two Chinese missions whose results have been recently published, have focused on studying gene expression changes in the reproductive stage of A. thaliana plants. Because successful completion of the plant seed-to-seed cycle was considered essential to support human life in long-term manned missions, the main objective of these two experiments was to examine how two different photoperiod conditions could affect flowering time under microgravity. (Wang et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). One of the experiments was carried out on board spacelab TG-2 (launched on September 15, 2016) in Plant Culture Box (PCB) hardware that controls the atmosphere, temperature, and hydrates the plants. Sterile seeds of WT (Col-0), pFT:GFP transgenic plants and ft-10 were set on the panel root module containing commercially available vermiculite and stored dry until their hydration. The plants germinated and grew at 21°C under short-day (SD, 8h light/16h dark) or under long-day (LD, 16h light/8h dark) for 48 days, when one of LD PCBs with Arabidopsis plants was taken out by an astronaut and fixed with the RNAlater solution for transcriptomics analysis (Table 2). The initiation of bolting (start of peduncle growth) was delayed under the LD condition on board spaceflight (42 days after sown in spaceflight and 25 days after sown on ground control). According to this result, FT expression occurred later under this light condition because in the ground control the GFP fluorescence reached peak levels at 22 days after sowing and in microgravity the fluorescence peak was reached at 43 days after sowing. The microarray analysis performed using the leaves of WT plants grown under LD revealed that 1793 genes were upregulated whereas there were 1669 downregulated genes in the spaceflight samples with respect to their corresponding ground control. Among the DEGs, 53 flowering genes were identified and classified according to their known or predicted function in the flowering regulation pathway. The data showed that FT expression was upregulated along with a few genes involved in photoperiodism and circadian clock whereas the expression of SOC1 decreased accompanied by the downregulation of key genes involved in the response to the photoperiod, circadian clock, vernalization, ambient temperature, gibberellins and aging. These results indicate for the first time that FT and SOC1 could be key genes for A. thaliana plants to integrate spaceflight condition stress signaling into flowering regulation pathways (Xie et al., 2022). The second experiment was carried out on the Chinese recoverable satellite SJ-10 (launched on April 6, 2016). The plant growth system used consisted of four growth compartments, illumination, photograph, air-flowing, heating, and humidity controlling system. The A. thaliana lines used were WT (Col-0) and transgenic plants (pHSP:FT, pHSP:GFP or FG) expressing FT together Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under control of a heat shock-inducible promoter (HSP17.4), by which it is possible to induce FT expression in-flight by heat shock treatment. The plants loaded in the growth chambers were germinated and grown in the root modules on ground under LD or SD conditions for 20 days, so they had about six to seven rosette leaves when the satellite was launched. After 12 days and 15 h in orbit, SJ-10 returned to Earth and 2 h after landing the plants were harvested and fixed with RNAlater solution (Table 2). As the images taken during the development of the experiment revealed, under the LD condition flowering occurred two days later in the space samples than in the ground controls for both the WT plants and the FG plants. In contrast, under the SD condition after heat shock treatment (37°C for 1h), in WT plants this delay was reduced to 1 day and in FG plants it disappeared, flowering both on ground and in space at 3 days. Microarray analysis was performed using the total RNA from leaves of WT and FG plants grown under LD and the SD in space and on ground, respectively. In the study of the categories of gene expression affected by spaceflight under different photoperiods, 4512 genes in WT and 4201 genes in FG response specifically to the LD or the SD (named \"daylength-related-sp\" or \"dl-sp\"). This higher number of “dl-sp” genes indicates that daylength is an important factor to regulate the response of plants to spaceflight. To further study response of plants to spaceflight after FT expression in the FG plants under the SD in comparison with WT plants, the authors compared the number of DEGs in response to spaceflight under the LD and the SD, respectively, among WT and FG samples. In these comparisons, they identified that 534 DEGS represented the group of genes in FG under the SD condition insensitive to spaceflight stress (unchanged in FG under the LD in space) and they were involved in cellular metabolic processes, as amino acid, amine, and oxoacid metabolic process. Conversely, the most sensitive genes to spaceflight in FG plants under the SD condition (was significantly altered only in this condition) were 467 DEGs, many of them related with abiotic stimulus response and post-translational protein modification. Finally, 251 DEGs with function in chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway and response to stimulus non-changed their expression in WT under SD. These transcriptomic results together with bolting times indicated that heat shock-induced FT expression in FG plants could be used as a gen switch for flowering induction in space, which could change the sensitivity to the abiotic stimulus and/or cellular metabolic processes and therefore, alter plant response to spaceflight (Wang et al., 2022).Gene expression changes in well-controlled environmental conditions including several light profiles and partial gravity levels (EMCS experiments) The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) was another hardware facility aboard ISS which was used to grow plants on space. It provided directional light with white LEDs, controlled environment conditions (temperature, humidity, CO2, O2 and ethylene concentration) and it was equipped with two centrifuges that allowed to incubate the samples at different levels of gravity, up to 2g. This allowed them to perform an on-board 1g control, and also to incubate the samples at the so-called “partial gravity levels”, lower than 1g, such as those characterizing the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. In the TROPI-2 experiment (launched on space shuttle mission STS-130 in February 2010) WT seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype were grown for 6 days within the EMCS, and they were photostimulated with blue or red light at seven gravitational acceleration levels (μg, 0.07g, 0.13g, 0.21g, 0.39g, 0.53g and 1g) for the last 48h of the growth period. For seedling growth, photostimulation and video recording, samples were contained in special cassettes equipped with a hydration mechanism remotely operated, blue, red and white LEDs, which were used instead of the EMCS lighting system, and an “anti-fog” device that prevented water condensation from the cassette window. After the photostimulation phase, a crew member transferred samples from the EMCS to the to the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS) facility for preservation until download. The ground control was performed in a laboratory incubator following the exact timeline and light treatments as the spaceflight experiment (Kiss et al., 2012). TROPI-2 experiment was a duplication of the original TROPI experiment after the problems experienced with the samples because of the presence of toxic volatile substances in the hardware (Table 3).

See also Table S1.The primary objectives of the TROPI-2 experiment were to study plant tropisms in spaceflight (interaction between gravitropic and phototropic signals) using images, but samples from this experiment were also used to perform transcriptome analyses with RNA was extracted from whole seedlings, with the purpose of maximizing the scientific returns of the spaceflight experiment. The comparison between all spaceflight samples, regardless of their gravity or light treatment, with the 1g ground samples, identified 280 genes that were differentially regulated. However, in the comparison of all g-treated spaceflight samples with microgravity samples, only 130 genes were identified as being differently regulated. From these genes, several of them were involved in cell polarity, cell defense or stress, and cell wall development. This result suggested that all of the spaceflight samples had a more similar environment because overall fewer number of genes were differentially expressed in the second comparison than in the first one, supporting the role that gravity plays in affecting these key developmental pathways, which were both represented in the two comparisons. In addition, as this hardware allowed performing a 1g-spaceflight control, these samples were compared with the 1g ground control. This resulted in a large number of genes differentially regulated (230), many of them implicated in cell-wall development, cell polarity and oxygen responses, among other categories. The fact that the 1g spaceflight versus 1g ground samples revealed many genes with deregulated expression could be because of spaceflight effects other than microgravity (vibration, radiation exposure, etc), emphasizing the need for tissue fixation on board the ISS and better environmental monitoring tools to improve ground experiments (Correll et al., 2013). The Seedling Growth project (SG) was another plant space experiment performed in EMCS hardware, which consisted of three phases, each performed in different spaceflights: SG1 (uploaded via SpaceX CRS-2 in March 2013), SG2 (uploaded via SpaceX CRS-4 in September 2014) and SG3 (uploaded via SpaceX CRS-11 in June 2017). The goal of this project was to unraveling the link between the two main environmental cues driving plant development (light and gravity) at reduced gravity levels. Specifically, the project aimed at exploring if, and to what extent, specific light conditions could be applied to overcome, or at least to mitigate the deleterious effects caused by the lack of gravity on plant growth and development, thus facilitating the adaptation of plants to the space environment (Table 3). Ler seedlings grew under 6 nominal gravity levels (μg, 0.09g or low gravity, 0.18g or Moon gravity, 0.36g or Mars gravity, 0.57g or reduced Earth gravity, and 1.0g) illuminated under white light for 96h (4 days) followed by 48h (2 days) of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light. The transcriptome analysis (RNAseq) of these samples revealed differential gene families affected and a clear difference in the intensity of the transcriptional response. At microgravity level photosynthesis, photosynthetic antenna proteins, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum were downregulated pathways. Nevertheless, only two pathways, ribosome synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation were found to be upregulated. These results suggested that a possible interplay between plant growth in microgravity and plastid function could exist (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). The analysis focused on partial gravity levels showed that as the gravity load increased the number of differentially expressed genes with respect to 1g control decreased, with a remarkable exception of the low gravity level (lower than 0.1g), which is the one that resulted in the highest number of deregulated genes. The DEG number was 296 in microgravity, 568 in low gravity, 123 in Moon gravity, 19 in Mars gravity and only 2 genes in reduced Earth gravity. In addition, the functional Gene Ontology (GO) analysis only identified enriched categories in μg, low-g and Moon g-level, which were clearly different with the increasing partial-g level. In microgravity, light and photosynthesis GO terms were enriched, whereas response to stress, response to chemicals, and response to hormones were enriched in low gravity and the more representative enrichment in Moon gravity was related to cell wall and membrane structure. The general stress response detected in low gravity level was explained as the consequence of competition between phototropism (blue light) and the weak gravitropism signal (0.09g) to be the fundamental cue for driving seedling growth and plant development, resulting in a stress for the plant. Instead, the existence of the gravitropic response along with blue light illumination seemed to be enough to restore a nearly normal transcriptional state, particularly at Mars gravity level (Herranz et al., 2019). The SG project also studied by transcriptomic changes the adaptive response of A. thaliana Col-0 seedlings grown at two nominal gravity levels (μg and Mars gravity level, or 0.3g). These samples were illuminated for 4 days in a long-day photoperiod (16h white light and 8h dark) and in the last 2 days of growth period half of them were photostimulated with red light and the other half were kept in darkness (Table 3). The results indicated that only in microgravity condition, both in darkness and under red light, elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression was observed, being probably associated with a disturbed retrograde and anterograde communication between these organelles and the nucleus. Furthermore, in this condition, genes involved in hormonal pathways that promote proliferation, such as auxin and cytokinin signal transduction, were activated. On the other hand, at Mars g-level genes of hormone pathways related with stress response (abscisic acid, ethylene and salicylic acid) were activated. Furthermore, upregulation of environmental acclimation-related transcriptions factors (WRKY and NACs families) was also observed, especially in samples grown at Mars gravity level and photostimulated with red light, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial gravity level are able to acclimate by modulating genome expression in routes activated to cope with space environment-associated stress (Villacampa et al., 2021). Under these same growing conditions, two knockout lines of nucleolin protein, nuc1-2 and nuc2-2, affecting the two variants of this gene in A. thaliana, were grown in the SG series spaceflight experiments. The use of the nucleolin mutants can significantly contribute to the knowledge of the plant response to spaceflight environment, because NUC1 protein occupies a central position in ribosome biogenesis regulation, a complex stress-sensitive process which has been found to be seriously altered under conditions of spaceflight. In addition, NUC1 gene expression is known to be upregulated by red light on Earth. In turn, NUC2 protein participates in the mechanisms of adaptive responses to different stresses. First, transcriptome analysis was performed only with ground control samples with the purpose of knowing the response of nucleolin mutants to different illumination conditions, namely red light and darkness (Table 3). Under red light photostimulation, ribosome biogenesis was the most significantly enriched category within the upregulated genes in nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2. On seedlings kept in darkness during the last 2 days of cultivation, gene categories mainly involved in processes of cell division appeared promoted, and gene categories mainly related to developmental processes were downregulated in nuc1-2 seedlings versus WT and nuc2-2 seedlings. All these results indicate that on Earth the partial capability of the NUC2 gene of replacing the functions of NUC1 gene in darkness, when this gene is not present, is enhanced by red light. Furthermore, this photoactivation induces in the nuc2-2mutant an increased expression of genes belonging to functional groups associated to stress response, which means that NUC2 protein has a greater capacity of response to environmental signals, such as illumination with red light, and therefore, nuc2-2 plants cannot develop a full response to this stimulus. The results of this work bring out, in space-omics spaceflight experiments, the need to pay special attention to the ground reference controls because identifying the genetic background in the this condition is essential before conclusions can be made on the spaceflight results (Manzano et al., 2020). The “Plant Signaling” experiment, also carried out in the EMCS (launched in July 2011 aboard STS-135), studied the transcriptional profiling of root samples exposed for 5 days under continuous light at microgravity or partial g (0.53g, 0.65g and 0.88g) (Table 3). The analysis identified 101 genes whose expression levels were associated with gravity dose following three different patterns: increase or decrease expression in response to increasing g levels (dose-dependent linear response), peak or dip at an intermediate g level (peak up or peak down response) and induced or repressed expression levels to a threshold g level (threshold response). In addition, the identification of the biological functions or pathways of these 101 fractional-g responsive genes showed that they were genes involved in transcription regulation, chaperone function, cell wall and defense response. All of these categories had been previously described as being responsive to the plant response to the space environment (Sheppard et al., 2021).Adaptive response to spaceflight environment of other plant species The molecular response to the long-term spaceflight environment of Mizuna plants was measured using genome-wide mRNA expression analysis (mRNAseq). Seeds of Brassica rapa var. nipposinica (Mizuna) were germinated and grown in Lada growth chambers aboard to Zvezda module of ISS. These chambers include a root module, leaf chamber and light module. After 27 days cultivation, the plants were harvested and stored at −80°C in the MELFI freezer. Once back on Earth, total RNA from leaves samples was extracted. The fresh weight and water content (spaceflight: 82.9g and 92.5%, ground control: 58.0g and 92.0%) showed that Mizuna plants grew as well or better under spaceflight environment than on the ground. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that in space-grown plants a total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative markers were upregulated more than two-fold, including the major ROS-scavenging enzymes: thioredoxin and glutaredoxin. In addition, two ROS-producing genes (NADPH oxidase genes: RbohD and RbohF) were upregulated 3-fold and 5.1-fold, respectively. These findings suggest that the Mizuna plants can acclimate to long-term exposure in the spaceflight environment by reprogramming ROS gene network expression, producing ROS to maintain the activation of ROS signal network to control the defense system with ROS-scavenging system (Sugimoto et al., 2014). Arabidopsis thaliana cell culture adaptive response to spaceflight environment (Table S2) Arabidopsis thaliana wild type semisolid callus cultures were exposed to spaceflight conditions for 5 days within the Simbox hardware on board the Chinese spacecraft Shenzhou 8 (launched on October 31, 2011). The Simbox incubator enabled sample cultivation at controlled temperatures (22–24°C) and humidity (30–40%) and provided 1g in-flight control by means of an integrated centrifuge. In addition, this hardware included a pump system for metabolic quenching of the samples by RNAlater injection. The ground control experiment started with a one-day delay into the Simbox duplicate, according to the position in the flight incubator and kept at 23°C (Fengler et al., 2015) (Table 4). The microarray analysis detected 298 genes with differential expression between sample groups flight space (FS) and in-flight centrifugation (FC) but the differences in expression were not statistically significant. This result could mean that 5 days are enough for the culture adaptation to the new situation (spaceflight). Thus, in order to identify processes which are specifically influenced by microgravity and could provide important information about the physiological needs after a few days in space, overrepresented processes that were identical in the comparisons between FS samples and two 1g controls (in-flight centrifugation or FG and ground static or GS) were analyzed. Among the genes with upregulated expression, some of them constitute the ribosomal complex within plastids, and some others were genes involved in electron transport chains located within mitochondria and representative for ATP biosynthesis. Among the downregulated genes the largest group was shown to code for HSPs. These results indicated that 5 days of exposure to microgravity did not cause detectable significant changes in gene expression, but caused an increased energy demand which should be taken into consideration when plants will be used as part of bioregenerative supports on long duration space missions. Finally, with the aim to separate responses to microgravity from those of non-microgravity-related spaceflight conditions, genes that were significantly altered within spaceflight samples (FS and FC) compared to the 1g ground control were studied. The majority of these genes were involved in the stress-induced antioxidant system, signaling chains, and defense-resistance response. The alteration of these processes was assumed as the effect of spaceflight-related environmental conditions, and especially, with the high radiation dose received by space samples (0.51 mSV/d), much more intense than terrestrial levels of radiation (1 to 2 mSV/a) (Fengler et al., 2015).

See also Table S2.The aforementioned BRIC-16-DNA experiment also included the transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana tissue culture cells (Paul et al., 2012)(Table 4). One of the most striking molecular differences observed was the significant increase in expression of most heat shock proteins (HSP) and heat shock factor (HSF) transcriptional activators genes in spaceflight non-differentiated tissue culture cells. Among these genes, the HsfA2 transcription factor which is involved in the late phases of heat stress response, and two of its targets: Hsp17.6A, that blocks protein aggregation, and Hsp101, that facilitates dissociation of already formed protein aggregates. In addition, the expression changes in these two HSP proteins, as markers of late stress response, were studied in parabolic flights (hypergravity and hypogravity alternation), in simulated microgravity (2D clinorotation) and in simulated hypergravity (centrifuge) by RT-qPCR. Among gravitational conditions examined, only 2D clinorotation induced the expression of both Hsp101 and HSP17.6A at the same levels as spaceflight. This fact suggests that hypergravity forces experienced at the space shuttle launch do not contribute to the elevated level of HSP transcripts in spaceflight samples. Therefore, a unique feature of microgravity engages HSPs as part of a later-phase adaptive response to spaceflight conditions, probably associated with the role played by them in cytoskeletal organization, preventing cytoskeletal scaffold collapse in a non-gravity environment (Zupanska et al., 2013). The Cellular Expression Logic, or CEL BRIC-17 experiment, was a modification of the previous Arabidopsis cell cultures experiment in BRIC-16. In this experiment, launched on SpaceX CRS-2 to the ISS on 1 March 2013, besides the WT cell line, two mutant lines were used: ARG1 KO and HSFA2 KO (Zupanska et al., 2017, 2019). The knockout line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 was selected for the role of this protein in gravisignaling, whereas the knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 was selected because this protein is a key regulator of the defense response, via HSP chaperone transcriptional activation, to several types of environmental stresses (Table 4). The transcriptome analysis, after 10 days on orbit, showed that both mutant cell lines used substantially more and different gene expression profiles to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state compared to WT cells. This observation led to conclude that a proficient spaceflight adaptation requires a functional HSF network and functional ARG1 protein. The functional gene categorization revealed that, although individual genes were different in each expression set, those genes were largely representative of the same biological processes, suggesting slightly different routes, which appeared to be utilized to converge on the same basic adaptive strategies. In addition, most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1- and HsfA2-dependent. Specifically, these genes were involved in cell wall remodeling, intracellular transport and starch biosynthesis, suggesting major and specific roles of these two proteins in the physiological spaceflight adaptation through these processes. Overall, this study showed up that the use of knockout lines greatly increases the list of genes that are necessary to adapt to and survive in the spaceflight environment. This amplifies the information that is necessary to learn on what biological processes are necessary and what genes are involved in these processes (Zupanska et al., 2017, 2019). Arabidopsis thaliana cell culture adaptive response to simulated space environments (Table S3) Cell cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana were exposed to partial-g forces (0.16g, 0.38g and 0.5g) for different times during parabolic flight (24 s, 33 s and 20 s) and clinostat experiments (5 min, 10 min and 30 min), in order to investigate gravity-dependent alterations in gene expression by whole-genome microarray analysis (Fengler et al., 2016) (Table 5). The results revealed that, in simulation by clinorotation, the least effects (the lowest number of differentially expressed genes at least 2-fold) were obtained after 30 min at 0.5g. Furthermore, the hierarchical clustering (Pearson`s Correlation Coefficient) suggested that, in the clinorotation experiment, gene expression was more affected by the exposure time than by the change in gravity, because 0.16g, 0.38g and 0.5g generated no separate cluster for a given time of exposure and, interestingly, under 30 min of exposure, all gravity levels clustered with 1g controls. Although the clustering illustrated a low similarity between real (parabolic flight) and simulated partial-g, the screening at the single gene level identified many common differentially expressed genes, mainly at 0.38g. Among them, genes coding for proteins involved in cell wall modifications, peroxidases, auxin-related proteins, transmembrane proteins and components of intracellular signaling chains like different protein kinases, transcription factors and phytohormone-related proteins were identified. Taken together this study suggests that, after 30 min of clinorotation, specific responses are fading, demonstrating the insusceptibility of cell cultures over time and that clinorotation can induce changes in levels of transcripts similar to flight experiments (Fengler et al., 2016).

See also Table S3.In another work, callus semi-solid cultures of A. thaliana, prepared from MM2d suspension cultures, were exposed for 200 min to two paradigms of simulated microgravity (a mechanical one, the Random Positioning Machine (RPM) and diamagnetic levitation) and hypergravity (the Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC)). Five environments with different levels of effective gravity (g) and magnetic field (B) strengths within a magnet (μg ∗B = 10.1 T, 0,1g∗ B = 14.7 T, 1g∗ B = 16.5 T, 1.9g∗ B = 14.7 T and 2g∗ B = 10.1 T) and samples exposed to RPM simulated microgravity (μg) and hypergravity (2g) in the Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC) were compared (Manzano et al., 2012) (Table 5). The effects on the overall transcriptional state of callus exposed to these altered gravitational environments were studied. Microarray analysis indicated that barely a few genes were differentially expressed (not reaching statistical significance) when exposed to these unusual environments compared with internal 1g controls (particularly because of the large effect of high-energy magnetic field). However, using a detailed analysis based on clustering of similarly expressed genes (Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector-GEDI) it was found that gravitational and magnetic fields had a synergistic effect on the transcriptional profile because both the number of altered genes and the GO groups affected increased when a magnetic field gradient was applied, mainly affecting structural, abiotic stress and secondary metabolism genes. In fact, it is the first study in which a 0.1g partial gravity samples show larger effects that those observed in the equivalent simulated microgravity sample under the same environmental condition. The GEDI analysis also revealed that, there is a global signature, specifically including abiotic stress genes, that behave in an opposite manner under micro and hypergravity environments (Manzano et al., 2012). Plant cell proliferation is a process known to be affected during spaceflight, but the molecular mechanisms involved in these changes remain unclear. To investigate transcriptomic changes in cell cycle regulation and progression by simulated microgravity, an Arabidopsis immobilized suspension culture was incubated in the RPM. Particularly, the analysis was performed with two synchronous subpopulations, enriched in G2/M and G1 phases, incubated for respectively 7 h and 14 h within the RPM, and an asynchronous reference cell culture incubated for 14h (Kamal et al., 2019) (Table 5). The results showed that the number of differentially expressed genes common in all populations by the simulated microgravity environment was low: 73 genes were upregulated, mostly being NADH/oxidative activity-related genes and mitochondria-related functions, and 83 genes were downregulated, most of them involved in ribosome activity and in photosynthesis-related functions. Conversely, simulated microgravity had differential effects on gene expression through the cell cycle progression. The expression of genes related to cell cycle regulation function, cell organization, ribosome biogenesis and developmental processes were downregulated in the G2/M population and upregulated in the G1 population, whereas abiotic stress response genes were upregulated in the G2/M population and downregulated significantly in the G1 population. Among the genes involved in abiotic stress response, genes that respond to UV-B, heat, osmotic shock and wounding are upregulated in synchronous G2/M population, but they were repressed in the synchronous G1 culture after 14 h of incubation in the RPM. These differential patterns of gene expression of stress pathways suggest differential sensitivity to microgravity of different phases of the cell cycle. It was proposed that a rapid initial response to a new environment within the first 7 h occurs mainly through the activation of expression of stress-related genes, whereas, at 14h of incubation, the gene expression patterns change as a result of a longer-term adaptive strategy that inhibits those pathways (Kamal et al., 2019).Adaptive response to spaceflight environment of cell cultures from other species Ceratopteris richardii spores were exposed to microgravity aboard NASA shuttle flight STS-93 to identify the early cellular and molecular events associated with gravity signal perception and response. These fern single-cells have been particularly valuable for investigating how cells sense and respond to gravity because this signal orients the polarity of their development shortly after light initiates their germination. The spores remained dormant in darkness inside BRIC canisters until the gravity force was less than 0.001g, and then were exposed to ambient light in the mid-deck to induce germination. After light exposure at three developmental time points (1 h, 8 h and 20 h) spores were frozen in a gaseous nitrogen freezer and were kept frozen until total RNA was isolated (Table 4). Microarray analysis showed that genes likely to encode peroxidases are downregulated in spaceflight development whereas protein phosphatase 2C and chaperone expression were upregulated in spores during the first 20 h of their germination in microgravity. Moreover, genes that may be involved in mobilization of reserve lipids were upregulated in spaceflight and genes whose products are likely involved in lipid hydrolysis/synthesis/transfer showed reduced mRNA levels during development in microgravity. These results, taken together, suggest that in microgravity lipids utilization and stress response changes occur in ferns and may be common features of spaceflight response in plant cells. Moreover, these findings provided new insights into early physiological responses to microgravity and are valuable data unraveling the basis genetic mechanisms that drive single-cell gravity responses (Salmi and Roux, 2008). The spaceship Shenzhou mission also included one experiment to study gene expression in rice calli in response to microgravity. Rice calli (Oryza sativa) were loaded onto the stationary and rotating platforms of Simbox incubator and were fixed in RNAlater in space after 324h (13,5 days) spacecraft flight (Table 4). The functional analysis identified that the microgravity-response transcripts were associated with metabolism and signaling pathways of hormones, transcription factors, starch, glycolysis and the electron chain, protein degradation, transporters and cell wall metabolism. Among cell wall-related genes, genes related to cell wall formation/degradation were downregulated and transcripts corresponded to proteins involved in primary cell wall modification were upregulated. In addition, genes of the aquaporin family (water channels) were upregulated in spaceflight environment. The changed levels of these cell wall loosening and cell wall precursor synthesis-related genes together with aquaporin genes may establish of a new balance between cell wall rigidity and cell turgor pressure under microgravity conditions. Therefore, cell wall relaxation and extension may be regarded as microgravity plants adaptation (Jin et al., 2018).Discussion and conclusions In the last decade, the landscape of plant biology research in spaceflight and simulated microgravity research has greatly advanced, mostly with the incorporation of space transcriptomics tools such as RNAseq and microarrays. The aim of this review was therefore to revise the knowledge acquired through these techniques. The focus and organization of the work around the hardware used in the various experiments facilitated the comparison of the numerous results obtained and made it possible the identification of gene expression networks leading to a better knowledge of the plant adaptation mechanisms to spaceflight conditions. The report also highlighted the European contribution in the acquisition of this knowledge. Even considering that novel experimental approaches take more time to be incorporated to space research than to general life science research on ground because of obvious and specific constraints of spaceflight experiments, these technologies have provided more than 25 datasets deposited in GeneLab database (Tables S1, S2 y S3). In that regard, Figure 1 illustrates the type of studies performed at the international level, arranged according to the materials and facilities used. The European contribution to the global plant biology experimentation is modest in the global numbers (8 of 30 studies) but particular contributions have been made in key topics. An example is the European co-leadership of the largest plant experiment carried out on board the ISS, using the most sophisticated hardware, that is the EMCS, including lighting at different wavelengths, partial-g and 1g, and environmental controls (Herranz et al., 2019; Vandenbrink et al., 2019; Villacampa et al., 2021). Also, there is a key contribution of European teams in simulated microgravity facilities and the use of cell cultures to uncover fundamental mechanisms discriminating the professional response to the lack of gravity from the purely cellular response and adaptive mechanisms. It is particularly relevant to realize that a small number of cell-based studies in simulators may have contributed to our understanding of these mechanisms more significantly than some spaceflight missions. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Distribution of Plant Space Omics contributions submitted to the GeneLab database Most European contributions (in bold) have been done using cell culture experiments in simulated microgravity facilities (10% of the experiments) and the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) into the ISS (17% of the experiments). Other facilities frequently used in spaceflight experiments are the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware and the VPS-VEGGIE cultivation chamber. At the top and the bottom part of the figure, images of some of the different facilities used are shown. From left to right and from top to bottom: Random Positioning Machine (credit ESA), Magnetic Levitation Instrument (credit Nottingham University) BRIC (credit NASA), Large Diameter Centrifuge (credit ESA), EMCS (credit ESA/NASA) and VEGGIE (credit NASA).There is a clear dominance by number of studies in the use of BRIC hardware by NASA researchers (20% of the studies). This experimental hardware facilitates a large number of experiments to be quickly performed in orbit, but it shows serious limitations as to the environmental conditions that can be controlled and monitored. Indeed, the absence of a 1g control in space does not allow to discriminate between alterations caused by microgravity and other environmental factors such as hypoxia or a reduced confined space, which does not allow the cultivation of plants in good conditions over a period of time longer than a few days. For example, in the BRIC-16 experiments, the cytoskeleton was clearly shown to have a key role in the response of plants to spaceflight stresses, but it was not clear whether this response was a consequence of adaptation to the absence of gravity, or to another environmental factor independent of microgravity, such as hypoxia (Kwon et al., 2015). Other facilities with better control of the environmental conditions (ABRS and VPS/VEGGIE), particularly those including a 1g control on board (EMCS and Simbox harware), lead to more sophisticated results. In fact, the presence of a centrifuge on board not only makes it possible to obtain 1g control in space, and thus to discriminate the responses of plants because of the absence of gravity from other environmental factors, but it also makes it possible to obtain partial gravity levels such as that of the Moon (0.18g) and that of Mars (0.36g), which is essential for preparing future missions to the Moon and Mars. Improvements in cultivation constraints, optimization of controls and the systematic use of the model plant A. thaliana have allowed a great advance in the acquisition and comparison of results. It should be noted, however, that restoring terrestrial gravity or partial gravity such as that of Mars or the Moon on a centrifuge may induce experimental biases that have not yet been evaluated at the cellular scale. For example, the rotation may introduce vibrations to which the cells may respond independently of the level of gravity and the centrifugal forces are not applied homogeneously on a culture surface, but rather they are applied according to a gradient that is defined from the axis of rotation, which may be a source of some heterogeneity in the study population. Despite the limitations in interpreting the results because of different experimental constraints, our knowledge of the adaptive response to spaceflight environment of A. thaliana seedlings has unequivocally advanced. Transcriptomic analysis techniques (RNAseq and microarray) as well as the consensual use of the model species A. thaliana allowed us to highlight common response pathways in the majority of the experiments carried out on board the ISS. Thus, the main processes affected identified in these studies were cell wall remodeling, oxidative stress, defense reaction, HSPs, and photosynthesis. Consequently, we are in conditions of identifying some mechanisms of adaptation of plants to microgravity, based on similar gene expression profiles obtained in different experiments (Figure 2). The absence of gravity is perceived by the plant as a stress factor, which will trigger a whole series of adaptation reactions of the plant to this new environmental factor. Some of these reactions seem to be specifically targeted in the maintenance of cell integrity, such as cell wall remodeling, whereas others affect plant metabolism, such as photosynthesis, the electron transfer chain in mitochondria, and the communication between nuclei, plastids, and mitochondria. Finally, other reactions are systematically triggered by many biotic and abiotic stresses, such as oxidative stress, defense reactions and HSPs (chaperone proteins). Although the link between all responses has yet to be determined, it is clear that all of them play an essential role in the adaptation of plants to the space environment, becoming key targets for optimal growth plants to support future long-term spaceflight missions. (Figure 3). Figure 2. Open in a new tab The main spaceflight-related genes Transcriptomic analyses of the numerous space experiments have so far identified a set of genes whose expression is altered by the spaceflight environment in a similar way among the different experiments. The genes were grouped according to the function of their proteins. (N) nucleus, (P) plastid, (M) mitochondria, (PR protein) pathogenesis related protein, (ROS) reactive oxygen species, (HSF) heat shock factor, (HSP) heat shock protein.Figure 3. Open in a new tab Proposed model of the microgravity adaptation mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana Microgravity is perceived by the plant as an abiotic stress factor which activates the production of ROS. The signal, which is perceived at the plasma membrane, is then transmitted via Ca2+, MAPKs and phytohormones (auxin) to the nucleus where it triggers TFs like HSF. The TFs then regulate the expression of a set of genes that trigger molecular, cellular and physiological responses, leading to the establishment of the plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment. (ROS) reactive oxygen species, (TFs) transcription factors, (HSF) heat shock factor, (HSP) heat shock protein.Other molecular processes involved in the response to different environmental stress factors on Earth, such as DNA methylation and alternative splicing, seem to be also involved in this adaptation response, as the first transcriptomics studies of these two processes have revealed (Beisel et al., 2019; Paul et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019). However, different responses or even contradictory results depending on the environmental conditions have also been found between the different experiments (Johnson et al., 2017), strongly suggesting that the adaptive mechanisms, as a whole, should be more complex than these observed responses alone. In fact, the large number of different ecotypes and mutants used in the different experiments have shown that the response between the Arabidopsis ecotypes used is very different, some of them showing a greater capacity to adapt to the space environment or with less cost by changing the expression of a low number of genes, as it happens to Ler. (Choi et al., 2019; Paul et al., 2017). The mutant lines in different genes involved in various processes such as skewing, DNA methylation and UPR (Angelos et al., 2021; Califar et al., 2020; Paul et al., 2021) have provided more detailed information about the role that these processes play in the adaptation of plants to a space flight environment. In addition, differences between the genes whose expression is altered have been found between the different organs of the plant (Paul et al., 2013). Both findings indicate that the genetic background is an aspect to take into account to choice of the most suitable crop plant models and that knowing the integrated response of all parts of the plant will be crucial for the next phase of spaceflight experimentation. Light, as the results of the different experiments demonstrate, is an essential factor in all plant development stages under spaceflight environment. The light quality, and specifically red light in the early stages of development (seedlings), modulates the expression of genes involved in related-stress pathways to cope with environmental spaceflight conditions (Villacampa et al., 2021). In addition, the day length is a factor that can regulate the plants flowering time, and it is even possible to use a genetic switch to induce flowering by adding a treatment, such as a heat shock (Wang et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). Furthermore, it has been shown that the adaptive response of plants depends on both the level of gravity (Herranz et al., 2019; Sheppard et al., 2021)) and the time of exposure to the spatial environment (Fengler et al., 2015; Kamal et al., 2019)). In fact, an early and a late response can be identified in the adaptive response of plant cell cultures grown in simulated microgravity (Kamal et al., 2019). ROS production was also demonstrated in other members of the Brassicaceae family, such as Mizuma (Brassica rapa) and parietal changes were observed in rice (Oryza sativa), confirming the key role of these two cellular processes in the adaptation processes of plants to microgravity. Finally, we consider it necessary to recapitulate why this research is actually important and worth to be performed. As previously indicated, studying the adaptation of plants to the space environment is an essential step towards successfully integrating plants into life support systems. During spaceflight, plants will have to adapt to a new environment where factors such as micro- and mini-gravity (gravities of spaceflight, the Moon and Mars) and chronic low-level cosmic radiation are completely new to them. In that regard, experiments introducing partial gravity levels, and particularly the levels around the Moon gravity, are becoming mandatory. A potential risk in using low gravity levels (circa 0.1g) with more deleterious effects than microgravity itself have been revealed (Herranz et al., 2019; Manzano et al., 2018), and the decommissioning of EMCS in 2018 from the ISS made us less able to provide new experiments at those conditions. In this field, transcriptomic studies are a privileged strategy because they allow an analysis of gene expression in its entirety, leading to the identification of response pathways that would not be detected by more targeted approaches (Lowe et al., 2017). They also have the advantage of requiring only a relatively small quantity of transcripts (1 ng of total RNA for RNAseq and 1 μg of mRNA for microarray), which is a major advantage in the context of space experiments where the quantity of biological material is always very limited. In contrast, there are two potential caveats to the advance of the research field. The first is the uneven distribution of spaceflight opportunities in space agencies, particularly the unavailability of ESA to provide a replacement with similar capabilities to EMCS. The second is the analysis and integration of results from so different experiment platforms, materials and designs. New international consortia have been created to cope with better tools for transcriptomic analyses, improvement to the access of datasets and metadata, contributing decisively to the optimization of the new experiments to be conducted in the near future. GeneLab (Overbey et al., 2021), TOAST (Barker et al., 2020), ESA Space Omics TT (Madrigal et al., 2020) and ISSOP (Rutter et al., 2020) are highly relevant initiatives in this direction. Limitations of the study The transcriptomic studies included in this review focus on the search carried out mainly in GeneLab Data Repository and despite the fact that the GLDS data set includes an interface to search datasets on key repositories ( GEO, EBI PRIDE, and ANLMG-RAST), some work focused on transcriptomic changes produced by a space environment might not have been included.Methods details To locate the works that study the plants adaptive response to a real or simulated space environment through transcriptomic analysis, NASA GeneLab data repository has been used as a reference (https://genelab.nasa.gov/). To perform an exhaustive search, the word ‘plants’ was used as a filter in the search data box and the total results were checked one by one to confirm that the publication includes and meets the criteria. In addition, to search for works not included in this database a manual search was carried out, in the Web of Science, Google Scholar and - using as key search terms ‘plants spaceflight’/ ‘plants simulated microgravity’ together with ‘RNA sequencing ‘, ‘microarray’, ‘transcriptomic’, ‘epigenomics’, and ‘alternative splicing’.Acknowledgments All listed authors are members of the ESA Space Omics Topical Team, funded by the ESA grant/contract 4000131202/20/NL/PG/pt “Space Omics: Towards an integrated ESA/NASA–omics database for spaceflight and ground facilities experiments” awarded to RH.

    "abstract": "Abstract Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity. Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1g. A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities.

    "introduction": "Introduction Plant tropisms are growth-mediated movements relative to the direction of an external stimulus. In early studies, these movements were first characterized by Darwin and Darwin (1880), however, description of plant movement actually dates back to the Ancient Romans (Ovid 8 AD 2008). Plants exhibit these growth-mediated responses to external cues, including water (hydrotropism, Kiss 2007), touch or contact (thigmotropism, Braam 2005), the sun or light (heliotropism and phototropism, respectively Briggs 1964; Vandenbrink et al. 2014a, b; Kutschera and Briggs 2016), and gravity (gravitropism, Chen et al. 1999; Kiss 2000) among others. Tropisms are important for plants, which as sessile organisms, utilize these movements to respond to external stimuli (Kaufman et al. 1987; Whippo and Hangarter 2004). Typically, in ground studies, plants respond to blue-light photostimulation positively (growth towards the light) in shoots, and negatively (growth away from the light source) in roots (Kutschera and Briggs 2012; Briggs 2014; Liscum et al. 2014). Recently, a positive red-light-based phototropic response in roots mediated by phytochromes has been observed and characterized (Kiss et al. 2003; Molas and Kiss 2008), in addition to positive hypocotyl phototropic response to red light in the conditions of microgravity (Millar et al. 2010). However, the magnitude of phototropic response is less during red-light stimulation compared with the robust response to blue light. In terms of gravitropic response, in general, plants respond to the gravity vector by growing roots in the direction of gravity, and shoots opposite of the gravity vector. The amalgamation of tropistic movements results in the overall direction and form of plant growth (Correll and Kiss 2002). Plants utilize both gravity and light cues to direct plant growth and development. In addition to directing root growth towards the gravity vector, sunlight can penetrate the soil up to several millimeters beneath the soil surface, having a direct effect on the growth and development of roots (Woolley and Stoller 1978; Tester and Morris 1987). The red and far-red part of the light spectrum can penetrate to greater depths than blue light (Mandoli and Briggs 1984) which has led to plants evolving blue-light receptors located near the upper portion of roots and red-light receptors near the apices due to this pattern of light penetration (Mo et al. 2015). In addition, it has been shown that plants utilize blue-light cues to control root architectural features, such as lateral root growth (Moni et al. 2015). Light perception by the roots may also impact plant growth and development elsewhere, as light signals sensed by root apices have also been shown to have an effect on shoot gravitropic response (Hopkins and Kiss 2012). Taken together, these observations suggest that light perception within the root plays a dynamic role in plant development. Specifically, an effect of light irradiation on shortening the root length has been reported (Silva-Navas et al. 2015), although other works have shown higher rates of root elongation under light-grown conditions (Laxmi et al. 2008). Modulation of cell-cycle progression by photoreceptors in meristems is well known, but there are data indicating that this action of light is different in the root and in the shoot meristems (López-Juez et al. 2008; Silva-Navas et al. 2015). To perceive light stimuli, plants contain specialized photoreceptor proteins specific to red, blue, and UV-B light. Plants sense blue light via two types of light receptors: cryptochromes and phototropins. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, PHOT1 and PHOT2 (Christie et al. 1999), and two cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2 (Christie et al. 2014). In addition, red-light perception is carried out by phytochromes, while UV-B perception is carried out by protein UVR8 (Brown and Jenkins 2008). In addition to regulating phototropic growth, phytochromes have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes, from seed germination to plant senescence. To date, five phytochromes have been identified in Arabidopsis, and all have been linked to phototropistic response (Correll et al. 2003; Kiss et al. 2003; Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004; Kumar et al. 2008). The relationship between phototropism and gravitropism is a complex, poorly characterized interaction, where the direction of growth is an amalgamation of the two processes. To isolate phototropic response to a directional light source, the confounding gravity vector must first be removed. The utilization of facilities on board the International Space Station (ISS) provides the ability to conduct experiments in an environment of near-weightlessness, allowing for the study of “pure” phototropism, in the absence of a gravitropic response (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). Specifically, using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus module of the ISS provides the ability to study phototropic response to red or blue light in the absence of a unidirectional gravity vector. While plant growth and development in microgravity environments has been well characterized, considerably less is known about plant growth and development in fractional or reduced gravity environments (less than the nominal 1g; Kiss 2014). The EMCS contains a centrifuge which allows for the creation of gravity vectors to better characterize the interplay between gravitropism and phototropism. Our previous space experiments examined the phototropic response to red and blue light in microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g, and 1g environments (Kiss et al. 2012), providing insight on how plant growth and development may be effected on the Moon or Mars. Understanding how plants grow and develop in fractional gravity environment is an important step in successful habitation of the Moon or Mars. Furthermore, fractional gravity studies are helpful for the determination of thresholds of the gravity sensing and response of plants. In this study, we utilize micro-gravity as well as a continuum of fractional gravity (μ-g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, and 1g) to better characterize the phototropic responses to red and blue light. In addition, we analyze the effects of a brief, red-light pretreatment on blue-light-based phototropism.",

    "results": "Results The aim of this study was to investigate phototropism under a continuum of gravity conditions from microgravity, to partial (reduced) gravity, to 1g. Arabidopsis roots and shoots exhibit markedly different phototropic curvatures in different gravity conditions upon exposure to red or blue light. Initially, plants were grown for 96 h with unilateral white light and simulated 1g in an attempt to standardize the orientation of all seedlings (Fig. 2). During photostimulation, gravity levels of 0g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, or 1g were generated via centrifugation. Images taken prior to directional light photostimulation allowed assessment of seedling growth and development (Fig. 1). Seedlings with slow germination or improper development were excluded from analyses. The phototropic response in roots was measured as positive growth (towards photostimulation) or negative growth (away from photostimulation) from the initial vertical state. Multiple regression analysis of root phototropic response found significant effects from gravity (P <2.2 × 10−16), light quality (P <2.74 × 10−15), and position (P < 2.08 × 10−9). Genotype also had a significant effect on phototropic response in root (P = 0.02; Table S3). The phototropic response of roots grown in blue light demonstrates a novel, positive phototropic response under microgravity (Figs. 3, 4). This response was attenuated at 0.1g, and is not present at higher gravity levels. In plants pretreated with red light for 1 h and subsequently exposed to blue light (Fig. 5), roots experience greater phototropic response (larger angles) when compared with blue-light exposure. Similar to blue-light root phototropism, the response is attenuated at 0.1g and not present in higher gravity levels. Finally, we observe a positive root phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 6), and the positive phototropic curvature decreases steadily as the magnitude of gravity increases.

Open in a new tab Phototropic response in roots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. The positive phototropic response to red light in roots exhibits an inverse relationship with magnitude of the gravity vector Similarly, multiple regression analysis was conducted for hypocotyls. Arabidopsis hypocotyls displayed significant effects from light (P < 2.2 × 10−16), genotype (P <0.05) and position (P < 4.9 × 10−5). However, no significant effect was detected for gravity (P = 0.055; Table S4). Not surprisingly, on Earth, the phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue-light phototropism shows a robust response immediately upon stimulation, followed by cessation once the hypocotyl reaches ~90° (Fig. 7). This same trend is also exhibited in hypocotyls of plants initially pretreated with red light and subsequent illuminated with blue light (Fig. 8). There is no significant gravity effect on the phototropic response in red light pretreated or blue light illuminated hypocotyls. In hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to red light, we observe a positive phototropic curvature in plants exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 9). Unlike hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to blue light, red-light exposure causes a steady positive phototropic response over time. However, similar to hypocotyls exposed to blue light, there is no significant effect of gravity on phototropic curvature. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to unilateral blue light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. Positive phototropic response of shoots to blue light is not significantly affected by gravity Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to blue light preceded by a 1-h red pretreatment in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. Positive phototropic response of shoots to blue light is not enhanced by 1-h red-light pretreatment Fig. 9. Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment Seedling position within the cassette also was shown to have a significant effect on phototropic curvature in both hypocotyls and roots. This is likely due to the variation in light intensity experienced within the seedling cassettes. Blue-light intensity decreases significantly the further the plant is from the light (Suppl. Fig. S1) ranging from 41.5 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position furthest from the LED. A similar trend is seen in red-light intensity, with illumination ranging from 59.6 μmol m−2 s−1 of light nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 furthest from the LED (Suppl. Fig. S2). To study the effects of microgravity on overall growth, we measured root and shoot lengths during the period of photostimulation. ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test of root (Table 1) and shoot (Table 2) total growth indicate that there are no significant differences in growth between microgravity and 1-g treatments. In addition, Pearson’s correlations were conducted to determine if overall growth was significantly correlated with phototropic curvature of seedlings. The correlation between total root growth and rate of root curvature was not significant (r = 0.20, P = 0.14), suggesting no relationship between root growth and curvature. However, in hypocotyls, the correlation between shoot growth and curvature was significant (r = 0.31, P = 0.02), suggesting that total shoot growth has an impact on rate of shoot curvature.

    "discussion": "Discussion Continued technical improvements to space experiments on plant tropisms Results from these experiments expand upon and optimize the previous experiments performed under conditions of microgravity and reduced gravity on board the ISS (Table 3). During the TROPI-1 series of experiments, germination rates were severely hampered by excess stowage time (>8 months) of the seeds prior to the activation of the experiment in space (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). During TROPI-2, we found that reducing the stowage time of seeds (<3 months) resulted in a dramatic increase in seed germination (Kiss et al. 2009). In addition, it was discovered after the conclusion of the TROPI experiments that utilization of the EMCS’s two-rotor setup resulted in a slight light contamination between the two rotors, which may have caused non-unidirectional light sources (Kiss et al. 2014). The current seedling growth set of experiments were conducted utilizing a single rotor of the EMCS to remove the possibility of between-rotor light contamination and have been optimized in many other ways (Table 3). The large range in sample sizes (6–50) of the various conditions was a product of multiple factors. Due to limited space, the design of the experiment necessitated an unbalanced experimental design, where half as many plants were grown under blue light or were pretreated with red light. In addition, there was reduced germination during the second spaceflight experiment for the Ler WT and PhyA genotypes. The reduction in germination in likely due to the extended period of time the seeds remained in hardware prior to spaceflight, as germination counts during flight build were in excess of 85 % (data not shown). Reducing the time between hardware build and execution of the experiment can help to increase germination rates and to maximize scientific return of space-flight experiments. Phototropic responses in roots Under the conditions of microgravity, a novel positive blue-light phototropic response was observed in roots of seedlings (Figs. 3, 4). While blue-light-based negative phototropism in roots has been extensively characterized in ground studies (Correll and Kiss 2002), this positive phototropic response is greatly reduced at 0.1g, and effectively negated at 0.3g and higher gravity levels. To date, this phototropic response has not previously been observed in the roots of Arabidopsis. This observation suggests that positive phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots is masked by the much more robust gravitropic response in Earth normal conditions, and the response can only be observed when the gravity vector is greatly reduced or eliminated, as can be observed in space experiments in orbiting vehicles. Interestingly, the relationship between the blue-light-positive phototropic response and gravity appears to represent a threshold model, where gravity levels between 0g and 0.1g eliminate the blue positive phototropic response. Interestingly, the previous clinorotation studies conducted by our group did not demonstrate positive phototropic curvature of roots when exposed to blue light. This observation suggests that while informative and beneficial, clinorotation studies are not a perfect proxy for actual microgravity, and further highlights the need for true spaceflight experiments. In addition to the blue-light phototropic response, a 1-h red-light pretreatment, followed by continuous blue illumination was tested (Fig. 5). Similar to the blue-light exposure only phototropic response revealed in roots, red-light pretreated roots exhibited an immediate and robust response in the direction of the blue-light photostimulus. The magnitude of the total positive phototropic curvature was at least 25 % greater in roots exposed to red-light pretreatment compared with those exposed solely to blue light. These results are not unexpected, as the previous studies of Arabidopsis have shown that etiolated (dark-grown) seedlings exposed to red-light pretreatment experience an increase in the blue-light phototropic response (Sakai and Haga 2012; Goyal et al. 2013). In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that overhead pretreatment with blue-light illumination also enhances the phototropic response (Sullivan et al. 2016). It has been proposed that this effect is due to red, far red, and blue light all acting together as an activator of phytochrome A, which leads to enhancement of the phototropic response (Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004). However, it is interesting to note that we do not see a significant difference in phototropic response in phyA mutants when compared with the wild type. This observation suggests that phytochrome A does not contribute to enhancement of blue-light positive phototropic response in roots. In addition, there is no apparent effect of genotype on the overall magnitude of phototropic response of roots pretreated with red light. A similar attenuation of positive phototropic curvature at 0.1g is also exhibited under red-light pretreatment when compared with non-pretreated samples. Cessation of curvature appears as a similar thresholding response between 0g and 0.1g, which negates positive phototropic curvature in red-light pretreated samples. As noted in our previous space experiments (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012), plant roots exposed to illumination with red light also experienced positive phototropic curvature (Fig. 6). The positive phototropic response is confirmed and is similar to what has previously been characterized during the TROPI experiments, however, the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature is greater than in the previous results (Kiss et al. 2012). Interestingly, two distinctions exist when comparing the root phototropic response to red vs. blue light. First, the positive phototropic curvature in response to red light is not eliminated at the onset of gravitational acceleration. Rather, it appears that the rate of root positive phototropic curvature is inversely correlated with the magnitude of the gravity vector, with the largest magnitude of curvature being experienced in seedlings exposed to microgravity. Second, there appears to be a genotype-specific effect at low gravity conditions, where the WT shows much higher levels of positive phototropic curvature when compared with phytochrome mutant varieties. However, this genotype effect appears to be negated at gravity levels of 0.5g and greater. Comparison of the root phototropic responses to red light and blue light reveals unique patterns between the two treatments. Utilization of fractional or reduced gravity conditions allowed for the identification of gravity levels that correspond with an attenuation of response, which differed between the two light treatments. Interestingly, a threshold value of 0.1–0.3g is enough to cease phototropic curvature in roots illuminated with blue light; however, this same threshold is not observed in red light, which exhibits something akin to a gravity dose response. This difference in response suggests that the mechanisms controlling the interaction between gravitropic response and phototropic response are different for red and blue light. In addition, the enhancement of the blue-light phototropic response in roots after red-light pretreatment suggests that while the two responses differ in pattern and potentially, mechanisms, there is still an additive effect that causes an enhancement to total phototropic curvature. The notion of positive blue-light phototropism in roots tends to contradict the traditional understanding of phototropic function, where roots move in the opposite direction of blue light to grow deeper into soil. However, these observed differences in phototropism between 1g and μg in Arabidopsis may reflect the evolutionary history of plants. For instance, plants from older evolutionary lineages, such as mosses and ferns, have a very versatile directional response to both red and blue light (Kiss 1994; Wada 2007; Li and Mathews 2016). Thus, microgravity may reveal mechanisms of phototropism that are normally masked by Earth nominal gravity conditions. It is possible that the near-linear relationship between red-light phototropic response and gravity in roots is a result of cytosolic calcium ions which have been thought to play a key role in the transmission of gravity sensing (Poovaiah et al. 1987; Gilroy et al. 1993; Correll et al. 2013), potentially through regulating the distribution of auxin and auxin transporters within the root cells (Benjamins et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2011; Shih et al. 2015). A study conducted by Toyota et al. (2013) utilized parabolic flight to examine the effects of reduced gravity gradients on calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This study examined the gravitropic response to gravity vectors ranging from 0.5g to 2.0g and found intercellular Ca2+ signaling exhibits a near-linear relationship with gravistimulation. This linear relationship between gravity sensing and Ca2+ signaling is the inverse of the observed red-light-induced phototropic curvature in roots observed in our present study, suggesting a potential antagonistic relationship with the root red-light phototropic response mechanisms. A recent study also utilized parabolic flights to examine cytosolic calcium levels on Arabidopsis cell cultures (Neef et al. 2015). In addition, this report demonstrated a clear link between several known Ca2+ inhibitors/antagonists and changes in cytosolic calcium due to gravity. However, this study also identified a single Ca2+ (nifedipine) inhibitor that had no effect on calcium signaling, suggesting the possibility of unique calcium channels or pumps involved in gravity signaling. It is possible that a gradual reduction in cytosolic calcium levels is responsible for the decreased positive phototropic response associated with increasing gravity. Phototropic responses in hypocotyls As in ground studies, plant hypocotyls exposed to continuous blue-light illumination showed an immediate and robust positive phototropic response in the direction of the light stimulus, followed by continuous growth at 90° in the direction of the light source (Fig. 7). As expected, there is no statistically significant effect of genotype on the phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to blue light. Gravity also did not have a significant effect on the direction, response time, or magnitude of hypocotyl phototropic curvature in response to unidirectional blue-light illumination. However, we do see a significant statistical correlation between the distances of the seedling from the light source, and the rate of positive phototropic curvature. These results correspond to our previous characterization of blue-light phototropic response in hypocotyls, where no increase in curvature was observed when exposed to microgravity conditions (Kiss et al. 2012). Red-light pretreatment of seedlings exposed to blue light did not result in an observable increase in the rate of positive phototropic response, and the pattern of phototropic curvature mirrored those seedlings that were not exposed to red-light pretreatment (Fig. 8). Interestingly, a recent study found that curvature enhancements stemming from red- or blue-light pretreatments were affected by light intensity, where higher fluence rates of the directional light caused a reduction in phototropic curvature (Sullivan et al. 2016). It is possible that enhancement of phototropic curvature was not observed in this case due to fluence rates that were high enough to inhibit the enhancement of curvature. In addition, it is possible that due to the rapid phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue light, we were unable to capture differences in curvature rate from the frequency of images we obtained (every 30 min). Increasing the rate of image capture (e.g., every 5 min) would likely help to identify enhancements in phototropic curvature of hypocotyls pretreated with red light. Analyses of seedlings grown in microgravity conditions and exposed to red light (Fig. 9) have confirmed previously characterized positive phototropic curvature of Arabidopsis hypocotyls (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). This positive hypocotyl curvature was previously characterized during the TROPI experiment series, however, it must be noted that the magnitude of the positive phototropic curvatures is less than what was measured during TROPI-2 (Kiss et al. 2012). These results are similar in magnitude and in accordance with results obtained from the TROPI-1 experiment (Millar et al. 2010). These differences can likely be attributed to the light contamination between rotors in the earlier experiments (Kiss et al. 2014), as all other conditions within the experiment were unaltered. In addition, the magnitude of positive hypocotyl phototropism when exposed to red light does not appear to be contingent on the gravity vector, whereas the previous study found a significant difference in rates of phototropic curvature in hypocotyls exposed to low gravity (μg or 0.1g) versus more substantial gravity vectors (0.3g or 1g). Previously, positive phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to red light was shown to be enhanced in phyB mutants when compared with phyA and WT varieties (Kiss et al. 2012). However, as all three genotypes tested show positive phototropic responses that were not significantly different, these results were not reproduced in this study. Again, we attribute these differences to the fact that we have improved the experimental conditions in this report by eliminating the stray light between rotors in the current studies. Phototropic responses and illumination intensity Multiple regression analyses of phototropic curvature in both roots and shoots revealed position as a significant variable that predicts the rate of phototropic curvature. This effect is due to the observed differences in illumination across the membrane as the distance from the light source increases (Suppl. Fig. S1 and S2). Therefore, within a cassette where all seedlings are exposed to directional light for the same duration, seedlings furthest from the light source receive reduced fluency from the lights, and, in turn, exhibit reduced phototropic curvature. However, while the magnitude of curvature differed significantly across fluence rates, the overall proportional trend in curvature was conserved. The relationship between fluence rates and phototropic curvature is well characterized (Janoudi and Poff 1990; Sakai et al. 2001). Traditionally, illumination and curvature of hypocotyls follow the Bunsen-Roscoe law, where curvature is a product of illumination intensity and the duration of exposure (Bunsen and Roscoe 1863). However, the previous studies characterizing phototropic response have reported that this relationship ceases to be valid at illumination intensities of greater than 0.01 μmol m−2 (Janoudi and Poff 1990), well below the light intensity used in this study. In addition, illumination intensity has previously been shown to have no effect on phototropic curvature of hypocotyls of WT seedlings (Sakai et al. 2001). It also is possible that the significant effect of position on phototropic curvature is the result of the use of non-etiolated seedlings, which our previous spaceflight studies utilized.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions In this study, we characterize a novel blue-light phototropism that is present in microgravity, but is attenuated at low (0.1–0.3g) gravity levels. One-hour red-light pre-treatment followed by blue-light illumination enhanced the rate of positive phototropic curvature in roots. In addition, positive phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red-light was observed; however, increasing levels of gravity causes a gradual reduction in the magnitude of curvature as opposed to the drastic cessation observed under blue-light exposure. The red-light phototropic response of hypocotyls in microgravity, which we have previously characterized, was also confirmed. In addition, the present report shows the value of repetition of space experiments as is usual in ground experiments (Kiss 2015). In the first experiments (TROPI-1 and TROPI-2), we encountered a number of technical issues and obstacles (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). In the more recent Seedling Growth experiments, we were able to solve the technical issues and overcome the limitations of the previous projects (Table 3; Kiss et al. 2014). Thus, in this better controlled light environment in the EMCS, we were able to make new discoveries on the positive phototropism of roots in response to blue light that has added to the previous reports of novel mechanisms of red-light sensing that has been revealed in microgravity. It is clear that effectively removing the ubiquitous gravity vector in spaceflight experiments allows researchers to better understand the myriad of phototropic responses in plants.",

In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity. Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1g. A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities. Keywords: Arabidopsis, Fractional gravity, Microgravity, Phototropism, Reduced gravity, SpaceflightIntroduction Plant tropisms are growth-mediated movements relative to the direction of an external stimulus. In early studies, these movements were first characterized by Darwin and Darwin (1880), however, description of plant movement actually dates back to the Ancient Romans (Ovid 8 AD 2008). Plants exhibit these growth-mediated responses to external cues, including water (hydrotropism, Kiss 2007), touch or contact (thigmotropism, Braam 2005), the sun or light (heliotropism and phototropism, respectively Briggs 1964; Vandenbrink et al. 2014a, b; Kutschera and Briggs 2016), and gravity (gravitropism, Chen et al. 1999; Kiss 2000) among others. Tropisms are important for plants, which as sessile organisms, utilize these movements to respond to external stimuli (Kaufman et al. 1987; Whippo and Hangarter 2004). Typically, in ground studies, plants respond to blue-light photostimulation positively (growth towards the light) in shoots, and negatively (growth away from the light source) in roots (Kutschera and Briggs 2012; Briggs 2014; Liscum et al. 2014). Recently, a positive red-light-based phototropic response in roots mediated by phytochromes has been observed and characterized (Kiss et al. 2003; Molas and Kiss 2008), in addition to positive hypocotyl phototropic response to red light in the conditions of microgravity (Millar et al. 2010). However, the magnitude of phototropic response is less during red-light stimulation compared with the robust response to blue light. In terms of gravitropic response, in general, plants respond to the gravity vector by growing roots in the direction of gravity, and shoots opposite of the gravity vector. The amalgamation of tropistic movements results in the overall direction and form of plant growth (Correll and Kiss 2002). Plants utilize both gravity and light cues to direct plant growth and development. In addition to directing root growth towards the gravity vector, sunlight can penetrate the soil up to several millimeters beneath the soil surface, having a direct effect on the growth and development of roots (Woolley and Stoller 1978; Tester and Morris 1987). The red and far-red part of the light spectrum can penetrate to greater depths than blue light (Mandoli and Briggs 1984) which has led to plants evolving blue-light receptors located near the upper portion of roots and red-light receptors near the apices due to this pattern of light penetration (Mo et al. 2015). In addition, it has been shown that plants utilize blue-light cues to control root architectural features, such as lateral root growth (Moni et al. 2015). Light perception by the roots may also impact plant growth and development elsewhere, as light signals sensed by root apices have also been shown to have an effect on shoot gravitropic response (Hopkins and Kiss 2012). Taken together, these observations suggest that light perception within the root plays a dynamic role in plant development. Specifically, an effect of light irradiation on shortening the root length has been reported (Silva-Navas et al. 2015), although other works have shown higher rates of root elongation under light-grown conditions (Laxmi et al. 2008). Modulation of cell-cycle progression by photoreceptors in meristems is well known, but there are data indicating that this action of light is different in the root and in the shoot meristems (López-Juez et al. 2008; Silva-Navas et al. 2015). To perceive light stimuli, plants contain specialized photoreceptor proteins specific to red, blue, and UV-B light. Plants sense blue light via two types of light receptors: cryptochromes and phototropins. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, PHOT1 and PHOT2 (Christie et al. 1999), and two cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2 (Christie et al. 2014). In addition, red-light perception is carried out by phytochromes, while UV-B perception is carried out by protein UVR8 (Brown and Jenkins 2008). In addition to regulating phototropic growth, phytochromes have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes, from seed germination to plant senescence. To date, five phytochromes have been identified in Arabidopsis, and all have been linked to phototropistic response (Correll et al. 2003; Kiss et al. 2003; Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004; Kumar et al. 2008). The relationship between phototropism and gravitropism is a complex, poorly characterized interaction, where the direction of growth is an amalgamation of the two processes. To isolate phototropic response to a directional light source, the confounding gravity vector must first be removed. The utilization of facilities on board the International Space Station (ISS) provides the ability to conduct experiments in an environment of near-weightlessness, allowing for the study of “pure” phototropism, in the absence of a gravitropic response (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). Specifically, using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus module of the ISS provides the ability to study phototropic response to red or blue light in the absence of a unidirectional gravity vector. While plant growth and development in microgravity environments has been well characterized, considerably less is known about plant growth and development in fractional or reduced gravity environments (less than the nominal 1g; Kiss 2014). The EMCS contains a centrifuge which allows for the creation of gravity vectors to better characterize the interplay between gravitropism and phototropism. Our previous space experiments examined the phototropic response to red and blue light in microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g, and 1g environments (Kiss et al. 2012), providing insight on how plant growth and development may be effected on the Moon or Mars. Understanding how plants grow and develop in fractional gravity environment is an important step in successful habitation of the Moon or Mars. Furthermore, fractional gravity studies are helpful for the determination of thresholds of the gravity sensing and response of plants. In this study, we utilize micro-gravity as well as a continuum of fractional gravity (μ-g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, and 1g) to better characterize the phototropic responses to red and blue light. In addition, we analyze the effects of a brief, red-light pretreatment on blue-light-based phototropism.Materials and methods Plant materials and the spaceflight experiment Three genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana were utilized for this study (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA): wild-type ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler), and the phytochrome mutant’s phyA-201 and phyB-1 (Kiss et al. 2003). Space-flight studies were conducted utilizing the EMCS on the ISS. The EMCS consists of two centrifuges with atmosphere regulation, including ethylene removal, as well as remote hydration control (Brinckmann and Schiller 2002; Brinckmann 2005; Kiss et al. 2014). The utilization of the onboard centrifuge provides an important control with the ability to separate microgravity effects from the other environmental conditions associated with spaceflight (Vandenbrink and Kiss 2016). The EMCS also contains a Sony FCB-IX470 video camera for image acquisition. This experiment was conducted in two parts, with the first set of seedlings being transferred to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-2 (March 2013) followed by return via CRS-3, and the second set being carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (September 2015). Two sets of experimental runs were performed, the first set during ISS increments 35–36, and the second during ISS increment 41.Space hardware and procedures Hardware utilized in this experiment has previously been described (Correll and Kiss 2005; Kiss et al. 2009). Briefly, each experimental container (EC) holds five individual seedling growth cassettes with an LED light source (white, red and blue; Fig. 1). Before flight, seeds were surface sterilized in ethanol and air dried under a laminar flow. The seedling growth media contain 50 % (w/v) Murashige and Skoog salts with 1-mM Mes buffer (pH 5.5). Whatman # 17filter paper was soaked in media and allowed to dry.Seeds were attached to a black gridded nitrocellulose membrane via 1 % (w/v) gum guar. Five seedling cassettes were placed into each EC and stored until launch (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Images of seedlings in cassettes in an EC during a spaceflight experiment run in the EMCS.

White arrows labeled g and L represent the direction of gravity and light vectors, respectivelyProcedures during the spaceflight experiment Experimental containers (Ecs) were transferred to the EMCS on the ISS as described in Kiss et al. (2014). Briefly, experimental conditions were controlled telemetrically from the Norwegian User Support and Operations Centre (N-USOC, Trondheim, Norway), and the initiation of the experiment was conducted via hydration of the seeds. Plants were grown under six gravity conditions: microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, and 1.0g. Seedlings were initially grown under white light (30–40 μmol m−2 s−1) for 96 h, followed by unidirectional photostimulation with red light, blue light, or red → blue light (Fig. 2). Directional photostimulation occurred for 48 h. Illumination intensity throughout the cassette was measured for both blue (Suppl. Fig. S1) and red light (Suppl. Fig. S2) with a Li-Cor LI-189 Quantum Radiometer Photometer. After conclusion of the experiments, seedlings were frozen and stored at −80 °C on the ISS. This manuscript presents the results of image analyses, and future papers will consider the gene experiment profile obtained from the frozen seedlings. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Timeline of operations for the seedling growth experimentsImage and data analyses Growth and curvature of seedlings were measured using the program ImageJ (v.1.50e). Curvature was measured as change in degrees from starting position (defined as 0°). Angles were measured at the initiation of directional red or blue light and subsequently every 30 min for a total of 48.5 h. The number of samples measured for growth and angle per treatment ranged from 6 to 50 and are indicated in Tables S1 and S2. Positive curvature values were defined as growth in the direction of stimulus, and negative curvature was defined as growth away from the stimulus. Analysis of growth and curvature for each genotype was conducted utilizing linear regression of growth rate using the program R 64-bit (version 3.1.3). Regression coefficients compared via one-way ANOVA and subsequent Tukey’s honest significant difference test (P <0.05) were used to identify significant differences between plant growth rates. Data analyses were conducted via linear regression and subsequent ANOVA in R (3.1.3) using the car, multcomp, and agricolae packages. The multiple test correction was conducted using Tukey’s honest significance test (P <0.05). Multiple regression analysis was performed utilizing the following response variables: light-red, blue, or a 1 h red pretreatment before continuous blue illumination; genotype—Ler wild-type, or phytochrome mutants phyA and phyB; gravity—a continuum ranging from 0g/microgravity to 1g; and seedling position—ranging 1–14, with 1 being closes to the source of illumination and 14 the furthest.Results The aim of this study was to investigate phototropism under a continuum of gravity conditions from microgravity, to partial (reduced) gravity, to 1g. Arabidopsis roots and shoots exhibit markedly different phototropic curvatures in different gravity conditions upon exposure to red or blue light. Initially, plants were grown for 96 h with unilateral white light and simulated 1g in an attempt to standardize the orientation of all seedlings (Fig. 2). During photostimulation, gravity levels of 0g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, or 1g were generated via centrifugation. Images taken prior to directional light photostimulation allowed assessment of seedling growth and development (Fig. 1). Seedlings with slow germination or improper development were excluded from analyses. The phototropic response in roots was measured as positive growth (towards photostimulation) or negative growth (away from photostimulation) from the initial vertical state. Multiple regression analysis of root phototropic response found significant effects from gravity (P <2.2 × 10−16), light quality (P <2.74 × 10−15), and position (P < 2.08 × 10−9). Genotype also had a significant effect on phototropic response in root (P = 0.02; Table S3). The phototropic response of roots grown in blue light demonstrates a novel, positive phototropic response under microgravity (Figs. 3, 4). This response was attenuated at 0.1g, and is not present at higher gravity levels. In plants pretreated with red light for 1 h and subsequently exposed to blue light (Fig. 5), roots experience greater phototropic response (larger angles) when compared with blue-light exposure. Similar to blue-light root phototropism, the response is attenuated at 0.1g and not present in higher gravity levels. Finally, we observe a positive root phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 6), and the positive phototropic curvature decreases steadily as the magnitude of gravity increases.

Open in a new tab Phototropic response in roots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. The positive phototropic response to red light in roots exhibits an inverse relationship with magnitude of the gravity vectorSimilarly, multiple regression analysis was conducted for hypocotyls. Arabidopsis hypocotyls displayed significant effects from light (P < 2.2 × 10−16), genotype (P <0.05) and position (P < 4.9 × 10−5). However, no significant effect was detected for gravity (P = 0.055; Table S4). Not surprisingly, on Earth, the phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue-light phototropism shows a robust response immediately upon stimulation, followed by cessation once the hypocotyl reaches ~90° (Fig. 7). This same trend is also exhibited in hypocotyls of plants initially pretreated with red light and subsequent illuminated with blue light (Fig. 8). There is no significant gravity effect on the phototropic response in red light pretreated or blue light illuminated hypocotyls. In hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to red light, we observe a positive phototropic curvature in plants exposed to red light (Figs. 1, 9). Unlike hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to blue light, red-light exposure causes a steady positive phototropic response over time. However, similar to hypocotyls exposed to blue light, there is no significant effect of gravity on phototropic curvature. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to unilateral blue light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. Positive phototropic response of shoots to blue light is not significantly affected by gravityFig. 8.

Positive phototropic response of shoots to blue light is not enhanced by 1-h red-light pretreatmentFig. 9. Open in a new tab Phototropic response in shoots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experimentSeedling position within the cassette also was shown to have a significant effect on phototropic curvature in both hypocotyls and roots. This is likely due to the variation in light intensity experienced within the seedling cassettes. Blue-light intensity decreases significantly the further the plant is from the light (Suppl. Fig. S1) ranging from 41.5 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 at the position furthest from the LED. A similar trend is seen in red-light intensity, with illumination ranging from 59.6 μmol m−2 s−1 of light nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2 s−1 furthest from the LED (Suppl. Fig. S2). To study the effects of microgravity on overall growth, we measured root and shoot lengths during the period of photostimulation. ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test of root (Table 1) and shoot (Table 2) total growth indicate that there are no significant differences in growth between microgravity and 1-g treatments. In addition, Pearson’s correlations were conducted to determine if overall growth was significantly correlated with phototropic curvature of seedlings. The correlation between total root growth and rate of root curvature was not significant (r = 0.20, P = 0.14), suggesting no relationship between root growth and curvature. However, in hypocotyls, the correlation between shoot growth and curvature was significant (r = 0.31, P = 0.02), suggesting that total shoot growth has an impact on rate of shoot curvature.

During the TROPI-1 series of experiments, germination rates were severely hampered by excess stowage time (>8 months) of the seeds prior to the activation of the experiment in space (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). During TROPI-2, we found that reducing the stowage time of seeds (<3 months) resulted in a dramatic increase in seed germination (Kiss et al. 2009). In addition, it was discovered after the conclusion of the TROPI experiments that utilization of the EMCS’s two-rotor setup resulted in a slight light contamination between the two rotors, which may have caused non-unidirectional light sources (Kiss et al. 2014). The current seedling growth set of experiments were conducted utilizing a single rotor of the EMCS to remove the possibility of between-rotor light contamination and have been optimized in many other ways (Table 3). The large range in sample sizes (6–50) of the various conditions was a product of multiple factors. Due to limited space, the design of the experiment necessitated an unbalanced experimental design, where half as many plants were grown under blue light or were pretreated with red light. In addition, there was reduced germination during the second spaceflight experiment for the Ler WT and PhyA genotypes. The reduction in germination in likely due to the extended period of time the seeds remained in hardware prior to spaceflight, as germination counts during flight build were in excess of 85 % (data not shown). Reducing the time between hardware build and execution of the experiment can help to increase germination rates and to maximize scientific return of space-flight experiments.Phototropic responses in roots Under the conditions of microgravity, a novel positive blue-light phototropic response was observed in roots of seedlings (Figs. 3, 4). While blue-light-based negative phototropism in roots has been extensively characterized in ground studies (Correll and Kiss 2002), this positive phototropic response is greatly reduced at 0.1g, and effectively negated at 0.3g and higher gravity levels. To date, this phototropic response has not previously been observed in the roots of Arabidopsis. This observation suggests that positive phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots is masked by the much more robust gravitropic response in Earth normal conditions, and the response can only be observed when the gravity vector is greatly reduced or eliminated, as can be observed in space experiments in orbiting vehicles. Interestingly, the relationship between the blue-light-positive phototropic response and gravity appears to represent a threshold model, where gravity levels between 0g and 0.1g eliminate the blue positive phototropic response. Interestingly, the previous clinorotation studies conducted by our group did not demonstrate positive phototropic curvature of roots when exposed to blue light. This observation suggests that while informative and beneficial, clinorotation studies are not a perfect proxy for actual microgravity, and further highlights the need for true spaceflight experiments. In addition to the blue-light phototropic response, a 1-h red-light pretreatment, followed by continuous blue illumination was tested (Fig. 5). Similar to the blue-light exposure only phototropic response revealed in roots, red-light pretreated roots exhibited an immediate and robust response in the direction of the blue-light photostimulus. The magnitude of the total positive phototropic curvature was at least 25 % greater in roots exposed to red-light pretreatment compared with those exposed solely to blue light. These results are not unexpected, as the previous studies of Arabidopsis have shown that etiolated (dark-grown) seedlings exposed to red-light pretreatment experience an increase in the blue-light phototropic response (Sakai and Haga 2012; Goyal et al. 2013). In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that overhead pretreatment with blue-light illumination also enhances the phototropic response (Sullivan et al. 2016). It has been proposed that this effect is due to red, far red, and blue light all acting together as an activator of phytochrome A, which leads to enhancement of the phototropic response (Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004). However, it is interesting to note that we do not see a significant difference in phototropic response in phyA mutants when compared with the wild type. This observation suggests that phytochrome A does not contribute to enhancement of blue-light positive phototropic response in roots. In addition, there is no apparent effect of genotype on the overall magnitude of phototropic response of roots pretreated with red light. A similar attenuation of positive phototropic curvature at 0.1g is also exhibited under red-light pretreatment when compared with non-pretreated samples. Cessation of curvature appears as a similar thresholding response between 0g and 0.1g, which negates positive phototropic curvature in red-light pretreated samples. As noted in our previous space experiments (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012), plant roots exposed to illumination with red light also experienced positive phototropic curvature (Fig. 6). The positive phototropic response is confirmed and is similar to what has previously been characterized during the TROPI experiments, however, the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature is greater than in the previous results (Kiss et al. 2012). Interestingly, two distinctions exist when comparing the root phototropic response to red vs. blue light. First, the positive phototropic curvature in response to red light is not eliminated at the onset of gravitational acceleration. Rather, it appears that the rate of root positive phototropic curvature is inversely correlated with the magnitude of the gravity vector, with the largest magnitude of curvature being experienced in seedlings exposed to microgravity. Second, there appears to be a genotype-specific effect at low gravity conditions, where the WT shows much higher levels of positive phototropic curvature when compared with phytochrome mutant varieties. However, this genotype effect appears to be negated at gravity levels of 0.5g and greater. Comparison of the root phototropic responses to red light and blue light reveals unique patterns between the two treatments. Utilization of fractional or reduced gravity conditions allowed for the identification of gravity levels that correspond with an attenuation of response, which differed between the two light treatments. Interestingly, a threshold value of 0.1–0.3g is enough to cease phototropic curvature in roots illuminated with blue light; however, this same threshold is not observed in red light, which exhibits something akin to a gravity dose response. This difference in response suggests that the mechanisms controlling the interaction between gravitropic response and phototropic response are different for red and blue light. In addition, the enhancement of the blue-light phototropic response in roots after red-light pretreatment suggests that while the two responses differ in pattern and potentially, mechanisms, there is still an additive effect that causes an enhancement to total phototropic curvature. The notion of positive blue-light phototropism in roots tends to contradict the traditional understanding of phototropic function, where roots move in the opposite direction of blue light to grow deeper into soil. However, these observed differences in phototropism between 1g and μg in Arabidopsis may reflect the evolutionary history of plants. For instance, plants from older evolutionary lineages, such as mosses and ferns, have a very versatile directional response to both red and blue light (Kiss 1994; Wada 2007; Li and Mathews 2016). Thus, microgravity may reveal mechanisms of phototropism that are normally masked by Earth nominal gravity conditions. It is possible that the near-linear relationship between red-light phototropic response and gravity in roots is a result of cytosolic calcium ions which have been thought to play a key role in the transmission of gravity sensing (Poovaiah et al. 1987; Gilroy et al. 1993; Correll et al. 2013), potentially through regulating the distribution of auxin and auxin transporters within the root cells (Benjamins et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2011; Shih et al. 2015). A study conducted by Toyota et al. (2013) utilized parabolic flight to examine the effects of reduced gravity gradients on calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This study examined the gravitropic response to gravity vectors ranging from 0.5g to 2.0g and found intercellular Ca2+ signaling exhibits a near-linear relationship with gravistimulation. This linear relationship between gravity sensing and Ca2+ signaling is the inverse of the observed red-light-induced phototropic curvature in roots observed in our present study, suggesting a potential antagonistic relationship with the root red-light phototropic response mechanisms. A recent study also utilized parabolic flights to examine cytosolic calcium levels on Arabidopsis cell cultures (Neef et al. 2015). In addition, this report demonstrated a clear link between several known Ca2+ inhibitors/antagonists and changes in cytosolic calcium due to gravity. However, this study also identified a single Ca2+ (nifedipine) inhibitor that had no effect on calcium signaling, suggesting the possibility of unique calcium channels or pumps involved in gravity signaling. It is possible that a gradual reduction in cytosolic calcium levels is responsible for the decreased positive phototropic response associated with increasing gravity.Phototropic responses in hypocotyls As in ground studies, plant hypocotyls exposed to continuous blue-light illumination showed an immediate and robust positive phototropic response in the direction of the light stimulus, followed by continuous growth at 90° in the direction of the light source (Fig. 7). As expected, there is no statistically significant effect of genotype on the phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to blue light. Gravity also did not have a significant effect on the direction, response time, or magnitude of hypocotyl phototropic curvature in response to unidirectional blue-light illumination. However, we do see a significant statistical correlation between the distances of the seedling from the light source, and the rate of positive phototropic curvature. These results correspond to our previous characterization of blue-light phototropic response in hypocotyls, where no increase in curvature was observed when exposed to microgravity conditions (Kiss et al. 2012). Red-light pretreatment of seedlings exposed to blue light did not result in an observable increase in the rate of positive phototropic response, and the pattern of phototropic curvature mirrored those seedlings that were not exposed to red-light pretreatment (Fig. 8). Interestingly, a recent study found that curvature enhancements stemming from red- or blue-light pretreatments were affected by light intensity, where higher fluence rates of the directional light caused a reduction in phototropic curvature (Sullivan et al. 2016). It is possible that enhancement of phototropic curvature was not observed in this case due to fluence rates that were high enough to inhibit the enhancement of curvature. In addition, it is possible that due to the rapid phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue light, we were unable to capture differences in curvature rate from the frequency of images we obtained (every 30 min). Increasing the rate of image capture (e.g., every 5 min) would likely help to identify enhancements in phototropic curvature of hypocotyls pretreated with red light. Analyses of seedlings grown in microgravity conditions and exposed to red light (Fig. 9) have confirmed previously characterized positive phototropic curvature of Arabidopsis hypocotyls (Millar et al. 2010; Kiss et al. 2012). This positive hypocotyl curvature was previously characterized during the TROPI experiment series, however, it must be noted that the magnitude of the positive phototropic curvatures is less than what was measured during TROPI-2 (Kiss et al. 2012). These results are similar in magnitude and in accordance with results obtained from the TROPI-1 experiment (Millar et al. 2010). These differences can likely be attributed to the light contamination between rotors in the earlier experiments (Kiss et al. 2014), as all other conditions within the experiment were unaltered. In addition, the magnitude of positive hypocotyl phototropism when exposed to red light does not appear to be contingent on the gravity vector, whereas the previous study found a significant difference in rates of phototropic curvature in hypocotyls exposed to low gravity (μg or 0.1g) versus more substantial gravity vectors (0.3g or 1g). Previously, positive phototropic curvature of hypocotyls exposed to red light was shown to be enhanced in phyB mutants when compared with phyA and WT varieties (Kiss et al. 2012). However, as all three genotypes tested show positive phototropic responses that were not significantly different, these results were not reproduced in this study. Again, we attribute these differences to the fact that we have improved the experimental conditions in this report by eliminating the stray light between rotors in the current studies.Phototropic responses and illumination intensity Multiple regression analyses of phototropic curvature in both roots and shoots revealed position as a significant variable that predicts the rate of phototropic curvature. This effect is due to the observed differences in illumination across the membrane as the distance from the light source increases (Suppl. Fig. S1 and S2). Therefore, within a cassette where all seedlings are exposed to directional light for the same duration, seedlings furthest from the light source receive reduced fluency from the lights, and, in turn, exhibit reduced phototropic curvature. However, while the magnitude of curvature differed significantly across fluence rates, the overall proportional trend in curvature was conserved. The relationship between fluence rates and phototropic curvature is well characterized (Janoudi and Poff 1990; Sakai et al. 2001). Traditionally, illumination and curvature of hypocotyls follow the Bunsen-Roscoe law, where curvature is a product of illumination intensity and the duration of exposure (Bunsen and Roscoe 1863). However, the previous studies characterizing phototropic response have reported that this relationship ceases to be valid at illumination intensities of greater than 0.01 μmol m−2 (Janoudi and Poff 1990), well below the light intensity used in this study. In addition, illumination intensity has previously been shown to have no effect on phototropic curvature of hypocotyls of WT seedlings (Sakai et al. 2001). It also is possible that the significant effect of position on phototropic curvature is the result of the use of non-etiolated seedlings, which our previous spaceflight studies utilized.Conclusions In this study, we characterize a novel blue-light phototropism that is present in microgravity, but is attenuated at low (0.1–0.3g) gravity levels. One-hour red-light pre-treatment followed by blue-light illumination enhanced the rate of positive phototropic curvature in roots. In addition, positive phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red-light was observed; however, increasing levels of gravity causes a gradual reduction in the magnitude of curvature as opposed to the drastic cessation observed under blue-light exposure. The red-light phototropic response of hypocotyls in microgravity, which we have previously characterized, was also confirmed. In addition, the present report shows the value of repetition of space experiments as is usual in ground experiments (Kiss 2015). In the first experiments (TROPI-1 and TROPI-2), we encountered a number of technical issues and obstacles (Kiss et al. 2009; Millar et al. 2010). In the more recent Seedling Growth experiments, we were able to solve the technical issues and overcome the limitations of the previous projects (Table 3; Kiss et al. 2014). Thus, in this better controlled light environment in the EMCS, we were able to make new discoveries on the positive phototropism of roots in response to blue light that has added to the previous reports of novel mechanisms of red-light sensing that has been revealed in microgravity. It is clear that effectively removing the ubiquitous gravity vector in spaceflight experiments allows researchers to better understand the myriad of phototropic responses in plants.Supplementary Material SuppFig1 MS926550-supplement-SuppFig1.tif (155KB, tif) SuppFig2 MS926550-supplement-SuppFig2.tif (149.8KB, tif) SuppTable1 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable1.tif (141.4KB, tif) SuppTable2 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable2.tif (146.5KB, tif) SuppTable3 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable3.tif (90.7KB, tif) SuppTable4 MS926550-supplement-SuppTable4.tif (89.3KB, tif) Acknowledgments Funding for this study was provided by NASA Grant NNX12A065G, and we would like to acknowledge the fine support of NASA’s Ames Research Center.

Keywords: gravitropism, phototropism, phytochromes, auxin, meristematic cells, cell cycle, ribosome biogenesis, space biologyINTRODUCTION Plants live in dynamic, ever-changing environments. To survive and thrive in these environments, plants have developed survival strategies to cope with the changing conditions (temperature, water, sunlight availability, etc.). Due to their stationary nature, plants have evolved growth-mediated movements that help them to adapt to changes in their surrounding environment. These directed growth movements (termed tropisms) help ensure the fitness and survival of the plant. For instance, plants generally direct root growth down into the soil (gravitropism) to help anchor the plant and absorb water (hydrotropism) and nutrients while directing shoot growth upward toward a source of light (phototropism; Molas and Kiss, 2009 and heliotropism; Vandenbrink et al., 2014). In addition, climbing plants such as vines send out tendrils that come into contact with an object and proceed to grow themselves around the object for support (thigmotropism). The ability of plants to grow in response to environmental stimuli has been documented throughout history. Theophrastus, a disciple of Aristotle, noted the phototropic and heliotropic (modified phototropism) movements of plants. Theophrastus (erroneously) attributed the bending of a plant toward the sun as a byproduct of the sun’s rays removing liquid from the illuminated side of the plant (Theophrastus, 1976). The theory of water loss as the cause of phototropic growth was further championed by Bacon and Sylvarum (1627). In addition, poems dating back to ancient Rome detail observations of plants moving in response to the ever-changing position of the sun (Ovid, 2008). However, it was not until the publishing of Charles and Francis Darwin’s “The Power of Movement in Plants” that our current understanding of plant tropistic movements began to take shape (Darwin and Darwin, 1880). Darwin detailed experiments involving “heliotropic” movement (subsequently termed phototropic movement), plant circumnutation, responses to gravity as well as other nastic plant movements. In his experiments, Darwin detailed how plants sense external stimuli such as light and gravity and are able to respond through directional growth-mediated movements. In addition, Darwin outlined that perception of a stimulus and plant growth response do not necessarily happen in the same organ of the plant. Additionally, Darwin observed that the phototropic response was most distinct when the plant was illuminated with blue light, suggesting specificity in sensing the light source. His work also hypothesized the existence of a factor that moves from the site of stimulus perception to the sight of growth response, an idea that contributed to the discovery of the plant hormone auxin decades later. Similar to phototropism, gravitropism has a long history of inquiry. One of the first characterizations of plant gravitropic response was detailed by Knight (1806). However, as noted in his paper, observations of gravitropic response long pre-dated his inquiry. To better understand the gravitropism in plants, Knight altered the perceived gravity vector by germinating garden beans on a wheel rotating perpendicular to the earth’s gravity vector. The beans germinating on the wheel responded to the new gravity vector by directing the growth of roots to the center of the wheel, and shoots toward its periphery, suggesting that gravity was responsible for plant orientation. In addition to Knight’s initial work, “The Power of Movement in Plants” was also seminal in the understanding of gravitropic movements. Darwin demonstrated that the tip of the root (root cap) was responsible for sensing the gravity vector through various dissection experiments. This observation led to the elucidation that once a new gravity vector was sensed, the root tip would produce a signal to promote differential cell growth on the two opposing sides of the root. Darwin originally characterized the connection between gravitropism and phototropism in “The Power of Movement in Plants.” Since that time, efforts have been made to understand the relationship between the two processes, as well as trying to untangle the two to understand each in its own right. Since the initial characterization of phototropic and gravitropic movement, many of the underlying mechanisms of perception, transduction and response have been uncovered, yet little is known about the interplay between the two processes. Initially, studying the phototropic response alone was impossible as there was no way to remove the gravity vector on a terrestrial platform. Attempts to simulate the effects of reduced gravity via perpetual rotation on a clinostat or via free fall machines provide a proxy for microgravity by reducing the plant’s ability to perceive the gravity vector, but the gravity vector is never truly removed (Herranz et al., 2013a). In addition, these methods often have the unintended consequence of additional stresses being imparted on the sample. However, the advent of space research has allowed for the first true uncoupling of phototropic and gravitropic growth responses (Ferl et al., 2002; Wolverton and Kiss, 2009).GRAVITROPISM While gravity is a constant vector that acts equally across all parts of an organism, higher plants contain specialized cells (termed statocytes) responsible for sensing gravity (Kiss, 2000; Saito et al., 2005). In flowering plants, the gravitropic response mechanism is localized primarily in two tissue types. In roots, specialized gravity sensing cells reside in the columella of the root cap (Figure 1), whereas evidence shows that plant shoots sense gravity via endodermal cells (Figure 2) – a single layer of cells between the vascular tissue and cortex (Fukaki et al., 1998; MacCleery and Kiss, 1999). These two specialized tissues are responsible for sensing the direction of the gravity vector and relaying the information to other areas of the plant for a response, such as differential growth along a zone of elongation (Sack, 1991). Generally light (phototropism) has an overriding effect on the gravitropic response of shoot tissue, however many studies have shown interplay between the two phenomena (Molas and Kiss, 2009). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Root tissue sensing and response to gravistimulation by reorientation. (A) The statoliths of gravity-perceiving columella cells settle to the bottom of the cells relative to gravity, which results in a symmetrical distribution of auxin through all sides of the root cap and equal growth in the root elongation zone (apical of the root cap, not pictured). (B) Upon gravistimulation by reorientation, the statoliths settle at a new position toward the gravity vector. The new position is perceived by the cell, whereby a cascade of signals leads to an unequal distribution of auxin to the side of the root nearest the new gravity vector. This unequal distribution of auxin reduces cell growth where concentrations are high, resulting in growth-mediated bending of the root in the direction of the new gravity vector.FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Stem tissue sensing and response to gravistimulation by reorientation. In stems, the gravity perceiving cells are located within the endodermis. Upon stimulation from a new gravity vector, the statoliths settle to the lateral side of the cell nearest the gravity vector. The new position of the statoliths leads to a differential increase in auxin concentration in the lateral tissue, and differential growth thereby occurs on the two opposite sides of the stem. This differential growth results in a bending of the stem away from the direction of the gravity vector.MECHANISM: SENSING OF GRAVITY AT THE ROOT AND SHOOT APICES The starch-statolith hypothesis proposes that perception is mediated by the interaction of dense starch-filled organelles (termed statoliths) with other cytoplasmic structures in order to provide directional information to the plant (Kiss, 2000; Saito et al., 2005). A change in the position of the plant leads to a change in the potential energy of the amyloplasts, the statoliths in flowering plants. This energy is then transferred to the plasma membrane as the statoliths settle at a new position in the direction of the new gravity vector. This new position can then be relayed to the rest of the plant via the plant hormone auxin (Simmons et al., 1995; Firn et al., 2000) and then a gravitropic response can be initiated. Roots most often display positive gravitropism, growing in the direction of the gravity vector and thus into the soil (Figure 1). When measuring the gravitropic response of roots of Arabidopsis starchless mutants, it was observed that the time of response was severely reduced and delayed compared to the response in wild-type genotypes. A similar response was observed in roots and hypocotyls of Nicotiana reduced starch mutants (Kiss and Sack, 1989, 1990). The gravitropic response of roots has also been shown to be linked to the actual rate at which amyloplast sedimentation occurs in Arabidopsis (MacCleery and Kiss, 1999). Furthermore, the gravitropic response has also been correlated to the total mass of statoliths in the root columella cells (Kiss et al., 1996, 1997). In contrast to roots, stems and stem-like organs exhibit negative gravitropism, growing upward and away from the gravity vector. Mutants lacking amyloplasts in the endodermal cell layer lack gravitropic responses (Fujihira et al., 2000). In addition, stems of starch-deficient Arabidopsis correlated the total mass of starch in endodermal tissue to a change in the response to gravity (Kiss et al., 1997). In addition, gravity perception plays a role in plant development. Stem-like organs often maintain specific angles in relation to gravity, known as a gravitropic setpoint angle (GSA; Digby and Firn, 1995). The GSA operates through the existence of an antigravitropic offset mechanism that works in tension with gravitropism. The magnitude of the antigravitropic offset in relation to gravitropism determines the magnitude of the lateral stem’s angle. GSA values are modulated via the plant hormone auxin in the gravity sensing cells of root and shoot tissue, further implicating the role of auxin in tropism and plant architecture (Roychoudhry et al., 2013). Further support for the starch-statolith hypotheses is provided by studies which reported that plants lacking starch in the stem endodermal amyloplasts also have a severely reduced gravitropic response (Weise and Kiss, 1999). This suggests that in stem the gravitropic response is similarly regulated by starch-filled amyloplasts. In addition, amyloplasts lacking a full complement of starch show reduced ability to perceive gravity in Arabidopsis (Kiss et al., 1996, 1997, 1998a,b). However, starch-deficient mutants lacking a full complement but grown in hypergravity environments (2–10 × g) restored the gravitropic response (Fitzelle and Kiss, 2001). An alternative model to statolith-based gravity sensing is the protoplast-pressure hypothesis, where the total mass of the cytoplasm causes tension on the top and bottom of the plasma membrane (relative to the gravity vector; Wayne et al., 1990; Wayne and Staves, 1996). This model is largely based on studies of Characean algae Nitellopsis and Chara, both of which do not contain starch-filled amyloplasts yet still respond to gravity stimulus by exhibiting a gravity-dependent cytoplasmic streaming (Wayne et al., 1992; Staves, 1997). In addition, support for the protoplast-pressure hypothesis arises from the fact that starchless mutants of Arabidopsis, while greatly reduced, can still sense and respond to gravity (Kiss et al., 1989). Furthermore, proponents of the protoplast-pressure hypothesis point out that studies using starch mutants (key evidence in support of the starch-statolith hypothesis) do not discriminate effectively between the two competing hypothesis (Staves et al., 1997a). A study of gravitropism in the roots of rice (Oryza sativa, Poaceae) used variable densities of an external media to exert more or less force on root tissue without changing statolith sedimentation rate, resulting in changes in gravitropic response (Staves et al., 1997b). While some debate still exists between the validity of the two models, it is likely a combination of multiple gravity sensing mechanisms that control gravitropism. It has been proposed that similar to the way in which a plant senses light, where multiple photosensory mechanisms exist, plants may contain multiple mechanisms which help to perceive the gravity vector (Sack, 1997). In addition, Perbal (1999) proposed that statoliths and the protoplast both can act in gravity sensing, with statoliths being the more sensitive mechanism. A commentary suggests that throughout evolution, higher plants have acquired multiple gravisensing mechanisms as evolution is unlikely to select against a process that aids in fitness (Barlow, 1995). Additionally, Barlow (1995) supposes that gravity sensory redundancy allows gravity to play a larger role in plant development through the evolution of distinct signaling pathways.TRANSDUCTION OF THE GRAVITY SIGNAL AND THE RESPONSE PHASE Upon sensing of the gravity stimulus, the cell needs to convey the message to the elongation zone before differential growth leading to curvature can occur. In the case of stem tissue, the elongation region is nearby, requiring lateral transmission of the signal to this tissue (Figure 2). However, in the case of roots, the signal must be conveyed over a relatively longer distance to the root elongation zone (Figure 1). While various signal transduction mechanisms have been proposed, there is a great deal of evidence that supports the role of the plant cytoskeleton being involved in gravity transduction. It has been suggested that microtubules may be involved in the perception of gravity in coleoptiles (Blancaflor, 2002). In addition, depolymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton results in promotion of gravitropic curvature in stems and roots, suggesting that the actin cytoskeleton may play a role in regulation of the gravitropic response (Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Hou et al., 2003). While a role for the cytoskeleton in gravitropic response seems evident, little is known about the mechanism that associates the cytoskeleton with amyloplasts. The actin-tether model proposes that amyloplasts are physically associated with the cytoskeleton, and reorientation in respect to the gravity vector causes the amyloplasts to exert tension or slack on the cytoskeleton (Baluška and Hasenstein, 1997). This change in tension is then relayed to the plasma membrane, where the signal can then be transduced. A second hypothesis, the tensegrity model, proposes that amyloplasts are not attached to the cytoskeleton. Instead, as the amyloplasts reorient to a new gravity vector, they come into contact and disrupt the actin microfilament network. The signal is then transduced to the plasma membrane, where Ca2+ stores within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are released (Yoder et al., 2001). As stated previously, the new relative position of the amyloplast (serving a statolith) is perceived by the cell. One observation is the statocyte responds to gravistimulation by increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and reducing the cytosolic proton concentration, which leads to auxin being differential distributed in the direction of the gravity vector (Tasaka et al., 1999; Morita and Tasaka, 2004). The resulting differential distribution of auxin results in unilateral inhibition of root growth on one side, causing the root to grow in a new downward orientation toward the gravity vector. It has been proposed that the ER acts as a Ca2+ reservoir; once statoliths settle in the direction of the gravity vector and contact the ER, stored Ca2+ is released into the cell (Perbal and Driss-Ecole, 2003). A study using high-resolution electron tomography adds support to this hypothesis, finding statolith sedimentation on the ER was sufficient in locally deforming the ER membrane, and in turn had the potential to activate local mechanosensitive ion channels (Leitz et al., 2009). The authors of this study further suggest that transmission of the gravisensory signal results from a combination of kinetic energy being transferred to the ER from the statolith, rapid release of kinetic energy from the ER upon initial reorientation of the columella cell, as well as statolith-driven motion of the cell cytosol. Furthermore, it is possible that calcium release acts as a signaling molecule during gravistimulation. A recent study indicates that an enzyme in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase) requires Ca2+ to elicit a gravitropic response, suggesting Ca2+ may be a signaling element for downstream growth regulation (Huang et al., 2013). Perception of gravity by the root cap has been shown to result in asymmetrical auxin distribution across the root, leading to differential growth in the root elongation zone (Ottenschläger et al., 2003). A mathematical model inferring auxin distribution suggests a rapid (within 5 min) twofold increase in the auxin content on the lower side of the root, which leads to inhibition of growth and bending of the stem (Band et al., 2012). However, the mechanism and genes involved in the formation for the auxin gradient still remains unclear. Various genes (e.g., PIN, ABCB, and AUX/LAX families) have been implicated in the transport of auxin from the root cap to the distal elongation zone, yet a defined mechanism remains elusive (Luschnig et al., 1998; Petrášek and Friml, 2009). In addition to the identification of genes involved in auxin transport, regulators of the proposed transport genes such as the PIN regulator GOLVEN (GLV), which encode for small secretory peptides, have been shown to regulate the distribution of PIN2 and therefore the formation of the auxin gradient responsible for differential growth in gravitropism (Whitford et al., 2012). A potentially important facilitator of auxin transport is AtPIN3. PIN3 has been implicated in both hypocotyl and root tropisms. In the hypocotyl, PIN3 is expressed in the shoot endodermis, suggesting it may mediate the lateral distribution of auxin (Friml et al., 2002). In the columella cells of the root, PIN3 localizes along the plasma membrane symmetrically, but quickly (within ∼2 min) relocalizes to the bottom plasma membrane upon gravistimulation by reorientation. This relocalization of PIN3 coincides well with the redistribution of auxin along the root cap and endodermal cells to the elongation zone. This results in auxin inhibiting the growth of cells in the elongation zone nearest the gravity vector, causing the stem to grow downward toward the new gravity vector. Evidence shows that auxin efflux complexes such as PIN proteins cycle along the actin cytoskeleton between the plasma membrane and endosome (Geldner et al., 2001). These results are in accordance with models that suggest that the actin cytoskeleton reorganizes in concert with statolith sedimentation (Baluška and Hasenstein, 1997; Yoder et al., 2001). This reorganization would help to facilitate PIN3 relocalization to the new perceived bottom of the cell. A recent study has shown that the regulation of PIN2 on opposing sides of gravistimulated root tissue is controlled by an auxin feedback mechanism (Baster et al., 2013). Auxin was shown to control the plasma membrane PIN abundance though vacuolar targeting and degradation through a specialized auxin receptor. This observation indicates that auxin plays a role in recycling the PIN proteins to the plasma membrane or to send them to the vacuole for degradation. Interestingly, the same study indicated that auxin leads to degradation of PIN in the presence of low auxin content as well. These results suggest that during a gravitropic response, auxin leads to the degradation of the PIN proteins coinciding with the different auxin gradients present during a gravitropic response. Additionally, a study by Löfke et al. (2013) has proposed that another plant hormone, gibberellic acid (GA), plays a key role in the trafficking of PIN proteins. Results showed that high GA promoted trafficking of PIN back to the plasma membrane, while low GA concentrations resulted in trafficking to the vacuole for degradation (Löfke et al., 2013). Taken together, these studies suggest that trafficking of PIN proteins is important in regulating auxin flow and initiating the differential growth response. It is likely that AUXIN RESISTANT1 (AUX1) is responsible for the uptake of auxin in the gravity sensing tissue (endodermis and columella of the root cap), while PIN2 facilitates the transport from the root cap to the elongation zone (Friml, 2003). Genetic expression analysis of AUX1 suggests that AUX1 is required for root gravitropic response and is associated with basipetal auxin transport from the root cap to the elongation zone (Swarup et al., 2001). Recently, it has been proposed that AUX1/LAX genes are responsible for tissue specificity of high auxin levels, while PIN proteins are responsible for directing the flow of auxin from the root cap (Band et al., 2014). This evidence suggests that PIN and AUX/LAX proteins are key components of the signal transduction pathway from the columella cells to the elongation zone (Swarup et al., 2005). However, to date, many aspects of signal transduction between statocytes and the growth response remain unclear. While sensing of the gravity vector is similar in both roots and shoots, it is possible that the mode of signal transduction is different. In roots, gravity perception takes place in the columella cells, and transferred to the elongation zone which is proximal to the columella cells (Kiss, 2000). Differential auxin concentrations between the two sides of the root cap have been correlated with bending of root tissue (Luschnig et al., 1998). In addition, while there is spatial separation of perception and response in roots, in shoots, perception and response occur in the same area (Molas and Kiss, 2009). It also has been suggested that perception of gravity occurs in the root columella cells and is transferred distantly to the shoot tissue, suggesting a larger role for root graviperception (Hopkins and Kiss, 2012). Recent studies have also implicated plastid membrane proteins playing a key role in gravitropism. A mutation in Arabidopsis termed ARG1 (altered response to gravity) results in altered root and hypocotyl gravitropism without negative effects on other processes such as phototropism, root growth or starch accumulation (Sedbrook et al., 1999). The ARG1 gene encodes a DnaJ-like domain similar to cytoskeleton-interacting proteins. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that ARG1 is a membrane protein that potentially co-localizes with the PIN proteins (Boonsirichai et al., 2003). Furthermore, this study demonstrated that targeting of ARG1 to the endodermis or columella cells was sufficient in rescuing the phenotype in gravitropism-deficient mutants. ARG1 and its paralog ARL2 (ARG1-LIKE2) have been shown to associated in-complex with actin (Harrison and Masson, 2008a). Additionally, these two proteins are required for the asymmetrical distribution of auxin during gravitropic stimulation (Harrison and Masson, 2008b). ARG1 mutants have also shown to exhibit reduced plastid sedimentation, suggesting a role in both perception and signaling arising from gravitropic stimulation (Kumar et al., 2008). A study by Strohm et al. (2014) has shown that mutants of the Translocon at the Outer membrane of Chloroplast complex (TOC) show decreased gravitropic response in arg1 mutants of Arabidopsis. This complex is responsible for the transport of nuclear-encoded proteins into plastids, however, the identity of which proteins need to be imported for a gravitropic response remains unclear. The study indicated that plastids not only play a role in gravity perception but also play a role in signal transduction. Another Arabidopsis mutant, eal1 (endodermal-amyloplast less 1), completely lacks gravitropic movement in stems, while gravitropic response in roots remains unaffected (Fujihira et al., 2000). Map based cloning techniques have identified eal1 as an allele of the transcription factor SHORT-ROOT (SHR; Morita et al., 2007). Another group of compounds that have been implicated in gravitropic response is jasmonic acid (JA). JA increases significantly during gravitropic stimulation (Gutjahr et al., 2005). Not surprisingly JA has been shown to have multiple interactions with auxin (Riemann et al., 2003, and reviewed by Hofmann and Pollmann, 2008 and Wasternack and Hause, 2013). In rice coleoptiles, jasmonates have been shown to be present in a gradient opposite the auxin gradient during gravitropic stimulation (Gutjahr et al., 2005). In addition, lipozygenase, a key enzyme in JA-biosynthesis, has been shown to be up-regulated during gravitropic stimulation (León and Sánchez-Serrano, 1999). JA was induced by light as well as involved in photostimulation, where a rice mutant lacking JA biosynthesis (hebiba) exhibits delayed photodestruction of phytochrome A (Riemann et al., 2009). Furthermore, a study using hebiba identified the gene GDSL CONTAINING ENZME RICE 1 (GER1) as playing a role in gravitropic response, as it mirrors the level of JA in gravity stimulated coleoptiles (Riemann et al., 2007). The reduction in phytochrome A photodestruction results in an elevated growth response to red and far-red light. Jasmonates have also been implicated in growth-mediated response to touch (thigmotropism) in root tissue, suggesting a role for these compounds in multiple growth responses in plants (Falkenstein et al., 1991; Weiler et al., 1993; Stelmach et al., 1998; Blechert et al., 1999).PHOTOTROPISM A large part of plant growth and orientation is directed through the tropisms. Initially when a seed is buried in soil, the seed relies on the gravitropism to direct its growth in the absence of light. Once the seedling emerges from the soil, phototropic processes can further direct the growth of the seedling. The phototropic response is most often observed in aerial tissues; however, phototropic responses do also occur in roots. Phototropism, which has been shown to be largely stimulated by blue light (Johnston, 1934; Kimura and Kagawa, 2006), further helps the plant to attain efficient growth through increased light capture. In response to blue light, plant shoots generally exhibit positive phototropic response while plant roots exhibit negative phototropic response (Sakai et al., 2000; Correll and Kiss, 2002). The phototropic response evolved early in plant evolution, being present in mosses and ferns in addition to angiosperms (Suetsugu and Wada, 2007). While mosses and ferns exhibit phototropic response to red light, phototropic growth in flowering plants is primarily a response to blue light. SENSING OF THE LIGHT SIGNAL In flowering plants, phototropins are specialized photoreceptor proteins typically located on the plasma membrane that sense blue light and mediate a phototropic response (Sakamoto and Briggs, 2002). In addition to the blue light response, PHOT1 (Huala et al., 1997) and PHOT2 (Jarillo et al., 2001; Sakai et al., 2001) regulate stomatal opening, leaf expansion, and inhibition of stem growth among other processes (Christie, 2007). In the regulation of phototropism, PHOT1 is the primary photoreceptor, whereas PHOT2 only enacts a response when exposed to high intensities of radiation fluence (Sakai et al., 2001). While PHOT2 plays a small role in phototropic mediated signaling, this protein has significant roles in other light responses such as chloroplast movements (Wada et al., 2003) as well as stomatal regulation (Kinoshita et al., 2001). Upon low light conditions, PHOT2 stimulation causes relocation of chloroplasts perpendicular to incident irradiation, while high blue-light stimulation of PHOT2 leads to mobilization of chloroplasts away from the edge of the cell to avoid photobleaching of the organelles (Sakai et al., 2001). Upon blue-light excitation, PHOT1 and PHOT2 release from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm (Sakamoto and Briggs, 2002; Wan et al., 2008), while PHOT2 becomes associated with the Golgi apparatus (Sakamoto and Briggs, 2002; Kong et al., 2006). Following excitation with blue light, autophosphorylation of PHOT1 and PHOT2 leads to phototropin-mediated signaling (Inoue et al., 2008, 2011). Upon relocalization, PHOT1 has been shown to associate with clathrin, and is presumed to be internalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Kaiserli et al., 2009). These studies indicate that phosphorylation and subsequent internalization of the PHOT1 is required for phototropic response, however the specific role PHOT1 and PHOT2 play in signal transduction remains unclear. Curiously, activation of phytochrome A, which is stimulated by red/far red light, prevents internalization of PHOT1 and leads to an increased phototropic response (Han et al., 2008). In addition to the phototropins, there are multiple phototropin-interacting proteins shown to be involved in phototropism. Like the phototropins, NONPHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL3 (NPH3) has been shown to localize to the plasma membrane and to physically interact with PHOT1 (Motchoulski and Liscum, 1999). In addition, NPH3 is required for phototropic response under both low and high intensity stimulation with blue light (Motchoulski and Liscum, 1999; Roberts et al., 2011). However, unlike the phototropins, NPH3 remains membrane associated throughout light stimulation and the phototropic response. It appears that NPH3 plays a role as a substrate in ubiquitination of PHOT1 under both low and high blue-light conditions (Roberts et al., 2011). Under high-blue-light conditions, when the plant is receiving sufficient light for photosynthetic processes, PHOT1 is poly-ubiquitinated and degraded. However, under low blue-light conditions, PHOT1 was shown to be only mono-ubiquitinated, a necessity for initiation of phototropic response (Roberts et al., 2011). Another protein found to be involved in phototropism is ROOT PHOTOTROPISM2 (RPT2). RPT2 has been implicated in the phototropic response under high blue light conditions, where mutations in the gene result in defective hypocotyl phototropic response (Sakai et al., 2000). This is due in fact to RPT2 being transcriptionally regulated by both blue light and red light in a high-fluency-dependent manner (Sakai et al., 2000). Like the previously mentioned proteins, RTP2 also localizes to the plasma membrane of the cell, where it interacts with both PHOT1 and NPH3 (Inada et al., 2004) It is yet unknown whether or not RTP2 interacts with Cullin-3 (CUL3), however, Hohm et al. (2013) have suggested that both NPH3 and RTP2 could be required for ubiquitination under high blue-light condition.TRANSDUCTION OF THE LIGHT SIGNAL AND THE RESPONSE PHASE Upon sensing a light signal, transduction of that signal must take place to induce growth in the elongation zones. The classical Cholodny–Went hypothesis proposes that the differential growth exhibited by a plant when illuminated with unidirectional light is a result of differential concentrations of auxin on the illuminated and shaded sides of the plant (Went and Thimann, 1937). The difference in auxin content results in cessation of cell growth on the illuminated side of the plant, while growth continues in the shaded side, resulting in tropistic movement in the direction of the light. A later study found that introduction of a physical barrier between illuminated and shaded sides of maize coleoptiles prevents the formation of an auxin gradient (Briggs, 1963). Using labeled auxin, Pickard and Thimann (1964) found that auxin moves laterally across the coleoptile when illuminated with continuous light, as well as low light dosages. This results in differential growth on the illuminated and shaded sides of the plant. The differential concentrations in auxin needed to spur differential growth and phototropic response are thought to be the result of local and long-range adaptations in auxin transport (Christie and Murphy, 2013; Hohm et al., 2013). With the advancement of genetic and molecular techniques, it is possible to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for phototropic growth. Not surprisingly, similarities between phototropic stimulated signal transduction and gravitropic stimulated signal transduction have been identified. Like gravitropic response, PIN proteins play a significant role in auxin efflux during phototropic response. Five PIN family proteins (PIN1, PIN2, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7) reside within the plasma membrane and appear to facilitate auxin efflux during phototropism, with PIN1 and PIN2 functioning as the main efflux carriers (Christie and Murphy, 2013). However, mutant screens of the PIN proteins suggest that all five contribute to phototropic response under differing conditions (Christie et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2011; Haga and Sakai, 2012). These proteins likely play an important role in formation of the lateral auxin gradient, however, it is likely that other auxin transporters exist to help facilitate in creation of the gradient (Christie et al., 2011). Another family of proteins, ATP BINDING CASSETE B (ABCB) has been implicated in mediating phototropic response in Arabidopsis. Specifically, ABCB19 mutants have been shown to exhibit increased phototropic response (Noh et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 2011). It has been suggested that ABCB19 acts in concert with PIN1 to facilitate lateral transport of auxin through stabilization of PIN1 in the plasma membrane. Loss of function of ABCB19 results in reduced lateral auxin transport arising from the destabilization of PIN1, and the resulting loss of lateral auxin transport reduces the phototropic response. In another similarity to gravitropic response, the AUX1 and LIKE-AUX1 (LAX) family of genes appears to play a role in influx of auxin and the resulting phototropic response. However, at the present time, the specific role of these proteins is unclear at best. Mutations to the AUX1/LAX genes results in very subtle loss of phototropic response when mutated alone (Okada and Shimura, 1992). However, when loss of function is introduced to AUX1 in combination with LAX2 and LAX3, reduced phototropic response in hypocotyl occurs (Christie et al., 2011).INTERACTION OF LIGHT AND GRAVITY: INSIGHTS OBTAINED FROM SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIMENTS As evidenced by the commonalities between gravitropic and phototropic response, it is difficult to untangle the two processes without escaping the constant gravity vector present during terrestrial experiments. Once a phototropic response occurs in the plant, and differential growth occurs in response to the unidirectional light, a gravitropic response is initiated in reaction to the new perceived direction of the gravity vector (Okada and Shimura, 1992; Mullen et al., 2000). Special techniques such as rotation on a clinostat or free fall machines have been used in an attempt to simulate the effects of microgravity through constantly changing the gravity vector (Herranz et al., 2013a; Kiss, 2014). For instance, Zea mays grown on a rotating clinostat had reduced perceived gravity, which led to an increase in phototropic response (Nick and Schäfer, 1988). An alternative method to measure phototropic response is to use plants who lack the ability to sense the gravity vector. Multiple experiments conducted on mutant Arabidopsis plants lacking starch or amyloplasts displayed a greater magnitude of phototropic curvature (Vitha et al., 2000; Ruppel et al., 2001). It was not until the advent of spaceflight that the effects of the gravity vector could be reduced and the decoupling of phototropism and gravitropism could be studied. Plants grown on the Space Shuttle or the International Space Station (ISS) provide the opportunity to observe phototropic response in conditions of microgravity. For instance, it has been revealed that in conditions of microgravity, amyloplasts do not distribute randomly throughout the statocyte, suggesting there is a connection between the amyloplasts and the cytoskeleton (Perbal et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1997; Driss-Ecole et al., 2000). Experiments performed in low earth orbit aboard a Space Shuttle have been utilized to provide support for the starch-statolith hypothesis for gravity perception (Kiss et al., 1998b, 1999). Wild-type and starchless mutants grown in a microgravity environment, as well as in a centrifuge present aboard the shuttle that simulated 1g conditions, revealed that increased starch content increases the magnitude of gravitropic response. Studies on the ISS have been utilized to characterize a novel positive phototropic response to red light in Arabidopsis hypocotyls (Millar et al., 2010, Kiss et al., 2012). A similar phototropic response has previously been discovered in Arabidopsis roots by using specialized instrumentation on Earth (Kiss et al., 2003), however, conditions of microgravity revealed a much more robust response. These results suggest that flowering plants such as Arabidopsis have retained a red light phototropic response that is present in more ancient plant lineages such as ferns and mosses. However, it was also revealed that small fractional conditions (0.1–0.3 g) were enough to alternate the red-light phototropic response (Kiss et al., 2012). Interestingly, the phototropic response to blue-light stimulation also exhibits an exaggerated response in microgravity conditions (Millar et al., 2010). In addition to signal perception, it is possible that microgravity environments affect the signal transduction of gravitropism as well. Evidence suggests that signaling via Ca2+ is hampered by microgravity environments (Ferl et al., 2002). Expression patterns of an alcohol dehydrogenase::β-glucuronidase (Adh::GUS) transgene could only be replicated when treated with Ca2+ inhibitors (Paul et al., 2001). It also has been found that other processes that utilize Ca2+ such as cell wall architecture, specifically lignin biosynthesis, is hampered during spaceflight (Cowles et al., 1994; Sato et al., 1999). Taken together, these studies suggest that signal transduction as well as perception are affected by conditions of microgravity. While the microgravity conditions obtained during spaceflight offer a unique environment for understanding the interplay between gravitropism and phototropism, it also provides the ability to study plant growth and development in fractional or reduced gravity environments (Kiss, 2014). Gravity environments similar to those experienced on the moon or Mars can provide insight into the future plant growth that is required for long-range spaceflight and/or colonization of other celestial bodies. Continued experiments aboard the ISS (Kiss et al., 2014) will allow for a better understanding of the relationships between gravitropism and phototropism which will be experienced by plants grown by future colonization of other planets.GRAVITY AND LIGHT EFFECTS ON MERISTEMATIC CELL FUNCTIONS CELL PROLIFERATION AND GROWTH IN THE ROOT MERISTEM INFLUENCE PLANT DEVELOPMENT All adult plants contain meristematic tissues, composed by populations of undifferentiated, totipotent cells with a high capacity of cell proliferation and cell growth. Any specialized tissue can be formed from meristems at any time in the life of the plant. Indeed, plant growth and development, which rely on cellular functions, greatly depend on the balance between cell proliferation and cell differentiation that exists in meristems, which is controlled, in turn, by hormones, among them auxin playing a central role (Perrot-Rechenmann, 2010). Regulators of plant growth and differentiation (i.e., differentiation and developmental signals) are capable of activating key modulators of cell growth and cell division in a coordinated manner in meristems. Therefore, cell growth and cell proliferation are closely interconnected to one another and this coordination is called “meristematic competence” (Mizukami, 2001). The concept of cell proliferation is intimately linked to the existence of the cell division cycle, or simply the cell cycle. Proliferating cells grow, duplicate DNA and divide in a cyclic manner. The process is strictly regulated at two specific checkpoints, the first of them at the transition G1/S, allowing DNA replication to proceed, and the second at the transition G2/M, in which the ability of cells to divide is checked. Specific proteins called cyclins, and specific cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play essential roles in these regulatory processes (De Veylder et al., 2003). The concept of cell growth mostly affects the production of cell biomass, essentially proteins, so it is largely determined by the activity of RNA polymerase I, which controls ribosomal RNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis (Baserga, 2007). It has been largely established, in particular for plants, that the rate of ribosome biogenesis can be estimated through certain features of the molecular cytology of the nucleolus (Medina et al., 2000; Shaw and Doonan, 2005; Sáez-Vásquez and Medina, 2008). Furthermore, regulation of ribosome production is controlled by a subset of nucleolar proteins, among which nucleolin is, a protein conserved in animals, plants and yeast, whose levels are correlated with the rate of functional activity of the nucleolus (Ginisty et al., 1999; González-Camacho and Medina, 2006; Pontvianne et al., 2007). In this context, it is widely known that environmental conditions modulate meristematic activities, directly or indirectly, at different levels of regulation (Komaki and Sugimoto, 2012). Since many factors involved in light and gravity sensing are also acting in regulating cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis, it is interesting to review how these fundamental environmental factors affect plant development by affecting the regulation of these cellular processes.EFFECTS OF ALTERED GRAVITY ON CELL PROLIFERATION AND GROWTH The influence of gravity on meristematic cell functions has been approached up to now in a relatively small number of experiments performed in space and in ground-based devices of simulated microgravity (Herranz et al., 2013a). In early pioneering studies on plant space biology it was reported an increase of mitotic index of lentil roots grown was found in microgravity (Darbelley et al., 1986). The interpretation was not unequivocal, since this effect could be due either to a shortening of the interphase or to a lengthening of mitosis. In a further study on board of Spacelab (IML-1 Mission), also using lentil seedlings, a lower mitotic index was shown in root cortical cells of samples grown in space, but no apparent perturbations in the mitosis were observed (Driss-Ecole et al., 1994). In the same work, the authors observed that microgravity promoted the arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. All these experiments were performed with a relatively short exposure of plants to microgravity (28–29 h). In lentil seedlings grown for 30 h in microgravity, the progression of cell cycle was modified, even though the cell elongation did not appear affected (Legué et al., 1996; Yu et al., 1999). The densitometric analysis of nuclear DNA content of meristematic cells from roots grown in microgravity showed a decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase correlated with an increased proportion of cells in G1 phase, suggesting that the G1/S transition of the cell cycle is modulated by gravity. The first European experiment on plant biology on board the ISS revealed that one of the most relevant effects of altered gravity is the disruption of the meristematic competence in cells of the root apical meristem (Matía et al., 2005, 2010). Under microgravity conditions, cell proliferation and cell growth appear uncoupled, losing their coordinated progress which is characteristic of these cells under normal ground gravity conditions. Further experiments performed on ground-based facilities for microgravity simulation, including sequential sampling at different growth times and the analysis of gene expression, have confirmed the uncoupling of cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis caused by altered gravity, showing that the weightlessness environment is a stress condition for plant proliferating cells. The effects of the gravitational stress are detected from the very beginning of germination, in 2-day-old seedlings (Matía et al., 2009; Herranz et al., 2013b; Manzano et al., 2013). The enhanced cell proliferation rate is not accompanied by an increase in the levels of cyclin B1, a regulator of the G2/M transition, as would be the normal in ground gravity, but, on the contrary, these levels appear depleted. At the same time, a lower cellular growth was observed, since ribosomes, the cellular factories of proteins, were produced at a lower rate. This depletion of ribosome biogenesis was already observed in meristematic root cells grown in simulated microgravity (Shen-Miller and Hinchman, 1995; Sobol et al., 2005, 2006), but it was not put in relation to other cellular processes. Since cyclin B1 is synthesized in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and also this period is the most active in ribosome production (Sáez-Vásquez and Medina, 2008), a shortening of G2 phase is compatible with the mentioned observed uncoupling. The causes of this shortening could be found in a failure or malfunction of the cell size checkpoint which immediately precedes mitosis (De Schutter et al., 2007; González et al., 2007). Whereas the effects of the lack of detection of a gravity vector on meristematic cells have been clearly identified, we still need to elucidate the factor triggering the cascade of functional events that eventually result in the alteration of meristematic cell proliferation and growth and in the disruption of meristematic competence. According to previously published data, the change in the hormonal signaling pathway mediated by the auxin polar transport could be a possible candidate to play this triggering role (Medina and Herranz, 2010). It has been demonstrated that auxin plays a fundamental role in the connection between stimuli perceived by the plant and the cellular responses to them (Muday and Murphy, 2002). As stated above, mechanical sensing of a gravity change by columella cells is converted into a relocation of PIN proteins, finally resulting in changes in the auxin gradient in the root (Friml et al., 2002; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010). There are experimental results showing that this change in the gradient is associated with the inhibition of the auxin polar transport, at least partially (Hoshino et al., 2007; Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., submitted). Auxin influences multiple aspects of plant growth and development, including the regulation of cell cycle progression and the coordination between cell growth and cell division (David et al., 2007; Jurado et al., 2010; Perrot-Rechenmann, 2010). Therefore, all available data point to auxin as the key mediator between altered gravity sensing and the observed effects on root meristematic cells (Medina and Herranz, 2010; Figure 3). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Schematic view of the factors involved in the response of meristematic cells to the alteration of the environmental gravity sensing in conditions of microgravity and the possible counteracting effect of light irradiation, particularly red light. Under normal gravity conditions, the gravity vector is sensed in statocytes of the root cap (“professional” cells), and the signal is transduced through the regulation of the auxin polar transport in the root. In meristematic cells, auxin regulates meristematic competence through its interaction with a number of growth coordinators appearing in the figure (nucleolin is a regulator of ribosome biogenesis which interacts, in turn, with cell cycle regulators; E2FB is a member of a family of transcription factors, regulated by auxin, which induces cell proliferation and growth; cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are major elements of cell cycle checkpoints controlling DNA replication and entry into mitosis). In addition, other mechanisms of gravity sensing and transduction must exist in “non-professional” cells, i.e., cells not specialized in gravity sensing, and, eventually, promote a similar response in meristematic/proliferating cells, as inferred from the results obtained in biological systems devoid of statocytes and statoliths. These mechanisms are poorly known at present. In microgravity conditions, auxin polar transport is inhibited, at least partially, auxin levels are high at meristems and growth coordinators are, in general, down regulated. The response is the disruption of meristematic competence in proliferating cells. Photoactivation by light (especially by red light), sensed and mediated by phytochromes (especially PHYB), is known to produce down regulation of auxin responsive genes and upregulation of many growth coordinators in meristematic cells, by means of direct and/or indirect mechanisms. These effects may counteract the gravitational stress in root meristematic cells in conditions of microgravity. Red arrows indicate down regulation, black arrows indicate up regulation and blue arrow indicates unknown effect.Since gravity can be considered as an abiotic component of the environment, it would be interesting to consider to what extent the response to gravity alteration follows a similar pattern as the response to other abiotic stresses, or, in the case of gravity, whether plants have developed specific mechanisms of defense and/or adaptation. It is widely known that abiotic stresses, such as thermal shock (heat or cold), drought or saline stress, usually cause arrest of the cell cycle on actively proliferating cells (Sacks et al., 1997; Burssens et al., 2000; West et al., 2004; De Veylder et al., 2007; Doerner, 2008; Komaki and Sugimoto, 2012). In the case of gravitational stress, the cycle is not arrested, but the regulation is severely affected through the failure of the G2/M checkpoint, which allows cells to enter mitosis before a critical size is reached. Apparently this scenario results in an increase of cell proliferation, but the daughter cells resulting from these divisions are abnormal, due to a reduced size. Regarding the long-term consequences of these alterations, it could be foreseen that they could be dramatic for the plant survival, due to a serious impairment of plant development caused by the loss of meristematic competence. However, the reality is that plants finally are capable of surviving in space, even though some features of adult plants are not normal (Miyamoto et al., 1999; Link et al., 2003; Wolverton and Kiss, 2009). This observation suggests that plants would be capable of implementing some countermeasures against the gravitational stress, leading to some sort of adaptation or acclimation to the weightlessness environment, but the molecular processes and mechanisms involved in this presumed adaptation process are unknown at present. Indeed the genomic and transcriptomic data available on the specific cell cycle regulators whose expression is affected by gravity alteration are very scarce and limited to those scarce studies in which the analyzed material was enriched in proliferating cells, such as the root tip (Kimbrough et al., 2004). Therefore, the identification and discrimination of genes and proteins involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle playing a role in the response to gravitational stress is one of the most attractive challenges of space plant biology for the near future (Figure 3). Dedicated transcriptomic/proteomic studies using isolated meristems and/or proliferating in vitro cultured cells will be necessary to find accurate solutions to this problem.GRAVITY SENSING AND TRANSDUCTION IN “NON-PROFESSIONAL” CELLS Whereas the role of auxin appears to be clear in connecting the alterations found in meristematic cells with the gravitropic response, it does not provide an explanation to the alterations found in cellular systems devoid of cells specialized in gravity sensing, such as in vitro cultured cells. A response to mechanical signals by these cells, in which the perception mechanism is unknown, has been reported in both plant and animal cells (Cogoli and Cogoli-Greuter, 1997; Kordyum, 1997; Dai et al., 2007). In plants, an altered gravity environment (including spaceflight) has been shown to induce transcriptomic and proteomic effects of on Arabidopsis callus cell cultures (Martzivanou et al., 2006; Barjaktarovic et al., 2009; Manzano et al., 2012; Paul et al., 2012; Hausmann et al., 2013). These cellular systems do not show any type of gravitropism, and cultured cells are not integrated in any organism possessing specialized mechanisms for gravity sensing. In this sense, cultured cells can be considered as “non-professional” cells (Van Loon, 2007). Regarding the effects of altered gravity on cell growth and proliferation parameters in this kind of cellular system, no specific reports have been published yet, but preliminary results indicate that the alterations are quite similar to those found on meristems (Herranz and Medina, 2014 and unpublished data). Interestingly, whereas functional alterations on undifferentiated cells grown in microgravity were similar either in meristematic cells from seedlings or in cultured cells, transcriptomic changes were substantially different from seedlings or callus cultures (Paul et al., 2012). This suggests a specialized response by different cell types, such that both meristems and cell cultures would share the condition of being homogeneous populations of undifferentiated proliferating cells, whereas each seedling is composed by a heterogeneous collection of differentiated cells, differing in function, structure, and gene expression. An intermediate case between gravitropic seedling roots and in vitro cell cultures is provided by seedling roots exposed to magnetic levitation (Manzano et al., 2013). In this case, root cells are subjected to the levitation force caused by the diamagnetic levitation of water, which counteracts the force due to gravity but it is not capable of inducing any displacement of statoliths. The response at the meristematic cell level is the disruption of meristematic competence associated to an altered polar auxin transport. This means that there should be an intermediate factor, independent of statoliths, capable of linking the signal sensed in the cell and the alteration of the polar auxin transport. Therefore, depending on the type of cell, gravity sensing may or may not involve statolith movement and, consequently it may or may not produce gravitropic effects; furthermore, the transduction of the signal may or may not affect the polar auxin transport. In all cases, both in planta and in vitro, the response of undifferentiated proliferating cells to the perception of the lack of a gravity vector is an alteration in growth and proliferation capable of disrupting meristematic competence. It is conceivable that different mechanisms of gravity sensing and signal transduction (within a cell or throughout cells) involving different molecular and cellular players and mediators may exist in different biological systems and even co-exist in a biological model (plants or cell cultures; real or simulated microgravity; mechanical; or magnetic simulation). The nature and the localization of the mechanosensor in “non-professional” cells was hypothesized to be related to the membrane-cytoskeleton associations (Van Loon, 2007). There is a process, called gravity resistance, which is the capacity of plants to resist the gravity force by developing rigid structures, whose cellular basis is the existence of mechanosensitive ion channels at the plasma membrane and the reorientation of cortical microtubules (Hoson et al., 2005, 2010). This mechanism of gravity sensing is compatible with the available data on graviresponse in “non-professional” cells and may represent an initial explanation, which does not exclude the need of dedicated investigation (Figure 3). Furthermore, it has been proposed that cells outside the cap root area are capable of producing a partial gravitropic response in maize (Wolverton et al., 2002; Mancuso et al., 2006). An alternative (or complementary) mechanism of gravity sensing, not directly related to columella cells, is the protoplast-pressure hypothesis, already mentioned and discussed in a preceding section of this paper.INFLUENCE OF LIGHT STIMULATION ON MERISTEMATIC CELL FUNCTIONS Light signaling and plant development From the different environmental factors which influence the life of plants on Earth, light via photosynthesis is ultimately the sole energy source for plant growth. Therefore, linking growth control to light signaling, at least during the most crucial developmental events, is essential for the most efficient use of energy and in order to guarantee success in plant growth and development. Consequently, light regulates many physiological processes related to plant development, starting by the earliest of them, namely seed germination and seedling morphogenesis (photomorphogenesis). This means that light plays specific roles in the activation and regulation of the cellular and molecular functions constituting the basis of these physiological processes, e.g., cell proliferation and cell growth. Multiple parameters of the ambient light signal can be sensed by plants, such as light quantity (fluence), quality (wavelength), direction, and duration. The particular effect of the light direction and wavelength on establishing and modulating the growth direction of the plant and of the plant organs is the fundament of phototropism, which has been thoroughly analyzed in a previous section of this paper, in the presence and in the absence ofgravity. It has been demonstrated that a significant portion of the genome shows differential expression between seedlings that are exposed to light and those that grow in darkness (Ma et al., 2001). The consequence is that many biochemical pathways, located throughout various subcellular organelles, in different cell types, are coordinately regulated by light. Thus, light ultimately controls the key mechanisms driving plant development, such as seed germination and seedling photomorphogenesis (Jiao et al., 2007). Seedling development is indeed quite different depending on whether it proceeds in the presence or in the absence of light. Seedling development in the dark is called skotomorphogenesis, or etiolation, whereas development under light is called photomorphogenesis, or de-etiolation. The morphology of etiolated and light-grown seedlings shows marked differences affecting the length of hypocotyls (shorter under photomorphogenesis), the size and morphology of cotyledons (smaller and closed under etiolation, with apical hooks) and the type of plastids and the presence of chlorophyll in them (chloroplasts versus etioplasts). Furthermore, different metabolic pathways and cellular mechanisms show variable sensitivity to light signals of distinct qualities (Ma et al., 2001; Molas and Kiss, 2009). Phytochromes (PHY) constitute a family of proteins whose different members mediate the developmental responses to the different qualities of light, by exhibiting differential photosensory capabilities. In flowering plants, the PHY gene family consists of five members (PHYA-E; Molas and Kiss, 2009). From them, PHYA is the receptor of monochromatic far-red light, whereas responsiveness to monochromatic red light is predominantly attributed to PHYB (Tepperman et al., 2004). Phytochromes are regulators of changes in gene expression induced in response to light sensing. The regulatory mechanism involves the activation of transcriptional networks, including a collection of transcription factors. Some of these transcription factors are regulated by just one type of light (wavelength), whereas many more respond to a wide spectrum of light (Jiao et al., 2007). A well-characterized, light-responsive element (LRE) is G-Box (Weisshaar et al., 1991; Hornitschek et al., 2012). The affinity of different factors for binding G-Box is modulated by post-translational mechanisms such as phosphorylation. The cases of G-BOX BINDING FACTOR 1 (GBF1) and COMMON PLANT REGULATORY FACTOR 2 (CPRF2) are representative of this mechanism. Both factors are phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CK2) to enable G-Box binding and promote the expression of photomorphogenesis genes in response to red light irradiation. In the case of CPRF2 phosphorylation, red light induces first its translocation to the nucleus, where it is then phosphorylated and bound to G-Box for promoting gene expression (Wellmer et al., 1999). Other key elements driving the transcriptional change induced by light sensing are the members of a subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) phytochrome-interacting transcription factors, which have been designated PIFs (phytochrome interacting factors). PIFs selectively interact with the Pfr form of phytochromes, i.e., the photoactivated form already translocated to the cell nucleus. Different PIFs specifically interact with different phytochromes, and they define direct links between photoreceptors and transcriptional regulation. The analysis of several mutants of PIFs related to PHYB-mediated red light signaling shows phenotypes characterized by short hypocotyls and without any perturbation of light-induced expression of marker genes for chloroplast development. These observations indicate that these PIFs are negative regulators of PHYB signaling pathway (Huq and Quail, 2002) since they repress seedling photomorphogenesis in the dark (Leivar et al., 2008). Recent studies have revealed that PIFs are targeted for rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by photo-activated phytochromes in light (Leivar and Quail, 2011). A similar role can be attributed to PIFs interacting with other phytochromes. Many genes have been identified as being regulated by PIFs. In turn, PIF activity is regulated by different pathways and factors, including various hormonal signals (reviewed by de Lucas and Prat, 2014). A recent study has provided evidence of the involvement of an evolutionarily conserved non-coding RNA in the modulation of red-light mediated photomorphogenesis by direct interaction with PIF3 gene transcription (Wang et al., 2014). Collectively, these results suggest that the PIF family functions as a cellular signaling hub in the phytochrome-mediated pathway controlling seedling photomorphogenesis (Leivar and Quail, 2011).Light signaling is related to auxin signaling Among the pathways regulated by phytochromes and PIFs, the interaction with hormone signaling, especially auxin, is of special interest. Indeed, multiple hormonal pathways are modulated by light to mediate the developmental changes and, conversely, hormone levels also serve as endogenous cues in influencing light responsiveness. In particular, a cross-talk has been shown to exist between PHYB-regulated responses to light signaling and hormone signaling. Mutants impaired in the synthesis or response to gibberellin (GA), brassinosteroids (BR) or auxin suppress the constitutive elongation phenotype of phyB mutants and cause de-etiolated growth in the dark (Alabadí et al., 2004; Nemhauser and Chory, 2004). The finding that PIFs play a direct role in the activation of auxin biosynthesis (Hornitschek et al., 2012) has provided a functional link between these different pathways and their integration to coordinate plant growth and development (Figure 3). In addition, it is known that light regulates the expression of some PIN genes, encoding proteins responsible for the auxin efflux during the transport of this hormone. Enhanced auxin transport by these efflux carriers was reported to mediate the differential elongation of cells in the apical hook (Žádníková et al., 2010; Abbas et al., 2013) as well as during the shade avoidance response (Keuskamp et al., 2010). Apart from PIFs, the transcription factor long hypocotyl 5 (HY5) is a convergence point of light and multiple hormone signaling pathways, such as GA, cytokinin, auxin and abscisic acid (Lau and Deng, 2010). Earlier studies have suggested that HY5 plays a role in suppressing auxin signaling (Cluis et al., 2004), a function which is performed through the activation of its negative regulators. A genome survey of the targets of HY5, using chromatin immunoprecipitation identified potential auxin signaling targets, including a dozen of auxin responsive factors (ARFs; Lee et al., 2007). This relationship of light signaling with hormone signaling may have consequences in establishing the coordination of the growth of different plant organs. It is evident that changes in the environmental conditions do not affect the growth of all organs in the same manner, and, even within a given organ, not all cell types respond equally. Auxin is the most likely candidate to play the coordinator role, assuring balanced responses and equilibrated growth. The integration of the PIF regulatory network in these functions is crucial to drive the differential growth rates of the various plant organs during development and to provide plants with adaptation flexibility (de Lucas and Prat, 2014).Light signaling controls cell cycle One of the most striking characteristics of seedling photomorphogenesis is that the same light signal evokes largely different and sometimes opposite responses in different cells, tissues and organs. Thus, the response to light signaling is cell expansion in cotyledons, repression of growth in the hypocotyl and cell division and growth in meristems (Nemhauser, 2008). Regarding meristem activity, cell cycle progression in these cells is under the control of photoreceptors, as shown after monitoring a collection of mutants defective in phytochromes and cryptochromes (López-Juez et al., 2008). For this control, light initiates several hormonal responses associated with meristem function, among them auxin and cytokinin. A key role in this process is played by two central cell cycle regulators, the E2FB and E2FC transcription factors (Magyar et al., 2005; Jurado et al., 2007; Figure 3). The investigation on the regulation of cell division by photoreceptors is less extensive compared to the research efforts devoted to other photomorphogenetic processes, such as cell elongation and greening. However, the most significant result that triggered the investigation on this topic was the observation that the growth of the shoot apex (meristem) is repressed in darkness but becomes rapidly activated by light (López-Juez et al., 2008). Light triggers the rapid downregulation of expression for specific transcription factors and genes, which leads to the loss of repressors that had been active in the dark. In this process, light also initiates rapid hormonal responses in the shoot apex. Auxin levels are high in the shoot apical meristem in the dark. A large collection of auxin-responsive genes is highly expressed in the shoot apex in the dark and rapidly downregulated by light (Figure 3), indicating that increased auxin concentration and/or responsiveness could be part of the repressive mechanism of meristem function in the dark. The auxin-responsive transcription factor HAT4 was identified as an early red light-repressed gene in etiolated seedlings (Tepperman et al., 2004). On the contrary, the expression of the auxin transporter gene PIN1 was shown to be upregulated by light in the shoot apex. However, these results could be due to direct the auxin flow away from the meristem upon light exposure (López-Juez et al., 2008). At a later point after light activation, coinciding with leaf primordial development, a distinct cohort of auxin upregulated genes are expressed. This determines two stages of the auxin response to light: an early stage, associated with cell cycle activity, characterized by a drop of expression, and a later stage, associated with differentiation, characterized by elevation. Contrary to the results with auxin, cytokinin- and GA-responsive genes are activated by light (López-Juez et al., 2008). During the light activation of meristem development, genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and protein translation are rapidly and synchronously induced, simultaneously with cell proliferation genes, such as B-type CDKs, some A-type cyclins and, slightly later, a group of D-, A-, and B-type cyclins (López-Juez et al., 2008; Figure 3). A similar program of gene expression was described for the process of activation of cell division of the root meristem that drives seed germination (Masubelele et al., 2005). The difference, as inferred from the particular genes, which are activated in each case, is that in root dormant seeds, cells are arrested in G1, whereas in the dark cells are arrested both at G1- and G2-phases. In any case, the synchronic expression of genes regulating cell growth and cell proliferation confirms that the coordination of these two processes (meristematic competence) is essential for the meristem function (Mizukami, 2001; Medina and Herranz, 2010). In relation to the observed coordinated regulation of cell cycle genes, it was reported that light affected the levels of the E2F transcription factor family, constituted by transcriptional regulators playing important roles in the entry into cell proliferation or differentiation. Light increased the levels of E2FB (Figure 3) and decreased the levels of E2FC (López-Juez et al., 2008). E2FB is associated with the regulation of cell proliferation at the two main cell cycle regulatory events, namely the G1-to-S and the G2-to-mitosis checkpoints. The turnover of the E2FB factor is regulated by auxin, which induces the expression of the gene (Magyar et al., 2005). On the contrary, E2FC is a negative regulator of cell proliferation (Gutierrez, 2005). The effect of light on E2F transcription factors is dependent on DET (DEETIOLATED) and COP (CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC) factors, which are essential for the maintenance of skotomorphogenesis in the dark (Møller et al., 2002). In addition to the role played in E2FB turnover, auxin mediates the light signaling effects on cell cycle by responding to changes in the red:far red light ratio. A reduction in this ratio causes arrest of cell cycle progression by inducing the expression of the TIR1 (TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1) gene, involved in auxin transport, and of CKX6 (CITOKININ OXIDASE 6), which reduces the cytokinin levels (Carabelli et al., 2007). Finally, an indirect pathway of cell cycle regulation by light, especially affecting the root meristem, is based on the depletion of sugars caused by the lack of light and the inhibition of photosynthesis (Nishihama and Kohchi, 2013). It was shown that the supply of glucose can reactivate the root meristem (Kircher and Schopfer, 2012). In fact, glucose was shown to activate the TOR (TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN) gene, which, in turn, activates E2FA transcription factor to promote expressions of S-phase genes (Xiong et al., 2013). Moreover, the nucleolar protein nucleolin, which activates ribosome biogenesis in connection to mechanisms of cell cycle regulation, is induced by glucose and sucrose (Kojima et al., 2007) Thus, the light signal perceived by leaves is transmitted by photosynthesis-derived sugars to the root meristem, where they activate cell cycle via different pathways, such as the TOR-E2FA.Red light stimulates factors promoting meristematic competence More than a decade before the literature reported in the preceding section on the light control of cell proliferation, a series of papers originated from the laboratory of Stanley J. Roux clearly demonstrated that light stimuli responsible for photomorphogenesis have activating effects on different factors promoting cell growth and proliferation and their mutual coordination, that is, what has been called meristematic competence. Phytochrome-stimulating red light irradiation is capable of increasing the phosphorylation of nuclear proteins promoted by Ca2+ and calmodulin, an effect generally related to an increase in gene expression (Datta et al., 1985). Furthermore, it was shown that a red-light pulse given to dark-grown seedlings resulted in increasing the cell proliferation activity (i.e., the mitotic index) and in the expression of some relevant nucleolar proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, and in particular, of a nucleolin-like nucleolar protein gene, indicating an increase in the rate of production of ribosomes in the nucleolus (Tong et al., 1997; Reichler et al., 2001; Figure 3).CONCLUDING REMARKS AND PERSPECTIVES Disruption of meristematic competence appears to be a general effect produced by the lack of sensing of a defined gravity vector on undifferentiated proliferating cells of plants, regardless of whether they are meristematic cells from seedlings, or in vitro cultured cells. These results pose two important challenges. The first is the need of obtaining additional information on sensing, transduction and response mechanisms in the different model systems in order to establish the single or multiple pathways involved. The second is to search for countermeasures which could allow overcoming the gravitational stress on board space vehicles and in environments featuring gravity levels different from the Earth nominal levels. With respect to the first challenge, the current extent of our knowledge is schematically summarized in Figure 3. Aspects of the details of these pathways remain unknown due to the lack of experimental data; however, these unknowns provide a summary of the research challenges on this topic in a near future. Thus, we will need to keep exploring altered gravity effects in cell cultures in order to uncover the details of mechanisms of the alteration of meristematic competence, and their potential dependence on auxin and/or on gravitropism-specialized organelles. In addition, further spaceflight missions are required to confirm these findings by using different mutants affecting auxin-responsive elements as well as cell proliferation and cell growth markers, e.g., nucleolin mutants. Regarding the second challenge, the activating effect of light (particularly red illumination) can be of help in restoring meristematic competence under microgravity conditions (Figure 3). The factors which have been shown to be enhanced as a result of phytochrome-mediated photostimulation coincide with those which have been found to be decoupled under gravitational stress, producing the disruption of meristematic competence. In general, many points remain unknown in this cross-talk among different signals (light, gravity), mediators (auxin) and cellular effects (cell proliferation/cell cycle and cell growth/ribosome biogenesis). It is possible that the light stimulus, either alone or in combination with the alteration of gravity, could induce a redistribution of the auxin gradients in the root, which may be different from that produced by the alteration of gravity. The consequence at the cellular level could be a rate of cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis which may reach similar levels as those existing on Earth. Thus, in our upcoming experiments (termed the Seedling Growth Project) on the ISS, we aim to understand how gravity and light responses influence each other and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. Through these experiments, the red-light-dependent phototropic response in flowering plants will be further characterized. In addition, these experiments will consider the combined influence of light and gravity on plant development through the identification of changes in the mechanisms and regulation of root meristematic cell growth and proliferation. Auxin transport and perception will be analyzed as a regulatory process of these cellular functions, which also affects the developmental pattern of the plant. Experiments will test whether red light stimulation is capable of counteracting the effects of the gravitational stress on cell growth and proliferation. Finally, thresholds of response in fractional gravity will be measured to determine whether the red-light effect on blue-light-based phototropism is a direct or indirect effect. In the long term, experiments in fractional gravity produced by a centrifuge on the ISS will be performed to improve the understanding of how plants will grow and develop on the Moon and Mars.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Joshua P.
