    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: It may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR5-ion) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation. Methods: To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months post-radiation. Results: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples (fold-change ≥1.2 and an adjusted p-value of ≤0.05) were identified for each proteomics data set. For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted p-value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR5-ion irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis. Discussion: These findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR5-ion results in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.

    "introduction": "Introduction We recently reported on long term functional changes to the heart following a single dose of GCR5-ion (Bishawi et al., 2022). Physiologically, this dysfunction was manifested as changes in arterial elastance, and histologically, there was evidence of elastin fragmentation in the aorta. Of the protein markers we evaluated (Fibulin-4, Fibulin-5, TGF-beta1, and EGFR), EGFR was the only marker that showed a statistically significant decrease in hearts from GCR-irradiated animals compared to age-matched sham irradiated controls (Bishawi et al., 2022). Other investigations have also examined the levels of individual cardiac protein markers in studies where rodents or rabbits were exposed to components of GCR (reviewed in Davis et al., 2021; Seawright et al., 2019; Amino et al., 2010; Soucy et al., 2011). These studies have indicated that a number of proteins and pathways and biological functions are permanently affected in the heart from a single exposure of space relevant radiation. Seawright et al. (Seawright et al., 2019) noted an increase in a 75 kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle of rats exposed to protons (250 MeV) and 16O (600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n), suggesting that these components of GCR caused remodeling of existing collagens in the heart. Also noted in this study were increases in the amounts of CD2, CD68, and CD45 proteins at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone, suggesting immune cell infiltration. In a rabbit model, hearts exposed to 15 Gy of targeted heavy ion irradiation (THIR) exhibited a significant upregulation of connexin 43 (Cx43) protein and mRNA in the ventricular myocardium by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR from 2 weeks out to 1 year after a single exposure (Amino et al., 2010). Cx43, the major connexin in cardiac gap junction, plays an essential role in the synchronized contraction of the heart and perturbations in Cx43 levels could profoundly influence cardiac function. Soucy et al. examined xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the aortas of rats exposed to whole-body exposure of iron ion radiation (56Fe-ion) at doses of 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy (Soucy et al., 2011). In vivo aortic stiffness and ex vivo aortic tension responses were measured 6 and 8 months after exposure as indicators of chronic vascular injury. Rats exposed to 1 Gy 56Fe-ion demonstrated significantly increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity. XO activity was significantly elevated in rat aorta 4 months after whole-body irradiation. Recently, Azimzadeh et al. published a comprehensive review of the available omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, and multi-omics) of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease focusing on gamma and X-ray exposure (Azimzadeh et al., 2022). Across 27 published proteomics data sets, mitochondrial proteins were the most sensitive protein cluster affected in irradiated hearts across different types and doses of radiation, with many of these mitochondrial proteins being significantly downregulated. In addition, long term downregulation of many anti-oxidant defense proteins was observed in many publication examining mouse models as well as validated in studies of heart autopsies obtained from workers in the nuclear industry. While recently Laiakis et al (2022) have utilized label-free mass spectrometry untargeted quantitative proteomic profiling to characterize the proteome of the prefrontal cortex in rats exposed to 28Si ions, there have been no corresponding studies undertaken to understand the global proteomic changes occurring in the heart following exposure to components of space radiation. As the proteome can provide a better understanding of the structure and the function of the organism than genomics, we have performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from mice exposed to GCR5-ion. Integration of these three omics data sets has enabled a more comprehensive understanding of the systemic impact of GCR5-ion and suggests that sustained inflammatory response with neutrophil extracellular trap formation is one of the major pathways driving the biological responses to space radiation in the heart.",
    "methods": "Methods The overall experimental design is provided in Figure 1. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Overview of sample preparation, processing, and bioinformatics analysis pipeline. Experimental animals All animal experiments were approved by the Duke University and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs). Approximately 24-week old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) were exposed to 150 cGy GCR5-ion (H 1,000 MeV/n, 28Si 600 MeV/n, 4He 250 MeV/n, 16O 350 MeV/n, 56Fe 600 MeV/n, and H 250 MeV/n) using the beam line at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL (Simonsen et al., 2020). Sham irradiated control animals were placed in equitable holders over a schedule which mimicked the experimental groups but were not irradiated. Post-radiation, animals were allowed at least 2 days to recover, and then were returned to Duke University animal facilities. Hearts and plasma for proteomics were obtained from mice at 8 months post radiation (n = 6 for hearts and n = 10 for plasma). An equal number of hearts and plasma samples was obtained from age-matched sham irradiated control animals. Hearts for other evaluations such as Western blot or immunofluorescence studies were obtained from mice at 12 months post radiation and equivalent age-matched sham irradiated control animals were used as comparators. Heart tissue (phospho)proteomics Frozen tissues were weighed and lysed by tissue tearor in 1.5 mL of 5% sodium docecyl sulfate (SDS)/50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 (TEAB) followed by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. The amount of 250 μg of each sample was normalized to 50 μL with SDS/TEAB buffer followed by the addition of bovine casein (300 fmol and 150 fmol per µg added to irradiated and sham irradiated control samples, respectively) and digestion using an S-trap mini device, followed by Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling (with lot# TK2735U and TL272831), high pH-reversed phase (HPRP) fractionation, and phosphopeptide enrichment as previously described (Walejko et al., 2021). One-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (1D-LC-MS/MS) was performed on ∼0.5 μg each of the unenriched fractions, and 2.5 μL of the phosphopeptide-enriched fractions were analyzed using a nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) coupled to a Fusion Lumos high resolution accurate mass tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo) in a time-dependent (3 s) data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode with a 120,000 resolution (@ m/z 200) full MS scan from m/z 375 to 1,600 with a target automatic gain control (AGC) value of 2e5 ions and 50 ms maximum injection time (IT) and internal calibration (eIC) enabled. Peptides were selected for MS/MS using monoisotopic precursor selection (MIPS) and a dynamic exclusion of 45 s. Peptides with charge state 2 (scan priority 1) were selected for MS/MS using an isolation width of 1.2 and higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with a stepped normalized collision energy of 36.1, 38, and 39.9 with detection in the orbitrap using a resolution of 50,000, an AGC target of 1e5, and max IT of 105 ms. Peptides with charge states 3–5 (scan priority 2) were selected for MS/MS with an isolation window of 0.7 m/z. Phosphoproteome data were analyzed using Thermo Proteome Discoverer 2.3. Re-calibrated.mgf Calibrated .mgf files were created the Spectrum Files RC node and database searching was performed against the Uniprot database with Mus musculus taxonomy (downloaded on 04/22/19; 20,204 entries) appended with bovine casein isoform protein sequences. Searches used Mascot v 2.5 with 5 ppm precursor and 0.02 product ion tolerances, trypsin specificity with up to two missed cleavages, fixed carbamidomethylation (Cys) and TMT10 (Lys and peptide N-terminal), and variable phosphorylation (Ser, Thr, and Tyr). Percolator and imp-ptmRS nodes were used for FDR determination and site localization. The processing node of the reporter ions quantifier used a 10 ppm integration tolerance, and the consensus node used correction for isotope impurity, a co-isolation threshold of 50%, and S/N threshold of 5. Normalization to total peptide amount and imputation using low abundance resampling were applied. Proteome data was analyzed in Proteome Discoverer 2.4 using the MS-Fragger (Chang et al., 2023) and Percolator nodes with default parameters. The mouse database was appended with additional contaminant sequences including human keratins. Imputation used low abundance resampling, and protein quantities were calculated from summed peptide abundances. Normalization used sample loading and trimmed mean in R as previously described (Wakeham et al., 2019).Plasma proteomics Plasma proteomics utilized sodium deoxycholate (SDC)-assisted in solution digestion followed by microflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry using variable window data-independent acquisition (DIA) as previously described (Kamyszek et al., 2020) with the following modifications. Briefly, 15 μL of plasma was adjusted to 5% SDC in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 10 mM dithiothreitol followed by reduction at 80°C for 20 min and alkylation with 25 mM iodoacetamide at room temp for 30 min. Proteins were digested with 37.5 μg Worthington modified bovine trypsin for 4 h at 37°C followed by the addition of 1.5% (v/v) trifluoracetic acid and 2% (v/v) acetonitrile and Massprep ADH1 peptide standard (Waters; final concentration 30 fmol ADH1/µl). The SDC precipitate was filtered under vacuum using an ISOLUTE Filtration + filter plate (Biotage) and collected in a Deepwell 96/1,000 µL plate (Eppendorf). Twelve microliters of peptide digest (∼40 μg) were analyzed per sample in a block-randomized order, interspersed with replicates of a study pool QC (SPQC) sample made from a mixture of all samples. Liquid chromatography used a 1 mm × 150 mm 1.7 µm CSH C18 column (Waters) and a ACQUITY UPLC (Waters) at a flow rate of 100 μL/min and a gradient of 3%–28% acetonitrile over 60 min. The LC was interfaced to a Thermo HF-X MS via a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) source. DIA mass spectrometry analysis used a 120,000 resolution precursor ion (MS1) scan from 375 to 1,500 m/z, an AGC target of 3E6, and maximum injection time (IT) of 20 ms; data were collected in profile mode. MS/MS was performed using 30,000 resolution, an AGC target of 3e6 and maximum IT of 60 ms, and 19 variable DIA windows that spanned 375–1,200 m/z. Data were collected in profile mode. In addition, ∼800 μg of the SPQC sample was analyzed using high pH-reversed phase (HPRP) fractionation using a 2.1 mm × 5 cm BEH C18 column (Waters) and Agilent 1100 HPLC as previously described (Glisinski et al., 2020) with a mobile phase of 20 mM ammonium formate, pH 10, and a gradient of 3%–35% MeCN over 50 min. Forty-eight equal fractions were collected and concatenated to 12 fractions. After lyophilization, samples were resuspended in 24 μL of 1% (v/v) TFA/2% (v/v) MeCN in H2O, and 12 μL was analyzed by microflow-DDA using the same LC method as previously described and a 120,000 resolution precursor (MS1) scan from 375 to 1,500 m/z, an AGC target of 3e6, and maximum injection time (IT) of 45 ms, followed by MS/MS (MS2) of the top 10 most abundant ions at 45,000 resolution with an AGC target of 5e4 ions and 86 milliseconds (ms) IT, 1.2 m/z isolation window, a stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) of 25, 27.5, and 30, a minimum AGC target of 1e4, and 20 s dynamic exclusion. Data analysis used Spectronaut 13 (Biognosys). A “hybrid” spectral library (Muntel et al., 2019) was generated from DDA and direct-DIA searches which used a UniProt database with Mus musculus specificity (downloaded on 04/22/19) appended with sequences for yeast ADH1 and bovine cationic trypsin (17,455 total entries). Default settings were used except for the following: no variable modifications and semitryptic peptide N-termini specificity. DIA files were converted to *.htrms format using a HTRMS converter (Biognosys). Default quantification settings were used except that the workflow used indexed retention time profiling of non-identified precursors; options to carryover peak boundaries and unify peptides were selected. For statistical analysis, single hit proteins were excluded, and quantification was performed at MS2 level using summed precursor areas for the top 20 peptides, Q-value percentile (0.3), and cross-run normalization using q-value complete and median global normalization settings. Bioinformatics analysis Data filtering Twenty-two human keratin proteins were excluded from the heart dataset as they were suspected to be contaminants. In addition, two viral proteins (P31748-Murine leukemia virus and P0C6X9-Murine coronavirus) were removed from the analysis. The list of proteins that were excluded are shown in Supplementary Table S9. Statistical analysis of proteomics data Proteomics datasets underwent sample loading (SL) and trimmed mean of M values (TMM) normalizations procedures (Robinson and Oshlack, 2010) to correct for levels of proteins and compositional bias across samples. In addition, a batch correction was performed for the heart data guided by QC results using the ComBat procedures (Johnson et al., 2007). Following this, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples in the heart and plasma data using exact test in edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010). DEPs were filtered for significance using a fold-change ≥ |1.2| and a p-value of ≤0.05. For the phosphoproteomics data, protocols in PhosR package (Kim et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021) were used to identify differential phosphosites, kinase-substrate regulatory interactions, and signaling networks. Protein orthology mapping, pathway enrichment analysis, and clustering Mouse proteins were mapped to their corresponding human orthologs using biomaRt (Durinck et al., 2009) and the Mouse Genome Database (Blake et al., 2021). Then, the results of the ortholog mapping were used as an input to the pathway enrichment analysis pipeline. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique (Subramanian et al., 2005) was then used to assess the perturbation of canonical pathways from Biocarta (BIC), KEGG, WikiPathways (WP), Reactome (RECT), and the Pathway Interaction Database (PID). Finally, pathway enrichment maps were utilized to identify interacting pathways (modules) that might have broader impact in the two heart and plasma proteomics data sets. Enrichment map (Merico et al., 2010) in Cytoscape was used for visualizing the network of pathways. For the phosphoproteomics data, phosphosite (or gene) set enrichment analysis was conducted using the Wilcoxon rank sum test as implemented in the PhosR package. Clustering heatmaps were generated using the coolmap function in the Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) R package (Ritchie et al., 2015). Western blot Mouse heart tissues were mechanically homogenized in Tris Buffered Saline with Tween 20 (TBST) lysis buffer. Protein concentration was determined using BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific #23227, United States) using BioTek Gene 5 software with a 562 nm wavelength. Then, 7.5% precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad #4568026, United States) were run at 100 V for 75 min and transferred to 0.2 μm Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes by electrophoretic transfer through a tank transfer system at a constant voltage of 30 V for 30 min at 4°C. The membrane was blocked overnight with TBST with 5% non-fat milk (w/v). Primary antibodies KRT10 (Thermo Fisher: MA5-32183, United States), KRT1 (Thermo Fisher: 16848-1-AP, United States) KRT6a (Thermo Fisher: 10590-1-AP, United States), MRPL49 (Thermo Fisher: PA5-112889, United States), fibrinogen gamma (Thermo Fisher: PA5-21968, United States), fibrinogen beta (16747-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States), fibrinogen alpha (20645-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States), calmodulin 2 (PA5-121166, Thermo Fisher, United States), alpha 2 macroglobulin (MA5-38211, Thermo Fisher, United States), and CAMK2G (CAMKII-301AP, Thermo Fisher, United States) were incubated for 2 h in TBST with 5% non-fat milk (w/v). The membranes were washed prior to incubation with secondary antibody Anti-Rabbit HRP conjugated Ab from (BioRad: #1706515, United States) for 1 hour and subsequently washed with TBST. Membrane was visualized with Clarity™ Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad # 1705060, United States) for 5 min, and chemiluminescent images were taken using a BioRad Chemidoc. Densitometric analysis was conducted with Image Lab 6.1 software (Bio-Rad: #12012931, United States). Immunofluorescence staining Fresh frozen heart bases were embedded in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. Compound and sectioned to 10 µm. The sections were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich, United States) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). They were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum in 0.1% Tween-20. The primary antibodies used were Fibrinogen beta (16747-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States), Fibrinogen alpha (20645-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States) C4b-BP (PIPA528017; Thermo Fisher, United States), and C4d (HP8033; Hycult Biotech, United States) each at a final dilution of 1:200. After washing, they were incubated with polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated antibody (ab150080; Abcam, United States) at a final dilution of 1:400. ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen, United States) was added onto the section and a coverslip was placed. A Leica 780 Upright Microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) was used to acquire the images of the tissue sections. Immunofluorescence staining for neutrophil extracellular traps Frozen sections of 10 μm, taken from the cardiac apex of mice embedded in OCT, were utilized to investigate the presentation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). To stain the samples, a rabbit anti-elastase antibody (Catalog # PA5-88916, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) diluted 1:100 and a goat anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) primary antibody (AF 3667, R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) diluted to a concentration of 10 μg/mL were employed. Subsequently, the sections were treated with a goat anti-rabbit secondary polyclonal antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Abcam, Cat no. ab150080, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at a dilution of 1:200 and a donkey anti-goat secondary polyclonal antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Catalog # A-11055; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) at a dilution of 1:200. The formation of NETs was examined using a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse inverted confocal microscope. Immunohistochemistry for collagen types I and III Frozen sections of the cardiac apex were treated with anti-COL1A1 antibody (Catalog 72026; CST; United States) at a dilution of 1:100 and with anti-type III collagen antibody (Catalog # PA5-3478716, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) at a dilution of 1:150. This was done after the sections underwent a sequence of processing steps: fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, peroxidase blocking, antigen retrieval, and protein blocking. A horse polyclonal anti-rabbit secondary antibody from the ImmPress HRP Polymer Detection Kit was subsequently applied. These sections were then developed using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution, followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. After dehydration, clearing, and mounting, serial sections stained for collagen I or III were captured using a digital camera on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 Upright Microscope. The stained regions were analyzed using ImageJ software, with five different viewpoints taken from each section. Results are presented as the percentage of the total area for both collagen types I and III.",
    "results": "Results Cardiac and plasma protein abundance and phosphorylation are modestly diminished at 9 months post GCR5-ion exposure For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (Supplementary Table S1); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (Supplementary Table S3); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein (Supplementary Table S2). Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed in order to observe any high-level differences between sample groups (Figures 2A–C). The heart proteome (Figure 2A) and heart phosphoproteome (Figure 2C) were better separated (sham irradiated versus GCR5-ion irradiated) as judged by the two most prominent components (PC1 versus PC2), whereas the plasma proteome from the sham and GCR5-ion irradiated animals were not as well separated by PC1 and PC2 (Figure 2B). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Visualization of proteome and phosphoproteome data sets Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of heart proteome (A); plasma proteome (B); and phosphoproteome (C). Heatmap clustering plot of heart proteome (D); plasma proteome (E); and phosphoproteome (F). Clustering of top 20 proteins in each data set. Proteins are selected based on fold-change difference between GCR5-ion vs. control samples.From the list of significantly changed proteins, we chose the top 20 based on fold change values to create a heatmap as shown in Figures 2D, E (see also Tables 1–3 for more details). The top three DEPs in the cardiac proteome were ATP synthase-coupling factor 6, mitochondrial (ATP5J; AdjPval = 1.53E-28), Troponin C, slow skeletal and cardiac muscles (TNNC1; AdjPval 5.20E-27), and Calmodulin-2 (CALM2; AdjPval = 7.44E-16). The 20 most significant DEPs in the cardiac proteome (Table 1) are involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses, complement activation, calmodulin binding, mitochondrial function, and cardiac contraction. Interestingly, there were two S100 proteins (S100-A6 and S100-A9) in the top cardiac proteome DEPs. TABLE 1. Top 20 proteins: cardiac proteome.

The top 20 proteins in the cardiac phosphoproteome are involved in cardiac function, enzymatic activity, muscle contraction, regulation of transcription and translations, DNA repair, and regulation of neutrophil migration (Table 3). For all three proteomics data sets, the majority of the DEPS were diminished in abundance in GCR5-ion irradiated versus sham irradiated control animals (Figure 3). In the proteome of the heart, there were 76 proteins that were significantly diminished in abundance and 11 proteins that were significantly increased in abundance. In the plasma proteome, there was only one protein with increased abundance after radiation. In the phosphopeptide data set, there were 43 phosphopeptides that were decreased in abundance after radiation and 17 phosphopeptides that increased post radiation. FIGURE 3.

Bar graph showing the number of significantly up- and downregulated proteins for heart proteome (D); plasma proteome (E); and phosphoproteomc (F). A single dose of GCR5-ion permanently changed numerous biological pathways in the heart and plasma The results from both the abundance and phosphoproteomics data sets indicated that there were a number of proteins significantly changed in abundance in response to GCR5-ion. Each data set was analyzed using a bioinformatics/gene functional-enrichment approach, as outlined in the Materials and Methods, to map these changes to cellular location, protein function, and biological pathways. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways affected at 0.1 FDR cutoff. See Supplementary Table S4–S8 for details on all pathways emerging from the bioinformatics/gene functional-enrichment approach. For the heart proteome, the major upregulated enriched pathways were: inflammatory processes (including coagulation cascade, complement cascade), elastic fibers, amino acid metabolism, citric acid cycle, extracellular matrix interactions, integrins, cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, urea cycle, HNF-3B/FOXA2 pathway, and metabolism of fat-soluble vitamins (Figure 4A). Major enriched pathways that were downregulated in the heart proteome were: cell cycle/transcription (CCTR), HIV life cycle, iron uptake and transport, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, insulin glucose pathways, mitochondrial functions (including oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport system), and keratinization/cornification (Figure 4C). The CCTR pathway contained the most proteins and Supplementary Figure S1 shows the complete pathway interaction maps for CCTR. Each of the 72 circles represents a pathway in the interaction map with the size of the circle proportional to the number of proteins annotated with each pathway. Two interacting pathways are connected by a line with the thickness of the line proportional to the number of proteins shared between interacting pathways. FIGURE 4.

The thickness of the line is proportional to the number of proteins shared between interacting pathways. Pathways are annotated with the source database as Biocarta (BIC), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), WikiPathways (WP), Reactome (RECT), and the Pathway Interaction Database (PID).Major enriched pathways that were upregulated in the plasma samples from mice exposed to GCR5-ion included oxidative damage, and metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids, lipids, toxins, and steroids, toxins (Figure 4B). Major enriched pathways that were downregulated in the plasma include inflammatory processes (complement cascade, coagulation), oxidative damage, and cardiac signaling (GPCR and Hippo) (Figure 4D). Inflammatory pathways and processes that were perturbed in both the heart and plasma proteome are examined in more detail in Figure 5. In both the heart and plasma proteome data set, pathways related to inflammatory processes were in the top ten significantly modulated pathways of each (Figures 5A, C). A pathway enrichment map combining both data sets with a focus on the inflammation pathways was generated (Figure 5B). Interestingly, two patterns emerged from this analysis. First, for pathways that were commonly perturbed in the plasma and heart, the pathways were upregulated in the heart and downregulated in the plasma, as shown by the red top half representing the heart and the bottom blue half that representing the plasma. Second, inflammatory pathways that were only perturbed in the plasma were downregulated. FIGURE 5.

Pathways are annotated with the source database as Biocarta (BIC), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), WikiPathways (WP), Reactome (RECT), and the Pathway Interaction Database (PID).Major enriched pathways that were significantly modulated in the phosphoproteomics data set of the heart included many pathways and processes involved in cardiac structure and function such as sarcomere, contractile fiber, I band, muscle cell development, contraction, actin binding, cardiac differentiation, and transmembrane transport. Other pathways significantly perturbed involved inflammatory processes such as neutrophil extracellular trap formation and reactive oxygen species (Figure 6A). Kinases responsible for phosphorylation of major substrates are shown in the heatmap of kinase-substrate interaction (Figure 6B). Notably, MTOR, CAMKG2, and PIM3 emerged as the three kinases responsible for phosphorylating most of the major substrates examined in the analysis. There were 121 proteins that are common between the heart proteome and phosphoproteome (Figure 6C). Of these proteins, there were seven phosphopeptides that were significantly affected in only the phosphoprotome data set (Figure 6D), indicating that the differences in phosphopetpide abundance of these seven phosphopepitides were due to differential phosphorylation at these particular sites rather than differences in protein abundance. These proteins are: RTN2 (reticulon 2), LMOD2 (leiomodin 2), PP1R7 (protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 7), MTCH1 (mitochondrial carrier 1), LNP (lunapark), MIC60 (MICOS complex subunit Mic60), and JPH2 (Junctophilin-2).

Neutrophil extracellular traps were elevated in myocardium of GCR5-ion irradiated mice 12 months post irradiation Western blot analysis was performed on mouse myocardium of 150 cGy GCR5-ion irradiated mice at 12 months and age-matched sham irradiation control (Supplementary Figure S2) to evaluate the expression patterns of selected proteins where antibodies were commercially available. Of the 13 protein targets examined by this methodology, only cytokeratin1 and fibrinogen gamma were statistically significantly different between hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice (Supplementary Figure S2D). Immunofluorescent staining of mouse myocardium for markers of inflammation was also performed. Shown in Supplementary Figure S3 are representative myocardial sections from mice irradiated with 150 cGy GCR5-ion stained for fibrinogen α, fibrinogen β, C4d, and C4b-BP. There was no observed difference in the staining patterns of these protein markers between the GCR5-ion irradiated and sham irradiated mice and there was no significant staining observed in any of the samples. To investigate the histologic presentation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the hearts of mice exposed to GCR5-ion, immunofluorescent staining was performed using anti-neutrophil elastase and anti-MPO antibodies. The staining patterns were compared between the GCR5-ion -exposed mice hearts and the hearts of control mice (Figure 7A). The colocalization of DAPI, MPO, and neutrophil elastase revealed positive staining for NETs in the myocardial tissue of GCR5-ion -treated mice (Figure 7B). The NETs were found to be diffusely distributed in these heart sections, whereas no NETs were observed in any of the control mice hearts. FIGURE 7.

(A) A robust and extensive distribution of NETs was observed in the myocardium of mice exposed to GCR5-ion (upper panel), while no NETs were detected in the control mice hearts (lower panel). (B) The representative images of NETs structure in the hearts of mice exposed to GCR were obtained. The colocalization of extracellular DNA structure (DAPI), MPO, and elastase further confirmed the presence of NET structures (B). The scale bar represents 50 μm.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Based on data from epidemiological studies, it takes a significant amount of time for cardiovascular disease to develop (up to decades). There is relatively little knowledge regarding the time frame to develop cardiovascular disease from exposure to the space radiation environment. Here, we undertook a multi-proteomics approach to characterize protein and pathway perturbations that occurred in hearts and plasma from mice exposed to a single dose of GCR5-ion 8 months prior. One of the most interesting observations was that across the three data sets, the abundance of the majority of the DEPs diminished in the heart and plasma at 8 months post radiation. While one acute effect of radiation is to cause fragmentation and aggregation of protein molecules (Kumta and Tappel, 1961), it is possible that the effects observed at 8 months post radiation may be due to the inhibition of protein synthesis. We previously reported that microgravity, another stressor of space travel, reduced protein turnover in cardiomyocytes (Feger et al., 2016) and speculated that this diminishment in protein synthesis could lead to overall reduction in cardiomyocyte protein content. Calmodulin 2 (CALM2), a signaling protein involved in the calcium-regulated contraction of cardiac muscle (Beghi et al., 2022), was one of the most highly perturbed proteins in the heart proteome in this study. We examined the expression levels of CALM2 as well as an associated kinase (CAMKG2) via Western blots but did not see a statistical difference in abundance of either protein in the hearts of GCR5-ion irradiated mice compared to unirradiated controls (Supplementary Figures S2A, S3C). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were also performed on hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice to validate markers of complement activation (C4d and C4b-BP; Supplementary Figure S3) and coagulation/clotting/fibrin formation (fibrinogen alpha, fibrinogen beta, fibrinogen gamma; Supplementary Figures S2C, S3). From this analysis, only fibrinogen gamma was statistically significantly different between hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice as observed via Western blot analysis (Supplementary Figure S2H). In the plasma proteome, the most significantly regulated protein was major urinary protein 20 (MUP20) which was upregulated in irradiated animals. MUP20 is a male pheromone which promotes aggressive male behavior, stimulates female sexual attraction to male urinary scent, promotes a strong learned attraction to the airborne urinary odor of an individual male, and promotes spatial learning by rapidly conditioning preference for its remembered location among females and competitor males so that animals prefer to spend time in the site even when scent is absent (Roberts et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2010; Demir et al., 2020). While this finding may not be translatable since humans are the only placental mammals found not to have any active MUP genes (Logan et al., 2008), the finding of MUP20 dysregulation in male mice exposed to GCR5-ion may illuminate behavioral and learning changes following exposures of rodents to various GCR components. Other proteins dysregulated in the plasma following GCR irradiation are serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) (upregulated) and glutathione S-transferase theta-3 (GSTT3) (downregulated). SAA1 is a major acute-phase protein mainly produced by hepatocytes in response to infection, tissue injury, and malignancy. SAA has anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting platelet aggregation and by reducing the oxidative burst in Polymorphonuclear neutrophils(Zimlichman et al., 1990; Gatt et al., 1998). SAA also has proinflammatory effects, such as induction of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes, allowing the repair of tissue damage and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-6, and TNFa (Uhlar and Whitehead, 1999). GSTT3 is expressed strongly in the liver (and to a lesser extent in kidney and testis). Glutathione transferases play a significant role in the metabolism/detoxification process of a wide range of electrophilic compounds that include mutagens, carcinogens, reactive oxygen species, and some therapeutic agents. The most highly impacted pathways in the heart tissue were inflammation/complement/coagulation, mitochondria, and cell cycle/transcription (CCTR). The downregulation of the mitochondrial pathways is in line with the comprehensive Azimzadeh et al. review of omics data from radiation induced-cardiovascular disease (Azimzadeh et al., 2022). However, in our study, the CCTR cluster was the most highly affected, as detailed in Supplementary Figure S1, which shows the 72 CCTR processes that are downregulated in the heart 8 months post GCR irradiation. This global downregulation in cell cycle and transcription processes may help explain the overall diminishment in protein abundance noted earlier in the discussion. Perhaps the most interesting finding from this study involves neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs have come to the forefront of immunology for their fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens. Beyond this defensive capacity, intriguingly, NETs have shown the ability to modulate inflammatory responses, even within sterile environments (Papayannopoulos, 2018). One remarkable illustration of this involves the role of cholesterol crystals in prompting the formation of NETs, which subsequently stimulate macrophages to unleash IL-1-beta, a process known to expedite the development of atherosclerosis (Warnatsch et al., 2015). This process becomes particularly concerning when a plaque rupture transpires. The resulting exposure of endovascular NETs can escalate vascular thrombosis, a factor intimately tied to severe cardiovascular events like acute myocardial infarction and stroke (Klopf et al., 2021). Our study has unveiled some illuminating findings in this area. Employing proteomic analysis, we discovered that the NETs formation pathway was activated in mice exposed to Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), and myocardium sections exhibited a significant accumulation of NETs in these mice after long-term high-energy GCR exposure. Our findings align with previous research wherein, in a mouse bladder cancer model receiving radiation therapy, NETs were found to promote their formation through the protein HMGB1 via a TLR4-dependent pathway both in vitro and in vivo (Shinde-Jadhav et al., 2021). Notably, the accumulation of NETs and its components in local areas can inflict damage on healthy tissues. Prior research has linked the increased expression of NETs in the inflamed myocardium to gene expression of collagen type I (Col1a1) and increased the heart stiffness in mouse models (Bai et al., 2019). This correlation may explain our previous findings, which demonstrated decreased systolic heart function and increased arterial elastance 1 year after GCR exposure, as revealed through cardiac-pressure-volume loop analysis (Bishawi et al., 2022). From our limited tissue samples, we observed an increased presence of type I collagen in the GCR-exposed mice, but no significant difference in type III collagen between the two groups (see Supplementary Figure S4). Evidence for persistent activity, as indicated by markers such as MPO and elastase, was noted 8 months post-exposure. However, this study did not include additional markers such as plasma enrichment, quantification of NETotic neutrophils, cleaved caspases, and condensed nuclei, which could have provided further insights into the sustained nature of NETs activity. The findings underscore the need for a more comprehensive investigation with an expanded sample size, controlled left ventricular mass data, and methodical sampling at regular intervals throughout the study to evaluate this phenomenon more accurately. NETs have also been shown to promote the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in mouse models (Brill et al., 2012). A complication associated with cardiovascular degeneration during space flight that was recently brought to light is the occurrence of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs). Approximately 2 months into a mission aboard the International Space Station in 2019, a female astronaut noticed an abnormality during an ultrasound examination (Auñón-Chancellor et al., 2020). Upon further examination and consultation with physicians on Earth, the astronaut was diagnosed with a left internal jugular venous thrombosis. The astronaut presented with no signs or symptoms, and she had no family or personal history of venous thromboembolisms. A therapeutic regimen was quickly established for the astronaut and she was luckily treated in a timely manner. This incidence exemplifies the unknown health consequences associated with unique stressors of the space environment. Although there are other confounding factors that may have contributed to the astronaut’s hypercoagulable state, there is evidence that her exposure to space radiation was a primary constituent. We found NETs presentation in the myocardium, but no significant enrichment of inflammatory cytokines was identified in the plasma. Neutrophils serve as the first-line of innate immunity. The cytokines that trigger NETs formation might be detectable during the acute injury stage. Thus, there is a pressing need for another study that collects samples shortly after GCR exposure to accurately determine what triggers NETs. While the exact mechanism behind NET formation following GCR exposure remains elusive in our study and whether NET formation may have played a role in the astronaut’s development of VTE is unknown, we propose a hypothesis involving chronic tissue damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activation post-radiation exposure as potential mechanisms, warranting further investigation.",

Copyright notice ID: 11063234 PMID: 38699144 Abstract Introduction: It may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR5-ion) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation. Methods: To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months post-radiation. Results: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples (fold-change ≥1.2 and an adjusted p-value of ≤0.05) were identified for each proteomics data set. For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted p-value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR5-ion irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis. Discussion: These findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR5-ion results in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.

Physiologically, this dysfunction was manifested as changes in arterial elastance, and histologically, there was evidence of elastin fragmentation in the aorta. Of the protein markers we evaluated (Fibulin-4, Fibulin-5, TGF-beta1, and EGFR), EGFR was the only marker that showed a statistically significant decrease in hearts from GCR-irradiated animals compared to age-matched sham irradiated controls (Bishawi et al., 2022). Other investigations have also examined the levels of individual cardiac protein markers in studies where rodents or rabbits were exposed to components of GCR (reviewed in Davis et al., 2021; Seawright et al., 2019; Amino et al., 2010; Soucy et al., 2011). These studies have indicated that a number of proteins and pathways and biological functions are permanently affected in the heart from a single exposure of space relevant radiation. Seawright et al. (Seawright et al., 2019) noted an increase in a 75 kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle of rats exposed to protons (250 MeV) and 16O (600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n), suggesting that these components of GCR caused remodeling of existing collagens in the heart. Also noted in this study were increases in the amounts of CD2, CD68, and CD45 proteins at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone, suggesting immune cell infiltration. In a rabbit model, hearts exposed to 15 Gy of targeted heavy ion irradiation (THIR) exhibited a significant upregulation of connexin 43 (Cx43) protein and mRNA in the ventricular myocardium by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR from 2 weeks out to 1 year after a single exposure (Amino et al., 2010). Cx43, the major connexin in cardiac gap junction, plays an essential role in the synchronized contraction of the heart and perturbations in Cx43 levels could profoundly influence cardiac function. Soucy et al. examined xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the aortas of rats exposed to whole-body exposure of iron ion radiation (56Fe-ion) at doses of 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy (Soucy et al., 2011). In vivo aortic stiffness and ex vivo aortic tension responses were measured 6 and 8 months after exposure as indicators of chronic vascular injury. Rats exposed to 1 Gy 56Fe-ion demonstrated significantly increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity. XO activity was significantly elevated in rat aorta 4 months after whole-body irradiation. Recently, Azimzadeh et al. published a comprehensive review of the available omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, and multi-omics) of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease focusing on gamma and X-ray exposure (Azimzadeh et al., 2022). Across 27 published proteomics data sets, mitochondrial proteins were the most sensitive protein cluster affected in irradiated hearts across different types and doses of radiation, with many of these mitochondrial proteins being significantly downregulated. In addition, long term downregulation of many anti-oxidant defense proteins was observed in many publication examining mouse models as well as validated in studies of heart autopsies obtained from workers in the nuclear industry. While recently Laiakis et al (2022) have utilized label-free mass spectrometry untargeted quantitative proteomic profiling to characterize the proteome of the prefrontal cortex in rats exposed to 28Si ions, there have been no corresponding studies undertaken to understand the global proteomic changes occurring in the heart following exposure to components of space radiation. As the proteome can provide a better understanding of the structure and the function of the organism than genomics, we have performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from mice exposed to GCR5-ion. Integration of these three omics data sets has enabled a more comprehensive understanding of the systemic impact of GCR5-ion and suggests that sustained inflammatory response with neutrophil extracellular trap formation is one of the major pathways driving the biological responses to space radiation in the heart.Methods The overall experimental design is provided in Figure 1. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Overview of sample preparation, processing, and bioinformatics analysis pipeline.Experimental animals All animal experiments were approved by the Duke University and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs). Approximately 24-week old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) were exposed to 150 cGy GCR5-ion (H 1,000 MeV/n, 28Si 600 MeV/n, 4He 250 MeV/n, 16O 350 MeV/n, 56Fe 600 MeV/n, and H 250 MeV/n) using the beam line at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL (Simonsen et al., 2020). Sham irradiated control animals were placed in equitable holders over a schedule which mimicked the experimental groups but were not irradiated. Post-radiation, animals were allowed at least 2 days to recover, and then were returned to Duke University animal facilities. Hearts and plasma for proteomics were obtained from mice at 8 months post radiation (n = 6 for hearts and n = 10 for plasma). An equal number of hearts and plasma samples was obtained from age-matched sham irradiated control animals. Hearts for other evaluations such as Western blot or immunofluorescence studies were obtained from mice at 12 months post radiation and equivalent age-matched sham irradiated control animals were used as comparators. Heart tissue (phospho)proteomics Frozen tissues were weighed and lysed by tissue tearor in 1.5 mL of 5% sodium docecyl sulfate (SDS)/50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 (TEAB) followed by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. The amount of 250 μg of each sample was normalized to 50 μL with SDS/TEAB buffer followed by the addition of bovine casein (300 fmol and 150 fmol per µg added to irradiated and sham irradiated control samples, respectively) and digestion using an S-trap mini device, followed by Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling (with lot# TK2735U and TL272831), high pH-reversed phase (HPRP) fractionation, and phosphopeptide enrichment as previously described (Walejko et al., 2021). One-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (1D-LC-MS/MS) was performed on ∼0.5 μg each of the unenriched fractions, and 2.5 μL of the phosphopeptide-enriched fractions were analyzed using a nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) coupled to a Fusion Lumos high resolution accurate mass tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo) in a time-dependent (3 s) data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode with a 120,000 resolution (@ m/z 200) full MS scan from m/z 375 to 1,600 with a target automatic gain control (AGC) value of 2e5 ions and 50 ms maximum injection time (IT) and internal calibration (eIC) enabled. Peptides were selected for MS/MS using monoisotopic precursor selection (MIPS) and a dynamic exclusion of 45 s. Peptides with charge state 2 (scan priority 1) were selected for MS/MS using an isolation width of 1.2 and higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with a stepped normalized collision energy of 36.1, 38, and 39.9 with detection in the orbitrap using a resolution of 50,000, an AGC target of 1e5, and max IT of 105 ms. Peptides with charge states 3–5 (scan priority 2) were selected for MS/MS with an isolation window of 0.7 m/z. Phosphoproteome data were analyzed using Thermo Proteome Discoverer 2.3. Re-calibrated.mgf Calibrated .mgf files were created the Spectrum Files RC node and database searching was performed against the Uniprot database with Mus musculus taxonomy (downloaded on 04/22/19; 20,204 entries) appended with bovine casein isoform protein sequences. Searches used Mascot v 2.5 with 5 ppm precursor and 0.02 product ion tolerances, trypsin specificity with up to two missed cleavages, fixed carbamidomethylation (Cys) and TMT10 (Lys and peptide N-terminal), and variable phosphorylation (Ser, Thr, and Tyr). Percolator and imp-ptmRS nodes were used for FDR determination and site localization. The processing node of the reporter ions quantifier used a 10 ppm integration tolerance, and the consensus node used correction for isotope impurity, a co-isolation threshold of 50%, and S/N threshold of 5. Normalization to total peptide amount and imputation using low abundance resampling were applied. Proteome data was analyzed in Proteome Discoverer 2.4 using the MS-Fragger (Chang et al., 2023) and Percolator nodes with default parameters. The mouse database was appended with additional contaminant sequences including human keratins. Imputation used low abundance resampling, and protein quantities were calculated from summed peptide abundances. Normalization used sample loading and trimmed mean in R as previously described (Wakeham et al., 2019).Plasma proteomics Plasma proteomics utilized sodium deoxycholate (SDC)-assisted in solution digestion followed by microflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry using variable window data-independent acquisition (DIA) as previously described (Kamyszek et al., 2020) with the following modifications. Briefly, 15 μL of plasma was adjusted to 5% SDC in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 10 mM dithiothreitol followed by reduction at 80°C for 20 min and alkylation with 25 mM iodoacetamide at room temp for 30 min. Proteins were digested with 37.5 μg Worthington modified bovine trypsin for 4 h at 37°C followed by the addition of 1.5% (v/v) trifluoracetic acid and 2% (v/v) acetonitrile and Massprep ADH1 peptide standard (Waters; final concentration 30 fmol ADH1/µl). The SDC precipitate was filtered under vacuum using an ISOLUTE Filtration + filter plate (Biotage) and collected in a Deepwell 96/1,000 µL plate (Eppendorf). Twelve microliters of peptide digest (∼40 μg) were analyzed per sample in a block-randomized order, interspersed with replicates of a study pool QC (SPQC) sample made from a mixture of all samples. Liquid chromatography used a 1 mm × 150 mm 1.7 µm CSH C18 column (Waters) and a ACQUITY UPLC (Waters) at a flow rate of 100 μL/min and a gradient of 3%–28% acetonitrile over 60 min. The LC was interfaced to a Thermo HF-X MS via a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) source. DIA mass spectrometry analysis used a 120,000 resolution precursor ion (MS1) scan from 375 to 1,500 m/z, an AGC target of 3E6, and maximum injection time (IT) of 20 ms; data were collected in profile mode. MS/MS was performed using 30,000 resolution, an AGC target of 3e6 and maximum IT of 60 ms, and 19 variable DIA windows that spanned 375–1,200 m/z. Data were collected in profile mode. In addition, ∼800 μg of the SPQC sample was analyzed using high pH-reversed phase (HPRP) fractionation using a 2.1 mm × 5 cm BEH C18 column (Waters) and Agilent 1100 HPLC as previously described (Glisinski et al., 2020) with a mobile phase of 20 mM ammonium formate, pH 10, and a gradient of 3%–35% MeCN over 50 min. Forty-eight equal fractions were collected and concatenated to 12 fractions. After lyophilization, samples were resuspended in 24 μL of 1% (v/v) TFA/2% (v/v) MeCN in H2O, and 12 μL was analyzed by microflow-DDA using the same LC method as previously described and a 120,000 resolution precursor (MS1) scan from 375 to 1,500 m/z, an AGC target of 3e6, and maximum injection time (IT) of 45 ms, followed by MS/MS (MS2) of the top 10 most abundant ions at 45,000 resolution with an AGC target of 5e4 ions and 86 milliseconds (ms) IT, 1.2 m/z isolation window, a stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) of 25, 27.5, and 30, a minimum AGC target of 1e4, and 20 s dynamic exclusion. Data analysis used Spectronaut 13 (Biognosys). A “hybrid” spectral library (Muntel et al., 2019) was generated from DDA and direct-DIA searches which used a UniProt database with Mus musculus specificity (downloaded on 04/22/19) appended with sequences for yeast ADH1 and bovine cationic trypsin (17,455 total entries). Default settings were used except for the following: no variable modifications and semitryptic peptide N-termini specificity. DIA files were converted to *.htrms format using a HTRMS converter (Biognosys). Default quantification settings were used except that the workflow used indexed retention time profiling of non-identified precursors; options to carryover peak boundaries and unify peptides were selected. For statistical analysis, single hit proteins were excluded, and quantification was performed at MS2 level using summed precursor areas for the top 20 peptides, Q-value percentile (0.3), and cross-run normalization using q-value complete and median global normalization settings.Bioinformatics analysis Data filtering Twenty-two human keratin proteins were excluded from the heart dataset as they were suspected to be contaminants. In addition, two viral proteins (P31748-Murine leukemia virus and P0C6X9-Murine coronavirus) were removed from the analysis. The list of proteins that were excluded are shown in Supplementary Table S9.Statistical analysis of proteomics data Proteomics datasets underwent sample loading (SL) and trimmed mean of M values (TMM) normalizations procedures (Robinson and Oshlack, 2010) to correct for levels of proteins and compositional bias across samples. In addition, a batch correction was performed for the heart data guided by QC results using the ComBat procedures (Johnson et al., 2007). Following this, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples in the heart and plasma data using exact test in edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010). DEPs were filtered for significance using a fold-change ≥ |1.2| and a p-value of ≤0.05. For the phosphoproteomics data, protocols in PhosR package (Kim et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021) were used to identify differential phosphosites, kinase-substrate regulatory interactions, and signaling networks.Protein orthology mapping, pathway enrichment analysis, and clustering Mouse proteins were mapped to their corresponding human orthologs using biomaRt (Durinck et al., 2009) and the Mouse Genome Database (Blake et al., 2021). Then, the results of the ortholog mapping were used as an input to the pathway enrichment analysis pipeline. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique (Subramanian et al., 2005) was then used to assess the perturbation of canonical pathways from Biocarta (BIC), KEGG, WikiPathways (WP), Reactome (RECT), and the Pathway Interaction Database (PID). Finally, pathway enrichment maps were utilized to identify interacting pathways (modules) that might have broader impact in the two heart and plasma proteomics data sets. Enrichment map (Merico et al., 2010) in Cytoscape was used for visualizing the network of pathways. For the phosphoproteomics data, phosphosite (or gene) set enrichment analysis was conducted using the Wilcoxon rank sum test as implemented in the PhosR package. Clustering heatmaps were generated using the coolmap function in the Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) R package (Ritchie et al., 2015).Western blot Mouse heart tissues were mechanically homogenized in Tris Buffered Saline with Tween 20 (TBST) lysis buffer. Protein concentration was determined using BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific #23227, United States) using BioTek Gene 5 software with a 562 nm wavelength. Then, 7.5% precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad #4568026, United States) were run at 100 V for 75 min and transferred to 0.2 μm Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes by electrophoretic transfer through a tank transfer system at a constant voltage of 30 V for 30 min at 4°C. The membrane was blocked overnight with TBST with 5% non-fat milk (w/v). Primary antibodies KRT10 (Thermo Fisher: MA5-32183, United States), KRT1 (Thermo Fisher: 16848-1-AP, United States) KRT6a (Thermo Fisher: 10590-1-AP, United States), MRPL49 (Thermo Fisher: PA5-112889, United States), fibrinogen gamma (Thermo Fisher: PA5-21968, United States), fibrinogen beta (16747-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States), fibrinogen alpha (20645-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States), calmodulin 2 (PA5-121166, Thermo Fisher, United States), alpha 2 macroglobulin (MA5-38211, Thermo Fisher, United States), and CAMK2G (CAMKII-301AP, Thermo Fisher, United States) were incubated for 2 h in TBST with 5% non-fat milk (w/v). The membranes were washed prior to incubation with secondary antibody Anti-Rabbit HRP conjugated Ab from (BioRad: #1706515, United States) for 1 hour and subsequently washed with TBST. Membrane was visualized with Clarity™ Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad # 1705060, United States) for 5 min, and chemiluminescent images were taken using a BioRad Chemidoc. Densitometric analysis was conducted with Image Lab 6.1 software (Bio-Rad: #12012931, United States).Immunofluorescence staining Fresh frozen heart bases were embedded in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. Compound and sectioned to 10 µm. The sections were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich, United States) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). They were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum in 0.1% Tween-20. The primary antibodies used were Fibrinogen beta (16747-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States), Fibrinogen alpha (20645-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States) C4b-BP (PIPA528017; Thermo Fisher, United States), and C4d (HP8033; Hycult Biotech, United States) each at a final dilution of 1:200. After washing, they were incubated with polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated antibody (ab150080; Abcam, United States) at a final dilution of 1:400. ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen, United States) was added onto the section and a coverslip was placed. A Leica 780 Upright Microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) was used to acquire the images of the tissue sections.Immunofluorescence staining for neutrophil extracellular traps Frozen sections of 10 μm, taken from the cardiac apex of mice embedded in OCT, were utilized to investigate the presentation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). To stain the samples, a rabbit anti-elastase antibody (Catalog # PA5-88916, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) diluted 1:100 and a goat anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) primary antibody (AF 3667, R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) diluted to a concentration of 10 μg/mL were employed. Subsequently, the sections were treated with a goat anti-rabbit secondary polyclonal antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Abcam, Cat no. ab150080, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at a dilution of 1:200 and a donkey anti-goat secondary polyclonal antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Catalog # A-11055; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) at a dilution of 1:200. The formation of NETs was examined using a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse inverted confocal microscope.Immunohistochemistry for collagen types I and III Frozen sections of the cardiac apex were treated with anti-COL1A1 antibody (Catalog 72026; CST; United States) at a dilution of 1:100 and with anti-type III collagen antibody (Catalog # PA5-3478716, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) at a dilution of 1:150. This was done after the sections underwent a sequence of processing steps: fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, peroxidase blocking, antigen retrieval, and protein blocking. A horse polyclonal anti-rabbit secondary antibody from the ImmPress HRP Polymer Detection Kit was subsequently applied. These sections were then developed using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution, followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. After dehydration, clearing, and mounting, serial sections stained for collagen I or III were captured using a digital camera on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 Upright Microscope. The stained regions were analyzed using ImageJ software, with five different viewpoints taken from each section. Results are presented as the percentage of the total area for both collagen types I and III.Results Cardiac and plasma protein abundance and phosphorylation are modestly diminished at 9 months post GCR5-ion exposure For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (Supplementary Table S1); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (Supplementary Table S3); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein (Supplementary Table S2). Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed in order to observe any high-level differences between sample groups (Figures 2A–C). The heart proteome (Figure 2A) and heart phosphoproteome (Figure 2C) were better separated (sham irradiated versus GCR5-ion irradiated) as judged by the two most prominent components (PC1 versus PC2), whereas the plasma proteome from the sham and GCR5-ion irradiated animals were not as well separated by PC1 and PC2 (Figure 2B). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Visualization of proteome and phosphoproteome data sets Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of heart proteome (A); plasma proteome (B); and phosphoproteome (C). Heatmap clustering plot of heart proteome (D); plasma proteome (E); and phosphoproteome (F). Clustering of top 20 proteins in each data set. Proteins are selected based on fold-change difference between GCR5-ion vs. control samples.From the list of significantly changed proteins, we chose the top 20 based on fold change values to create a heatmap as shown in Figures 2D, E (see also Tables 1–3 for more details). The top three DEPs in the cardiac proteome were ATP synthase-coupling factor 6, mitochondrial (ATP5J; AdjPval = 1.53E-28), Troponin C, slow skeletal and cardiac muscles (TNNC1; AdjPval 5.20E-27), and Calmodulin-2 (CALM2; AdjPval = 7.44E-16). The 20 most significant DEPs in the cardiac proteome (Table 1) are involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses, complement activation, calmodulin binding, mitochondrial function, and cardiac contraction. Interestingly, there were two S100 proteins (S100-A6 and S100-A9) in the top cardiac proteome DEPs. TABLE 1. Top 20 proteins: cardiac proteome.

The top 20 proteins in the cardiac phosphoproteome are involved in cardiac function, enzymatic activity, muscle contraction, regulation of transcription and translations, DNA repair, and regulation of neutrophil migration (Table 3). For all three proteomics data sets, the majority of the DEPS were diminished in abundance in GCR5-ion irradiated versus sham irradiated control animals (Figure 3). In the proteome of the heart, there were 76 proteins that were significantly diminished in abundance and 11 proteins that were significantly increased in abundance. In the plasma proteome, there was only one protein with increased abundance after radiation. In the phosphopeptide data set, there were 43 phosphopeptides that were decreased in abundance after radiation and 17 phosphopeptides that increased post radiation. FIGURE 3.

Bar graph showing the number of significantly up- and downregulated proteins for heart proteome (D); plasma proteome (E); and phosphoproteomc (F).A single dose of GCR5-ion permanently changed numerous biological pathways in the heart and plasma The results from both the abundance and phosphoproteomics data sets indicated that there were a number of proteins significantly changed in abundance in response to GCR5-ion. Each data set was analyzed using a bioinformatics/gene functional-enrichment approach, as outlined in the Materials and Methods, to map these changes to cellular location, protein function, and biological pathways. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways affected at 0.1 FDR cutoff. See Supplementary Table S4–S8 for details on all pathways emerging from the bioinformatics/gene functional-enrichment approach. For the heart proteome, the major upregulated enriched pathways were: inflammatory processes (including coagulation cascade, complement cascade), elastic fibers, amino acid metabolism, citric acid cycle, extracellular matrix interactions, integrins, cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, urea cycle, HNF-3B/FOXA2 pathway, and metabolism of fat-soluble vitamins (Figure 4A). Major enriched pathways that were downregulated in the heart proteome were: cell cycle/transcription (CCTR), HIV life cycle, iron uptake and transport, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, insulin glucose pathways, mitochondrial functions (including oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport system), and keratinization/cornification (Figure 4C). The CCTR pathway contained the most proteins and Supplementary Figure S1 shows the complete pathway interaction maps for CCTR. Each of the 72 circles represents a pathway in the interaction map with the size of the circle proportional to the number of proteins annotated with each pathway. Two interacting pathways are connected by a line with the thickness of the line proportional to the number of proteins shared between interacting pathways. FIGURE 4.

Pathways are annotated with the source database as Biocarta (BIC), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), WikiPathways (WP), Reactome (RECT), and the Pathway Interaction Database (PID).Major enriched pathways that were upregulated in the plasma samples from mice exposed to GCR5-ion included oxidative damage, and metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids, lipids, toxins, and steroids, toxins (Figure 4B). Major enriched pathways that were downregulated in the plasma include inflammatory processes (complement cascade, coagulation), oxidative damage, and cardiac signaling (GPCR and Hippo) (Figure 4D). Inflammatory pathways and processes that were perturbed in both the heart and plasma proteome are examined in more detail in Figure 5. In both the heart and plasma proteome data set, pathways related to inflammatory processes were in the top ten significantly modulated pathways of each (Figures 5A, C). A pathway enrichment map combining both data sets with a focus on the inflammation pathways was generated (Figure 5B). Interestingly, two patterns emerged from this analysis. First, for pathways that were commonly perturbed in the plasma and heart, the pathways were upregulated in the heart and downregulated in the plasma, as shown by the red top half representing the heart and the bottom blue half that representing the plasma. Second, inflammatory pathways that were only perturbed in the plasma were downregulated. FIGURE 5.

(B) Pathway enrichment map showing inflammation pathways that are perturbed in common in the heart and plasma proteome data sets. Each rectangle represents a pathway. The rectangle is split in two.

Pathways are annotated with the source database as Biocarta (BIC), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), WikiPathways (WP), Reactome (RECT), and the Pathway Interaction Database (PID).Major enriched pathways that were significantly modulated in the phosphoproteomics data set of the heart included many pathways and processes involved in cardiac structure and function such as sarcomere, contractile fiber, I band, muscle cell development, contraction, actin binding, cardiac differentiation, and transmembrane transport. Other pathways significantly perturbed involved inflammatory processes such as neutrophil extracellular trap formation and reactive oxygen species (Figure 6A). Kinases responsible for phosphorylation of major substrates are shown in the heatmap of kinase-substrate interaction (Figure 6B). Notably, MTOR, CAMKG2, and PIM3 emerged as the three kinases responsible for phosphorylating most of the major substrates examined in the analysis. There were 121 proteins that are common between the heart proteome and phosphoproteome (Figure 6C). Of these proteins, there were seven phosphopeptides that were significantly affected in only the phosphoprotome data set (Figure 6D), indicating that the differences in phosphopetpide abundance of these seven phosphopepitides were due to differential phosphorylation at these particular sites rather than differences in protein abundance. These proteins are: RTN2 (reticulon 2), LMOD2 (leiomodin 2), PP1R7 (protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 7), MTCH1 (mitochondrial carrier 1), LNP (lunapark), MIC60 (MICOS complex subunit Mic60), and JPH2 (Junctophilin-2).

Of the 13 protein targets examined by this methodology, only cytokeratin1 and fibrinogen gamma were statistically significantly different between hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice (Supplementary Figure S2D). Immunofluorescent staining of mouse myocardium for markers of inflammation was also performed. Shown in Supplementary Figure S3 are representative myocardial sections from mice irradiated with 150 cGy GCR5-ion stained for fibrinogen α, fibrinogen β, C4d, and C4b-BP. There was no observed difference in the staining patterns of these protein markers between the GCR5-ion irradiated and sham irradiated mice and there was no significant staining observed in any of the samples. To investigate the histologic presentation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the hearts of mice exposed to GCR5-ion, immunofluorescent staining was performed using anti-neutrophil elastase and anti-MPO antibodies. The staining patterns were compared between the GCR5-ion -exposed mice hearts and the hearts of control mice (Figure 7A). The colocalization of DAPI, MPO, and neutrophil elastase revealed positive staining for NETs in the myocardial tissue of GCR5-ion -treated mice (Figure 7B). The NETs were found to be diffusely distributed in these heart sections, whereas no NETs were observed in any of the control mice hearts. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab The presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) within the myocardial tissue was observed in a mouse model exposed to GCR5-ion. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to assess the presence of NETs in the hearts of mice exposed to 150 mGy of GCR5-ion at 12 months post radiation, as compared to sham irradiated control mice hearts. (A) A robust and extensive distribution of NETs was observed in the myocardium of mice exposed to GCR5-ion (upper panel), while no NETs were detected in the control mice hearts (lower panel). (B) The representative images of NETs structure in the hearts of mice exposed to GCR were obtained. The colocalization of extracellular DNA structure (DAPI), MPO, and elastase further confirmed the presence of NET structures (B). The scale bar represents 50 μm.Discussion Based on data from epidemiological studies, it takes a significant amount of time for cardiovascular disease to develop (up to decades). There is relatively little knowledge regarding the time frame to develop cardiovascular disease from exposure to the space radiation environment. Here, we undertook a multi-proteomics approach to characterize protein and pathway perturbations that occurred in hearts and plasma from mice exposed to a single dose of GCR5-ion 8 months prior. One of the most interesting observations was that across the three data sets, the abundance of the majority of the DEPs diminished in the heart and plasma at 8 months post radiation. While one acute effect of radiation is to cause fragmentation and aggregation of protein molecules (Kumta and Tappel, 1961), it is possible that the effects observed at 8 months post radiation may be due to the inhibition of protein synthesis. We previously reported that microgravity, another stressor of space travel, reduced protein turnover in cardiomyocytes (Feger et al., 2016) and speculated that this diminishment in protein synthesis could lead to overall reduction in cardiomyocyte protein content. Calmodulin 2 (CALM2), a signaling protein involved in the calcium-regulated contraction of cardiac muscle (Beghi et al., 2022), was one of the most highly perturbed proteins in the heart proteome in this study. We examined the expression levels of CALM2 as well as an associated kinase (CAMKG2) via Western blots but did not see a statistical difference in abundance of either protein in the hearts of GCR5-ion irradiated mice compared to unirradiated controls (Supplementary Figures S2A, S3C). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were also performed on hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice to validate markers of complement activation (C4d and C4b-BP; Supplementary Figure S3) and coagulation/clotting/fibrin formation (fibrinogen alpha, fibrinogen beta, fibrinogen gamma; Supplementary Figures S2C, S3). From this analysis, only fibrinogen gamma was statistically significantly different between hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice as observed via Western blot analysis (Supplementary Figure S2H). In the plasma proteome, the most significantly regulated protein was major urinary protein 20 (MUP20) which was upregulated in irradiated animals. MUP20 is a male pheromone which promotes aggressive male behavior, stimulates female sexual attraction to male urinary scent, promotes a strong learned attraction to the airborne urinary odor of an individual male, and promotes spatial learning by rapidly conditioning preference for its remembered location among females and competitor males so that animals prefer to spend time in the site even when scent is absent (Roberts et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2010; Demir et al., 2020). While this finding may not be translatable since humans are the only placental mammals found not to have any active MUP genes (Logan et al., 2008), the finding of MUP20 dysregulation in male mice exposed to GCR5-ion may illuminate behavioral and learning changes following exposures of rodents to various GCR components. Other proteins dysregulated in the plasma following GCR irradiation are serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) (upregulated) and glutathione S-transferase theta-3 (GSTT3) (downregulated). SAA1 is a major acute-phase protein mainly produced by hepatocytes in response to infection, tissue injury, and malignancy. SAA has anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting platelet aggregation and by reducing the oxidative burst in Polymorphonuclear neutrophils(Zimlichman et al., 1990; Gatt et al., 1998). SAA also has proinflammatory effects, such as induction of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes, allowing the repair of tissue damage and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-6, and TNFa (Uhlar and Whitehead, 1999). GSTT3 is expressed strongly in the liver (and to a lesser extent in kidney and testis). Glutathione transferases play a significant role in the metabolism/detoxification process of a wide range of electrophilic compounds that include mutagens, carcinogens, reactive oxygen species, and some therapeutic agents. The most highly impacted pathways in the heart tissue were inflammation/complement/coagulation, mitochondria, and cell cycle/transcription (CCTR). The downregulation of the mitochondrial pathways is in line with the comprehensive Azimzadeh et al. review of omics data from radiation induced-cardiovascular disease (Azimzadeh et al., 2022). However, in our study, the CCTR cluster was the most highly affected, as detailed in Supplementary Figure S1, which shows the 72 CCTR processes that are downregulated in the heart 8 months post GCR irradiation. This global downregulation in cell cycle and transcription processes may help explain the overall diminishment in protein abundance noted earlier in the discussion. Perhaps the most interesting finding from this study involves neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs have come to the forefront of immunology for their fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens. Beyond this defensive capacity, intriguingly, NETs have shown the ability to modulate inflammatory responses, even within sterile environments (Papayannopoulos, 2018). One remarkable illustration of this involves the role of cholesterol crystals in prompting the formation of NETs, which subsequently stimulate macrophages to unleash IL-1-beta, a process known to expedite the development of atherosclerosis (Warnatsch et al., 2015). This process becomes particularly concerning when a plaque rupture transpires. The resulting exposure of endovascular NETs can escalate vascular thrombosis, a factor intimately tied to severe cardiovascular events like acute myocardial infarction and stroke (Klopf et al., 2021). Our study has unveiled some illuminating findings in this area. Employing proteomic analysis, we discovered that the NETs formation pathway was activated in mice exposed to Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), and myocardium sections exhibited a significant accumulation of NETs in these mice after long-term high-energy GCR exposure. Our findings align with previous research wherein, in a mouse bladder cancer model receiving radiation therapy, NETs were found to promote their formation through the protein HMGB1 via a TLR4-dependent pathway both in vitro and in vivo (Shinde-Jadhav et al., 2021). Notably, the accumulation of NETs and its components in local areas can inflict damage on healthy tissues. Prior research has linked the increased expression of NETs in the inflamed myocardium to gene expression of collagen type I (Col1a1) and increased the heart stiffness in mouse models (Bai et al., 2019). This correlation may explain our previous findings, which demonstrated decreased systolic heart function and increased arterial elastance 1 year after GCR exposure, as revealed through cardiac-pressure-volume loop analysis (Bishawi et al., 2022). From our limited tissue samples, we observed an increased presence of type I collagen in the GCR-exposed mice, but no significant difference in type III collagen between the two groups (see Supplementary Figure S4). Evidence for persistent activity, as indicated by markers such as MPO and elastase, was noted 8 months post-exposure. However, this study did not include additional markers such as plasma enrichment, quantification of NETotic neutrophils, cleaved caspases, and condensed nuclei, which could have provided further insights into the sustained nature of NETs activity. The findings underscore the need for a more comprehensive investigation with an expanded sample size, controlled left ventricular mass data, and methodical sampling at regular intervals throughout the study to evaluate this phenomenon more accurately. NETs have also been shown to promote the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in mouse models (Brill et al., 2012). A complication associated with cardiovascular degeneration during space flight that was recently brought to light is the occurrence of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs). Approximately 2 months into a mission aboard the International Space Station in 2019, a female astronaut noticed an abnormality during an ultrasound examination (Auñón-Chancellor et al., 2020). Upon further examination and consultation with physicians on Earth, the astronaut was diagnosed with a left internal jugular venous thrombosis. The astronaut presented with no signs or symptoms, and she had no family or personal history of venous thromboembolisms. A therapeutic regimen was quickly established for the astronaut and she was luckily treated in a timely manner. This incidence exemplifies the unknown health consequences associated with unique stressors of the space environment. Although there are other confounding factors that may have contributed to the astronaut’s hypercoagulable state, there is evidence that her exposure to space radiation was a primary constituent. We found NETs presentation in the myocardium, but no significant enrichment of inflammatory cytokines was identified in the plasma. Neutrophils serve as the first-line of innate immunity. The cytokines that trigger NETs formation might be detectable during the acute injury stage. Thus, there is a pressing need for another study that collects samples shortly after GCR exposure to accurately determine what triggers NETs. While the exact mechanism behind NET formation following GCR exposure remains elusive in our study and whether NET formation may have played a role in the astronaut’s development of VTE is unknown, we propose a hypothesis involving chronic tissue damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activation post-radiation exposure as potential mechanisms, warranting further investigation.Acknowledgments We would like to thank members of the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL), Peter Guida PhD, Adam Rusek PhD, James Jardine, Paula Bennet, Michael Sievert PhD, and Deborah Snyder.

    "abstract": "Abstract The vestibular system receives a permanent influence from gravity and reflexively controls equilibrium. If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored. Keywords: mollusks, gravity sensing, statocyst, neuroplasticity, vestibular system, gravitaxis",
    "introduction": "Introduction Vertebrates and invertebrates sense inertial acceleration and a change in orientation with respect to gravity by mechanoreceptors in the otolith and statolith organs, respectively. The force of gravity is constantly present on Earth and forms the frame of reference for spatial orientation. Inertial accelerations occur within this gravity frame of reference naturally during self-generated movements or those imparted externally onto the organism by perturbations, such as a slippery surface or a deflected leaf. Kreidl (1893) demonstrated in a clever manner that the statocyst is a mechanosensitive organ. As a crayfish molts, it leaves behind the statolith and must manually re-seed its statocyst with a new, typically sand, weight-lending mass. Kreidl replaced the sand with reduced ferrous oxide and manipulated the crayfish's posture using a magnet, thereby simulating the action of the normal gravitational field with a magnetic one. Despite the simplicity of the gastropod organ of balance, there are many functional similarities between the snail's statocyst and the more highly evolved otolith organs of vertebrate species (Popova and Boyle, 2015). Statoreceptors, like hair cells in the vertebrate utricle and saccule, are mechanoreceptors that depend on a weight-lending mass to provide a shearing deformation of the underlying ciliary processes to sense position and acceleration with respect to gravity. The mechanoreceptors provide the neural code to the reflex mechanisms that control balance and equilibrium and restore the organism to its appropriate posture and orientation. The first vertebrate ear was in essence a graviceptive statocyst (Budelmann, 1988), and only later in evolution did angular acceleration sensation appear as the animal increased its locomotor mobility and developed a flexible neck (Straka et al., 2014). In vertebrates the vestibular-induced compensatory action is both tonic and dynamic and distributed mainly to the motor circuits controlling the extensor, or antigravity, muscles (Wilson and Jones, 1979). In the absence of gravity and thus an opposing force, even as brief as 5–11 days, astronauts lose about 20% muscle mass (Fitts et al., 2001; Demontis et al., 2017). The changes observed on the skeletomotor system by spaceflight are largely predicted by the mechanical unloading of the body mass: a large skeletal frame to manage muscle contractions about joints is no longer needed and muscle atrophy and osteopenia occur. This same causality might predict a comparable deterioration of vestibular mechanosensory function by space flight: no signal and thus no gain in the system. Surprisingly, despite the permanence of gravity during the evolutionary courses of vertebrates and invertebrates in an otherwise changing environment, the mechanosensory structures do not progressively degenerate, at least not in the short term. Extraordinarily challenging recordings taken during spaceflight from bullfrog otolith afferents by Bracchi et al. (1975) and Gualtierotti (1977) and vestibular neurons and ocular gaze in alert monkeys by Kozlovskaya and her colleagues (reviewed in Cohen et al., 2005) were interpreted as showing an increased sensitivity in measured responses, at least in the early periods of the missions. Otolith afferents in the teleost toadfish exhibited a profound hypersensitivity when tested to inertial accelerations upon return to Earth which recovered back to normal after several days (Boyle et al., 2001). A more recent study in astronauts exposed to long-term space missions aboard the International Space Station have shown a deceased otolith-mediated responses elicited by centrifugation after 6 months of spaceflight which also fully recovered within ~9 days after return (Hallgren et al., 2016). The results in vertebrates exposed to space missions indicate the importance of the duration of exposure to space and the time frame in which measures are taken. On Earth the orientation of the gravitational acceleration defines the vertical, and although the gravitational vertical is lost in space, the astronaut uses other cues, such as vision to perceive an “up” orientation (Clément et al., 2007). The land snail Helix lucorum Linnaeus (Pulmonata, Gastropoda) also orients to the vertical using its bilateral statocysts and visual receptors, and can actually move against the force of gravity using a sticky excretion. We selected the land snail for a month-long study on an unmanned orbiting satellite for many reasons, such as their small size permitting a sufficient sample size given our volume limit, snails are hardy and can remain metabolically active under confined conditions for the duration of the mission, snails do not require elaborate life support systems, recordings can be made directly from the sensory receptors themselves (Balaban et al., 2011; Popova and Boyle, 2015), and importantly certain snail behaviors and their underlying cellular circuits are well described (Balaban, 2002). In the present study snails spent 30 days under conditions of weightlessness and darkness, thereby removing its normal cues of the vertical. Under return to Earth the postflight snails were compared to four separate control groups to identify the adaptive changes at the behavioral, structural, molecular, and neurophysiological levels. Based on the present results we also recalculated our previous Foton-M3 data to confirm the findings in separate missions and establish a time course of response readaptation or recovery of function after a spaceflight.",

    "results": "Results Early phases of gravitaxis reaction When the platform upon which the snail is attached is suddenly pitched from horizontal to vertical, the snail displays a fear-like reaction by fully or partially withdrawing its tentacles (designed phase 0; Figure 1A). This reaction (latency of withdrawal is <1 s) is believed mediated by the gravi-sensing statocyst organ, the snail's equivalent to a vertebrate's vestibular otolith organ. Therefore, the differences in magnitude and time (duration) of the resulting tentacle elongation phase likely reveal changes in reaction of the snail's statocyst. We define the phase of fast elongation of tentacles before the snail starts to turn its body as the T0 phase of gravitaxis (Figure 1A). Our previous report (Balaban et al., 2011) did not follow this convention, and thus the behavior seen in phase T0 of Figure 2A does not correctly align with our current convention because the length of tentacles were not fully extended. At the end of T0 phase the rapid tentacle elongation is complete and the black eyes on their tips are clearly recognizable in most of the records, both of which occur before the head actually starts to move. Snails often start turning to T1 phase immediately after some amount of “hesitation” or scanning the space around them by moving the head from side to side. There was no significant difference between groups in the count of scanning movements (p = 0.114 by Fisher's Exact Test with Monte-Carlo simulated p-value based on 99999 replicates); 82 of 88 (93%) snails of all groups turned the body to position the head above the shell in T2 phase.

A comparison of phase T0 duration between the postflight (PF) to the four control groups reveals statistically significant shortening (panel C) of T0 in PF snails (KW p < 0.006, DBH p adj max = 0.011 for PF-OL comparison; mean ± 95% CI). Due to the nature of this measured parameter, there are few extreme outliers in the dataset (q.v. Supplementary Materials). Robust methods are recommended to deal with such samples to improve the power of statistics, and indeed they return p ≤ 0.001 in KW and DBH tests, thereby providing strong support for a shorter phase T0 in PF than in the other four control groups of snails. No statistical differences of T0 latency were found between the four control groups, even with the application of powerful randomization methods on filtered datasets. A comparison of phase T1 latency between PF to the four control groups shows no statistically significant difference between them (KW p = 0.195). There are few outliers in the dataset, so we applied robust statistics as well, which resulted only in marginal significance (KW p = 0.039, DBH padj = 0.01 for PF-ST only). A similar result was found with T1 duration (T1 latency–T0 latency), with an insignificant difference between groups (KW p = 0.106) in unfiltered dataset and significant for only two control groups if Tukey's outliers were filtered out (KW p = 0.02, DBH padj = 0.003 for PF-ST and padj = 0.023 for PF-DK). With respect to phase T2 latency a similar result was observed. The comparison of this phase between PF to the four control groups again showed no statistically significant difference between them (KW p = 0.223). There are a few outliers in the dataset, so we used robust statistics here as well, which resulted in only marginal significance (KW p = 0.046, DBH reveals no significant padj-values). No significant differences for T2 duration, and also for the later phases T3 and T4 latency and duration, were found or at best a marginal one between two groups in comparison only (q.v. Supplementary Materials for details). Tentacles withdrawal during gravitaxis reaction Changes of tentacle length during the gravitaxis behavior are shown in Figure 2A. No significant asymmetry in tentacle withdrawal reaction was found in any group (p = 0.483, dependent t-test), and thus data for left and right tentacles were averaged. A comparison of phase 0 tentacle withdrawal reaction (Figure 2B) of the four control groups to the PF group reveals that PF snails are retracting their tentacles to a lesser degree than the snails in each control group (KW p = 0.009, DBH padj < 0.035 for 3 of 4 control groups, and insignificant padj = 0.1 for PF-ST comparison). The later dynamics of the tentacle lengths show more complicated differences between the groups. After a relatively fast elongation of the tentacles during phase T0 (8–15 s), the snails in all groups slowly elongated their tentacles ~10–30% more during T1 phase (Figure 2A). After phase T1 tentacle length reached a plateau in all control groups, with a higher length seen in OL snails than in the NV, ST, and DK snails (insignificantly during T1-T2, at tendency level (p < 0.1) at T3, and significantly for T4 (against all groups including PF: KW p = 0.02, DBH padj max = 0.049; Figure 2C). The tentacle length of PF snails during the late gravitaxis phases showed different dynamics (Figure 2A). At T1 it reached a maximum (~130% of T0, close to OL group value), and then gradually declined over time to ~T0 length at the end of T4 phase. The same data in Figure 2A are normalized in Figure 2D for tentacle length at phase T1 as 100%, but the procedure did not change the direction of observed effects. Inter-tentacle angle during gravitaxis reaction The dynamics of the angle between tentacles was measured in certain phases of gravitaxis reaction and are shown in Figure S1A. No significant differences between groups were found except the delta angle (T0-0) difference, which is significant for PF-NV and OL-NV comparisons (KW p = 0.013, DBH padj = 0.029 and padj = 0.019; Figure S1B). More powerful statistical methods were applied but failed to reveal any additional differences among the snail groups (q. v. Supplementary Materials). Correlation analysis of gravitaxis reaction A correlation analysis was made between the merged datasets of the four control groups and the PF dataset (Figure 3). Phase T1-T4 latencies and durations are positively correlated among themselves in both PF and joined control group of snails, as well as tentacle length, and, to a lesser amount, the inter-tentacle angles. In the PF group correlations between inter-tentacle angles of early and late phases is higher than in controls. Delta (T0-0) inter-tentacle angle is weakly positively correlated with tentacle length in controls but not in the PF group. In PF group delta (T0-0) is correlated with latency, but no such a correlation was seen in the merged control. As expected, the number of head scanning movements is positively correlated with latency for all phases. In control dataset tentacle lengths show weak negative correlations with temporal parameters (most pronounced and significant for T0 latency and length, Figure 3A). For the PF group no such a correlation was found (Figure 3B). Latencies and inter-tentacle angles show weak negative correlations in both PF and control groups. In PF group tentacle lengths show weak positive correlations with inter-tentacle angle (although insignificant with the sample size used), in contrast to control dataset showing no such correlation. Positive correlation of snail weight with duration of “ascending” phases T2 and T3 is more pronounced in PF group then in control, also as negative correlation with duration of T1. Figure 3.

Foton-M3 behavioral data reanalysis The behavioral data from a 2007 Foton-M3 12-day orbital satellite mission were analyzed before for latency of gravitaxis phases (Balaban et al., 2011), but the small sample size did not allow us to make any statistically supported conclusions. The design of Foton-M3 experiment was slightly different: gravitaxis responses only up to phase T2 were recorded, and the same preflight snails were used as control group. Here we reanalyze the Foton-M3 behavioral records following the same workflow as Bion-M1 data to test the confidence of our main findings (Figure S2). The latency of T0 phase of Foton-M3 postflight group had a tendency to be shorter than in their preflight control measures (median 9.5 vs. 12.5 s, n = 10, p = 0.112 in dependent t-test). Tentacle withdrawal reaction in postflight group of snails was weaker than in the same snails in preflight tests (median 60.45 vs. 34% of T0 length, p = 0.002 in dependent t-test), and showed no difference with the control in late phases (Figure S2B). Differences in the inter-tentacle angles in Foton-M3 data (Figure S2C) are close to significance level: for postflight group phase 0 and T0 angles were smaller, than for preflight control (p = 0.025 and p = 0.067 correspondingly in dependent t-test); the delta (T0-0) angle was higher in postflight group (p = 0.051 in dependent t-test). Conclusively, Foton-M3 data reanalysis revealed the differences in postflight 2007 group in the same direction as in Bion-M1 postflight group. Statoconia structure The surface structure of the statoconia mass from groups PF, OL and ST was imaged by SEM to examine the role of possible statoconia growth after 30-day exposure to μG conditions (Figure 4). Although the sample size is small (one statocyst in each group), no crustations or “flake-like” structures were observed in the statoconia of the PF sample that might indicate a deposition of calcium carbonate; no differences were found in either statoconia shape or surface structure between groups. The statoconia areas were calculated from SEM images in ImageJ ROI manager, and a tracing tool with minimal manual correction selected each region. No significant difference was found between groups (μm2, PF: 218.9 ± 12.24, OL: 196.6 ± 12.59, ST: 235.5 ± 14.8, n. s. padj ≥ 0.43 in DBH pairwise comparisons against PF group). Figure 4.

Columns represent statoconia preparations from different groups: (A,D), PF group; (B,E), OL group; (C,F), ST group. Transcriptome analysis of statocysts We allocated 3,544 transcripts with a significant difference between FPKM values in the control (ST) and experiment (PF-e) groups. These transcripts were annotated by BLAST homology finding. NP database was used for alignment. There were 2,288 proteins annotated. It is useful to note that many transcripts have similar annotation. For example, Cd-specific metallothionein gene was found 373 times. Possible explanations may be a clustering of similar genes or a very aggressive PCR. Fifty of the most significant differential expression genes (p < 0.05) are listed in Table S1 and the most interesting of them are shown on the heatmap diagram of Figure 5. Among the most significant differentially expressed genes are the neuronal specific precursors of neuropeptides, neurotransmitter receptor subunits, and other genes involved in cell signaling. This result of transcriptome analysis unambiguously identified the statocyst itself as the site of neural plasticity during the process of readaptation to normal gravity after spaceflight. Raw data were deposited at  Bioproject, accession number PRJNA400816. Figure 5. Open in a new tab The heatmap for FPKM value of most significant differential expression genes. Electrophysiological study of statocyst reflex arc In naïve snails we studied the reflex arc from statocyst sensory neurons to command and motoneurons for a defensive withdrawal behavior. Brief and weak electric shocks, delivered to statocyst nerve, exert an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or triggers an action potential in Pa2 and Pa28 neurons (Figure 6). The EPSP shape and its latency suggest a polysynaptic mechanism via unidentified interneurons. Figure 6.

Stimulation of n. vestibularis exerts EPSP (A) or an action potential (B) in ipsi- and contralateral command neurons for defensive behavior. Background statocyst activity In Bion-M1 postflight and the four control groups we recorded background statocyst activity and induced responses to tilts in different directions. Background firing rate in preparations of different groups was not statistically different, although OL and especially DK preparations had increased level of background activity (spikes per second, PF: 6.46 ± 0.7, OL: 8.14 ± 0.89, DK: 10.25 ± 1.0, ST: 6.6 ± 0.55, NV: 6.94 ± 1.1; DBH all against PF n. s., minimal padj = 0.072 for PF-DK comparison, more statistics are available as Supplementary Materials). Electrophysiological studies: technical controls Many factors can affect the recorded responses of statocysts, and thus we attempted to control as many of them as possible to reveal the effect of microgravity exposure on the vestibular system. Short-term plasticity (habituation or sensitization) during an experiment can affect neural responses, so our protocol controlled it by a fixed inter-stimulus interval and a fixed sequence of stimuli, where the first four tilts were excluded from the analysis. Additional experiments were made to study the stability of nerve responses to a long sequence of stimuli (exhaustive control, Figure S3), and to a sequence with a reversed order of stimuli (Figure S4). There is also the possibility of long-term circadian changes of responses, as it was shown for the snail lip sensory nerve (Voss et al., 1997); this factor might influence the results because the recordings of PF snails commenced after their arrival to the lab at night. To exclude such a possibility we provide additional experiments with our isolated CNS-statocysts preparations (Figure S5). Results of these technical controls allow us to analyze the data acquired by the main protocol. Postflight increase of statocyst response to vestibular stimulation Averaged statocyst responses to stimuli for all groups are shown in Figure 7. The number of spikes in the range (1.4–3.2) s in response to head-down tilt (c1) is significantly greater in PF snails than that in other snails (PF: 80.4 ± 4.44, OL: 52.58 ± 3.42, DK: 61.85 ± 4.55, ST: 68.68 ± 3.26, NV: 65.21 ± 5.05; DBH all against PF padj ≤ 0.026 after removing of 3 outliers in ST group). The number of spikes in the range (1.7–2.0) s in response to tilt in direction tail down (c3) is significantly more in group PF than in other groups (PF: 18.3 ± 1.24, OL: 13.05 ± 0.83, DK: 14.31 ± 1.47, ST: 13.88 ± 0.96, NV: 14.29 ± 0.87; DBH all against PF padj ≤ 0.045). Both adjusted p-values are close to marginal value, so these results must be viewed with caution. Control groups show no homogeneity: preparations of two groups with more controlled factors, OL and DK, responded with smaller gain (number of spikes after the tilt, normalized to background firing rate) than preparations of NV and ST groups, Figures 7C,E (for c1 OL: 3.93 ± 0.3, DK: 3.56 ± 0.21, ST: 5.93 ± 0.6 NV: 5.82 ± 0.75, DBH padj ≤ 0.007).

Adaptation to microgravity The 30-day exposure to μG conditions in the Bion-M1 mission, as well as the shorter 12-day duration of the Foton-M3 mission, significantly affected the responses of the PF snails. Postflight snails of both projects arrived at the lab at comparable times (first nerve recording ~14 h after landing), and the same protocol was used in all preparations. As a result we can compare neural responses to identical tilt stimuli in the two postflight groups to check the dependence of statocyst adaptation to μG on the duration of mission. Figure 8 shows the comparison of statocyst tilt responses to mission duration. No statistically significant difference in number of spikes between the two postflight groups was found in pairwise comparisons [to tilt 3,050 ms range (1.1–2.9) s PF: 70.15 ± 3.84 vs. PF2007: 72.5 ± 8.042, KW p = 0.72; for tilt 550 ms range (0.2–1.4) s PF: 52.59 ± 2.73 vs. PF2007: 54 ± 5.74, KW p = 0.8], suggesting the response adaptation to μG reaches a plateau at a time shorter than 12 days. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Comparison of Bion-M1 and Foton-M3 postflight groups reveals an independence of microgravity adaptation on mission duration.

Filled symbols represent PF snails and open symbols the corresponding control snails (see legend box). Readaptation to normal gravity Once the satellite leaves orbit it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. At this point the organism experiences a hyper-gravity force until touchdown, about 45 min later. Readaptation likely begins during the re-entry phase and determines how quickly the organism recovers. The first and last nerve recordings of PF snails were made 14.75 and 26.13 h after landing, respectively. The PF snails were split into an early PF-e (<20 h after landing) and late PF-l (>20 h after landing) subgroups, and compared individually to the OL snails to reveal the process of readaptation of statocyst function. The statocyst response of PF-e subgroup was significantly larger than that of PF-l subgroup and most OL snails (Figure 9). Responses to tilt in the range (0.5–1.7) s were significantly larger in the two analyzed directions in PF-e subgroup (for c1 PF-e: 54.67 ± 4.16, PF-l: 36.75 ± 7.11, OL: 31 ± 2.13, DBH pairwise comparison against PF-e padj = 0.073 (n. s.—but padj = 0.03 with Tukey post-hoc test) for PF-l and padj = 0.002 for OL; for c3 (PF-e: 46.17 ± 3.64, PF-l: 29.75 ± 2.29, OL: 27.47 ± 1.89, DBH pairwise comparison against PF-e padj = 0.038 for PF-l and padj = 0.001 for OL). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Splitting PF group by the time of recordings after touchdown reveals the time course of the re-adaptation process.

(B,D), Cumulative curves of responses for the same stimuli, normalized to background firing rate. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.The readaptation process in two different missions was compared by similarly splitting the electrophysiological data of Foton-M3 by time of preparation recording at 20 h after landing. Only two preparations were recorded before this critical time, but the overall picture is very similar to that obtained from Bion-M1 dataset (Figure S6). Statistics for such a small sample may be not reliable, but the required confidence level was reached for difference between early and lately recorded PF2007 subgroups, also as with control DK2007 group [range (1.3–2.2) s pairwise comparison against PF2007-e: 54 ± 2 vs. 32 ± 4.9 PF2007-l, padj = 0.04, DK2007: 21.88 ± 3.11, padj = 0.003; Tukey post-hoc test]. Activity of vestibular efferent neurons One of the possible mechanisms of the statocyst activity modulation is by tuning the sensory cells via the central vestibular efferent fibers synapsing onto the statoreceptors. We were able to distinguish the activity of statocyst efferent neurons in our n. vestibularis records by spike sorting of single units with inverted polarity of spikes (i.e., traveling in centrifugal direction to statocyst). A possible efferent role in vestibular modulation was examined by comparing peri-stimulus curves of efferent activity in the different groups of snails (Figure 10). Efferent activity was found only in part of the preparations in any group, and in every case it was monotonous firing with OFF-responses to bursts of statocyst activity. No significant difference in efferent activity between groups was found [KW p = 0.78 (−4.9 − −1.9) s; KW p = 0.14 (0.2–2.9) s]. Such a pattern of activity and the lack of a significant correlation of it between the groups suggest a likely negligible influence of vestibular efferents on the background and induced activity of statocyst in our preparations. We studied also the effect of light ON- and OFF-stimuli in semi-intact preparations with intact eyes and found no light effect on activity of statocyst efferents and sensory cells (Figure S7).

Effect of tilt direction on statocyst response and single unit analysis Responses to tilt in the direction of head down to horizon position (c1) were larger than any other vestibular stimuli in preparations from all control groups and the PF group (see Figures S4, S8). The effect was more profound in the period immediately after the stimulus end (tonic response), and more obvious on cumulative plots (Figure S9). Experiments using a reversed order of stimuli (to control for conditioning) showed that there is some effect of the sequence (note the increased response to c4 direction on Figure S4); but even if the stimulus in c1 direction was presented last in the sequence, it generated the larger response of the statocyst. In μG conditions statoreceptors are “unloaded” in contrast to normal gravity, and thus have less contact with the weight-lending statoconia. If an adaptation process occurs, the increase in sensitivity of statoreceptors may be expected. We analyzed the tilt responses of whole nerve activity at single unit level, namely the presumed single statoreceptors in two snail groups, PF-e and OL. The activity of single statoreceptors may signify an activation (ON-responses) or inhibition (OFF-responses) to vestibular stimuli, and varying phasic or tonic behavior might enrich the responses. All possible combinations of activity pattern were found in our recordings (Figure S10). First we plotted the averaged responses to different stimuli for two single units with a maximal phasic response (in 5 s) to either stimulus c1 or c3 (Figure 11). These single units contributed ~30% of the overall background firing level in the statocyst nerve, but showed a very weak sensitivity to vestibular stimuli (ON- responses to any stimulus), suggesting they presumably represented ventrally located statoreceptors, (Figures 11A–C). No increased tonic activity to c1 stimulus was found in these single units, so it cannot be the substrate of directional sensitivity we had found in net responses. Background firing rate of single units in PF-e group is similar to the one in OL group, but the responses are significantly larger (KW p < 0.001), Figure 11D. Another analyzed single unit's pattern was characterized by low or no background firing rate in the horizontal position and phasic-tonic responses to vestibular stimuli in only one direction (Figure 12). By the direction of its sensitivity the response likely originated from a frontally located statoreceptors for direction c1 Figures 12A,C,D) and from a caudally located cells for c3 (Figure 12B). These statoreceptors also showed dramatic difference between OL and PF-e groups, and no increased tonic activity for c1 direction. From single unit analysis only one explanation remains for increased responses for direction c1, observed in all groups. As Helix statocyst contains 13 statoreceptors, the unpaired cell, located at the anterior pole of the statocyst, drives the increase in response to head down tilt (c1). This cell responds to c1 stimulus and does not respond to any other stimulus presented (Figure 13). Figure 11. Open in a new tab Single unit analysis of statocyst activity.

    "discussion": "Discussion Behavioral studies Upon entry into orbit the satellite is in a constant free fall back toward Earth and the traveler feels weightless. The neural gravity sensors that control normal balance and equilibrium are now forced to operate in a unique environment. The present experiments sought to identify the consequences of a 30-day orbital mission on the behavioral performance of snails challenged by a vestibular perturbation after return to normal 1G starting 14–15 h after landing. To account for possible environmental and habitat factors of unmanned spaceflights that can affect measured parameters of behavior other than those related to the state of weightlessness, we designed four control groups based on housing, food and water availability, and lighting, and included a landing-like simulation. In brief, we found that the behavioral phases most directly correlated with gravity sensation were the most affected by the vestibular perturbations tested as soon as the snails reached the laboratory after landing. To distinguish μG-affected parameters, we made multiple group analysis of variance comparisons for each variable (q.v. Supplementary Materials). It reveals significant changes in the early phase of gravitaxis reaction parameters in the postflight (PF) group: the degree of tentacles withdrawal at the initial phase 0 was smaller (Figure 2B), and followed by shorter latency of tentacles protraction (T0, Figure 1C). Both findings were replicated in the data from an earlier 12-day Foton-M3 mission (T0 latency at the tendency level, phase 0 withdrawal highly significant; Figure S2). After the snail pivots to the head-up position (late T3-T4 phases), the length of tentacles becomes shorter in the PF group in comparison to 3 control groups (Figure 2). At the same time in the fourth control group, termed statocyst-affected “overloading” (landing simulation, OL), the tentacle length at T4 is significantly higher than that of the PF snails or any control snail, a finding that promotes a speculation on the opposite effect of overloading (hypergravity) and unloading (μG) exposure on the functions controlled by snail statocysts. The cause of a lesser T2 latency in Foton-M3 postflight group in comparison to Bion-M1 PF group may be attributed to smaller snails used in Foton-M3 project (3–8 vs. 8–25 g, muscle mass/shell weight ratio is higher for young snails, allowing faster movements). We studied subgroups of young snails (3–8 g) in OL controls, but no correlation of T2 duration with weight was found (q.v. Supplementary Data). For the gravitaxis reaction, the snails affected by prolonged μG exposure show stronger correlations with snail weight than do control snails (Figure 3), thus suggesting a probable explanation of a shorter T2 phase in Foton-M3 postflight snails. Snails belonging to the same genus of Helix (H. aspersa), the common garden snail, were exposed to increased gravitation by centrifugation for 16 and 32 days and showed an increased latency or slowing of T3 phase of gravitaxis (Popova and Boyle, 2015). In the data of Bion-M1 project opposite effects in PF snails to the control snails were not seen. There is no consistency between the different Bion-M1 control groups in this parameter, although two groups with most controlled conditions (DK and OL) did show shorter T1-T4 latencies than PF group. For Foton-M3 data (with comparable snail size used), all available latencies (up to T2) are shorter than in preflight controls, thus in agreement with the hypothesis that gravitaxis temporal parameters will change in an opposite fashion after μG than after hypergravity. No differences in T4 duration between μG PF and control groups of snails were found in the data of Bion-M1, also in agreement with the previous study of hypergravity influences and the assumption that the T4 phase may reflect more motor than vestibular function in snails (Popova and Boyle, 2015). A correlation analysis of Bion-M1 behavioral data found T1-T4 phase latencies and durations were positively correlated among themselves in both PF and joined control snails, suggesting a stability of gravitaxis speed during the entire T1-T4 sequence (“slow snails are always slow”). The tentacle length in phases T1-T4 in both PF and control snails showed a positive inter-relation, suggesting the stability of withdrawal reaction during gravitaxis reaction (“afraid snails are always afraid”). Inter-tentacle angles are also positively correlated among themselves during the entire gravitaxis reaction (0-T4), although to a lesser extent than tentacle length and temporal parameters, probably due to the transient nature of this parameter. The tentacle lengths at T0 in the four merged control groups showed weak negative correlations with temporal parameters, together with T0 latency with tentacle length at many phases (Figure 3A). This finding may be interpreted that snails exhibiting more fear (retract tentacles shorter) complete the gravitaxis reaction more slowly. For PF snails such a correlation disappears (Figure 3B), supposedly because the disturbance of statocysts function shortly after landing results in less confidence to vestibular stimuli (habituation of response). Vestibular stimuli sensed by statocysts were shown to be connected to tentacles withdrawal and generalized defensive reaction in snails (see Figure 6 here; Balaban, 1993). Pierantoni (1983) showed the connection of the vertical angle of tentacles and the function of snail statocysts using a spinning disk, and speculated that the vertical angle between the tentacles and the surface is associated with fear in the snail and will depend on the inclination of surface. Inter-tentacle angle in land snails has been investigated mostly in the context of olfactory orientation (Chase and Croll, 1981; Davis, 2004; Davis-Berg, 2012), although tentacle connection with collumellar musculature and hydroskeleton may provide some mechanistic relation of the inter-tentacle angle with muscular or hydraulic tonus of snail; for example, in experiments with predatory snails inter-tentacle angle seems to be correlated with speed of snail crawling (Davis, 2004; Davis-Berg, 2012). In our experiments inter-tentacle angles were measured from the screenshots of different phases of gravitaxis reaction, and the analysis revealed a tendency of the angle to become narrower in late phases in all groups of Bion-M1 and Foton-M3 experiments (Figures S1A, S2C). No specific effects of prolonged μG (PF snails) or short centrifugation (OL snails) on inter-tentacle angle were found in Bion-M1 experiments, although a decrease of inter-tentacle angle in all phases of gravitaxis was found in Foton-M3 experiment (Figure S2C). A possible cause for this discrepancy is a difference of experimental design: repeated testing of snails in Foton-M3 project as opposed to only one test in Bion-M1 snails. Both PF and OL groups show differences in opposite directions in comparison to three other controls in tentacle length at late gravitaxis phase T4 (Figure 2A). Both groups are statocyst-affected, but in an opposite direction, as OL snails were shortly centrifuged, and PF snails were exposed to prolonged μG (plus very similar overloads as OL during landing). In our physiological experiments no changes in background statocyst activity were found, but the response to vestibular stimulation was significantly stronger in PF group in comparison to control groups, and responses of OL group were weaker compared to other control groups (Figure 7). Such physiological differences may underlie the observed behavioral differences. Transcriptome analysis of statocysts The changes in neural cells' morphology, biochemistry and genes expression under space flight conditions are widely accepted (Honda et al., 2012; Pani et al., 2013; Ranjan et al., 2014; Tsybko et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Porseva et al., 2017). Among the most significant differentially expressed genes in PF snails are the neuronal specific precursors of neuropeptides, neurotransmitter receptor subunits, and other genes involved in cell signaling. Gene expression of both the pedal and FMRF-amide peptides were tested by in situ hybridization in earlier Foton studies (Balaban et al., 2011), and were found to be differentially expressed in Bion-M1 PF snails in comparison to ST control snails. In the present Bion-M1 study the genes for these peptides were significantly downregulated in PF-e samples (see Figure 5 and Table S1). In Foton studies preproFMRF-amide gene was found unaltered in control and postflight statocysts using the ISH technique, and preproHPep was found to be upregulated in certain receptor cells. Such discrepancy with Bion-M1 may be explained at least in part by different sensitivity of methods used and also a different Helix species (Helix aspersa L.) was used in Foton-M3 ISH experiment. Adaptation to spaceflight and readaptation process The present study confirmed the electrophysiological findings observed in two earlier Foton satellite missions (Balaban et al., 2011). This study also benefitted from the earlier Foton missions: an earlier animal return to the lab after touchdown was achieved (chartered jet and police escort from the airport) and the experimental protocols evolved to capture as much data as possible in the shortest period of time. Statocyst responses in PF snails of Bion-M1 were comparable to their counterparts in Foton-M3 (see Figure 8), despite more than a 2-fold difference in mission duration. The finding of a postflight hypersensitivity to tilt was confirmed at the level of the whole nerve and single statoreceptor analyses (see Figures 11–13). The statocyst background rate remained unchanged as in the 2007 mission. These findings suggest we measured on a plateau portion of the sensitivity adaptation process, and that the mechanisms underlying in-flight changes, i.e., the μG-induced influence, in statocyst responses are established before 12 days in orbit. We were able to identify the critical time of readaptation to Earth 1G, at ~20 h after landing. Interestingly, hypersensitivity of sensory neurons after spaceflight was found not only in vestibular system, but also in mechanosensory receptors of human skin (Lowrey et al., 2014). The response sensitivity of utricular afferents in the vertebrate toadfish, Opsanus tau, taken post-landing of the orbiters STS-90 (NeuroLab; 16 days in orbit) and STS-95 (9 days in orbit) missions revealed an induced profound hypersensitivity to translational acceleration tests (Boyle et al., 2001). Recordings were also made in separate populations of afferents at numerous time periods after landing to track the rate of recovery. Although some afferents remained hypersensitive, the population as a whole recovered within 24–36 h comparable to readaptation time of snail sensory cells and experienced astronauts, and a bit shorter than a 2–3 day space motion sickness period reported in astronauts during 1G readaptation following 6-month manned missions (Heer and Paloski, 2006). It can be argued in the vertebrate that the rate of adaptation to spaceflight and its recovery after return to Earth are more consistent with a restructuring of the synaptic organization between the hair cells and the afferents, such as adjusting the number of synaptic ribbons or bodies (Ross, 2000), than a restructuring the weight-lending otolith (see below). The toadfish study could not identify whether the hypersensitivity originated in the hair cell, the hair cell-afferent complex, or postsynaptically in the afferent itself. In our Foton and Bion-M1 studies in the snail statocyst we recorded directly from the output of the statoreceptors themselves. Although it is tempting to speculate that the hair cells in vertebrates are also the targets of the sensitivity adjustment to altered gravity loads, direct evidence is still lacking. Vestibular sensitivity in the statocyst of the garden snail was recently studied following exposure to hyper-gravity conditions using centrifugation (Popova and Boyle, 2015). A significant decrease in response sensitivity to head-down tilt was detected after 16- and 32-day (but not 4-day) exposures to a 1.4G [resultant = √1G (Earth)2 + 1G (centripetal)2]. After a 7-day recovery period in normal 1G the responses returned to normal. In accordance with the present study the prevalent gravity level appears represented as a continuum in statocyst function over the measured periods of time. Critical data that are missing and subject to future investigations are the initial responses of the statocyst and organism to an abrupt change in gravity load, the functional and structural consequences of long-term exposure to altered gravity, and the time course of recovery of function as a function of load and duration of exposure. Light cycle influences on the statocyst response Activity recorded in the lip sensory nerve in semi-intact Helix preparations can reflect the circadian phase to which the snail is adapted (Voss et al., 1997). In that study chemical stimuli presented in the light elicited an increased neural response when they corresponded in time to the snail's normal active phase of behavior, viz. scotophase. This species is known to have an endogenous circadian oscillator entrained by light (Bailey and Lazaridou-Dimitriadou, 1986; Attia, 2004), and the circadian pattern of locomotor activity remains with a period of ~25 h in constant darkness for at least 20 days (Bailey and Lazaridou-Dimitriadou, 1986). The interpretation of the present results must take the influences of the light-dark cycle into consideration. Bion-M1 PF snails arrived at the lab in the evening, and the physiological recordings were mostly completed that night. The ST and NV control snails on the other hand were recorded during the daytime. If the statocyst contains a self-sustained peripheral circadian oscillator, it may affect the physiological responses we measured. To exclude such a possibility we performed an additional experiment that confirmed the statocyst response was independent of the circadian time in our preparation (Figure S5). However, the two Bion-M1 control groups with controlled dark conditions (DK and OL, 30 days in dark, recorded in scotophase) and the Foton-M3 control group (DK2007, 12 days in dark, recorded in daytime) show a decreased statocyst response in comparison to ST (natural light cycle, ~16L:8D) and NV (12:12 h LD cycle) control groups (see Figures 7, 8). Despite housed in the dark during the missions, Bion-M1 PF and PF2007 snails showed an increased statoreceptor sensitivity to tilt stimuli, whether recorded at night or during the daytime. This increase sensitivity found only in PF snails was presumably the result of the space environment and not from influences of the housing or time of recording. How these external factors interact to shape the statocyst response is unclear, as well as whether or not the interaction occurs at the same site of plasticity. Another route through which the light-dark cycle might modulate the statocyst activity is via the vestibular efferent fibers (Williamson, 1986; Janse et al., 1988; Tsubata et al., 2003; Sakakibara et al., 2005), that may be entrained by a central circadian oscillator (Attia, 2004). We compared the peri-stimulus curves of efferent activity and found no significant difference between PF and control snails (see Figure 10), thereby excluding the efferent neurons of dynamically modulating the statocyst response on a tilt-by-tilt basis. Whether the substrate for an effect of light-dark cycle is within the statocyst itself or elsewhere remains to be determined. Inertial mass as adaptation mechanism A widely discussed mechanism of adaptation to the μG environment is an adjustment of the weight of statoconia (invertebrates) or otoconia (vertebrates) (Wiederhold et al., 2000; Edelmann, 2002; Gorgiladze, 2002). Deposition of calcium carbonate will affect a change in the mass, but not the weight, in space, but would reveal itself after return to the normal gravity. Ultrastructural studies in Helix found statoconia growth, i.e., size and amount, after long-term exposures to μG on Mir and ISS space stations (Gorgiladze, 2002; Gorgiladze et al., 2011). In Gorgiladze's (2002) study, statoconia size increased with μG exposures between 40 and 148 days, but for shorter exposures the data less clear as the statoconia size after 14 days was larger than after 31 days. Statoconia growth was reversed after return to 1G in about 30 days. In their postflight snails the statoconia were often incrustated by “flakes” or covered by a layer of distinctive crust indicating a deposition of calcium carbonate. Our limited morphological data from Bion-M1 postflight statoconia did not show any of these characteristic features (see Figure 4). However, caution is needed because our sample size was restricted to a single animal in 3 groups and the flight durations were not similar. This compensatory process requires more examination. One more factor is pertinent to the different results reported in Helix studies: in our study adult animals (20–25 g) were used, whereas in the previous studies snails were either juvenile (0.3–2 g) or young adults (9–15 g). The effect of statoconia growth in μG was more pronounced in young snails (Gorgiladze, 2002), and was insignificant in adult fish otoconia (Wiederhold et al., 2003). In addition, our physiological data showed no difference in the magnitude of the sensitivity changes between the postflight groups of our separate missions having different duration of μG exposure (shown in Figure 8). Thus, there is no substantive evidence for a mechanism inducing a change in statoconia mass for snails exposed to μG for less than a month. For the process of readaptation to normal gravity, postflight groups of Bion-M1 and Foton-M3 studies both divided into two distinct subgroups by the critical time of recording 20 h after landing. It is even less likely that changes in statoconia play any role in this readaptation process of such short duration. Taking into account 20 h as critical time of readaptation, neural plasticity of statocyst sensory statoreceptors themselves, central circuits, or both might be better candidates. Role of efferent vestibular neurons The vertebrate inner ear sensory organs receive centripetal innervation of their hair cells (and the dendrites of afferent neurons) by centrally located efferent neurons. This strategy is also present in snail statocyst: the statocyst nerve contains the axons of the statoreceptors as well as axons of neurons from the cerebral ganglion on each side. How the efferent neurons influence the gravity and acceleration sensations during and after space flight is unknown. Assuming the efferent innervation serves to tune the receptor's response to acceleration in a behaviorally relevant context (Goldberg et al., 2002; Boyle et al., 2009; Rabbitt et al., 2010), μG might trigger a shut down of the efferent system to allow an amplification of any input, now weak or absent, signal. If so, this might temporarily lead to a hypersensitivity in snail statoreceptors. In an attempt to address this key issue, we analyzed the firing behavior of presumed efferent neurons to tilt and found it was monotonous within each examined group of snails. Thus, direct evidence that the efferents play a role in the postflight statoreceptor hypersensitivity was not found. We cannot rule out however that the efferent neurons were studied in a behaviorally irrelevant context, namely in the isolated neural preparation and not in the intact animal, and postflight but not inflight. Directionality of response and single unit analysis Previously we reported (Balaban et al., 2011) that the differential sensitivity of statocyst responses to stimuli of different directions (c1 > c2, c3, c4) seen in control snails was lost in the Foton-M3 postflight snails, and we hypothesized a weakening of directional selectivity might occur immediately after spaceflight. Here, we replicated this finding in the Bion-M1 control groups, but the PF snails of Bion-M1 remained spatial tuned to preferred directions (Figures S8, S9). Because of the robustness of the new results we reject our earlier hypothesis that spaceflight influences directional selectivity. Directional selectivity was also maintained in vertebrate otolith afferents with hypersensitivity after spaceflight (Boyle et al., 2001) and in centrifuged snails having reduced overall tilt sensitivity (Popova and Boyle, 2015). We consider this spatial tuning as a fundamental property of statocyst function and not readily susceptible to plastic changes. By spike sorting of the statocyst nerve activity we were able to distinguish the activity of single sensory cells. In some cases the cell activity could identify its possible location in the statocyst, like ventrally located ciliary cells or frontally from caudally located cells. We tried in all cases to find the directionality at the single unit level, but the most active cells in our records frequently showed little to no direction tuning to tilt presented in our protocol; these cells are presumably ventrally located in the statocyst and code more the position of animal in space than stimulus direction (see Figure 11). In the nudibranch Hermissenda the 13 statocyst sensory cells have cilia organized for multidirectional sensitivity (Kuzirian et al., 1981). In Helix some statocyst sensory cells might share a form of this organization in functional terms. Using single unit analysis we identified a few sensory cells that responded to only one of the two tested directions of tilt with a phasic-tonic reaction (see Figure 12). If we consider this to represent a multidirectional sensitivity of a statoreceptor, this type of response might be constructed in frontally and caudally located statoreceptors by a physical contact only with the edge of the inertial mass in the horizontal position of statocyst. Activity of these cells allows the CNS to decode the direction of stimuli from the statocyst output. Comparing the activity of identified statoreceptors, position-coding ventrally located cells form between 50 and 80% of the statocyst output (for OL: ~20 spikes/s, for PF-e: ~30 spikes/s during tilt), and direction-coding cells contribute ~15% of the net response. The only viable candidate to explain the existence of directional response with higher sensitivity (“head down,” c1) is the unpaired sensory neuron at the anterior pole of the statocyst (see Figure 13). Responding to perturbations of vertical orientation of the organism, including human, in the “head down” direction are of critical importance for self-protection, and the unpaired sensory neuron at the anterior pole of the statocyst adds to the net information signal of tilt stimuli in this biologically meaningful direction. Marine mollusks require a fast and reliable recognition of spatial orientation from variable external cues to maintain proper balance and 3D navigation in the sea, and thus their statocyst is the most studied among invertebrates (Wood and Von Baumgarten, 1972; Alkon, 1975; Janse, 1983; Budelmann and Williamson, 1994; Deliagina et al., 1998). In freshwater species, pulmonate Lymnaea, the statocyst output is important for periodical trips to the surface for breathing (Janse, 1982). Janse et al. (1988) compared the statoreceptors firing rate and gain in marine Aplysia and freshwater Lymnaea and speculated that the difference in ecology of the animals leads to a more sensitive statocyst in Aplysia. For land snails vestibular function is important for gravitaxis reaction, when the animals climb to elevated positions for diurnal rest in hot and dry day-time, and when returning back to the soil at dusk (Cowie, 1985; Aubry et al., 2006; Di Lellis et al., 2012). Another obvious biological significance of statocyst function is its role in the withdrawal reaction, as a sudden change of the body position may preclude an attack of a predator. In agreement with ecology of land snails, our physiological data show that the Helix statocyst operates more for coding the orientation of animal's body than fast changes in its direction.",

Copyright notice ID: 5672023 PMID: 29163058 Abstract The vestibular system receives a permanent influence from gravity and reflexively controls equilibrium. If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored. Keywords: mollusks, gravity sensing, statocyst, neuroplasticity, vestibular system, gravitaxisIntroduction Vertebrates and invertebrates sense inertial acceleration and a change in orientation with respect to gravity by mechanoreceptors in the otolith and statolith organs, respectively. The force of gravity is constantly present on Earth and forms the frame of reference for spatial orientation. Inertial accelerations occur within this gravity frame of reference naturally during self-generated movements or those imparted externally onto the organism by perturbations, such as a slippery surface or a deflected leaf. Kreidl (1893) demonstrated in a clever manner that the statocyst is a mechanosensitive organ. As a crayfish molts, it leaves behind the statolith and must manually re-seed its statocyst with a new, typically sand, weight-lending mass. Kreidl replaced the sand with reduced ferrous oxide and manipulated the crayfish's posture using a magnet, thereby simulating the action of the normal gravitational field with a magnetic one. Despite the simplicity of the gastropod organ of balance, there are many functional similarities between the snail's statocyst and the more highly evolved otolith organs of vertebrate species (Popova and Boyle, 2015). Statoreceptors, like hair cells in the vertebrate utricle and saccule, are mechanoreceptors that depend on a weight-lending mass to provide a shearing deformation of the underlying ciliary processes to sense position and acceleration with respect to gravity. The mechanoreceptors provide the neural code to the reflex mechanisms that control balance and equilibrium and restore the organism to its appropriate posture and orientation. The first vertebrate ear was in essence a graviceptive statocyst (Budelmann, 1988), and only later in evolution did angular acceleration sensation appear as the animal increased its locomotor mobility and developed a flexible neck (Straka et al., 2014). In vertebrates the vestibular-induced compensatory action is both tonic and dynamic and distributed mainly to the motor circuits controlling the extensor, or antigravity, muscles (Wilson and Jones, 1979). In the absence of gravity and thus an opposing force, even as brief as 5–11 days, astronauts lose about 20% muscle mass (Fitts et al., 2001; Demontis et al., 2017). The changes observed on the skeletomotor system by spaceflight are largely predicted by the mechanical unloading of the body mass: a large skeletal frame to manage muscle contractions about joints is no longer needed and muscle atrophy and osteopenia occur. This same causality might predict a comparable deterioration of vestibular mechanosensory function by space flight: no signal and thus no gain in the system. Surprisingly, despite the permanence of gravity during the evolutionary courses of vertebrates and invertebrates in an otherwise changing environment, the mechanosensory structures do not progressively degenerate, at least not in the short term. Extraordinarily challenging recordings taken during spaceflight from bullfrog otolith afferents by Bracchi et al. (1975) and Gualtierotti (1977) and vestibular neurons and ocular gaze in alert monkeys by Kozlovskaya and her colleagues (reviewed in Cohen et al., 2005) were interpreted as showing an increased sensitivity in measured responses, at least in the early periods of the missions. Otolith afferents in the teleost toadfish exhibited a profound hypersensitivity when tested to inertial accelerations upon return to Earth which recovered back to normal after several days (Boyle et al., 2001). A more recent study in astronauts exposed to long-term space missions aboard the International Space Station have shown a deceased otolith-mediated responses elicited by centrifugation after 6 months of spaceflight which also fully recovered within ~9 days after return (Hallgren et al., 2016). The results in vertebrates exposed to space missions indicate the importance of the duration of exposure to space and the time frame in which measures are taken. On Earth the orientation of the gravitational acceleration defines the vertical, and although the gravitational vertical is lost in space, the astronaut uses other cues, such as vision to perceive an “up” orientation (Clément et al., 2007). The land snail Helix lucorum Linnaeus (Pulmonata, Gastropoda) also orients to the vertical using its bilateral statocysts and visual receptors, and can actually move against the force of gravity using a sticky excretion. We selected the land snail for a month-long study on an unmanned orbiting satellite for many reasons, such as their small size permitting a sufficient sample size given our volume limit, snails are hardy and can remain metabolically active under confined conditions for the duration of the mission, snails do not require elaborate life support systems, recordings can be made directly from the sensory receptors themselves (Balaban et al., 2011; Popova and Boyle, 2015), and importantly certain snail behaviors and their underlying cellular circuits are well described (Balaban, 2002). In the present study snails spent 30 days under conditions of weightlessness and darkness, thereby removing its normal cues of the vertical. Under return to Earth the postflight snails were compared to four separate control groups to identify the adaptive changes at the behavioral, structural, molecular, and neurophysiological levels. Based on the present results we also recalculated our previous Foton-M3 data to confirm the findings in separate missions and establish a time course of response readaptation or recovery of function after a spaceflight.Materials and methods Creating persistent conditions for microgravity The 2013 Bion-M1 space project was a 30-day orbital research mission operated by the Russian Academy of Sciences, launched on 19th of April (2013) from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, and landed on 19th of May near Orenburg, Russia. The satellite was pressurized and contained full life support systems to maintain safe temperature, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels for a wide variety of species. The satellite is under Earth's gravitational pull and is in a state of free fall or microgravity (μG), and thus the objects within the satellite appear to be weightless. Upon return to Earth, the snails were airlifted from the landing site by helicopter to the Orenburg airport, flown by airplane to Moscow, and transported by van to the laboratory, arriving within 13 h after landing.Snail populations Experimental procedures were in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health, and the Ethical Committee of the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology of Russian Academy of Sciences approved the protocol. Land snails, Helix lucorum L., served as experimental subjects in this study. Snails were collected in vineyards of Crimea, kept in terraria, and fed on cabbage leaves in humid air conditions to prevent aestivation (a prolonged rest in hot and dry periods where the snail covers its shell opening with a special secretion). Experimental animals were assigned to 5 separate groups based on experimental condition (see Table 1). The prime group was the population of postflight snails (PF, n = 15) exposed to μG for 30 days on the Bion-M1 orbital satellite. PF snails were housed in the dark during the mission and thus no orientation cues from a light source were available. Four ground-based asynchronous groups were designed for comparison to the PF snails. A Naïve group (NV, n = 15) of snails survived for 30 days under normal conditions (Light:Dark cycle was 12:12 and water and food were available ad libitum) in a lab terrarium having large spatial dimensions. A Starvation group (ST, n = 17) survived for 30 days at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IMBP, Moscow) facilities as asynchronous control subjects under conditions more closely similar to the PF group, such as a congested habitat, no food or water except a bottom layer of wet paper, a fixed temperature, but a normal light/dark cycle. The third control consisted of snails also mimicking the PF group: a 30-day survival in a flight habitat under comparable conditions, but in the dark (DK group, n = 20). Lastly, last group was DK snails exposed to an applied short (2 s) duration 10G acceleration; although this stimulus does not simulate all of the parameters of landing of the Bion-M1 satellite upon its return to Earth, it does present a paradigm of an abrupt transition from a lower gravity level to a higher one. We termed this group a gravity overloading (OL, n = 21). Weight-controlled snails of this OL group lived in conditions designed to resemble the PF group except the 30-day exposure to μG. After 30 days of the mock flight the OL snails were centrifuged in individual counterbalanced containers using a Beckman Allegra X-15R (220 RPM, container radius 19.2 cm, 2 s on 10G in manual mode with slowest possible acceleration speed). This procedure neither stopped the crawling behavior of snails nor harmed them in any way by visual observation. Centrifugation of OL snails was performed at the same time of day as the Bion-M1 landing, followed by a 12-h delay of the behavioral experiments, to mimic the conditions and same circadian time as the PF group.

Sample number (N=) is given for the total number within each group, and where appropriate the snails are partitioned into either a small body weight or large body weight (parentheses). Pluses correspond to the conditions given in the leftmost column in which the snails in each group are subjected.Behavioral studies Gravitaxis reaction to a 90° head down pitch from horizontal was tested in a previously described apparatus (Balaban et al., 2011) following the same protocol, and full course of this stereotypical behavior was recorded for later analysis using a general purpose digital camera at 30 fps. To provide a double blind control analysis the filenames of the PF, ST, and NV groups were encrypted. Three of the authors (M. R., T. K., and A. Z.) independently split video timelines for each snail to fit the gravitaxis phases as described in the previous report (Balaban et al., 2011). The three analyzers then met, reevaluated their tables of latencies, and made screenshots for every phase of each snail's response. A difference in response latencies of >5 s between the 3 datasets was found in about 3% of measures, thereby triggering a discussion of the merits of each measure until the best measure was determined. The other 2 experimental groups, DK and OL, were investigated roughly a year later and a double blind procedure was deemed not pertinent in this case. Tentacle withdrawal reaction was measured as the length of each tentacle, first in pixels using ImageJ and then calculated and analyzed as a percentage of full tentacle length (corresponding to T0 phase of gravitaxis response). The angle in degrees between tentacles was measured in ImageJ for every phase of gravitaxis. Accuracy of ImageJ measurements from screenshots was evaluated by mean difference between results of 3 researchers (N. A., A. V., and Y. P.), and the data for 3 randomly chosen animals from PF group and 3 from any of control groups were used. For tentacle length it was 6% error of absolute values, and 4% for inter-tentacle angle measurement. All time parameters were measured with accuracy of 1 s by record timeline on screenshots.SEM of inertial mass Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis was made on statocysts from three groups of snails. The statocysts were extracted after the experimental session, frozen dry and stored at −80°C. Before SEM imaging statocysts were fixed by cold absolute ethanol for 12 h, rinsed in distilled water, and placed onto carbon tape in a drop of water. The statocyst was dissected under a dissecting microscope to visualize the inertial mass using fine neurosurgery forceps. After removal of overlying structures, the statoconia preparations were left for few minutes to desiccate. The prepared samples were then placed on carbon tape for SEM and put horizontally on the stage of the microscope (EVO LS10, Carl Zeiss, Germany) for backscattered electrons (BSE) imaging under low vacuum (50–70 Pa) and accelerating voltage of 22 kV (LaB6 cathode). Digital images were captured in tiff format with resolution 3,024 × 2,406 pixels.Total RNA preparation and cDNA library construction for NGS Statocysts of two groups, PF-e and ST (n = 4 + 4), were frozen −80°C in microRNA buffer for sequencing. Cellular RNA from statocyst samples was prepared by the guanidine thiocyanate method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987). RNA for cDNA synthesis was treated with DNaseI (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) for 30 min at 37°C followed by phenol: chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA samples were analyzed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to confirm RNA isolation purity and absence of RNA degradation. The peak of 28S rRNA is invisible in some species of snails because their 28S rRNA consists of two separate pieces held together by ribosome proteins, and after purification each half of 28S rRNA has the same length as 18S rRNA, so 28S peak merges with 18S peak. According to this, we checked only 18S peak integrity to estimate total RNA quality. Reverse transcription of RNA samples was performed using oligo-dT(M1) primer and SuperScript® III Enzyme Mix, and second strand of cDNA was created with Mint cDNA synthesis kit (Evrogen). Then we amplified cDNA samples for 27 cycles in the T100 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) with universal primer M1. Concentration of amplified cDNA was measured using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. cDNA libraries were then prepared using Ion Plus Fragment library Kit (Ion Torrent, Life Technologies) following manufacturer's protocols. cDNA libraries were purified using Magnetic Bead Cleanup Module (Ion Torrent, Life Technologies). The quality of each prepared cDNA library was evaluated using Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (with Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (with High Sensitivity DNA chip and Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit). In our samples, the amount of short cDNA fragments with length of 25–160 bp did not exceed 10%. During the next step, clonal amplification was performed using Ion PI™ Template OT2 200 Kit v3 and Ion OneTouch™ 2 system (Life Technologies) in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. After amplification, the samples were centrifuged, and precipitates were resuspended in bidistilled water and stored at +4°C for 14–18 h. Sequencing was performed using Ion PI™ Sequencing 200 Kit v3 and Ion PI™ Chip v2 on Ion Proton™ sequencer. One chip contained four libraries tagged with different barcodes.Transcriptome analysis of statocysts First we made de novo assembly of H. lucorum statocyst transcriptome using the TRINITY v.2.4.0 (32 G memory, 60 threads, min_contig_length = 200), SPAdes v.3.10.0 (-iontorrent flag, 60 threads) and Velvet/Oases (v.1.2.10, optimal k-mer length was estimated by brute-force method and equal 111, -scaffolding and -read_trkg flags was enabled) programs for assembling transcriptome. For assessment programs quality, we have computed for each program N50 values and maximal transcript length (TRINITY N50—321 Maximal Trans. Len.—2,545 bp; SPAdes N50—558 Maximal Trans. Len.—4,813 bp; Oases N50—453 Maximal Trans. Len.—1,262 bp). Next, all assemblies were merged to one FASTA-file. Transcripts from this file were clustered by homology level. Two transcripts have one cluster, if the homology level is more than 90%. The clustering was accomplished by CD-HIT v.4.6 program. Totally from four different assembles were formed 66355 clusters. After clustering, the longest transcripts were extracted from each cluster and wrote into new multi-FASTA file. 1788966 sequences in final assemble were obtained. For each sequence in this assembly was found open reading frame by Transdecoder. The quality of this combined assembly was estimated by BUSCO v. 2.0.1 program. It computes the percent of correctly assembled orthology genes in the input file. Our combined assembly gave 50% correct orthology genes. For better quality we added an earlier obtained Helix neural transcriptome assembly. This “multimerged” assembly gave 95.5% correct orthology genes. After obtaining the transcriptome reference, we must obtain expression genes level and distinguish important genes. First, we aligned with BWA MEM v. 0.7.5a-r405 each sample to our assembly-reference. Another aligner software (bowtie, bowtie2, tophat) showed worse results (approximately 70% of aligned reads) and wasn't used for further transcriptome analisys. The averaged percent of aligned reads were 93.7% (minimum −91.07%, maximum −95.47% reads). Next, we computed FPKM values for ST group (“control” samples) and PF-e group (“experiment” samples) by CuffDiff software and selected significant differential expressed genes (3546 genes with p < 0.05).Electrophysiological studies After the behavioral test was concluded (starting at 14–15 h after landing), the snail was anesthetized by injection of ice-cold isotonic MgCl2 solution (~15% of body weight) and its nervous system was isolated and prepared for electrophysiological studies of the statocyst response to tilt mimicking the “head down” and the “tail down” behavioral conditions. The whole nerve recording techniques from the statocyst nerve, n. vestibularis, were made during the time window of 15–26 h after landing. The experimental design and data analysis were conducted in a comparable fashion to our previous Foton-M3 study (Balaban et al., 2011). In brief, the central ganglionic ring was dissected free from the anesthetized animal and pinned to a silicone-elastomer (Sylgard)-coated dish. The vestibular nerve was identified, its surrounding connective tissue was removed, and it was placed across a Vaseline bridge that isolated the nerve in one chamber from the nerve, statocyst, and surrounding pedal ganglion in the other chamber. Each chamber contained a saline solution, a Ag/AgCl wire, and the signals from the vestibular nerve were differentially amplified and recorded. The reflex arc from the statocyst nerve to command neurons of the defensive behavior was tested using conventional intracellular recordings in combination with nerve stimulation, single pulse 3 ms width, 0.8–2.1 V, using the isolated stimulation head. We used the spike sorting by template interactive script provided in Spike2 v.7 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK) for the single unit analysis. Each record was imported to Spike2 and the cursors selected the key impulse epochs in time with the help of auxiliary channel displaying the movement of the platform. Spike templates were typically made from the first run through the record, and by the second run all the spikes were sorted. First and second principal components were used to visualize clouds of single units. These clouds of single units were checked with PCA to not intersect. Usually default parameters and time window of spike length work well and generate 5–13 additional channels of single unit activity.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was done in R software using custom written scripts for exploratory statistics and one-way comparison of multiple groups. We performed automated analysis of all data by R Markdown script, which generated statistical reports in doc format, where different statistical approaches were used to the same data. The script, raw data, and statistical reports are uploaded to Open Science Framework platform to make maximal amount of scientific data open (https://osf.io/v5brf/). For the behavioral part of this study we report results of Kruskal-Wallis test (KW) to find the difference between the 5 groups as a default method, because homogeneity of variances assumption mostly fails on our unfiltered data. Dunn's procedure for post-hoc pairwise tests against the PF group was used, and the reported p-values are after Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons (DBH). Alpha 0.05 was accepted as level of significance by default, but exact p-values are mostly reported here. Supplementary materials at Open Science Framework contain additional classical statistical inference also as a result of the randomization methods (Bayesian probability and 95% confidence intervals, PERMANOVA) and robust tools (ANOVA on 20% trimmed means and analysis of datasets with Tukey's outliers filtered out), allowing comprehensive analysis of the data. Correlation analysis is provided as Spearman's rank statistics, and correlation matrices were visualized by corrplot R package.Results Early phases of gravitaxis reaction When the platform upon which the snail is attached is suddenly pitched from horizontal to vertical, the snail displays a fear-like reaction by fully or partially withdrawing its tentacles (designed phase 0; Figure 1A). This reaction (latency of withdrawal is <1 s) is believed mediated by the gravi-sensing statocyst organ, the snail's equivalent to a vertebrate's vestibular otolith organ. Therefore, the differences in magnitude and time (duration) of the resulting tentacle elongation phase likely reveal changes in reaction of the snail's statocyst. We define the phase of fast elongation of tentacles before the snail starts to turn its body as the T0 phase of gravitaxis (Figure 1A). Our previous report (Balaban et al., 2011) did not follow this convention, and thus the behavior seen in phase T0 of Figure 2A does not correctly align with our current convention because the length of tentacles were not fully extended. At the end of T0 phase the rapid tentacle elongation is complete and the black eyes on their tips are clearly recognizable in most of the records, both of which occur before the head actually starts to move. Snails often start turning to T1 phase immediately after some amount of “hesitation” or scanning the space around them by moving the head from side to side. There was no significant difference between groups in the count of scanning movements (p = 0.114 by Fisher's Exact Test with Monte-Carlo simulated p-value based on 99999 replicates); 82 of 88 (93%) snails of all groups turned the body to position the head above the shell in T2 phase.

(D) Tentacles length during all gravitaxis phases, normalized for T1 = 100%.Temporal parameters (latencies and durations) of gravitaxis phases The dynamics of gravitaxis behavior are shown in Figure 1. A comparison of phase T0 duration between the postflight (PF) to the four control groups reveals statistically significant shortening (panel C) of T0 in PF snails (KW p < 0.006, DBH p adj max = 0.011 for PF-OL comparison; mean ± 95% CI). Due to the nature of this measured parameter, there are few extreme outliers in the dataset (q.v. Supplementary Materials). Robust methods are recommended to deal with such samples to improve the power of statistics, and indeed they return p ≤ 0.001 in KW and DBH tests, thereby providing strong support for a shorter phase T0 in PF than in the other four control groups of snails. No statistical differences of T0 latency were found between the four control groups, even with the application of powerful randomization methods on filtered datasets. A comparison of phase T1 latency between PF to the four control groups shows no statistically significant difference between them (KW p = 0.195). There are few outliers in the dataset, so we applied robust statistics as well, which resulted only in marginal significance (KW p = 0.039, DBH padj = 0.01 for PF-ST only). A similar result was found with T1 duration (T1 latency–T0 latency), with an insignificant difference between groups (KW p = 0.106) in unfiltered dataset and significant for only two control groups if Tukey's outliers were filtered out (KW p = 0.02, DBH padj = 0.003 for PF-ST and padj = 0.023 for PF-DK). With respect to phase T2 latency a similar result was observed. The comparison of this phase between PF to the four control groups again showed no statistically significant difference between them (KW p = 0.223). There are a few outliers in the dataset, so we used robust statistics here as well, which resulted in only marginal significance (KW p = 0.046, DBH reveals no significant padj-values). No significant differences for T2 duration, and also for the later phases T3 and T4 latency and duration, were found or at best a marginal one between two groups in comparison only (q.v. Supplementary Materials for details).Tentacles withdrawal during gravitaxis reaction Changes of tentacle length during the gravitaxis behavior are shown in Figure 2A. No significant asymmetry in tentacle withdrawal reaction was found in any group (p = 0.483, dependent t-test), and thus data for left and right tentacles were averaged. A comparison of phase 0 tentacle withdrawal reaction (Figure 2B) of the four control groups to the PF group reveals that PF snails are retracting their tentacles to a lesser degree than the snails in each control group (KW p = 0.009, DBH padj < 0.035 for 3 of 4 control groups, and insignificant padj = 0.1 for PF-ST comparison). The later dynamics of the tentacle lengths show more complicated differences between the groups. After a relatively fast elongation of the tentacles during phase T0 (8–15 s), the snails in all groups slowly elongated their tentacles ~10–30% more during T1 phase (Figure 2A). After phase T1 tentacle length reached a plateau in all control groups, with a higher length seen in OL snails than in the NV, ST, and DK snails (insignificantly during T1-T2, at tendency level (p < 0.1) at T3, and significantly for T4 (against all groups including PF: KW p = 0.02, DBH padj max = 0.049; Figure 2C). The tentacle length of PF snails during the late gravitaxis phases showed different dynamics (Figure 2A). At T1 it reached a maximum (~130% of T0, close to OL group value), and then gradually declined over time to ~T0 length at the end of T4 phase. The same data in Figure 2A are normalized in Figure 2D for tentacle length at phase T1 as 100%, but the procedure did not change the direction of observed effects.Inter-tentacle angle during gravitaxis reaction The dynamics of the angle between tentacles was measured in certain phases of gravitaxis reaction and are shown in Figure S1A. No significant differences between groups were found except the delta angle (T0-0) difference, which is significant for PF-NV and OL-NV comparisons (KW p = 0.013, DBH padj = 0.029 and padj = 0.019; Figure S1B). More powerful statistical methods were applied but failed to reveal any additional differences among the snail groups (q. v. Supplementary Materials).Correlation analysis of gravitaxis reaction A correlation analysis was made between the merged datasets of the four control groups and the PF dataset (Figure 3). Phase T1-T4 latencies and durations are positively correlated among themselves in both PF and joined control group of snails, as well as tentacle length, and, to a lesser amount, the inter-tentacle angles. In the PF group correlations between inter-tentacle angles of early and late phases is higher than in controls. Delta (T0-0) inter-tentacle angle is weakly positively correlated with tentacle length in controls but not in the PF group. In PF group delta (T0-0) is correlated with latency, but no such a correlation was seen in the merged control. As expected, the number of head scanning movements is positively correlated with latency for all phases. In control dataset tentacle lengths show weak negative correlations with temporal parameters (most pronounced and significant for T0 latency and length, Figure 3A). For the PF group no such a correlation was found (Figure 3B). Latencies and inter-tentacle angles show weak negative correlations in both PF and control groups. In PF group tentacle lengths show weak positive correlations with inter-tentacle angle (although insignificant with the sample size used), in contrast to control dataset showing no such correlation. Positive correlation of snail weight with duration of “ascending” phases T2 and T3 is more pronounced in PF group then in control, also as negative correlation with duration of T1. Figure 3.

Cells with bold borders are significant (p < 0.05), below main diagonal the Spearman's rho values are shown.Foton-M3 behavioral data reanalysis The behavioral data from a 2007 Foton-M3 12-day orbital satellite mission were analyzed before for latency of gravitaxis phases (Balaban et al., 2011), but the small sample size did not allow us to make any statistically supported conclusions. The design of Foton-M3 experiment was slightly different: gravitaxis responses only up to phase T2 were recorded, and the same preflight snails were used as control group. Here we reanalyze the Foton-M3 behavioral records following the same workflow as Bion-M1 data to test the confidence of our main findings (Figure S2). The latency of T0 phase of Foton-M3 postflight group had a tendency to be shorter than in their preflight control measures (median 9.5 vs. 12.5 s, n = 10, p = 0.112 in dependent t-test). Tentacle withdrawal reaction in postflight group of snails was weaker than in the same snails in preflight tests (median 60.45 vs. 34% of T0 length, p = 0.002 in dependent t-test), and showed no difference with the control in late phases (Figure S2B). Differences in the inter-tentacle angles in Foton-M3 data (Figure S2C) are close to significance level: for postflight group phase 0 and T0 angles were smaller, than for preflight control (p = 0.025 and p = 0.067 correspondingly in dependent t-test); the delta (T0-0) angle was higher in postflight group (p = 0.051 in dependent t-test). Conclusively, Foton-M3 data reanalysis revealed the differences in postflight 2007 group in the same direction as in Bion-M1 postflight group.Statoconia structure The surface structure of the statoconia mass from groups PF, OL and ST was imaged by SEM to examine the role of possible statoconia growth after 30-day exposure to μG conditions (Figure 4). Although the sample size is small (one statocyst in each group), no crustations or “flake-like” structures were observed in the statoconia of the PF sample that might indicate a deposition of calcium carbonate; no differences were found in either statoconia shape or surface structure between groups. The statoconia areas were calculated from SEM images in ImageJ ROI manager, and a tracing tool with minimal manual correction selected each region. No significant difference was found between groups (μm2, PF: 218.9 ± 12.24, OL: 196.6 ± 12.59, ST: 235.5 ± 14.8, n. s. padj ≥ 0.43 in DBH pairwise comparisons against PF group). Figure 4.

Columns represent statoconia preparations from different groups: (A,D), PF group; (B,E), OL group; (C,F), ST group.Transcriptome analysis of statocysts We allocated 3,544 transcripts with a significant difference between FPKM values in the control (ST) and experiment (PF-e) groups. These transcripts were annotated by BLAST homology finding. NP database was used for alignment. There were 2,288 proteins annotated. It is useful to note that many transcripts have similar annotation. For example, Cd-specific metallothionein gene was found 373 times. Possible explanations may be a clustering of similar genes or a very aggressive PCR. Fifty of the most significant differential expression genes (p < 0.05) are listed in Table S1 and the most interesting of them are shown on the heatmap diagram of Figure 5. Among the most significant differentially expressed genes are the neuronal specific precursors of neuropeptides, neurotransmitter receptor subunits, and other genes involved in cell signaling. This result of transcriptome analysis unambiguously identified the statocyst itself as the site of neural plasticity during the process of readaptation to normal gravity after spaceflight. Raw data were deposited at  Bioproject, accession number PRJNA400816. Figure 5.

Brief and weak electric shocks, delivered to statocyst nerve, exert an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or triggers an action potential in Pa2 and Pa28 neurons (Figure 6). The EPSP shape and its latency suggest a polysynaptic mechanism via unidentified interneurons. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Command neurons of defensive behavior receive excitatory input from vestibular nerve. (A) Single shock 3 ms, 0.68 V; (B) single shock 3 ms, 1.5 V. Stimulation of n. vestibularis exerts EPSP (A) or an action potential (B) in ipsi- and contralateral command neurons for defensive behavior.Background statocyst activity In Bion-M1 postflight and the four control groups we recorded background statocyst activity and induced responses to tilts in different directions. Background firing rate in preparations of different groups was not statistically different, although OL and especially DK preparations had increased level of background activity (spikes per second, PF: 6.46 ± 0.7, OL: 8.14 ± 0.89, DK: 10.25 ± 1.0, ST: 6.6 ± 0.55, NV: 6.94 ± 1.1; DBH all against PF n. s., minimal padj = 0.072 for PF-DK comparison, more statistics are available as Supplementary Materials).Electrophysiological studies: technical controls Many factors can affect the recorded responses of statocysts, and thus we attempted to control as many of them as possible to reveal the effect of microgravity exposure on the vestibular system. Short-term plasticity (habituation or sensitization) during an experiment can affect neural responses, so our protocol controlled it by a fixed inter-stimulus interval and a fixed sequence of stimuli, where the first four tilts were excluded from the analysis. Additional experiments were made to study the stability of nerve responses to a long sequence of stimuli (exhaustive control, Figure S3), and to a sequence with a reversed order of stimuli (Figure S4). There is also the possibility of long-term circadian changes of responses, as it was shown for the snail lip sensory nerve (Voss et al., 1997); this factor might influence the results because the recordings of PF snails commenced after their arrival to the lab at night. To exclude such a possibility we provide additional experiments with our isolated CNS-statocysts preparations (Figure S5). Results of these technical controls allow us to analyze the data acquired by the main protocol.Postflight increase of statocyst response to vestibular stimulation Averaged statocyst responses to stimuli for all groups are shown in Figure 7. The number of spikes in the range (1.4–3.2) s in response to head-down tilt (c1) is significantly greater in PF snails than that in other snails (PF: 80.4 ± 4.44, OL: 52.58 ± 3.42, DK: 61.85 ± 4.55, ST: 68.68 ± 3.26, NV: 65.21 ± 5.05; DBH all against PF padj ≤ 0.026 after removing of 3 outliers in ST group). The number of spikes in the range (1.7–2.0) s in response to tilt in direction tail down (c3) is significantly more in group PF than in other groups (PF: 18.3 ± 1.24, OL: 13.05 ± 0.83, DK: 14.31 ± 1.47, ST: 13.88 ± 0.96, NV: 14.29 ± 0.87; DBH all against PF padj ≤ 0.045). Both adjusted p-values are close to marginal value, so these results must be viewed with caution. Control groups show no homogeneity: preparations of two groups with more controlled factors, OL and DK, responded with smaller gain (number of spikes after the tilt, normalized to background firing rate) than preparations of NV and ST groups, Figures 7C,E (for c1 OL: 3.93 ± 0.3, DK: 3.56 ± 0.21, ST: 5.93 ± 0.6 NV: 5.82 ± 0.75, DBH padj ≤ 0.007).

(B,D), Peri-stimulus curves of averaged responses to stimuli in two opposite directions. (C,E), Cumulative curves of responses for the same stimuli, normalized to background firing rate. *p < 0.05.Adaptation to microgravity The 30-day exposure to μG conditions in the Bion-M1 mission, as well as the shorter 12-day duration of the Foton-M3 mission, significantly affected the responses of the PF snails. Postflight snails of both projects arrived at the lab at comparable times (first nerve recording ~14 h after landing), and the same protocol was used in all preparations. As a result we can compare neural responses to identical tilt stimuli in the two postflight groups to check the dependence of statocyst adaptation to μG on the duration of mission. Figure 8 shows the comparison of statocyst tilt responses to mission duration. No statistically significant difference in number of spikes between the two postflight groups was found in pairwise comparisons [to tilt 3,050 ms range (1.1–2.9) s PF: 70.15 ± 3.84 vs. PF2007: 72.5 ± 8.042, KW p = 0.72; for tilt 550 ms range (0.2–1.4) s PF: 52.59 ± 2.73 vs. PF2007: 54 ± 5.74, KW p = 0.8], suggesting the response adaptation to μG reaches a plateau at a time shorter than 12 days. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Comparison of Bion-M1 and Foton-M3 postflight groups reveals an independence of microgravity adaptation on mission duration. (A) Response to c1 stimulus with duration 3,050 ms. (B) Response to c1 stimulus with duration 550 ms. Filled symbols represent PF snails and open symbols the corresponding control snails (see legend box).Readaptation to normal gravity Once the satellite leaves orbit it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. At this point the organism experiences a hyper-gravity force until touchdown, about 45 min later. Readaptation likely begins during the re-entry phase and determines how quickly the organism recovers. The first and last nerve recordings of PF snails were made 14.75 and 26.13 h after landing, respectively. The PF snails were split into an early PF-e (<20 h after landing) and late PF-l (>20 h after landing) subgroups, and compared individually to the OL snails to reveal the process of readaptation of statocyst function. The statocyst response of PF-e subgroup was significantly larger than that of PF-l subgroup and most OL snails (Figure 9). Responses to tilt in the range (0.5–1.7) s were significantly larger in the two analyzed directions in PF-e subgroup (for c1 PF-e: 54.67 ± 4.16, PF-l: 36.75 ± 7.11, OL: 31 ± 2.13, DBH pairwise comparison against PF-e padj = 0.073 (n. s.—but padj = 0.03 with Tukey post-hoc test) for PF-l and padj = 0.002 for OL; for c3 (PF-e: 46.17 ± 3.64, PF-l: 29.75 ± 2.29, OL: 27.47 ± 1.89, DBH pairwise comparison against PF-e padj = 0.038 for PF-l and padj = 0.001 for OL). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Splitting PF group by the time of recordings after touchdown reveals the time course of the re-adaptation process.

(B,D), Cumulative curves of responses for the same stimuli, normalized to background firing rate. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.The readaptation process in two different missions was compared by similarly splitting the electrophysiological data of Foton-M3 by time of preparation recording at 20 h after landing. Only two preparations were recorded before this critical time, but the overall picture is very similar to that obtained from Bion-M1 dataset (Figure S6). Statistics for such a small sample may be not reliable, but the required confidence level was reached for difference between early and lately recorded PF2007 subgroups, also as with control DK2007 group [range (1.3–2.2) s pairwise comparison against PF2007-e: 54 ± 2 vs. 32 ± 4.9 PF2007-l, padj = 0.04, DK2007: 21.88 ± 3.11, padj = 0.003; Tukey post-hoc test].Activity of vestibular efferent neurons One of the possible mechanisms of the statocyst activity modulation is by tuning the sensory cells via the central vestibular efferent fibers synapsing onto the statoreceptors. We were able to distinguish the activity of statocyst efferent neurons in our n. vestibularis records by spike sorting of single units with inverted polarity of spikes (i.e., traveling in centrifugal direction to statocyst). A possible efferent role in vestibular modulation was examined by comparing peri-stimulus curves of efferent activity in the different groups of snails (Figure 10). Efferent activity was found only in part of the preparations in any group, and in every case it was monotonous firing with OFF-responses to bursts of statocyst activity. No significant difference in efferent activity between groups was found [KW p = 0.78 (−4.9 − −1.9) s; KW p = 0.14 (0.2–2.9) s]. Such a pattern of activity and the lack of a significant correlation of it between the groups suggest a likely negligible influence of vestibular efferents on the background and induced activity of statocyst in our preparations. We studied also the effect of light ON- and OFF-stimuli in semi-intact preparations with intact eyes and found no light effect on activity of statocyst efferents and sensory cells (Figure S7). Figure 10. Open in a new tab Single unit analysis of statocyst efferent firing rate.

Tilt duration is given by the gray bar at the bottom of each plot.Effect of tilt direction on statocyst response and single unit analysis Responses to tilt in the direction of head down to horizon position (c1) were larger than any other vestibular stimuli in preparations from all control groups and the PF group (see Figures S4, S8). The effect was more profound in the period immediately after the stimulus end (tonic response), and more obvious on cumulative plots (Figure S9). Experiments using a reversed order of stimuli (to control for conditioning) showed that there is some effect of the sequence (note the increased response to c4 direction on Figure S4); but even if the stimulus in c1 direction was presented last in the sequence, it generated the larger response of the statocyst. In μG conditions statoreceptors are “unloaded” in contrast to normal gravity, and thus have less contact with the weight-lending statoconia. If an adaptation process occurs, the increase in sensitivity of statoreceptors may be expected. We analyzed the tilt responses of whole nerve activity at single unit level, namely the presumed single statoreceptors in two snail groups, PF-e and OL. The activity of single statoreceptors may signify an activation (ON-responses) or inhibition (OFF-responses) to vestibular stimuli, and varying phasic or tonic behavior might enrich the responses. All possible combinations of activity pattern were found in our recordings (Figure S10). First we plotted the averaged responses to different stimuli for two single units with a maximal phasic response (in 5 s) to either stimulus c1 or c3 (Figure 11). These single units contributed ~30% of the overall background firing level in the statocyst nerve, but showed a very weak sensitivity to vestibular stimuli (ON- responses to any stimulus), suggesting they presumably represented ventrally located statoreceptors, (Figures 11A–C). No increased tonic activity to c1 stimulus was found in these single units, so it cannot be the substrate of directional sensitivity we had found in net responses. Background firing rate of single units in PF-e group is similar to the one in OL group, but the responses are significantly larger (KW p < 0.001), Figure 11D. Another analyzed single unit's pattern was characterized by low or no background firing rate in the horizontal position and phasic-tonic responses to vestibular stimuli in only one direction (Figure 12). By the direction of its sensitivity the response likely originated from a frontally located statoreceptors for direction c1 Figures 12A,C,D) and from a caudally located cells for c3 (Figure 12B). These statoreceptors also showed dramatic difference between OL and PF-e groups, and no increased tonic activity for c1 direction. From single unit analysis only one explanation remains for increased responses for direction c1, observed in all groups. As Helix statocyst contains 13 statoreceptors, the unpaired cell, located at the anterior pole of the statocyst, drives the increase in response to head down tilt (c1). This cell responds to c1 stimulus and does not respond to any other stimulus presented (Figure 13). Figure 11. Open in a new tab Single unit analysis of statocyst activity.

The neural gravity sensors that control normal balance and equilibrium are now forced to operate in a unique environment. The present experiments sought to identify the consequences of a 30-day orbital mission on the behavioral performance of snails challenged by a vestibular perturbation after return to normal 1G starting 14–15 h after landing. To account for possible environmental and habitat factors of unmanned spaceflights that can affect measured parameters of behavior other than those related to the state of weightlessness, we designed four control groups based on housing, food and water availability, and lighting, and included a landing-like simulation. In brief, we found that the behavioral phases most directly correlated with gravity sensation were the most affected by the vestibular perturbations tested as soon as the snails reached the laboratory after landing. To distinguish μG-affected parameters, we made multiple group analysis of variance comparisons for each variable (q.v. Supplementary Materials). It reveals significant changes in the early phase of gravitaxis reaction parameters in the postflight (PF) group: the degree of tentacles withdrawal at the initial phase 0 was smaller (Figure 2B), and followed by shorter latency of tentacles protraction (T0, Figure 1C). Both findings were replicated in the data from an earlier 12-day Foton-M3 mission (T0 latency at the tendency level, phase 0 withdrawal highly significant; Figure S2). After the snail pivots to the head-up position (late T3-T4 phases), the length of tentacles becomes shorter in the PF group in comparison to 3 control groups (Figure 2). At the same time in the fourth control group, termed statocyst-affected “overloading” (landing simulation, OL), the tentacle length at T4 is significantly higher than that of the PF snails or any control snail, a finding that promotes a speculation on the opposite effect of overloading (hypergravity) and unloading (μG) exposure on the functions controlled by snail statocysts. The cause of a lesser T2 latency in Foton-M3 postflight group in comparison to Bion-M1 PF group may be attributed to smaller snails used in Foton-M3 project (3–8 vs. 8–25 g, muscle mass/shell weight ratio is higher for young snails, allowing faster movements). We studied subgroups of young snails (3–8 g) in OL controls, but no correlation of T2 duration with weight was found (q.v. Supplementary Data). For the gravitaxis reaction, the snails affected by prolonged μG exposure show stronger correlations with snail weight than do control snails (Figure 3), thus suggesting a probable explanation of a shorter T2 phase in Foton-M3 postflight snails. Snails belonging to the same genus of Helix (H. aspersa), the common garden snail, were exposed to increased gravitation by centrifugation for 16 and 32 days and showed an increased latency or slowing of T3 phase of gravitaxis (Popova and Boyle, 2015). In the data of Bion-M1 project opposite effects in PF snails to the control snails were not seen. There is no consistency between the different Bion-M1 control groups in this parameter, although two groups with most controlled conditions (DK and OL) did show shorter T1-T4 latencies than PF group. For Foton-M3 data (with comparable snail size used), all available latencies (up to T2) are shorter than in preflight controls, thus in agreement with the hypothesis that gravitaxis temporal parameters will change in an opposite fashion after μG than after hypergravity. No differences in T4 duration between μG PF and control groups of snails were found in the data of Bion-M1, also in agreement with the previous study of hypergravity influences and the assumption that the T4 phase may reflect more motor than vestibular function in snails (Popova and Boyle, 2015). A correlation analysis of Bion-M1 behavioral data found T1-T4 phase latencies and durations were positively correlated among themselves in both PF and joined control snails, suggesting a stability of gravitaxis speed during the entire T1-T4 sequence (“slow snails are always slow”). The tentacle length in phases T1-T4 in both PF and control snails showed a positive inter-relation, suggesting the stability of withdrawal reaction during gravitaxis reaction (“afraid snails are always afraid”). Inter-tentacle angles are also positively correlated among themselves during the entire gravitaxis reaction (0-T4), although to a lesser extent than tentacle length and temporal parameters, probably due to the transient nature of this parameter. The tentacle lengths at T0 in the four merged control groups showed weak negative correlations with temporal parameters, together with T0 latency with tentacle length at many phases (Figure 3A). This finding may be interpreted that snails exhibiting more fear (retract tentacles shorter) complete the gravitaxis reaction more slowly. For PF snails such a correlation disappears (Figure 3B), supposedly because the disturbance of statocysts function shortly after landing results in less confidence to vestibular stimuli (habituation of response). Vestibular stimuli sensed by statocysts were shown to be connected to tentacles withdrawal and generalized defensive reaction in snails (see Figure 6 here; Balaban, 1993). Pierantoni (1983) showed the connection of the vertical angle of tentacles and the function of snail statocysts using a spinning disk, and speculated that the vertical angle between the tentacles and the surface is associated with fear in the snail and will depend on the inclination of surface. Inter-tentacle angle in land snails has been investigated mostly in the context of olfactory orientation (Chase and Croll, 1981; Davis, 2004; Davis-Berg, 2012), although tentacle connection with collumellar musculature and hydroskeleton may provide some mechanistic relation of the inter-tentacle angle with muscular or hydraulic tonus of snail; for example, in experiments with predatory snails inter-tentacle angle seems to be correlated with speed of snail crawling (Davis, 2004; Davis-Berg, 2012). In our experiments inter-tentacle angles were measured from the screenshots of different phases of gravitaxis reaction, and the analysis revealed a tendency of the angle to become narrower in late phases in all groups of Bion-M1 and Foton-M3 experiments (Figures S1A, S2C). No specific effects of prolonged μG (PF snails) or short centrifugation (OL snails) on inter-tentacle angle were found in Bion-M1 experiments, although a decrease of inter-tentacle angle in all phases of gravitaxis was found in Foton-M3 experiment (Figure S2C). A possible cause for this discrepancy is a difference of experimental design: repeated testing of snails in Foton-M3 project as opposed to only one test in Bion-M1 snails. Both PF and OL groups show differences in opposite directions in comparison to three other controls in tentacle length at late gravitaxis phase T4 (Figure 2A). Both groups are statocyst-affected, but in an opposite direction, as OL snails were shortly centrifuged, and PF snails were exposed to prolonged μG (plus very similar overloads as OL during landing). In our physiological experiments no changes in background statocyst activity were found, but the response to vestibular stimulation was significantly stronger in PF group in comparison to control groups, and responses of OL group were weaker compared to other control groups (Figure 7). Such physiological differences may underlie the observed behavioral differences.Transcriptome analysis of statocysts The changes in neural cells' morphology, biochemistry and genes expression under space flight conditions are widely accepted (Honda et al., 2012; Pani et al., 2013; Ranjan et al., 2014; Tsybko et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Porseva et al., 2017). Among the most significant differentially expressed genes in PF snails are the neuronal specific precursors of neuropeptides, neurotransmitter receptor subunits, and other genes involved in cell signaling. Gene expression of both the pedal and FMRF-amide peptides were tested by in situ hybridization in earlier Foton studies (Balaban et al., 2011), and were found to be differentially expressed in Bion-M1 PF snails in comparison to ST control snails. In the present Bion-M1 study the genes for these peptides were significantly downregulated in PF-e samples (see Figure 5 and Table S1). In Foton studies preproFMRF-amide gene was found unaltered in control and postflight statocysts using the ISH technique, and preproHPep was found to be upregulated in certain receptor cells. Such discrepancy with Bion-M1 may be explained at least in part by different sensitivity of methods used and also a different Helix species (Helix aspersa L.) was used in Foton-M3 ISH experiment.Adaptation to spaceflight and readaptation process The present study confirmed the electrophysiological findings observed in two earlier Foton satellite missions (Balaban et al., 2011). This study also benefitted from the earlier Foton missions: an earlier animal return to the lab after touchdown was achieved (chartered jet and police escort from the airport) and the experimental protocols evolved to capture as much data as possible in the shortest period of time. Statocyst responses in PF snails of Bion-M1 were comparable to their counterparts in Foton-M3 (see Figure 8), despite more than a 2-fold difference in mission duration. The finding of a postflight hypersensitivity to tilt was confirmed at the level of the whole nerve and single statoreceptor analyses (see Figures 11–13). The statocyst background rate remained unchanged as in the 2007 mission. These findings suggest we measured on a plateau portion of the sensitivity adaptation process, and that the mechanisms underlying in-flight changes, i.e., the μG-induced influence, in statocyst responses are established before 12 days in orbit. We were able to identify the critical time of readaptation to Earth 1G, at ~20 h after landing. Interestingly, hypersensitivity of sensory neurons after spaceflight was found not only in vestibular system, but also in mechanosensory receptors of human skin (Lowrey et al., 2014). The response sensitivity of utricular afferents in the vertebrate toadfish, Opsanus tau, taken post-landing of the orbiters STS-90 (NeuroLab; 16 days in orbit) and STS-95 (9 days in orbit) missions revealed an induced profound hypersensitivity to translational acceleration tests (Boyle et al., 2001). Recordings were also made in separate populations of afferents at numerous time periods after landing to track the rate of recovery. Although some afferents remained hypersensitive, the population as a whole recovered within 24–36 h comparable to readaptation time of snail sensory cells and experienced astronauts, and a bit shorter than a 2–3 day space motion sickness period reported in astronauts during 1G readaptation following 6-month manned missions (Heer and Paloski, 2006). It can be argued in the vertebrate that the rate of adaptation to spaceflight and its recovery after return to Earth are more consistent with a restructuring of the synaptic organization between the hair cells and the afferents, such as adjusting the number of synaptic ribbons or bodies (Ross, 2000), than a restructuring the weight-lending otolith (see below). The toadfish study could not identify whether the hypersensitivity originated in the hair cell, the hair cell-afferent complex, or postsynaptically in the afferent itself. In our Foton and Bion-M1 studies in the snail statocyst we recorded directly from the output of the statoreceptors themselves. Although it is tempting to speculate that the hair cells in vertebrates are also the targets of the sensitivity adjustment to altered gravity loads, direct evidence is still lacking. Vestibular sensitivity in the statocyst of the garden snail was recently studied following exposure to hyper-gravity conditions using centrifugation (Popova and Boyle, 2015). A significant decrease in response sensitivity to head-down tilt was detected after 16- and 32-day (but not 4-day) exposures to a 1.4G [resultant = √1G (Earth)2 + 1G (centripetal)2]. After a 7-day recovery period in normal 1G the responses returned to normal. In accordance with the present study the prevalent gravity level appears represented as a continuum in statocyst function over the measured periods of time. Critical data that are missing and subject to future investigations are the initial responses of the statocyst and organism to an abrupt change in gravity load, the functional and structural consequences of long-term exposure to altered gravity, and the time course of recovery of function as a function of load and duration of exposure.Light cycle influences on the statocyst response Activity recorded in the lip sensory nerve in semi-intact Helix preparations can reflect the circadian phase to which the snail is adapted (Voss et al., 1997). In that study chemical stimuli presented in the light elicited an increased neural response when they corresponded in time to the snail's normal active phase of behavior, viz. scotophase. This species is known to have an endogenous circadian oscillator entrained by light (Bailey and Lazaridou-Dimitriadou, 1986; Attia, 2004), and the circadian pattern of locomotor activity remains with a period of ~25 h in constant darkness for at least 20 days (Bailey and Lazaridou-Dimitriadou, 1986). The interpretation of the present results must take the influences of the light-dark cycle into consideration. Bion-M1 PF snails arrived at the lab in the evening, and the physiological recordings were mostly completed that night. The ST and NV control snails on the other hand were recorded during the daytime. If the statocyst contains a self-sustained peripheral circadian oscillator, it may affect the physiological responses we measured. To exclude such a possibility we performed an additional experiment that confirmed the statocyst response was independent of the circadian time in our preparation (Figure S5). However, the two Bion-M1 control groups with controlled dark conditions (DK and OL, 30 days in dark, recorded in scotophase) and the Foton-M3 control group (DK2007, 12 days in dark, recorded in daytime) show a decreased statocyst response in comparison to ST (natural light cycle, ~16L:8D) and NV (12:12 h LD cycle) control groups (see Figures 7, 8). Despite housed in the dark during the missions, Bion-M1 PF and PF2007 snails showed an increased statoreceptor sensitivity to tilt stimuli, whether recorded at night or during the daytime. This increase sensitivity found only in PF snails was presumably the result of the space environment and not from influences of the housing or time of recording. How these external factors interact to shape the statocyst response is unclear, as well as whether or not the interaction occurs at the same site of plasticity. Another route through which the light-dark cycle might modulate the statocyst activity is via the vestibular efferent fibers (Williamson, 1986; Janse et al., 1988; Tsubata et al., 2003; Sakakibara et al., 2005), that may be entrained by a central circadian oscillator (Attia, 2004). We compared the peri-stimulus curves of efferent activity and found no significant difference between PF and control snails (see Figure 10), thereby excluding the efferent neurons of dynamically modulating the statocyst response on a tilt-by-tilt basis. Whether the substrate for an effect of light-dark cycle is within the statocyst itself or elsewhere remains to be determined.Inertial mass as adaptation mechanism A widely discussed mechanism of adaptation to the μG environment is an adjustment of the weight of statoconia (invertebrates) or otoconia (vertebrates) (Wiederhold et al., 2000; Edelmann, 2002; Gorgiladze, 2002). Deposition of calcium carbonate will affect a change in the mass, but not the weight, in space, but would reveal itself after return to the normal gravity. Ultrastructural studies in Helix found statoconia growth, i.e., size and amount, after long-term exposures to μG on Mir and ISS space stations (Gorgiladze, 2002; Gorgiladze et al., 2011). In Gorgiladze's (2002) study, statoconia size increased with μG exposures between 40 and 148 days, but for shorter exposures the data less clear as the statoconia size after 14 days was larger than after 31 days. Statoconia growth was reversed after return to 1G in about 30 days. In their postflight snails the statoconia were often incrustated by “flakes” or covered by a layer of distinctive crust indicating a deposition of calcium carbonate. Our limited morphological data from Bion-M1 postflight statoconia did not show any of these characteristic features (see Figure 4). However, caution is needed because our sample size was restricted to a single animal in 3 groups and the flight durations were not similar. This compensatory process requires more examination. One more factor is pertinent to the different results reported in Helix studies: in our study adult animals (20–25 g) were used, whereas in the previous studies snails were either juvenile (0.3–2 g) or young adults (9–15 g). The effect of statoconia growth in μG was more pronounced in young snails (Gorgiladze, 2002), and was insignificant in adult fish otoconia (Wiederhold et al., 2003). In addition, our physiological data showed no difference in the magnitude of the sensitivity changes between the postflight groups of our separate missions having different duration of μG exposure (shown in Figure 8). Thus, there is no substantive evidence for a mechanism inducing a change in statoconia mass for snails exposed to μG for less than a month. For the process of readaptation to normal gravity, postflight groups of Bion-M1 and Foton-M3 studies both divided into two distinct subgroups by the critical time of recording 20 h after landing. It is even less likely that changes in statoconia play any role in this readaptation process of such short duration. Taking into account 20 h as critical time of readaptation, neural plasticity of statocyst sensory statoreceptors themselves, central circuits, or both might be better candidates.Role of efferent vestibular neurons The vertebrate inner ear sensory organs receive centripetal innervation of their hair cells (and the dendrites of afferent neurons) by centrally located efferent neurons. This strategy is also present in snail statocyst: the statocyst nerve contains the axons of the statoreceptors as well as axons of neurons from the cerebral ganglion on each side. How the efferent neurons influence the gravity and acceleration sensations during and after space flight is unknown. Assuming the efferent innervation serves to tune the receptor's response to acceleration in a behaviorally relevant context (Goldberg et al., 2002; Boyle et al., 2009; Rabbitt et al., 2010), μG might trigger a shut down of the efferent system to allow an amplification of any input, now weak or absent, signal. If so, this might temporarily lead to a hypersensitivity in snail statoreceptors. In an attempt to address this key issue, we analyzed the firing behavior of presumed efferent neurons to tilt and found it was monotonous within each examined group of snails. Thus, direct evidence that the efferents play a role in the postflight statoreceptor hypersensitivity was not found. We cannot rule out however that the efferent neurons were studied in a behaviorally irrelevant context, namely in the isolated neural preparation and not in the intact animal, and postflight but not inflight.Directionality of response and single unit analysis Previously we reported (Balaban et al., 2011) that the differential sensitivity of statocyst responses to stimuli of different directions (c1 > c2, c3, c4) seen in control snails was lost in the Foton-M3 postflight snails, and we hypothesized a weakening of directional selectivity might occur immediately after spaceflight. Here, we replicated this finding in the Bion-M1 control groups, but the PF snails of Bion-M1 remained spatial tuned to preferred directions (Figures S8, S9). Because of the robustness of the new results we reject our earlier hypothesis that spaceflight influences directional selectivity. Directional selectivity was also maintained in vertebrate otolith afferents with hypersensitivity after spaceflight (Boyle et al., 2001) and in centrifuged snails having reduced overall tilt sensitivity (Popova and Boyle, 2015). We consider this spatial tuning as a fundamental property of statocyst function and not readily susceptible to plastic changes. By spike sorting of the statocyst nerve activity we were able to distinguish the activity of single sensory cells. In some cases the cell activity could identify its possible location in the statocyst, like ventrally located ciliary cells or frontally from caudally located cells. We tried in all cases to find the directionality at the single unit level, but the most active cells in our records frequently showed little to no direction tuning to tilt presented in our protocol; these cells are presumably ventrally located in the statocyst and code more the position of animal in space than stimulus direction (see Figure 11). In the nudibranch Hermissenda the 13 statocyst sensory cells have cilia organized for multidirectional sensitivity (Kuzirian et al., 1981). In Helix some statocyst sensory cells might share a form of this organization in functional terms. Using single unit analysis we identified a few sensory cells that responded to only one of the two tested directions of tilt with a phasic-tonic reaction (see Figure 12). If we consider this to represent a multidirectional sensitivity of a statoreceptor, this type of response might be constructed in frontally and caudally located statoreceptors by a physical contact only with the edge of the inertial mass in the horizontal position of statocyst. Activity of these cells allows the CNS to decode the direction of stimuli from the statocyst output. Comparing the activity of identified statoreceptors, position-coding ventrally located cells form between 50 and 80% of the statocyst output (for OL: ~20 spikes/s, for PF-e: ~30 spikes/s during tilt), and direction-coding cells contribute ~15% of the net response. The only viable candidate to explain the existence of directional response with higher sensitivity (“head down,” c1) is the unpaired sensory neuron at the anterior pole of the statocyst (see Figure 13). Responding to perturbations of vertical orientation of the organism, including human, in the “head down” direction are of critical importance for self-protection, and the unpaired sensory neuron at the anterior pole of the statocyst adds to the net information signal of tilt stimuli in this biologically meaningful direction. Marine mollusks require a fast and reliable recognition of spatial orientation from variable external cues to maintain proper balance and 3D navigation in the sea, and thus their statocyst is the most studied among invertebrates (Wood and Von Baumgarten, 1972; Alkon, 1975; Janse, 1983; Budelmann and Williamson, 1994; Deliagina et al., 1998). In freshwater species, pulmonate Lymnaea, the statocyst output is important for periodical trips to the surface for breathing (Janse, 1982). Janse et al. (1988) compared the statoreceptors firing rate and gain in marine Aplysia and freshwater Lymnaea and speculated that the difference in ecology of the animals leads to a more sensitive statocyst in Aplysia. For land snails vestibular function is important for gravitaxis reaction, when the animals climb to elevated positions for diurnal rest in hot and dry day-time, and when returning back to the soil at dusk (Cowie, 1985; Aubry et al., 2006; Di Lellis et al., 2012). Another obvious biological significance of statocyst function is its role in the withdrawal reaction, as a sudden change of the body position may preclude an attack of a predator. In agreement with ecology of land snails, our physiological data show that the Helix statocyst operates more for coding the orientation of animal's body than fast changes in its direction.Author contributions Research concept and design: NA, AM, VI, IZ, RB, and PB.

    "abstract": "Abstract The utricle provides the vestibular reflex pathways with the sensory codes of inertial acceleration of self motion and head orientation with respect to gravity to control balance and equilibrium. Here we present an anatomical description of this structure in the adult oyster toadfish, and establish a morphological basis for interpretation of subsequent functional studies. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize otolith mass and morphological polarization patterns of hair cells. Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology with respect to epithelial location. Transmission electron micrographs were compiled to create a serial 3-D reconstruction of a labeled afferent over a segment of its dendritic field and to examine the cell-afferent synaptic contacts. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically directed towards a limited number of 7–13 hair cells, but larger dendritic fields in the medial extra-striola can be associated with > 20 hair cells also; and hair cell synaptic bodies can be confined to only an individual afferent or can synapse upon several afferents.

    "introduction": "Introduction Vertebrates possess a highly conserved and elaborate gravito-inertial sensing system in the inner ear. This system comprises two otolith organs, the utricle and saccule, in mammals with the exception of monotremes. A third otolith organ, the lagena, is present in fishes but absent in marsupials and eutherian mammals. Comparative data link the first sensory detectors of the ear primarily to a grouping of hair cells within a simple graviceptive statocyst (Budelmann, 1988) from which the vertebrate inner ear probably evolved (Fritsch et al., 2007). Structurally, the otolith organs consist of layers of neural and non-neural elements. Supporting cells and ciliated hair cells populate the neurosensory epithelium, the “spot” or macula; and the kino- and stereocilia of bundles extending from the apical surface of hair cells are covered with the non-neural gelatinous and fibrous otolith membrane layers (Lim, 1973; Lins et al., 2000; Sokolowski, 1986). Attached to this dense filament matrix are the weight-lending otoconia (grains) or a singular otolith (stone) in fishes. The loose aggregate of the otoconial mass of sharks and rays appears to present a transition to the rigid polycrystalline otolith found in teleosts (Gauldie, 1996). Otoconia are biomineral crystalline deposits of calcium carbonate organized in a calcite lattice in birds and mammals; aragonite is the predominant polymorph in fishes, amphibians and reptiles (Wang et al., 1998). The utricle lies primarily in the horizontal plane and senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation in the forward-backward and left-right directions (or any combination therein) and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. When the head rapidly moves, inertia causes the otolith mass to “lag” behind the sensory epithelium and this force is transmitted to the stereocilia bundle by way of lateral cross-links between the apex of the kinocilium and otolith membrane (Eatock et al., 1987). For slow movement (tilt), the heavier otolith follows the force vector of gravity. Hair cells are directional mechanosensors, and the resulting bending of their hair bundles begins the transduction cascade that transforms the vector sum of the imposing accelerations into a neural code (Hudspeth & Corey, 1977). The hair cell polarities (Flock, 1964; Maklad et al., 2010) and their coordinated distribution (Sienknecht et al., 2014) on the utricular epithelium ensure that all movements in the horizontal plane are adequately sensed, and the vector of stimulation by particle motion in both the horizontal and vertical planes is encoded by the range of hair cell orientations on the saccule of the toadfish (Edds-Walton & Fay, 2002). In humans, primary afferents innervating the otolith organs carry their constructed vector code in the form of modulated spacing of action potentials to the vestibular nuclei and cerebellum. There it is combined with angular motion signals obtained from the semicircular canals and with sensory cues derived from the visual, proprioceptive, tactile, cognitive and visceral systems to compute a central representation of the body and its parts as well as their dynamics in space. This representation is called the gravito-inertial vector (see Merfeld et al., 1999) and is an important transformation that the brain constructs to resolve the ambiguity of gravity and self-motion and thereby maintain balance and equilibrium under varying conditions in healthy individuals. The utricle can be adversely affected by trauma and disease and is directly implicated in space motion sickness and disorientation during space missions (Reschke et al. 1994) and readaptation upon return to Earth’s 1g (Boyle et al., 2001). The structural organization of the sensory epithelia and the otoliths have been studied in species of fishes (Dale, 1976; Flock, 1964; Hama, 1969; Popper, 1976, 1977, 1978; Platt, 1977, 1983; Dunkelberger et al., 1980; Jenkins, 1981; Chang et al., 1992; Lu & Popper, 1998; Platt et al., 2004; Popper & Lu, 2000; Buran et al., 2005; Lovell et al., 2006; Schulz-Mirbach et al., 2011), including toadfish (Sokolowski & Popper, 1987, 1988), and also in amphibians (Kachar et al., 1990; Kurc et al., 1999), retiles (Xue & Peterson, 2006), birds (Si et al., 2003; Dickman et al., 2004; Zahir et al., 2012), and mammals (Lim, 1984; Yaku et al., 1989; Lins et al., 2000; Desai et al., 2005). The development and evolution of the inner ear sensory epithelia and their innervation patterns has been extensively investigated by Fritzsch and co-workers (Fritzsch et al., 2002, 2007; Duncan & Fritzsch, 2012; Beisel et al., 2005) and Streit (2001; Lleras-Forero & Streit, 2012) and recently reviewed by Manley et al. (2013) and Friedman & Giles, 2017), and provide insights into the molecular and structural commonality and diversity found in the animal phyla. The aim of the present study is to describe the structure of the utricle in the adult oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, as a model vertebrate species. As noted by Sokolowski & Popper (1988) the vestibular epithelium of adult Opsanus is not an oddity, but is similar in both gross and fine structure to that of many other fishes except the herring (Popper & Platt, 1979). The toadfish is noted for its survivability in harsh environments, such as extended exposure to cold climate or even stasis, its longevity (>40 years), its low food demands, and this vertebrate species’ neural response to altered gravity that likely mimics that of man (Boyle et al., 2001). Our knowledge of the consequences of long duration space on human health is inferential. We have no biological sample return of any vertebrate species exposed to deep space upon which to analyze, evaluate, model and predict the outcome of the mission. An essential goal here is to provide the framework of the inherent design of the hair cell and afferent organization schemes in this animal to serve as the morphological basis for concurrent and subsequent studies of the physiological responses of the otolith organ under normal and novel gravitational conditions.",
    "methods": "Methods All procedures followed the principles of laboratory animal care set forth by the National Institutes of Health “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (National Academy Press) and approved by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult oyster toadfish, (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=8068) Opsanus tau, of both sexes and weighing ~400 gm were provided by the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA) and shipped overnight to NASA Ames Research Center. Fish were temporarily housed in several complete self-contained, controlled 300L seawater aquaria systems (Aqua Logic, Inc.; San Diego, CA) and monitored daily by the Animal Care Facility. In all experiments, fish were first immersed in MS222 (25 mg/l, 3-Aminobenzoic Acid Ethyl Ester; Sigma Cat# E10521) diluted in seawater, and relaxed by an intramuscular injection of pancuronium bromide (0.05 mg/kg); pancuronium bromide does not block opercular motion and allows for natural respiration. The fish were then cranially immobilized with stainless steel pins in a plastic tank filled with fresh, chilled (15° C) seawater covering all but the dorsal surface of the animal. The eyes and remainder of the body were kept covered with moist tissues. Seawater was aerated using an air stone. A small craniotomy was made to allow direct access to the right superior division of the vestibular nerve from the brain to the structures it supplies, namely the anterior and horizontal semicircular canals and the utricle. Fluorocarbon (FC-75; 3M Corp, Minneapolis, MN) was injected into the cranial opening to create a fluid barrier, help maintain oxygenation of the perilymphatic vestibule, and aid in visualizing structures of interest. Neuronal Labeling and Microscopy To bulk label afferent projections to the utricle the utricular nerve was isolated from the canal nerves using Parafilm®M and biocytin crystals (Sigma B4261) were inserted directly into multiple areas of the nerve near the macula using the tip of a glass micropipette. The opening was temporarily closed using sutures and the fish was allowed to survive for 12–18 hrs. To intracellularly label individual afferents, conventional borosilicate glass microelectrodes filled with a 2% solution of biocytin (Molecular Probes; Cat# B-1592) in 2 M LiCl2 and buffered (pH 7.2) with a dc impedance of 40–100 MΩ were inserted into the utricular nerve near the macula. Axonal penetration was signaled by a −40 to −60 mV resting potential that stabilized after several seconds. The axon was labeled by passing positive current pulses of 10–20 nA (1/sec 80% duty cycle) for 2–10 min through the electrode. To fix the macula for microscopy a small opening was made in the dorsalmost aspect of the anterior semicircular canal midway between the ampulla and common crus, and a glass pipette with ~50μm opening was inserted into its lumen directed rostrally towards the anterior ampulla. The pipette was attached to a 1 ml syringe, and the utricular endolymph was first gently flushed with 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and replaced with fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in buffer for light and scanning electron microscope imaging. In selected fish an alternative fixation solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sucrose and 0.2% picric acid in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was used for an ultrastructural study of the utricular macula using transmission electron microscopy. The perfusates in each case were colorized using alcion green to visualize the fluids flowing across the anterior ampulla, entering the utricular macular space and duct, and exiting via the common crus from the distal end of the cut canal limb. A heavy sedative dose of 0.5M MS222 was then placed in the tank for >5 minutes, the fish was removed, its heart was exposed, heparin (1 kU) was injected into the conus of the heart, and the fish was transcardially perfused with 500 ml cold heparinized toadfish Ringer solution followed by an equal volume of the particular fixative. The utricle and a portion of the nerve were extracted, together with the brain, and immersed in the same fixative. The utricular maculae were harvested and prepared for microscopic analysis of stained and unstained samples. Labeled processes were visualized using a protocol of VECTASTAIN ABC Staining Kit (RRID:AB_2336827 Vector Lab; Cat# PK-6100). Following overnight fixation the tissue was rinsed with 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB), immersed in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 hr, rinsed again, placed in a solution of 10 mL 0.1M PB and equal parts of ABC Vectastain solutions and 20 μL Triton X-100 for at least 3 hr, rinsed again, soaked in a 5 mL solution of a 3, 3′- diaminobenzidene (Sigma; Cat# 261890) and 0.12 gm nickel ammonium sulfate for 1 hr, to which 100 μL of 0.003% H2 O2 was added to the final step. For scanning electron microscopy (Leo 1450 Variable Pressure Secondary Electron) unstained samples were left in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate solution overnight, osmicated (2%), dehydrated in an ethanol series, critical point dried, mounted and sputter coated with gold/palladium. Light and transmission electron microscopy (Leo 912 AB) were used to evaluate both labeled and unstained samples. The utricle was post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide with 1.25% potassium ferrocyanide, en bloc stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 30% ethanol, rapidly dehydrated, infiltrated, and embedded in Epon. Blocks were serially sectioned using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome into 1μm survey sections for light microscopy and 180 nm thin sections for ultrastructure analysis. Digital mosaics of 100μm in length were captured at 5kX magnification with a side-mounted SIS MegaView III camera and assembled with AnalySIS® image analysis software. Mosaics assembled from every seventh section of the striolar and extra-striolar regions served as maps for tracking individually numbered hair cells in non-mosaic sections. Identified hair cells within each non-mosaic section were examined at 8kX magnification for the presence of synaptic bodies and hair cell afferent synapses. Images of candidate synaptic areas or unresolved cell membranes were captured at 12.5kX magnification to either confirm or refute synaptic bodies for data analysis and to discern cell membrane boundaries for serial reconstruction. Traced contours of selected objects in consecutive sections were then registered, smoothed, connected, and reassembled with NASA’s Reconstruction of Serial Sections (ROSS) software (Chimento et al., 1994; Montgomery, 1996). The ROSS software generates a surface mesh around completed contours which were then rendered in color-coded solid or semi-transparent form to view internal structures. Completed reconstructions were ported to a 3D viewing software to provide the best perspective of the image, saved in tiff format, and edited in RRID:SCR_014199 Adobe® Photoshop® for brightness and contrast. Measures are given in mean ± SD. Afferent Reconstruction and Analysis From a group of 18 toadfish utricles, two were selected for their superior staining quality to be reconstructed. Each tissue section was viewed under ×40 (Leitz Diaplan) magnification. The slides were mounted on a computer-motorized stage, which transmitted information to the software program RRID:SCR_001775 Neurolucida (MicroBrightField) for analysis. On each slide, contours were traced around the 1) the perimeter of the resin block in which the utricle was embedded, 2) the border of the basement membrane of the utricle, and 3) the border of overlying epithelium to the apical surface of the hair cells. The resulting contours on each section were used for standardization. Only the darkly labeled afferent and efferent processes were followed and traced throughout the sections. Afferents that were only partly stained or afferents that overlapped were discarded from analysis because they could not be discriminated with adequate certainty. Three-dimensional analysis was conducted after obtaining the process(es) tracing with the Neurolucida Explorer software program. A number of morphological parameters for each afferent was measured and quantified; axonal length, volume, number of nodes (branching points), and number of terminal boutons. Measures presented are given in mean ± SD.",
    "results": "Results General Description of the Toadfish Utricle Figure 1 shows a micro-computed tomography scan (a) and a macroscopic view at the light level (b) of the left labyrinth and the 3 sensory epithelia supplied by the superior division of the vestibular (8th cranial) nerve (labeled from lateral to medial: Horizontal Canal (HC) nerve (n), Anterior Canal (AC) nerve (n), and Utricle (U) nerve (n)); in modern bony fishes the superior division also supplies the hair cells in the posterior semicircular canal ampulla. Individual utricular fibers were measured at the light microscopy level (40X oil magnification) in 6 fish where the AC and U nerves were clearly separate (see Fig. 1b), and their diameter averaged 5.4 ± 2.6 μm (SD; range 1.3 – 13.3 μm; n=1654). The utricle (U), with the anterior canal (AC) ampulla opening into its anterior end and the horizontal canal (HC) ampulla opening laterally (Fig. 1), and the saccule, together with the lagena as the third otolith structure located on its posterior end, make up the two main membranous compartments of the toadfish labyrinth. The utricle is essentially an elongated sac consisting of the utricular duct continuing anteriorly and widening to become the utricular recess. The posterior canal ampulla opens into the utricular duct posterior to the common crus of the vertical canals, which opens onto the upper middle surface of the utricular duct. The utricular recess is slightly concave and contains the utricular macula, with the main orientation of the macula in the plane of the horizontal canal (Fig. 2a). Since the sensory neuroepithelia are not encased in a bony labyrinth as in higher vertebrates, access to the separate nerves and epithelia is straightforward and under visual control. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Micro-computed tomography scan (a; 20 μm resolution) and a macroscopic view (b; light microscopy) of the anterior segment of the left vestibular labyrinth of the toadfish. Both images in panels a and b are similarly viewed from the top (dorsal), and their orientation with respect the head is given in panel a. The otolith mass was highlighted by false color in panel a. In panel b portions of the membranous labyrinth were removed to expose the cristae (arrows) of the horizontal (HC) and anterior (AC) canals and above the utricular (U) otolith mass. The vestibular nerve separates into individual branches indicated by colored arrows (HCn, ACn and Un) supplying each sensory structure.Figure 2. Open in a new tab a: Macroscopic view (SEM) of the left vestibular labyrinth. Orientation of image in panel a (dorsal view) is ~45° clockwise rotated with respect to panels a and b in Fig. 1 (as indicated). Labels the same as Fig. 1. The otolith mass was flipped horizontally off the utricular macula. The smooth ventral surface of the otolith mass covers the neurosensory epithelium. The two asterisks correspond to the 2 arrows in panel a of Fig. 4. b: Enlarged view of the more caudal-medial side of the ventral surface of the otolith mass shows the ragged and complex layered composition of the mass, presumably providing anchoring points to the vestibule. C: honeycomb remnants of otolith membrane on the ventral surface of the otolith. Otolith and Gel/Otolith Membrane In Fig. 2a the otolith mass was flipped horizontally to reveal its ventral surface facing the sensory macula. The smooth protuberance in the middle of the ventral surface of the otolith (gibbus maculae) lies above the hair cell zone of the macula (also see Fig.4a). Opposing this central portion of the otolith are two areas (shown in Fig. 2a and one is enlarged in Fig. 2b) of diverse structural organization (extremi) likely allowing greater adhesion to the utricular duct. While slight variations in otolith morphology were noted between samples (see Table 1), common characteristics predominated. The average dimension of the otolith is about 1.5 mm in length by 1 mm in width. The size of the otolith along its medial-lateral axis is about 2-fold greater than underlying sensory macula, but is only slightly greater along its anterior-posterior axis. The most uneven and irregular areas of the utricular otolith are located away from the AC and HC ampullae, and are not in close proximity to the neuroepithelium of the utricle or walls of the canal lumen. On average the otolith mass weighs ~2 mg. The elemental composition of the otolith was determined using energy dispersive X-ray spectral analysis (Fig. 3) and revealed an expected dominance by calcium (the highest calcium Ka peak, a smaller calcium Kb peak, and the very low calcium line at 0.34 KeV); traces of oxygen (O) and phosphorous (P), perhaps due to the naturally mineral form of calcium apatite – hydroxylapatite, were present. In contrast to the human otoconia atomic elements K, Na, Mg, S, and Cl, likely due to the protein nucleus in early development (Anniko et al., 1984), were not detected. No studies were done to reveal the organic components of the otolith mass. Figure 4.

GL that cover the apical hair cell surface to the ventral surface of the otolith mass is partially visible in this preparation. Arrows indicate the location of the two rough and jagged ends of the otolith mass after its removal, and correspond to the asterisks in panel a of Fig. 2 to illustrate how the otolith mass lies on the macula surface. Arrowheads mark the edge of the hair cell zone. White asterisk lies on the non-neural wall of the utricle near the horizontal ampulla and marks the location of the insert. Insert: higher magnification shows two (white arrowheads) of the numerous rod-like protuberances from the wall. b: Portion of the macula shows a region of exposed hair bundles devoid of GL (lower), another marginally covered immediately above the apical surface of the hair cells (center), and another region with the GL covering the hair bundle (arrowhead). c: Enlarged view of GL (arrowheads) in b. d: Layering of the OM (arrowheads) on top of the hair bundles in the third preparation.Table 1.

Open in a new tab Energy dispersive X-ray spectrum of utricular otolith (Hitachi S-4000 field emission SEM with a light element Noran X-ray detector); 2KX center technique: least squares fit. Highest calcium Ka peak, smaller calcium Kb peak, and the very low calcium line at 0.34 KeV were obtained. Elements present were Ca (20) and O (8). Atomic elements K, Na, Mg, S, and Cl were not detected.Between the otolith and the sensory epithelium is the fibrous layer comprised of an otolith membrane (OM) near the otolith mass and the gel layer (GL) beneath it closest to the apical surface of the hair cells. Because the composition of this layer, and particularly the GL in which the hair bundles penetrate, makes it vulnerable to fixation, only limited views of the layer are presented here. Patches of OM can be usually observed on the ventral surface of the otolith (Fig. 2a, c), often having a “honeycomb” appearance. In some cases the layer remained partially intact after processing. Examples are shown in Fig. 4. In panel a, the GL partially remains from the apical surface of the hair cells to below the tips of the hair bundles, exposing the topmost apex of the hair bundles; arrowheads mark the edge of the hair cell zone of the macula. The entire neuroepithelium, including the posterolateral subgroup of hair cells in the lacinium (highlighted in Fig. 5a, c), is covered by the GL. Comparing the OM attached to the otolith in Fig. 2a with the images in Fig. 4 confirms that the layer is not homogeneous in density (Sokolowski, 1986) and the GL immediately surrounding the hair bundle apex is more vulnerable to fixation (Johnsson & Hawkins, 1967; Nakai et al., 1996; Andrade et al., 2012). The arrowheads in Fig. 4a point toward the regions beneath the jagged ends of the otolith not covering the macula shown in Fig. 2 (asterisks in a). Rod-like protuberances (insert, white arrowheads) extend from the non-neural walls and likely help anchor the otolith to the non-neural epithelium (* in Fig. 4a) or fibrils interconnecting otoconia in mammals (Andrade et al., 2012). Figure 4b (and expanded portion in 4c) shows in a separate fish the apical surface of the hair cells mostly bare of the GL (lowest section), or matted by the GL (center section), or partially embedded in the GL (arrowheads, uppermost section). Fig. 4d shows a top down view of the macula in another fish to illustrate exposed hair cells, hair cells partially exposed with the honeycomb matrix, and fully covered by the layering of the OM. Figure 5. Open in a new tab SEM images of the left utricular macula. a: macroscopic view of the hair cell epithelium outlined in white and the reversal line within the striola marked by the yellow line. Representative morphological polarization of the hair bundle is marked by red arrows, with the arrow pointing towards the kinocilium. White arrow indicates the lacinium. Panel a corresponds to the light micrograph of Fig. 1b. Asterisk (white) within the macula approximates the enhanced view given in b. See text for a description of the hair cell density variation in these regions. b: Higher magnification of the hair cell zones under the anterior ampulla (AC) in a. The cyan lines estimated the three regions of the macula: the lateral extra-striola (upper section), the medial extra-striola (lower section), and the striola (center section). The yellow line within the striola was drawn to precisely indicate the reversal line where the hair cell bundle polarity shifts 180°. Note that the reversal line is not a smooth line, but shows some irregularity. The red arrows mark the direction of the hair cell bundle polarity. c: mosaic of the lacinium (or thumb) pointing towards the horizontal canal (HC). Hair cells reside on a relatively narrow and sloped surface of the macula. The reversal line is again drawn in yellow and marks the exact shift in hair cell bundle polarity. Note that the polarity of the hair bundles is now parallel to the reversal line with those on the top portion directed more medially and the on the bottom portion in the opposite sense (also indicated in panel a). Representative images of individual hair cells are shown in the inserts and yellow boxes mark their locations. Macula Organization The outline of the hair cell epithelium of the macula is drawn in white in Fig. 5a. The macula lies largely in a two-dimensional plane except in the anterior curvature beneath the anterior canal (AC) and the more three-dimensional thumb-like extension directed toward the horizontal canal (HC) called the lacinium (in more detail in Fig. 5c). The shape of the macula in toadfish resembles that of other vertebrates, such as frog (Baird & Schuff, 1994), pigeon (Si, 1999), and chinchilla (Fernández et al., 1990), with a short and long axes lying mostly in the horizontal plane of the head. More variation is found in the position of the striola. In mammals it is more centrally located (Li et al. 2008), whereas in frog, pigeon, and fishes (Flock & Duvall, 1965) the striola lies near the lateral border and spans nearly the entire length of the macula. The reversal line (estimated in yellow) is the point at which the morphological polarization of the hair bundle flips 180°. The morphological polarization of the hair bundle is given by the direction of the shortest stereocilia to the kinocilium (Flock, 1964) and defines the hair cell’s functional polarity (Hudspeth & Corey, 1977). As in the utricles of other species the kinocilium of opposing hair bundles face each other at reversal line in toadfish, except in the lacinium, and the red arrows show the hair bundle polarity at selected locations on the macula. In Fig. 5b a view of the macula ventrocaudal to the AC (marked by the * in a) is given to illustrate the three zones of the macula estimated by the cyan lines. Between the lateral (upper) and medial (lower) zones is the striola containing hair cells that straddle the reversal line (in yellow); here the reversal line is precisely drawn to split the hair cells with opposing hair bundle polarity. The lateral extra-striola macula is a relatively thin zone, but contains the highest density of hair cells/100μm (11.8 ± 1; n=189 in one count), whereas the medial extra-striola macula is the largest zone and its hair cell density/100μm in the same count (6.8 ± 0.2; n=106) is slightly greater to that in the least populated striola (5.5 ± 0.5; n=89); again, red arrows show the direction of the hair bundle polarity from the shortest to the kinocilium. Fig. 5c is a composite mosaic of SEM images taken in the lacinium. The reversal line (in yellow) splits the hair cells having opposing hair bundle polarization. The hair bundle polarities in the lacinia are not directed toward the reversal line as elsewhere but are orthogonal to the norm in the macula and run parallel to the reversal line; the inserts show an enlarged view of a representative hair cell in each of these opposing sections (each location is marked by a yellow box). The kinocilia of the hair bundles in the lacinia differ in length, resembling more canal hair bundles, than the shorter kinocilia found elsewhere in the utricle. The hair cells in this specialized region lie on a 45–60° slope, implying that hair cells respond more to angular roll on a steeply pitched plane of the head to right, contralateral, ear down in the rostral subdivision or to left, ipsilateral, ear down in the caudal subdivision. Further, since the anterior portion of the toadfish utricle curves dorsally and the striola crosses the mediolateral axis of the anterior macula, hair cells there should sense vertical acceleration when the head is in its normal posture. The anterior utricle of mammals also curves upward into the frontal plane of the head, but the striola is more centrally located. Utricular Afferent Organization in the Macula Despite the homogeneity of bouton-like afferent innervation of hair cells their dendritic morphology was not uniform. Three regions of the macula were differentiated into the striola, and the medial and lateral extra-striola macula. The photomicrographs of Fig, 6 (a–c) show labeled afferent processes in each of the three regions. The innervation patterns of 54 labeled primary utricular afferents are mapped in Fig. 7 and show marked differences in fiber length, fiber volume, nodes per fiber, and number of bouton terminals per fiber regionally (see Table 2) with all afferents terminating in bouton-like endings. There is a direct correlation of the afferent dendritic branching patterns and the density of the hair cells in the region they supply. Afferents with the greatest complexity supply the most densely populated medial extra-striola and those with the most simplistic dendritic trees supply the least populated striola; parameters in the lateral extra-striola fell in the middle. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Light microscopic images of biocytin-labeled afferent dendritic processes in the three hair cell zones of the macula. a: Afferents of the medial extra-striola macula have the more complex organization of their dendrites in the utricle, containing more branch points and processes that extend dorsally toward the more apical regions of the outer lateral membrane of hair cells (arrows). b: In the striola one utricular afferent is seen with a simplistic level of terminal arborizations. Presumed synaptic contacts occur at en passant swellings (arrows) along the extension of the afferent dendrite at the base of the hair cell somata layer. c: Afferents of the lateral extra-striola have a more moderate terminal arborizations complexity. Note the pseudocalyx specialization (arrow) in close proximity to the basolateral surface of hair cells. Abbreviations: BM, basement membrane; SC, layer containing the nuclei of supporting cells.

Fig. 6a shows the terminal endings of one afferent. Similar to other utricular afferents, the parent axon extends through the basement membrane and entered the basolateral surface of the neuroepithelium. These afferents produced numerous branch points in the hair cell (HC) zone of the macula. Whereas the dendrites of afferents supplying the striola were confined largely to the basal and basolateral regions of the hair cells, afferents supplying the medial extra-striola formed apparent synaptic contact sites also along the hair cell surface extending high up its lateral wall (arrows) above the basolateral area of the hair cell soma where the synaptic bodies are typically located (Eatock & Lysakowski, 2006). Huwe et al. (2015) found a similar finding in the turtle utricle and termed these dendritic spines. Thirty afferent fibers were reconstructed in the medial macula and are mapped in Fig. 7 and representative 4 fibers are given in Fig. 8a. The mean values for each of the morphological parameters in 30 afferents characterized in the medial extra-striola macula were the largest of the population (see Table 2). Despite the wide variability among afferent measures, afferents supplying this region contained, on average, the greatest complexity of dendritic structure with the greatest terminal fiber length (358 ± 244μm), the greatest terminal fiber volume (1239 ± 1400μm3), and the greatest number of nodes per fiber (7.6 ± 6.6), and bouton terminals (9.4 ± 7.5). Figure 8. Open in a new tab Selected reconstructions of labeled utricular afferent supplying hair cells in the medial extra-striola (a), striola (b), and lateral extra-striola (c) regions of the macula. In general afferents having the more complex dendritic arborizations supply the more densely populated medial extra-striola macula, those with an intermediate complexity supplied the lateral extra-striola macula, and those afferents with the simplest dendritic tress were found in the least populated striola.Striola The photomicrograph of Fig. 6b depicts the more simplistic morphological features of afferents supplying the striola. A single parent axon originating from the utricular nerve penetrates the basement membrane (BM) and enters the supporting cell (SC) layer of the macula. The afferent is likely to make synaptic contact onto the basal surfaces of multiple hair cells at en passant swellings (several are marked by black arrows) along the length of dendritic processes. The parent axon typically extends through the neuroepithelium unbranched and is directed along an axis nearly perpendicular to the reversal line of the macula (Fig. 7). Seventeen afferents in the striola were reconstructed and their positions on the utricular macula are shown in Fig. 7 (shaded area) and a selected 7 afferents in Fig. 8b. Although the number is low, an afferent’s dendritic tree was not seen to cross the reversal line. Afferents supplying the striola possessed the least complexity of their dendritic structure, containing the shortest terminal fiber length (166 ± 78 μm), the smallest terminal fiber volume (310 ± 317μm3), nodes per fiber (1.4 ± 1.7), and the least number of identified bouton terminals (2.5 ± 1.7) (Table 2).Lateral Extra-Striola The photomicrograph of Fig. 6c depicts several morphological features of afferents supplying the lateral extra-striolar macula, and the oddity of a pseudocalyx specialization (arrow). Again, the afferent penetrates the basement membrane and courses along the basolateral surface of hair cells. In this region of the macula, afferents display a few branches and showed an intermediate level of complexity of the dendritic structure. Seven afferent fibers were reconstructed in the lateral macula and are mapped in Fig. 7 and representative fibers are reconstructed in Fig. 8c. These afferents possessed a short terminal fiber length (166 ± 77Vm) similar to the afferents supplying the striola, a slightly larger terminal fiber volume (379 ± 163Vm3) than afferents supplying the striola, an intermediate numbers of nodes per fiber (3.1 ± 2.7) and number of bouton terminals (4.7 ± 2.7) (see Table 2).Synaptic Organization in the Macula Fig. 9 shows ultrastructure properties of the macula. Synaptic bodies (labeled SB in Fig. 9b and enlarged in Fig. 9c–e) lie within hair cells at the hair cell-afferent synapse. As in the other vestibular endorgans brainstem efferent neurons form synaptic contacts with both the hair cell (labeled E in panel b) and afferents (Fig. 10; for more details in the toadfish see Holstein et al., 2004). The number of synaptic bodies per 100μm × 100μm was determined by TEM using serial reconstruction from 180 nm (thickness) sections for two macular regions, one straddling the reversal line and the other 150 μm away in the medial extra-striola macula. On average each hair cell in the striola contains 4.65 ± 3.4 synaptic bodies (n=223, corresponding to 30 hair cells based on measured density) and its counterpart in the medial extra-striola area contains significantly more (6.92 ± 5.53; n=505, corresponding to 46 hair cells based on measured density) synaptic bodies (p<0.001; unpaired t-test for difference in mean, df=74). Typically, a single SB exists with a gap between adjacent ones, but doublets (Fig. 9c) are not uncommon, and multiple clusters (not shown) are occasionally observed. In Fig. 9d a biocytin-labeled afferent (dark structure in center) is synaptically coupled with two adjacent hair cells and in Fig. 9e an afferent process is sandwiched between SBs of two hair cells. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Synaptic organization of the toadfish utricle. Transmission electron microscopic images show the innervation patterns of hair cells’ synaptic bodies (SB) and afferent processes (a–e). a: Low magnification of the hair cell layer in the macula. Synaptic bodies within hair cells were identified at higher resolution and some are marked by red arrows on the internal wall along the basal and basolateral membrane of the hair cell (HC). Somata of hair cells are shown in the hair cell layer. Dorsal is upward, and remnants of several hair bundles are visible Two selected afferent dendritic processes are marked in blue, and a lone efferent terminal (E) is marked by the yellow arrow. b: Higher magnification of synaptic organization. As in the semicircular canal cristae of the toadfish labyrinth (Sans and Highstein, 1984; Holstein et al., 2004), efferent terminals (E in yellow) form synaptic complexes with hair cells (shown) and afferents (not shown here). Four synaptic bodies (SB) were identified by their halos of synaptic vesicles in this section, along with two separate afferent fibers. c: pair of synaptic bodies (red arrows) onto an afferent process in the medial extra-striola. Note the synaptic bodies are at the level of the hair cell nucleus (see Fig. 6b). d: a biocytin-labeled afferent process (A) is seen receiving synaptic contacts from adjacent hair cells. e: similar to d, an afferent process courses between two separate hair cells and receives synaptic contacts from each. The thickenings of the afferent’s subsynaptic membrane (marked with yellow arrows) are associated with the synaptic bodies (red arrows).Figure 10. Open in a new tab Presumptive efferent terminations on afferent dendrites in supporting cell (SC) layer. Processes in a and b were labeled with biocytin and their apparent synaptic specializations, such as en passant and terminal boutons (marked by yellow arrows), are seen in the neuroepithelial layer immediately dorsal to the basement membrane (BM) where the afferents lose their myelin and where hair cell (HC) somata are absent. Synaptic contacts of efferent axons onto supporting cells (SC) have not been reported, indicating axo-dendritic connections between efferent neurons and afferent dendrites. These presumed efferent processes were infrequently encountered. Scale bars, 5 μm.Two presumptive efferent axons labeled with biocytin are shown in Fig. 10 (a and b). The process in panel a is likely a terminal ending and that in panel B possesses en passant and terminal boutons (yellow arrows). In both cases the synaptic specializations are seen in the zone populated by the somata of supporting cells (SC) and the afferent dendrites between the basement membrane (BM), where the utricular afferent losses its myelin, and the hair cell (HC) soma layer. Since efferent axons have not been reported to innervate supporting cells, the highlighted processes likely represent axo-dendritic sites between efferent axons and afferent dendrites. It should be noted these indicators of efferent innervation were sought but infrequently encountered. An unexpected observation was made and is illustrated in Fig. 11. In panel a the principal dendrite of a biocytin-labeled afferent is seen coursing along the basal surfaces of the hair cells (somata in the Hair Cell Layer) above the nuclei of the supporting cell (SC) in the striola. Dorsal arrow marks a hair bundle above the apical surface of the hair cell. Double arrows point to the basement membrane (BM) of the neuroepithelium. Two distinct synaptic bodies were seen in the section (#19 of the series) outlined by the box and enlarged in Fig. 10b. The inserts show images of the synaptic bodies at the same magnification immediately before (#18) and immediately after (#20) the main section (#19). Of particular note is the absence of any terminal processes, such as synaptic varicosity (e.g. Fig. 6a) or a clear en passant bouton-like ending (e.g. Fig. 6b), on the afferent dendrite. To the extent that these type of synapses exist without an obvious afferent specialization is not known, but their existence has implications for understanding the functional organization of the macula. Figure 11. Open in a new tab Transmission electron photomicrographs shows the course of a biocytin-labeled utricular afferent in the macula between the supporting cell (SC) and hair cell layers (double arrows mark the basement membrane, BM) in the striolar region of the macula (hair bundle marked by a single arrow above the apical surface of a hair cell). a: section 19 of the serial reconstruction is a mosaic of the sensory epithelium taken at 5KX. Note that no clear dendritic specializations of the labeled afferent are evident. b: enlargement of the box in A. Two synaptic bodies are evident in this section, and were observed in the prior (sec18) and subsequent (sec20) sections overlaid as boxes. Of particular interest is that the synaptic areas were not associated with any apparent afferent specialization such as a bouton-like swelling.A 32D serial reconstruction of a biocytin-labeled utricular afferent is shown in Fig. 12 and highlights novel findings on hair cell-afferent organization. Ninety serial sections taken at 180 nm thickness were used to reconstruct the partial dendritic processes and hair cell contacts of this afferent at the TEM level. Labeled afferent is depicted in yellow, hair cell membranes are shaded in blue and green, hair cell nuclei are colored in dark blue and purple, and the hair cell synaptic bodies associated with the labeled afferent are shown as red spheres and those with other afferent processes are shown as green spheres. The uniqueness of this experiment is the observation that a given hair cell directs, in this example, virtually all of its synaptic bodies to one afferent. The afferent here exhibited dendritic varicosities, such as swellings, associated with synaptic bodies. Like elsewhere in the macula, the labeled afferent dendritic process followed a “beam” of hair cells that exclusively innervated it (8 SBs in hair cell in e; 9 SBs in hair cell in f). Eleven of the twelve reconstructed hair cells distributed their entire synaptic bodies to the labeled afferent. The sole hair cell exception is shown in h. The hair cell contained 10 synaptic bodies, 5 in contact with the labeled afferent and 5 onto a single and separate unlabeled (not reconstructed) afferent process. Figure 12. Open in a new tab 3D serial reconstruction of a biocytin-labeled utricular afferent and its synaptic relationship with the hair cells it contacted. Ninety serial sections taken at 180 nm were used to reconstruct the dendritic processes and hair cell contacts of this afferent at the TEM level. Labeled afferent is yellow, hair cell membranes are blue and green, hair cell nuclei are dark blue and purple, and hair cell synaptic bodies associated with the labeled afferent are red and those with other afferent processes are green. Panel a is an anterior view and b is a posterior view of the labeled afferent and its synaptic organization with hair cells. Twelve hair cells are reconstructed. White boxes represent enlargement in D. Inserts in a and b show two views of afferent’s dendritic tree and support the findings of Figs 6–10. Similar to afferents supplying the striola this labeled afferent had a limited branching pattern and tracked along the baso-lateral surfaces of the hair cells. The synaptic bodies in the hair cells are partially obscured by cell features, and were duplicated and placed in darkened regions in panels c–h. White arrows in panels c, d, e and h point the highlighted synaptic bodies to the afferent as a whole; the single white arrow in e points to mixture (red and green) of synaptic bodies and the synaptic body clusters (red) to the other two hair cells are copied and placed below the afferent for better visualization; the double set of white arrows in panels f and g point the highlighted synaptic bodies to the afferent separately as indicated. c: afferent is seen cupping two hair cells. d: cell on the far right appears to have only two synaptic bodies. As revealed by the mesh overlays in a and b, which show all synaptic bodies in the corresponding hair cells and the labeled afferent, two additional synaptic bodies are found in this hair cell as it drapes over the labeled afferent (white boxes). e: eight synaptic bodies can be seen in a single hair cell (far right) onto an individual afferent bouton. f: hair cell contains nine synaptic bodies, all in relation to the club-like ending of the labeled afferent. This is a common observation: the afferent follows a beam of hair cells that appear to exclusively target it. g: hair cell on left is an anterior view of the green hair cell in f, and hair cell on the right (white asterisk) is an anterior view of the green hair cell highlighted in h (asterisk). h: hair cell contains 10 synaptic bodies, 5 in contact with the labeled afferent and 5 onto a single and separate unlabeled process (not reconstructed in this figure).",
    "discussion": "Discussion As a prelude to our efforts to understand the impact of normal and altered gravitational environment(s) on the neurovestibular system it is essential to provide a detailed description of the general morphology of the utricular otolith in our selected model, the toadfish, to establish the benchmarks for reference. For even relatively short exposures of 12–16 days in a near weightlessness environment aboard the shuttle orbiters (STS-90 and −95) the vestibular nerve afferents supplying the utricle of the toadfish underwent an enormous adjustment of their response sensitivity to an adequate inertial acceleration as revealed by physiological tests using controlled translational acceleration and change in orientation with respect to gravity (tilt/roll) conducted upon return to Earth (Boyle et al. 2001). The response sensitivity was elevated on average by a factor of 3, with some afferents showing a saturating firing rate modulation for a ±1 Hz sinusoidal translational acceleration as remarkably low as ±0.0026g or about 0.25 mm half of peak-to-peak displacement. This extraordinary hypersensitivity persisted for the first day after landing, and then returned to within normal levels on the second day at 1G. The time course of return to normal response sensitivity closely paralleled the reported decrease in vestibular disorientation in astronauts following return to 1G after a comparable stay in space (Reschke et al., 1994). It is assumed that otolith structure is arranged for optimal responses in 1G, and that exposure of the animal to weightlessness led to a rapid adaptive response of its afferent sensitivity in an effort to restore normal sensory function. These adaptive mechanisms, revealed by tracking the re-adaptation processes upon return, were not subtle but dramatic and thus make the toadfish a suitable model to explore the influence of gravity on sensory processing in a vertebrate species. The initial results of an upregulation of a key component of the animal’s response to acceleration forced us to validate the observed hypersensitivity by following its return to normal values. As a result we could not jeopardize the finding prematurely by terminating the few flight animals to conduct a morphological study of the labyrinth. Because of the short durations of the space missions, we dismissed the possibility of structural changes of the otolith mass, transducer alterations, or an afferent dendritic reorganization as responsible for the functional changes in afferent sensitivity. Further, the afferents did not exhibit any unusual nonlinearities or distortion of discharge or an aberration in the tight directionality of their response. Ross (1993, 1994, 2000) found that the number of synaptic ribbons in rat type II otolith hair cells increased 2- to 3- fold following exposure to weightlessness. Since toadfish possess only type II hair cells, the more attractive interpretation of our afferent data was an increase in synaptic strength as the initial adaptive response to restore the “lost” gravity detection and a deletion of the added synaptic bodies (Waites et al., 2005; Matthews & Fuchs, 2010) leading to a restoration of normal sensation after a return to 1G. At present the neural adaptive mechanisms have been studied experimentally for relatively short stays in an altered gravity environment. We do not have yet information on the adaptive (or maladaptive) or compensatory mechanisms of gravity sensation as a consequence of longer periods of habitation in such adverse environments, but it is reasonable to assume that structural changes in the labyrinth might occur. This present study was motivated by the possibility of a synaptic reorganization of the utricle during future long-duration space missions. Among the large number of teleost species studied the utricular otolith mass shows the most structural homogeneity, as compared to the more diverse masses in the saccule and lagena (Popper & Hoxter, 1981; Lanford et al., 2000; Assis, 2005; Nolf, 2013), implying a highly conserved general morphology (Popper and Platt, 1993). Despite this homogeneity, there are large variations in the otolith mass among fishes (Lychakov et al., 2006), and this mass may vary over the lifetime of the animal (Lychakov & Rebane, 2005) and vary with the chemical composition of the endolymph (Romenek & Gauldie, 1996). The use of changes in absolute gravity levels and transitions between gravity states are powerful tools to identify the mechanisms of the gravi-sensing system development and function in normal and abnormal (e.g. disease, space) conditions. During the first days of spaceflight, most astronauts experience symptoms of space motion sickness (Reschke et al., 1994). It has been proposed that the naturally occurring asymmetry between the left and right otolith organs, compensated under normal conditions, manifests itself during the abrupt exposure to weightlessness and the extent of this asymmetry contributes to an astronaut’s individual susceptibility. Anken and coworkers (Anken & Rahmann, 1999; Anken et al., 2000a, b) have provided compelling evidence that the gravitational environment of the fish guides the growth of the otolith mass, particularly its size and asymmetry. Kondrachuk and Boyle (2006) reviewed the changes of otolith mass during the otolith development in altered gravity in mollusks and fishes as well as the growth of otoliths in fishes in normal conditions. A popular hypothesis says that regulation of growth of the single otolith in fishes, namely the test mass upon which gravity and linear acceleration act, is based on the weight of the mass. Thus, a larger-than-normal mass should be produced in a reduced-G environment and a smaller-than-normal mass would be produced in hyper-G. Such reaction of a gravi-sensing system to the change of gravity would imply the existence of a feedback mechanism. Despite the attractiveness of this hypothesis, the experimental results so far have not led to a clear interpretation, and made more complex by the likelihood of multiple feedback loops: a local mechanism of self-regulation and specific for the initial period of development when the neural connections are not established and a feedback mechanism related to neural self-regulation and specific for later stages of growth. A change in elemental composition of the otolith mass (see Fig. 3) as result of exposure to altered gravity might support a local feedback mechanism. The selection of the experimental model organism is relevant to settle the argument. Bottom dwelling and littoral fishes possess otolith organs that are better tuned to varying accelerations and more sensitive to low accelerations than pelagic fishes that are adapted to a more limited range of accelerations (Lychakov & Rebane, 2000). The transformation of an applied head acceleration into the electrical response of the hair bundle in situ is a complex coupling of the otolith membrane and otolith mass and the gel layer that surrounds the bundles, akin to the movable gelatinous septum, the cupula, into which the canal hair bundles penetrate. Grant and colleagues (Grant & Cotton, 1990–1991; Grant et al., 1994) and Kondrachuk (2002) have analyzed these interactions using analytical methods and the Kelvin-Voight viscoelastic model of the gel layer/otolith membrane to examine the transfer of mechanical input to the hair cell bundle. Although precise physical constants are difficult to obtain, there are likely functional consequences that vary among vertebrates due the interaction(s) between the viscous endolymph, inhomogeneous and isotropic gel material, and the otolith membrane and the heights and distribution of the hair bundles. A feedback mechanism controlling utricular function has the efferent vestibular system as an obvious candidate. Efferent innervation from axons of neurons originating in the brainstem of the vestibular sensory structures is a common feature in vertebrates (e.g. Fernández and Lindsay, 1963; Fujino et al., 1993; Klinke & Galley, 1974; Marco et al., 1990; Rossi, 1964; Valli et al., 1986). Similar to the squirrel monkey (Goldberg & Fernández, 1980), efferent innervation is mainly a mixture of inhibition of the hair cell membrane potential and excitation of the vestibular nerve afferent discharge (Boyle & Highstein, 1990). Boyle et al. (2009) recently showed in toadfish that efferent activation produced a slowly developing hyperpolarization, an increased somatic conductance, and a reduced receptor potential in semicircular canal hair cells, and these responses often outlasted the termination of the stimulus. Because of these actions, the efferent vestibular system can exert a powerful influence on the sensitivity of angular motion sensation by the semicircular canals. We made an effort in most cases during examination of synaptic connectivity at the transmission electron microscopy level to characterize in greater detail the efferent innervation of the macula. In these cases sections were relatively thick at ~180 nm to facilitate reconstruction of the dendritic processes and the tissue was subjected to avidin-biotin complex procedures to visualize the labeling. As a result, the quality of the images was not optimized to reveal the subsynaptic cisternae in the hair cells and the opposing efferent axon. In several cases thin sections of ~80–90 nm were collected to specifically focus on the efferent organization. However, we were not able to estimate the extent of the efferent innervation to the various regions of the utricle. In our recordings of utricular afferents to controlled accelerations we often found it difficult to evoke a response using efferent stimulation. Responses were readily evoked in horizontal canal afferents in the same preparation, suggesting the efferent innervation to the utricle is considerably weaker than in the canals or efferent neurons are more segregated from each other based on their projections. Not unexpected the organization of the toadfish utricle is similar in the broad sense to other species, including amniote and other anamniote species. Like the otolith structures in other species the hair cell polarization in toadfish is highly organized across the more 2D surface of the macula, with the only deviation from this arrangement found in the lacinium where hair cells reside on a relatively steep slope and their morphological polarizations run parallel, not orthogonal, to the reversal line. The polarity of bundles in utricular hair cells in a similar, although medially located, strip in pigeon also run parallel (Si et al., 2003), implying a common feature of vertebrates possessing this hair cell region in non-mammalian species. Hair cell density deviates in three visibly distinct zones. The densest zone is the narrow lateral extra-striola, followed by the medial extra-striola that represents the largest area of the epithelium at ~75% of the macula, and the least populated region is the striola on either side of the reversal line. The narrow lateral extra-striola region is a common feature of fishes (Platt, 1977), amphibians (Baird and Schuff, 1994), and birds (Si et al. 2003), but not mammals (Fernández et al., 1990, 1995). Hair cells also differ in the number of synaptic bodies they possess. Hair cells in the medial extra-striola have about 50% more synaptic bodies than their counterparts in the striola. Differences in hair cell density in striola and extra-striola are a common feature among the vertebrates studied, such as squirrel monkey (Li et al., 2008; Lysakowski & Goldberg, 2008), a wide variety of rodents (Desai et al. 2005), and turtle (Severinsen et al., 2003), and the quantitatively smaller cross-sectional area of the striola with respect to the extra-striola also contains a lower hair cell density. The relatively higher density in hair cells in the lateral extra-striola appears to be more typical in fishes (Platt, 1977). The utricles of fishes (Wersäll, 1961) and amphibians (Wersäll et al., 1965) possess only the cylindrical type II hair cells, where the maculae in reptiles (Schessel et al., 1991; Huwe et al., 2015), birds (Vinniko et al., 1965; Si et al., 2003), and mammals (Lindeman, 1969; Fernández et al., 1990) have a more complex striola and extra-striolar regions containing both the type II as well as the flask-shaped type I hair cells. The variation in afferent innervation patterns across the species reflects the differences in distribution of the hair cells to the specific macula. The complexity of the dendritic trees differs among vestibular nerve afferents supplying the three regions of the macula. Afferent contacting hair cells in the medial extra-striola have the greatest level of branching, specializations, and complexity, and those targeting striolar hair cells have the simplest patterns, and those supplying the lateral extra-striola have an intermediate level of complexity. The dendritic organization of afferents supplying the horizontal crista in toadfish is more complex and with broader receptive fields than observed in the utricle (Boyle et al., 1991). The complexity of the afferent’s dendritic structure was examined in another otolith organ, the saccule, of the toadfish and matched to its auditory physiological and directional response properties by Edds-Walton and colleagues (1999). Of particular note saccular afferents were found to possess between 7–111 terminal points per afferent in comparison to considerably fewer (1–35) terminals points in their utricular counterpart in the same species. Interestingly, no correlation was found between number of terminal points and response thresholds of saccular afferents (Edds-Walton et al., 1999), unlike a positive correlation found in toadfish canal afferents (Boyle et al., 1991). Although the pigeon has otolith afferents supplying calyx-only type I hair cells and dimorphic patterns contacting both type I and II hair cells, those possessing bouton-only structure to type II hair cells have vastly more elaborate and broader dendritic patterns in the utricle (Si et al., 2003), the saccule (Zahir et al., 2003), and the lagena (Zahir et al., 2012). The synaptic specializations of afferents to the medial extra-striola exhibit contacts not only to the basal and basolateral borders of the hair cells, but also extend along the lateral wall towards the apical surface. In all regions afferents typically follow a “beam” of hair cells with like polarities, thereby providing them with highly directional tuning properties. Determining the precise signals originating from the different regions of the utricular macula and how these signals enter the central reflex pathways to effect the vestibular control of orientation and motor control have been a challenge. The results obtained using whole nerve electrical stimulation, or even pulses applied to separated bundles, are difficult to interpret in large part due to the variation in polarization of hair cells. Goldberg et al. (1990) found about three-fourths the number of recorded utricular afferents in the chinchilla displayed a regular discharge of their interspike intervals. Since the extra-striola comprises about three-fourths the total area of the macula in this species, it is reasoned that regularly discharging afferents make up a large percentage of the output from this region. Like the chinchilla, the medial extra-striola in the toadfish occupies about three-fourths the total area of the macula. Using an intracellular paradigm to evaluate the synaptic inputs to central vestibular neurons identified by their projection(s) in the squirrel monkey, Boyle et al. (1992) found inputs arising from regular afferents predominated in vestibuloocular-collic cells and medial vestibulospinal tract neurons to the lower cervical segments, and contribute to the other projections. An attractive hypothesis is that the vestibular nerve afferent inputs are matched to the dynamic requirements of the various reflexes they target, such as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the medial and lateral vestibulospinal reflexes controlling to the upper and lower cervical and the lumbosacral reflexes, respectively. In this scheme the regular afferents are best matched to the control requirements of the linear VOR and provide the prime tonic input to spinal motoneurons (vestibular tonus) to augment motor responses. A clever approach to understanding the external forces driving the otolith signals from the macula is a numerical analysis conducted by Jaeger and Haslwanter (2004). They incorporated displacements of the gel/mesh layer boundary, the polarization vectors of the hair cells, the 3D curvature of the macula, and transfer functions of otolith afferents from Goldberg et al. (1990) to calculate the time-dependent responses along the macula, with special attention to the striola, for simulated head tilts from pitch to roll. Since the medial extra-striola region in vertebrate species comprises the largest portion of the macula, dynamic roll and static displacements of ipsilateral ear down were most prevalent and effective in the output of their model. Further, within the flat, more 2-D, regions of the macula the calculated response patterns of the two sublayers of the otolith membrane, modeled by others (Grant & Cotton, 1990; Grant et al., 1994; Kondrachuk, 2002), adequately described the movement characteristics of the gel layer for head tilts, and thus viscous forces from the endolymph there likely play a minor role in otolith mechanics during normal head movements. In the model the local effects due to the 3-D curvature of the macula are best seen in the striola. Afferents displaying more transient, tonic-phasic response characteristics reside in this narrow region (Goldberg et al., 1990) that reflect a mixture of tonic and phasic components for the initial dynamic responses that decay to a tonic state corresponding to the new head position. Afferents innervating the extrastriolar regions typically exhibit more less transient, tonic responses to acceleration (Goldberg et al., 1990). On a functional basis if we assume that the quantity of en passant specializations are directly proportional to terminal fiber length, one may speculate which regions of the utricular macula are most sensitive to vestibular stimuli. In the current study, a high degree of intra-regional variability resulted in large standard deviation values for the morphological parameters studied; however, range values indicated which regions of the macula contained afferents with extreme morphological traits. The longest, most voluminous otolith afferent, with the greatest number of nodes per fiber and bouton terminals was found in the medial extra-striola macula. It remains to be determined whether or not afferents supplying the medial macula are indeed more sensitive to vestibular stimuli than the striolar region and the lateral extra-striolar macula. However, the finding presented in Fig. 10 puts a twist to the assumption that only the terminal specializations of the afferent are linked to synaptic bodies in hair cells along the dendrite’s course. Synaptic bodies were observed associated with the afferent dendrite in the absence of any specialization. Despite the fact that the labeling process degrades the tissue and collecting thin section (<90 nm in thickness) is too risky, the use of biocytin labeling of the afferent combined with the serial reconstruction of the corresponding hair cells at the transmission electron microscopic level (180 nm thick sections) allowed validation of this unexpected linkage. The synaptic bodies were present and consistent in 3 consecutive sections. It is unclear how prevalent these “hidden” synaptic linkages in the macula occur, and thus at this stage caution is needed in correlating response sensitivity of the afferent with the number of its dendritic specializations. To study in detail the synaptic organization of a single afferent with its associated hair cells, we intracellularly injected the individual afferent to prevent mistaken identity or overlap with any neighboring branches of other afferents. This afferent supplied the medial extra-striolar macula. Although we have only one example due to the extremely time-consuming effort of serially reconstructing hair cells at the transmission electron microscopic level to fully characterize their synaptic body content (> 6 months to complete), the finding was particularly revealing: of the 12 hair cells serially reconstructed, all the synaptic bodies within 11 of them were associated with the labeled afferent, and the lone exception was a hair cell that provided half (5/10) of its synaptic bodies to the labeled afferent and the other half (5/10) to an unidentified branch. This implies a highly structured organization with equally highly specific targeting of afferent processes. In summary, this study has presented several of the benchmarks needed to evaluate this sensory organ’s response to the altered gravity likely experienced in deep space exploratory missions. However, even more key benchmarks remain to be validated. A useful description of utricle organization is based on zones of the macula, a thin strip on the outer border (lateral extra-striola), the neighboring zone in which a reversal of hair bundle polarization occurs (striola), and largest zone stretching to the medial wall of the organ. Hair cells vary in density on the macula, and the primary afferents innervating these zones, although varying widely in structural parameters such as dendritic volume and terminal specializations, show general trends in complexity of structure. It is unknown whether hair cell density or the afferent’s dendritic structure are modifiable by external forces acting on the animal as a means to regulate gain or bandwidth of response. The otolith mass continues to grow in fish, and recently a decreased calcification was observed in the freshwater zebrafish otolith mass due to exposure to hypergravity (Aceto et al., 2015). The toadfish’s otolith mass is suitably positioned to permit non-invasive imaging over extended periods of time. A tight coupling between the hair cells and afferents is seen: afferents target subsets of hair cells and the contacted hair cell distributes all or nearly all of its synaptic bodies to one afferent. Although the experiment has yet to be performed, the hair cell-afferent organization provides an opportunity to directly match the structural complexity of the utricle and richness of response signals carried by its afferents.",

Copyright notice ID: 5899691 MSID: MS949763 PMID: 29524209 The publisher's version of this article is available at J Comp Neurol Abstract The utricle provides the vestibular reflex pathways with the sensory codes of inertial acceleration of self motion and head orientation with respect to gravity to control balance and equilibrium. Here we present an anatomical description of this structure in the adult oyster toadfish, and establish a morphological basis for interpretation of subsequent functional studies. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize otolith mass and morphological polarization patterns of hair cells. Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology with respect to epithelial location. Transmission electron micrographs were compiled to create a serial 3-D reconstruction of a labeled afferent over a segment of its dendritic field and to examine the cell-afferent synaptic contacts. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically directed towards a limited number of 7–13 hair cells, but larger dendritic fields in the medial extra-striola can be associated with > 20 hair cells also; and hair cell synaptic bodies can be confined to only an individual afferent or can synapse upon several afferents.

Microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization in toadfish. Introduction Vertebrates possess a highly conserved and elaborate gravito-inertial sensing system in the inner ear. This system comprises two otolith organs, the utricle and saccule, in mammals with the exception of monotremes. A third otolith organ, the lagena, is present in fishes but absent in marsupials and eutherian mammals. Comparative data link the first sensory detectors of the ear primarily to a grouping of hair cells within a simple graviceptive statocyst (Budelmann, 1988) from which the vertebrate inner ear probably evolved (Fritsch et al., 2007). Structurally, the otolith organs consist of layers of neural and non-neural elements. Supporting cells and ciliated hair cells populate the neurosensory epithelium, the “spot” or macula; and the kino- and stereocilia of bundles extending from the apical surface of hair cells are covered with the non-neural gelatinous and fibrous otolith membrane layers (Lim, 1973; Lins et al., 2000; Sokolowski, 1986). Attached to this dense filament matrix are the weight-lending otoconia (grains) or a singular otolith (stone) in fishes. The loose aggregate of the otoconial mass of sharks and rays appears to present a transition to the rigid polycrystalline otolith found in teleosts (Gauldie, 1996). Otoconia are biomineral crystalline deposits of calcium carbonate organized in a calcite lattice in birds and mammals; aragonite is the predominant polymorph in fishes, amphibians and reptiles (Wang et al., 1998). The utricle lies primarily in the horizontal plane and senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation in the forward-backward and left-right directions (or any combination therein) and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. When the head rapidly moves, inertia causes the otolith mass to “lag” behind the sensory epithelium and this force is transmitted to the stereocilia bundle by way of lateral cross-links between the apex of the kinocilium and otolith membrane (Eatock et al., 1987). For slow movement (tilt), the heavier otolith follows the force vector of gravity. Hair cells are directional mechanosensors, and the resulting bending of their hair bundles begins the transduction cascade that transforms the vector sum of the imposing accelerations into a neural code (Hudspeth & Corey, 1977). The hair cell polarities (Flock, 1964; Maklad et al., 2010) and their coordinated distribution (Sienknecht et al., 2014) on the utricular epithelium ensure that all movements in the horizontal plane are adequately sensed, and the vector of stimulation by particle motion in both the horizontal and vertical planes is encoded by the range of hair cell orientations on the saccule of the toadfish (Edds-Walton & Fay, 2002). In humans, primary afferents innervating the otolith organs carry their constructed vector code in the form of modulated spacing of action potentials to the vestibular nuclei and cerebellum. There it is combined with angular motion signals obtained from the semicircular canals and with sensory cues derived from the visual, proprioceptive, tactile, cognitive and visceral systems to compute a central representation of the body and its parts as well as their dynamics in space. This representation is called the gravito-inertial vector (see Merfeld et al., 1999) and is an important transformation that the brain constructs to resolve the ambiguity of gravity and self-motion and thereby maintain balance and equilibrium under varying conditions in healthy individuals. The utricle can be adversely affected by trauma and disease and is directly implicated in space motion sickness and disorientation during space missions (Reschke et al. 1994) and readaptation upon return to Earth’s 1g (Boyle et al., 2001). The structural organization of the sensory epithelia and the otoliths have been studied in species of fishes (Dale, 1976; Flock, 1964; Hama, 1969; Popper, 1976, 1977, 1978; Platt, 1977, 1983; Dunkelberger et al., 1980; Jenkins, 1981; Chang et al., 1992; Lu & Popper, 1998; Platt et al., 2004; Popper & Lu, 2000; Buran et al., 2005; Lovell et al., 2006; Schulz-Mirbach et al., 2011), including toadfish (Sokolowski & Popper, 1987, 1988), and also in amphibians (Kachar et al., 1990; Kurc et al., 1999), retiles (Xue & Peterson, 2006), birds (Si et al., 2003; Dickman et al., 2004; Zahir et al., 2012), and mammals (Lim, 1984; Yaku et al., 1989; Lins et al., 2000; Desai et al., 2005). The development and evolution of the inner ear sensory epithelia and their innervation patterns has been extensively investigated by Fritzsch and co-workers (Fritzsch et al., 2002, 2007; Duncan & Fritzsch, 2012; Beisel et al., 2005) and Streit (2001; Lleras-Forero & Streit, 2012) and recently reviewed by Manley et al. (2013) and Friedman & Giles, 2017), and provide insights into the molecular and structural commonality and diversity found in the animal phyla. The aim of the present study is to describe the structure of the utricle in the adult oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, as a model vertebrate species. As noted by Sokolowski & Popper (1988) the vestibular epithelium of adult Opsanus is not an oddity, but is similar in both gross and fine structure to that of many other fishes except the herring (Popper & Platt, 1979). The toadfish is noted for its survivability in harsh environments, such as extended exposure to cold climate or even stasis, its longevity (>40 years), its low food demands, and this vertebrate species’ neural response to altered gravity that likely mimics that of man (Boyle et al., 2001). Our knowledge of the consequences of long duration space on human health is inferential. We have no biological sample return of any vertebrate species exposed to deep space upon which to analyze, evaluate, model and predict the outcome of the mission. An essential goal here is to provide the framework of the inherent design of the hair cell and afferent organization schemes in this animal to serve as the morphological basis for concurrent and subsequent studies of the physiological responses of the otolith organ under normal and novel gravitational conditions.Methods All procedures followed the principles of laboratory animal care set forth by the National Institutes of Health “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (National Academy Press) and approved by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult oyster toadfish, (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=8068) Opsanus tau, of both sexes and weighing ~400 gm were provided by the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA) and shipped overnight to NASA Ames Research Center. Fish were temporarily housed in several complete self-contained, controlled 300L seawater aquaria systems (Aqua Logic, Inc.; San Diego, CA) and monitored daily by the Animal Care Facility. In all experiments, fish were first immersed in MS222 (25 mg/l, 3-Aminobenzoic Acid Ethyl Ester; Sigma Cat# E10521) diluted in seawater, and relaxed by an intramuscular injection of pancuronium bromide (0.05 mg/kg); pancuronium bromide does not block opercular motion and allows for natural respiration. The fish were then cranially immobilized with stainless steel pins in a plastic tank filled with fresh, chilled (15° C) seawater covering all but the dorsal surface of the animal. The eyes and remainder of the body were kept covered with moist tissues. Seawater was aerated using an air stone. A small craniotomy was made to allow direct access to the right superior division of the vestibular nerve from the brain to the structures it supplies, namely the anterior and horizontal semicircular canals and the utricle. Fluorocarbon (FC-75; 3M Corp, Minneapolis, MN) was injected into the cranial opening to create a fluid barrier, help maintain oxygenation of the perilymphatic vestibule, and aid in visualizing structures of interest. Neuronal Labeling and Microscopy To bulk label afferent projections to the utricle the utricular nerve was isolated from the canal nerves using Parafilm®M and biocytin crystals (Sigma B4261) were inserted directly into multiple areas of the nerve near the macula using the tip of a glass micropipette. The opening was temporarily closed using sutures and the fish was allowed to survive for 12–18 hrs. To intracellularly label individual afferents, conventional borosilicate glass microelectrodes filled with a 2% solution of biocytin (Molecular Probes; Cat# B-1592) in 2 M LiCl2 and buffered (pH 7.2) with a dc impedance of 40–100 MΩ were inserted into the utricular nerve near the macula. Axonal penetration was signaled by a −40 to −60 mV resting potential that stabilized after several seconds. The axon was labeled by passing positive current pulses of 10–20 nA (1/sec 80% duty cycle) for 2–10 min through the electrode. To fix the macula for microscopy a small opening was made in the dorsalmost aspect of the anterior semicircular canal midway between the ampulla and common crus, and a glass pipette with ~50μm opening was inserted into its lumen directed rostrally towards the anterior ampulla. The pipette was attached to a 1 ml syringe, and the utricular endolymph was first gently flushed with 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and replaced with fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in buffer for light and scanning electron microscope imaging. In selected fish an alternative fixation solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sucrose and 0.2% picric acid in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was used for an ultrastructural study of the utricular macula using transmission electron microscopy. The perfusates in each case were colorized using alcion green to visualize the fluids flowing across the anterior ampulla, entering the utricular macular space and duct, and exiting via the common crus from the distal end of the cut canal limb. A heavy sedative dose of 0.5M MS222 was then placed in the tank for >5 minutes, the fish was removed, its heart was exposed, heparin (1 kU) was injected into the conus of the heart, and the fish was transcardially perfused with 500 ml cold heparinized toadfish Ringer solution followed by an equal volume of the particular fixative. The utricle and a portion of the nerve were extracted, together with the brain, and immersed in the same fixative. The utricular maculae were harvested and prepared for microscopic analysis of stained and unstained samples. Labeled processes were visualized using a protocol of VECTASTAIN ABC Staining Kit (RRID:AB_2336827 Vector Lab; Cat# PK-6100). Following overnight fixation the tissue was rinsed with 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB), immersed in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 hr, rinsed again, placed in a solution of 10 mL 0.1M PB and equal parts of ABC Vectastain solutions and 20 μL Triton X-100 for at least 3 hr, rinsed again, soaked in a 5 mL solution of a 3, 3′- diaminobenzidene (Sigma; Cat# 261890) and 0.12 gm nickel ammonium sulfate for 1 hr, to which 100 μL of 0.003% H2 O2 was added to the final step. For scanning electron microscopy (Leo 1450 Variable Pressure Secondary Electron) unstained samples were left in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate solution overnight, osmicated (2%), dehydrated in an ethanol series, critical point dried, mounted and sputter coated with gold/palladium. Light and transmission electron microscopy (Leo 912 AB) were used to evaluate both labeled and unstained samples. The utricle was post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide with 1.25% potassium ferrocyanide, en bloc stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 30% ethanol, rapidly dehydrated, infiltrated, and embedded in Epon. Blocks were serially sectioned using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome into 1μm survey sections for light microscopy and 180 nm thin sections for ultrastructure analysis. Digital mosaics of 100μm in length were captured at 5kX magnification with a side-mounted SIS MegaView III camera and assembled with AnalySIS® image analysis software. Mosaics assembled from every seventh section of the striolar and extra-striolar regions served as maps for tracking individually numbered hair cells in non-mosaic sections. Identified hair cells within each non-mosaic section were examined at 8kX magnification for the presence of synaptic bodies and hair cell afferent synapses. Images of candidate synaptic areas or unresolved cell membranes were captured at 12.5kX magnification to either confirm or refute synaptic bodies for data analysis and to discern cell membrane boundaries for serial reconstruction. Traced contours of selected objects in consecutive sections were then registered, smoothed, connected, and reassembled with NASA’s Reconstruction of Serial Sections (ROSS) software (Chimento et al., 1994; Montgomery, 1996). The ROSS software generates a surface mesh around completed contours which were then rendered in color-coded solid or semi-transparent form to view internal structures. Completed reconstructions were ported to a 3D viewing software to provide the best perspective of the image, saved in tiff format, and edited in RRID:SCR_014199 Adobe® Photoshop® for brightness and contrast. Measures are given in mean ± SD.Afferent Reconstruction and Analysis From a group of 18 toadfish utricles, two were selected for their superior staining quality to be reconstructed. Each tissue section was viewed under ×40 (Leitz Diaplan) magnification. The slides were mounted on a computer-motorized stage, which transmitted information to the software program RRID:SCR_001775 Neurolucida (MicroBrightField) for analysis. On each slide, contours were traced around the 1) the perimeter of the resin block in which the utricle was embedded, 2) the border of the basement membrane of the utricle, and 3) the border of overlying epithelium to the apical surface of the hair cells. The resulting contours on each section were used for standardization. Only the darkly labeled afferent and efferent processes were followed and traced throughout the sections. Afferents that were only partly stained or afferents that overlapped were discarded from analysis because they could not be discriminated with adequate certainty. Three-dimensional analysis was conducted after obtaining the process(es) tracing with the Neurolucida Explorer software program. A number of morphological parameters for each afferent was measured and quantified; axonal length, volume, number of nodes (branching points), and number of terminal boutons. Measures presented are given in mean ± SD.Results General Description of the Toadfish Utricle Figure 1 shows a micro-computed tomography scan (a) and a macroscopic view at the light level (b) of the left labyrinth and the 3 sensory epithelia supplied by the superior division of the vestibular (8th cranial) nerve (labeled from lateral to medial: Horizontal Canal (HC) nerve (n), Anterior Canal (AC) nerve (n), and Utricle (U) nerve (n)); in modern bony fishes the superior division also supplies the hair cells in the posterior semicircular canal ampulla. Individual utricular fibers were measured at the light microscopy level (40X oil magnification) in 6 fish where the AC and U nerves were clearly separate (see Fig. 1b), and their diameter averaged 5.4 ± 2.6 μm (SD; range 1.3 – 13.3 μm; n=1654). The utricle (U), with the anterior canal (AC) ampulla opening into its anterior end and the horizontal canal (HC) ampulla opening laterally (Fig. 1), and the saccule, together with the lagena as the third otolith structure located on its posterior end, make up the two main membranous compartments of the toadfish labyrinth. The utricle is essentially an elongated sac consisting of the utricular duct continuing anteriorly and widening to become the utricular recess. The posterior canal ampulla opens into the utricular duct posterior to the common crus of the vertical canals, which opens onto the upper middle surface of the utricular duct. The utricular recess is slightly concave and contains the utricular macula, with the main orientation of the macula in the plane of the horizontal canal (Fig. 2a). Since the sensory neuroepithelia are not encased in a bony labyrinth as in higher vertebrates, access to the separate nerves and epithelia is straightforward and under visual control. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Micro-computed tomography scan (a; 20 μm resolution) and a macroscopic view (b; light microscopy) of the anterior segment of the left vestibular labyrinth of the toadfish. Both images in panels a and b are similarly viewed from the top (dorsal), and their orientation with respect the head is given in panel a. The otolith mass was highlighted by false color in panel a. In panel b portions of the membranous labyrinth were removed to expose the cristae (arrows) of the horizontal (HC) and anterior (AC) canals and above the utricular (U) otolith mass. The vestibular nerve separates into individual branches indicated by colored arrows (HCn, ACn and Un) supplying each sensory structure.Figure 2. Open in a new tab a: Macroscopic view (SEM) of the left vestibular labyrinth. Orientation of image in panel a (dorsal view) is ~45° clockwise rotated with respect to panels a and b in Fig. 1 (as indicated). Labels the same as Fig. 1. The otolith mass was flipped horizontally off the utricular macula. The smooth ventral surface of the otolith mass covers the neurosensory epithelium. The two asterisks correspond to the 2 arrows in panel a of Fig. 4. b: Enlarged view of the more caudal-medial side of the ventral surface of the otolith mass shows the ragged and complex layered composition of the mass, presumably providing anchoring points to the vestibule. C: honeycomb remnants of otolith membrane on the ventral surface of the otolith.Otolith and Gel/Otolith Membrane In Fig. 2a the otolith mass was flipped horizontally to reveal its ventral surface facing the sensory macula. The smooth protuberance in the middle of the ventral surface of the otolith (gibbus maculae) lies above the hair cell zone of the macula (also see Fig.4a). Opposing this central portion of the otolith are two areas (shown in Fig. 2a and one is enlarged in Fig. 2b) of diverse structural organization (extremi) likely allowing greater adhesion to the utricular duct. While slight variations in otolith morphology were noted between samples (see Table 1), common characteristics predominated. The average dimension of the otolith is about 1.5 mm in length by 1 mm in width. The size of the otolith along its medial-lateral axis is about 2-fold greater than underlying sensory macula, but is only slightly greater along its anterior-posterior axis. The most uneven and irregular areas of the utricular otolith are located away from the AC and HC ampullae, and are not in close proximity to the neuroepithelium of the utricle or walls of the canal lumen. On average the otolith mass weighs ~2 mg. The elemental composition of the otolith was determined using energy dispersive X-ray spectral analysis (Fig. 3) and revealed an expected dominance by calcium (the highest calcium Ka peak, a smaller calcium Kb peak, and the very low calcium line at 0.34 KeV); traces of oxygen (O) and phosphorous (P), perhaps due to the naturally mineral form of calcium apatite – hydroxylapatite, were present. In contrast to the human otoconia atomic elements K, Na, Mg, S, and Cl, likely due to the protein nucleus in early development (Anniko et al., 1984), were not detected. No studies were done to reveal the organic components of the otolith mass. Figure 4.

GL that cover the apical hair cell surface to the ventral surface of the otolith mass is partially visible in this preparation. Arrows indicate the location of the two rough and jagged ends of the otolith mass after its removal, and correspond to the asterisks in panel a of Fig. 2 to illustrate how the otolith mass lies on the macula surface. Arrowheads mark the edge of the hair cell zone. White asterisk lies on the non-neural wall of the utricle near the horizontal ampulla and marks the location of the insert. Insert: higher magnification shows two (white arrowheads) of the numerous rod-like protuberances from the wall. b: Portion of the macula shows a region of exposed hair bundles devoid of GL (lower), another marginally covered immediately above the apical surface of the hair cells (center), and another region with the GL covering the hair bundle (arrowhead). c: Enlarged view of GL (arrowheads) in b. d: Layering of the OM (arrowheads) on top of the hair bundles in the third preparation.Table 1.

Open in a new tab Energy dispersive X-ray spectrum of utricular otolith (Hitachi S-4000 field emission SEM with a light element Noran X-ray detector); 2KX center technique: least squares fit. Highest calcium Ka peak, smaller calcium Kb peak, and the very low calcium line at 0.34 KeV were obtained. Elements present were Ca (20) and O (8). Atomic elements K, Na, Mg, S, and Cl were not detected.Between the otolith and the sensory epithelium is the fibrous layer comprised of an otolith membrane (OM) near the otolith mass and the gel layer (GL) beneath it closest to the apical surface of the hair cells. Because the composition of this layer, and particularly the GL in which the hair bundles penetrate, makes it vulnerable to fixation, only limited views of the layer are presented here. Patches of OM can be usually observed on the ventral surface of the otolith (Fig. 2a, c), often having a “honeycomb” appearance. In some cases the layer remained partially intact after processing. Examples are shown in Fig. 4. In panel a, the GL partially remains from the apical surface of the hair cells to below the tips of the hair bundles, exposing the topmost apex of the hair bundles; arrowheads mark the edge of the hair cell zone of the macula. The entire neuroepithelium, including the posterolateral subgroup of hair cells in the lacinium (highlighted in Fig. 5a, c), is covered by the GL. Comparing the OM attached to the otolith in Fig. 2a with the images in Fig. 4 confirms that the layer is not homogeneous in density (Sokolowski, 1986) and the GL immediately surrounding the hair bundle apex is more vulnerable to fixation (Johnsson & Hawkins, 1967; Nakai et al., 1996; Andrade et al., 2012). The arrowheads in Fig. 4a point toward the regions beneath the jagged ends of the otolith not covering the macula shown in Fig. 2 (asterisks in a). Rod-like protuberances (insert, white arrowheads) extend from the non-neural walls and likely help anchor the otolith to the non-neural epithelium (* in Fig. 4a) or fibrils interconnecting otoconia in mammals (Andrade et al., 2012). Figure 4b (and expanded portion in 4c) shows in a separate fish the apical surface of the hair cells mostly bare of the GL (lowest section), or matted by the GL (center section), or partially embedded in the GL (arrowheads, uppermost section). Fig. 4d shows a top down view of the macula in another fish to illustrate exposed hair cells, hair cells partially exposed with the honeycomb matrix, and fully covered by the layering of the OM. Figure 5. Open in a new tab SEM images of the left utricular macula. a: macroscopic view of the hair cell epithelium outlined in white and the reversal line within the striola marked by the yellow line. Representative morphological polarization of the hair bundle is marked by red arrows, with the arrow pointing towards the kinocilium. White arrow indicates the lacinium. Panel a corresponds to the light micrograph of Fig. 1b. Asterisk (white) within the macula approximates the enhanced view given in b. See text for a description of the hair cell density variation in these regions. b: Higher magnification of the hair cell zones under the anterior ampulla (AC) in a. The cyan lines estimated the three regions of the macula: the lateral extra-striola (upper section), the medial extra-striola (lower section), and the striola (center section). The yellow line within the striola was drawn to precisely indicate the reversal line where the hair cell bundle polarity shifts 180°. Note that the reversal line is not a smooth line, but shows some irregularity. The red arrows mark the direction of the hair cell bundle polarity. c: mosaic of the lacinium (or thumb) pointing towards the horizontal canal (HC). Hair cells reside on a relatively narrow and sloped surface of the macula. The reversal line is again drawn in yellow and marks the exact shift in hair cell bundle polarity. Note that the polarity of the hair bundles is now parallel to the reversal line with those on the top portion directed more medially and the on the bottom portion in the opposite sense (also indicated in panel a). Representative images of individual hair cells are shown in the inserts and yellow boxes mark their locations.Macula Organization The outline of the hair cell epithelium of the macula is drawn in white in Fig. 5a. The macula lies largely in a two-dimensional plane except in the anterior curvature beneath the anterior canal (AC) and the more three-dimensional thumb-like extension directed toward the horizontal canal (HC) called the lacinium (in more detail in Fig. 5c). The shape of the macula in toadfish resembles that of other vertebrates, such as frog (Baird & Schuff, 1994), pigeon (Si, 1999), and chinchilla (Fernández et al., 1990), with a short and long axes lying mostly in the horizontal plane of the head. More variation is found in the position of the striola. In mammals it is more centrally located (Li et al. 2008), whereas in frog, pigeon, and fishes (Flock & Duvall, 1965) the striola lies near the lateral border and spans nearly the entire length of the macula. The reversal line (estimated in yellow) is the point at which the morphological polarization of the hair bundle flips 180°. The morphological polarization of the hair bundle is given by the direction of the shortest stereocilia to the kinocilium (Flock, 1964) and defines the hair cell’s functional polarity (Hudspeth & Corey, 1977). As in the utricles of other species the kinocilium of opposing hair bundles face each other at reversal line in toadfish, except in the lacinium, and the red arrows show the hair bundle polarity at selected locations on the macula. In Fig. 5b a view of the macula ventrocaudal to the AC (marked by the * in a) is given to illustrate the three zones of the macula estimated by the cyan lines. Between the lateral (upper) and medial (lower) zones is the striola containing hair cells that straddle the reversal line (in yellow); here the reversal line is precisely drawn to split the hair cells with opposing hair bundle polarity. The lateral extra-striola macula is a relatively thin zone, but contains the highest density of hair cells/100μm (11.8 ± 1; n=189 in one count), whereas the medial extra-striola macula is the largest zone and its hair cell density/100μm in the same count (6.8 ± 0.2; n=106) is slightly greater to that in the least populated striola (5.5 ± 0.5; n=89); again, red arrows show the direction of the hair bundle polarity from the shortest to the kinocilium. Fig. 5c is a composite mosaic of SEM images taken in the lacinium. The reversal line (in yellow) splits the hair cells having opposing hair bundle polarization. The hair bundle polarities in the lacinia are not directed toward the reversal line as elsewhere but are orthogonal to the norm in the macula and run parallel to the reversal line; the inserts show an enlarged view of a representative hair cell in each of these opposing sections (each location is marked by a yellow box). The kinocilia of the hair bundles in the lacinia differ in length, resembling more canal hair bundles, than the shorter kinocilia found elsewhere in the utricle. The hair cells in this specialized region lie on a 45–60° slope, implying that hair cells respond more to angular roll on a steeply pitched plane of the head to right, contralateral, ear down in the rostral subdivision or to left, ipsilateral, ear down in the caudal subdivision. Further, since the anterior portion of the toadfish utricle curves dorsally and the striola crosses the mediolateral axis of the anterior macula, hair cells there should sense vertical acceleration when the head is in its normal posture. The anterior utricle of mammals also curves upward into the frontal plane of the head, but the striola is more centrally located.Utricular Afferent Organization in the Macula Despite the homogeneity of bouton-like afferent innervation of hair cells their dendritic morphology was not uniform. Three regions of the macula were differentiated into the striola, and the medial and lateral extra-striola macula. The photomicrographs of Fig, 6 (a–c) show labeled afferent processes in each of the three regions. The innervation patterns of 54 labeled primary utricular afferents are mapped in Fig. 7 and show marked differences in fiber length, fiber volume, nodes per fiber, and number of bouton terminals per fiber regionally (see Table 2) with all afferents terminating in bouton-like endings. There is a direct correlation of the afferent dendritic branching patterns and the density of the hair cells in the region they supply. Afferents with the greatest complexity supply the most densely populated medial extra-striola and those with the most simplistic dendritic trees supply the least populated striola; parameters in the lateral extra-striola fell in the middle. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Light microscopic images of biocytin-labeled afferent dendritic processes in the three hair cell zones of the macula. a: Afferents of the medial extra-striola macula have the more complex organization of their dendrites in the utricle, containing more branch points and processes that extend dorsally toward the more apical regions of the outer lateral membrane of hair cells (arrows). b: In the striola one utricular afferent is seen with a simplistic level of terminal arborizations. Presumed synaptic contacts occur at en passant swellings (arrows) along the extension of the afferent dendrite at the base of the hair cell somata layer. c: Afferents of the lateral extra-striola have a more moderate terminal arborizations complexity. Note the pseudocalyx specialization (arrow) in close proximity to the basolateral surface of hair cells. Abbreviations: BM, basement membrane; SC, layer containing the nuclei of supporting cells.

Morphological Parameters of 54 Primary Utricular Afferents Labeled by Biocytin and Grouped by Their Innervation to the Striola (n=17), Medial Extra-Striola (n=30), and Lateral Extra-Striola (n=7) Regions of Macula.

Fig. 6a shows the terminal endings of one afferent. Similar to other utricular afferents, the parent axon extends through the basement membrane and entered the basolateral surface of the neuroepithelium. These afferents produced numerous branch points in the hair cell (HC) zone of the macula. Whereas the dendrites of afferents supplying the striola were confined largely to the basal and basolateral regions of the hair cells, afferents supplying the medial extra-striola formed apparent synaptic contact sites also along the hair cell surface extending high up its lateral wall (arrows) above the basolateral area of the hair cell soma where the synaptic bodies are typically located (Eatock & Lysakowski, 2006). Huwe et al. (2015) found a similar finding in the turtle utricle and termed these dendritic spines. Thirty afferent fibers were reconstructed in the medial macula and are mapped in Fig. 7 and representative 4 fibers are given in Fig. 8a. The mean values for each of the morphological parameters in 30 afferents characterized in the medial extra-striola macula were the largest of the population (see Table 2). Despite the wide variability among afferent measures, afferents supplying this region contained, on average, the greatest complexity of dendritic structure with the greatest terminal fiber length (358 ± 244μm), the greatest terminal fiber volume (1239 ± 1400μm3), and the greatest number of nodes per fiber (7.6 ± 6.6), and bouton terminals (9.4 ± 7.5). Figure 8. Open in a new tab Selected reconstructions of labeled utricular afferent supplying hair cells in the medial extra-striola (a), striola (b), and lateral extra-striola (c) regions of the macula. In general afferents having the more complex dendritic arborizations supply the more densely populated medial extra-striola macula, those with an intermediate complexity supplied the lateral extra-striola macula, and those afferents with the simplest dendritic tress were found in the least populated striola.Striola The photomicrograph of Fig. 6b depicts the more simplistic morphological features of afferents supplying the striola. A single parent axon originating from the utricular nerve penetrates the basement membrane (BM) and enters the supporting cell (SC) layer of the macula. The afferent is likely to make synaptic contact onto the basal surfaces of multiple hair cells at en passant swellings (several are marked by black arrows) along the length of dendritic processes. The parent axon typically extends through the neuroepithelium unbranched and is directed along an axis nearly perpendicular to the reversal line of the macula (Fig. 7). Seventeen afferents in the striola were reconstructed and their positions on the utricular macula are shown in Fig. 7 (shaded area) and a selected 7 afferents in Fig. 8b. Although the number is low, an afferent’s dendritic tree was not seen to cross the reversal line. Afferents supplying the striola possessed the least complexity of their dendritic structure, containing the shortest terminal fiber length (166 ± 78 μm), the smallest terminal fiber volume (310 ± 317μm3), nodes per fiber (1.4 ± 1.7), and the least number of identified bouton terminals (2.5 ± 1.7) (Table 2).Lateral Extra-Striola The photomicrograph of Fig. 6c depicts several morphological features of afferents supplying the lateral extra-striolar macula, and the oddity of a pseudocalyx specialization (arrow). Again, the afferent penetrates the basement membrane and courses along the basolateral surface of hair cells. In this region of the macula, afferents display a few branches and showed an intermediate level of complexity of the dendritic structure. Seven afferent fibers were reconstructed in the lateral macula and are mapped in Fig. 7 and representative fibers are reconstructed in Fig. 8c. These afferents possessed a short terminal fiber length (166 ± 77Vm) similar to the afferents supplying the striola, a slightly larger terminal fiber volume (379 ± 163Vm3) than afferents supplying the striola, an intermediate numbers of nodes per fiber (3.1 ± 2.7) and number of bouton terminals (4.7 ± 2.7) (see Table 2).Synaptic Organization in the Macula Fig. 9 shows ultrastructure properties of the macula. Synaptic bodies (labeled SB in Fig. 9b and enlarged in Fig. 9c–e) lie within hair cells at the hair cell-afferent synapse. As in the other vestibular endorgans brainstem efferent neurons form synaptic contacts with both the hair cell (labeled E in panel b) and afferents (Fig. 10; for more details in the toadfish see Holstein et al., 2004). The number of synaptic bodies per 100μm × 100μm was determined by TEM using serial reconstruction from 180 nm (thickness) sections for two macular regions, one straddling the reversal line and the other 150 μm away in the medial extra-striola macula. On average each hair cell in the striola contains 4.65 ± 3.4 synaptic bodies (n=223, corresponding to 30 hair cells based on measured density) and its counterpart in the medial extra-striola area contains significantly more (6.92 ± 5.53; n=505, corresponding to 46 hair cells based on measured density) synaptic bodies (p<0.001; unpaired t-test for difference in mean, df=74). Typically, a single SB exists with a gap between adjacent ones, but doublets (Fig. 9c) are not uncommon, and multiple clusters (not shown) are occasionally observed. In Fig. 9d a biocytin-labeled afferent (dark structure in center) is synaptically coupled with two adjacent hair cells and in Fig. 9e an afferent process is sandwiched between SBs of two hair cells. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Synaptic organization of the toadfish utricle. Transmission electron microscopic images show the innervation patterns of hair cells’ synaptic bodies (SB) and afferent processes (a–e). a: Low magnification of the hair cell layer in the macula. Synaptic bodies within hair cells were identified at higher resolution and some are marked by red arrows on the internal wall along the basal and basolateral membrane of the hair cell (HC). Somata of hair cells are shown in the hair cell layer. Dorsal is upward, and remnants of several hair bundles are visible Two selected afferent dendritic processes are marked in blue, and a lone efferent terminal (E) is marked by the yellow arrow. b: Higher magnification of synaptic organization. As in the semicircular canal cristae of the toadfish labyrinth (Sans and Highstein, 1984; Holstein et al., 2004), efferent terminals (E in yellow) form synaptic complexes with hair cells (shown) and afferents (not shown here). Four synaptic bodies (SB) were identified by their halos of synaptic vesicles in this section, along with two separate afferent fibers. c: pair of synaptic bodies (red arrows) onto an afferent process in the medial extra-striola. Note the synaptic bodies are at the level of the hair cell nucleus (see Fig. 6b). d: a biocytin-labeled afferent process (A) is seen receiving synaptic contacts from adjacent hair cells. e: similar to d, an afferent process courses between two separate hair cells and receives synaptic contacts from each. The thickenings of the afferent’s subsynaptic membrane (marked with yellow arrows) are associated with the synaptic bodies (red arrows).Figure 10. Open in a new tab Presumptive efferent terminations on afferent dendrites in supporting cell (SC) layer. Processes in a and b were labeled with biocytin and their apparent synaptic specializations, such as en passant and terminal boutons (marked by yellow arrows), are seen in the neuroepithelial layer immediately dorsal to the basement membrane (BM) where the afferents lose their myelin and where hair cell (HC) somata are absent. Synaptic contacts of efferent axons onto supporting cells (SC) have not been reported, indicating axo-dendritic connections between efferent neurons and afferent dendrites. These presumed efferent processes were infrequently encountered. Scale bars, 5 μm.Two presumptive efferent axons labeled with biocytin are shown in Fig. 10 (a and b). The process in panel a is likely a terminal ending and that in panel B possesses en passant and terminal boutons (yellow arrows). In both cases the synaptic specializations are seen in the zone populated by the somata of supporting cells (SC) and the afferent dendrites between the basement membrane (BM), where the utricular afferent losses its myelin, and the hair cell (HC) soma layer. Since efferent axons have not been reported to innervate supporting cells, the highlighted processes likely represent axo-dendritic sites between efferent axons and afferent dendrites. It should be noted these indicators of efferent innervation were sought but infrequently encountered. An unexpected observation was made and is illustrated in Fig. 11. In panel a the principal dendrite of a biocytin-labeled afferent is seen coursing along the basal surfaces of the hair cells (somata in the Hair Cell Layer) above the nuclei of the supporting cell (SC) in the striola. Dorsal arrow marks a hair bundle above the apical surface of the hair cell. Double arrows point to the basement membrane (BM) of the neuroepithelium. Two distinct synaptic bodies were seen in the section (#19 of the series) outlined by the box and enlarged in Fig. 10b. The inserts show images of the synaptic bodies at the same magnification immediately before (#18) and immediately after (#20) the main section (#19). Of particular note is the absence of any terminal processes, such as synaptic varicosity (e.g. Fig. 6a) or a clear en passant bouton-like ending (e.g. Fig. 6b), on the afferent dendrite. To the extent that these type of synapses exist without an obvious afferent specialization is not known, but their existence has implications for understanding the functional organization of the macula. Figure 11. Open in a new tab Transmission electron photomicrographs shows the course of a biocytin-labeled utricular afferent in the macula between the supporting cell (SC) and hair cell layers (double arrows mark the basement membrane, BM) in the striolar region of the macula (hair bundle marked by a single arrow above the apical surface of a hair cell). a: section 19 of the serial reconstruction is a mosaic of the sensory epithelium taken at 5KX. Note that no clear dendritic specializations of the labeled afferent are evident. b: enlargement of the box in A. Two synaptic bodies are evident in this section, and were observed in the prior (sec18) and subsequent (sec20) sections overlaid as boxes. Of particular interest is that the synaptic areas were not associated with any apparent afferent specialization such as a bouton-like swelling.A 32D serial reconstruction of a biocytin-labeled utricular afferent is shown in Fig. 12 and highlights novel findings on hair cell-afferent organization. Ninety serial sections taken at 180 nm thickness were used to reconstruct the partial dendritic processes and hair cell contacts of this afferent at the TEM level. Labeled afferent is depicted in yellow, hair cell membranes are shaded in blue and green, hair cell nuclei are colored in dark blue and purple, and the hair cell synaptic bodies associated with the labeled afferent are shown as red spheres and those with other afferent processes are shown as green spheres. The uniqueness of this experiment is the observation that a given hair cell directs, in this example, virtually all of its synaptic bodies to one afferent. The afferent here exhibited dendritic varicosities, such as swellings, associated with synaptic bodies. Like elsewhere in the macula, the labeled afferent dendritic process followed a “beam” of hair cells that exclusively innervated it (8 SBs in hair cell in e; 9 SBs in hair cell in f). Eleven of the twelve reconstructed hair cells distributed their entire synaptic bodies to the labeled afferent. The sole hair cell exception is shown in h. The hair cell contained 10 synaptic bodies, 5 in contact with the labeled afferent and 5 onto a single and separate unlabeled (not reconstructed) afferent process. Figure 12. Open in a new tab 3D serial reconstruction of a biocytin-labeled utricular afferent and its synaptic relationship with the hair cells it contacted. Ninety serial sections taken at 180 nm were used to reconstruct the dendritic processes and hair cell contacts of this afferent at the TEM level. Labeled afferent is yellow, hair cell membranes are blue and green, hair cell nuclei are dark blue and purple, and hair cell synaptic bodies associated with the labeled afferent are red and those with other afferent processes are green. Panel a is an anterior view and b is a posterior view of the labeled afferent and its synaptic organization with hair cells. Twelve hair cells are reconstructed. White boxes represent enlargement in D. Inserts in a and b show two views of afferent’s dendritic tree and support the findings of Figs 6–10. Similar to afferents supplying the striola this labeled afferent had a limited branching pattern and tracked along the baso-lateral surfaces of the hair cells. The synaptic bodies in the hair cells are partially obscured by cell features, and were duplicated and placed in darkened regions in panels c–h. White arrows in panels c, d, e and h point the highlighted synaptic bodies to the afferent as a whole; the single white arrow in e points to mixture (red and green) of synaptic bodies and the synaptic body clusters (red) to the other two hair cells are copied and placed below the afferent for better visualization; the double set of white arrows in panels f and g point the highlighted synaptic bodies to the afferent separately as indicated. c: afferent is seen cupping two hair cells. d: cell on the far right appears to have only two synaptic bodies. As revealed by the mesh overlays in a and b, which show all synaptic bodies in the corresponding hair cells and the labeled afferent, two additional synaptic bodies are found in this hair cell as it drapes over the labeled afferent (white boxes). e: eight synaptic bodies can be seen in a single hair cell (far right) onto an individual afferent bouton. f: hair cell contains nine synaptic bodies, all in relation to the club-like ending of the labeled afferent. This is a common observation: the afferent follows a beam of hair cells that appear to exclusively target it. g: hair cell on left is an anterior view of the green hair cell in f, and hair cell on the right (white asterisk) is an anterior view of the green hair cell highlighted in h (asterisk). h: hair cell contains 10 synaptic bodies, 5 in contact with the labeled afferent and 5 onto a single and separate unlabeled process (not reconstructed in this figure).Discussion As a prelude to our efforts to understand the impact of normal and altered gravitational environment(s) on the neurovestibular system it is essential to provide a detailed description of the general morphology of the utricular otolith in our selected model, the toadfish, to establish the benchmarks for reference. For even relatively short exposures of 12–16 days in a near weightlessness environment aboard the shuttle orbiters (STS-90 and −95) the vestibular nerve afferents supplying the utricle of the toadfish underwent an enormous adjustment of their response sensitivity to an adequate inertial acceleration as revealed by physiological tests using controlled translational acceleration and change in orientation with respect to gravity (tilt/roll) conducted upon return to Earth (Boyle et al. 2001). The response sensitivity was elevated on average by a factor of 3, with some afferents showing a saturating firing rate modulation for a ±1 Hz sinusoidal translational acceleration as remarkably low as ±0.0026g or about 0.25 mm half of peak-to-peak displacement. This extraordinary hypersensitivity persisted for the first day after landing, and then returned to within normal levels on the second day at 1G. The time course of return to normal response sensitivity closely paralleled the reported decrease in vestibular disorientation in astronauts following return to 1G after a comparable stay in space (Reschke et al., 1994). It is assumed that otolith structure is arranged for optimal responses in 1G, and that exposure of the animal to weightlessness led to a rapid adaptive response of its afferent sensitivity in an effort to restore normal sensory function. These adaptive mechanisms, revealed by tracking the re-adaptation processes upon return, were not subtle but dramatic and thus make the toadfish a suitable model to explore the influence of gravity on sensory processing in a vertebrate species. The initial results of an upregulation of a key component of the animal’s response to acceleration forced us to validate the observed hypersensitivity by following its return to normal values. As a result we could not jeopardize the finding prematurely by terminating the few flight animals to conduct a morphological study of the labyrinth. Because of the short durations of the space missions, we dismissed the possibility of structural changes of the otolith mass, transducer alterations, or an afferent dendritic reorganization as responsible for the functional changes in afferent sensitivity. Further, the afferents did not exhibit any unusual nonlinearities or distortion of discharge or an aberration in the tight directionality of their response. Ross (1993, 1994, 2000) found that the number of synaptic ribbons in rat type II otolith hair cells increased 2- to 3- fold following exposure to weightlessness. Since toadfish possess only type II hair cells, the more attractive interpretation of our afferent data was an increase in synaptic strength as the initial adaptive response to restore the “lost” gravity detection and a deletion of the added synaptic bodies (Waites et al., 2005; Matthews & Fuchs, 2010) leading to a restoration of normal sensation after a return to 1G. At present the neural adaptive mechanisms have been studied experimentally for relatively short stays in an altered gravity environment. We do not have yet information on the adaptive (or maladaptive) or compensatory mechanisms of gravity sensation as a consequence of longer periods of habitation in such adverse environments, but it is reasonable to assume that structural changes in the labyrinth might occur. This present study was motivated by the possibility of a synaptic reorganization of the utricle during future long-duration space missions. Among the large number of teleost species studied the utricular otolith mass shows the most structural homogeneity, as compared to the more diverse masses in the saccule and lagena (Popper & Hoxter, 1981; Lanford et al., 2000; Assis, 2005; Nolf, 2013), implying a highly conserved general morphology (Popper and Platt, 1993). Despite this homogeneity, there are large variations in the otolith mass among fishes (Lychakov et al., 2006), and this mass may vary over the lifetime of the animal (Lychakov & Rebane, 2005) and vary with the chemical composition of the endolymph (Romenek & Gauldie, 1996). The use of changes in absolute gravity levels and transitions between gravity states are powerful tools to identify the mechanisms of the gravi-sensing system development and function in normal and abnormal (e.g. disease, space) conditions. During the first days of spaceflight, most astronauts experience symptoms of space motion sickness (Reschke et al., 1994). It has been proposed that the naturally occurring asymmetry between the left and right otolith organs, compensated under normal conditions, manifests itself during the abrupt exposure to weightlessness and the extent of this asymmetry contributes to an astronaut’s individual susceptibility. Anken and coworkers (Anken & Rahmann, 1999; Anken et al., 2000a, b) have provided compelling evidence that the gravitational environment of the fish guides the growth of the otolith mass, particularly its size and asymmetry. Kondrachuk and Boyle (2006) reviewed the changes of otolith mass during the otolith development in altered gravity in mollusks and fishes as well as the growth of otoliths in fishes in normal conditions. A popular hypothesis says that regulation of growth of the single otolith in fishes, namely the test mass upon which gravity and linear acceleration act, is based on the weight of the mass. Thus, a larger-than-normal mass should be produced in a reduced-G environment and a smaller-than-normal mass would be produced in hyper-G. Such reaction of a gravi-sensing system to the change of gravity would imply the existence of a feedback mechanism. Despite the attractiveness of this hypothesis, the experimental results so far have not led to a clear interpretation, and made more complex by the likelihood of multiple feedback loops: a local mechanism of self-regulation and specific for the initial period of development when the neural connections are not established and a feedback mechanism related to neural self-regulation and specific for later stages of growth. A change in elemental composition of the otolith mass (see Fig. 3) as result of exposure to altered gravity might support a local feedback mechanism. The selection of the experimental model organism is relevant to settle the argument. Bottom dwelling and littoral fishes possess otolith organs that are better tuned to varying accelerations and more sensitive to low accelerations than pelagic fishes that are adapted to a more limited range of accelerations (Lychakov & Rebane, 2000). The transformation of an applied head acceleration into the electrical response of the hair bundle in situ is a complex coupling of the otolith membrane and otolith mass and the gel layer that surrounds the bundles, akin to the movable gelatinous septum, the cupula, into which the canal hair bundles penetrate. Grant and colleagues (Grant & Cotton, 1990–1991; Grant et al., 1994) and Kondrachuk (2002) have analyzed these interactions using analytical methods and the Kelvin-Voight viscoelastic model of the gel layer/otolith membrane to examine the transfer of mechanical input to the hair cell bundle. Although precise physical constants are difficult to obtain, there are likely functional consequences that vary among vertebrates due the interaction(s) between the viscous endolymph, inhomogeneous and isotropic gel material, and the otolith membrane and the heights and distribution of the hair bundles. A feedback mechanism controlling utricular function has the efferent vestibular system as an obvious candidate. Efferent innervation from axons of neurons originating in the brainstem of the vestibular sensory structures is a common feature in vertebrates (e.g. Fernández and Lindsay, 1963; Fujino et al., 1993; Klinke & Galley, 1974; Marco et al., 1990; Rossi, 1964; Valli et al., 1986). Similar to the squirrel monkey (Goldberg & Fernández, 1980), efferent innervation is mainly a mixture of inhibition of the hair cell membrane potential and excitation of the vestibular nerve afferent discharge (Boyle & Highstein, 1990). Boyle et al. (2009) recently showed in toadfish that efferent activation produced a slowly developing hyperpolarization, an increased somatic conductance, and a reduced receptor potential in semicircular canal hair cells, and these responses often outlasted the termination of the stimulus. Because of these actions, the efferent vestibular system can exert a powerful influence on the sensitivity of angular motion sensation by the semicircular canals. We made an effort in most cases during examination of synaptic connectivity at the transmission electron microscopy level to characterize in greater detail the efferent innervation of the macula. In these cases sections were relatively thick at ~180 nm to facilitate reconstruction of the dendritic processes and the tissue was subjected to avidin-biotin complex procedures to visualize the labeling. As a result, the quality of the images was not optimized to reveal the subsynaptic cisternae in the hair cells and the opposing efferent axon. In several cases thin sections of ~80–90 nm were collected to specifically focus on the efferent organization. However, we were not able to estimate the extent of the efferent innervation to the various regions of the utricle. In our recordings of utricular afferents to controlled accelerations we often found it difficult to evoke a response using efferent stimulation. Responses were readily evoked in horizontal canal afferents in the same preparation, suggesting the efferent innervation to the utricle is considerably weaker than in the canals or efferent neurons are more segregated from each other based on their projections. Not unexpected the organization of the toadfish utricle is similar in the broad sense to other species, including amniote and other anamniote species. Like the otolith structures in other species the hair cell polarization in toadfish is highly organized across the more 2D surface of the macula, with the only deviation from this arrangement found in the lacinium where hair cells reside on a relatively steep slope and their morphological polarizations run parallel, not orthogonal, to the reversal line. The polarity of bundles in utricular hair cells in a similar, although medially located, strip in pigeon also run parallel (Si et al., 2003), implying a common feature of vertebrates possessing this hair cell region in non-mammalian species. Hair cell density deviates in three visibly distinct zones. The densest zone is the narrow lateral extra-striola, followed by the medial extra-striola that represents the largest area of the epithelium at ~75% of the macula, and the least populated region is the striola on either side of the reversal line. The narrow lateral extra-striola region is a common feature of fishes (Platt, 1977), amphibians (Baird and Schuff, 1994), and birds (Si et al. 2003), but not mammals (Fernández et al., 1990, 1995). Hair cells also differ in the number of synaptic bodies they possess. Hair cells in the medial extra-striola have about 50% more synaptic bodies than their counterparts in the striola. Differences in hair cell density in striola and extra-striola are a common feature among the vertebrates studied, such as squirrel monkey (Li et al., 2008; Lysakowski & Goldberg, 2008), a wide variety of rodents (Desai et al. 2005), and turtle (Severinsen et al., 2003), and the quantitatively smaller cross-sectional area of the striola with respect to the extra-striola also contains a lower hair cell density. The relatively higher density in hair cells in the lateral extra-striola appears to be more typical in fishes (Platt, 1977). The utricles of fishes (Wersäll, 1961) and amphibians (Wersäll et al., 1965) possess only the cylindrical type II hair cells, where the maculae in reptiles (Schessel et al., 1991; Huwe et al., 2015), birds (Vinniko et al., 1965; Si et al., 2003), and mammals (Lindeman, 1969; Fernández et al., 1990) have a more complex striola and extra-striolar regions containing both the type II as well as the flask-shaped type I hair cells. The variation in afferent innervation patterns across the species reflects the differences in distribution of the hair cells to the specific macula. The complexity of the dendritic trees differs among vestibular nerve afferents supplying the three regions of the macula. Afferent contacting hair cells in the medial extra-striola have the greatest level of branching, specializations, and complexity, and those targeting striolar hair cells have the simplest patterns, and those supplying the lateral extra-striola have an intermediate level of complexity. The dendritic organization of afferents supplying the horizontal crista in toadfish is more complex and with broader receptive fields than observed in the utricle (Boyle et al., 1991). The complexity of the afferent’s dendritic structure was examined in another otolith organ, the saccule, of the toadfish and matched to its auditory physiological and directional response properties by Edds-Walton and colleagues (1999). Of particular note saccular afferents were found to possess between 7–111 terminal points per afferent in comparison to considerably fewer (1–35) terminals points in their utricular counterpart in the same species. Interestingly, no correlation was found between number of terminal points and response thresholds of saccular afferents (Edds-Walton et al., 1999), unlike a positive correlation found in toadfish canal afferents (Boyle et al., 1991). Although the pigeon has otolith afferents supplying calyx-only type I hair cells and dimorphic patterns contacting both type I and II hair cells, those possessing bouton-only structure to type II hair cells have vastly more elaborate and broader dendritic patterns in the utricle (Si et al., 2003), the saccule (Zahir et al., 2003), and the lagena (Zahir et al., 2012). The synaptic specializations of afferents to the medial extra-striola exhibit contacts not only to the basal and basolateral borders of the hair cells, but also extend along the lateral wall towards the apical surface. In all regions afferents typically follow a “beam” of hair cells with like polarities, thereby providing them with highly directional tuning properties. Determining the precise signals originating from the different regions of the utricular macula and how these signals enter the central reflex pathways to effect the vestibular control of orientation and motor control have been a challenge. The results obtained using whole nerve electrical stimulation, or even pulses applied to separated bundles, are difficult to interpret in large part due to the variation in polarization of hair cells. Goldberg et al. (1990) found about three-fourths the number of recorded utricular afferents in the chinchilla displayed a regular discharge of their interspike intervals. Since the extra-striola comprises about three-fourths the total area of the macula in this species, it is reasoned that regularly discharging afferents make up a large percentage of the output from this region. Like the chinchilla, the medial extra-striola in the toadfish occupies about three-fourths the total area of the macula. Using an intracellular paradigm to evaluate the synaptic inputs to central vestibular neurons identified by their projection(s) in the squirrel monkey, Boyle et al. (1992) found inputs arising from regular afferents predominated in vestibuloocular-collic cells and medial vestibulospinal tract neurons to the lower cervical segments, and contribute to the other projections. An attractive hypothesis is that the vestibular nerve afferent inputs are matched to the dynamic requirements of the various reflexes they target, such as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the medial and lateral vestibulospinal reflexes controlling to the upper and lower cervical and the lumbosacral reflexes, respectively. In this scheme the regular afferents are best matched to the control requirements of the linear VOR and provide the prime tonic input to spinal motoneurons (vestibular tonus) to augment motor responses. A clever approach to understanding the external forces driving the otolith signals from the macula is a numerical analysis conducted by Jaeger and Haslwanter (2004). They incorporated displacements of the gel/mesh layer boundary, the polarization vectors of the hair cells, the 3D curvature of the macula, and transfer functions of otolith afferents from Goldberg et al. (1990) to calculate the time-dependent responses along the macula, with special attention to the striola, for simulated head tilts from pitch to roll. Since the medial extra-striola region in vertebrate species comprises the largest portion of the macula, dynamic roll and static displacements of ipsilateral ear down were most prevalent and effective in the output of their model. Further, within the flat, more 2-D, regions of the macula the calculated response patterns of the two sublayers of the otolith membrane, modeled by others (Grant & Cotton, 1990; Grant et al., 1994; Kondrachuk, 2002), adequately described the movement characteristics of the gel layer for head tilts, and thus viscous forces from the endolymph there likely play a minor role in otolith mechanics during normal head movements. In the model the local effects due to the 3-D curvature of the macula are best seen in the striola. Afferents displaying more transient, tonic-phasic response characteristics reside in this narrow region (Goldberg et al., 1990) that reflect a mixture of tonic and phasic components for the initial dynamic responses that decay to a tonic state corresponding to the new head position. Afferents innervating the extrastriolar regions typically exhibit more less transient, tonic responses to acceleration (Goldberg et al., 1990). On a functional basis if we assume that the quantity of en passant specializations are directly proportional to terminal fiber length, one may speculate which regions of the utricular macula are most sensitive to vestibular stimuli. In the current study, a high degree of intra-regional variability resulted in large standard deviation values for the morphological parameters studied; however, range values indicated which regions of the macula contained afferents with extreme morphological traits. The longest, most voluminous otolith afferent, with the greatest number of nodes per fiber and bouton terminals was found in the medial extra-striola macula. It remains to be determined whether or not afferents supplying the medial macula are indeed more sensitive to vestibular stimuli than the striolar region and the lateral extra-striolar macula. However, the finding presented in Fig. 10 puts a twist to the assumption that only the terminal specializations of the afferent are linked to synaptic bodies in hair cells along the dendrite’s course. Synaptic bodies were observed associated with the afferent dendrite in the absence of any specialization. Despite the fact that the labeling process degrades the tissue and collecting thin section (<90 nm in thickness) is too risky, the use of biocytin labeling of the afferent combined with the serial reconstruction of the corresponding hair cells at the transmission electron microscopic level (180 nm thick sections) allowed validation of this unexpected linkage. The synaptic bodies were present and consistent in 3 consecutive sections. It is unclear how prevalent these “hidden” synaptic linkages in the macula occur, and thus at this stage caution is needed in correlating response sensitivity of the afferent with the number of its dendritic specializations. To study in detail the synaptic organization of a single afferent with its associated hair cells, we intracellularly injected the individual afferent to prevent mistaken identity or overlap with any neighboring branches of other afferents. This afferent supplied the medial extra-striolar macula. Although we have only one example due to the extremely time-consuming effort of serially reconstructing hair cells at the transmission electron microscopic level to fully characterize their synaptic body content (> 6 months to complete), the finding was particularly revealing: of the 12 hair cells serially reconstructed, all the synaptic bodies within 11 of them were associated with the labeled afferent, and the lone exception was a hair cell that provided half (5/10) of its synaptic bodies to the labeled afferent and the other half (5/10) to an unidentified branch. This implies a highly structured organization with equally highly specific targeting of afferent processes. In summary, this study has presented several of the benchmarks needed to evaluate this sensory organ’s response to the altered gravity likely experienced in deep space exploratory missions. However, even more key benchmarks remain to be validated. A useful description of utricle organization is based on zones of the macula, a thin strip on the outer border (lateral extra-striola), the neighboring zone in which a reversal of hair bundle polarization occurs (striola), and largest zone stretching to the medial wall of the organ. Hair cells vary in density on the macula, and the primary afferents innervating these zones, although varying widely in structural parameters such as dendritic volume and terminal specializations, show general trends in complexity of structure. It is unknown whether hair cell density or the afferent’s dendritic structure are modifiable by external forces acting on the animal as a means to regulate gain or bandwidth of response. The otolith mass continues to grow in fish, and recently a decreased calcification was observed in the freshwater zebrafish otolith mass due to exposure to hypergravity (Aceto et al., 2015). The toadfish’s otolith mass is suitably positioned to permit non-invasive imaging over extended periods of time. A tight coupling between the hair cells and afferents is seen: afferents target subsets of hair cells and the contacted hair cell distributes all or nearly all of its synaptic bodies to one afferent. Although the experiment has yet to be performed, the hair cell-afferent organization provides an opportunity to directly match the structural complexity of the utricle and richness of response signals carried by its afferents.Acknowledgments We would like to gratefully acknowledge the funding from research grants /NIDCD (P01 DC01837) and NASA (03-OBPR-04 and 11_Omni_2-0002) to RB, the NASA Postdoctoral Program administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities (to YP), the Ames Associates Program (to RE and AM), and the support from the NASA Human Research and Space Biology Programs (to RB).

    "abstract": "Abstract Gravity has remained constant during animal evolution and the neural sensory systems detecting acceleration forces have remained remarkably conserved among vertebrates. The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound effects on how an organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1–32-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1–8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent vestibular pathway. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228°/s constant angular velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Afferents studied after 228°/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without centripetal acceleration, called On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their control counterparts. Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3–4 days followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after 16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the same fish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found. Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g resembles in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms.

    "introduction": "Introduction Gravity is a natural force that drives all living organisms to acquire precise physiological mechanisms to survive. Throughout the course of a species’ evolution the intensity and direction of gravity have remained constant, whereas other environmental factors, such as predation, climate, vegetation, for example, with rare exceptions have not. The highly evolved inner ear neural systems in vertebrates are keyed to operating under gravity’s continuous influence (Stensiö, 1927; Friedman and Giles, 2017). Detections of inertial acceleration, such as linear translation during self-motion or an external perturbation, and head orientation with respect to gravity, such as tilts, start from the bilateral otolith organs. The first vertebrate ear was principally a graviceptive statocyst more commonly found in today’s aquatic invertebrates (Budelmann, 1988). Otolith structures contain an inertial mass of calcium carbonate that is subject to the pull of gravity and thus possesses weight. In an earlier study (Boyle et al., 2001) fish were exposed to near weightlessness in spaceflight and in this study we exposed the fish to centrifugation to enhance the gravity load and queried in a similar fashion the sensory processing characteristics of otolith afferents. Pervasiveness of gravity provides the nervous system a common reference about which to optimize sensory transduction mechanisms and perception. Otolith afferents carry the transduced signal of the gravito-inertial forces in the form of modulated spacing of action potentials to the brainstem and cerebellum (see Goldberg et al., 2012). There the otolith code combines with angular acceleration signals obtained from the semicircular canals and with information derived from the visual and somesthetic modalities to compute a central representation of the body and its parts as well as their dynamics in space. The end result is the resolution of ambiguity of gravity and self-motion to allow healthy individuals to maintain balance and equilibrium under varying conditions. Despite invariability of gravity on Earth, physiological systems are not and are adversely affected by trauma, disease, and aging, and thus central creation of the gravito-inertial vector can be disrupted leading to vertigo, disorientation, and other clinical disorders. Arrival of aviation and space age offered a means to directly study the role of gravity in healthy subjects. The established reference of self-orientation is now completely violated by the speed at which the individual and visual world on the retina move and by rapidly changing orientation of the gravity vector with respect to the pilot, or removal of gravity vector altogether in space missions. During the first days of spaceflight, most astronauts experience symptoms of space motion sickness and disorientation (Reschke et al., 1994; Demontis et al., 2017) linked to the otolith organs (Watt et al., 1986; Paloski et al., 1993; Heer and Paloski, 2006). An extraordinary hypersensitivity to applied acceleration was observed in toadfish utricle afferents after relatively short mission aboard Shuttle orbiters (Boyle et al., 2001). The hypersensitivity presumably was the result of exposure to near weightlessness, persisted over the first day after landing, returned to within normal levels on the second day at 1 g, and closely matched the reported readaptation in astronauts after landing following a comparable stay in space (Reschke et al., 1994). Physiological adjustments to a novel gravity, as witnessed in spaceflight, reveal that the organism possesses adaptive mechanisms triggered by transitions in gravity. What initiates these mechanisms and are they compensatory to the gravity load? In addition to the sensory afferent pathways the brain in turn sends efferent signals back to the same inner ear structures. Activation of olivo-cochlear efferent neurons can attenuate afferent sensitivity and reduce its frequency selectivity or tuning to sound (Warr and Guinan, 1979; Liberman, 1980; Groff and Liberman, 2003). In functional terms, this efferent-to-afferent feedback loop adjusts sensitivity of hearing in a frequency dependent way (Brown et al., 1983; Russell and Murugasu, 1997). Analogous to the cochlea, efferent synaptic terminals contact both vestibular hair cells and afferents (Smith and Rasmussen, 1968; Sans and Highstein, 1984; Holstein et al., 2004; Lysakowski and Goldberg, 2008), and activation of efferent synapses influences afferent sensitivity in fish (Flock and Russell, 1976; Hartmann and Klinke, 1980; Boyle and Highstein, 1990b; Boyle et al., 2009), frog (Gribenski and Caston, 1976; Valli et al., 1986; Chagnaud et al., 2015), turtle (Brichta and Goldberg, 2000; Holt et al., 2006), bird (Dickman and Correia, 1992), chinchilla (Marlinski et al., 2004), and primates (Goldberg and Fernández, 1980; Sadeghi et al., 2009). Reflex or self-generated movements often have large purposeful acceleration components, such as those occurring during predation (attack) and avoidance (escape) behaviors that would impair the computation of a movement, and importantly any novel perturbations encountered during execution of those behaviors. To enable the afferent to continuously encode motion profiles during such overt behaviors its sensitivity to acceleration is reduced, often dramatically, but it is not clear whether the prevailing gravity load is registered by the efferent system and participates in adaptive processes. Another possible participant in adaptive processes in the peripheral labyrinth is a rapid addition or removal of synaptic bodies associated with the hair cell-afferent synapse. Ross (2000) found the number of synaptic ribbons in rat type II otolith hair cells increased two to threefold following 14-day exposure to weightlessness. Since toadfish possess only type II hair cells, an attractive interpretation of our earlier afferent data (Boyle et al., 2001) was an increase in synaptic strength as an initial adaptive response to restore the “lost” gravity detection, followed by a deletion of the added synaptic bodies (Waites et al., 2005; Matthews and Fuchs, 2010; Graydon et al., 2017) leading to a restoration of normal sensation after a return to 1 g. Here, we manipulate the afferent responses to acceleration by applying variable exposures to hypergravity (HG) via centrifugation and directly correlate the observed afferent sensitivity with serial reconstruction of hair cell-afferent complexes in two areas of the utricular macula in the same animal.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods General Procedures Oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, of either sex, weighing ∼400 g, were provided by the Resources Facilities of Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA, United States). Fish were housed in 300 l saltwater aquaria systems (AquaLogic, San Diego, CA, United States) and monitored daily by the veterinarian staff. All procedures followed the principles set forth by  “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Ed 8” and approved by NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Useful data were acquired from 106 fish. Immediately after removal from the centrifuge aquarium (<1 min) the fish was immersed in the anesthetic agent MS222 (25 mg/l, 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States) diluted in saltwater (Instant Ocean®). Fish was then placed in a Lexan polycarbonate tank filled with chilled (15°C) saltwater, and its head was stabilized in an Earth horizontal plane using a mouth brace and immobilized with stainless steel pins to the cranium; saltwater covered all but its most dorsal surface, and its eyes and dorsal fins were covered with moist tissues. Saltwater was aerated using an air stone. MS222 was added as needed during the course of the experiment. A small craniotomy was made to visualize the anterior and horizontal canal (HC) ampullae and the utricle and their specific nerve supply. Fluorocarbon (FC75, 3M Corp, Minneapolis, MN, United States) was injected into the cranial opening to fill the perilymphatic vestibule. The dorsal surfaces of the brainstem and posterior cerebellum were exposed by removing ∼3 mm2 portion of occiput above the foramen magnum. Efferent vestibular nuclei are seen as paramedial gray areas among the transversely running internal arcuate fibers under the floor of the IVth ventricle (Highstein and Baker, 1986). A pair of sharpened Ag/AgCl wires insulated to within 0.2 mm of their tips and spaced ∼2 mm was lowered into the efferent nuclei on either side of the midline along a ∼45° angle beneath the posterior cerebellum to a depth of 1–2 mm. EVS activation behaviorally provoked or electrically induced elicits an early arousal reaction, characterized by an initial flaring of lateral fins and raising of dorsal fin, followed by straightening of the tail and extension of the ventral fins (Highstein and Baker, 1985; Boyle and Highstein, 1990b). Fin flaring was used as a guide for proper placement of electrode array that required the lowest shock intensity. Alert fish activate their EVS at a maximum rate of ∼100 impulses/s (ips) (Highstein and Baker, 1985), and efferent nerves faithfully follow a 100 Hz stimulus train applied to the nuclei (Boyle and Highstein, 1990b). EVS stimulation consisted of single pulses of 100 μs duration with trains of 100/s were delivered in a bipolar fashion via a pulse generator coupled to a stimulus isolation unit and captured as time-stamped events in Spike2 (CED, United Kingdom). Conventional 30–50 MΩ glass microelectrodes, filled with 2 M LiCl2, were used for extracellular or pseudo-intra-axonal recordings under direct visual control. The recording session began less than 1 h after cessation of centrifugation and typically lasted 12–14 h. In preliminary experiments, we noticed utricular afferents were inconsistently responsive to EVS stimulation, while at the same time HC afferents were consistently activated. Therefore, responses of ∼5–10 HC afferents were recorded at the start of each session to adjust and confirm efferent stimulation parameters. Sinusoids of 10–20°/s at 0.5–5 Hz were delivered about the z-axis (yaw rotation) as well as visual localization to identify canal afferents. Consistency of stimulus intensity was verified throughout the experiment. Another set of canal afferents (range 8–27) was recorded at the end of each session to confirm EVS efficacy and evaluate canal response to rotation. Centrifugation Procedures NASA Ames prototype centrifuge was used to subject the fish to HG of variable duration and magnitude (Figure 1A). The centrifuge consists of four radial arms with a one-degree of freedom swing gondola (labeled A1) at the end of each arm to maintain gravity vector relative to the fish during rest and centrifugation and positioned 1.22 m eccentric to center of rotation. Two magnitudes of HG were applied. Main protocol was a 38-rpm spin delivering a 1 g (Earth) plus 2 G (centripetal) force imparting a 2.24 g (=sqrt(12 + 22)) resultant force. Duration of 2.24 g exposures was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 16, 24, or 32 days in groups of four to five fish. In separate experiments, the spin was reduced to 19 rpm resulting in a 1 g centripetal force or 1.12 g (=sqrt(12 + 12)) resultant force; duration of 1.12 g exposures in groups of four fish was confined to 4 and 16 days. Loading and unloading of fish were scheduled to minimize the stop time, typically <10 min. Twelve separate runs were conducted over a 3-year period to acquire the reported HG results. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Experimental and testing devices. (A) Ground-based centrifuge was used to apply centripetal force by constant velocity rotation within a concomitant 1 g environment. Centrifuge had four gondolas (labeled A1) positioned at a radial distance of 1.22 m from center of axis of rotation. Each gondola was gimbaled with one-degree of freedom to deliver a constant gravity vector onto fish at any given rotational rate. Self-contained aquarium systems (labeled A2) were developed to permit life support for one fish in each gondola consisting of mechanical and biological filtrations, cooling, and oxygenation within a 12:12 light:dark cycle. Fish were unrestrained during centrifugation and their behavior was captured in light using video. (B) Acceleration testing device was designed and fabricated to study afferent responses to controlled translational motions delivered along the tandem rails labeled B6 and B7 at any head orientation via yaw rotation controlled by motor labeled B3. The motor labeled B4 delivered tilt stimulation from pitch to roll. See text for more details.Fully sealed fish tanks were fabricated from 1.3-cm Plexiglas® tubes of 30.5-cm dia capped at both ends, and with a molded, sealable opening on the curved surface to permit access to the fish. An individual habitat (labeled A2) was placed in each gondola, contained ∼20 l of saltwater and housed either one fish or none at a time (for scheduling). A closed loop system continuously circulated water through mechanical and biological filtrations and a heat exchanger to chill the saltwater to 15°C on the return side. The room was cooled to <15°C to counter heat generated by the motor. A DC powered air stone aerated the saltwater, and pressure was released via a one-way valve. Light/dark (12:12 h) cycles during centrifugation were normalized to home aquaria. Fish were unrestrained and allowed to swim freely in the habitat. During centrifugation, two forces are applied to the fish in addition to the constant force of gravity: a centripetal force dependent on radius of eccentricity and rate of rotation. To account for possible variations in vestibular function due to rate of rotation, a separate rate table was configured that permitted a single tank to be placed precisely at the center of rotation axis. These On-Center Control (OCC) experiments were conducted one fish at a time with a spin of 38 rpm for groups of four fish at either 4- or 16-day duration. All parameters were matched to the centrifuged fish with the exception that no (or negligible) centripetal force was imparted to the fish. Fish were monitored in the light cycle using video. No off-nominal events occurred during any test. Acceleration Testing Device After surgical preparation the tank (labeled B1) was mounted to a multi-axis linear and angular acceleration and tilt system (Figure 1B). Head position of the fish was adjusted to align the otoliths coplanar to Earth horizon using digital commands to one or more axes. The cranial opening was positioned beneath a castle-like structure on which a three-axes remotely controlled motorized micromanipulator (MP-285; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, United States) and preamplifier were fixed. The fish tank and castle-like platform were attached to a Plexiglas® plate (labeled B2) supported by a 15.24-cm dia thrust bearing and attached to a stepper motor (labeled B3) geared (55:1) at 90° (graphically illustrated) to provide a full rotation about the vertical z-axis (yaw); one stepper count equals 0.00026°. This axis allows smooth positioning from one head angle to another with respect to the translational axis to examine afferent directional selectivity, together with applied yaw rotational stimuli. Its center of rotation passed through the center of the head and bilateral labyrinths. Yaw stage was mounted to a 2.54-cm dia shaft through roller bearing pillow blocks to a stepper motor (labeled B4) straight geared (55:1); one stepper count equals 0.00026°. This axis allowed tilt about the axis coplanar to the Earth horizontal (graphically illustrated), and provided either static positioning or dynamic stimuli at angles between pure roll and pure pitch depending on the head angle command to the yaw motor. Next, the tilt stage was attached to a base plate (labeled B5) through roll bearing pillow blocks and stepper motor mount. The base plate was attached to a thrust block brushless linear motor (not visible in Figure 1B), which was in turn mounted to a 165-cm precision linear bearing guidance system (IDC, Petaluma, CA, United States) (labeled B6); a non-contact, incremental linear encoder provided a position sensing with 10 μm accuracy and voltage proportional to instantaneous linear velocity was derived from the servo controller; this signal was integrated in Spike2 data acquisition software to obtain a derived acceleration signal. A second, slaved rail, and linear bearing gliders (labeled B7) were coupled to the thrust block to provide additional stability and lower the center of mass of the top plate. The device was secured to an optical breadboard (TMC) (labeled B8) to ensure flatness and provide isolation, and floated from the lab floor by jelly pads to absorb substrate-borne vibrations. Unit recording stability was confirmed up to 0.5 g at 12 Hz (maximum tested). A digital controller (Galil Motion Control, Rocklin, CA, United States) installed on a Windows-based platform provided command signals to each motor. Software control was based on Galil motion control libraries called from a user interface written in Igor (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, United States) scripts to permit step or continuous, dynamic motion about one or more axes at selectable parameters. Terminology of Motion Stimuli Lab-defined frame of motion reference along the horizontal axis at 0° corresponded to a positive acceleration directed forward out the fish’s snout; activation of the tilt stage (Figure 1B, B4) at this position delivered a pure roll to one side or the other. Activation of the yaw stage (Figure 1B, B3) produced counter-clockwise (CCW) or CW rotation in the horizontal plane to change the head orientation with respect to the linear motion. Yaw rotation of the platform to + 90° (right-hand rule, CCW) about the z-axis produced a positive inter-aural acceleration directed out the right (ipsilateral to recording side) ear and the converse out the opposite ear, and activation of the tilt stage produced a pure pitch with either head-down or -up. Yaw rotation of the platform to 180° about the z-axis produced a positive sled acceleration directed forward but now out the fish’s tail, and activation of the tilt stage produced again a pure roll to one side or the other. Yaw rotation of platform to 270° about the z-axis produced a positive acceleration directed out the left (contralateral to recording side) ear and the converse out the right ear, and activation of the tilt stage produced again a pure pitch. Sinusoidal translation along the horizontal plane ranged from 0.03 to 0.3 g at 0.3–5 Hz and was limited by the excursion of the rail; sinusoidal tilt stimuli ranged from 0.01 to 2° at 0.3–10 Hz and up to 5° static tilt and the parameters tested were dependent mainly on recording stability; sinusoidal yaw rotations were confined to 10–30°/s at 0.1–5 Hz. Vestibular Test Protocol Test protocol was designed to provide direct comparisons of afferent responses to translation within and across the populations subjected to different HG and adaptation conditions. Secondarily, tilt stimuli were used to extend the response characteristics. The hair cell’s bundle is morphologically polarized (Wersäll, 1972) and its receptor potential is directionally sensitive and behaves as a rectified cosine-function to bundle displacement (Hudspeth and Corey, 1977; Shotwell et al., 1981); the functional polarization vectors of utricular afferents are distributed in a fanlike shape (Fernández and Goldberg, 1976b), as is to be expected from the hair cell orientations in the macula (Spoendlin, 1964). Afferent directional selectivity was defined by its maximum (Smax) and minimum or null (Smin) sensitivities. To accomplish this a sinusoidal translation along a plane parallel to Earth was delivered as the fish was rotated about the yaw or z-axis (Angelaki and Dickman, 2000; Boyle et al., 2001) and paused to collect five or more consecutive cycles. In our standard test protocol, a 1–2 Hz translational sinusoid was delivered at amplitude of ±0.02–0.05 g as the fish was stepped about the z-axis in typically successive 15° steps. Test magnitude was set to prevent as well as possible any nonlinear distortions of afferent impulse rate (IR) such as saturation in the ON-direction or “cut off” in the OFF-direction. In successful recordings, the afferent Smax and Smin to translation were captured within five to nine steps; in some cases, the Smin was not obvious (discussed later in the section “Results”). In many cases the recording was compromised before completing the required protocol and the data were discarded. In afferents with particularly stable recording conditions static and dynamic tilts were delivered, selected often at the z-axis angle that elicited its Smin and Smax responses to translations. Static tilts were typically ±1–3° displacement (12°/s2 ramp on/off) and were held to determine the time course of impulse adaptation. In some instances afferent directional selectivity was determined for both translations and tilts. Data Acquisition and Analysis Data waveforms and events were digitized, displayed in real-time using Spike2 software, and stored for later analysis (CED Power 1401). Direct voltage measures of angular displacements (in degree) about the two (yaw and tilt) rotational axes, acceleration (cm/s2) from the linear encoder and the derived velocity (cm/s), and the linear accelerators (g) along the horizontal plane were amplified externally to span the full 16-bit range of the A/D converters, filtered below the Nyquist frequency, and digitized at 500–1000 samples/s. Time stamping for stimulus trigger events, efferent shock times, and externally discriminated spike times was acquired to a resolution of 0.08 ms. Data were imported off-line into a custom interactive analysis procedure written in Igor. Desired portions of record with respect to specific stimuli were manually selected and inspected using an interactive graphical analysis procedure. A stimulus trigger (positive zero-crossing) was used as a time reference to generate 100–180 bin/cycle phase histograms of stimulus and response. A discrete Fourier analysis was applied to compute the first-harmonic stimulus/response amplitude and phase. Response sensitivity (afferent output/stimulus input) was calculated by dividing IR modulation of derived 1st harmonic of modulation by acceleration amplitude, e.g., impulse rate (IR) per second (ips) per cm/s2 or g (9.81 m/s2) linear acceleration; response phase is angle between output and input peaks in ° using the lab-defined reference. A cosine function was applied to data in a method following (Angelaki, 1991; Angelaki et al., 1993) to determine degree of spatial tuning, directional selectivity, and response maximum (Smax) and its minimum (Smin). Some afferents are silenced over a portion of the stimulus cycle. In the least squares fitting procedure bins lacking data were not assigned a value of zero, and therefore the curve fit was not influenced by a truncated response. This form of response nonlinearity may lead to a misrepresentation of data because a portion of the curve fit will take negative values. When detected in real time, the stimulus was reduced in amplitude to permit a more full-cycle impulse modulation. Despite these efforts and the need to maintain comparable stimulus parameters for capturing Smax response saturation and silencing of the discharge were often unavoidable. Both the mean IR, defined as IR at half of computed peak-to-peak modulation, and the average IR, defined as number of impulses divided by stimulus cycle time, were measured. The former IR assists in detecting large truncated or clipped responses and the latter took into account the different cycle time of sinusoids used and served as a more reliable measure of IR during stimulation. Samples of IR >30 s in length (from 120 to >36,000 interspike intervals) in the absence of stimulation were taken to describe the afferent background impulse properties. Degree of regularity was evaluated by determining the non-normalized coefficient of variation (CV) of rate, defined as the standard deviation of interspike intervals divided by mean interval. An example of protocol for characterizing afferent responses in control and experimental fish to linear acceleration (panels A–C) and to tilt (panel D) is given in Figure 3. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Uricular afferent response properties. (A) Recorded data of afferent response in control fish show IR modulation to sinusoidal linear acceleration at 2 Hz collected over time from 301 to 305.5 s. Traces from top to bottom: (1) yaw position of fish (set at 90°). (2) Linear acceleration of sled in ±cm/s2. (3) Linear velocity of sled in ±cm/s. (4) Instantaneous IR in impulses per second (ips). (B) Data in A were averaged and displayed as phase histogram; upper trace is unit IR (ips) and lower trace is stimulus acceleration (LA) in g (dotted curves represent the 1st harmonic fit to the stimulus and response). (C) Directional selectivity of utricular afferents. Responses were analyzed at 21 separate orientations of fish in space shown in the abscissa from 0° (positive linear acceleration directed in horizontal plane out fish’s snout) to accelerations directed in horizontal plane out fish’s right (90°) or left (270°) ear and at orientations in between. Cartoons give at five positions of fish to help visualize the stimulus. Maximum response (in ips/g) was calculated at each orientation and plotted as a function of head angle (in °). A cosine function (red curve) was applied to data to determine degree of spatial tuning, directional selectivity, and response maximum (Smax) and its minimum (Smin). In this example Smax was 3234 ips/g at 90° (comparable at 270°) and afferent was highly spatially tuned (Smin/Smax = 0). (D) Responses of same afferent to sinusoidal tilt simulation at 2 Hz, ±0.11° displacement. Format is same as in C. Upper trace gives a broad description of stimulus, from Roll with Right ear down at 0°, Pitch with Nose down at 90°, Roll with Left ear down at 180°, and Pitch with Tail down at 270°. Yellow vertical line between C and D is given to provide the 90° offset of the two stimuli by the lab-defined coordinate scheme, and how closely the responses match. Smax for tilt was 801 ips/° at 7° head angle, and the spatial tuning was tight (Smin/Smax = 0.04).Statistical afferent data analyses were performed using built-in one-way ANOVA packages in Igor (v.7) and KleidaGraph (v. 4.5) with post hoc analysis (Tukey’s all pairs comparison test). Data are presented throughout as the mean ± SD as single group and compared as paired data using Student’s t-test and levels of statistical probability are two-tailed values. Differences were considered significant for p < 0.05. Histology At the end of each experiment a small opening was made in the dorsal aspect of the anterior canal limb, and a glass pipette with ∼50 μm opening was inserted into canal lumen and directed rostrally toward the anterior ampulla. The pipette was attached to a 1 ml syringe, and the endolymph was flushed with fixative solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sucrose, and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Perfusate was colorized using alcian blue to visualize it flowing across the anterior ampulla, entering the utricular space and duct, and exiting via the common crus from the distal end of the cut canal limb. The utricle and a portion of its nerve were extracted, and the utricle was opened to expose the macula and immersed in fixative overnight. Maculae were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide with 1.25% potassium ferrocyanide, dehydrated, infiltrated, and embedded in Epon. Blocks were sectioned using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome in 1-μm thick sections for surveying and 180 nm sections for analysis. Synaptic Body Counts To provide uniformity of synaptic body (SB) counts within our samples and allow direct comparison with a previous work, a protocol based on Ross (2000) was used. The Epon block was cut in 1 μm sections along the short axis of macula to survey the start of the striola border. Once confirmed 100 sections at 1 μm thickness were collected for a separate morphometric evaluation. From that point 150 serial sections of 180 nm thickness were collected to characterize the striola region on both sides of the hair bundle reversal line; a separate comparable collection of serial thin sections was obtained 150 μm medially to characterize the medial extrastriola zone of the macula. Sections were collected individually, mounted on Butvar-coated slot grids, and studied with a Leo 912 AB transmission electron microscope. More details on the ultrastructure of the toadfish utricle and the three-dimensional reconstruction of hair cells can be found in Boyle et al. (2018). Each sample was coded to prevent detection of treatment (control or HG) and experiment day. Digital mosaics were made using the Olympus Soft Imaging System MegaView III digital camera at 5000× (microscopic) magnification from every seventh section and the hair cells were numbered. Mosaicked sections served as maps for locating and identifying the numbered hair cells in non-mosaic sections. Every hair cell on every section (mosaic and non-mosaic) was examined for presence of synaptic bodies and hair cell-afferent synapses. Sections were initially analyzed at 8000× magnification, and suspected synapses were enlarged to 12,500× for validation (see Figures 2A,B). Digital images of all likely synaptic bodies were taken and coded with a number for the section, hair cell, and number of synapses present. A low power image (4000×) was also taken for better cell identification on the map. Combined data were used to accept or reject probable synaptic bodies. Synapses or other structural features of interest were also photographed at this time. Images were transferred to an SGI Onyx for permanent storage and further synapse analysis. For counting, synapses were recorded on sheets of paper on which there are numbered contours of identified hair cells, with the numbers matching those on the maps. Strict criteria for counting synaptic bodies were followed. Only structures consisting of a central, electron-opaque body (presynaptic density), and a halo of vesicles were counted. Panels A and B in Figure 2 show digital images of two consecutive sections separated by section thickness of 180 nm. Arrows in each panel point to the same single SB in the hair cell. Figure 2C shows a cartoon of 2 of the 10 hair cells on either side of the reversal line in the striola as an illustration of method used in tabulating the results. Greater than 90% of synaptic bodies are single specializations along the hair cell internal wall, followed by pairs of bodies, and rarely a cluster of three or more bodies. Because of the time required to perform this task, typically 3–4 months full-time effort per macula, SB counts were done from selected fish in which extensive physiological data were first obtained. Synaptic ribbons in utricular hair cells were analyzed using the ANOVA and MANOVA features of SuperANOVATM software. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Method to identify and count synaptic bodies (ribbons) in utricular hair cells. (A, B) Two consecutive transmission electron microscopic images (12,500× magnification) reveal the same SB (arrow in each panel) in the hair cell. Scale bar, 1 μm. (C) Two-dimensional cartoon of method used to tabulate and characterize the unique synaptic bodies in each hair cell reconstructed in 3D from 150 serial sections of 180 nm thickness. Two 100 μm width patches separated by 150 μm in striola (shown with the reversal line) and medial extrastriola regions of macula were examined in same fish in which afferent recordings were collected. Sections were viewed at 500–20,000× to verify synaptic bodies within the section and carried over into adjacent sections. Synapse characterization is based on following criteria. Single body: most common and do not share synaptic vesicles with nearby bodies if present. Pair: less common with two synaptic bodies sharing vesicles on one section, or adjacent sections. Group: least common with ≥3 bodies sharing vesicles on one section, or across multiple serial sections.",
    "results": "Results Control Responses to Translational Accelerations and Tilts in Normal Gravity Response properties of utricular afferent were studied in control fish housed in 1 g to establish baseline measures needed for direct comparison within and across fish exposed to the different experimental conditions. A representative utricular afferent behavior in control fish to linear acceleration (panels A–C) and to tilt (panel D) is given in Figure 3. Orientation of the fish about the z-axis (Yaw Position in A) was set at 90° to provide a positive acceleration directed out the fish’s right ear along the inter-aural axis ipsilateral to the recording site. Nine consecutive cycles of sinusoidal linear acceleration (±15.7 cm/s2 or ±0.016 g) at 2 Hz were recorded (A) and averaged (B) to give a response of the following characteristics: averaged modulation was ±51.7 ips about a fitted rate of 47 ips, with a sensitivity of 3.3 ips/cm/s2 or 3234 ips/g occurring at peak phase of -134° re: acceleration. Average IR was 41 ips/cycle indicating a slight silencing of its rate in the OFF-direction. This response represented the afferent Smax. Afferent directional selectivity, a critical parameter to measure across experimental fish to precisely establish Smax, the spatio-temporal characteristics of averaged data at different head angles are plotted in Figure 3C. Cartoons of fish show the direction of +linear acceleration at five different fish orientations. Smax (Figure 3C) is the uppermost point (solid circle) on the yellow line. Rotation of fish about the z-axis from Smax at 90° head angle (Figures 3A,B) by half-circle to 270° head angle elicited a comparable and expected Smax along the inter-aural axis but with a 180° phase shift due to the lab-specific denotation. Peak of response modulation with respect to peak acceleration amplitude typically remained consistent over a hemi-field of head angles, rectified as the polarity shifted in the lab-defined coordinates, and showed variable leads to lags. Data were fit by a rectified (temporal or phase of response; black curve superposed on open circle symbols of phase re: acceleration) cosine (amplitude of modulation) function (red curve in Figure 3C superposed on solid blue circle symbols of gain data). Note the rise and fall of gain in a cosine fashion as the fish’s orientation was shifted from inter-aural accelerations to accelerations directed out the fish’s snout or tail. The afferent was tested for nearly 360° change in orientation at 21 separate head angles. The fitted nulled value of 0 for Smin (e.g., Smin/Smax = 0 in the example in Figure 3C) reflected the sharpness of directional tuning and the correspondence between tested (filled and open circles) and fitted (red and black curve) responses was sharp. Same afferent’s responses to tilt stimuli at 2 Hz, ±0.16° displacement, were recorded in a similar fashion at 23 separate orientations to determine Smax and Smin to tilt (D). Smax was 801 ips/° and nearly aligned to pure roll tilt as expected from the inter-aural responses to linear acceleration. Smin was near a complete null (32 ips/°) response predicted from the Smax to linear acceleration (yellow line) at both nose down (Pitch-N) and tail down (Pitch-T) pitch tilts, and the Smin/Smax ration was 0.04. Note the congruency between the responses to the two stimuli: Smax for linear acceleration (in C) was directed along the inter-aural axis out the right ear and Smax for tilt (in D) occurred at pure roll with right ear down. Similarly, Smin for linear acceleration occurred in forward or backward movements and Smin for tilts occurred in pure nose down or up pitches. Afferent responses presented in Figure 3 are representative of 162 afferents recorded in 12 control fish, and Table 1 summarizes the principal findings (bottom row). Averaged Smax was 2103 ± 1314 ips/g (or 2.02 ± 1.39 ips/cm/s2) and directional selectivity was tightly tuned, having an Smin/Smax ratio of 0.085 ± 0.14 (range 0.0–0.48l, n = 81). Value in parentheses in Table 1 is number of afferents in which a clear Smin was also captured. One-half (n = 81 out of 162) of control records had a distinct Smin. To be included in the calculation of Smax at least five or more tests covering 75–90° head angles were tested and a clear maximum on a cosine function was evident. Often Smin was captured, but the recording was compromised before Smax response was reached and thus omitted from analysis. Figure 4 shows the topographical structure of the utricular macula (A) and distribution of recorded head angle at its Smax for the 162 control afferents (filled black circles) in a polar plot. Head angle at Smax occurred at virtually all angles in 2D space (±180°) in control fish, averaged 95 ± 82° (Table 1) and represents an acceleration directed out the ipsilateral (right) ear as expected for prevalence of afferents supplying the large medial extrastriola (asterisk) macula evident in Figure 4A. Table 1. Physiological characteristics of toadfish utricular (Utr) afferents to sinusoidal translation acceleration as a function of duration and magnitude of exposure to HG and readaptation to 1 g. Open in a new tab Twenty-three (23) experimental groups (rows) were tested to controlled translational acceleration in the Earth horizon plane. Nine groups are identified by the duration of exposure, e.g., 1D indicates one (1) day (D) of exposure, to a constant resultant centripetal acceleration of 2.24 g; two groups of either 4 or 16 days of exposure to 1.12 g; five groups of 4 days of exposure to 2.24 g followed by 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 days of recovery (Rec) in normal 1 g; four groups of 16 days of exposure to 2.24 g followed by 2, 4, 6, or 8 days of recovery in normal 1 g; two groups are identified as OCC by either 4 or 16 days of exposure to 38 revolution per minute without an appreciable centripetal acceleration; and the last group is standard laboratory control fish. Columns provide the number of utricular afferents in each group (total of 4233 afferents); response Smax of response at the afferent’s preferred direction (in impulse/s/g, or ips/g); Smin of response over the Smax as a measure of directional selectivity (number in parentheses gives the number of afferents having a verified Smin); head angle (in degree, °) at Smax; and IR at Smax (in impulse per second per cycle time). Last three columns are data obtained from number of HC afferents (N =), their average IR per cycle time of yaw rotation, and their averaged response sensitivity in ips/°/s of angular yaw rotation. Rows highlighted in red are early significant hypersensitivity (Smax) responses and adaption rate, and row highlighted in blue are later significant hyposensitivity (Smax) responses and adaption rate. Values are mean ± SD. Significance (ANOVA): ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.005, or ∗∗∗p < 0.0001.FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Sampling bias consideration. (A) Low magnitude scanning electron micrograph of the left utricular macula was flipped 180° to correspond to the right utricle for comparison with data in B. View from above rostral is up and medial is left (see key in upper left corner). Utricular macula is outlined in yellow, the reversal line in striola region is in red; more details of the utricle morphology can be found in Boyle et al. (2018). From left to right (medial to lateral): large medial extrastriola (asterisk), a striola zone on either side of the reversal line (red line), and a relatively narrow lateral extrastriola region approaching the ampullae of the anterior (AC) and horizontal (HC) semicircular canals. Hair bundle on each hair cell is morphological polarized and broadly depicted as blue arrows pointing from the shortest stereocilia to the kinocilium, and the polarization flips at the reversal line (red line). (B) Afferent responses (ips/g) are plotted in a polar graph as a function of head angle (°) at Smax for control fish and for fish exposed to 2.24 g for 4 or 16 days. Head angle at Smax of recorded responses was consistent for all fish, indicating no evidence of sampling bias from one region to another or between experimental groups. Right-hand rule was used, and 0° is + acceleration out the fish’s snout, 90° out the ipsilateral (right) ear, 180° out the fish’s tail, and 270° out the contralateral (left) ear (depicted in upper right corner in A). Also note that the majority of afferents recorded in these three separate conditions showed responses aligned to innervating hair cells in the medial extrastriola.Measured values of Smax (range 149–7326 ips/g) and IR (range 8–102 ips/cycle; mean 40 ± 19 ips; n = 162) covered a broad range among control afferents. Despite the variability a weak, but significant, positive correlation was found between the Smax and IR (Figure 5A; paired correlation, R = 0.25; n = 162). Control mean IR (MIR) at rest had an even weaker, but nevertheless significant, negative correlation (paired correlation, R = -0.11; n = 107) with its degree of regularity of interspike interval as measured by coefficient of variability or CV (mean 0.53 ± 0.22; range 0.1–1.4; n = 107). As a result, Smax was positively correlated with CV (paired correlation, R = 0.28; n = 107), and thus broadly speaking an afferent having a high sensitivity to acceleration, a high IR during acceleration and rest, and a more irregular spacing of its interspike intervals at rest. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Correlation of response sensitivity and discharge properties in fish exposed to different levels of HG. A positive and significant (p < 0.001) correlation persisted between Smax (ips/g) and average IR at Smax (ips/cycle) for the 162 control afferents (A), the 153 afferents tested after 4 days at 2.24 g (B), and the 177 afferents tested after 16 days at 2.24 g (C).Figure 6 shows two afferent responses to static and dynamic tilt. Afferent in panel A is a continuation of record of the same afferent illustrated in Figure 3. At the beginning of the record (see arrow pointing to insert) sinusoidal tilts at 2 Hz, ±0.16°, were delivered over seven cycles at a head angle of 345°, within 22° (and 15° from pure roll) from the calculated head angle at Smax, and the afferent showed a modulation of ±112 ips, or a unit gain of 680 ips/°, that peaked at 43°. After ∼25 s of rest the fish was tilted 3° right (ipsilateral) side down. As expected from the response to dynamic tilts, IR was elevated by ∼125 ips and showed a fast and slow time course of response decay of 4.3 and 44.6 s, respectively. Returning the fish back to initial horizontal position (near the 250 s mark) and then tilting it from the horizontal position (near the 425 s mark) to (-) 3° left (contralateral) side down suppressed the IR that recovered back near rest in a similar manner. A right-down tilt back to original horizontal position produced a comparable excitatory response. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Different afferent behaviors to tilt in control fish. (A) Robust responses to both dynamic and static tilt displacements in control afferent. Upper trace is tilt displacement (in °) and lower trace is instantaneous IR (ips) over a continuous recording of ∼750 s. Insert shows an expanded portion early in the record during 2Hz, ±0.16°, sinusoidal tilt. Tilt stimulus was delivered at a head angle of 345°, or nearly a pure roll stimulus, with right side (positive values) down and ipsilateral to recorded afferent. Static displacements were delivered at the same head angle starting with right side down and hold, a tilt in the opposite direction to normal horizontal position and hold, a left side down and hold, and a return tilt in the opposite direction to normal horizontal position and hold. Fast (red curve) and slow (yellow curve) time constants of return to baseline IR were seen in the excitatory direction of tilt. Tilt stimuli in the opposite direction, contralateral to recording site, silenced the afferent in both instances. (B1) Different control afferent has a response to dynamic, but not static, tilt displacements. Same format as A. Sinusoidal 2 Hz tilts (±0.14°) were delivered before and after ±3° static displacements and are marked B2 and B3. Phase histograms in panels B2 and B3 show the corresponding averaged modulation of 332 and 260 ips/°, and peak modulation lead position by 9.4 and 17.4°, respectively, respectively. During static displacements at the afferent Smax of 135°, midway between left side down roll and tail down pitch, afferent maintained a near constant IR of 41–45 ips (labeled on tilt trace).Although responses to sinusoids and static tilts corresponded well in most tested afferents (n = 22), there was considerable variability in response to static tilt in nearly the same number of afferents (n = 18) that were responsive to translational accelerations. An extreme example is given in Figure 6B. In B1 sinusoids were presented at 2 Hz (±0.14°) both before (labeled B2) and after (labeled B3) a similar sequence of ±3° tilts in both directions spaced by returns to normal horizontal position. The fish was oriented at a head angle of 135°, and thus tilts were delivered midway between roll and pitch, corresponding to afferent Smax for dynamic tilt. Numbers associated with each step orientation ranged from 41 to 45 ips over the selected period, indicating the afferent was unresponsive to ±3° static displacements but responsive to ±0.14° displacements when presented as sinusoids. Because of this variability in tilt responses, comparisons within and across the HG experimental groups were based on afferent responses to translational acceleration. Control Responses to Efferent Vestibular System (EVS) Stimulation in Normal Gravity Utricular afferent response to EVS activation was in general comparable to that observed in HC afferents in the same species (Boyle and Highstein, 1990b): elevation in IR and reduction in response sensitivity. As mentioned in the section “Materials and Methods,” we found that EVS activation was less prevalent in utricle than in HC recordings. To ensure efficacy of stimulation within each experiment we first recorded HC afferents to adjust placement and intensity of EVS pulses. Of the 112 HC afferents recorded and tested to EVS stimulation, only 13 (12%) were unresponsive. Table 2 gives the action of EVS stimulation on IR of control utricular afferents (bottom row). Of the 32 afferents in which EVS activation could be paired to the same afferent’s IR at rest only ∼one-third (37%) were responsive whereas 63% of the afferents were unresponsive in the same preparations as the HC recordings. The effective action of EVS stimulation on utricular afferents was a near doubling of IR from 37.1 ± 23.7 to 62.8 ± 30.5 ips, without altering CV (0.6 ± 0.32 at rest and 0.58 ± 0.31 during EVS excitation). Table 2. Physiological response of utricular afferents to electrical activation of efferent vestibular system (EVS). Open in a new tab Same groups are given in Table 1. Columns provide the number of afferents in each group with paired control and EVS responses; the MIR at rest (ips); coefficient of variability (cv) at rest as a measure of the degree of regularity of interspike interval; MIR (ips) during EVS stimulation; cv measure during EVS stimulation; absolute change in IR during EVS stimulation above IR at rest; and the percent change in IR response (%R). Red highlights the significant elevation of the IR during EVS stimulation; blue highlights the significant depression of the IR during EVS stimulation. Significance (ANOVA): ∗p < 0.05 or ∗∗p < 0.005.Afferent modulation to a linear acceleration can be profoundly influenced by EVS activation. Figure 7 shows disruption of response to a 2 Hz sinusoidal linear acceleration of ±24.4 cm/s2 (or ±0.025 g) by EVS activation via a shock train applied to the brainstem (A) or self-generated by the fish itself (B). In the absence of EVS activation the afferent had an averaged response modulation of ±6.3 ips (±0.26 ips/cm/s2 or ±252 ips/g) centered about an IR of 7.2 ips that was temporarily altered by the brief epoch of EVS stimulation. When EVS action was less pronounced, afferent rate was elevated while at the same time its response modulation was decreased but not abolished. Record in Figure 8A shows instantaneous IR (unit, in ips) and raw voltage record (in mV) for 2 Hz ± 0.24° sinusoidal tilt of the fish rotated 90°, thereby delivering pure roll (±right down/left up) stimuli. EVS stimulation elevated IR 4.5-fold from 11.8 ips (B, control cycles) to 51.9 ips (C), while halving response modulation from 11.6 ips (or 63.6 ips/°; B, control cycles) to 7.4 ips (or 31.4 ips/°; C). Mean percent reduction in response sensitivity to linear acceleration in 27 tested utricular afferents was 56.7 ± 24.1 (range 18–88%; afferents in which the response was completely abolished were not included in this calculation). During a more steady state level of EVS activation after the initial onset of EVS pulses, the temporal relation of response modulation to stimulus (phase in ° with respect to peak °) was unaffected, similar to that seen in HC afferents (Boyle and Highstein, 1990b). However, the response to acceleration over any portion of the stimulus cycle can be dramatically altered during short bursts of EVS activation, such as the records in Figures 7A,B and the two brief epochs shown in the first portion of record in Figure 8A. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Electrically evoked (A) or self-generated (B) efferent vestibular system (EVS) activation elevates afferent rate and reduces or even blocks its response to linear acceleration. In the absence of EVS activation afferent showed an averaged response of 2 Hz linear acceleration. During a brief pulse train of EVS stimulation (A), afferent IR was elevated and its response to applied acceleration disrupted. This result is also seen when the fish activated the EVS on its own as seen in the two epochs in B. Self-generated epochs of EVS activation excite the afferent with differing patterns and alter its response to an applied perturbation. Traces in A and B are from top to bottom instantaneous firing rate (Unit, ips), EVS pulse train, raw voltage of afferent (mV), and the applied linear acceleration (LA, in cm/s2).FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab EVS activation elevates IR and partially shunts afferent response to linear acceleration. (A) Afferent response to 2 Hz (±0.24°) sinusoidal pure nose-down pitch in absence and presence of electrical EVS stimulation. Segment of record without EVS stimulation (time ∼350 s) is highlighted in blue box in A and the corresponding averaged response histogram is given in B; a similar portion of record in A is captured during EVS stimulation and highlighted in yellow box and its corresponding averaged response histogram is given in C. (B) During control cycles, afferent responded with a ±15.5 ips modulation about a discharge rate of 11.6 ips, and averaged ±63.6 ips/° and a phase lag re: position of –39°. (C) During cycles with combined EVS stimulation, modulation dropped by ∼50% to ±7.4 ips, now centered about an elevated discharge rate of 51.9 ips, and averaged sensitivity was reduced by about one-half to 31.4 ips/° and the phase lag (–34°) remained unaffected in the selected portion of the record. Traces in A from top to bottom: position of yaw axis at 90° during tilt stimulus corresponding to roll tilt, instantaneous firing rate (in ips), EVS epochs, and raw voltage of afferent (in mV). (B, C) Averaged responses from selected portions of the record in A. Ordinates in B and C are equivalent to show the elevation in discharge rate and reduction of response modulation (see text for further explanation). Utricular Afferent Responses to Acceleration in On-Center-Control (OCC) Condition During centrifugation, the fish was exposed to both a centripetal force dependent on its eccentricity and constant rotations per minute (rpm) and the constant force of gravity. A separate device was used to place the fish precisely at the center of rotation thereby matching as well as possible all parameters except now in the absence of centripetal force. Fish were exposed to either 4 or 16 days of rotation at 38 rpm. As listed in Table 1, the OCC utricular afferents behaved statistically identical in all measured parameters after both 4-day (N = 226 afferents) and 16-day (N = 177 afferents) to the control fish not exposed to any experimental condition prior to recordings. In the insert in Figure 9B Smax (in ips/g) of individual responses are plotted as a function of percent within each control group, and shows the complete overlap of OCC afferents with their control counterparts. FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab Effect of reduced and enhanced gravity on maximum response sensitivity (Smax) of utricular afferents. (A) Data were collected after microgram exposure on STS-90 and -95 orbital shuttle missions (modified Figure 3 of Boyle et al., 2001). Percent plot shows the afferent Smax as a function of time after landing in hours from first (10–16 h) to last (112–117 h) recording session. Within the first day after landing, Smax (red circles) to an applied linear acceleration was significantly (p < 0.01; ∗) greater than for controls (solid black line). Sensitivity returned to near normal values after ∼30 h following landing, as revealed by the data collected in the same fish at varying hours of delay after landing and indicated by separate symbols. (B, insert) OCCs at 4 and 16 days of exposure to 228°/s (38 rpm) constant angular velocity to mimic the rotation during 2.24 g centrifugation are plotted in four fish each together with non-rotated control afferents. Smax was indistinguishable in the three control groups and revealed no influence of rotation alone on response behavior of utricular afferents (insert). (B) Mean Smax of control afferents to a standard translation is 2103 ± 1314 (SD; n = 162) ips/g, and their responses lie on the solid black trace in percent plot. Afferent responses within each group for designated days of 2.24 g (1 day, 2 days, …) exposures are given with separate symbols and traces as indicated in the key. A significant elevation of Smax at 3-day (n = 228 afferents) and 4-day (n = 153 afferents) was observed (p < 0.0001; ∗∗∗); 90–100% of the afferents in these groups had a markedly greater Smax than the 162 control afferents. The elevation was followed by several days (5 to ≥8 days) of normal afferent sensitivity and then by a significant decrease at 16-day (n = 245 afferents; p < 0.0001; ∗∗∗), 24-day (n = 177 afferents; p < 0.005; ∗∗), and 32-day (n = 192 afferents; p < 0.005; ∗∗). Number of afferents recorded in each group is given in parentheses. Horizontal Canal Afferent Behavior in Normal and Altered Gravity: Internal Control Horizontal canal afferents recorded in control fish in normal gravity (n = 58) behaved in an identical manner to that previous reported in toadfish (Boyle and Highstein, 1990a). Table 1 (right columns) gives the consistent averaged IR during sinusoidal yaw rotation (in ips/cycle) for 58 control HC afferents, 162 HC afferents in On-Center-Control (OCC) afferents, 604 HC afferents recorded after 1–32 days of 2.24 g centrifugation, 518 HC afferents recorded after 4 or 16 days of centrifugation followed by a recovery period, and 97 HC afferents recorded after 4 or 16 days of 1.12 g centrifugation. Despite the wide range of duration and intensity of the experimental conditions, HC afferent IR was unaffected. Horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were also unaffected by the experimental conditions (q.v. Supplementary Figure 1). HC afferents exhibit a wide range of response dynamics and can be broadly termed as low or high gain velocity encoding and acceleration encoding afferents (Boyle and Highstein, 1990a), and the prevalence of each afferent population and its response characteristics were equivalent under all experimental conditions. Table 1 (right columns) gives the averaged response sensitivity (in ips/°/s) of HC afferents to a 0.5–1 Hz (±10–15°/s) sinusoidal angular yaw rotation for each experimental group. No significant difference was observed in response and IR to rotation among the recorded afferents, suggesting there was no broad, non-descript action on the periphery during the experimental tests. In conclusion, behavior of HC afferents serves as an internal control of variables associated with centrifugation, such as the duration (1–32 days) of 1.12 or 2.24 g centrifugation, length of recovery to normal gravity (1–8 days), and constant angular rotation without centripetal force (OCC) used in the present study. Utricular Afferent Responses to Acceleration and Tilt Following 2.24 g Exposure Principal reaction to HG was an adjustment of response sensitivity as a function of the magnitude and duration of exposure (q.v. Supplementary Figure 2). Reaction was bi-phasic starting with a significant twofold increase in Smax after 3 (N = 228 afferents) and peaked at 4 (N = 153 afferents) days of exposure (highlighted in red in Table 1), with a return to normal values after 5 (N = 148 afferents) and 8 (N = 196 afferents) days of exposure, and then followed by a significant reduction by ∼one-third after 16 (N = 245 afferents), 24 (N = 177 afferents), and 32 (N = 192 afferents) days of exposure to 2.24 g (highlighted in blue in Table 1). The Smin/Smax ratio remained the same on average for all populations within and across the wide range in experimental conditions. Interestingly, significant changes were observed in average IR at Smax (in ips/cycle; Table 1): average IR was reduced at 2D prior to the sensitivity increase at 3D, and stayed at a 20–40% lower level from 5D to 32D despite the significant changes in Smax over these periods of 2.24 g exposures. Records from the 4- and 16-day fish confirmed that the Smax of the majority of afferents, like their control counterparts, occurred at head angle associated with a positive acceleration directed out the ipsilateral labyrinth (Figure 4B, Table 1). In addition, the positive correlation of Smax and average IR (Figures 5B,C) was maintained after exposures to HG, even with a significant reduction in both Smax and average IR recorded in the 16-day fish (Table 1). Correlations within each group between MIR (ips) and CV and, in turn, Smax were also maintained at the same level of confidence. Data obtained in recovery periods to 1 g from 1 to 8 days after HG indicated that average IR set point was restored after 2 days in normal gravity. It is important to note that HC afferents recorded in each experimental group not only were unaffected in terms of response modulation to yaw rotation as mentioned above, but also had an average IR (41 ± 21 ips/cycle) equal to that of utricular control afferents (40 ± 19 ips/cycle) that remained consistent under all experimental conditions (right two columns of Table 1). Utricular Afferent Responses to Acceleration Following 1.12 g Exposures In a separate, and smaller, sample afferents were studied after 4 or 16 days of HG at one-half the resultant force as the larger sample. A significant elevation in Smax (3274 ± 2113; N = 184 afferents; p < 0.0001, ANOVA) was observed after 4-day exposures to 1.12 g (highlighted in red in Table 1), about half way between control Smax and 4D 2.24 g Smax. Although a reduction in Smax was seen on average in 183 afferents studied after 16-day exposures, it was not statistically significant. All other parameters of response to acceleration and IR properties were unchanged. Comparison of Utricular Afferent Responses to Acceleration Following Micrograms and 2.24 g Exposures Utricular afferents exhibited a profound hypersensitivity when tested to translation upon return to Earth after 9–16 days of microgram exposure on two shuttle orbiter missions and a recovery back to normal after several days (Boyle et al., 2001). These data are given in the percent plot in Figure 9A. Nearly 60% of the afferents tested within 10–16 h after landing (solid red circles) were significantly (p < 0.005) more sensitive than control afferents (solid black line). To put this in perspective an afferent for example had a near saturating IR modulation of ±30 ips for a 1.6 Hz stimulus at an amplitude of ±0.0026 g, in essence a minute vibration that otherwise would be mostly ineffective in eliciting a modulation. Figure 9B gives a percent plot of afferent Smax to translation for control fish (solid black line and insert) and for those after exposure to varying duration of 2.24 g from 1 to 32 days in a comparable manner to Figure 9A for comparison. Initial hypersensitivity was most evident in afferents after 3 (solid orange circles) or 4 (solid red circles) days of 2.24 g exposures, and the separation of Smax from control population was nearly 100%. Responses in these exposures unmistakably resembled those seen initially after space travel and were unexpected. Smax recovered within normal levels at the 5- and 8-day tests before a significant Smax reduction was observed after 16–32 days of 2.24 g exposures (Table 1). Mean Smax (ips/g ± SD) of the experimental data presented in Figure 9B are plotted against days of exposure to 2.24 g in Figure 10A. Interestingly, afferent characteristics across the three (16-, 24-, and 32-day) groups displaying a Smax hyposensitivity was statistically similar (ANOVA), suggesting a plateau had been reached at this stage of the adaptation process. FIGURE 10. Open in a new tab Afferent Smax as a function of days of exposure to 2.24 g and readaptation after return to normal 1 g environment. (A) Histogram plots the mean afferent Smax (ips/g ± SD) (same data as shown in Figure 9B) against time of exposure to centrifugation (in days). (B) Histogram plots afferent Smax as a function of number of days (indicated by number inside of each column) in normal 1 g after 4- and 16-day exposures to centrifugation to the return to baseline levels. Initial hypersensitivity recorded immediately after 4-day exposures (solid red unlabeled column) required >4 days to recover to control levels. The later hyposensitivity observed after 16-day exposures (solid blue unlabeled column) required at least 2 days to recover. In each panel error bars are ±SD, the left column labeled C is the control response values, and asterisks designate the level of significance of p < 0.05 (∗), p < 0.005 (∗∗), and p < 0.0001 (∗∗∗) to control measures. Re-adaptation of Afferent Response After Return to Normal Gravity Figure 10B provides a summary histogram (same format as Figure 10A) of Smax in afferent populations initially exposed to 4 or 16 days of 2.24 g and returned to 1 g until a restoration of normal activity was established. Early hypersensitivity observed after 4 days at 2.24 g took >4 days to recover to control levels, and the later hyposensitivity observed after 16 days at 2.24 g recovered more quickly and required >2 days in 1 g to recover to control levels. Thus, the bi-phasic hyper- to hypo-sensitivity to translations after centrifugation reflected an adaptive process that was restorable with a delay to its original state. Possible Mechanism(s) of Afferent Adaptive Processes to Altered Gravity: Efferent Action By inference afferent sensitivity is expected to lessen or IR to rise or both when EVS is activated episodically or in a steady state; conversely, the removal of a steady state EVS action could lead to an afferent sensitivity increase and IR could remain the same or even decrease. Comparing the results in Table 1 it could be inferred that the early increase and later decrease in Smax was due to an OFF and On EVS action on the hair cell alone, respectively, without a direct action on the afferent. EVS action on afferent rate was almost exclusively excitatory (Figures 7, 8) from the axo-dendritic synapse on the afferent and not through the axo-somatic synapse on the hair cell (Boyle et al., 2009). No consistent evidence emerges from pairing Smax and IR to support a direct systematic EVS role on afferent processing after centrifugation. Table 2 tabulates the magnitude and prevalence of response of EVS activation for paired data within each test group. With only one exception, EVS pulses significantly elevated as expected the IR (EVS IR) above the MIR of background IR in all groups. The sole exception was the afferent group subjected to 32 days at 2.24 g (32D 2.24 g). Here, afferent response to EVS activation was noticeably infrequent with only 11.2% responding (against 37.2% in control afferents), and noticeably weaker with a difference of EVS to non-EVS epochs or IR (ΔEVS) significantly less (6.9 ± 14.9 ips) than that for control afferents (25.7 ± 17.6 ips). These findings at the 32-day mark are not consistent with the significant Smax reduction (Table 1). In the same vein, the afferent response to EVS pulses after 4 days at 2.24 g (4D 2.24 g) was more prevalent with 62.3% responding with significantly greater ΔEVS (43.8 ± 38.1 ips) than that for control afferents. These findings suggest that EVS action was greatly enhanced at 4-day mark, but again the action is not consistent with the significant Smax increase (Table 1). At the present stage it is not possible to establish direct causality of afferent IR and response behavior after HG exposures and EVS action. Possible Mechanism(s) of Afferent Adaptive Processes to Altered Gravity: Synaptic Remodeling Afferent response sensitivity and hair cell synaptic organization were examined in the same animal to determine the possible causality between response magnitude and number of synaptic bodies. Figure 11 shows percent plots of Smax (A, in ips/g) and average IR (B, in ips/cycle) in three groups: controls (black solid circles and line; N = 2), 4 days at 2.24 g (red solid circles and line; N = 2), and 16 days at 2.24 g (blue open circles and line; N = 2). Importantly, highly significant differences in response sensitivity were found in the same fish from which SB counts were taken. In Figure 11A, Smax was significantly higher (p < 0.0001, ANOVA) in 4-day (4945 ± 2823 SD imp/s/g; two fish; n = 93) and significantly lower (p < 0.002, ANOVA) in 16-day (1245 ± 1097 SD imp/s/g; two fish; n = 89) fish from controls (2045 ± 1314 SD imp/s/g; two fish; n = 39). In Figure 11B, the average IR at Smax (in ips/cycle) also differed: rate was significantly lower (p < 0.01, ANOVA) in 16-day (28 ± 15 SD ips/cycle), and higher, but not significantly so, in 4-day (46 ± 21 SD ips/cycle) fish from control afferents (39 ± 24 SD ips/cycle). Figure 11C gives the results of hair cell SB counts in the same fish from which afferent responses were obtained (Figures 11A,B). Number of SB per 100 μm2 was determined for two macular regions, one straddling the reversal line in the striola (shaded columns) and the other 150 μm away in the medial extrastriola (solid columns), in controls (black) and fish exposed to 2.24 g for 4 (red) or 16 (blue) days. On average SB count per hair cell was 4–7 in the two macular regions in each experimental group, and ranged in number from 1 to 13 (n = 223) in control medial extrastriola, 1 to 25 (n = 505) in control striola, 1 to 20 (n = 520) in 4-day medial extrastriola, 1 to 22 (n = 484) in 4-day striola, 1 to 16 (n = 253) in 16-day medial extrastriola, and 1 to 20 (n = 575) in 16-day striola regions. Variability within each group was large and thus, despite the high number of hair cells completely reconstructed in three dimensions, single and multiple SB densities in the two macular regions were not significantly different between control and HG fish. This is in stark contrast to the clear separation in afferent physiology. FIGURE 11. Open in a new tab Direct comparison of physiology of afferents as a function of duration of exposure to 2.24 g to synaptic organization of hair cells in the same fish. (A) Percent plot of Smax shows significantly higher Smax in 4-day (4945 ± 2823 SD imp/s/g; n = 93) and significantly lower Smax (p < 0.002) in 16-day (1245 ± 1097 SD imp/s/g; n = 89) fish from controls (2045 ± 1314 SD imp/s/g; n = 39). (B) The average IR (in ips/cycle) during acceleration at Smax also differed between afferents in these groups: rate was significantly lower in the 16-day (28 ± 15 SD ips/cycle), and higher, but not significantly so, in 4-day (46 ± 21 SD ips/cycle) fish from the control afferents (39 ± 24 SD ips/cycle). Level of significance (ANOVA): p < 0.0001 (∗∗∗), p < 0.002 (∗∗), and p > 0.01 (∗). (C) Number of synaptic bodies per hair cell was determined using 3D computerized serial reconstruction techniques at transmission electron microscopy level from 150 sections of 180 nm thickness from two macular regions, one straddling the reversal line (shaded columns) and the other 150 μm away in the medial extrastriola (solid columns), in control fish (black) and fish exposed to 2.24 g for 4 (red) and 16 (blue) days. Average (±SD) number of synaptic bodies is given above each column. Number (n =) of completely reconstructed hair cells used in this analysis was large and ranged from 223 to 575 hair cells as indicated. Variability within each group was very large and thus, despite the high number of reconstructed hair cells, SB densities in the two macular regions were NOT significantly different between control and centrifuged fish despite the highly significant differences in their responses to acceleration.",
    "discussion": "Discussion As a necessary first step in determining the role of the utricle in neural adaptation to novel gravity loads, otolith afferents were studied to establish benchmarks for comparison within and across the experimental groups. Vestibular afferents, both semicircular canal (frog: Honrubia et al., 1989; toadfish: Boyle and Highstein, 1990a; Boyle et al., 1991; bird: Landolt and Correia, 1980; chinchilla: Baird et al., 1988; cat: Anderson et al., 1978; squirrel monkey: Fernández and Goldberg, 1971; rhesus monkey: Schneider et al., 2015) and otolith fibers (cat: Loe et al., 1973; pigeon: Si et al., 1997; primates: Fernández and Goldberg, 1976a,b,c; Angelaki and Dickman, 2000; Jamali et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2012) differ from one another in their discharge patterns and response properties to adequate stimuli. As seen in other species toadfish utricular afferents showed a wide range of discharge rates, regularity of discharge, and response sensitivity to sinusoidal linear acceleration with a typically tight degree of directional selectivity. The physical basis for differences in response dynamics among otolith afferents is not fully understood, and determining the precise signals originating from different regions of the utricular macula and how these signals enter central otolith reflex pathways have been a challenge. Afferent dendritic organization to the type of hair cell (type I and/or type II) it supplies varies in complexity (see review by Goldberg et al., 2012; Boyle et al., 2018), and it is reasonable to assume that hair cell excitation is not uniform (Spoon et al., 2011; Curthoys et al., 2017). In chinchilla utricle about three-fourths of recorded afferents displayed a more regular discharge of their interspike intervals (Goldberg et al., 1990a,b), and corresponds to about three-fourths the total area of macula designated as the medial extrastriola. Toadfish utricle is structurally similar in the broad sense to other species, including amniotes and other anamniotes, and its hair cell polarization is highly organized across the more 2D macula surface (Boyle et al., 2018). Like the chinchilla, toadfish medial extrastriola occupies about three-fourths the total macula area (Figure 4A) and reflects the responses of the majority of afferents recorded in this study (Figure 4B). Unlike the chinchilla, regularity of discharge of toadfish utricular afferents span a continuum but three-fourths of them are more irregularly discharging. An attractive hypothesis is that vestibular afferent inputs are matched to the dynamic requirements of the various reflexes they target (Highstein et al., 1987; Boyle et al., 1992; McArthur and Dickman, 2008), and evolutionary pressures drive the particular behaviors (Nilsson, 2013; Straka and Baker, 2013; Straka et al., 2014). In this scheme, the prevalent irregular utricular afferents are best matched to the control requirements of the rapid attack and escape avoidance of toadfish. Utricular Afferent Responses After Microgravity (μg) Exposure From the earliest manned orbital missions we know that changes occur in processing of gravitational information during adaptation to microgram and re-adaptation to 1 g upon return to Earth. The adaptive mechanisms to altered gravity might be confined to the peripheral sensory structures or involve central processing centers or likely require the participation of both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Within the first day after STS-90 and -95 shuttle landings, a response hypersensitivity to acceleration stimuli was observed in utricular afferents (Figure 9A; Boyle et al., 2001). Reduced gravity in orbit during these relatively short microgram exposures apparently resulted in an upregulation of afferent sensitivity. Time course of return to normal sensitivity in toadfish afferents paralleled the reported decrease in vestibular disorientation in astronauts after return from shuttle missions (Reschke et al., 1994). Although belonging to a distinct group of animals, recordings taken directly from gravitoreceptors of the land snail (phylum Mollusca), and thus no intervening synapse as in afferent recordings, after exposures of 12–16 (Balaban et al., 2011) and 30 (Aseyev et al., 2017) days in space also showed a pronounced response hypersensitivity to tilt. In a complimentary study in tilapia the gain of an otolith-related vestibuloocular reflex was significantly increased within the first postflight week, and returned to control levels in the second postflight week, of space missions (Sebastian et al., 2001). Orbiting space stations provide a platform to extend human presence in space and capture the physiological response(s) to longer duration of exposures. Hallgren et al. (2016) measured in 1 g the ocular counterrolling (OCR), an otolith-mediated reflex, during centrifugation before and after a 6-month stay in space in 25 astronauts and found a significant reduction in OCR magnitude after landing and its restoration to normal levels in 9 days. Their results are largely in agreement with changes in gaze control reported by Kornilova et al. (2012) in cosmonauts to 129–215 days in space. Adaptation to microgram is likely to change over time from an initial over compensation to restore normalcy to a hyposensitivity more in line with the prevailing gravity. Do the processes of adaptation to microgram in orbit or weightlessness in deep space missions reach a plateau or continue to evolve in time are questions yet to be answered. Utricular Afferent Responses After Hypergravity Exposure Based on the robustness of postflight hypersensitivity of utricular afferents, we expected to find a compensatory hyposensitivity in response to HG. The initial hypersensitivity was unexpected and developed at Day 3 and peaked at Day 4. It was followed by a period of normalcy and then the development of the anticipated hyposensitivity after 16–32 days of HG. Initial hypersensitivity was robust and recovered to normal levels after ∼4–6 days at 1 g. Utricular afferent response to HG did not reflect a systemic action on the labyrinth as a whole, since HC afferents were consistently normal in response and discharge properties and remained independent of level and duration of HG in the same fish. OCCs performed at 4- or 16-day exposure to 228°/s (38 rpm as in 2.24 g runs) constant angular velocity were identical in all measures to their utricular and canal afferent counterparts in non-rotated controls. Video taken during the light cycle did not reveal any aberrant behavior during the different exposures of 2.24 g, perhaps suggesting a central compensatory mechanism in operation. Of prime importance is the fact that in the same species we have the neural response to microgram and a more comprehensive evaluation of the neural response to HG. These results demonstrate that the utricle undergoes continuous plasticity based on magnitude of the prevailing gravity and suggest the possibility that the process of re-adaptation from HG exposure might mimic the process of adaptation to microgram. The organism’s response to transitions in gravity is not simply a step increase or decrease, but varies with time of exposure to the new level of force. Majority of astronauts experience mild-to-severe disorientation for 3–4 days upon initial exposure to microgram, a condition akin to terrestrial motion sickness (Reason and Brandt, 1975). Even though most humans eventually adapt after days to microgram, return to 1 g causes vestibular dysfunction (Reschke et al., 1994; Oman, 1998; Black et al., 1999). The behavior (Anken and Rahmann, 1998) and otolith afferent response sensitivity (Boyle et al., 2001) of fish follow a comparable course of readaptation after landing and therefore restoration to normalcy is likely a general reaction of the organism to short duration (weeks) exposure to microgram. Our data (Figure 10) confirm that readaptation also occurs in afferent response to HG. The organism’s early response to an abrupt change in the force of gravity is remarkable. In the Russian Cosmos/Bion missions many of the effects observed early in flight on vestibular and oculomotor function in nonhuman primates are consistent with response hypersensitivity. Badakva and Kozlovskaya summarized their results in Cohen et al. (2005). Within the first days in orbit gaze shifts to lateral visual targets were hypermetric, despite a reduction in head displacement. This hypermetria caused positional errors and was compensated by an increase in gain of the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) to 1.5 on Day 2 and remained high (2.0) up to Day 8. Associated with gaze hypermetria, response of vestibular nuclei neurons during gaze fixation task gradually increased to a maximum on Day 4, like our present HG data, and returned back to normal for the rest of the 1–2 week flight. Gualierotti and colleagues (Bracchi et al., 1975) directly addressed otolith afferent discharge in μG in technically challenging experiments in the bullfrog. Although the interpretation of their data is difficult, otolith afferent discharge appeared to increase within the first 3 days of the orbital mission and returned to normal at Day 5. Interestingly, this closes matches our HG data after exposure to 2.24 g. The initial reaction in astronauts and animals points to a possible common mechanism. Although it is clearly a speculation, the evidence suggests an exaggerated otolith reaction is evoked to a novel gravity challenge. This challenge occurs in either direction from a loss of gravity in spaceflight to an applied force by centrifugation on the ground. To what extent is this simply a transitory maladaptation or a behaviorally relevant response remains to be determined. Unfortunately, critical data in real-time targeting this initial response to microgram and HG remain lacking. Mechanisms of Utricular Adaption to Gravity We sought to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying utricular adaptation to transitions in gravity levels, particularly hair cell synaptic remodeling and EVS action. Observed changes are thought to reflect the following possibilities: (a) change in transducer sensitivity, (b) temporary structural alteration affecting mechanoreception, (c) pre- or post-synaptic alteration in the strength of synaptic transmission, or (d) neural feedback circuit or efferent copy switched on or off. We examined the latter two possibilities in detail and both attempts brought us no closer to identifying a clear mechanism that initiate and regulate adaptation. (a) Transducer changes. Prolonged deviation of the sensory hair bundle leads to an adaptation of otolith hair cell receptor potentials (Eatock et al., 1987; Goldberg et al., 2012). Manifestation of this adaptation can be seen in responses of some otolith afferents to prolonged steps of linear acceleration (Fernández and Goldberg, 1976a,b). Microgravity might be thought of as a step of hair bundle motion in the “off” direction, and adaptation in transducer mechanism(s) might negate any aberrant afferent response in microgram. The converse might occur in HG. The onset and time course of transducer adaptation might be both rapid and long-lasting, and involve a reconfiguration of the transmembrane channel (TMC)-like proteins of the transducer pore (Pan et al., 2018). Our data do not offer a clear insight. (b) Structural changes of otolith mass. Otolith weight by gravity intensities might regulate the otoconia mass and alter its coupling to stereocilia in a manner that affects mechanotransduction, for example a change of otolith–stereociliary coupling that adjusts bundle deflection for a given movement (Fredrickson-Hemsing et al., 2012). Wiederhold et al. (1997, 2000) showed that the otolith mass in growing snails was increased by microgram exposure. A slowing in otolith growth during development was reported to occur under HG conditions in neonate fish (Anken et al., 2000a), and also after vestibular nerve transection again in neonates (Anken et al., 2000b). However, Lim et al. (1974) and Sondag et al. (1995) in well-controlled studies could not demonstrate any change in the otoconia Ca+2 content, shape, size, or distribution in adult hamsters subjected to HG. More recently, Aceto et al. (2015) found a decrease in otolith calcification after prolonged HG exposure in zebrafish, presumably the result of a regulation of carbonic anhydrase and other matrix protein productions (Anken et al., 2004; Anken, 2006). As bone is adversely remodeled during space missions (Demontis et al., 2017), calcium carbonate on the other hand might be deposited on existing otoconia to provide greater “weight” in an effort to restore the “gain” of gravity sensation; conversely, HG would lead to an ablation of otoconia mass to “rebalance” function. Our afferent recordings did not reveal any aberration(s) in discharge properties or spurious excitations except a change in response sensitivity, implying that if such a mechanism was in operation, the remodeling of the otolith mass was uniformly distributed. Although this mechanism is attractive, particularly for long-term habituation in a reduced gravity, we have no data collected in this study that directly addresses this mechanism. (c) Synaptic plasticity. A widely considered candidate responsible in the adaptive response to microgram is plasticity of hair cell ribbon synapses (Moser et al., 2006). The findings of Ross (2000) promoted this hypothesis: number of ribbon synapses in certain type II hair cells in rat was labile, increasing by approximately 55% following exposure to microgram; type I hair cells were less affected. Toadfish vestibular epithelia possess only type II hair cells and lack the specialized nerve calyx seen in reptiles, birds, and mammals. Also in toadfish the number of en passant and terminal boutons of a given semicircular canal afferent, indicating a potential locus for synaptic coupling to a hair cell, are positively correlated with its response sensitivity (Boyle et al., 1991). Thus, an increase in ribbon synapses in rat utricular hair cells by microgram exposure aligns with our observed post-flight hypersensitivity in toadfish utricular afferents. However, more recent evidence by Sultemeier et al. (2017) in mouse exposed to 15 days of microgram paints a different picture. They found synapse densities decreased, not increased as seen by Ross, in medial extrastriola hair cells and remained unchanged elsewhere in other macula regions and HC cristae. Although one species is likely more susceptible to gravity influences than another based on body mass, this discrepancy between rat and mouse is intriguing but not readily apparent, and must be resolved in future studies. As we discuss below, the picture is even more blurred when we make a direct comparison between recorded response sensitivity and 3D serial reconstruction of synaptic bodies in individual hair cells in the same animal. An important piece of relevant evidence is the time of synapse formation and reformation in inner ear structures. Turnover rate of ribbon synapses in vestibular hair cells is unknown, but some estimates derived from other systems are useful. Ribbon synapses in the visual system of albino rat are said to have a life span of ∼8 h (Spadero et al., 1978) and are structurally plastic particularly in assembly and disassembly processes (Schmidt and Drenckhahn, 1993) during development (Regus-Leidig et al., 2009). In the hippocampus, asymmetric synapses form and disappear within a few minutes (Desmond and Levy, 1986). Although related to different systems, these data indicate that specific times of synapse formation are from minutes to hours (Cragg, 1969; Cotman and Nieto-Sampedro, 1982). Further, Puro et al. (1977) showed that synapses not only turn over but that the rate of turnover increases during development, suggesting that both synapse formation and termination rates are regulated and that the specificity of synaptic connections can be increased by selective termination of synapses. Thus, as sensitivity is decreased to compensate for hyperstimulation, excess synapses will be deactivated by receptor downregulation and “anchors” inside the cell mark the former receptor sites (Ziff and Barry, 2002). Since the sudden change of gravity is an extreme condition, the specific time of synapse rearrangement might be expected to be longer: from hours to several days. Despite the attractiveness of synaptic bodies being added or subtracted as needed to regulate the system response to gravity, a key finding here is in direct opposition to this hypothesis. In the same fish we recorded a substantial afferent population to acceleration in control fish and in fish after 4- or 16-day of 2.24 g exposures, and conducted complete 3D ultrastructural reconstructions of hair cells in the reversal zone of striola and in the predominant medial extrastriola region. Afferents had highly significant differences in Smax (Figure 11A) and average IR per cycle (Figure 11B) with virtually little to no overlap. Even with this clear distinction in utricular physiology, SB counts per hair cell were statistically equivalent in the selected three afferent populations in both macular regions measured in the same fish: hair cells contained on average five to six synaptic bodies, but the variation in number was large (Figure 11C). Afferent Smax also showed a wide variation from less sensitive to highly sensitive within an individual animal, but were distinctly separated as a group from the other populations. The importance of this finding is that the physiological and anatomical results were obtained in the same animal, and no direct correlation was found. It might be argued that the utricular synaptic organization had adapted over the course of afferent recordings. We saw no indication of this: afferents after 4 and 16 days of HG were hyper- and hypo-sensitivity, respectively, from the start to the finish of the recordings and require days to readapt to 1 g. Clearly other factors might be in play. For example, adjustment of synaptic efficacy or strength might involve many processes other than the SB itself, such as Hebbian plasticity based on the correlation of pre- and post-synaptic cells (Matsubara and Uehara, 2016). Suli et al. (2016) have provided some key insights into synaptic plasticity in mechanosensory hair cells. Using transgenic and mutant zebrafish lines they found that innervation was crucial for regulating the number, size, and localization of ribbons in maturing lateral line hair cells, and for their maintenance at the mature synapse. How synaptic weights and innervation patterns might scale up or down or fluctuate in distribution within the hair cell–afferent complexes need to be examined in our model. (d) A neural feedback circuit. It is remarkable that vertebrates exert an efferent (EVS) neural control over the sensitivity, bandwidth, and linearity of sound and motion sensation. In general, the EVS provides hair cell organs not only with the means to control passive filtering of sound and motion signals, but also to regulate the mechanical gain of the living amplifiers in the ear (Hudspeth, 2008; Rabbitt and Brownell, 2011). Efferent cell bodies are located in the caudal brainstem, a phylogenetically ancient structure that monitors and controls vital functions including alertness and arousal. A typical efferent neuron in toadfish has extensive dendritic arbors spanning the brainstem, thereby providing the neuron the capability to receive a wealth of descending command and ascending sensory information (Highstein and Baker, 1986; confirmed in the present study, q.v. Supplementary Figure 3). Spatial coding is likely not selective, since efferent fibers can innervate multiple end organs on one side or even bifurcate within the brain to innervate both labyrinths (Schwarz et al., 1981; Eden and Correia, 1982; Strutz, 1982; Dechesne et al., 1984; Highstein and Baker, 1986; Valli et al., 1986; Dickman and Correia, 1992; Fujino et al., 1993; Marco et al., 1993; Birinyi et al., 2001; Chi et al., 2007). Does the EVS participate in the adaptive processes observed after exposures to HG? We addressed this question indirectly in this study by (1) inferring EVS action on the hair cell by comparing Smax observed in each experimental group (Table 1), (2) inferring EVS action on the afferent by comparing average IR at Smax (IR, in ips/cycle) observed in each experimental group (Table 1), and (3) pairing the MIR (in ips) with and without EVS stimulation in absence of acceleration in the same afferent in each experimental group (Table 2). A more direct measure to determine EVS role in neural adaptation was sought, but not found. For example, axons presumed to originate from efferent neurons were too infrequently encountered and their discharge had no clear variants to permit a meaningful comparison among subjects within or across groups, and the EVS action on afferent sensitivity to acceleration stimuli via its influence on hair cell receptor potential could not be normalized in any meaningful manner, mostly due to the variability in EVS efficacy and frequency of occurrence within each fish. Efferent vestibular system functional role in nonmammalian vertebrates is likely linked to innate behaviors, such as attack and feeding and escape and aversives established for survival of the animal and its reproduction. In toadfish these actions are preceded by a stereotypic behavior, and it is powerfully evoked during the anticipatory phase of production of large, self-generated, and behaviorally relevant movements (Boyle and Highstein, 1984, 1990b; Highstein and Baker, 1985; Tricas and Highstein, 1990, 1991). EVS regulation of afferent sensitivity is likely through its action on hair cell modulation (Flock and Russell, 1976; Boyle et al., 2009; Rabbitt et al., 2010; Rohmann et al., 2015; Poppi et al., 2018). A novel finding supporting the importance of behavioral context in EVS function was recently reported by Chagnaud et al. (2015). In a semi-isolated preparation, which permits identifying the source of incoming signals, of larval Xenopus it was shown corollary discharge signals arising from the spinal central pattern generator cyclically modulated efferent neurons during fictive swimming. During these phasic epochs of efferent signaling, there was a corresponding gain reduction of afferent responses to vestibular-related stimuli. Thus, similar to toadfish, the EVS of Xenopus can effectively optimize sensory processing. No presumed efferent neurons were encountered in the utricular nerve that consistently responded to applied otolith (linear acceleration or body roll/pitch) or canal (yaw rotation or head down/up pitch) stimuli. Given their low discharge at rest and disregard to benign vestibular stimulation, as well as the powerful excitation during preparatory behaviors, efferent neurons likely provide more episodic control over their synaptic targets and not a tonic influence. Recent evidence showed that the EVS could influence VOR plasticity using the α9 knockout mouse model, particularly after destruction of one labyrinth (Hübner et al., 2017). Although in a classical sense the EVS might still provide an underlying tonic drive to its targets, for the sake of argument in the present context a drive that also monitors the prevailing gravity condition, it does not provide cross-talk between otoliths and canals for continuous passive stimuli or influence the output during benign and nonthreatening volitional movements. Viewed from this perspective the EVS endows the toadfish with a powerful means to adjust the sensitivity and dynamic range of motion sensation, and is positioned to monitor prevailing conditions and regulate the gravity sensation (Kondrachuk and Boyle, 2006). However, no direct measurements or indirect inferences from afferent discharge behavior were found here to suggest a clear EVS role in regulating the utricular response to altered gravity. The information content provided by the efferent feedback signal in diverse conditions may be more complex and involve a novel self-regulation of synapses induced by changes in input signals in altered gravity.",

Copyright notice ID: 6204554 PMID: 30405430 Abstract Gravity has remained constant during animal evolution and the neural sensory systems detecting acceleration forces have remained remarkably conserved among vertebrates. The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound effects on how an organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1–32-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1–8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent vestibular pathway. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228°/s constant angular velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Afferents studied after 228°/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without centripetal acceleration, called On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their control counterparts. Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3–4 days followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after 16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the same fish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found. Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g resembles in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms. Keywords: afferents, hair cells, acceleration, gravity, centrifugation, spaceflight, electrophysiology, serial electron microscopy reconstructionIntroduction Gravity is a natural force that drives all living organisms to acquire precise physiological mechanisms to survive. Throughout the course of a species’ evolution the intensity and direction of gravity have remained constant, whereas other environmental factors, such as predation, climate, vegetation, for example, with rare exceptions have not. The highly evolved inner ear neural systems in vertebrates are keyed to operating under gravity’s continuous influence (Stensiö, 1927; Friedman and Giles, 2017). Detections of inertial acceleration, such as linear translation during self-motion or an external perturbation, and head orientation with respect to gravity, such as tilts, start from the bilateral otolith organs. The first vertebrate ear was principally a graviceptive statocyst more commonly found in today’s aquatic invertebrates (Budelmann, 1988). Otolith structures contain an inertial mass of calcium carbonate that is subject to the pull of gravity and thus possesses weight. In an earlier study (Boyle et al., 2001) fish were exposed to near weightlessness in spaceflight and in this study we exposed the fish to centrifugation to enhance the gravity load and queried in a similar fashion the sensory processing characteristics of otolith afferents. Pervasiveness of gravity provides the nervous system a common reference about which to optimize sensory transduction mechanisms and perception. Otolith afferents carry the transduced signal of the gravito-inertial forces in the form of modulated spacing of action potentials to the brainstem and cerebellum (see Goldberg et al., 2012). There the otolith code combines with angular acceleration signals obtained from the semicircular canals and with information derived from the visual and somesthetic modalities to compute a central representation of the body and its parts as well as their dynamics in space. The end result is the resolution of ambiguity of gravity and self-motion to allow healthy individuals to maintain balance and equilibrium under varying conditions. Despite invariability of gravity on Earth, physiological systems are not and are adversely affected by trauma, disease, and aging, and thus central creation of the gravito-inertial vector can be disrupted leading to vertigo, disorientation, and other clinical disorders. Arrival of aviation and space age offered a means to directly study the role of gravity in healthy subjects. The established reference of self-orientation is now completely violated by the speed at which the individual and visual world on the retina move and by rapidly changing orientation of the gravity vector with respect to the pilot, or removal of gravity vector altogether in space missions. During the first days of spaceflight, most astronauts experience symptoms of space motion sickness and disorientation (Reschke et al., 1994; Demontis et al., 2017) linked to the otolith organs (Watt et al., 1986; Paloski et al., 1993; Heer and Paloski, 2006). An extraordinary hypersensitivity to applied acceleration was observed in toadfish utricle afferents after relatively short mission aboard Shuttle orbiters (Boyle et al., 2001). The hypersensitivity presumably was the result of exposure to near weightlessness, persisted over the first day after landing, returned to within normal levels on the second day at 1 g, and closely matched the reported readaptation in astronauts after landing following a comparable stay in space (Reschke et al., 1994). Physiological adjustments to a novel gravity, as witnessed in spaceflight, reveal that the organism possesses adaptive mechanisms triggered by transitions in gravity. What initiates these mechanisms and are they compensatory to the gravity load? In addition to the sensory afferent pathways the brain in turn sends efferent signals back to the same inner ear structures. Activation of olivo-cochlear efferent neurons can attenuate afferent sensitivity and reduce its frequency selectivity or tuning to sound (Warr and Guinan, 1979; Liberman, 1980; Groff and Liberman, 2003). In functional terms, this efferent-to-afferent feedback loop adjusts sensitivity of hearing in a frequency dependent way (Brown et al., 1983; Russell and Murugasu, 1997). Analogous to the cochlea, efferent synaptic terminals contact both vestibular hair cells and afferents (Smith and Rasmussen, 1968; Sans and Highstein, 1984; Holstein et al., 2004; Lysakowski and Goldberg, 2008), and activation of efferent synapses influences afferent sensitivity in fish (Flock and Russell, 1976; Hartmann and Klinke, 1980; Boyle and Highstein, 1990b; Boyle et al., 2009), frog (Gribenski and Caston, 1976; Valli et al., 1986; Chagnaud et al., 2015), turtle (Brichta and Goldberg, 2000; Holt et al., 2006), bird (Dickman and Correia, 1992), chinchilla (Marlinski et al., 2004), and primates (Goldberg and Fernández, 1980; Sadeghi et al., 2009). Reflex or self-generated movements often have large purposeful acceleration components, such as those occurring during predation (attack) and avoidance (escape) behaviors that would impair the computation of a movement, and importantly any novel perturbations encountered during execution of those behaviors. To enable the afferent to continuously encode motion profiles during such overt behaviors its sensitivity to acceleration is reduced, often dramatically, but it is not clear whether the prevailing gravity load is registered by the efferent system and participates in adaptive processes. Another possible participant in adaptive processes in the peripheral labyrinth is a rapid addition or removal of synaptic bodies associated with the hair cell-afferent synapse. Ross (2000) found the number of synaptic ribbons in rat type II otolith hair cells increased two to threefold following 14-day exposure to weightlessness. Since toadfish possess only type II hair cells, an attractive interpretation of our earlier afferent data (Boyle et al., 2001) was an increase in synaptic strength as an initial adaptive response to restore the “lost” gravity detection, followed by a deletion of the added synaptic bodies (Waites et al., 2005; Matthews and Fuchs, 2010; Graydon et al., 2017) leading to a restoration of normal sensation after a return to 1 g. Here, we manipulate the afferent responses to acceleration by applying variable exposures to hypergravity (HG) via centrifugation and directly correlate the observed afferent sensitivity with serial reconstruction of hair cell-afferent complexes in two areas of the utricular macula in the same animal.Materials and Methods General Procedures Oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, of either sex, weighing ∼400 g, were provided by the Resources Facilities of Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA, United States). Fish were housed in 300 l saltwater aquaria systems (AquaLogic, San Diego, CA, United States) and monitored daily by the veterinarian staff. All procedures followed the principles set forth by  “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Ed 8” and approved by NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Useful data were acquired from 106 fish. Immediately after removal from the centrifuge aquarium (<1 min) the fish was immersed in the anesthetic agent MS222 (25 mg/l, 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States) diluted in saltwater (Instant Ocean®). Fish was then placed in a Lexan polycarbonate tank filled with chilled (15°C) saltwater, and its head was stabilized in an Earth horizontal plane using a mouth brace and immobilized with stainless steel pins to the cranium; saltwater covered all but its most dorsal surface, and its eyes and dorsal fins were covered with moist tissues. Saltwater was aerated using an air stone. MS222 was added as needed during the course of the experiment. A small craniotomy was made to visualize the anterior and horizontal canal (HC) ampullae and the utricle and their specific nerve supply. Fluorocarbon (FC75, 3M Corp, Minneapolis, MN, United States) was injected into the cranial opening to fill the perilymphatic vestibule. The dorsal surfaces of the brainstem and posterior cerebellum were exposed by removing ∼3 mm2 portion of occiput above the foramen magnum. Efferent vestibular nuclei are seen as paramedial gray areas among the transversely running internal arcuate fibers under the floor of the IVth ventricle (Highstein and Baker, 1986). A pair of sharpened Ag/AgCl wires insulated to within 0.2 mm of their tips and spaced ∼2 mm was lowered into the efferent nuclei on either side of the midline along a ∼45° angle beneath the posterior cerebellum to a depth of 1–2 mm. EVS activation behaviorally provoked or electrically induced elicits an early arousal reaction, characterized by an initial flaring of lateral fins and raising of dorsal fin, followed by straightening of the tail and extension of the ventral fins (Highstein and Baker, 1985; Boyle and Highstein, 1990b). Fin flaring was used as a guide for proper placement of electrode array that required the lowest shock intensity. Alert fish activate their EVS at a maximum rate of ∼100 impulses/s (ips) (Highstein and Baker, 1985), and efferent nerves faithfully follow a 100 Hz stimulus train applied to the nuclei (Boyle and Highstein, 1990b). EVS stimulation consisted of single pulses of 100 μs duration with trains of 100/s were delivered in a bipolar fashion via a pulse generator coupled to a stimulus isolation unit and captured as time-stamped events in Spike2 (CED, United Kingdom). Conventional 30–50 MΩ glass microelectrodes, filled with 2 M LiCl2, were used for extracellular or pseudo-intra-axonal recordings under direct visual control. The recording session began less than 1 h after cessation of centrifugation and typically lasted 12–14 h. In preliminary experiments, we noticed utricular afferents were inconsistently responsive to EVS stimulation, while at the same time HC afferents were consistently activated. Therefore, responses of ∼5–10 HC afferents were recorded at the start of each session to adjust and confirm efferent stimulation parameters. Sinusoids of 10–20°/s at 0.5–5 Hz were delivered about the z-axis (yaw rotation) as well as visual localization to identify canal afferents. Consistency of stimulus intensity was verified throughout the experiment. Another set of canal afferents (range 8–27) was recorded at the end of each session to confirm EVS efficacy and evaluate canal response to rotation.Centrifugation Procedures NASA Ames prototype centrifuge was used to subject the fish to HG of variable duration and magnitude (Figure 1A). The centrifuge consists of four radial arms with a one-degree of freedom swing gondola (labeled A1) at the end of each arm to maintain gravity vector relative to the fish during rest and centrifugation and positioned 1.22 m eccentric to center of rotation. Two magnitudes of HG were applied. Main protocol was a 38-rpm spin delivering a 1 g (Earth) plus 2 G (centripetal) force imparting a 2.24 g (=sqrt(12 + 22)) resultant force. Duration of 2.24 g exposures was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 16, 24, or 32 days in groups of four to five fish. In separate experiments, the spin was reduced to 19 rpm resulting in a 1 g centripetal force or 1.12 g (=sqrt(12 + 12)) resultant force; duration of 1.12 g exposures in groups of four fish was confined to 4 and 16 days. Loading and unloading of fish were scheduled to minimize the stop time, typically <10 min. Twelve separate runs were conducted over a 3-year period to acquire the reported HG results. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Experimental and testing devices. (A) Ground-based centrifuge was used to apply centripetal force by constant velocity rotation within a concomitant 1 g environment. Centrifuge had four gondolas (labeled A1) positioned at a radial distance of 1.22 m from center of axis of rotation. Each gondola was gimbaled with one-degree of freedom to deliver a constant gravity vector onto fish at any given rotational rate. Self-contained aquarium systems (labeled A2) were developed to permit life support for one fish in each gondola consisting of mechanical and biological filtrations, cooling, and oxygenation within a 12:12 light:dark cycle. Fish were unrestrained during centrifugation and their behavior was captured in light using video. (B) Acceleration testing device was designed and fabricated to study afferent responses to controlled translational motions delivered along the tandem rails labeled B6 and B7 at any head orientation via yaw rotation controlled by motor labeled B3. The motor labeled B4 delivered tilt stimulation from pitch to roll. See text for more details.Fully sealed fish tanks were fabricated from 1.3-cm Plexiglas® tubes of 30.5-cm dia capped at both ends, and with a molded, sealable opening on the curved surface to permit access to the fish. An individual habitat (labeled A2) was placed in each gondola, contained ∼20 l of saltwater and housed either one fish or none at a time (for scheduling). A closed loop system continuously circulated water through mechanical and biological filtrations and a heat exchanger to chill the saltwater to 15°C on the return side. The room was cooled to <15°C to counter heat generated by the motor. A DC powered air stone aerated the saltwater, and pressure was released via a one-way valve. Light/dark (12:12 h) cycles during centrifugation were normalized to home aquaria. Fish were unrestrained and allowed to swim freely in the habitat. During centrifugation, two forces are applied to the fish in addition to the constant force of gravity: a centripetal force dependent on radius of eccentricity and rate of rotation. To account for possible variations in vestibular function due to rate of rotation, a separate rate table was configured that permitted a single tank to be placed precisely at the center of rotation axis. These On-Center Control (OCC) experiments were conducted one fish at a time with a spin of 38 rpm for groups of four fish at either 4- or 16-day duration. All parameters were matched to the centrifuged fish with the exception that no (or negligible) centripetal force was imparted to the fish. Fish were monitored in the light cycle using video. No off-nominal events occurred during any test. Acceleration Testing Device After surgical preparation the tank (labeled B1) was mounted to a multi-axis linear and angular acceleration and tilt system (Figure 1B). Head position of the fish was adjusted to align the otoliths coplanar to Earth horizon using digital commands to one or more axes. The cranial opening was positioned beneath a castle-like structure on which a three-axes remotely controlled motorized micromanipulator (MP-285; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, United States) and preamplifier were fixed. The fish tank and castle-like platform were attached to a Plexiglas® plate (labeled B2) supported by a 15.24-cm dia thrust bearing and attached to a stepper motor (labeled B3) geared (55:1) at 90° (graphically illustrated) to provide a full rotation about the vertical z-axis (yaw); one stepper count equals 0.00026°. This axis allows smooth positioning from one head angle to another with respect to the translational axis to examine afferent directional selectivity, together with applied yaw rotational stimuli. Its center of rotation passed through the center of the head and bilateral labyrinths. Yaw stage was mounted to a 2.54-cm dia shaft through roller bearing pillow blocks to a stepper motor (labeled B4) straight geared (55:1); one stepper count equals 0.00026°. This axis allowed tilt about the axis coplanar to the Earth horizontal (graphically illustrated), and provided either static positioning or dynamic stimuli at angles between pure roll and pure pitch depending on the head angle command to the yaw motor. Next, the tilt stage was attached to a base plate (labeled B5) through roll bearing pillow blocks and stepper motor mount. The base plate was attached to a thrust block brushless linear motor (not visible in Figure 1B), which was in turn mounted to a 165-cm precision linear bearing guidance system (IDC, Petaluma, CA, United States) (labeled B6); a non-contact, incremental linear encoder provided a position sensing with 10 μm accuracy and voltage proportional to instantaneous linear velocity was derived from the servo controller; this signal was integrated in Spike2 data acquisition software to obtain a derived acceleration signal. A second, slaved rail, and linear bearing gliders (labeled B7) were coupled to the thrust block to provide additional stability and lower the center of mass of the top plate. The device was secured to an optical breadboard (TMC) (labeled B8) to ensure flatness and provide isolation, and floated from the lab floor by jelly pads to absorb substrate-borne vibrations. Unit recording stability was confirmed up to 0.5 g at 12 Hz (maximum tested). A digital controller (Galil Motion Control, Rocklin, CA, United States) installed on a Windows-based platform provided command signals to each motor. Software control was based on Galil motion control libraries called from a user interface written in Igor (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, United States) scripts to permit step or continuous, dynamic motion about one or more axes at selectable parameters.Terminology of Motion Stimuli Lab-defined frame of motion reference along the horizontal axis at 0° corresponded to a positive acceleration directed forward out the fish’s snout; activation of the tilt stage (Figure 1B, B4) at this position delivered a pure roll to one side or the other. Activation of the yaw stage (Figure 1B, B3) produced counter-clockwise (CCW) or CW rotation in the horizontal plane to change the head orientation with respect to the linear motion. Yaw rotation of the platform to + 90° (right-hand rule, CCW) about the z-axis produced a positive inter-aural acceleration directed out the right (ipsilateral to recording side) ear and the converse out the opposite ear, and activation of the tilt stage produced a pure pitch with either head-down or -up. Yaw rotation of the platform to 180° about the z-axis produced a positive sled acceleration directed forward but now out the fish’s tail, and activation of the tilt stage produced again a pure roll to one side or the other. Yaw rotation of platform to 270° about the z-axis produced a positive acceleration directed out the left (contralateral to recording side) ear and the converse out the right ear, and activation of the tilt stage produced again a pure pitch. Sinusoidal translation along the horizontal plane ranged from 0.03 to 0.3 g at 0.3–5 Hz and was limited by the excursion of the rail; sinusoidal tilt stimuli ranged from 0.01 to 2° at 0.3–10 Hz and up to 5° static tilt and the parameters tested were dependent mainly on recording stability; sinusoidal yaw rotations were confined to 10–30°/s at 0.1–5 Hz.Vestibular Test Protocol Test protocol was designed to provide direct comparisons of afferent responses to translation within and across the populations subjected to different HG and adaptation conditions. Secondarily, tilt stimuli were used to extend the response characteristics. The hair cell’s bundle is morphologically polarized (Wersäll, 1972) and its receptor potential is directionally sensitive and behaves as a rectified cosine-function to bundle displacement (Hudspeth and Corey, 1977; Shotwell et al., 1981); the functional polarization vectors of utricular afferents are distributed in a fanlike shape (Fernández and Goldberg, 1976b), as is to be expected from the hair cell orientations in the macula (Spoendlin, 1964). Afferent directional selectivity was defined by its maximum (Smax) and minimum or null (Smin) sensitivities. To accomplish this a sinusoidal translation along a plane parallel to Earth was delivered as the fish was rotated about the yaw or z-axis (Angelaki and Dickman, 2000; Boyle et al., 2001) and paused to collect five or more consecutive cycles. In our standard test protocol, a 1–2 Hz translational sinusoid was delivered at amplitude of ±0.02–0.05 g as the fish was stepped about the z-axis in typically successive 15° steps. Test magnitude was set to prevent as well as possible any nonlinear distortions of afferent impulse rate (IR) such as saturation in the ON-direction or “cut off” in the OFF-direction. In successful recordings, the afferent Smax and Smin to translation were captured within five to nine steps; in some cases, the Smin was not obvious (discussed later in the section “Results”). In many cases the recording was compromised before completing the required protocol and the data were discarded. In afferents with particularly stable recording conditions static and dynamic tilts were delivered, selected often at the z-axis angle that elicited its Smin and Smax responses to translations. Static tilts were typically ±1–3° displacement (12°/s2 ramp on/off) and were held to determine the time course of impulse adaptation. In some instances afferent directional selectivity was determined for both translations and tilts.Data Acquisition and Analysis Data waveforms and events were digitized, displayed in real-time using Spike2 software, and stored for later analysis (CED Power 1401). Direct voltage measures of angular displacements (in degree) about the two (yaw and tilt) rotational axes, acceleration (cm/s2) from the linear encoder and the derived velocity (cm/s), and the linear accelerators (g) along the horizontal plane were amplified externally to span the full 16-bit range of the A/D converters, filtered below the Nyquist frequency, and digitized at 500–1000 samples/s. Time stamping for stimulus trigger events, efferent shock times, and externally discriminated spike times was acquired to a resolution of 0.08 ms. Data were imported off-line into a custom interactive analysis procedure written in Igor. Desired portions of record with respect to specific stimuli were manually selected and inspected using an interactive graphical analysis procedure. A stimulus trigger (positive zero-crossing) was used as a time reference to generate 100–180 bin/cycle phase histograms of stimulus and response. A discrete Fourier analysis was applied to compute the first-harmonic stimulus/response amplitude and phase. Response sensitivity (afferent output/stimulus input) was calculated by dividing IR modulation of derived 1st harmonic of modulation by acceleration amplitude, e.g., impulse rate (IR) per second (ips) per cm/s2 or g (9.81 m/s2) linear acceleration; response phase is angle between output and input peaks in ° using the lab-defined reference. A cosine function was applied to data in a method following (Angelaki, 1991; Angelaki et al., 1993) to determine degree of spatial tuning, directional selectivity, and response maximum (Smax) and its minimum (Smin). Some afferents are silenced over a portion of the stimulus cycle. In the least squares fitting procedure bins lacking data were not assigned a value of zero, and therefore the curve fit was not influenced by a truncated response. This form of response nonlinearity may lead to a misrepresentation of data because a portion of the curve fit will take negative values. When detected in real time, the stimulus was reduced in amplitude to permit a more full-cycle impulse modulation. Despite these efforts and the need to maintain comparable stimulus parameters for capturing Smax response saturation and silencing of the discharge were often unavoidable. Both the mean IR, defined as IR at half of computed peak-to-peak modulation, and the average IR, defined as number of impulses divided by stimulus cycle time, were measured. The former IR assists in detecting large truncated or clipped responses and the latter took into account the different cycle time of sinusoids used and served as a more reliable measure of IR during stimulation. Samples of IR >30 s in length (from 120 to >36,000 interspike intervals) in the absence of stimulation were taken to describe the afferent background impulse properties. Degree of regularity was evaluated by determining the non-normalized coefficient of variation (CV) of rate, defined as the standard deviation of interspike intervals divided by mean interval. An example of protocol for characterizing afferent responses in control and experimental fish to linear acceleration (panels A–C) and to tilt (panel D) is given in Figure 3. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Uricular afferent response properties. (A) Recorded data of afferent response in control fish show IR modulation to sinusoidal linear acceleration at 2 Hz collected over time from 301 to 305.5 s. Traces from top to bottom: (1) yaw position of fish (set at 90°). (2) Linear acceleration of sled in ±cm/s2. (3) Linear velocity of sled in ±cm/s. (4) Instantaneous IR in impulses per second (ips). (B) Data in A were averaged and displayed as phase histogram; upper trace is unit IR (ips) and lower trace is stimulus acceleration (LA) in g (dotted curves represent the 1st harmonic fit to the stimulus and response). (C) Directional selectivity of utricular afferents. Responses were analyzed at 21 separate orientations of fish in space shown in the abscissa from 0° (positive linear acceleration directed in horizontal plane out fish’s snout) to accelerations directed in horizontal plane out fish’s right (90°) or left (270°) ear and at orientations in between. Cartoons give at five positions of fish to help visualize the stimulus. Maximum response (in ips/g) was calculated at each orientation and plotted as a function of head angle (in °). A cosine function (red curve) was applied to data to determine degree of spatial tuning, directional selectivity, and response maximum (Smax) and its minimum (Smin). In this example Smax was 3234 ips/g at 90° (comparable at 270°) and afferent was highly spatially tuned (Smin/Smax = 0). (D) Responses of same afferent to sinusoidal tilt simulation at 2 Hz, ±0.11° displacement. Format is same as in C. Upper trace gives a broad description of stimulus, from Roll with Right ear down at 0°, Pitch with Nose down at 90°, Roll with Left ear down at 180°, and Pitch with Tail down at 270°. Yellow vertical line between C and D is given to provide the 90° offset of the two stimuli by the lab-defined coordinate scheme, and how closely the responses match. Smax for tilt was 801 ips/° at 7° head angle, and the spatial tuning was tight (Smin/Smax = 0.04).Statistical afferent data analyses were performed using built-in one-way ANOVA packages in Igor (v.7) and KleidaGraph (v. 4.5) with post hoc analysis (Tukey’s all pairs comparison test). Data are presented throughout as the mean ± SD as single group and compared as paired data using Student’s t-test and levels of statistical probability are two-tailed values. Differences were considered significant for p < 0.05.Histology At the end of each experiment a small opening was made in the dorsal aspect of the anterior canal limb, and a glass pipette with ∼50 μm opening was inserted into canal lumen and directed rostrally toward the anterior ampulla. The pipette was attached to a 1 ml syringe, and the endolymph was flushed with fixative solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sucrose, and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Perfusate was colorized using alcian blue to visualize it flowing across the anterior ampulla, entering the utricular space and duct, and exiting via the common crus from the distal end of the cut canal limb. The utricle and a portion of its nerve were extracted, and the utricle was opened to expose the macula and immersed in fixative overnight. Maculae were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide with 1.25% potassium ferrocyanide, dehydrated, infiltrated, and embedded in Epon. Blocks were sectioned using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome in 1-μm thick sections for surveying and 180 nm sections for analysis.Synaptic Body Counts To provide uniformity of synaptic body (SB) counts within our samples and allow direct comparison with a previous work, a protocol based on Ross (2000) was used. The Epon block was cut in 1 μm sections along the short axis of macula to survey the start of the striola border. Once confirmed 100 sections at 1 μm thickness were collected for a separate morphometric evaluation. From that point 150 serial sections of 180 nm thickness were collected to characterize the striola region on both sides of the hair bundle reversal line; a separate comparable collection of serial thin sections was obtained 150 μm medially to characterize the medial extrastriola zone of the macula. Sections were collected individually, mounted on Butvar-coated slot grids, and studied with a Leo 912 AB transmission electron microscope. More details on the ultrastructure of the toadfish utricle and the three-dimensional reconstruction of hair cells can be found in Boyle et al. (2018). Each sample was coded to prevent detection of treatment (control or HG) and experiment day. Digital mosaics were made using the Olympus Soft Imaging System MegaView III digital camera at 5000× (microscopic) magnification from every seventh section and the hair cells were numbered. Mosaicked sections served as maps for locating and identifying the numbered hair cells in non-mosaic sections. Every hair cell on every section (mosaic and non-mosaic) was examined for presence of synaptic bodies and hair cell-afferent synapses. Sections were initially analyzed at 8000× magnification, and suspected synapses were enlarged to 12,500× for validation (see Figures 2A,B). Digital images of all likely synaptic bodies were taken and coded with a number for the section, hair cell, and number of synapses present. A low power image (4000×) was also taken for better cell identification on the map. Combined data were used to accept or reject probable synaptic bodies. Synapses or other structural features of interest were also photographed at this time. Images were transferred to an SGI Onyx for permanent storage and further synapse analysis. For counting, synapses were recorded on sheets of paper on which there are numbered contours of identified hair cells, with the numbers matching those on the maps. Strict criteria for counting synaptic bodies were followed. Only structures consisting of a central, electron-opaque body (presynaptic density), and a halo of vesicles were counted. Panels A and B in Figure 2 show digital images of two consecutive sections separated by section thickness of 180 nm. Arrows in each panel point to the same single SB in the hair cell. Figure 2C shows a cartoon of 2 of the 10 hair cells on either side of the reversal line in the striola as an illustration of method used in tabulating the results. Greater than 90% of synaptic bodies are single specializations along the hair cell internal wall, followed by pairs of bodies, and rarely a cluster of three or more bodies. Because of the time required to perform this task, typically 3–4 months full-time effort per macula, SB counts were done from selected fish in which extensive physiological data were first obtained. Synaptic ribbons in utricular hair cells were analyzed using the ANOVA and MANOVA features of SuperANOVATM software. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Method to identify and count synaptic bodies (ribbons) in utricular hair cells. (A, B) Two consecutive transmission electron microscopic images (12,500× magnification) reveal the same SB (arrow in each panel) in the hair cell. Scale bar, 1 μm. (C) Two-dimensional cartoon of method used to tabulate and characterize the unique synaptic bodies in each hair cell reconstructed in 3D from 150 serial sections of 180 nm thickness. Two 100 μm width patches separated by 150 μm in striola (shown with the reversal line) and medial extrastriola regions of macula were examined in same fish in which afferent recordings were collected. Sections were viewed at 500–20,000× to verify synaptic bodies within the section and carried over into adjacent sections. Synapse characterization is based on following criteria. Single body: most common and do not share synaptic vesicles with nearby bodies if present. Pair: less common with two synaptic bodies sharing vesicles on one section, or adjacent sections. Group: least common with ≥3 bodies sharing vesicles on one section, or across multiple serial sections.Results Control Responses to Translational Accelerations and Tilts in Normal Gravity Response properties of utricular afferent were studied in control fish housed in 1 g to establish baseline measures needed for direct comparison within and across fish exposed to the different experimental conditions. A representative utricular afferent behavior in control fish to linear acceleration (panels A–C) and to tilt (panel D) is given in Figure 3. Orientation of the fish about the z-axis (Yaw Position in A) was set at 90° to provide a positive acceleration directed out the fish’s right ear along the inter-aural axis ipsilateral to the recording site. Nine consecutive cycles of sinusoidal linear acceleration (±15.7 cm/s2 or ±0.016 g) at 2 Hz were recorded (A) and averaged (B) to give a response of the following characteristics: averaged modulation was ±51.7 ips about a fitted rate of 47 ips, with a sensitivity of 3.3 ips/cm/s2 or 3234 ips/g occurring at peak phase of -134° re: acceleration. Average IR was 41 ips/cycle indicating a slight silencing of its rate in the OFF-direction. This response represented the afferent Smax. Afferent directional selectivity, a critical parameter to measure across experimental fish to precisely establish Smax, the spatio-temporal characteristics of averaged data at different head angles are plotted in Figure 3C. Cartoons of fish show the direction of +linear acceleration at five different fish orientations. Smax (Figure 3C) is the uppermost point (solid circle) on the yellow line. Rotation of fish about the z-axis from Smax at 90° head angle (Figures 3A,B) by half-circle to 270° head angle elicited a comparable and expected Smax along the inter-aural axis but with a 180° phase shift due to the lab-specific denotation. Peak of response modulation with respect to peak acceleration amplitude typically remained consistent over a hemi-field of head angles, rectified as the polarity shifted in the lab-defined coordinates, and showed variable leads to lags. Data were fit by a rectified (temporal or phase of response; black curve superposed on open circle symbols of phase re: acceleration) cosine (amplitude of modulation) function (red curve in Figure 3C superposed on solid blue circle symbols of gain data). Note the rise and fall of gain in a cosine fashion as the fish’s orientation was shifted from inter-aural accelerations to accelerations directed out the fish’s snout or tail. The afferent was tested for nearly 360° change in orientation at 21 separate head angles. The fitted nulled value of 0 for Smin (e.g., Smin/Smax = 0 in the example in Figure 3C) reflected the sharpness of directional tuning and the correspondence between tested (filled and open circles) and fitted (red and black curve) responses was sharp. Same afferent’s responses to tilt stimuli at 2 Hz, ±0.16° displacement, were recorded in a similar fashion at 23 separate orientations to determine Smax and Smin to tilt (D). Smax was 801 ips/° and nearly aligned to pure roll tilt as expected from the inter-aural responses to linear acceleration. Smin was near a complete null (32 ips/°) response predicted from the Smax to linear acceleration (yellow line) at both nose down (Pitch-N) and tail down (Pitch-T) pitch tilts, and the Smin/Smax ration was 0.04. Note the congruency between the responses to the two stimuli: Smax for linear acceleration (in C) was directed along the inter-aural axis out the right ear and Smax for tilt (in D) occurred at pure roll with right ear down. Similarly, Smin for linear acceleration occurred in forward or backward movements and Smin for tilts occurred in pure nose down or up pitches. Afferent responses presented in Figure 3 are representative of 162 afferents recorded in 12 control fish, and Table 1 summarizes the principal findings (bottom row). Averaged Smax was 2103 ± 1314 ips/g (or 2.02 ± 1.39 ips/cm/s2) and directional selectivity was tightly tuned, having an Smin/Smax ratio of 0.085 ± 0.14 (range 0.0–0.48l, n = 81). Value in parentheses in Table 1 is number of afferents in which a clear Smin was also captured. One-half (n = 81 out of 162) of control records had a distinct Smin. To be included in the calculation of Smax at least five or more tests covering 75–90° head angles were tested and a clear maximum on a cosine function was evident. Often Smin was captured, but the recording was compromised before Smax response was reached and thus omitted from analysis. Figure 4 shows the topographical structure of the utricular macula (A) and distribution of recorded head angle at its Smax for the 162 control afferents (filled black circles) in a polar plot. Head angle at Smax occurred at virtually all angles in 2D space (±180°) in control fish, averaged 95 ± 82° (Table 1) and represents an acceleration directed out the ipsilateral (right) ear as expected for prevalence of afferents supplying the large medial extrastriola (asterisk) macula evident in Figure 4A. Table 1. Physiological characteristics of toadfish utricular (Utr) afferents to sinusoidal translation acceleration as a function of duration and magnitude of exposure to HG and readaptation to 1 g. Open in a new tab Twenty-three (23) experimental groups (rows) were tested to controlled translational acceleration in the Earth horizon plane. Nine groups are identified by the duration of exposure, e.g., 1D indicates one (1) day (D) of exposure, to a constant resultant centripetal acceleration of 2.24 g; two groups of either 4 or 16 days of exposure to 1.12 g; five groups of 4 days of exposure to 2.24 g followed by 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 days of recovery (Rec) in normal 1 g; four groups of 16 days of exposure to 2.24 g followed by 2, 4, 6, or 8 days of recovery in normal 1 g; two groups are identified as OCC by either 4 or 16 days of exposure to 38 revolution per minute without an appreciable centripetal acceleration; and the last group is standard laboratory control fish. Columns provide the number of utricular afferents in each group (total of 4233 afferents); response Smax of response at the afferent’s preferred direction (in impulse/s/g, or ips/g); Smin of response over the Smax as a measure of directional selectivity (number in parentheses gives the number of afferents having a verified Smin); head angle (in degree, °) at Smax; and IR at Smax (in impulse per second per cycle time). Last three columns are data obtained from number of HC afferents (N =), their average IR per cycle time of yaw rotation, and their averaged response sensitivity in ips/°/s of angular yaw rotation. Rows highlighted in red are early significant hypersensitivity (Smax) responses and adaption rate, and row highlighted in blue are later significant hyposensitivity (Smax) responses and adaption rate. Values are mean ± SD. Significance (ANOVA): ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.005, or ∗∗∗p < 0.0001.FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Sampling bias consideration. (A) Low magnitude scanning electron micrograph of the left utricular macula was flipped 180° to correspond to the right utricle for comparison with data in B. View from above rostral is up and medial is left (see key in upper left corner). Utricular macula is outlined in yellow, the reversal line in striola region is in red; more details of the utricle morphology can be found in Boyle et al. (2018). From left to right (medial to lateral): large medial extrastriola (asterisk), a striola zone on either side of the reversal line (red line), and a relatively narrow lateral extrastriola region approaching the ampullae of the anterior (AC) and horizontal (HC) semicircular canals. Hair bundle on each hair cell is morphological polarized and broadly depicted as blue arrows pointing from the shortest stereocilia to the kinocilium, and the polarization flips at the reversal line (red line). (B) Afferent responses (ips/g) are plotted in a polar graph as a function of head angle (°) at Smax for control fish and for fish exposed to 2.24 g for 4 or 16 days. Head angle at Smax of recorded responses was consistent for all fish, indicating no evidence of sampling bias from one region to another or between experimental groups. Right-hand rule was used, and 0° is + acceleration out the fish’s snout, 90° out the ipsilateral (right) ear, 180° out the fish’s tail, and 270° out the contralateral (left) ear (depicted in upper right corner in A). Also note that the majority of afferents recorded in these three separate conditions showed responses aligned to innervating hair cells in the medial extrastriola.Measured values of Smax (range 149–7326 ips/g) and IR (range 8–102 ips/cycle; mean 40 ± 19 ips; n = 162) covered a broad range among control afferents. Despite the variability a weak, but significant, positive correlation was found between the Smax and IR (Figure 5A; paired correlation, R = 0.25; n = 162). Control mean IR (MIR) at rest had an even weaker, but nevertheless significant, negative correlation (paired correlation, R = -0.11; n = 107) with its degree of regularity of interspike interval as measured by coefficient of variability or CV (mean 0.53 ± 0.22; range 0.1–1.4; n = 107). As a result, Smax was positively correlated with CV (paired correlation, R = 0.28; n = 107), and thus broadly speaking an afferent having a high sensitivity to acceleration, a high IR during acceleration and rest, and a more irregular spacing of its interspike intervals at rest. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Correlation of response sensitivity and discharge properties in fish exposed to different levels of HG. A positive and significant (p < 0.001) correlation persisted between Smax (ips/g) and average IR at Smax (ips/cycle) for the 162 control afferents (A), the 153 afferents tested after 4 days at 2.24 g (B), and the 177 afferents tested after 16 days at 2.24 g (C).Figure 6 shows two afferent responses to static and dynamic tilt. Afferent in panel A is a continuation of record of the same afferent illustrated in Figure 3. At the beginning of the record (see arrow pointing to insert) sinusoidal tilts at 2 Hz, ±0.16°, were delivered over seven cycles at a head angle of 345°, within 22° (and 15° from pure roll) from the calculated head angle at Smax, and the afferent showed a modulation of ±112 ips, or a unit gain of 680 ips/°, that peaked at 43°. After ∼25 s of rest the fish was tilted 3° right (ipsilateral) side down. As expected from the response to dynamic tilts, IR was elevated by ∼125 ips and showed a fast and slow time course of response decay of 4.3 and 44.6 s, respectively. Returning the fish back to initial horizontal position (near the 250 s mark) and then tilting it from the horizontal position (near the 425 s mark) to (-) 3° left (contralateral) side down suppressed the IR that recovered back near rest in a similar manner. A right-down tilt back to original horizontal position produced a comparable excitatory response. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Different afferent behaviors to tilt in control fish. (A) Robust responses to both dynamic and static tilt displacements in control afferent. Upper trace is tilt displacement (in °) and lower trace is instantaneous IR (ips) over a continuous recording of ∼750 s. Insert shows an expanded portion early in the record during 2Hz, ±0.16°, sinusoidal tilt. Tilt stimulus was delivered at a head angle of 345°, or nearly a pure roll stimulus, with right side (positive values) down and ipsilateral to recorded afferent. Static displacements were delivered at the same head angle starting with right side down and hold, a tilt in the opposite direction to normal horizontal position and hold, a left side down and hold, and a return tilt in the opposite direction to normal horizontal position and hold. Fast (red curve) and slow (yellow curve) time constants of return to baseline IR were seen in the excitatory direction of tilt. Tilt stimuli in the opposite direction, contralateral to recording site, silenced the afferent in both instances. (B1) Different control afferent has a response to dynamic, but not static, tilt displacements. Same format as A. Sinusoidal 2 Hz tilts (±0.14°) were delivered before and after ±3° static displacements and are marked B2 and B3. Phase histograms in panels B2 and B3 show the corresponding averaged modulation of 332 and 260 ips/°, and peak modulation lead position by 9.4 and 17.4°, respectively, respectively. During static displacements at the afferent Smax of 135°, midway between left side down roll and tail down pitch, afferent maintained a near constant IR of 41–45 ips (labeled on tilt trace).Although responses to sinusoids and static tilts corresponded well in most tested afferents (n = 22), there was considerable variability in response to static tilt in nearly the same number of afferents (n = 18) that were responsive to translational accelerations. An extreme example is given in Figure 6B. In B1 sinusoids were presented at 2 Hz (±0.14°) both before (labeled B2) and after (labeled B3) a similar sequence of ±3° tilts in both directions spaced by returns to normal horizontal position. The fish was oriented at a head angle of 135°, and thus tilts were delivered midway between roll and pitch, corresponding to afferent Smax for dynamic tilt. Numbers associated with each step orientation ranged from 41 to 45 ips over the selected period, indicating the afferent was unresponsive to ±3° static displacements but responsive to ±0.14° displacements when presented as sinusoids. Because of this variability in tilt responses, comparisons within and across the HG experimental groups were based on afferent responses to translational acceleration.Control Responses to Efferent Vestibular System (EVS) Stimulation in Normal Gravity Utricular afferent response to EVS activation was in general comparable to that observed in HC afferents in the same species (Boyle and Highstein, 1990b): elevation in IR and reduction in response sensitivity. As mentioned in the section “Materials and Methods,” we found that EVS activation was less prevalent in utricle than in HC recordings. To ensure efficacy of stimulation within each experiment we first recorded HC afferents to adjust placement and intensity of EVS pulses. Of the 112 HC afferents recorded and tested to EVS stimulation, only 13 (12%) were unresponsive. Table 2 gives the action of EVS stimulation on IR of control utricular afferents (bottom row). Of the 32 afferents in which EVS activation could be paired to the same afferent’s IR at rest only ∼one-third (37%) were responsive whereas 63% of the afferents were unresponsive in the same preparations as the HC recordings. The effective action of EVS stimulation on utricular afferents was a near doubling of IR from 37.1 ± 23.7 to 62.8 ± 30.5 ips, without altering CV (0.6 ± 0.32 at rest and 0.58 ± 0.31 during EVS excitation). Table 2. Physiological response of utricular afferents to electrical activation of efferent vestibular system (EVS). Open in a new tab Same groups are given in Table 1. Columns provide the number of afferents in each group with paired control and EVS responses; the MIR at rest (ips); coefficient of variability (cv) at rest as a measure of the degree of regularity of interspike interval; MIR (ips) during EVS stimulation; cv measure during EVS stimulation; absolute change in IR during EVS stimulation above IR at rest; and the percent change in IR response (%R). Red highlights the significant elevation of the IR during EVS stimulation; blue highlights the significant depression of the IR during EVS stimulation. Significance (ANOVA): ∗p < 0.05 or ∗∗p < 0.005.Afferent modulation to a linear acceleration can be profoundly influenced by EVS activation. Figure 7 shows disruption of response to a 2 Hz sinusoidal linear acceleration of ±24.4 cm/s2 (or ±0.025 g) by EVS activation via a shock train applied to the brainstem (A) or self-generated by the fish itself (B). In the absence of EVS activation the afferent had an averaged response modulation of ±6.3 ips (±0.26 ips/cm/s2 or ±252 ips/g) centered about an IR of 7.2 ips that was temporarily altered by the brief epoch of EVS stimulation. When EVS action was less pronounced, afferent rate was elevated while at the same time its response modulation was decreased but not abolished. Record in Figure 8A shows instantaneous IR (unit, in ips) and raw voltage record (in mV) for 2 Hz ± 0.24° sinusoidal tilt of the fish rotated 90°, thereby delivering pure roll (±right down/left up) stimuli. EVS stimulation elevated IR 4.5-fold from 11.8 ips (B, control cycles) to 51.9 ips (C), while halving response modulation from 11.6 ips (or 63.6 ips/°; B, control cycles) to 7.4 ips (or 31.4 ips/°; C). Mean percent reduction in response sensitivity to linear acceleration in 27 tested utricular afferents was 56.7 ± 24.1 (range 18–88%; afferents in which the response was completely abolished were not included in this calculation). During a more steady state level of EVS activation after the initial onset of EVS pulses, the temporal relation of response modulation to stimulus (phase in ° with respect to peak °) was unaffected, similar to that seen in HC afferents (Boyle and Highstein, 1990b). However, the response to acceleration over any portion of the stimulus cycle can be dramatically altered during short bursts of EVS activation, such as the records in Figures 7A,B and the two brief epochs shown in the first portion of record in Figure 8A. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Electrically evoked (A) or self-generated (B) efferent vestibular system (EVS) activation elevates afferent rate and reduces or even blocks its response to linear acceleration. In the absence of EVS activation afferent showed an averaged response of 2 Hz linear acceleration. During a brief pulse train of EVS stimulation (A), afferent IR was elevated and its response to applied acceleration disrupted. This result is also seen when the fish activated the EVS on its own as seen in the two epochs in B. Self-generated epochs of EVS activation excite the afferent with differing patterns and alter its response to an applied perturbation. Traces in A and B are from top to bottom instantaneous firing rate (Unit, ips), EVS pulse train, raw voltage of afferent (mV), and the applied linear acceleration (LA, in cm/s2).FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab EVS activation elevates IR and partially shunts afferent response to linear acceleration. (A) Afferent response to 2 Hz (±0.24°) sinusoidal pure nose-down pitch in absence and presence of electrical EVS stimulation. Segment of record without EVS stimulation (time ∼350 s) is highlighted in blue box in A and the corresponding averaged response histogram is given in B; a similar portion of record in A is captured during EVS stimulation and highlighted in yellow box and its corresponding averaged response histogram is given in C. (B) During control cycles, afferent responded with a ±15.5 ips modulation about a discharge rate of 11.6 ips, and averaged ±63.6 ips/° and a phase lag re: position of –39°. (C) During cycles with combined EVS stimulation, modulation dropped by ∼50% to ±7.4 ips, now centered about an elevated discharge rate of 51.9 ips, and averaged sensitivity was reduced by about one-half to 31.4 ips/° and the phase lag (–34°) remained unaffected in the selected portion of the record. Traces in A from top to bottom: position of yaw axis at 90° during tilt stimulus corresponding to roll tilt, instantaneous firing rate (in ips), EVS epochs, and raw voltage of afferent (in mV). (B, C) Averaged responses from selected portions of the record in A. Ordinates in B and C are equivalent to show the elevation in discharge rate and reduction of response modulation (see text for further explanation).Utricular Afferent Responses to Acceleration in On-Center-Control (OCC) Condition During centrifugation, the fish was exposed to both a centripetal force dependent on its eccentricity and constant rotations per minute (rpm) and the constant force of gravity. A separate device was used to place the fish precisely at the center of rotation thereby matching as well as possible all parameters except now in the absence of centripetal force. Fish were exposed to either 4 or 16 days of rotation at 38 rpm. As listed in Table 1, the OCC utricular afferents behaved statistically identical in all measured parameters after both 4-day (N = 226 afferents) and 16-day (N = 177 afferents) to the control fish not exposed to any experimental condition prior to recordings. In the insert in Figure 9B Smax (in ips/g) of individual responses are plotted as a function of percent within each control group, and shows the complete overlap of OCC afferents with their control counterparts. FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab Effect of reduced and enhanced gravity on maximum response sensitivity (Smax) of utricular afferents. (A) Data were collected after microgram exposure on STS-90 and -95 orbital shuttle missions (modified Figure 3 of Boyle et al., 2001). Percent plot shows the afferent Smax as a function of time after landing in hours from first (10–16 h) to last (112–117 h) recording session. Within the first day after landing, Smax (red circles) to an applied linear acceleration was significantly (p < 0.01; ∗) greater than for controls (solid black line). Sensitivity returned to near normal values after ∼30 h following landing, as revealed by the data collected in the same fish at varying hours of delay after landing and indicated by separate symbols. (B, insert) OCCs at 4 and 16 days of exposure to 228°/s (38 rpm) constant angular velocity to mimic the rotation during 2.24 g centrifugation are plotted in four fish each together with non-rotated control afferents. Smax was indistinguishable in the three control groups and revealed no influence of rotation alone on response behavior of utricular afferents (insert). (B) Mean Smax of control afferents to a standard translation is 2103 ± 1314 (SD; n = 162) ips/g, and their responses lie on the solid black trace in percent plot. Afferent responses within each group for designated days of 2.24 g (1 day, 2 days, …) exposures are given with separate symbols and traces as indicated in the key. A significant elevation of Smax at 3-day (n = 228 afferents) and 4-day (n = 153 afferents) was observed (p < 0.0001; ∗∗∗); 90–100% of the afferents in these groups had a markedly greater Smax than the 162 control afferents. The elevation was followed by several days (5 to ≥8 days) of normal afferent sensitivity and then by a significant decrease at 16-day (n = 245 afferents; p < 0.0001; ∗∗∗), 24-day (n = 177 afferents; p < 0.005; ∗∗), and 32-day (n = 192 afferents; p < 0.005; ∗∗). Number of afferents recorded in each group is given in parentheses.Horizontal Canal Afferent Behavior in Normal and Altered Gravity: Internal Control Horizontal canal afferents recorded in control fish in normal gravity (n = 58) behaved in an identical manner to that previous reported in toadfish (Boyle and Highstein, 1990a). Table 1 (right columns) gives the consistent averaged IR during sinusoidal yaw rotation (in ips/cycle) for 58 control HC afferents, 162 HC afferents in On-Center-Control (OCC) afferents, 604 HC afferents recorded after 1–32 days of 2.24 g centrifugation, 518 HC afferents recorded after 4 or 16 days of centrifugation followed by a recovery period, and 97 HC afferents recorded after 4 or 16 days of 1.12 g centrifugation. Despite the wide range of duration and intensity of the experimental conditions, HC afferent IR was unaffected. Horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were also unaffected by the experimental conditions (q.v. Supplementary Figure 1). HC afferents exhibit a wide range of response dynamics and can be broadly termed as low or high gain velocity encoding and acceleration encoding afferents (Boyle and Highstein, 1990a), and the prevalence of each afferent population and its response characteristics were equivalent under all experimental conditions. Table 1 (right columns) gives the averaged response sensitivity (in ips/°/s) of HC afferents to a 0.5–1 Hz (±10–15°/s) sinusoidal angular yaw rotation for each experimental group. No significant difference was observed in response and IR to rotation among the recorded afferents, suggesting there was no broad, non-descript action on the periphery during the experimental tests. In conclusion, behavior of HC afferents serves as an internal control of variables associated with centrifugation, such as the duration (1–32 days) of 1.12 or 2.24 g centrifugation, length of recovery to normal gravity (1–8 days), and constant angular rotation without centripetal force (OCC) used in the present study.Utricular Afferent Responses to Acceleration and Tilt Following 2.24 g Exposure Principal reaction to HG was an adjustment of response sensitivity as a function of the magnitude and duration of exposure (q.v. Supplementary Figure 2). Reaction was bi-phasic starting with a significant twofold increase in Smax after 3 (N = 228 afferents) and peaked at 4 (N = 153 afferents) days of exposure (highlighted in red in Table 1), with a return to normal values after 5 (N = 148 afferents) and 8 (N = 196 afferents) days of exposure, and then followed by a significant reduction by ∼one-third after 16 (N = 245 afferents), 24 (N = 177 afferents), and 32 (N = 192 afferents) days of exposure to 2.24 g (highlighted in blue in Table 1). The Smin/Smax ratio remained the same on average for all populations within and across the wide range in experimental conditions. Interestingly, significant changes were observed in average IR at Smax (in ips/cycle; Table 1): average IR was reduced at 2D prior to the sensitivity increase at 3D, and stayed at a 20–40% lower level from 5D to 32D despite the significant changes in Smax over these periods of 2.24 g exposures. Records from the 4- and 16-day fish confirmed that the Smax of the majority of afferents, like their control counterparts, occurred at head angle associated with a positive acceleration directed out the ipsilateral labyrinth (Figure 4B, Table 1). In addition, the positive correlation of Smax and average IR (Figures 5B,C) was maintained after exposures to HG, even with a significant reduction in both Smax and average IR recorded in the 16-day fish (Table 1). Correlations within each group between MIR (ips) and CV and, in turn, Smax were also maintained at the same level of confidence. Data obtained in recovery periods to 1 g from 1 to 8 days after HG indicated that average IR set point was restored after 2 days in normal gravity. It is important to note that HC afferents recorded in each experimental group not only were unaffected in terms of response modulation to yaw rotation as mentioned above, but also had an average IR (41 ± 21 ips/cycle) equal to that of utricular control afferents (40 ± 19 ips/cycle) that remained consistent under all experimental conditions (right two columns of Table 1).Utricular Afferent Responses to Acceleration Following 1.12 g Exposures In a separate, and smaller, sample afferents were studied after 4 or 16 days of HG at one-half the resultant force as the larger sample. A significant elevation in Smax (3274 ± 2113; N = 184 afferents; p < 0.0001, ANOVA) was observed after 4-day exposures to 1.12 g (highlighted in red in Table 1), about half way between control Smax and 4D 2.24 g Smax. Although a reduction in Smax was seen on average in 183 afferents studied after 16-day exposures, it was not statistically significant. All other parameters of response to acceleration and IR properties were unchanged.Comparison of Utricular Afferent Responses to Acceleration Following Micrograms and 2.24 g Exposures Utricular afferents exhibited a profound hypersensitivity when tested to translation upon return to Earth after 9–16 days of microgram exposure on two shuttle orbiter missions and a recovery back to normal after several days (Boyle et al., 2001). These data are given in the percent plot in Figure 9A. Nearly 60% of the afferents tested within 10–16 h after landing (solid red circles) were significantly (p < 0.005) more sensitive than control afferents (solid black line). To put this in perspective an afferent for example had a near saturating IR modulation of ±30 ips for a 1.6 Hz stimulus at an amplitude of ±0.0026 g, in essence a minute vibration that otherwise would be mostly ineffective in eliciting a modulation. Figure 9B gives a percent plot of afferent Smax to translation for control fish (solid black line and insert) and for those after exposure to varying duration of 2.24 g from 1 to 32 days in a comparable manner to Figure 9A for comparison. Initial hypersensitivity was most evident in afferents after 3 (solid orange circles) or 4 (solid red circles) days of 2.24 g exposures, and the separation of Smax from control population was nearly 100%. Responses in these exposures unmistakably resembled those seen initially after space travel and were unexpected. Smax recovered within normal levels at the 5- and 8-day tests before a significant Smax reduction was observed after 16–32 days of 2.24 g exposures (Table 1). Mean Smax (ips/g ± SD) of the experimental data presented in Figure 9B are plotted against days of exposure to 2.24 g in Figure 10A. Interestingly, afferent characteristics across the three (16-, 24-, and 32-day) groups displaying a Smax hyposensitivity was statistically similar (ANOVA), suggesting a plateau had been reached at this stage of the adaptation process. FIGURE 10. Open in a new tab Afferent Smax as a function of days of exposure to 2.24 g and readaptation after return to normal 1 g environment. (A) Histogram plots the mean afferent Smax (ips/g ± SD) (same data as shown in Figure 9B) against time of exposure to centrifugation (in days). (B) Histogram plots afferent Smax as a function of number of days (indicated by number inside of each column) in normal 1 g after 4- and 16-day exposures to centrifugation to the return to baseline levels. Initial hypersensitivity recorded immediately after 4-day exposures (solid red unlabeled column) required >4 days to recover to control levels. The later hyposensitivity observed after 16-day exposures (solid blue unlabeled column) required at least 2 days to recover. In each panel error bars are ±SD, the left column labeled C is the control response values, and asterisks designate the level of significance of p < 0.05 (∗), p < 0.005 (∗∗), and p < 0.0001 (∗∗∗) to control measures.Re-adaptation of Afferent Response After Return to Normal Gravity Figure 10B provides a summary histogram (same format as Figure 10A) of Smax in afferent populations initially exposed to 4 or 16 days of 2.24 g and returned to 1 g until a restoration of normal activity was established. Early hypersensitivity observed after 4 days at 2.24 g took >4 days to recover to control levels, and the later hyposensitivity observed after 16 days at 2.24 g recovered more quickly and required >2 days in 1 g to recover to control levels. Thus, the bi-phasic hyper- to hypo-sensitivity to translations after centrifugation reflected an adaptive process that was restorable with a delay to its original state.Possible Mechanism(s) of Afferent Adaptive Processes to Altered Gravity: Efferent Action By inference afferent sensitivity is expected to lessen or IR to rise or both when EVS is activated episodically or in a steady state; conversely, the removal of a steady state EVS action could lead to an afferent sensitivity increase and IR could remain the same or even decrease. Comparing the results in Table 1 it could be inferred that the early increase and later decrease in Smax was due to an OFF and On EVS action on the hair cell alone, respectively, without a direct action on the afferent. EVS action on afferent rate was almost exclusively excitatory (Figures 7, 8) from the axo-dendritic synapse on the afferent and not through the axo-somatic synapse on the hair cell (Boyle et al., 2009). No consistent evidence emerges from pairing Smax and IR to support a direct systematic EVS role on afferent processing after centrifugation. Table 2 tabulates the magnitude and prevalence of response of EVS activation for paired data within each test group. With only one exception, EVS pulses significantly elevated as expected the IR (EVS IR) above the MIR of background IR in all groups. The sole exception was the afferent group subjected to 32 days at 2.24 g (32D 2.24 g). Here, afferent response to EVS activation was noticeably infrequent with only 11.2% responding (against 37.2% in control afferents), and noticeably weaker with a difference of EVS to non-EVS epochs or IR (ΔEVS) significantly less (6.9 ± 14.9 ips) than that for control afferents (25.7 ± 17.6 ips). These findings at the 32-day mark are not consistent with the significant Smax reduction (Table 1). In the same vein, the afferent response to EVS pulses after 4 days at 2.24 g (4D 2.24 g) was more prevalent with 62.3% responding with significantly greater ΔEVS (43.8 ± 38.1 ips) than that for control afferents. These findings suggest that EVS action was greatly enhanced at 4-day mark, but again the action is not consistent with the significant Smax increase (Table 1). At the present stage it is not possible to establish direct causality of afferent IR and response behavior after HG exposures and EVS action.Possible Mechanism(s) of Afferent Adaptive Processes to Altered Gravity: Synaptic Remodeling Afferent response sensitivity and hair cell synaptic organization were examined in the same animal to determine the possible causality between response magnitude and number of synaptic bodies. Figure 11 shows percent plots of Smax (A, in ips/g) and average IR (B, in ips/cycle) in three groups: controls (black solid circles and line; N = 2), 4 days at 2.24 g (red solid circles and line; N = 2), and 16 days at 2.24 g (blue open circles and line; N = 2). Importantly, highly significant differences in response sensitivity were found in the same fish from which SB counts were taken. In Figure 11A, Smax was significantly higher (p < 0.0001, ANOVA) in 4-day (4945 ± 2823 SD imp/s/g; two fish; n = 93) and significantly lower (p < 0.002, ANOVA) in 16-day (1245 ± 1097 SD imp/s/g; two fish; n = 89) fish from controls (2045 ± 1314 SD imp/s/g; two fish; n = 39). In Figure 11B, the average IR at Smax (in ips/cycle) also differed: rate was significantly lower (p < 0.01, ANOVA) in 16-day (28 ± 15 SD ips/cycle), and higher, but not significantly so, in 4-day (46 ± 21 SD ips/cycle) fish from control afferents (39 ± 24 SD ips/cycle). Figure 11C gives the results of hair cell SB counts in the same fish from which afferent responses were obtained (Figures 11A,B). Number of SB per 100 μm2 was determined for two macular regions, one straddling the reversal line in the striola (shaded columns) and the other 150 μm away in the medial extrastriola (solid columns), in controls (black) and fish exposed to 2.24 g for 4 (red) or 16 (blue) days. On average SB count per hair cell was 4–7 in the two macular regions in each experimental group, and ranged in number from 1 to 13 (n = 223) in control medial extrastriola, 1 to 25 (n = 505) in control striola, 1 to 20 (n = 520) in 4-day medial extrastriola, 1 to 22 (n = 484) in 4-day striola, 1 to 16 (n = 253) in 16-day medial extrastriola, and 1 to 20 (n = 575) in 16-day striola regions. Variability within each group was large and thus, despite the high number of hair cells completely reconstructed in three dimensions, single and multiple SB densities in the two macular regions were not significantly different between control and HG fish. This is in stark contrast to the clear separation in afferent physiology. FIGURE 11. Open in a new tab Direct comparison of physiology of afferents as a function of duration of exposure to 2.24 g to synaptic organization of hair cells in the same fish. (A) Percent plot of Smax shows significantly higher Smax in 4-day (4945 ± 2823 SD imp/s/g; n = 93) and significantly lower Smax (p < 0.002) in 16-day (1245 ± 1097 SD imp/s/g; n = 89) fish from controls (2045 ± 1314 SD imp/s/g; n = 39). (B) The average IR (in ips/cycle) during acceleration at Smax also differed between afferents in these groups: rate was significantly lower in the 16-day (28 ± 15 SD ips/cycle), and higher, but not significantly so, in 4-day (46 ± 21 SD ips/cycle) fish from the control afferents (39 ± 24 SD ips/cycle). Level of significance (ANOVA): p < 0.0001 (∗∗∗), p < 0.002 (∗∗), and p > 0.01 (∗). (C) Number of synaptic bodies per hair cell was determined using 3D computerized serial reconstruction techniques at transmission electron microscopy level from 150 sections of 180 nm thickness from two macular regions, one straddling the reversal line (shaded columns) and the other 150 μm away in the medial extrastriola (solid columns), in control fish (black) and fish exposed to 2.24 g for 4 (red) and 16 (blue) days. Average (±SD) number of synaptic bodies is given above each column. Number (n =) of completely reconstructed hair cells used in this analysis was large and ranged from 223 to 575 hair cells as indicated. Variability within each group was very large and thus, despite the high number of reconstructed hair cells, SB densities in the two macular regions were NOT significantly different between control and centrifuged fish despite the highly significant differences in their responses to acceleration.Discussion As a necessary first step in determining the role of the utricle in neural adaptation to novel gravity loads, otolith afferents were studied to establish benchmarks for comparison within and across the experimental groups. Vestibular afferents, both semicircular canal (frog: Honrubia et al., 1989; toadfish: Boyle and Highstein, 1990a; Boyle et al., 1991; bird: Landolt and Correia, 1980; chinchilla: Baird et al., 1988; cat: Anderson et al., 1978; squirrel monkey: Fernández and Goldberg, 1971; rhesus monkey: Schneider et al., 2015) and otolith fibers (cat: Loe et al., 1973; pigeon: Si et al., 1997; primates: Fernández and Goldberg, 1976a,b,c; Angelaki and Dickman, 2000; Jamali et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2012) differ from one another in their discharge patterns and response properties to adequate stimuli. As seen in other species toadfish utricular afferents showed a wide range of discharge rates, regularity of discharge, and response sensitivity to sinusoidal linear acceleration with a typically tight degree of directional selectivity. The physical basis for differences in response dynamics among otolith afferents is not fully understood, and determining the precise signals originating from different regions of the utricular macula and how these signals enter central otolith reflex pathways have been a challenge. Afferent dendritic organization to the type of hair cell (type I and/or type II) it supplies varies in complexity (see review by Goldberg et al., 2012; Boyle et al., 2018), and it is reasonable to assume that hair cell excitation is not uniform (Spoon et al., 2011; Curthoys et al., 2017). In chinchilla utricle about three-fourths of recorded afferents displayed a more regular discharge of their interspike intervals (Goldberg et al., 1990a,b), and corresponds to about three-fourths the total area of macula designated as the medial extrastriola. Toadfish utricle is structurally similar in the broad sense to other species, including amniotes and other anamniotes, and its hair cell polarization is highly organized across the more 2D macula surface (Boyle et al., 2018). Like the chinchilla, toadfish medial extrastriola occupies about three-fourths the total macula area (Figure 4A) and reflects the responses of the majority of afferents recorded in this study (Figure 4B). Unlike the chinchilla, regularity of discharge of toadfish utricular afferents span a continuum but three-fourths of them are more irregularly discharging. An attractive hypothesis is that vestibular afferent inputs are matched to the dynamic requirements of the various reflexes they target (Highstein et al., 1987; Boyle et al., 1992; McArthur and Dickman, 2008), and evolutionary pressures drive the particular behaviors (Nilsson, 2013; Straka and Baker, 2013; Straka et al., 2014). In this scheme, the prevalent irregular utricular afferents are best matched to the control requirements of the rapid attack and escape avoidance of toadfish. Utricular Afferent Responses After Microgravity (μg) Exposure From the earliest manned orbital missions we know that changes occur in processing of gravitational information during adaptation to microgram and re-adaptation to 1 g upon return to Earth. The adaptive mechanisms to altered gravity might be confined to the peripheral sensory structures or involve central processing centers or likely require the participation of both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Within the first day after STS-90 and -95 shuttle landings, a response hypersensitivity to acceleration stimuli was observed in utricular afferents (Figure 9A; Boyle et al., 2001). Reduced gravity in orbit during these relatively short microgram exposures apparently resulted in an upregulation of afferent sensitivity. Time course of return to normal sensitivity in toadfish afferents paralleled the reported decrease in vestibular disorientation in astronauts after return from shuttle missions (Reschke et al., 1994). Although belonging to a distinct group of animals, recordings taken directly from gravitoreceptors of the land snail (phylum Mollusca), and thus no intervening synapse as in afferent recordings, after exposures of 12–16 (Balaban et al., 2011) and 30 (Aseyev et al., 2017) days in space also showed a pronounced response hypersensitivity to tilt. In a complimentary study in tilapia the gain of an otolith-related vestibuloocular reflex was significantly increased within the first postflight week, and returned to control levels in the second postflight week, of space missions (Sebastian et al., 2001). Orbiting space stations provide a platform to extend human presence in space and capture the physiological response(s) to longer duration of exposures. Hallgren et al. (2016) measured in 1 g the ocular counterrolling (OCR), an otolith-mediated reflex, during centrifugation before and after a 6-month stay in space in 25 astronauts and found a significant reduction in OCR magnitude after landing and its restoration to normal levels in 9 days. Their results are largely in agreement with changes in gaze control reported by Kornilova et al. (2012) in cosmonauts to 129–215 days in space. Adaptation to microgram is likely to change over time from an initial over compensation to restore normalcy to a hyposensitivity more in line with the prevailing gravity. Do the processes of adaptation to microgram in orbit or weightlessness in deep space missions reach a plateau or continue to evolve in time are questions yet to be answered.Utricular Afferent Responses After Hypergravity Exposure Based on the robustness of postflight hypersensitivity of utricular afferents, we expected to find a compensatory hyposensitivity in response to HG. The initial hypersensitivity was unexpected and developed at Day 3 and peaked at Day 4. It was followed by a period of normalcy and then the development of the anticipated hyposensitivity after 16–32 days of HG. Initial hypersensitivity was robust and recovered to normal levels after ∼4–6 days at 1 g. Utricular afferent response to HG did not reflect a systemic action on the labyrinth as a whole, since HC afferents were consistently normal in response and discharge properties and remained independent of level and duration of HG in the same fish. OCCs performed at 4- or 16-day exposure to 228°/s (38 rpm as in 2.24 g runs) constant angular velocity were identical in all measures to their utricular and canal afferent counterparts in non-rotated controls. Video taken during the light cycle did not reveal any aberrant behavior during the different exposures of 2.24 g, perhaps suggesting a central compensatory mechanism in operation. Of prime importance is the fact that in the same species we have the neural response to microgram and a more comprehensive evaluation of the neural response to HG. These results demonstrate that the utricle undergoes continuous plasticity based on magnitude of the prevailing gravity and suggest the possibility that the process of re-adaptation from HG exposure might mimic the process of adaptation to microgram. The organism’s response to transitions in gravity is not simply a step increase or decrease, but varies with time of exposure to the new level of force. Majority of astronauts experience mild-to-severe disorientation for 3–4 days upon initial exposure to microgram, a condition akin to terrestrial motion sickness (Reason and Brandt, 1975). Even though most humans eventually adapt after days to microgram, return to 1 g causes vestibular dysfunction (Reschke et al., 1994; Oman, 1998; Black et al., 1999). The behavior (Anken and Rahmann, 1998) and otolith afferent response sensitivity (Boyle et al., 2001) of fish follow a comparable course of readaptation after landing and therefore restoration to normalcy is likely a general reaction of the organism to short duration (weeks) exposure to microgram. Our data (Figure 10) confirm that readaptation also occurs in afferent response to HG. The organism’s early response to an abrupt change in the force of gravity is remarkable. In the Russian Cosmos/Bion missions many of the effects observed early in flight on vestibular and oculomotor function in nonhuman primates are consistent with response hypersensitivity. Badakva and Kozlovskaya summarized their results in Cohen et al. (2005). Within the first days in orbit gaze shifts to lateral visual targets were hypermetric, despite a reduction in head displacement. This hypermetria caused positional errors and was compensated by an increase in gain of the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) to 1.5 on Day 2 and remained high (2.0) up to Day 8. Associated with gaze hypermetria, response of vestibular nuclei neurons during gaze fixation task gradually increased to a maximum on Day 4, like our present HG data, and returned back to normal for the rest of the 1–2 week flight. Gualierotti and colleagues (Bracchi et al., 1975) directly addressed otolith afferent discharge in μG in technically challenging experiments in the bullfrog. Although the interpretation of their data is difficult, otolith afferent discharge appeared to increase within the first 3 days of the orbital mission and returned to normal at Day 5. Interestingly, this closes matches our HG data after exposure to 2.24 g. The initial reaction in astronauts and animals points to a possible common mechanism. Although it is clearly a speculation, the evidence suggests an exaggerated otolith reaction is evoked to a novel gravity challenge. This challenge occurs in either direction from a loss of gravity in spaceflight to an applied force by centrifugation on the ground. To what extent is this simply a transitory maladaptation or a behaviorally relevant response remains to be determined. Unfortunately, critical data in real-time targeting this initial response to microgram and HG remain lacking.Mechanisms of Utricular Adaption to Gravity We sought to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying utricular adaptation to transitions in gravity levels, particularly hair cell synaptic remodeling and EVS action. Observed changes are thought to reflect the following possibilities: (a) change in transducer sensitivity, (b) temporary structural alteration affecting mechanoreception, (c) pre- or post-synaptic alteration in the strength of synaptic transmission, or (d) neural feedback circuit or efferent copy switched on or off. We examined the latter two possibilities in detail and both attempts brought us no closer to identifying a clear mechanism that initiate and regulate adaptation. (a) Transducer changes. Prolonged deviation of the sensory hair bundle leads to an adaptation of otolith hair cell receptor potentials (Eatock et al., 1987; Goldberg et al., 2012). Manifestation of this adaptation can be seen in responses of some otolith afferents to prolonged steps of linear acceleration (Fernández and Goldberg, 1976a,b). Microgravity might be thought of as a step of hair bundle motion in the “off” direction, and adaptation in transducer mechanism(s) might negate any aberrant afferent response in microgram. The converse might occur in HG. The onset and time course of transducer adaptation might be both rapid and long-lasting, and involve a reconfiguration of the transmembrane channel (TMC)-like proteins of the transducer pore (Pan et al., 2018). Our data do not offer a clear insight. (b) Structural changes of otolith mass. Otolith weight by gravity intensities might regulate the otoconia mass and alter its coupling to stereocilia in a manner that affects mechanotransduction, for example a change of otolith–stereociliary coupling that adjusts bundle deflection for a given movement (Fredrickson-Hemsing et al., 2012). Wiederhold et al. (1997, 2000) showed that the otolith mass in growing snails was increased by microgram exposure. A slowing in otolith growth during development was reported to occur under HG conditions in neonate fish (Anken et al., 2000a), and also after vestibular nerve transection again in neonates (Anken et al., 2000b). However, Lim et al. (1974) and Sondag et al. (1995) in well-controlled studies could not demonstrate any change in the otoconia Ca+2 content, shape, size, or distribution in adult hamsters subjected to HG. More recently, Aceto et al. (2015) found a decrease in otolith calcification after prolonged HG exposure in zebrafish, presumably the result of a regulation of carbonic anhydrase and other matrix protein productions (Anken et al., 2004; Anken, 2006). As bone is adversely remodeled during space missions (Demontis et al., 2017), calcium carbonate on the other hand might be deposited on existing otoconia to provide greater “weight” in an effort to restore the “gain” of gravity sensation; conversely, HG would lead to an ablation of otoconia mass to “rebalance” function. Our afferent recordings did not reveal any aberration(s) in discharge properties or spurious excitations except a change in response sensitivity, implying that if such a mechanism was in operation, the remodeling of the otolith mass was uniformly distributed. Although this mechanism is attractive, particularly for long-term habituation in a reduced gravity, we have no data collected in this study that directly addresses this mechanism. (c) Synaptic plasticity. A widely considered candidate responsible in the adaptive response to microgram is plasticity of hair cell ribbon synapses (Moser et al., 2006). The findings of Ross (2000) promoted this hypothesis: number of ribbon synapses in certain type II hair cells in rat was labile, increasing by approximately 55% following exposure to microgram; type I hair cells were less affected. Toadfish vestibular epithelia possess only type II hair cells and lack the specialized nerve calyx seen in reptiles, birds, and mammals. Also in toadfish the number of en passant and terminal boutons of a given semicircular canal afferent, indicating a potential locus for synaptic coupling to a hair cell, are positively correlated with its response sensitivity (Boyle et al., 1991). Thus, an increase in ribbon synapses in rat utricular hair cells by microgram exposure aligns with our observed post-flight hypersensitivity in toadfish utricular afferents. However, more recent evidence by Sultemeier et al. (2017) in mouse exposed to 15 days of microgram paints a different picture. They found synapse densities decreased, not increased as seen by Ross, in medial extrastriola hair cells and remained unchanged elsewhere in other macula regions and HC cristae. Although one species is likely more susceptible to gravity influences than another based on body mass, this discrepancy between rat and mouse is intriguing but not readily apparent, and must be resolved in future studies. As we discuss below, the picture is even more blurred when we make a direct comparison between recorded response sensitivity and 3D serial reconstruction of synaptic bodies in individual hair cells in the same animal. An important piece of relevant evidence is the time of synapse formation and reformation in inner ear structures. Turnover rate of ribbon synapses in vestibular hair cells is unknown, but some estimates derived from other systems are useful. Ribbon synapses in the visual system of albino rat are said to have a life span of ∼8 h (Spadero et al., 1978) and are structurally plastic particularly in assembly and disassembly processes (Schmidt and Drenckhahn, 1993) during development (Regus-Leidig et al., 2009). In the hippocampus, asymmetric synapses form and disappear within a few minutes (Desmond and Levy, 1986). Although related to different systems, these data indicate that specific times of synapse formation are from minutes to hours (Cragg, 1969; Cotman and Nieto-Sampedro, 1982). Further, Puro et al. (1977) showed that synapses not only turn over but that the rate of turnover increases during development, suggesting that both synapse formation and termination rates are regulated and that the specificity of synaptic connections can be increased by selective termination of synapses. Thus, as sensitivity is decreased to compensate for hyperstimulation, excess synapses will be deactivated by receptor downregulation and “anchors” inside the cell mark the former receptor sites (Ziff and Barry, 2002). Since the sudden change of gravity is an extreme condition, the specific time of synapse rearrangement might be expected to be longer: from hours to several days. Despite the attractiveness of synaptic bodies being added or subtracted as needed to regulate the system response to gravity, a key finding here is in direct opposition to this hypothesis. In the same fish we recorded a substantial afferent population to acceleration in control fish and in fish after 4- or 16-day of 2.24 g exposures, and conducted complete 3D ultrastructural reconstructions of hair cells in the reversal zone of striola and in the predominant medial extrastriola region. Afferents had highly significant differences in Smax (Figure 11A) and average IR per cycle (Figure 11B) with virtually little to no overlap. Even with this clear distinction in utricular physiology, SB counts per hair cell were statistically equivalent in the selected three afferent populations in both macular regions measured in the same fish: hair cells contained on average five to six synaptic bodies, but the variation in number was large (Figure 11C). Afferent Smax also showed a wide variation from less sensitive to highly sensitive within an individual animal, but were distinctly separated as a group from the other populations. The importance of this finding is that the physiological and anatomical results were obtained in the same animal, and no direct correlation was found. It might be argued that the utricular synaptic organization had adapted over the course of afferent recordings. We saw no indication of this: afferents after 4 and 16 days of HG were hyper- and hypo-sensitivity, respectively, from the start to the finish of the recordings and require days to readapt to 1 g. Clearly other factors might be in play. For example, adjustment of synaptic efficacy or strength might involve many processes other than the SB itself, such as Hebbian plasticity based on the correlation of pre- and post-synaptic cells (Matsubara and Uehara, 2016). Suli et al. (2016) have provided some key insights into synaptic plasticity in mechanosensory hair cells. Using transgenic and mutant zebrafish lines they found that innervation was crucial for regulating the number, size, and localization of ribbons in maturing lateral line hair cells, and for their maintenance at the mature synapse. How synaptic weights and innervation patterns might scale up or down or fluctuate in distribution within the hair cell–afferent complexes need to be examined in our model. (d) A neural feedback circuit. It is remarkable that vertebrates exert an efferent (EVS) neural control over the sensitivity, bandwidth, and linearity of sound and motion sensation. In general, the EVS provides hair cell organs not only with the means to control passive filtering of sound and motion signals, but also to regulate the mechanical gain of the living amplifiers in the ear (Hudspeth, 2008; Rabbitt and Brownell, 2011). Efferent cell bodies are located in the caudal brainstem, a phylogenetically ancient structure that monitors and controls vital functions including alertness and arousal. A typical efferent neuron in toadfish has extensive dendritic arbors spanning the brainstem, thereby providing the neuron the capability to receive a wealth of descending command and ascending sensory information (Highstein and Baker, 1986; confirmed in the present study, q.v. Supplementary Figure 3). Spatial coding is likely not selective, since efferent fibers can innervate multiple end organs on one side or even bifurcate within the brain to innervate both labyrinths (Schwarz et al., 1981; Eden and Correia, 1982; Strutz, 1982; Dechesne et al., 1984; Highstein and Baker, 1986; Valli et al., 1986; Dickman and Correia, 1992; Fujino et al., 1993; Marco et al., 1993; Birinyi et al., 2001; Chi et al., 2007). Does the EVS participate in the adaptive processes observed after exposures to HG? We addressed this question indirectly in this study by (1) inferring EVS action on the hair cell by comparing Smax observed in each experimental group (Table 1), (2) inferring EVS action on the afferent by comparing average IR at Smax (IR, in ips/cycle) observed in each experimental group (Table 1), and (3) pairing the MIR (in ips) with and without EVS stimulation in absence of acceleration in the same afferent in each experimental group (Table 2). A more direct measure to determine EVS role in neural adaptation was sought, but not found. For example, axons presumed to originate from efferent neurons were too infrequently encountered and their discharge had no clear variants to permit a meaningful comparison among subjects within or across groups, and the EVS action on afferent sensitivity to acceleration stimuli via its influence on hair cell receptor potential could not be normalized in any meaningful manner, mostly due to the variability in EVS efficacy and frequency of occurrence within each fish. Efferent vestibular system functional role in nonmammalian vertebrates is likely linked to innate behaviors, such as attack and feeding and escape and aversives established for survival of the animal and its reproduction. In toadfish these actions are preceded by a stereotypic behavior, and it is powerfully evoked during the anticipatory phase of production of large, self-generated, and behaviorally relevant movements (Boyle and Highstein, 1984, 1990b; Highstein and Baker, 1985; Tricas and Highstein, 1990, 1991). EVS regulation of afferent sensitivity is likely through its action on hair cell modulation (Flock and Russell, 1976; Boyle et al., 2009; Rabbitt et al., 2010; Rohmann et al., 2015; Poppi et al., 2018). A novel finding supporting the importance of behavioral context in EVS function was recently reported by Chagnaud et al. (2015). In a semi-isolated preparation, which permits identifying the source of incoming signals, of larval Xenopus it was shown corollary discharge signals arising from the spinal central pattern generator cyclically modulated efferent neurons during fictive swimming. During these phasic epochs of efferent signaling, there was a corresponding gain reduction of afferent responses to vestibular-related stimuli. Thus, similar to toadfish, the EVS of Xenopus can effectively optimize sensory processing. No presumed efferent neurons were encountered in the utricular nerve that consistently responded to applied otolith (linear acceleration or body roll/pitch) or canal (yaw rotation or head down/up pitch) stimuli. Given their low discharge at rest and disregard to benign vestibular stimulation, as well as the powerful excitation during preparatory behaviors, efferent neurons likely provide more episodic control over their synaptic targets and not a tonic influence. Recent evidence showed that the EVS could influence VOR plasticity using the α9 knockout mouse model, particularly after destruction of one labyrinth (Hübner et al., 2017). Although in a classical sense the EVS might still provide an underlying tonic drive to its targets, for the sake of argument in the present context a drive that also monitors the prevailing gravity condition, it does not provide cross-talk between otoliths and canals for continuous passive stimuli or influence the output during benign and nonthreatening volitional movements. Viewed from this perspective the EVS endows the toadfish with a powerful means to adjust the sensitivity and dynamic range of motion sensation, and is positioned to monitor prevailing conditions and regulate the gravity sensation (Kondrachuk and Boyle, 2006). However, no direct measurements or indirect inferences from afferent discharge behavior were found here to suggest a clear EVS role in regulating the utricular response to altered gravity. The information content provided by the efferent feedback signal in diverse conditions may be more complex and involve a novel self-regulation of synapses induced by changes in input signals in altered gravity.Author Contributions All authors had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

    "conclusion": "Conclusions and perspectives A useful guide for the biologist’s view of the cell has been that structure reflects function. This perspective has been powerfully applied to the study of membrane traffic with an understanding that the molecular basis for observed membrane structures and dynamics is tightly coupled with function. In this Review, we focus on individual stages in membrane transport that influence organization of the ER–Golgi interface. Through a comparative analysis of model systems, we begin to see how this core structural machinery is adapted to meet cell-specific requirements. However, future studies will need to further integrate cellular regulatory networks that control biosynthetic rates and flux through trafficking routes with this core machinery. For example, changing developmental and environmental conditions that alter the profile of protein and lipid cargos must be integrated in a manner that maintains the organization of the ER–Golgi interface. Global regulation through the UPR clearly has a key homeostatic role in coordinating protein and lipid biosynthetic rates in response to environmental conditions. But studying how the UPR orchestrates such adaptation may be challenging because there are multiple branches of the UPR in animal and plant cells53,111, and these are likely to work in concert with several other signalling networks that regulate membrane traffic. Advancing such ‘systems-level’ questions will depend on the identification of all required factors, in vivo microscopy and cell-free assays to accurately measure cargo biosynthetic and transport rates, as well as the elucidation of the sensor networks that are in place for overall coordination of distinct trafficking steps. Continued comparative analyses across a range of model organisms should ultimately allow us to further define the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of ER–Golgi transport in the context of cellular function.",

While these core coat machineries and other transport factors are highly conserved across species, high-resolution imaging studies indicate that the organization of the ER–Golgi interface is varied in eukaryotic cells. Regulation of COPII assembly, in some cases to manage distinct cellular cargo, is emerging as one important component in determining this structure. Comparison of the ER–Golgi interface across different systems, particularly mammalian and plant cells, reveals fundamental elements and distinct organization of this interface. A better understanding of how these interfaces are regulated to meet varying cellular secretory demands should provide key insights into the mechanisms that control efficient trafficking of proteins and lipids through the secretory pathway. The secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells is responsible for biogenesis and proper intracellular distribution of a wide range of proteins, complex carbohydrates and lipids. Trafficking in the secretory pathway is highly dynamic and responsive to specific cellular functional demands. Forward transport (also known as anterograde transport) of newly synthesized proteins and lipids is initiated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, as such, ER-to-Golgi transport represents a vital gateway to the endomembrane system. Membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi is bidirectional and occurs via similar mechanisms. In both cases, a carrier forms on the donor organelle and then tethers to and fuses with the target organelle (FIG. 1). Distinct machineries facilitate the formation of carriers for anterograde and retrograde transport, which are thought to ensure fidelity and directionality of trafficking: coat protein complex II (COPII) operates in the anterograde pathway from the ER, and COPI functions in the retrograde route from the Golgi. Although in vitro studies suggest that the formation of COPI- and COPII-coated carriers is mechanistically similar and can occur via the action of minimal components (including heteromeric coat complexes, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and SAR1 (secretion-associated RAS-related 1) GTPases and their regulatory guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (BOX 1; BOX 2), other elements are necessary to coordinate the two trafficking routes in vivo and thereby maintain organelle structure and function. This is supported by evidence demonstrating that chemical disruption of the COPI route with the ARF GEF inhibitor brefeldin A leads to the collapse of ER export1,2, which may be due to depletion of proteins required for the formation of COPII carriers that occurs because Golgi-to-ER retrieval is blocked. Similarly, dominantnegative versions of SAR1 that block COPII assembly rapidly disrupt Golgi structure and function1. While the cellular functions of COPI and COPII as well as interdependence of the anterograde and retrograde trafficking routes are generally conserved across eukaryotes, the organization of the ER–Golgi interface varies greatly in different species. For example, plants and some yeast species have a compact organization of the ER and Golgi, whereas in animal cells the two organelles are separated by a pleomorphic intermediate compartment. The distribution of COPII budding sites on the ER, the nature of the transport vesicles themselves and the dependence on cytoskeletal components also vary. Furthermore, there seems to be enormous plasticity in the ER–Golgi interface, which can adapt to accommodate variations in COPII carrier size and number commensurate with cargo dimensions and quantity. Figure 1. Bidirectional transport between the ER and the Golgi is mediated by COPI and COPII carriers. Open in a new tab Bidirectional transport of secretory cargo between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi requires budding, movement, tethering, as well as uncoating and fusion of coat protein complex II (COPII) and COPI carriers with their respective compartments. These include bulk-flow cargo, membrane cargo and receptor-dependent luminal cargo. COPII carriers facilitate selective and bulk-flow cargo export towards the Golgi. One important function of COPI is to facilitate retrieval of escaped luminal proteins containing K/HDEL retrieval signals that are recognized by the K/HDEL receptor as well as other machinery required for optimal anterograde transport. Carrier fusion is mediated by vesicular SNARE proteins (v-SNAREs) and target-SNAREs (t-SNAREs) upon anchoring of the carriers to their target compartment via tethers.Box 1. The COPII coat complex and anterograde transport. The coat protein complex II (COPII) machinery consists of the SAR1 (secretion-associated RAS-related 1) GTPase and the two subcomplexes SEC23–SEC24 and SEC13–SEC31 (REF. 34) (see the figure, left panel). Activation of SAR1 is coordinated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-anchored guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SEC12 (top right panel), which produces the GTP-bound form of SAR1. Active SAR1 binds the ER membrane through an amino-terminal α-helix112. SAR1 recruits SEC23–SEC24 heterodimers through interaction with the SEC23 subunit113,114, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for SAR1 (REF. 113). Although diffusion or ‘bulk-flow’ of cargo into COPII carriers occurs115, it has been shown that COPII subunits can recognize specific ER export signals on membrane proteins for selective uptake116,117, and that SEC24 is the main COPII adaptor that recognizes specific sorting sequences in cargo118,119. The COPII coat is completed when SEC13–SEC31 heterodimers polymerize on the underlying SAR1–SEC23–SEC24–cargo complexes. SEC31 interacts directly with SAR1 and SEC23 (REF. 120), and polymerized SEC13–SEC31 subcomplexes provide a scaffold that imposes curvature to the nascent vesicle as it buds from the ER by membrane fission37,121. COPII vesicle biogenesis and uncoating of the transport carrier are regulated by SAR1 GTPase activity and recruitment of the outer coat layer120. ER-derived carriers retain coat subunits until they reach their target membrane, and coat phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are needed for vesicle fusion and budding, respectively102. COPII vesicle budding seems to be independent of dynamin-like GTPases, as purified COPII components are sufficient to generate vesicles (60–90 nm) from synthetic liposomes122,123. SEC12 and the components of the COPII coat are highly conserved with a larger number of paralogues in Arabidopsis thaliana compared with humans89. COPII paralogues display distinct functional complexity as exemplified by the specificity in recognition of cargo export signals among human SEC24 paralogues118, as well as in specific human diseases caused by mutations in the SAR1B, SEC23A and SEC24B isoforms124. Similarly, A. thaliana SEC24A, in contrast to A. thaliana SEC24B and SEC24C, is essential, and partial loss of function of SEC24A causes unique ER morphology defects94.Box 2. The COPI coat complex and retrograde transport. The coat protein complex I (COPI) consists of a heptameric (α, β, β′, γ, δ, ε, ζ) complex, also called coatomer125, with two main subcomplexes: the γ-COP–δ-COP–ζ-COP–β-COP tetrameric complex, which constitutes the inner layer core; and the α-COP–β′-COP–ε-COP trimeric complex, which forms the outer layer of the COPI coat126 (see the figure, left panel). Once activated by ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) containing a conserved SEC7 domain, myristoylated membrane-anchored ARF GTPases recruit COPI to Golgi membranes (right panel). The coatomer subunits α-COP, β′-COP, γ-COP and δ-COP recognize sorting motifs on the cytosolic domain of membrane cargo and mediate cargo incorporation into nascent COPI vesicles127. ARF GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) bind cytoplasmic signals on cargo proteins, γ-COP and β′-COP subunits as well as active ARFs (not shown). Stimulation of the GTPase activity of ARFs by ARF GAPs leads to the release of ARF from the complex and ARF GAP and coat dissociation127,128 (not shown). At the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi interface, COPI facilitates retrograde transport from the Golgi and ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). A retrograde Golgi–ER pathway has also been suggested to recycle lipids129 and ER resident proteins130. However, its occurrence in vivo was demonstrated through experiments using brefeldin A (BFA) in which the addition of the drug allowed Golgi-specific oligosaccharide modification of ER-retained vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein131. The results were interpreted as a consequence of a redistribution of resident Golgi proteins to the ER. In accordance with this hypothesis, reversible BFA-induced disruption of the Golgi has been observed in microscopy studies132,133. It is now established that primary targets of BFA are ARF GEFs, such as GBF1 in mammalian cells134,135. BFA stabilizes the interaction of inactive ARFs with their GEFs136 as well as ARF GEF binding to Golgi membranes134, which in turn inactivates ARF. These results underscore that the integrity of the anterograde traffic route depends tightly on the homeostasis of the retrograde pathway, which ensures not only the retrieval of resident proteins that escape the ER but also facilitates the recycling of lipids and trafficking machinery necessary for ER export and carrier fusion to the Golgi. Therefore, inhibition of the retrograde trafficking route leads to the collapse of anterograde trafficking.In this Review, we discuss how the ER–Golgi interface and COPII-mediated trafficking varies in different species. We focus on the plant and mammalian systems as exquisite examples of how divergent adaptation of common components of the trafficking system has allowed the unique needs of differentiated eukaryotic cell types to be met. Ultimately, a more complete understanding of these observed morphologies in molecular terms should provide crucial insights into regulatory mechanisms that control protein and lipid trafficking in the early secretory pathway. The ER and Golgi: partners in secretion The ER is responsible for initiating the synthesis, folding and quality control, as well as priming the glycosylation, of a large part of the cellular proteome. It has a unique architecture that is characterized by a network of interconnected membrane tubules and sheets that form closed polygons. Most proteins that have been synthesized in the ER are transported to the Golgi during their biogenesis. The Golgi has several fundamental cellular roles. First, it functions as a central platform for connecting anterograde and retrograde protein flow within the secretory pathway3. Second, it serves as a complex carbohydrate ‘factory’ that supplies the material needed to build the plant cell wall and the glycoprotein matrix surrounding animal cells, as well as the donor groups for glycosylation of many proteins and lipids4–10. Last, the Golgi also provides a membrane scaffold for the dynamic binding of various signalling and sorting proteins11,12. In most eukaryotes, the membranes of the Golgi assume a characteristic stacked morphology with cisternae that differ in enzymatic content and activity13,14. This highly polarized organization defines cis-, medial- and transcisternae, with the cis-most cisternae facing the ER15. The trans-most cisternae face the trans-Golgi network (TGN), a tubular vesicular cluster that executes final sorting steps to post-Golgi destinations, exchanges material with the endocytic pathway and can, at least in plants, exist as an independent organelle from the Golgi16,17.Basic elements of the ER–Golgi interface With a few notable exceptions, including cytoplasmic, nuclear and signal peptide-containing proteins18, secreted proteins follow a conventional ER–Golgi secretory route. To exit the ER, fully folded soluble and membrane cargos are packaged into COPII-coated carriers at specialized, long-lived subdomains of the ER, termed ER exit sites (ERES)19,20. Although the number, size and dynamics of ERES vary across cell types and species, most eukaryotic cells examined so far display these organized export zones on ER membranes. ERES are enriched in COPII and appear as discrete puncta during fluorescence imaging of COPII coat proteins21–24. In addition to the core COPII components, large multidomain SEC16 proteins localize to ERES and are required for export site assembly and function25,26. Indeed, current models suggest that SEC16 establishes an ERES scaffold that recruits COPII to export zones through multiple interactions with coat subunits27. In all cell types studied, the COPII machinery seems to conduct at least two critical functions: first, the inner layer SAR1 and SEC23–SEC24 COPII subunits bind to and select specific cargo for packaging into ER-derived transport vesicles; second, polymerization of the outer layer SEC13–SEC31 COPII complex into a cage structure deforms ER membranes to drive transport vesicle formation (BOX 1). ER-derived transport intermediates fuse with acceptor membranes through a series of targeting and fusion events that also rely on a highly conserved machinery28. In general, membrane targeting depends on RAB GTPases that function in concert with extended coiled-coil domain proteins, such as p115 (known as Uso1 in yeast), as well as the multisubunit TRAPPI (transport protein particle I) complex29–31. Targeted COPII vesicles proceed to fusion through regulated assembly of ternary SNARE complexes between donor vesicle and acceptor membrane compartments (BOX 3). In the return Golgi-to-ER route, COPI subunits recognize retrograde sorting signals in recycled cargos, and this mediates the incorporation of selected cargos into COPI-coated transport intermediates (BOX 2). Targeting of COPI vesicles to the ER requires the multisubunit DSL1 tethering complex to direct SNARE-mediated membrane fusion of COPI vesicles with ER membranes32. Box 3. Tethering and SNARE-mediated fusion of COPII vesicles. The directionality and fidelity of coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicle fusion is mediated by concerted action of RAB GTPases, tethering factors and integral membrane SNARE proteins. In mammalian cells, the vesicle targeting stage depends on RAB1 (REF. 30) and the extended coiled-coil domain tethering factors p115, GM130 (cis-Golgi matrix of 130 kDa) and GRASP65 (Golgi reassembly-stacking protein of 65 kDa)137,138 as well as the 170 kDa multisubunit TRAPPI (transport protein particle I) tethering complex (comprising BET3 (blocked early in transport 3), BET5, TRS20 (TRAPP subunit 20 (also known as Sedlin), TRS23, TRS31 and TRS33) that exerts guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity towards RAB1 (REFS 139,140). RAB1·GTP recruits p115 and tethers vesicles to acceptor membranes. Therefore, the activation of RAB1 on acceptor membranes by TRAPPI may generate a localized signal to tether COPII vesicles. The BET3 subunit of TRAPPI also binds directly to the SEC23 subunit of COPII and can tether COPII vesicles at a close distance31. Fusion of COPII-tethered vesicles depends on a set of four tail-anchored integral membrane SNARE proteins named syntaxin 5, membrin (also known as GOSR2), BET1 and SEC22B141–143. SNARE proteins contain a conserved membrane-proximal heptad repeat sequence known as the SNARE motif, and trans-assembly of cognate sets of SNARE proteins from donor and acceptor membranes into four-helix bundles drives bilayer fusion144,145. Therefore, trans-assembly of syntaxin 5, membrin, BET1 and SEC22B between tethered COPII vesicles and Golgi acceptor membranes catalyses fusion. The conserved syntaxin 5-binding protein SLY1 is also required for this vesicle fusion step146 and may serve to coordinate the vesicle tethering and fusion stages. Regulation at these multiple stages in COPII vesicle tethering and fusion may have crucial roles in determining ER–Golgi morphology and levels of coated transport intermediates, but is relatively unexplored.Mechanisms of interface control While most cell types examined use these basic conserved ER–Golgi trafficking components, studies are revealing additional layers of control that influence the morphology of the ER–Golgi interface and transport carriers. In some cases, the COPII export machinery seems to have adapted to manage diverse secretory cargos. For example, certain mammalian cell types must export large secretory cargos from the ER such as 300–400 nm procollagen fibres33 or 100–500 nm lipoprotein particles, which are larger than the reported size of a standard 60–90 nm COPII-coated vesicle19,34. Several lines of evidence indicate that the COPII cage is flexible35,36, and this would allow the formation of larger COPII-coated intermediates and thereby the transport of large cargo. A combination of structural approaches has revealed that SEC13–SEC31 subunits can self-assemble into polyhedral cages of distinct orders through moderate variation in geometries of subunit interactions37–39 (FIG. 2). Such flexibility in the COPII cage has also been observed in cells40 and in reconstitution studies using COPII proteins and giant unilamellar vesicles41. These studies show that the COPII coat can form extended tubular structures and constricted tubules resembling ‘beads on a string’ that are of sufficient dimensions to accommodate procollagen fibres. Figure 2. The architecture of the COPII cage facilitates transport of diverse cargo. Open in a new tab Structural analyses have demonstrated that the coat protein complex II (COPII) cage, which consists of the SEC13–SEC31 and SEC23–SEC24 subcomplexes, has a flexible architecture. a | Electron microscope reconstruction model of the SEC13–SEC31 cuboctahedral cage that is formed with purified mammalian SEC13–SEC31 (REF. 37) (Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDataBank) accession number: EMDB1232). b | Schematic representation of SEC31–SEC13 (shown in green and blue, respectively) heterotetramers arranged at a vertex point, indicating variable angles in the observed geometry of COPII cages. c | The structures for the SEC13–SEC31 assembly unit38 and the SEC13–SEC31 cage37 in the presence of SEC23 (REF. 147) and SEC23–SEC24 (REF. 35) have been reported. Variations in the SEC31 hinge (135°–165°) as well as in the β-vertex angle (90°–108°) of the SEC13–SEC31 cage have been documented and are listed in the table. The α-vertex angle is constant at 60° in each of the conditions. Under conditions in which SEC23–SEC24 is added to SEC13–SEC31, cuboctahedral (a 24 edged polygon) and icosidodecaheral (a 60 edged polygon) cage geometries were observed with each edge consisting of a SEC13–SEC31 heterotetramer. As the β-angle approaches 120° in the case of very large vesicles or tubules, the COPII cage may produce near-planar lattices35. Distinct arrangements in the COPII cage are thought to allow for the range of COPII vesicle carriers necessary to accommodate varying cargo sizes.Consistent with the idea that transport carriers can adapt to accommodate particular cargo, genetic studies have revealed that isoform-specific mutations in SEC23A cause developmental defects due to deficiencies in collagen secretion, whereas smaller secretory cargos undergo normal trafficking42–44. Similarly, human chylomicron retention disease has been linked to mutations in the SAR1B isoform, which cause fat malabsorption due to deficiency in the secretion of large lipoproteins from enterocytes45,46. Interestingly, the interaction of SAR1 isoforms with distinct coat subunits and appropriate regulation of SAR1 GTPase activity seem to be crucial for the export of large procollagen and chylomicron cargos in COPII carriers. Recent studies have also revealed that monoubiquitylation of the SEC31 subunit is required for ER export of procollagen in developing mouse embryonic stem cells47. This post-translational modification could alter SEC31 structure and flexibility or recruit a cofactor that influences COPII assembly to generate large vesicles. Collectively, these findings support a model wherein distinct subunits of COPII can be assembled in different geometries and modulated by SAR1 GTPase activity to produce different sized transport carriers in various cell types. The composition, size and number of ERES also vary across cell types and are influenced by the cargo that is being secreted. Cells that export large procollagen from the ER depend on the transmembrane TANGO1–cTAGE5 (transport and Golgi organization protein 1–cutaneous T cell lymphoma-associated antigen 5) complex that localizes to ERES and has a crucial role in ER export of selected cargo48,49. The TANGO1–cTAGE5 complex interacts with SEC23–SEC24, but is not itself packaged into COPII carriers. Instead, it is thought to coordinate procollagen capture into large vesicles at ERES through binding to lumenal procollagen and regulation of cytoplasmic SEC23–SEC24 (REF. 49). Interestingly, orthologues of TANGO1 and cTAGE5 have only been identified in vertebrates, suggesting that this complex has evolved to manage large cargo in specialized cell types. Indeed, in plant cells, large cellulose fibrils are polymerized directly at the plasma membrane rather than being assembled before their secretion50. In addition to the effects of cargo dimension on ERES composition, secretory cargo load influences ERES size and number. For example, in plant cells the number of ERES and the recruitment of SEC24 to ERES increases in cells transiently expressing ER export-competent membrane cargo. However, this occurs only if the cargo contained an ER export motif51. In mammalian cells, acute increases in cargo load cause ERES to fuse, producing larger but fewer exit sites. Conversely, a chronic rise in secretory cargo increases both the size and number of ERES52 as well as the expression of SEC24 and SEC16 in part through the activation of an ER stress-sensing unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway53. These findings demonstrate that cargo type, size and volume influence ERES structure and abundance, and that the cargo can influence the organization of the ER–Golgi interface. More generally, the UPR is likely to have a prominent role in controlling ER–Golgi membrane structure and function during the development of many cell types. After secretory cargos have exited the ER in COPII carriers, these intermediates fuse with target membranes using a conserved core machinery. However, the distances that these ER-derived carriers travel and the requirement for cytoskeletal filaments differ depending on the cell type. The target membrane for COPII carriers also varies in addition to the set of tethering factors that are engaged. For example, animal cells rely on microtubules to guide COPII vesicles towards an ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) en route to cis-Golgi compartments54. Indeed, multiple types of microtubule-based motors localize to this intermediate compartment and are thought to generate the pleomorphic membrane structures that are characteristic of the ERGIC55. By contrast, in other species, including yeast that have a more compact ER–Golgi organization, COPII vesicles seem to fuse directly to cis-Golgi compartments56. In the following sections, we examine more closely the organization of the ER–Golgi interface across species with a focus on plant and mammalian systems as two well-studied examples of how the ER–Golgi interface has been adapted to meet cellular needs. Specifically, we compare current models for COPII carrier-mediated trafficking from the ER in mammalian cells (in which the ER and Golgi compartments are separated and depend on an intermediate compartment for efficient transport) with trafficking in plant cells (in which Golgi stacks are closely associated with the ER and are highly mobile).Variations in the ER–Golgi interface Models comparing the ER–Golgi interface in mammalian and plant cells are shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4. In cultured mammalian cells, the Golgi stacks are clustered and connected by inter-cisternal tubules to form a Golgi ribbon57. This configuration is fundamentally different from plants, in which the Golgi is composed of individual stacks of flattened cisternae58,59, termed Golgi bodies or stacks. This morphology is seen in the insect Drosophila melanogaster 60 and the yeast Pichia pastoris22 as well as in the unicellular parasites Trypanosoma brucei61 and Toxoplasma gondii62. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae may represent an extreme example, in which cis-, medial- and trans-Golgi cisternae seem to be completely unstacked22. Notably, the plant Golgi is distinct from these other species in that it shows rapid motility (up to 4 μm per sec)58, and this requires the activity of actomyosin motors59,63–65 and close association with tubular ER strands. This latter feature is underscored by the absence in plants of the ERGIC, which is found in mammalian cells66–69. Figure 3. The ER–Golgi interface and ERES have a distinct organization in mammals and plants. Open in a new tab a | In mammalian cells, ER exit sites (ERES) are orientated towards a juxtaposed endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles originate within cup-shaped ER subdomains, which are associated with the plus end of microtubules. Upon fission of vesicles from the ERES, the SEC13–SEC31 cage is depolymerized, but the SEC23–SEC24 coat is partially retained. Vesicles reach the ERGIC in a microtubule-independent manner where they are tethered through the interaction between SEC23 and the TRAPPI (transport protein particle I) tethering complex. COPI mediates forward protein transport from the ERGIC towards the Golgi as well as recycling back to the ER membrane (the latter is not shown). b | In plant cells, ERES and Golgi are closely associated, possibly through a matrix (indicated in grey) that holds the ER and the Golgi together. The existence of COPII vesicles in plants is still debated (denoted by the question mark); vesicle-like structures have been seen89,97,99,106 rarely in electron microscopy analyses of high-pressure frozen Arabidopsis thaliana tissues, although it was unclear whether they were undergoing budding or fusion. Unlike mammalian cells, plant cell ER–Golgi transport does not rely on the microtubule cytoskeleton.Figure 4.

Renna, Michigan State University, USA.The ERGIC as a distinct intermediate organelle Implicit in the ER–Golgi organization of eukaryotic species are different strategies to efficiently transport cargo from the ER to the Golgi. In S. cerevisiae and in plant cells, ER–Golgi transport fits a simple model whereby COPII carriers shuttle cargo from the ER to the Golgi by fusing directly with the cis-Golgi70 or by generating new cisternae by homotypic fusion. In mammalian cells, the situation is more complex as the distances between ERES and the cis-Golgi compartment are longer than in yeast and plant cells. Indeed, the ERGIC may be necessary to facilitate this long-distance transport in mammalian cells. Previous models described the ERGIC as a specialized domain of the ER71 or the cis-Golgi72, although it may be more appropriate to consider the ERGIC as a distinct organelle73,74 that functions in COPI-dependent sorting of retrograde cargo, in concentration of anterograde biosynthetic cargo75 and possibly in post-ER protein quality control76. Early live-cell imaging analyses suggested that ERGIC structures may move from ERES to the Golgi by tracking on microtubules54,77. These results seeded the transport complex model19,78 whereby newly uncoated COPII vesicles would fuse to form transient pleiomorphic vesicular tubular clusters, which would then be transported to the Golgi via long-range microtubule tracks and dynein motors. The tubular clusters would either homotypically fuse to form new cis-Golgi cisternae, or they would fuse with the first cisternae of the cis-Golgi. COPI-coated vesicles formed from tubular clusters and cis-Golgi membranes would then recycle components back to the ER (FIG. 3a). An alternative model for ER–Golgi protein transport in mammalian cells, termed the stable compartment model, views the ERGIC as a more static structure. This model proposes that positioning of the ERGIC between ERES and the Golgi facilitates a two-step transport process, which involves short-range microtubule-independent transport of COPII vesicles from ERES to the ERGIC followed by long-range microtubule-dependent transport of anterograde cargo-rich domains from the ERGIC to the cis-Golgi. Microtubule-associated proteins such as the microtubule plus enddirected motor kinesin and the minus end-directed motor dynein have been found in association with the ERGIC. Moreover, functional analyses indicate that kinesin operates in recycling of membranes to the ER, whereas dynein is needed for anterograde transport54,79,80. In the stable compartment model, kinesin and dynein would mediate steady-state positioning of the ERGIC but also have an active role in transport: kinesin would facilitate microtubule plus end-directed retrograde trafficking to the ER and dynein–dynactin would facilitate the transport from the ERGIC to the cis-Golgi74. Elements of the actin cytoskeleton such as actin-binding proteins (spectrin)11,81 and regulatory GTPases (CDC42)82 have also been invoked as dynactin-recruiting factors during this process. Currently, it is not clear whether the stable compartment or the transport complex model better explain ERGIC function in trafficking. Imaging studies have shown that small soluble cargo is sorted into Golgi-directed carriers from long-lived ERGIC structures83, although the machinery responsible for this event has not been defined. It is also possible that both mechanisms operate to transport cargos of varying size that move through the ERGIC. For example, smaller cargo molecules could move through more mobile transport carriers, whereas larger cargo present in mammalian cells may be trafficked in ERGIC transport complexes. Dual-label imaging experiments that simultaneously monitor ERGIC markers and a broad range of secretory cargo may help resolve this issue. COPII carrier dynamics in plant cells Analyses in plant cells indicating that ER export can occur while Golgi stacks are moving in close association with ER tubules84 raise a fundamental question of how proteins and membranes are efficiently transported from the ER to mobile Golgi stacks (FIG. 3b). One model has postulated that an active ERES produces a localized signal that uncouples a Golgi stack from actin-associated motors and causes it to pause near this site. Completion of membrane and cargo transfer to and from the ER would be followed by inactivation of this ‘pausing’ cue, allowing the Golgi stack to resume its movement58. This model assumes that the association of ERES with Golgi stacks is not continuous and that COPII foci may be dispersed over the ER, awaiting interaction with a suitable Golgi stack. However, analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana SEC13 expressed in A. thaliana and in tobacco leaf epidermal cells as well as in BY2 cells showed that SEC13 is present in foci that have continuous association with Golgi stacks85 rather than being dispersed over the ER. A continuous association of foci with Golgi stacks has also been validated in several reports in which other COPII proteins were labelled, including SAR1, SEC23 and SEC24, and that investigated both heterologous as well as endogenous plant expression systems51,85–95 (FIG. 4f). Together, this supports the model that ERES are in continuous association with Golgi stacks24,96. The presence of COPII vesicles in plants is still debated. Vesicle-like structures have been rarely detected89,97–99 in electron microscopy analyses of high-pressure frozen A. thaliana tissues; moreover, the directionality of such structures (that is, whether these are budding or fusing intermediates) could not be established. Nonetheless, in studies of high-pressure freeze-substituted A. thaliana root tip cells, immunogold labelling analyses with antibodies specific for A. thaliana SAR1 and SEC23 showed labelling of some vesicle-like structures67,99. The difficulty to visualize budding COPII vesicles in plants raises the possibility that these entities may be very quickly consumed at the ER surface. Through optical manipulation of individual Golgi stacks with laser tweezers100 in highly vacuolated cells, it has been shown that lateral displacement of individual Golgi stacks is followed by continued link-age and rapid growth of the attached ER tubule. This finding indicates that in these plant cells the Golgi and ER are firmly attached, possibly through a tethering matrix at the Golgi–ER interface that physically links the two organelles together84. The association of ERES with individual Golgi stacks in plant cells is conceptually feasible in the context of a matrix-mediated attachment of the ER with Golgi stacks. For example, ERES could facilitate export to a Golgi stack at an ER–Golgi interface that is relatively static. Such an organization would be more energy efficient than a system that stochastically produces ERES. This may be analogous to Caenorhabditis elegans in which ERES are closely juxtaposed to the Golgi and proteins such as the SEC-16-interacting protein TFG-1 direct movement of COPII carriers away from the ER101. It is also possible that in addition to ERES-associated Golgi, new ERES may be formed on the ER to initiate de novo assembly of Golgi stacks. Fluorescent protein localization analysis has shown that the YFP–SEC24 fusion protein is enriched at the Golgi surface97, and this was proposed to represent the accumulation of COPII carriers before fusion97. This possibility is consistent with findings in yeast and mammalian cells showing that COPII may be partially retained on ER-derived carriers until they reach the Golgi102. As mentioned above, putative COPII vesicles have been detected in close association with cis-cisternal Golgi elements in electron microscopy analyses of A. thaliana cells, and the formation of these initial cis-cisterna may be functionally analogous to the mammalian ERGIC67. Disassembly of COPII coats is initiated when SAR1 hydrolyses its bound GTP (BOX 1), although coat subunits seem to be slowly released after carrier formation. It has also been shown that fluorescent protein fusions of two plant SAR1 isoforms distribute along the ER facing the Golgi87. Together, these findings suggest that ER export in plant cells relies on a unique organization in which a specialized subdomain of the ER and an associated Golgi stack act as a secretory unit with COPII carriers being formed and quickly released at the ER subdomain and partially coated COPII carriers then associating with the Golgi. Additional validation of this model could be achieved by analysing the subcellular distribution of SEC16, which would be predicted to associate with the ER-facing Golgi stacks. A scenario in which COPII vesicles form and are transported from the ER at a rate that is faster than COPII uncoating at the Golgi is consistent with the observation that fluorescently tagged versions of COPII components can be readily visualized in live plant cells, although COPII vesicles have rarely been seen at an ultrastructural level in plants103–106. In contrast to mammalian cells, plant ER–Golgi transport does not depend on cytoskeletal components. In highly vacuolated plant cells, the Golgi undergoes actomyosin-dependent movement, but chemical inhibition of this movement does not disrupt the transport between the ER and Golgi. This has been demonstrated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), in which markers were tracked in immobilized Golgi after treating cells with actin-disrupting chemicals2. Microtubules also do not seem to be involved in ER–Golgi protein transport in plants; for example, rates of ER–Golgi protein traffic are similar in cells with depolymerized actin and in cells depleted of both actin and microtubules2. Fluorescence recovery of cycling proteins has also been observed upon photobleaching of Golgi in untreated cells24, again supporting the model that ER export can occur toward motile Golgi. However, it has not yet been established whether there are differences in ER–Golgi transport kinetics between cells with disrupted versus intact actin, or between fast or slow moving Golgi stacks.Different forms for unique functions A conserved core machinery transports biosynthetic cargo forward in the early secretory pathway and is balanced with retrieval routes that maintain the ER and Golgi compartments. In eukaryotic cells, COPII assembly produces transport intermediates from the ER, which then rely on RAB GTPase-dependent tethering factors and the SNARE-dependent membrane fusion machinery for delivery of cargo to the Golgi. Similarly, retrograde transport depends on the COPI machinery to produce retrograde-directed vesicles that also require conserved tethering factors and SNARE proteins for fusion with ER membranes. In spite of this conservation, diversity in eukaryotic cell types and cellular functions generate tremendous variety in the organization of this ER–Golgi interface. Each trafficking step between ER and Golgi compartments provides multiple opportunities for regulation that could influence vesicle and organelle size and shape. Indeed, there are now clear examples in which the expression levels of these core components and their covalent modification (for example, phosphorylation or ubiquitylation) alter the morphology of COPII carriers. Moreover, the additional control provided by accessory factors such as TANGO1 and cTAGE5 and cytoskeletal components in certain cell types also affects ER–Golgi organization. Finally, inherent flexibility in both the COPII35 and COPI107 coats that allows cargos of different sizes to be accommodated can influence the morphology of ER–Golgi transport intermediates in different cell types. The influence of cargo The striking differences in the organization of ER–Golgi interfaces across species that are revealed by in vivo morphological analyses probably reflect cellular specialization related to the types of cargo that must be transported as well as the overall cell structure and function. If we consider the possibility that distinct morphologies observed reflect functional adaptation of the core transport machinery, a molecular understanding of these differences should provide important insights into how trafficking and compartmental organization are integrated within the early secretory pathway. For example, the existence of an ERGIC in certain cell types and not in others remains mysterious. As discussed above, P. pastoris yeast cells56 and vacuolated plant cells106 lack an ERGIC but instead contain compact ER–Golgi units (≤300 nm distance between the two organelles) that are thought to be firmly connected through a tethering matrix. However, such a compact arrangement may not provide the space that would be needed for the assembly of large cargo into dissociating transport carriers without generating membrane connections between the ER and Golgi compartments. Indeed, there are no known large secretory cargos (≥300nm) in P. pastoris or A. thaliana. By contrast, active secretory cells in vertebrates generally contain an ERGIC, and these cell types often transport large cargo molecules such as procollagen.Cellular architecture as a driving force for interface organization Although the cargo that is being transported may be one driver of ER–Golgi organization, an alternative structural demand for the ERGIC in vertebrate cells may be to bridge the large distance between the perinuclear ER and the plasma membrane. In this context, the ERGIC and a microtubule network may be needed to facilitate efficient transport and limit diffusion of intermediates. By contrast, the plant ER and Golgi are ‘sandwiched’ within a thin layer of cytoplasm between the tonoplast and the plasma membrane due to the presence of a central vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume (FIG. 4d). Cytoskeletal elements may therefore not be needed to facilitate bidirectional ER–Golgi traffic or to restrict diffusion of transport intermediates. Finally, a more extensive set of ER–Golgi tethering factors is present in cells that contain an ERGIC. In plants, there are no apparent homologues of mammalian GRASP65 (Golgi reassembly-stacking protein of 65 kDa), GM130 (cis-Golgi matrix of 130 kDa) and giantin vesicle tethering factors108. However, plants do require a p115 homologue for ER–Golgi transport and express other Golgi-localized coiled-coil domain proteins with sequence identify to tethering factors109. Although the function of these proteins has yet to be determined, this simplified set of tethering factors may underlie matrix-mediated attachment of ER–Golgi units in plants. Nevertheless, questions regarding how the ERGIC is generated and maintained in mammalian cells remain unanswered. Interestingly, loss of GM130 leads to the disruption of the mammalian Golgi ribbon110. The absence of GM130 homologues in plants may suggest that the acquisition or loss of specialized tethering factors may have been a contributing factor for the unique organization of the plant Golgi during evolution from the last common eukaryotic ancestor. Notably, variations in the ER–Golgi interface can also exist within the same species. For example, most characterizations of ERES in plant cells have been acquired in highly vacuolated cells. In specialized tissues such as root meristem cells and columella cells that are comparatively less vacuolated, a large percentage of Golgi stacks (≤70%) have been reported to not closely associate with the ER106. How ER export occurs towards Golgi stacks in these cells is unknown. Although most cells are highly vacuolated in plants, these findings underscore that the organization of the ER and Golgi can vary and suggest that specific ER export mechanisms are in place to suit the organization of specific cell types, even within the same organism.Conclusions and perspectives A useful guide for the biologist’s view of the cell has been that structure reflects function. This perspective has been powerfully applied to the study of membrane traffic with an understanding that the molecular basis for observed membrane structures and dynamics is tightly coupled with function. In this Review, we focus on individual stages in membrane transport that influence organization of the ER–Golgi interface. Through a comparative analysis of model systems, we begin to see how this core structural machinery is adapted to meet cell-specific requirements. However, future studies will need to further integrate cellular regulatory networks that control biosynthetic rates and flux through trafficking routes with this core machinery. For example, changing developmental and environmental conditions that alter the profile of protein and lipid cargos must be integrated in a manner that maintains the organization of the ER–Golgi interface. Global regulation through the UPR clearly has a key homeostatic role in coordinating protein and lipid biosynthetic rates in response to environmental conditions. But studying how the UPR orchestrates such adaptation may be challenging because there are multiple branches of the UPR in animal and plant cells53,111, and these are likely to work in concert with several other signalling networks that regulate membrane traffic. Advancing such ‘systems-level’ questions will depend on the identification of all required factors, in vivo microscopy and cell-free assays to accurately measure cargo biosynthetic and transport rates, as well as the elucidation of the sensor networks that are in place for overall coordination of distinct trafficking steps. Continued comparative analyses across a range of model organisms should ultimately allow us to further define the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of ER–Golgi transport in the context of cellular function.Acknowledgments F.B is supported by grants from the US National Institutes of Health (R01 GM101038), Chemical Sciences, Geosciences and Biosciences Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science, U.S. DOE (DE-FG02-91ER20021), NASA (NNX12AN71G) and the National Science Foundation (MCB 0948584; 1243792).

IRE1 is an ER transmembrane sensor that activates UPR to maintain ER and cellular function. While mammalian IRE1 promotes cell survive, it can initiate apoptosis via decay of anti-apoptotic microRNAs. Convergent and divergent IRE1 characteristics between plants and animals underscore its significance in cellular homeostasis. This review provides an updated scenario of IRE1 signaling model, discusses emerging IRE1 sensing mechanisms, compares IRE1 features among species, and outlines exciting future directions in UPR research. Keywords: unfolded protein response, ER stress, IRE1, cell fate, protein quality control, membrane trafficking systemER stress and unfolded protein response The membrane trafficking system maintains operation of approximately one-third of the eukaryotic proteome. Most secretory proteins first enter the ER for folding and assembly. To maintain the fidelity of ER functions, cells coordinate a protein quality control system with a signaling network termed unfolded protein response (UPR) [1-6]. UPR is triggered by ER transmembrane sensors upon ER stress, a cellular condition referring to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER (Figure 1) [7, 8]. The adaptive response occurring at the initial phase of UPR aims to rebalance the protein-folding homeostasis [2, 3, 9-12]. If cells fail to recover from ER stress, UPR represses the adaptive response and triggers apoptosis [1, 3, 4, 7, 13, 14]. The inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1) is the only identified ER stress sensor in yeast and essential for UPR in animals and plants [15-18] (Figure 1). As an ER transmembrane protein, IRE1 monitors ER homeostasis through an ER luminal stress-sensing domain and triggers UPR through a cytoplasmic kinase domain and an RNase domain [15, 16]. Upon ER stress, IRE1 RNase is activated through conformational change, autophosphorylation, and higher order oligomerization [19-21]. Mammalian IRE1 initiates diverse downstream signaling of the UPR either through unconventional splicing of the transcription factor Xbp-1 or and through posttranscriptional modifications via Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay (RIDD) of multiple substrates [15, 16, 22-25]. In addition, PERK and ATF6 function as two distinct mammalian ER stress sensors to cope with complex UPR scenarios [7, 26] (Figure 1). Similar to IRE1, PERK and ATF6 are ER transmembrane proteins that contain an ER luminal stress-sensing domain and a cytoplasmic enzymatic domain. To prevent a further increase in protein-folding demand in the ER, PERK transiently inhibits general protein translation through phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (elF2α). Phosphorylated elF2α can also selectively activate translation of mRNAs including ATF4 transcription factor to regulate UPR target genes [27]. ER stress triggers relocation of ATF6 from the ER to the Golgi where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage. The cleaved transcription factor domain of ATF6 enters the nucleus for UPR regulation [28-30] (Figure 1). Figure 1. Overview of UPR arms in eukaryotes. Open in a new tab The IRE1 arm is conserved in eukaryotes. IRE1 unconventionally splices bZIP transcription factors, Xbp-1, bZIP60, and Hac1 mRNA in mammals, plants, and yeast respectively. The spliced bZIP transcription factor enters into the nucleus to regulate UPR target genes. In addition, two distinct arms mediated by PERK and ATF6 regulate mammalian UPR. ATF6 is an ER transmembrane transcription factor. ER stress triggers the relocation of ATF6 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus where it is undergone proteolytic cleavage. Subsequently, the transcription factor domain of ATF6 enters into the nucleus to modulate transcription of UPR target genes. Two functional homologues of ATF6, bZIP17 and bZIP28, exist in plants. PERK, an ER transmembrane protein kinase is identified only in animals. Upon ER stress, PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (elF2α), which leads to a transient inhibition of general protein translation and selective translation of the transcription factor ATF4. Under irremediable ER stress, PERK-elF2α-ATF4-CHOP and IRE1-JNK initiate apoptosis in mammals. Moreover, the beta subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein complex, AGB1, is essential for the plant UPR. Although the G protein complex is conserved in eukaryotes, its significance in UPR is unclear in other eukaryotic organisms. Color code: blue - eukaryotes; black - mammals; green - plants; red - yeast.The main molecular mechanisms underlying IRE1 unconventional splicing are conserved in eukaryotes. In budding yeast, mammals, and plants, there is only one transcription factor identified as a splicing target of IRE1 (Figure 1). The stem-loop structure and cleavage site of the IRE1 splicing substrate are conserved among species. In contrast, RIDD appears more divergent in eukaryotes. In yeast, RIDD is only operated in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, but not in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [31]. Intriguingly, RIDD-mediated decrease in protein-folding demand is the only identified mechanism of UPR in fission yeast [31]. While plant RIDD may potentially degrade a significant portion of mRNAs encoding secretory proteins [32], it is undetermined whether plant RIDD processes various substrates to direct UPR outputs like mammalian RIDD. Unlike mammalian UPR, plant PERK orthologs have not been yet identified; however, two functional homologs of ATF6, bZIP28 and bZIP17, exist in plants [33] (Figure 1). Moreover, a component of G-protein complex, AGB1, is essential for plant UPR [17] while an alternative G-protein-coupled receptor is involved in noncanonical UPR in C.elegans [34]. Due to large members of the mammalian G-protein complex, its roles in classical UPR might be more challenging to reveal. While IRE1 and ATF6 arms are partially conserved between plants and animals, it is interesting to establish the degree of UPR diversification between the two species. This review presents the latest advances and viewpoints on IRE1-dependent UPR research. We focus on the recent groundbreaking discoveries that define IRE1 as a master regulator in cell fate determination under ER stress. IRE1 was long considered as a positive regulator in cell survival. Thus, the repression of IRE1 was believed to potentiate apoptosis. The recent identification of novel IRE1 regulatory events reveals that IRE1 signaling is persistent during ER stress. Namely, IRE1 can no longer be considered simply as a driving force for cell survival, but rather as an administrator/executor of cell fate determination under ER stress. Through presentation of the recent evidence establishing that IRE1 triggers diverse signaling, we delineate current IRE1-signaling models. It has also become clear that IRE1 monitors cellular homeostasis beyond the protein-folding status in the ER; therefore, the functional relevance of the UPR within physiological processes will be discussed. Finally, we will compare convergent and divergent features of IRE1 between plants and mammals to provide an integrated view of IRE1 in multicellular eukaryotes.IRE1 signaling in cell fate determination Life-versus-death determination is constantly scrutinized and tightly controlled. Prevalence of malfunctioning cells due to irremediable ER stress contributes to significant diseases, including cancer and diabetes. Conversely, over-commitment to cell death may result in organ damage or cell degenerative diseases [35-39]. To reach optimal fitness under ER stress, cell fates are determined through tight coordination of adaptive and apoptotic responses [37, 40, 41]. In mammals, PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 regulates the transcription factor CHOP to activate ER stress-triggered apoptosis. In parallel, IRE1 controls cell fate determination through mitogen protein kinase JNK under ER stress [3, 7, 8, 42] (Figure 1). In contrast, while ER stress can play a role in programmed cell death in plants [43], very little is known about ER stress-induced cell death in plants [17, 32, 44]. Furthermore, lack of sequence homologs of most mammalian apoptosis regulators in plants hints that divergent mechanisms of ER stress-induced cell death exist among organisms. Revised model of IRE1α signaling network in mammals The mammalian genome encodes two isoforms of IRE1, IRE1α and IRE1β. The IRE1α is expressed ubiquitously and IRE1α knockout mice exhibit embryonic lethality. On the contrary, the IRE1β expression is restricted and IRE1β knockout mice are viable [45, 46]; therefore, most mammalian UPR research conducts on the IRE1α. IRE1α was identified as a positive regulator for cell survival. It was believed that IRE1α signaling was terminated during irremediable ER stress to enable apoptosis [1, 2, 7, 15, 47, 48]. Nevertheless, recent studies have challenged this concept by showing that IRE1α persistently adjusts protein-folding capacity, actively directs UPR signaling, and executes cell fate determination [49, 50] (Figure 2). IRE1α employs splicing and RIDD to direct cell fate throughout ER stress. Despite Xbp-1 being the only identified IRE1α splicing target, numerous types of RNA are proven to be RIDD substrates [22, 49, 50]. Even though the significance of RIDD targets is not completely understood, some RIDD events are critical for IRE1α-dependent cell fate determination. During the adaptive response, IRE1α conducts RIDD on mRNAs encoding ER-translocating proteins to prevent further increases in protein-folding demand in the ER [50]. To augment protein-folding ability, IRE1α splices the transcription factor Xbp-1 mRNA to induce the transcription of ER quality control components. If attempts to restore ER homeostasis fail, IRE1α ceases to splice Xbp-1 mRNA. Alternatively, IRE1α represses adaptive responses and activates apoptosis through RIDD [49, 50]. During the transition phase, occurring between the adaptive and apoptotic response, RIDD increases ER stress intensity through degradation of selective UPR target genes including ER protein chaperone BiP [50]. Once ER stress intensity reaches its threshold, RIDD initiates apoptosis through repression of anti-apoptotic pre-microRNAs [49]. Caspase-2 (CASP2) is a proapoptotic protease essential for apoptosis execution [51]. Upregulation of CASP2 is an indicator of apoptotic initiation. Through decay of anti-Casp2 pre-microRNAs (miRs), IRE1α activates apoptosis through upregulation of Casp2 (Figure 2) [49]. A close association of IRE1α activity and cell fate determination has been proposed for years [1, 2, 7, 15, 47, 48]. These findings provide direct evidence that IRE1α is a molecular switch and apoptosis executioner during ER stress [49]. It was previously proposed that the attenuation of IRE1 activity allows cells to initiate apoptosis [1, 2, 7, 15, 47, 48]. The identification of the IRE1α-Casp2 pathway elaborates an intriguing IRE1α signaling model: IRE1α-Xbp-1 is active in the adaptive phase and attenuated in the apoptotic phase. In parallel, activation of IRE1α-Casp2 event initiates cell death in the apoptotic phase (Figure 3). Figure 2. IRE1α regulatory mechanisms during ER stress. Open in a new tab Mammalian IRE1α is repressed through a physical interaction with BiP when demand and capacity of protein folding is balanced in the ER. A dissociation of IRE1α from BiP due to an elevated level of unfolded protein in the ER leads to activation of IRE1α. The IRE1α activating processes include its auto-phosphorylation, conformational change, and higher order assembly. IRE1α directs cell fate decision through unconventional splicing and Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay (RIDD). To prevent increasing demand of ER protein folding, IRE1α conducts RIDD to degrade the transcripts of ER-translocating proteins. In parallel, IRE1α unconventionally splices the transcript of Xbp-1 transcription factor. The spliced XBP-1 enters into the nucleus to transcriptionally reprogram UPR target genes, including ER chaperones. Under irremediable ER stress, IRE1α ceases to splice Xbp-1 mRNA. Instead, IRE1α operates RIDD on selective UPR target genes including BiP to enhance the ER stress intensity. Once the ER stress intensity reaches its threshold, IRE1α represses anti-Casp2 microRNA, miR-17, miR-34a, miR-96, and miR-125b through RIDD. IRE1α-mediated degradation of anti-Casp2 microRNAs leads to activation of apoptotic initiator Casp2 and subsequently triggers the mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis.Figure 3. Updated model of IRE1α and PERK signaling in cell fate determination during ER stress. Open in a new tab The UPR signaling aimed for cell survival is considered an adaptive response during ER stress. Under irremediable ER stress, UPR represses the adaptive response and triggers an apoptotic response. IRE1α and PERK are two ER stress sensors that decrease ER protein folding demand through mRNA decay and translational inhibition, respectively. Both PERK and IRE1α signaling appear to persist throughout ER stress. IRE1α differentially triggers diverse UPR according to need. In the adaptive phase, to increase protein folding capcity, IRE1α-mediated Xbp-1 mRNA splicing is activated for transcriptional regulation of UPR target genes. In a transition phase between the adaptive and apoptotic responses, the signaling mediated by IRE1α-Xbp-1 is attenuated. In parallel, IRE1α incrases ER stress intensity through mRNA decay of selective UPR target genes including ER chaperones. During the apoptotic phase, IRE1α-Casp2 signaling is activated to initate cell death.Is mammalian IRE1α the only major trigger of ER stress-induced apoptosis? IRE1α is necessary and sufficient to trigger apoptosis while PERK and ATF6 are dispensable in the apoptosis activation [49]. Nonetheless, it cannot be excluded that distinct ER stress sensors may serve as major executioners of cell death in a context-specific manner. Using chemical genetic tools, the regulatory roles of the phosphor-transfer and RNase activity of IRE1α in UPR can be examined separately. The phosphor-transfer function is dispensable for Xbp-1 mRNA splicing and upregulation of CASP2 expression; however, it is required for the subsequent CASP2 cleavage and apoptosis activation, indicating that IRE1α phosphor-transfer function is essential for cell fate switch during ER stress [49, 50]. Notably, the phosphor-transfer function is mostly studied through an in vitro conditional IRE1α induction that mimics ER stress. While this experimental system is valuable to distinguish phosphor-transfer and RNase function of IRE1α, it is important to note that ATF6 and PERK are not activated through ER stress. A potentially compromised crosstalk among UPR arms raises a possibility that the IRE1α induction system might not completely resemble a genuinely biological scenario of ER stress. Hence, careful data interpretation from the conditional induction system and integration of in vivo analyses are necessary to determine whether IRE1α is the master trigger in ER stress-induced apoptosis.The substrate specificity of mammalian IRE1α While the four identified IRE1α-cleaved microRNAs, miR-17, miR-34a, miR-96, and miR-125b repress the common substrate Casp2, TXNIP is another target of miR-17 [52]. TXNIP is involved in β-cell death and was selected to potentially regulate ER stress-induced apoptosis based on its rapidly elevated expression under severe ER stress. Similar to the IRE1α mutation, TXNIP mutation leads to compromised apoptosis activation, indicating that TXNIP is essential for ER stress-induced apoptosis [52, 53]. While PERK-eIF2α activates TXNIP transcription, IRE1α increases TXNIP expression by degradation of miR-17. Accordingly, it is conceivable that each of four IRE1α-cleaved microRNAs might have specific substrates such as TXNIP. Based on this scenario, IRE1α might differentially degrade its individual target microRNA for fine-tuning of UPR. Another interesting feature of mammalian RIDD is that distinct substrates comprise a degree of sequence similarity within the cleavage site, whereas the flanking sequences of the cleavage sites are relatively divergent [49, 54]. This suggests that the cleavage mechanisms are likely to be conserved while the flanking sequence determines the specificity of substrate recognition. This scenario would support the hypothesis that IRE1α adjust its RNase substrate specificity to activate diverse UPR. The flexibility of IRE1α to target different substrates might rely on combinations of phosphorylation status, conformational changes, and physical associations with IRE1α regulators. As alterations of IRE1α substrate specificity lead to opposite cell fates [50], further understanding of IRE1α substrate preferences will reveal how IRE1α coordinates cellular homeostasis to determine cell fate under ER stress. Currently the target-switch of RIDD has only been reported in animals. Therefore, in order to gain a deeper understanding of UPR evolution in eukaryotes, further studies are needed to determine whether similar mechanisms exist in yeast and plants.Plant IRE1 in ER stress response and cell fate determination Despite the conservation of IRE1 among eukaryotes, divergent IRE1-dependent regulatory events have also been observed between plants and mammals. These evolutionarily conversed and divergent mechanisms are likely the reason for different ER stress and cell fate phenotypes observed between plants and mammals. Unlike mammalian IRE1 isoforms, the two Arabidopsis IRE1 isoforms are expressed ubiquitously with a limited tissue-specific expression pattern [55, 56]. There is no significant defect of UPR in single mutants of Arabidopsis IRE1A or IRE1B while Arabidopsis ire1 double mutants display compromised ER stress tolerance and a UPR activation phenotype [17, 18]. These observations indicate that the two Arabidopsis IRE1 homologues share partially overlapping function during the UPR. Evidence for established, dominant or specific roles of individual Arabidopsis IRE1 isoforms during UPR and cell fate regulation need to be further elucidated. Notably, it is experimentally undetermined that viable Arabidopsis ire1b are knockouts or partial loss-of-function mutants. Failure to recover a homozygous plant of putative IRE1B knockout hints that Arabidopsis IRE1B might be an essential gene similar to mammalian IRE1α [57]. Interestingly, although mammalian IRE1α is essential for UPR in goblet cells, in other cell types, there is no detectable defect in UPR target gene induction in a mammalian ire1 double mutant likely due to partially overlapping function with ATF6 and PERK [46, 58]. In contrast, although two functional homologs of ATF6, bZIP28 and bZIP17, exist in Arabidopsis [33] (Figure 1), Arabidopsis ire1 double mutants exhibit dramatic reduction of UPR target gene activation [17, 18]. These data indicate that the UPR is partially diversified between mammals and plants. On the contrary, similar IRE1 features are also observed between plants and mammals. For instance, ire1 and xbp1-1 mutants display differential phenotypes despite both being essential genes. Likewise, the mutant of Arabidopsis IRE1 splicing target, bZIP60, shows comparable ER stress tolerance with the wild type plants as opposed to Arabidopsis ire1 double mutant [17], supporting the hypothesis that the function of Arabidopsis IRE1 is not restricted to unconventional splicing like mammalian IRE1. Interestingly, mutations of IRE1 in plants and mammals lead to opposite effects in ER stress-induced cell death phenotypes [17, 18, 32]. Ire1α−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit a greater survival rate than Ire1α+/+ MEFs under ER stress, supporting that mammalian IRE1 is an apoptosis executioner. Contrarily, Arabidopsis ire1 double mutants display compromised ER stress tolerance, instead of a greater survival rate [17, 18]. Consistently, DNA fragmentation and ion leakage are enhanced in the Arabidopsis ire1 double mutant during ER stress [32], suggesting that plant IRE1 might not function as an apoptosis executioner like its mammalian counterpart. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that the differences are related to dissimilar experimental settings: mammalian UPR research is mostly conducted in cell culture, while intact organisms are used in plant UPR studies. Moreover, except potential roles in protein loading reduction under ER stress [32], biological significance of the plant RIDD in cell fate determination is unknown. Further experimental validation will reveal whether the plant RIDD could process multiple substrates to control cell fate decisions similar to that seen in mammals.Shared components of UPRosome and apoptosis IRE1α activation is tightly controlled by its interacting protein complex termed UPRosome [15]. Most UPRosome components are involved in apoptosis, supporting that intense crosstalk exists between IRE1α activity and apoptosis activation (Table1). Specifically, although UPRosome comprises multiple components, loss-of-function mutation of the single component, such as PARP16, Bi-1, Aip-1, PTP-1B, NMHCIIB, Jab1, Nck1, and Ask1, is sufficient to alter the IRE1α splicing activity or apoptosis activation [59-66] (Table 1). Moreover, IRE1α-interactor mutants displaying either elevated or declined IRE1α splicing activity can show enhanced apoptosis, indicating that a precise activation level of IRE1α splicing is important for cell survival [59-66]. This further suggests IRE1α activation is controlled by a signaling network that maintains a delicate equilibrium of adaptive and apoptotic responses. A subtle imbalance of the equilibrium could disturb cellular homeostasis and thus alter cell fate determination [59-76]. Furthermore, the observation that a single mutation of UPRosome leads to significant defects in IRE1α signaling hints that IRE1α is differentially regulated in a context-specific manner (Table1). Because UPRosome analyses are conducted under various conditions, systematic and comparable analyses of UPRosome members will connect each hub and thus give a clearer view of IRE1α signaling network.

The ER stress sensors are silent through physical association with BiP, the most abundant ER-resident chaperone. Dissociation with BiP or interaction with unfolded proteins is the major trigger of IRE1 activation. Yeast IRE1 is activated through association with unfolded proteins rather than disassociation with BiP [78]; however, the physical interaction of BiP is a fine-tuning mechanism to ensure that yeast IRE1 is appropriately activated [79]. Unlike yeast IRE1, the activation mechanisms of mammalian IRE1α rely on its dissociation of BiP as opposed to a direct interaction with unfolded proteins [80]. The differences in activation mechanisms between yeast and mammalian IRE1α can be partially explained by the dissimilarity in protein structure within the sensor domain [15]. Surprisingly, a recent study revealed that mammalian IRE1β tends to interact with unfolded proteins like yeast IRE1 and it is unable to associate with BiP [81]. Accordingly, it is possible that, like yeast IRE1, binding of unfolded proteins is the primary trigger of mammalian IRE1β activation. Despite intense studies in mammals and yeast, the plant IRE1 sensing mechanisms are completely undefined. Further structural and functional analyses in plant IRE1 will be instrumental to reveal ER stress sensing mechanisms in plants. Cell-type specific sensing mechanisms: the role of mammalian IRE1β How the cellular homeostasis is maintained in a cell-type specific manner is a fundamental question of cell biology. It has been recently shown that IRE1β is essential for UPR specifically in goblet cells [46]. In goblet cells, IRE1β is dispensable for Xbp-1 splicing and BiP induction. Instead, IRE1β mutation leads to enhance ER stress intensity evidenced by higher level of Xbp-1 splicing and BiP induction. Moreover, IRE1β−/− mice display a distended ER phenotype potentially due to over accumulation of Mucin2 (MUC2), the most prominent protein secreted from goblet cells. This suggests that IRE1β controls MUC2 expression in goblet cells. Thus, IRE1β mutation leads to MUC2 overload in the ER and in turns trigger ER stress [46]. RIDD was proposed to be the mechanism underlying IRE1β regulation on MUC2 level in goblet cells [46]. The cell-type-specific target of IRE1β provides a molecular explanation as to how the UPR maintains a dynamic and specific secretory ability in multicellular organisms. Consistent with the notion that unfolded proteins trigger IRE1β activation, IRE1β might physically interact with specific types of unfolded protein. In the case of goblet cells, IRE1β might specifically monitor the MUC2 level in the ER and adjusts its loading into the ER through RIDD. Based on this scenario, the mammalian ER stress sensors might distinguish the type of unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER and trigger differential UPR signaling. More specifically, if the unfolded proteins are dispensable for cell survival, ER stress sensors could repress the expression of unfolded proteins through RNA decay or translational repression. Conversely, if unfolded proteins are essential for cellular function, the UPR might preferentially augment the expression of chaperones to recover the production of unfolded proteins. While the ER stress duration and intensity are considered major factors in the apoptosis threshold, the type of misfolded protein might be also critical for determination of UPR signaling outputs.Sensing mechanisms beyond protein-folding homeostasis Emerging evidence shows that IRE1 monitors cellular homeostasis beyond sensing unfolded protein accumulation. For instance, CRY1/CRY2-mediated circadian rhythm regulates IRE1α activity in the liver [82], suggesting that IRE1α coordinates ER function to cope with circadian-related physiological processes. These observations provide a link between the IRE1α-dependent UPR, circadian regulation, and liver metabolic processes. More importantly, because circadian rhythm has a substantial influence on UPR activation, time course studies of the UPR will require diligent experimental design and appropriate controls to avoid biases. Recently, lipid homeostasis is proven to impact the UPR activation through an unconventional sensing mechanism as the unfolded-protein-sensing domain of IRE1α and PERK is dispensable for lipid-dependent UPR activation [83]. All together, these observations support that the UPR perceives physiological and cellular signaling beyond ER protein folding homeostasis. Although it is unclear whether plant IRE1 senses signaling beyond protein-folding capacity, an Arabidopsis ire1 double mutant displaying a root-specific phenotype under unstressed conditions hints that plant IRE1 also integrates physiological signals to maintain specific secretory activity [17]; however, this hypothesis is still awaiting experimental validation.Concluding remarks Significant progress on defining IRE1 mechanisms has been achieved. We now know that IRE1 activities are coordinated at a systemic level to cope with dynamic secretion activity. While in vitro experimental systems and conditional IRE1 induction approaches reveal groundbreaking discoveries in the basic UPR knowledge [49, 50, 84-87], we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of UPR in intact organisms. The lethality of the mammalian IRE1α mutant represents a challenge to gaining insights into the IRE1 function in vivo. In contrast, the viability of plant IRE1 mutants enables in vivo analyses to reveal its roles in organ growth, pathogen defense, and abiotic stress responses [17, 33, 88, 89]. Moreover, with the ease of building high order plant mutants, in vivo phenotypic analyses show that Arabidopsis IRE1 and a conserved component of the G protein complex display a synergistic effect in both plant UPR activation and growth regulation. The study underscores that the UPR network can be built in intact organisms using plants as a model system [17]. With more systematic and quantitative studies of UPR in vivo, there are certainly significant findings ahead that will decipher the dynamic UPR maps close to a genuinely physiological scenario. IRE1α degrades anti-Casp2 microRNA to initiate cell death. The phosphor-transfer function of IRE1α is essential for cell fate determination. IRE1 perceives developmental cues and protein folding homeostasis distinctly. Alterations of IRE1α substrate specificity determine cell fates.

The UPR is critical for growth and development; nonetheless, connections between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a link between the UPR and the phytohormone auxin, a master regulator of plant physiology. We show that ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin sensors and transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana. We also demonstrate that an Arabidopsis mutant of a conserved ER stress sensor IRE1 exhibits defects in the auxin response and levels. These data not only support that the plant IRE1 is required for auxin homeostasis, they also reveal a species-specific feature of IRE1 in multicellular eukaryotes.

We further examine the functional relationship of IRE1 and PIN5 by showing that an ire1 pin5 triple mutant enhances defects of UPR activation and auxin homeostasis in ire1 or pin5. Our results imply that the plant UPR has evolved a hormone-dependent strategy for coordinating ER function with physiological processes. Keywords: ER stress, unfolded protein response, auxin response, IRE1, PIN5, Arabidopsis thalianaINTRODUCTION The UPR adjusts the ER protein folding capacity to cope with the dynamic secretory protein demands in cells (Kozutsumi et al. 1988, Schroder and Kaufman 2005). When the ER protein folding machinery is competent, stress sensors are restrained in the ER by ER-resident chaperones (Bertolotti et al. 2000, Kimata et al. 2003). Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates ER stress sensors either by causing them to dissociate from protein chaperones or to associate with unfolded proteins (Bertolotti, et al. 2000, Credle et al. 2005, Gardner and Walter 2011, Kimata et al. 2003). Activated ER stress sensors transmit signals to the nucleus for transcriptional regulation of UPR target genes (Kozutsumi et al. 1988, Schroder and Kaufman 2005). If ER stress is not resolved, the UPR triggers the activation of cell death (Lin et al. 2007). IRE1, the only identified ER stress sensor in yeast, is conserved in multicellular eukaryotes (Cox et al. 1993, Mori et al. 1993). Two IRE1 homologues, AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B, have been proven to be functional ER stress sensors in Arabidopsis (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Nagashima et al. 2011). The activation of IRE1 relies on auto-phosphorylation, conformational modification, and oligomerization. Activated IRE1 splices an intron from the mRNA of a UPR-specific bZIP transcription factor (Cox and Walter 1996). The spliced transcription factor enters the nucleus to control UPR target genes (Cox and Walter 1996). The UPR is critical for numerous fundamental cellular processes (Wu and Kaufman 2006). IRE1 alpha knockout mice exhibit embryonic lethality (Iwawaki et al. 2009). Dysregulation of the UPR contributes to the pathology of several significant diseases, including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer (Marciniak and Ron 2006). In Arabidopsis, mutations of IRE1 lead to a short primary root phenotype (Chen and Brandizzi 2012). Despite the high significance of the UPR in growth and development in multicellular eukaryotes, the regulatory connections between the UPR and other cellular responses remain unclear. Because the hormone auxin has profound roles in most plant developmental processes, nucleus-based auxin signaling and plasma membrane (PM)-based intercellular auxin transport have been intensively studied. Three major classes of auxin signaling regulators exist in the nucleus: TIR1/AFB auxin co-receptors (Dharmasiri et al. 2005, Gray et al. 1999, Kepinski and Leyser 2005), AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors (Gray et al. 2001), and ARF transcription factors (Ulmasov et al. 1997). To initiate the auxin response in the nucleus, TIR1/AFBs and auxin coordinately promote degradation of AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors. Consequently, ARFs are released from repression and activate the transcription of auxin responsive genes (Dharmasiri et al. 2005, Gray, del Pozo et al. 1999, Kepinski and Leyser 2005). Directional (polar) transport between cells is another crucial regulatory aspect of the auxin response. The auxin efflux carriers of the PIN family are the principal components of the polar auxin transport machinery (Petrasek et al. 2006, Wisniewska et al. 2006). Based on protein topology and subcellular localization, PINs can be classified into PM- or ER-localized types (Dal Bosco et al. 2012, Ding et al. 2012, Mravec et al. 2009). While PM-based intercellular auxin transport has been considered the most critical point of regulation in the auxin response, it has recently been revealed that ER-based auxin regulation is also important. A putative auxin receptor, ABP1, and several auxin transporters (PIN5, PIN6, PIN8, and PILSs) have been shown to localize to the ER. The requirement of the ER-localized regulators in the auxin response underscores the existence of ER-based auxin biology (Barbez et al. 2012, Dal Bosco et al. 2012, Mravec et al. 2009). Despite accumulating evidence that the ER is crucial for auxin regulation (Friml and Jones 2010), the physiological impact of ER-based auxin signaling is largely unknown. As the UPR is critical for growth and development, we sought to identify the regulatory connection between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes. Given the central roles of auxin in numerous aspects of plant physiology, we hypothesized that the UPR regulates auxin signaling for coordinating secretory activities and physiological responses. Through biochemical, molecular biology, and genetic analyses, we demonstrate a connection between the UPR and auxin biology. Specifically, we show that ER stress negatively influences auxin signaling and that the ER-based auxin homoeostasis is important for UPR activation, supporting that the plant UPR alters auxin signaling to cope with ER stress. On the contrary, by establishing that IRE1 is required for the auxin responses, our work reveals that IRE1 has a specific role in hormonal signaling. The regulatory connections between the UPR and auxin biology revealed here hint that plants have evolved an organism-specific strategy to maintain balance between stress adaption and growth regulation.RESULTS ER stress alters the expression of auxin regulators To examine whether ER stress modulates the transcription of auxin regulators, we monitored the expression of four auxin co-receptors: TIR1, AFB1, AFB2, and AFB3 (TIR1/AFBs), under ER stress. The UPR was activated by inhibiting protein N-glycosylation using a classical ER stress inducer termed tunicamycin (Tm). Arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to Tm for various periods of time, as adopted in established protocols (Koizumi et al. 2001, Mishiba et al. 2013, Noh et al. 2002). The transcriptional induction of UPR target genes is a molecular indication of UPR activation. To quantify the UPR activation levels, we monitored the transcription of classical UPR activation indicators, BiP1/2 and PDI6 over a 4-h time course of Tm treatment using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses (Kamauchi et al. 2005). BiP1/2 is an ER chaperone essential for the UPR and a primary UPR target gene. PDI6 encodes protein disulfide isomerase. Similar to BiP proteins, upregulation of PDI6 under ER stress contributes to increasing protein-folding capacity in the ER. RT-qPCR showed that both BiP1/2 and PDI6 were induced more than 2-fold at 0.5 h of Tm treatment and their levels increased over the time course of treatment (Figure S1). Interestingly, we found that there was a 20 to 55% percent reduction in the level of TIR1/AFB transcripts 4 h after Tm treatment in wild-type Col-0 seedlings (Figure 1a). These results imply that ER stress negatively influences auxin signaling by repressing TIR1/AFB transcripts. Since TIR1/AFBs activate the auxin response by promoting degradation of the AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors, we sought to determine whether the ER stress-induced repression of TIR1/AFB transcripts resulted in the stabilization of AUX/IAA proteins. To do so, we conducted western blot analyses using transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing DII-VENUS, a fluorescently tagged auxin-interaction domain (DII) of AUX/IAAs that contains the canonical degron responsible for auxin- and TIR1/AFB-mediated protein degradation (Brunoud et al. 2012). As the stabilization of AUX/IAAs is a downstream response of TIR1/AFB reduction, we examined DII-VENUS protein levels 6 h after Tm treatment. Indeed, immunoblot analyses showed that the protein levels of DII-VENUS increased in wild-type Col-0 roots under ER stress treatment (Figure 1b). Consistent with the western blot analysis results, a confocal microscopy approach revealed that DII-VENUS fluorescence levels, and therefore AUX/IAA protein levels, were consistently greater in roots challenged by the ER stress inducer than in mock-treated ones (Figure 1c). Together these observations support that ER stress leads to an increase in AUX/IAA levels, which is most likely a consequence of protein stabilization resulting from the down-regulation of TIR1/AFBs (Figure 1a). Figure 1. ER stress alters the expression of auxin regulators. Open in a new tab (a) RT-qPCR analyses of TIR1, AFB1, AFB2, and AFB3 expression in ten-day-old Col-0 Arabidopsis seedlings after treatment with 5 μg/ml Tm for 0.5, 1, or 4 h. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM) from three independent biological replicates. P-values were calculated by Student’s two-tailed t test against expression levels at 4 h relative to 0 h: TIR1 (P = 0.00036), AFB1 (P = 0.00041), AFB2 (P = 0.00048), AFB3 (P = 0.00032). (b) The levels of DII-VENUS fusion proteins increase upon exposure to ER stress. Ten-day-old DII-VENUS transgenic plants were treated with 5 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6 h. Proteins were extracted from root tissues and the fusion proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP serum (upper panel). Coomassie blue staining gel used as loading control (lower panel). (c) Ten-day-old transgenic plants expressing DII-VENUS were treated with 5 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6 h. Primary root tips were subjected to confocal microscopy analyses. Scale bars = 50 μm. (d) PIN mRNA levels decrease upon exposure to ER stress. RT-qPCR analyses of PIN family transcripts in ten-day-old wild-type Col-0 seedlings during treatment with 5 μg/ml Tm for 0.5, 1, or 4 h. Error bars represent SEM from three independent biological replicates. P-values were calculated against expression levels at 4 h relative to 0 h: PIN1 (P = 0.00221), PIN2 (P = 0.00316), PIN3 (P = 5.4E-05), PIN4 (P = 4.9E-05), PIN5 (P = 6.4E-05), PIN6 (P = 0.00012), PIN7 (P = 0.00353). The transcriptional level of ETR1, an ER-associated ethylene receptor, was unchanged after treatment with Tm for 0.5, 1, or 4 h.Next, we investigated whether ER stress could control the transcription of auxin transporters. Using RT-qPCR analyses, we detected a 30–80% decrease in the mRNA levels of PIN1, PIN2, PIN3, PIN4, PIN5, PIN6, and PIN7 in wild-type Col-0 seedlings during ER stress treatment (Figure 1d). In contrast, the transcriptional levels of an ER-associated ethylene receptor (ETR1), two ER-localized cytokinin receptors (AHK2 and AHK3), three nuclear protein (RAN2, ABH1, and FIB1), and two secretory proteins (VSR1 and SCAMP3) (Ahmed et al. 1997, Chang et al. 1993, Kanneganti et al. 2007, Kierzkowski et al. 2009, Law et al. 2012, Ma et al. 2007, Wulfetange et al. 2011) remained unchanged in ER stress conditions (Figure S2). Thus, we conclude that the Tm-induced decrease in the abundance of TIR1/AFB and PIN transcripts is a specific cellular response. When ER stress was triggered by reduction of disulfide bond formation using dithiotreitol (DTT) treatment, similar down-regulation of TIR1/AFB and PIN transcripts was observed (Figure S3). Overall, these results show that ER stress specifically modulates the auxin response by repressing the transcription of auxin co-receptors and transporters. Next, we examined whether either IRE1 or TIR1/AFBs is essential for ER stress-induced down-regulation of auxin regulators. To do so, we performed the same ER stress treatment coupled with RT-qPCR analyses in an atire1a atire1b double mutant and a tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 mutant (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Dharmasiri et al. 2005). In atire1a atire1b, both TIR1/AFB and PIN transcripts were still reduced under ER stress conditions (Figure 2a, b), similar to the decreased TIR1/AFB and PIN transcripts pattern seen in wild-type Col-0 (Figure 1a). The PIN transcripts also decreased under ER stress conditions in tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 mutant backgrounds (Figure 2b). However, with the exception of PIN7, in atire1a atire1b the PIN and TIR1/AFB transcription levels were further slightly reduced compared to wild-type Col-0 (Figure 2c and S4). In contrast, the reduction of PIN1, PIN2, and PIN4 transcript levels was larger in the tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 mutant compared to wild-type Col-0 (Figure 2c). These data indicate that down-regulation of PIN transcripts on ER stress is partially and slightly affected by mutations of either IRE1 or TIR1/AFBs. These results further suggest that the IRE1 and TIR1/AFBs play unessential but fine-tuning roles in ER stress-mediated repression of auxin regulators. Figure 2.

Mammalian IRE1 controls multiple physiological responses under normal growth conditions. Our findings that auxin signaling is altered under ER stress hint that the UPR participates in the auxin response in plants. Although IRE1 is unessential for ER stress-triggered down-regulation of auxin regulators, we aimed to determine whether IRE1-dependent UPR is required for the auxin response without chemical induction of ER stress. Thus, we performed root inhibition assays to test the sensitivity of exogenous auxin application in atire1a atire1b. To do so, atire1a atire1b and wild-type Col-0 were germinated on medium containing a synthetic auxin analog, 1-naphthaleneacetic-acid (NAA), a naturally occurring auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), or an auxin transport inhibitor, 1-N-Naphthylphthalamic-acid (NPA). Interestingly, we found that atire1a atire1b was significantly less sensitive to exogenously applied NAA, IAA, or NPA than wild-type Col-0 (Figure 3a-c). The findings that atire1a atire1b and wild-type Col-0 displayed comparable root-inhibition responses to three other plant hormone, jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene, indicate that the plant IRE1 has a role specifically in the auxin response, as opposed to general hormones responses or growth regulation (Figure S5). To further confirm that AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B is involved in the auxin response, we investigated the transcriptional activation of auxin-responsive genes in atire1a atire1b upon external application of auxin. RT-qPCR analyses showed that the transcriptional induction of five auxin-responsive genes, IAA3, IAA5, IAA19, IAA20, and GH3.6, was compromised after 2 and 4 h of NAA treatment in atire1a atire1b relative to wild-type Col-0 (Figure 3d and Figure S6a). The lower induction of auxin-responsive genes was repeatedly observed after both 1 and 2 h of IAA treatment (Figure S6b). These data further indicate that atire1a atire1b exhibits an impaired response to exogenously applied auxin. The transcription of BiP1/2 or PDI6 was not significantly altered under IAA or NPA treatment in wild-type Col-0, suggesting that IAA or NPA treatment does not trigger ER stress like Tm treatment (Figure S7). Furthermore, we found that there was a 30% reduction in the free auxin level in roots of ten-day-old atire1a atire1b plants compared to wild-type Col-0 (Figure 3e). While IRE1 is required to maintain the free auxin level without ER stress treatment, the free auxin level remained unaffected within 4 h after Tm treatment (Figure S8). All together, these data support that plant IRE1 is required for auxin response and homeostasis. Figure 3. atire1a atire1b (ire1) exhibits compromised auxin responses.

P-value is relative to Col-0: P = 4.9E-05.ER-localized auxin regulators are involved in UPR activation Our observations that auxin signaling is regulated by ER stress led us to test whether auxin homeostasis influences UPR activation. To this end, we examined whether mutations in auxin signaling, polar transport, or biosynthesis affected the induction of UPR target genes. Intriguingly, we found that a mutation in PIN5 or PIN6, two ER-localized auxin transporters, compromised UPR activation under ER stress. Compared to wild type, pin5-5 (Mravec et al. 2009) and pin6-4 (Cazzonelli et al. 2013) exhibited a 30–40% reduction in the level of BiP1/2 and PDI6 transcripts during ER stress treatment (Figure 4a and S9). These data imply that ER-based auxin homeostasis contributes to UPR regulation in plants. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that mutants of other types of ER-localized putative auxin transporters, pils2-2, pils5-2, and pils2-2 pils5-2 (Barbez et al. 2012) exhibited similar defects in UPR activation (Figure 4a and S9). We found that the expression levels of BiP1/2 and PDI6 were comparable among wild-type Col-0 and the auxin mutants without ER stress treatment (Figure S10), supporting that the ER-localized auxin transporters are involved in ER stress-triggered UPR activation. In contrast, we found no significant differences in the induction of UPR target genes in mutants defective in either PM-localized auxin exporters, pin1-1 (pin1), eir1-1 (pin2), pin3-4 (pin3), pin4-3 (pin4), pin7-2 (pin7), pin3-5 pin4-3 pin7-1 (pin3 pin4 pin7), an overexpressor of PIN1 (OxPIN1), or the auxin importer aux1-22 (aux1) compared to wild-type Col-0 under the same ER stress treatment conditions (Okada et al. 1991, Roman et al., 1995, Zádníková et al., 2010, Friml et al. 2002, Friml et al. 2003, Sauer et al. 2006, Swarup et al. 2004) (Figure 4b). These results show that ER-based intracellular auxin transport, but not intercellular auxin transport, is required for the optimal UPR activation in plants. Figure 4. Mutants impaired in intracellular auxin transport display a defective UPR phenotype. Open in a new tab (a) RT-qPCR analyses of BiP1/2 and PDI6 in ten-day-old pin5-5 (pin5), pin6-4 (pin6), pils2-2 (pils2), pils5-2 (pils5), pils2-2 pils5-2 (pils2 pils5), abp1-5 (abp1), YUC, and tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 (tir1 afb) relative to wild-type Col-0 Arabidopsis seedlings after a 1-h treatment with 5 μg/ml Tm. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM) from three independent biological replicates.

Error bars represent SEM from three independent biological replicates.We next investigated whether the ER-localized putative auxin receptor ABP1 and the auxin biosynthesis enzyme YUC were also involved in the UPR activation. Similar to the auxin mutants defective in ER-based transport, the abp1-5 and YUC (Xu et al. 2010, Zhao et al. 2001) mutants also exhibited reduced levels in the activation of UPR target genes under ER stress (Figure 4a and S9). Conversely, the transcription levels of UPR target genes were higher in the tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 auxin co-receptor mutant than in wild-type Col-0 (Figure 3a and S9), suggesting that TIR1/AFBs plays a negative role in UPR target gene induction. Altogether, these data highlight that the ER-based regulation of auxin homeostasis may operate as a molecular link between the UPR and other cellular processes. pin5 enhances the ire1 phenotype in auxin responses and UPR activation To investigate a functional relationship of IRE1 and PIN5 in the UPR and auxin response, we generated an atire1a atire1b pin5 triple mutant and performed phenotypic analyses. Consistent with previous reports, atire1a atire1b and pin5-5 displayed a short primary root phenotype (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Mravec et al. 2009). We found that the roots of the atire1a atire1b pin5 triple mutant were significantly shorter than those of atire1a atire1b or pin5-5 (Figure 5a). However, atire1a atire1b, pin5-5, and atire1a atire1b pin5 showed comparable lateral root density and hypocotyl length to wild-type Col-0 (Figure S11), suggesting that the IRE1 and PIN5 have a role specifically in regulation of primary root elongation. In addition, atire1a atire1b pin5 also displayed lower free auxin levels compared to atire1a atire1b or pin5-5 (Fig 5b). Specifically, compared to wild-type Col-0, the roots of pin5-5 and atire1a atire1b exhibited a 15 and 30% reduction in free auxin levels, respectively. Nonetheless, the roots of atire1a atire1b pin5 displayed a 45% reduction in free auxin level (Figure 5b). Finally, in agreement with previous findings (Mravec et al. 2009), root inhibition assays showed that pin5-5 was less sensitive than wild-type Col-0 to low concentrations of IAA but displayed a normal response to NAA, NPA, or high concentrations of IAA (Mravec et al. 2009). Intriguingly, the atire1a atire1b pin5 mutant was significantly less sensitive than atire1a atire1b to all three treatments (Figure 5c-e). A comparable root-inhibition response to JA, ABA, and ethylene in atire1a atire1b pin5 indicated that the genetic interaction between IRE1 and PIN5 is specific to the auxin response (Figure S5). Figure 5. pin5 enhances the auxin and ER stress response phenotype in atire1a atire1b (ire1). Open in a new tab (a) pin5-5 (pin5) enhances the short root phenotype of ire1.

Error bars represent SEM from three independent biological replicates. P-value is ire1 pin5 relative to ire1: *P = 0.01856.We next tested the functional relationship of IRE1 and PIN5 under ER stress. RT-qPCR revealed that the induction of BiP1/2 and PDI6 was also reduced in atire1a atire1b pin5 compared to atire1a atire1b or pin5-5, supporting that PIN5 participates in the UPR activation in a manner not entirely dependent on IRE1. Altogether, our results imply that regulation of ER-based auxin homeostasis is part of ER stress adaptive mechanisms that plants have evolved to parallel the classical UPR signaling pathways.DISCUSSION Our findings uncover an unpredicted but critical regulatory relationship between two fundamental signaling pathways in plants, the UPR and auxin response. Studies of the mammalian UPR indicate that distinct UPR signaling pathways mediate specific physiological processes (Wu and Kaufman 2006). While the IRE1-dependent mRNA splicing event is the most evolutionarily conserved UPR pathway in eukaryotes, IRE1 has also evolved specific functions in multicellular organisms to associate the UPR with more complex physiological processes (Hetz et al. 2006, Urano et al. 2000). Nevertheless, our understanding of the connection between the UPR and other cellular processes is still in its infancy. Here, we have defined a plant-specific regulatory role for IRE1 in the auxin response. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that IRE1 regulates auxin response independently from the classical UPR, it is plausible that IRE1-dependent UPR signaling is involved in auxin transport. The auxin transport is one of the most crucial regulatory mechanisms in the auxin biology. As most regulatory components of the auxin transport system are secretory proteins, we speculate that the IRE1-dependent UPR signaling maintains a robust and efficient membrane trafficking system for the supply of functional auxin regulators. The identification of auxin regulators directly controlled by IRE1 will elucidate how IRE1 modulates specific aspects of auxin biology to coordinate the secretory pathway with physiological responses. Together with the involvement of UPR-specific membrane tethered transcription factors in brassinosteroid signaling (Che et al. 2010), our results support the significance of the plant UPR in hormone signaling. IRE1 regulates the UPR through various mechanisms including unconventional splicing, RNA decay, and protein-protein interaction. It has recently been reported that similar to its mammalian counterpart, plant IRE1 controls gene expression through RNA decay in addition of splicing bZIP60 transcription factor (Mishiba et al. 2013). Mammalian IRE1 operates RNA decay to trigger diverse UPR signaling pathways. It would be interesting to test whether plant IRE1 also relies on its RNA decay function for the auxin response. If IRE1-dependent RNA decay contributes at least partially to the regulation of auxin signaling on ER stress, it would represent a specific regulatory event of the UPR as opposed to random RNA decay under stress. Notably, we have established that IRE1 is required for the optimal auxin response under exogenously applied auxin (Figure 3 and 6a), but plays only partial role in ER stress-induced down-regulation of auxin regulators (Figure 2). These findings support that distinct mechanisms regulate auxin signaling under various conditions to achieve context-specific auxin responses. Figure 6. Working model. Open in a new tab (a) IRE1 is required for the auxin responses upon external auxin application. IRE1, ER- and PM-localized PINs are involved in the maintenance of auxin homeostasis without chemical induction of ER stress. (b) ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin receptors TIR1/AFBs, ER- and PM-localized PINs. IRE1 and ER-localized PINs are required for the optimal induction of UPR target genes.We have established that only ER-localized auxin transporters, but not PM-localized auxin exporters or importers, are required for the optimal UPR activation (Figure 6b). Studies of ER-localized auxin regulators suggest that a distinct auxin signaling pathway exists in the ER (Friml and Jones 2010). Accordingly, we propose that ER-based auxin signaling actively transports free auxin through the ER membranes to modulate the signaling response in the nucleus. More specifically, plant cells can transmit signals between sub-cellular compartments by adjusting the free auxin level in the ER, cytosol, and nucleus. We thus propose a previously uncharacterized cellular function for auxin as a signaling molecule that connects subcellular compartments and maintains cellular homeostasis in plants. It has long been believed that intercellular polar auxin transport is the key regulatory component of the auxin response; however, the biological significance of intracellular auxin transport has been overlooked. Our findings support a specific cellular function of ER-based intracellular auxin distribution in the UPR activation, and thus emphasize the importance of ER auxin biology in plant physiology. We have shown that ER-localized auxin transporters have a role in the UPR activation. A plausible hypothesis to explain this is that the auxin levels in the ER lumen contribute to UPR activation on ER stress. Namely, ER-localized auxin transporters or their associated proteins might sense ER stress and rapidly adjust auxin levels in the ER lumen. The consequent fluctuation of auxin levels in the ER could in turn affect the magnitude of UPR activation. Nevertheless, because a mutation of PIN5 enhances the atire1a atire1b mutant phenotype in the UPR activation (Figure 5f), PIN5-dependent regulation of auxin levels under ER stress does not completely rely on IRE1. Whether ER-localized auxin transporters can directly monitor ER stress or indirectly sense ER stress-related cellular homeostasis is yet to be established; however, the findings presented here support that ER-localized transporters play a role in the UPR activation. Once a reliable system to monitor auxin levels in the ER lumen is developed, it will be interesting to experimentally confirm that ER-localized transporters mediate auxin transport between ER lumen and cytosol on ER stress. PIN5 has been proposed to play a unique role in the auxin response since its transcriptional regulation and regulatory mechanisms appear to be different from PM-localized PINs. It was reported that the transcription of PIN5 is decreased under exogenous application of auxin although PIN5 is required for the auxin response (Mravec et al. 2009). Likewise, our study also showed that ER stress induces a decrease in the transcription of PIN5 while PIN5 is required for the optimal induction of UPR activation. As the PIN5 protein levels have not been monitored under auxin or ER stress treatment, one possibility is that the down-regulation of PIN5 transcript represents a feedback regulatory mechanism. Namely, the cellular availability or the activity of PIN5 may be increased in response to ER stress (e.g. by protein stabilization events or post-translational modifications). This in turn may cause reduction of PIN5 transcriptional levels to safeguard cellular auxin homeostasis. Another possibility is that ER stress represses general auxin responses including inter- and intra-cellular auxin transport to optimize cellular responses to cope with stress. Thus, both PM- and ER-localized transporter are down-regulated under ER stress; however, a basal level of ER-localized transporters may be still required for optimal induction of UPR target gene as they might be involved in stress signal transmission through transport the auxin between subcellular compartments. Thus, mutants of ER-localized auxin regulators would display a compromised UPR activation. Further experimental evidences are needed to verify the possibilities. Nonetheless, our data support that regulation of PIN5 transcripts is a mechanism to maintain PIN5-related cellular homeostasis. Also, pin5-5 was shown to have a higher free auxin levels (Mravec et al. 2009) but we found that pin5-5 displayed lower free auxin level. This is possibly because unlike Mravec et al, which used intact seedlings, we used only root tissues in the free auxin level assay. Future comprehensive quantification analyses of free auxin levels in various tissues will likely reveal whether PIN5 regulates auxin distribution among tissues. The molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional down-regulation of auxin receptors and transporters on ER stress are still unknown. Whether UPR regulators can directly control transcription of auxin receptors and transporters or ER stress-dependent cellular responses mediate auxin homeostasis in a manner independent of classical UPR regulation awaits further validation. In contrast to animals, plants, as sessile organisms, have an extraordinary plasticity in post-embryonic development, responding to both internal and external cues. Nonetheless, our understanding of how plants integrate developmental and environmental signals to balance growth and adaptive regulation is limited. The inter-regulation between the UPR and auxin response demonstrated in this study opens a new area of investigation in plant physiology. Given the essential roles of the UPR in multiple stresses adaptation, the integrated action of the UPR and auxin response highlights a plant-specific strategy that evolved to maintain the crucial balance between stress response and growth regulation for ultimate fitness.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Plant material and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) plants were used. Surface-sterilized seeds were plated directly onto petri dishes containing half-strength Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) medium, 1.5% w/v sucrose, and 0.4% Phytagel (Sigma). For normal growth conditions, plants were grown at 21°C under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle.Tm treatment Seeds were germinated and grown on half-strength LS medium for 10 days, and then transferred to half-strength LS medium containing 5 μg/ml Tm (Sigma) for the indicated periods of time.RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted from whole seedlings using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I (Qiagen). All samples within an experiment were reverse-transcribed simultaneously using SuperScript® VILO™ Master Mix, (Invitrogen). A no-RT reaction, in which RNA was subjected to the same conditions of cDNA synthesis but without reverse transcriptase, was included as a negative control in all real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays. RT-qPCR with SYBR Green detection using a relative standard curve method was performed in triplicate using the Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast Real-Time 7500 PCR system. Data were analyzed by the summary of efficiency (DDCT) method. The values presented are the mean of three independent biological replicates. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S1.Phenotypic analysis Root length and hypocotyl elongation measurements were averaged from 30 plants for each genotype. Data were analyzed by Student’s two-tailed t-test, assuming equal variance; differences with a P-value < 0.05 were considered significant.Immunoblotting and confocal microscopy analyses Fifty milligrams of fresh root tissues was ground in plastic tubes with plastic pestles using liquid nitrogen and 500 ml of SDS-containing extraction buffer (60 mM Tris-HCL (pH 8.8), 2% SDS, 2.5% glycerol, 0.13 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and 1X Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Complete (Roche)). The tissue lysates were vortexed for 30 s, heated at 70°C for 10 minutes, and then centrifuged at 13,000 g twice for 5 minutes at room temperature. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes. For SDS-PAGE analysis, 5 ml of the extract in 1x NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) was separated on 4–12% NuPage gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF (polyvinyl difluoride) membrane. The membrane was incubated with 3% BSA in 1x TBST (50 mM Tris-base, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) overnight at 4°C, and was probed with antibody (α-GFP, 1:20,000; Abcam) diluted in the blocking buffer (1:20,000) at room temperature for 1 h. The probed membrane was washed three times with 1x TBST for 5 min and then incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG for α-GFP, 1:20,000; Abcam) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was further washed four times with 1x TBST for 10 min before the signals were visualized with SuperSignal® West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology). To visualize YFP fluorescence, an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope Zeiss LSM510 was used to detect the DII expression.Free IAA analysis Approximately 20 roots were cut from ten-day-old seedlings and trasferred into an Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml of methanol. Internal standard of [2H5] IAA was added to the sample at amount of 100 fmol per root.Supplementary Material Supp Fig S1-S11Figure S1. Tunicamycin induces activation of UPR target gene. Figure S2.

Besides its major role as the gateway to the secretory pathway the ER is central to adaptation against abiotic and biotic stress. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on ER dynamics and architecture, the association and interaction of the ER with other organelles as well as its role in stress translation and adaptation (Figure 1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Schematic representation of topics covered in the special issue. Numbers correspond to review articles as follows: (1) Griffing et al.

(2014), When supply does not meet demand-ER stress and plant programmed cell death, (11) Cai et al. (2014), Endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced PCD and caspase-like activities involved.The ER is a dynamic network of membrane tubules and sheets. Movement of the ER along the actin cytoskeleton has a significant influence on both its architecture and dynamics. Members of class XI myosin motor proteins have recently been shown to control the movement of the ER and other organelles such as Golgi bodies, peroxisomes and mitochondria. Griffing et al. (2014) explore a subset of class XI myosins with a focus on their role in regulating ER network remodeling by affecting ER tubulation, sheet formation and the persistence of these structures. In addition to the importance of these ER network dynamics for organelle communication, the ER may further directly provide the source membrane for vacuole biogenesis, as hypothesized by Viotti (2014). The majority of soluble vacuolar proteins travel from the ER to the Golgi complex. A growing number of reports however indicate that some proteins, including some vacuolar membrane proteins appear to reach the vacuole without visiting intermediate compartments of the endomembrane system. An essential function of the ER is the synthesis of secreted proteins. To insure that only correctly folded proteins are exported from the ER, eukaryotes have evolved ER quality control (ERQC) mechanisms, which supervise the folding process. Protein folding is monitored through the stepwise modification of oligosaccharide side chains on glycoproteins, and proteins that fail to fold correctly are extracted from the folding process and subjected to ER associated degradation (ERAD). Li and Liu (2014) describe the protein folding process and how client proteins are chosen for ERAD. Proper function of the ER is particular relevant under stress where the demand for secreted proteins exceed the ER working load capacity. Under such conditions, ER homeostasis requires cellular communication between the ER and the nucleus. Therefore, eukaryotes have signaling proteins on the ER membrane that sense impaired ER function (ER stress) through the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER and that employ different strategies to signal the nucleus. Some of these communication strategies are common to all eukaryotes, while others are unique to plants. Ruberti and Brandizzi (2014) compare the ER stress signal pathways between yeast, plants and animals and review the responses in plants, which vary from adaptive measures to cell death. The bZIP transcription factor bZIP28 represents an ER stress signaling factor that is tethered to the ER membrane under unstressed conditions but is mobilized and transferred to the nucleus upon stress. Srivastava et al. (2014) describe the structure of bZIP28 and underlying principles of bZIP28 mobilization in response to stress. ER stress activates the unfolded proteins response (UPR) and the ERAD system to eliminate misfolded proteins, which is vital for the establishment of an effective immune system. Tintor and Saijo (2014) introduce the significance of the ERQC in the synthesis of immune receptors and provide further insights into the causalities of ER function (UPR) and plant immunity. Despite its role in immunity, the ER has been hijacked by viruses to promote viral pathogenesis. As reviewed by Verchot (2014), viruses have developed sophisticated strategies to overload the ER protein folding machinery with viral encoded proteins in infected cells. Interestingly, this activates the UPR and up-regulates cellular chaperones that further aid in virus protein folding. The overall significance of the ER in stress adaption is however apparent and underlined by the review of Nakano et al. (2014) which, in addition to the biogenesis and evolution, discusses the putative function of ER bodies in abiotic and biotic stress. As ER-derived compartments ER bodies contain stress-associated proteins (e.g., various β-glucosidases of the PYK10 family) that are thought to enhance stress resilience by activating glucosinolates and glucosylated phytohormones. The study of Höwing et al. (2014) further identified an immune-active function of the ER-localized cysteine endopeptidase AtCEP1. In addition to its function in developmental processes, AtCEP1 is expressed and localized to the ER network, which condenses around haustoria during powdery mildew infection. Knockout of AtCEP1 results in enhanced susceptibility, suggesting that AtCEP1 is involved in restricting fungal infection, possibly by controlling a defense-related programmed cell death (PCD) at the late stages of the interaction. Cells mount adaptive responses (e.g., UPR) to mitigate the damage caused by ER stress. However, when stress becomes so excessive that the ERQC system cannot meet the demands, then PCD ensues. Williams et al. (2014) review the possible links between the UPR and PCD and discuss the involvement of calcium signaling and N-rich proteins in promoting PCD and the role of ER chaperones in limiting it as well as the connection of pathogens to ER-mediated cell death. Cai et al. (2014) finally compare the activation and/or regulation of ER stress-induced PCD in animals and plants and highlight the significance of caspase and caspase-like activities in underlying PCD processes. The articles published in this e-book summarize our current knowledge of the multi-functionality of the ER in stress adaptation. By providing a stable microenvironment for the synthesis of metabolites and secreted proteins, the ER functions as an intracellular stress sensory organelle and, accordingly, initiates and regulates adaptive responses to environmental stress. Understanding the molecular basis of these processes and the role of ER architectural dynamics therein is of high relevance for sustainable crop production. We hope our e-book will stimulate research in the field to further enhance our knowledge of ER biology in plants.

Copyright notice ID: 4378170 PMID: 25673778 Depleting galactose from the cell wall polysaccharide xyloglucan leads to a disruption of diverse cellular and physiological processes involved in normal plant growth.Abstract Xyloglucan is a polysaccharide that has important roles in the formation and function of the walls that surround growing land plant cells. Many of these plants synthesize xyloglucan that contains galactose in two different side chains (L and F), which exist in distinct molecular environments. However, little is known about the contribution of these side chains to xyloglucan function. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 (MUR3) form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated xylose than its wild-type counterpart. The galactose-depleted xyloglucan is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that are dwarfed with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, and short inflorescence stems. Moreover, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectin, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. Near-normal growth is restored by generating mur3 mutants that produce no detectable amounts of xyloglucan. Thus, cellular processes are affected more by the presence of the dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating xyloglucan altogether. To identify structural features responsible for xyloglucan dysfunction, xyloglucan structure was modified in situ by generating mur3 mutants that lack specific xyloglucan xylosyltransferases (XXTs) or that overexpress the XYLOGLUCAN L-SIDE CHAIN GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE2 (XLT2) gene. Normal growth was restored in the mur3-3 mutant overexpressing XLT2 and in mur3-3 xxt double mutants when the dysfunctional xyloglucan was modified by doubling the amounts of galactosylated side chains. Our study assigns a role for galactosylation in normal xyloglucan function and demonstrates that altering xyloglucan side chain structure disturbs diverse cellular and physiological processes. There have been considerable advances in understanding how changes in specific amino acids or nucleotides affect the ability of a protein or an RNA to fold and to function (Wan et al., 2011; Sauer, 2013). By contrast, much less is known about how polysaccharide structure and function are affected by altering specific monosaccharides within its glycosyl sequence. Here, we report that xyloglucan, a plant cell wall polysaccharide, becomes dysfunctional rather than nonfunctional when its glycosyl sequence is altered. The term dysfunctional polysaccharide is used here to describe a structure that, in and of itself, has a deleterious effect on the growth and development of a plant. XXXG-type xyloglucans (XyGs; Fig. 1A) are present in the cell walls of many flowering plants (Hoffman et al., 2005), gymnosperms (Hsieh and Harris, 2012), ferns and their allies, club and spike mosses, and the avascular hornworts (Peña et al., 2008). XyGs of this type are composed of subunits (Fig. 1, A and B) that have three consecutive β-d-glucopyranose (β-d-Glcp) backbone residues bearing a side chain followed by a single unbranched β-d-Glcp residue (Tuomivaara et al., 2015). Little is known about the contribution of these side chains to the role of XyG in wall structure and function, although the results of in vitro studies suggest that they modulate how an XyG interacts with cellulose (Whitney et al., 2006) and with itself (Shirakawa et al., 1998; de Freitas et al., 2011). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Eliminating xyloglucan suppresses the cabbage-like phenotype of mur3-3 plants.

C, Eliminating XyG suppresses the dwarf phenotype of the mur3-3 mutant. mur3-3 was crossed with xxt1 xxt2, and two independent xxt1 xxt2 mur3-3 triple mutants (nos. 12 and 20) were identified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Plants were grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle. D, The glycome profiles of the materials solubilized from the cell walls by enzymatic and KOH treatments. Each extract was probed with a series of monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes of XyG irrespective of the presence or absence of fucosylated side chains and monoclonal antibodies that bind only to XyG containing fucosylated side chains. Yellow, Strong binding; black, no binding. No XyG was detected in the xxt1 xxt2 double mutant or the xxt1 xxt2 mur3-3 triple mutants. E, Cross sections of wild-type and mutant leaves stained with toluidine blue (left column) or immunolabeled with monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes of deesterified homogalacturonan (CCRC-M38), XyG (CCRC-M88), or fucosylated XyG (CCRC-M1). WT, Wild type; EPG, endopolygalacturonase.The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes that encode the glycosyltransferases required for the formation of the XyG side chains have been identified (see Fig. 1A). Five XYLOGLUCAN XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE (XXT1–XXT5) genes encode proteins that have been implicated in the formation of the α-d-xylopyranose-(1→6)-β-d-Glcp linkage (Cavalier et al., 2008; Zabotina et al., 2008; Vuttipongchaikij et al., 2012; Zabotina et al., 2012). Two side chain-specific galactosyltransferases have been characterized (Madson et al., 2003; Jensen et al., 2012). XYLOGLUCAN L-SIDE CHAIN GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE2 (XLT2) catalyzes the addition of Gal to the middle Xyl (Jensen et al., 2012), whereas MURUS3 (MUR3) adds Gal to the Xyl adjacent to the unbranched Glc (Madson et al., 2003). The Gal added by MUR3 is itself the acceptor for FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (FUT1), which adds a fucosyl residue to form the F side chain (Perrin et al., 1999). Up to 60% of the F side chains of Arabidopsis leaf XyG contain O-acetylated Gal (Perrin et al., 2003). Arabidopsis fut1, xlt2, and xxt1 to xxt5 mutants that form structurally abnormal XyG (Vanzin et al., 2002; Madson et al., 2003; Perrin et al., 2003; Peña et al., 2004; Jensen et al., 2012; Schultink et al., 2013) or that have reduced (Zabotina et al., 2008; Vuttipongchaikij et al., 2012; Zabotina et al., 2012) or no discernible amounts of XyG (Cavalier et al., 2008) have no severe developmental or growth phenotypes. This has led plant scientists to question the biological role of XyG in wall assembly and architecture as well as its function in plant growth and development (Cavalier et al., 2008; Park and Cosgrove, 2012a, 2012b). Arabidopsis mur3-1 and mur3-2 mutants, which carry different single-point mutations in MUR3, have been reported to form XyG that lacks F side chains (Madson et al., 2003; Peña et al., 2004), although they do produce discernible amounts of the MUR3 protein (Tamura et al., 2005). Both of these mutants are visibly similar to wild-type plants (Madson et al., 2003; Peña et al., 2004; Tamura et al., 2005). By contrast, mutant plants including katamari1 (kam1-1, kam1-2/mur3-7, and kam1-3/mur3-3; Tamura et al., 2005; Tedman-Jones et al., 2008), constitutive ICS1:luc expression1 (Tedman-Jones et al., 2008), and short root in salt medium (rsa3; Li et al., 2013), which are devoid of functional MUR3, have a dwarf cabbage-like growth phenotype with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, and endomembrane aggregates. Tamura et al. (2005) have proposed that the KAM1/MUR3 protein itself, rather than its galactosyltransferase activity, is required for cell elongation and normal endomembrane organization. This hypothesis is based in part on the assumption that the mur3-1, mur3-2, and mur3-3/kam1-3 mutants all lack MUR3 galactosyltransferase activity, but only the mur3-3/kam1-3 mutant lacks the MUR3 protein itself (Tamura et al., 2005). Here, we provide genetic and chemical evidence that XyG deficient in extended side chains is dysfunctional and is responsible for the growth defects of mur3-3 and mur3-7 plants. The extent of XyG galactosylation is the major factor in determining these effects. The deleterious growth effects caused by this dysfunctional XyG are suppressed by introducing additional mutations that eliminate XyG formation altogether, by mutations that modify XyG structure, or by altering the plant's growth conditions. These observations provide new insight into XyG biosynthesis and the structural requirements that allow XyG to function normally in plant growth and development. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Reducing XyG to below Detectable Levels Suppresses the Dwarf Phenotype of mur3-3 Plants MUR3 encodes an XyG-specific galactosyltransferase responsible for most of the galactosylation of Arabidopsis XyG. To address the possibility that altered XyG structure leads to the phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants lacking functional MUR3, we took a genetic approach to reduce the amounts of XyG to undetectable levels in the mur3-3 mutant. Thus, we crossed mur3-3 with the xxt1 xxt2 double mutant, which has no detectable amounts of XyG in its cell wall (Cavalier et al., 2008; Zabotina et al., 2012). The xxt1 xxt2 mutant grows somewhat more slowly than wild-type plants but does not have a cabbage-like phenotype (Cavalier et al., 2008) or abnormal endomembrane aggregates (Uehara et al., 2014), making it visibly distinct from the mur3-3 mutant (Fig. 1C). The xxt1 xxt2 mur3-3 triple mutant, which produces no discernible XXT1, XXT2, or MUR3 transcripts (Supplemental Fig. S1A), does not have a cabbage-like phenotype and is visibly indistinguishable from the xxt1 xxt2 mutant (Fig. 1C). Toluidine blue-stained cross sections of wild-type, xxt1 xxt2, and xxt1 xxt2 mur3-3 leaves are also visibly similar (Fig. 1E). Most of the mur3-3 cells are smaller than their wild-type counterparts, a result that is in agreement with the proposal that these cells have lost the ability to expand normally (Tamura et al., 2005). Glycome profiling (Fig. 1D) and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1E) indicate that the XyG present in mur3-3 walls is not fucosylated, whereas wild-type walls contain fucosylated XyG. No discernible amounts of XyG were detected in xxt1 xxt2 mur3-3 leaf cell walls (Fig. 1, D and E), nor were xyloglucan oligosaccharides (XyGOs) detected after XyG-specific endoglucanase (XEG) treatment of the 1 and 4 n KOH-soluble materials from xxt1 xxt2 mur3-3 root, leaf, and stem cell walls. Thus, the presence of XyG is strongly correlated with the cabbage-like phenotype of the mur3-3 mutant. Our data suggest that the absence of the MUR3 galactosyltransferase leads to the formation of dysfunctional XyG, and that cellular processes are affected more by the presence of this dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating XyG altogether.The mur3-1, mur3-2, mur3-3, and mur3-7 Phenotypes Are Associated with Altered XyG Chemotypes Since the presence of dysfunctional XyG is correlated with the cabbage-like phenotype of mur3-3 plants, we next determined the structural features of XyG that are associated with this phenotype. To this end, the XyGs from mur3-1, mur3-2, mur3-3, and mur3-7, each of which carries a different mutation in MUR3 (Supplemental Fig. S1B), were structurally characterized. The structures of these XyGs have not previously been compared, since only the distinguishing chemical structures of the mur3-1 XyG have been described (Madson et al., 2003; Peña et al., 2004). Here, the XyGOs generated by XEG fragmentation of leaf XyG obtained from each mutant grown at 19°C (Fig. 2) were characterized using 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Hoffman et al., 2005), matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed-amperometric detection (PAD; Tuomivaara et al., 2015). Figure 2. Open in a new tab The phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the xyloglucan-specific galactosyltransferases MUR3 and XLT2. Plants were grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle or with a 14-h-light (28°C) and 10-h-dark (24°C) cycle. Images were taken when the plants were 4 weeks old.Homozygous mur3-3 and mur3-7 plants, respectively, carry a transfer DNA insertion in the region encoding the exostosin-like domain and the protein’s N terminus (Tedman-Jones et al., 2008; Supplemental Fig. S1B). Both mutants produce no detectable MUR3 transcripts (Supplemental Fig. S1A) and have a cabbage-like phenotype when grown at 19°C in soil (Fig. 2). These mutants are visibly distinct from the mur3-1 and mur3-2 mutants (Fig. 2), both of which produce detectable amounts of the MUR3 protein (Tamura et al., 2005). The 1H-NMR spectrum of the mur3-3 XyGOs contained no discernible signals corresponding to an F side chain at any position or to an L side chain adjacent to the unbranched Glc residue (Fig. 3; Supplemental Table S1). MALDI-TOF MS and HPAEC-PAD confirmed that the mur3-3 XyG is composed entirely of XXXG (63%) and XLXG (37%) subunits (Fig. 4A; Supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). The mur3-7 XyG is also composed of XXXG (73%) and XLXG (27%) subunits (Fig. 4A; Supplemental Fig. S3). Overexpressing MUR3 under the control of a 35S promoter in the mur3-3 mutant rescued the cabbage-like phenotype (Supplemental Fig. S4) and led to the synthesis of XyG containing near wild-type levels of XXFG and XLFG subunits (Fig. 4A; Supplemental Fig. S3). These analyses are in agreement with previous studies showing that MUR3 is a regiospecific galactosyltransferase that adds a Gal residue to the Xyl adjacent to the unbranched Glc in the XyG backbone (Madson et al., 2003; Peña et al., 2004).

Open in a new tab The amounts and subunit compositions of the xyloglucan present in the leaf cell walls of wild-type and selected mur3 mutant plants. A and B, The subunit compositions of XyG present in wild-type and mutant leaves. XyG oligosaccharides were generated by XEG treatment of the 4 n KOH-soluble materials from at least three individual plants and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. HPAEC-PAD (Supplemental Fig. S2) and 1H-NMR analyses (Supplemental Table S1) indicated that XXLG and XLLG account for between 6% and 9% of the subunits in Col-0 and 35SproMUR3:mur3-3 XyG. These subunits were not detected in any of the other plants. C, The amounts of Driselase-susceptible XyG in wild-type and mutant leaves determined from the amounts of isoprimeverose released by Driselase treatment of the cell walls.In contrast to mur3-3, the 1H-NMR spectra of the XyGOs generated from mur3-1 and mur3-2 XyG contained low-intensity signals diagnostic of F side chains (Fig. 3; Supplemental Table S1). Subunits containing F side chains were also discernible in the MALDI-TOF MS and HPAEC-PAD profiles of the mur3-1 and mur3-2 XyGOs (Fig. 4A; Supplemental Figs. S2 and S4). Moreover, the MALDI-TOF MS of the XyGO subunits generated by XEG treatment of mur3-1 and mur 3-2 cell walls contained low-intensity ions corresponding to mono O-acetylated XXFG and XLFG subunits (Supplemental Fig. S5). No O-acetylated XyG subunits were generated by XEG treatment of mur3-3 cell walls (Supplemental Fig. S5). Such results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that the F side chain Gal accounts for the bulk of the O-acetylated glycoses in Arabidopsis leaf XyG (Pauly et al., 2001; Perrin et al., 2003). Our NMR data indicate that mur3-1 and mur3-2 XyGs contain approximately 7% and 14%, respectively, of the F side chain present in wild-type plants (Supplemental Table S1) and are consistent with the results of recent studies indicating that small amounts of the F side chain are present in the xyloglucan isolated from the mur3-1 mutant (Jensen et al., 2012; Schultink et al., 2013; Vinueza et al., 2013). Our data show that the S470L amino acid substitution in mur3-1 has a more severe effect on xyloglucan galactosylation than the A290V substitution in mur3-2. Indeed, the mur3-1 and mur3-2 mutants are not identical, since the etiolated hypocotyls of mur3-1 are approximately 50% shorter than their mur3-2 counterparts (Supplemental Fig. S6). Li et al. (2013) have reported that the roots of the mur3-1 and mur3-2 plants are somewhat less sensitive to salt stress than their rsa3-1 and kam1-3 counterparts and concluded that RSA3/MUR3/KAM1 is important in the salt stress tolerance pathway. We extend this notion by proposing that the phenotype of each mur3 mutant is determined in large part by the extent of residual xyloglucan galactosylation at the MUR3-specific position.Xyloglucan Side Chain Extension Is Increased and the Cabbage-Like Phenotype of mur3-3 and mur3-7 Plants Is Suppressed by Overexpression of XLT2 Our results indicated that reduced extension of XyG side chains is correlated with the cabbage-like phenotype of mur3-3 and mur3-7 plants. To determine if this is the case, we overexpressed XLT2 in the mur3-3 mutant (see Supplemental Fig. S7). The 35Spro:XLT2:mur3-3 plants (36 independent transgenic lines identified) are visibly indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 5) and produce XyG containing less than 15% XXXG (Fig. 4B; Supplemental Fig. S4). Comparable results were obtained when XLT2 was overexpressed in mur3-7 plants. The ability of overexpressed XLT2 to significantly decrease the XXXG content of the XyG while suppressing the cabbage-like phenotype is again consistent with the notion that this phenotype is correlated with the presence of dysfunctional XyG. Indeed, the mild dwarf phenotype of the xlt2 mur3-1 mutant is also rescued by extending the XyG side chains with arabinofuranosyl residues (Schultink et al., 2013). Such data provide further evidence that XyG deficient in extended side chains is dysfunctional, and that the synthesis of dysfunctional XyG leads to abnormal growth. Figure 5. Open in a new tab The phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the xyloglucan-specific galactosyltransferases MUR3 or the xylosyltransferases XXT1, XXT2, and XXT5. Plants were grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle. Images were taken when the plants were 4 weeks old.The Phenotypes of mur3-3 and mur3-7 Plants Are Suppressed by Knocking out XXT2 or XXT5 Plants that had a wild-type phenotype, yet were genotyped as XXT1 xxt2 mur3-3, were obtained during the generation of the xxt1 xxt2 mur3-3 triple mutant, which led us to suspect that abolishing the expression of specific XXT genes suppressed the cabbage-like phenotype. To obtain experimental support for this hypothesis, we generated a series of double mutants by crossing mur3-3 and mur3-7 with the xxt1, xxt2, and xxt5 mutants (see Fig. 5), which themselves have wild-type phenotypes (Cavalier et al., 2008; Vuttipongchaikij et al., 2012; Zabotina et al., 2012). The xxt2-1 mur3-3, xxt2-2 mur3-7, xxt5 mur3-3, and xxt5 mur3-7 mutants were phenotypically comparable with wild-type plants (Fig. 4). The walls of these four double mutants contain 35% to 50% less Driselase-susceptible XyG than the walls of the xxt1 mur3-3, mur3-3, and mur3-7 mutants (Fig. 4C; Supplemental Table S2). Notably, XLXG subunits accounted for at least 59% of the XyG in the normal-looking xxt2-1 mur3-3, xxt2-2 mur3-7, xxt5 mur3-3, and xxt5 mur3-7 mutant plants (Fig. 4B; Supplemental Fig. S4). By contrast, the XLXG subunit accounts for 44% of the XyG from the xxt1 mur3-3 double mutant (Fig. 4B; Supplemental Fig. S3), which retained the cabbage-like phenotype (Fig. 5). Such data are again consistent with the notion that this phenotype is a consequence of the synthesis of XyG deficient in extended side chains. Tamura et al. (2005) have proposed that the cabbage-like phenotype of kam1/mur3 mutant plants is a consequence of abnormal endomembrane organization resulting from the absence of the MUR3 protein. However, the endomembrane aggregation phenotype observed in mur3-3 plants was largely suppressed in the xxt2-1 mur3-3 and xxt5 mur3-3 mutant plants (Fig. 6A) but not in the xxt1 mur3-3 mutant. Our data are thus consistent with the notion that XyG with a high proportion of unsubstituted XXXG subunits is dysfunctional, and that its presence, rather than the absence of a functional MUR3 protein, is strongly correlated with the presence of endomembrane aggregates. Swollen epidermal cells with endomembrane aggregates have been observed in the roots of plants lacking an isoform of UDP-Glc 4-epimerase (uge4; Uehara et al., 2014). The uge4 root XyG contains approximately 50% less Gal than wild-type XyG (Nguema-Ona et al., 2006; Rösti et al., 2007). Membrane aggregation and cell bulging were suppressed by growing uge4 in the presence of Gal, which led to the suggestion that reduced galactosylation of XyG or arabinogalactan protein is responsible for endomembrane disorganization (Uehara et al., 2014). Nevertheless, a direct causal relationship between endomembrane aggregation and plant growth is unlikely, as Arabidopsis plants carrying a mutation in the coat promoter complex II coat protein SECRETORY 24A have endomembrane aggregates comparable to mur3-3 but are not dwarfed (Faso et al., 2009). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Endomembrane aggregation and intracellular accumulation of cell wall polysaccharides in mur3-3 plants. A, Endomembrane aggregation in mur3-3 plants is suppressed by knocking out XXT2 or XXT5. Col-0 (wild-type [WT]) and mutant plants were individually transformed with the SP-2SC-GFP (for signal peptide of pumpkin 2S albumin followed by a linker of GGG and the C-terminal 18-amino acid sequence of pumpkin 2S albumin) construct and grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle or a 14-h-light (28°C) and 10-h-dark (24°C) cycle. Images of epidermal cells of 14-d-old cotyledons expressing the endomembrane-targeted SP-2SC-GFP were obtained using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. Bar = 10 µm. B, Immunocytochemistry reveals intracellular aggregates (see arrows) containing XyG and pectin in mur3 hypocotyls. Top, Toluidine blue-stained cross sections. CCRC-M88 recognizes XyG, CCRC-M1 recognizes fucosylated XyG, and CCRC-M38 recognizes deesterified homogalacturonan. Bar = 50 µm.Intracellular Aggregates Containing Xyloglucan and Pectin Accumulate in the Cells of mur3-3 Hypocotyls Pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides are believed to be synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and are then transferred from the trans-Golgi network in vesicles that move to and fuse with the plasma membrane (Bashline et al., 2014). The polysaccharides are then released into the apoplast and incorporated into the existing cell wall. Defects in trans-Golgi network-dependent secretion of polysaccharides in the echidna mutant have been shown to result in the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing pectin and xyloglucan (Gendre et al., 2013). Thus, we examined polysaccharide secretion in mur3-3, as its cells contain abnormal endomembrane aggregates (Fig. 6A). Intracellular aggregates were clearly visible in the epidermal cells of a toluidine blue-stained cross section of the mur3-3 hypocotyl (Fig. 6B; Supplemental Fig. S8A). Smaller amounts of aggregates were also visible in mur3-1 hypocotyls (Fig. 6B). These aggregates were labeled with monoclonal antibodies that recognize xyloglucan and deesterified homogalacturonan (Fig. 6B). Few, if any, aggregates were discernible in mur3-2, wild-type (Fig. 6B), or 35SproMUR3:mur3-3 hypocotyls (Supplemental Fig. S8B). Taken together, these data provide evidence that, in mur3-3 hypocotyls and to a lesser extent in mur3-1 hypocotyls, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectins, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. These data again support the notion that the phenotype of each mur3 mutant is determined in large part by the amount of catalytically functional MUR3 protein it produces.Temperature Affects the Growth of mur3 Plants and the Catalytic Activity of the Mutated MUR3 Protein Early studies reported that mur3-1 XyG lacks F side chains (Madson et al., 2003; Peña et al., 2004), although subsequent analyses indicated that fucosylated subunits account for up to 5% of the mur3-1 and xlt2 mur3-1 XyGs (Jensen et al., 2012; Schultink et al., 2013; Vinueza et al., 2013). Nevertheless, those values are lower than the values we obtained (Fig. 4A). As our plants were grown at 19°C rather than at 22°C or 26°C as in the earlier studies, we determined whether temperature affects the extent of XyG fucosylation or plant growth. There was an approximately 85% decrease in the relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits in the XyG from mur3-1 and xlt2 mur3-1 plants grown at 28°C (Fig. 7, A and B; Supplemental Fig. S9). xlt2 mur3-1 mutants grown at 19°C or 28°C do not have a severe cabbage-like phenotype but do have short petioles and slightly curved leaves, making them visibly distinct from wild-type plants (Fig. 2). The relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits in mur3-2 XyG was comparable at both growth temperatures (Fig. 7; Supplemental Fig. S9). These data confirm that mur3-1 and mur3-2 plants retain a residual amount of MUR3 activity and show that, in plants with the allelic (S470L) MUR3-1 protein, XyG galactosylation at the MUR3 position is diminished by increasing growth temperature. Figure 7. Open in a new tab The effect of growth temperature on the xyloglucan subunit compositions of selected mur3 and wild-type plants. A, XyG subunit compositions of plants grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle. B, XyG subunit compositions of plants grown with a 14-h-light (28°C) and 10-h-dark (24°C) cycle. XyG oligosaccharides were generated by XEG treatment of the 4 n KOH-soluble materials from at least three individual plants and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. HPAEC-PAD analyses indicated that XXLG and XLLG accounted for approximately 6% of the subunits in Col-0 XyG (see Supplemental Fig. S9).Somewhat surprisingly, the cabbage-like phenotype is suppressed when mur3-3 and mur3-7 plants are grown at 28°C (Fig. 2; Supplemental Fig. S10), even though the cell walls of the mutants still contain XyG, in which the XXXG subunit predominates (Fig. 7B; Supplemental Fig. S9), and the endomembrane aggregates still exist (Fig. 6A). That mur3-3 and mur3-7 exhibit near-normal growth at 28°C is consistent with the temperature-dependent changes in the rheological properties of Gal-depleted XyG (Shirakawa et al., 1998). Alternatively, the protective mechanisms activated in plants in response to heat stress (Bita and Gerats, 2013) may suppress the effects of the dysfunctional mur3-3 XyG. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which elevated temperature suppresses the cabbage-like phenotype remain to be determined. It may well be the case that this phenotype results from an accumulation of temperature- and XyG structure-dependent modifications that affect both cell wall structure and remodeling and endomembrane organization.Dysfunctional Xyloglucan and Plant Growth Our data show that the extent of side chain galactosylation in mur3-3 and mur3-7 XyG is reduced by approximately 70% compared with the wild type. A probability analysis (see Supplemental Protocol S1) using the XXXG subunit abundance in the XyG from mur3-3 (63%), mur3-7 (73%), the wild type (25%), mur3-1 (48%), mur3-2 (47%), and 35SproMUR3:mur3-3 (29%) plants predicts that domains consisting of five or more tandemly repeated XXXG sequences comprise a much higher proportion of the XyG in mur3-3 and mur3-7 plants than in XyG from the other plants (Supplemental Fig. S11). The existence of large tandemly repeated XXXG domains may lead to the aggregation or otherwise aberrant interactions of XyG with itself and/or with other wall polymers (Shirakawa et al., 1998; Whitney et al., 2006; de Freitas et al., 2011). Such interactions together with the inability to extend the side chain adjacent to the unbranched Glc appear to be major factors in the dysfunctional properties of the mur3-3 and mur3-7 XyG and the cabbage-like phenotype of these plants. The aggregation of the nascent mur3-3 and mur3-7 XyGs may prevent the normal movement of XyG through the Golgi and the packaging of XyG in vesicles for delivery to the apoplast, and may also account for the abnormal membrane organization and the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing wall polysaccharides in mur3-3 plants. The differences in subunit composition of the mur3-3 and xlt2 mur3-1 XyGs (Fig. 7) indicate that failure to extend the side chains next to the unbranched Glc is especially detrimental to XyG function and to plant growth. Most, if not all, of the galactosyl residues adjacent to the unbranched Glc are further extended with Fuc in the XyG present in the wall of xlt2 mur3-1 plants. Although XyG fucosylation is not in itself required for the normal growth of laboratory-grown Arabidopsis plants (Vanzin et al., 2002), there is evidence that fucosylation does have a role, albeit less than galactosylation, in the formation of XyG-cellulose composites (Whitney et al., 2006). Dysfunctional xyloglucan may disrupt wall remodeling that is required for plant cells to expand and grow (Peña et al., 2004; Park and Cosgrove, 2012a, 2012b). For example, the results of in vitro studies suggest that the decreased solubility of Gal-depleted XyG reduces its accessibility to the action of XyG endotransglucosylases/hydrolases (XTHs) that are believed to be involved in wall remodeling during cell growth (Peña et al., 2004). Li et al. (2013) have reported that the expression of XTH18 is increased 2-fold in rsa3-1. Thus, the cabbage-like phenotype may result at least in part from the reduced susceptibilities of the XyG to XTH. These authors also reported a 12-fold increase in the expression of the gene encoding the wall-associated kinase WAK1 (Li et al., 2013). Since WAKs are likely involved in wall sensing, cell expansion, and responses to pathogens and environmental signals (Kohorn and Kohorn, 2012), they may have a role in communicating changes in wall properties to the cells of the mur3 mutants. Our data favor a model that invokes a dysfunctional xyloglucan structure as the most direct cause of the growth defects of plants carrying loss-of-function mutations in MUR3. Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be discounted that other cellular mechanisms are responsible. For example, the phenotypes observed in plants lacking the MUR3 protein may be a consequence of an XyG biosynthesis complex (Chou et al., 2015; Lund et al., 2015) that becomes dysfunctional when no MUR3 protein is present. In this scenario, the mur3-1 and mur3-2 mutants are not cabbage like because the residual MUR3 may still be capable of forming a nondysfunctional XyG biosynthetic complex. However, to be consistent with our data, XLT2, which has 42% amino acid sequence identity with MUR3, must be able to substitute for MUR3 to form a nondysfunctional complex when XLT2 is expressed at sufficiently high levels. XLT2 does not replace MUR3 when expressed at normal levels. This model also requires that the direct effects of the putative dysfunctional biosynthetic complex are suppressed by eliminating the XXT2 or the XXT5 protein in mur3-3 or mur3-7 plants. The xxt2 mur3-3 and xxt5 mur3-3 double mutants have near wild-type morphology and produce xyloglucan with less than 50% unsubstituted XXXG. Models that invoke a dysfunctional biosynthetic complex as the direct cause of the mur3-3 phenotypes are thus complicated by several difficult-to-reconcile requirements.CONCLUSION We have shown that Arabidopsis mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated Xyl than wild-type xyloglucan. This xyloglucan structure is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that exhibit numerous growth defects. Near-normal growth is restored by eliminating the xyloglucan altogether or by increasing the extent of its galactosylation. The altered growth of the mur3 family of mutants and their responses to temperature, pathogens (Tedman-Jones et al., 2008), and salt stress (Li et al., 2013) reveal how modifying one element of a biochemical network, in this case, xyloglucan biosynthesis, may disturb diverse cellular and physiological processes. Such data provide additional evidence in support of the notion that altering wall structure affects numerous aspects of plant life (Seifert and Blaukopf, 2010). Thus, the mur3 mutants provide a unique opportunity to increase our understanding of how changes in cell wall biosynthesis and structure affect plant growth and development as well as disease resistance and responses to environmental stimuli.MATERIALS AND METHODS All primers used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table S3. Plant Lines Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were in the Columbia (Col-0) background. Col-0, mur3-3 (At2g20370; Salk_141953), mur3-7 (SALK_127057), xxt1 (At3g62720; SAIL_785_E02), xxt2-1 (At4g02500; SALK_101308), and xxt2-2 (SALK_150920) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (www.arabidopsis.org). Homozygous plants were identified by PCR. mur3-1 and mur3-2 were from a mutant collection described previously (Reiter et al., 1997). xxt5 (Zabotina et al., 2008) and xxt1 xxt2 (Cavalier et al., 2008) mutant seeds were obtained from Olga Zabotina (Iowa State University, Ames) and Kenneth Keegstra (Michigan State University, East Lansing), respectively. xlt2 mur3-1 mutant (Jensen et al., 2012) seeds were obtained from Marcus Pauly (University of California, Berkeley).Plant Growth Plants were grown in controlled-environmental growth chambers (Adaptis 2000, Conviron). Seeds were germinated and grown on Fafard 3B potting soil at 19°C and 15°C with a 14-h-light and 10-h-dark cycle, respectively, with a light intensity of 120 µmol quanta m−2 s−1 and 70% relative humidity. In a second series of experiments, wild-type and mutant seeds were germinated and grown for 10 d on Fafard 3B potting soil at 19°C and 15°C with a 14-h-light and 10-h-dark cycle, respectively. One-half of the plants was then transferred to a second controlled environmental growth cabinet operated at 28°C and 24°C with a 14-h-light and 10-h-dark cycle, respectively. Images of plants were obtained using a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 digital camera. All image manipulations were performed using Adobe Photoshop CS4 software.Double and Triple Mutant Generation The xxt1 xxt2-1 double mutant was crossed with the mur3-3 mutant. Segregating progenies homozygous for xxt1 mur3-3, xxt2-1 mur3-3, and xxt1 xxt2 mur3-3 were identified in the subsequent F2 and F3 generations. Double mutants were generated by crossing mur3-3 or mur3-7 with xxt1, xxt2-1, xxt2-2, or xxt5. Allele-specific primers for each line were used to identify homozygous mutant alleles by PCR.RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated from the leaves of wild-type and mutant plants using an RNeasy plant mini kit with an on-column DNase I treatment to remove contaminating genomic DNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), and one-twentieth of the first-strand complementary DNA was used for PCR amplification with gene-specific primers. Actin-2 was used as an internal control with primers to amplify a complementary DNA fragment.Plasmid Construction and Plant Transformation The full-length XLT2 open reading frame was PCR amplified with primers XLT2-OE F and XLT2-OE R and then inserted downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in the pCam35tl:egfps2#4 vector (Pattathil et al., 2005). The construct was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101, which was then used to transform the mur3-3 mutant using a floral dip procedure (Clough and Bent, 1998). Transgenic plants were selected by growth on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium containing hygromycin (15 mg L−1). The presence of the transgene was confirmed by PCR using the gene-specific primer XLT2 F paired with vector-specific primer P1300 R.Preparation of the Alcohol-Insoluble Residues and Solubilization of Xyloglucan Cell walls from the aerial portions of wild-type and mutant plants were prepared as their alcohol-insoluble residues (AIRs). The tissues were homogenized in aqueous 80% (v/v) ethanol using a Polytron blender (Kinematica). The suspension was centrifuged and the insoluble residue washed with absolute ethanol and acetone and then vacuum dried at room temperature. The AIR (0.5–1.0 g) was then treated sequentially for 16 h at room temperature with 50 mm ammonium oxalate (50 mL), 1 n KOH containing 0.5% (w/v) sodium borohydride, and then with 4 n KOH containing 0.5% (w/v) sodium borohydride. The 4 n KOH extract, which contains most of the xyloglucan, was adjusted to pH 5 with glacial acetic acid, dialyzed against several changes of deionized water, and freeze dried.Structural Characterization of Xyloglucan Oligosaccharides Xyloglucan oligosaccharides were generated by treating suspensions of the AIR and solutions of the 4 n KOH-soluble materials in 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 5, with an XEG as described (Pauly et al., 1999). Ethanol was added to 70% (v/v) and the mixture kept for 24 h at 4°C. The precipitate that formed was removed by centrifugation and the soluble fraction concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 500 μL of water and then freeze dried to remove residual ammonium formate. Positive-ion MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker Microflex LT mass spectrometer and workstation. Solutions (5 μL) of the oligosaccharides (approximately 1 mg mL−1 in water) were mixed with an equal volume of 10 mm NaCl. A portion of this mixture (1 μL) was then added to a matrix solution (0.1 m 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in aqueous 50% [v/v] acetonitrile, 1 μL) on the stainless steel MALDI target plate and concentrated to dryness using a flow of warm air from a hair dryer. Spectra from at least 200 laser shots were summed up to generate each mass spectrum. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Inova NMR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) operating at 600 MHz using a 3-mm cold probe and a sample temperature of 25°C. XyGOs (0.5–1 mg) were dissolved in D2O (0.7 mL, 99.9% [v/v]; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). All two-dimensional spectra were recorded using standard Varian pulse programs. Chemical shifts were measured relative to internal acetone (δ 2.225). Data were processed using MestReNova software (Universidad de Santiago de Compostela).Xyloglucan Quantification The amounts of xyloglucan present in the AIR were determined by measuring the amounts of isoprimeverose released by Driselase treatment of the AIR (Fry, 1982). Suspensions of the AIR (approximately 1 g) from mutant and wild-type plants in aqueous 80% (v/v) ethanol (100 mL) were ball milled for 16 h at 4°C and 90 rpm in ceramic milling jars (0.3 L) containing a mixture of one-fourth- and one-half-inch zirconia milling beads (U.S. Stoneware). The milled AIR was collected by centrifugation, washed with absolute ethanol and then with acetone, and then vacuum dried at room temperature. Suspensions of the milled AIR (250–500 mg) in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2 (30 mL), were then treated for 24 h at 45°C with Spirizyme (30 μL, Novozymes A/S) and Liquizyme (150 μL, Novozymes A/S) to remove starch. The destarched AIR was collected by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and freeze dried. Triplicate suspensions of the AIR (6.25 mg) in 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.7 (500 μL), containing 0.5% (w/v) chlorobutanol were treated for 24 h at 22°C with 0.25% (w/v) Driselase (100 μL, Sigma-Aldrich) prepared as described (Fry, 1982). A second portion of Driselase (50 μL) was added and the suspension kept for a further 24 h at 22°C. Ethanol (1.5 mL) was added and the mixture kept at 4°C overnight. The suspension was centrifuged and the soluble fraction concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in water (1 mL) and freeze dried to remove residual ammonium formate. The residue was dissolved in water (1 mL), and a portion (250 μL) was filtered using a 0.45-μm centrifugal microfilter. Portions (10 μL) of the soluble material were then analyzed using a Dionex ICS-3000 HPAEC system with pulsed amperometric detection and a CarboPac PA1 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Thermo Fisher). The column was eluted at 1.0 mL min−1 for 5 min with 0.1 n NaOH, then with a gradient of sodium acetate (0–100 mm) in 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min. The column was washed for 15 min with 1 m sodium acetate in 0.1 n NaOH and then reequilibrated for 15 min in 0.1 n NaOH. The chromatography system was calibrated using known amounts of isoprimeverose (Megazyme).Xyloglucan Subunit Composition Analysis Using HPAEC with Pulsed Amperometric Detection Solutions (10 μL) of XyGOs in water (approximately 200 μg mL−1) released by XEG treatment of AIR or the 4 n KOH-soluble materials were analyzed using a Dionex ICS-3000 system and CarboPac PA1 column (250 × 4.6 mm; Thermo Fisher). The column was eluted at 1.0 mL min−1 for 3 min with 0.1 n NaOH, from 3 to 5 min with a gradient of sodium acetate (0–40 mm) in 0.1 n NaOH and from 5 to 38 min with a gradient of sodium acetate (40–100 mm) in 0.1 n NaOH. The column was washed with 1 m sodium acetate in 0.1 n NaOH for 7 min and reequilibrated for 15 min in 0.1 n NaOH. The column was calibrated using known amounts (0.5–2 μg injected) of homogeneous XXXG, XXLG, XLXG, XXFG, XLLG, and XLFG purified from XEG digests of tamarind and sycamore cell wall xyloglucan (Tuomivaara et al., 2015).Glycome Profiling of Plant Cell Wall Extracts AIR generated from wild-type and mutant plants (approximately 500 mg) was treated sequentially with α-amylase, endopolygalacturonase, 50 mm sodium carbonate, 1 n KOH, 4 n KOH, and 5 n KOH containing 3% (w/v) boric acid to generate fractions enriched in pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides. The soluble extracts were adjusted to pH 5 if required, dialyzed (3,500 Mr cutoff) against deionized water, and freeze dried. Solutions (50 µL) of each wall extract (60 µg total sugar mL−1 water) were then used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using monoclonal antibodies that recognize xyloglucan epitopes (see Supplemental Table S4) as described (Pattathil et al., 2010).Confocal Imaging of Endomembrane Organization Col-0, mur3-3, xxt1 mur3-3, xxt2-1 mur3-3, and xxt5 mur3-3 plants were individually transformed with the SP-2SC-GFP construct (Mitsuhashi et al., 2000; Tamura et al., 2005). Transgenic plants were obtained by screening the seeds on kanamycin plates. Epidermal cells of 14-d-old cotyledons were analyzed using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM510 META, Zeiss) as described (Faso et al., 2009).Light Microscopy Leaves from 4-week-old soil-grown Col-0, mur3-3, xxt1 xxt2, and xxt1 xxt2 mur3-3 plants and hypocotyls from Col-0, mur3-1, mur3-2, mur3-3, and mur3-3:35SproMUR3 seedlings grown for 4 d under constant light at 22°C were fixed for 3 h in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1, containing 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. The fixed leaves and hypocotyls were processed for light microscopy as described previously (Avci et al., 2012).Immunocytochemistry Hypocotyl cross sections approximately 3 to 4 mm away from the shoot meristem and leaf cross sections (250 nm thick) approximately 3 to 4 mm away from the leaf tip were mounted on ColorFrost Plus glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and blocked for 30 min with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.1, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 3% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Hypocotyl and leaf cross sections were processed for immunolabeling with monoclonal antibodies CCRC-M1, CCRC-M38, or CCRC-M88 as described (Avci et al., 2012).Supplemental Data The following supplemental materials are available.

    "abstract": "Abstract To overcome endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ER-localized stress sensors actuate distinct downstream organelle-nucleus signaling pathways to invoke a cytoprotective response, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compared to yeast and metazoans, plant UPR studies are more recent but nevertheless fascinating. Here we discuss recent discoveries in plant UPR, highlight conserved and unique features of the plant UPR as well as critical yet-open questions whose answers will likely make significant contributions to the understanding plant ER stress management.",
    "introduction": "Introduction In growth and stress situations, cell homeostasis depends on the functional integrity of the major biosynthetic organelle, the ER, which synthesizes one third of the cellular proteome and essential lipids, and assembles complex-protein associated carbohydrates. When the cell's biosynthetic demands overcome the ER biosynthetic capacity, a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress, is initiated. In multicellular eukaryotes if the UPR fails, ER stress-induced apoptosis occurs. Along eukaryotic lineages, specialized sensors have evolved to manage the UPR and control life-or-death outcomes in ER-stress conditions [1,2]. For ER-stress protection, yeast relies exclusively on the ER-associated ribonuclease and kinase IRE1. Plants and metazoans have evolved a complex signaling network based on membrane-tethered transcription factors (MTTFs) (Box 1), some of which are plant-specific (Figure 1). In metazoans, the ER-associated PERK also operates in UPR signaling (Box 1). Although PERK-like activity has been detected is plants [3], plant PERK-like proteins have not been identified yet (Box 1). Box 1. Multicellular UPR signaling strategy in multicellular eukaryotes. Membrane-tethered bZIP TFs In response to ER stress in metazoans, the ER membrane-tethered activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) moves to the Golgi where the site 1 and site 2 proteases (S1P, S2P) release the TF domain from the membrane anchor. This process is followed by nuclear translocation of the TF domain to modulate gene transcription. The Arabidopsis genome encodes functional homologs of ATF6: AtbZIP28 [44,45] and AtbZIP17 [40]. Functional equivalent TFs have been reported in other plant species [7,46]. The mechanisms of activation of AtbZIP28 are similar to those of ATF6 with COPII-dependent ER-to-Golgi translocation [47] and subsequent activation through proteolysis at the Golgi by S1P [48] and S2P [38], which recognize cleavage sites in the lumenal face and in the transmembrane domain of AtbZIP28, respectively [47,48]. Activation of AtbZIP17 relies on S2P [38], but reliance on S1P is yet unknown.PERK In metazoans, the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) attenuates general translation but favors selective translation of the ATF4 TF through selective phosphorylation of the eukaryotic elongation factor eIF2α [2,49]. In plants a functional homologue of PERK has not been identified yet, despite the evidence that a PERK-like phosphorylation of transcription initiation factors (eIF) occurs in ER stress. AteIF2α hyper-phosphorylation occurs in a loss-of-function mutant background of the Arabidopsis SPIKE1 (SPK1), a DOCK family GEF involved in cell morphogenesis [3,50]. Intriguingly, spk1 has constitutively elevated expression levels of UPR target genes, and shows hypersensitivity to tunicamycin [3]. The evidence that simultaneous loss of AtIRE1 and AtbZIP28 is lethal at embryonic level [18] supports that if PERK-like proteins were involved in the UPR in plant cells, they would likely function in specific stress situations. Yet it cannot be excluded that the kinase activity of AtIRE1, which has been experimentally validated [18], may be responsible for the observed AteIF2α hyper-phosphorylation. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic analysis of IRE1-like proteins and AtbZIP60-like transcripts from different plant species, yeast and human. (a) Phylogenic tree analysis of IRE1-like proteins from Plantae (eudicots and monocots), Metazoa (Homo sapiens) and Fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was generated with MEGA6 program with 1000 replicates in the bootstrap test [51] using the neighbor-joining method [52]. The IRE1-like amino acid sequences were collected from  database. Branch length is not to scale. (b) Phylogenic tree analysis of AtbZIP60-like transcripts from Plantae (dicots and monocots), Metazoan (Homo sapiens) and Fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was generated with MEGA6 program with 1000 replicates in the bootstrap test [51] using the neighbor-joining method [52]. The AtbZIP60-like transcripts were collected from  database. Branch length is not to scale. How the sensors input stress to modulate an effective output in life-or-death decisions is largely unknown, especially in plants. Here we discuss plant UPR strategies that recent exciting results have brought to light in support of convergence of signaling strategies among multicellular eukaryotes as well as plant-specific features of the UPR. Diversification of IRE1 signaling in the UPR: activation of a transcription factor Plants encode one or more IRE1 isoforms (Figure 1a). IRE1-mediated splicing of a transcription factor (TF) mRNA is a conserved strategy for UPR gene regulation (Figure 2). Among eukaryotes the IRE1-TF targets are members of the large bZIP-TF family: Hac1 in yeast and Xbp1 in metazoans. In flowering plants, AtbZIP60, Osb-ZIP74/50 and ZmbZIP60 are the targets identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (dicot), Oryza sativa and Zea mays (monocots), respectively [4–9] (Figure 1b). The consensus mRNA structure that is recognized by IRE1 (i.e. twin-stem loops with conserved bases in each loop) is largely conserved across eukaryotes. The excised intron sequence is slightly different among monocots but conserved in dicots [8]. However, there are noticeable differences in the splicing output among eukaryotes. In plants, the IRE1-mediated mRNA splicing causes an intron-excising frameshift that occurs closely upstream of the region encoding a putative transmembrane domain and leads to elimination of the membrane anchor in the translated active TF [4,7,8]. In metazoans, the IRE1-spliced Xbp1 loses the ER membrane anchor and gains the TF domain located in the new C-terminal tail [10,11]. In yeast, the splicing of Hac1 mRNA is followed by transcriptional joint of the DNA-binding domain to the newly encoded TF transcription activation domain [12]. The lack of a close conservation of the sequence of the mature TFs and the diversification of the splicing outputs among eukaryotes support that, despite IRE1 being an ancient sensor, IRE1-TF targets may have evolved independently. Under this light, the notion that Hac1 and Xbp1 are the sole direct TF targets of IRE1 may not apply in plants where IRE1 may have other direct TF targets that may fine-tune IRE1 signaling in the UPR management in specific stress situations. This possibility is predicated by the evidence that even in the simultaneous absence of the Arabidopsis ER-stress activated TFs (AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP60), one of the major UPR gene markers, AtBiP3 is mildly induced in conditions of ER stress [13••]. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Players of the plant UPR known to date. The diagram illustrates that in addition to IRE1, bZIP28 and bZIP60, also bZIP17 plays a role in the control of UPR target genes in Arabidopsis, as recently proposed [27]. A role for the beta subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex, AGB1, in modulating the UPR has also been reported [17••,53]. Furthermore, recent work has shown that NAC TFs participate to the plant UPR. NAC are plant-specific transcription factors, among which at least 13 members are predicted to be membrane-anchored in Arabidopsis. In condition of stress, the plasma membrane NAC062/ANAC062/NTL6 relocates to the nucleus, and the overexpression of a protein deletion devoid of the membrane anchor leads to activation of UPR genes [54••]. Another membrane-anchored NAC TF, NAC089, participates to ER stress responses by relocating from the ER to the nucleus and regulating PCD-related gene expression [55•]. NAC089 expression is regulated by bZIP28 and bZIP60; bZIP60 also regulates directly the expression of NAC062. Finally the cytosolic NAC103, whose expression is directly regulated by bZIP60, is involved in controlling UPR gene expression [26•]. The evidence that plant-specific NAC TFs have a role in stress responses support that in addition to common routes plants have evolved unique strategies for ER stress defense that, as in the case of NAC062, may also depend on the activity of TFs that are localized to the membrane organelles other than the ER. Interestingly also, it has been recently suggested that unspliced AtbZIP60 may have a role in modulating the expression of BiP3 in conditions of ER stress [27]. Phosphorylation of the elf2α may occur in a hypothetical PERK-like pathway for ER stress responses. See also the main text for additional details. TFD: transcription factor domain Diversification of IRE1 signaling in the UPR: RIDD In addition to TF-mRNA splicing, metazoan IRE1 degrades mRNAs through a site-specific cleavage process, known as regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) [14], which is uncoupled from the site-specific splicing activity of IRE1 [15]. RIDD activity is required for ER homeostasis in non ER-stress conditions and increases progressively with ER-stress intensity. RIDD also occurs in Arabidopsis [16••], but its physiological relevance without ER-stress induction is yet to be defined [16••]. In normal conditions of growth, loss of AtIRE1 function causes defects in root elongation [17••], independently of Atb-ZIP60 [18••]. It is possible therefore that in the absence of induced ER stress RIDD may be important to maintain growth homeostasis in specific plant organs by controlling the levels of mRNA of proteins involved in cell growth. Diversification of IRE1 signaling in the UPR: miRNA cleavage In mammalian cells, IRE1 also cleaves sequences of specific miRNAs [19]. miRNAs operate to translationally repress gene expression [20]. Whether plant IRE1 has a similar control of miRNA levels is yet unknown. Selective miRNA cleavage could be a strategy to either overcome stress, modulate tissue growth, or both. Addressing this question may lead to new insights into the functions of plant IRE1, and to establishing whether IRE1 activity is conserved among eukaryotes. Indeed the findings that loss of IRE1 is lethal in conditions of prolonged ER stress support a function as ER-stress protector [17••]. The recent evidence that the mammalian IRE1 may not activate caspases to induce cell death in prolonged ER stress, contrarily to a previous notion [19], but rather delay the onset of apoptosis via decay of the pro-apoptotic Death Receptor 5 (DR5) [21], poses that plant and animal IRE1s may be functionally close in protecting the organism from death. How may multiple IRE1 help plants in stress defense? An intriguing question relates to the diversification of the ER-stress sensors in plants both qualitatively and quantitatively. In Arabidopsis there are two IRE1 isoforms, AtIRE1a and AtIRE1b [22]. Whether IRE1 isoforms may be functionally equivalent is a matter of debate. Both genes are expressed throughout the plant, but AtIRE1a is more abundant in embryos and seeds [22,23]. It has been proposed that unlikely AtIRE1a, AtIRE1b is relevant to AtbZIP60 splicing in conditions of DTT-induced stress [4], supporting the possibility of functional diversification of AtIRE1 proteins. This is further reinforced by the observations that while AtIRE1b has a preponderant role in AtbZIP60 splicing upon tunicamycin-induced ER-stress, AtIRE1a seems preferentially required for AtbZIP60 splicing upon pathogen and salicylic acid (SA) infection [5]. Although functional diversification of the SA response has been recently questioned [24], the evidence that AtIRE1b but not AtIRE1a is required for AtbZIP60 splicing [4] supports that AtIRE1 proteins may have undergone functional specialization. These observations raise the question how the multiple IRE1-functions may be executed in species with one IRE1 isoform. The observation that in Arabidopsis AtIRE1b but not AtbZIP60 is required for ER stress-induced autophagy [25••] hints to the possibility that, in species containing only one IRE1 gene, some of the IRE1-roles may be executed by other proteins. Nonetheless the evidence in Arabidopsis that in induced-stress conditions, unlike a double atire1a/atire1b mutant, single IRE1 loss-of-function mutants survive prolonged ER stress supports that at least the pro-survival role of AtIRE1 is shared by the two proteins. Whether the roles of the IRE1 isoforms are spatially and/or temporally regulated is yet to be established. It is possible that in certain tissues IRE1 may have a specific relevance and other ER stress sensors might operate predominately in other tissues. How may multiple bZIPs help plants in stress defense? Loss of either AtbZIP60 or AtbZIP28 (Box 1) attenuates the expression of some common transcriptional targets such as BiP3 and calnexin, an effect that is additive when both genes are simultaneously deleted [26•]. This evidence supports overlapping functions of these two TFs for which a precise extent of overlap is yet to be completely understood both at a temporal resolution as well as target identity. Specifically, it is yet to be defined whether at the onset of ER stress, activation of AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP60 occurs simultaneously or sequentially. One may predict that mild stress might be resolved by the function of one of the two TFs and that the activation of the other TF may be actuated in situations of unresolved ER stress to potentiate an ER stress-mitigating response. It is also known however that activation of bZIP-TFs may lead to responses that are qualitatively distinct. For example, in conditions of salt stress, AtbZIP17 modulates only the expression of BiP3 among the known ER stress markers [27], which, on the other hand, is controlled by both AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP60 in conditions of ER stress induced by heat or by drugs such as tunicamycin and DTT. Furthermore, heat, tunicamycin and DTT but not salt stress can induce activation of AtbZIP60 and AtbZIP28, and a role of AtIRE1-AtbZIP60 but not AtbZIP28 has been demonstrated in virus-plant interactions [28]. These findings support that plant stress response relies on functional specialization of the UPR effectors for which the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this view the UPR sensors might be specialized in perceiving specific classes of unfolded proteins, which may be more sensitive than others to specific stresses. Requirements for the UPR sensors In yeast and metazoans, a model has emerged that the binding of unfolded proteins to IRE1 dimers allows further oligomerization and trigger the IRE1 activation, while the BiP binding to IRE1 may have a modulatory role in buffering the pool of IRE1 monomers [2,29]. In plants the mechanisms of activation of IRE1 are largely unknown. Nonetheless, binding to AtBiP is a mechanism that constrains AtbZIP28 to the ER and therefore modulates AtbZIP28 traffic to the Golgi for activation [30]. Such a mechanism, which is similar to the activation mechanism of ATF6 [31] could suggest also conservation of IRE1 activation. Similarly, AtbZIP17 may be retained in the ER via interactions with other proteins that specifically respond to salt stress. One alternative that cannot be excluded is that one branch of the UPR may be activated as consequence to the operation of another ER-stress response, such as production of radicals or unfolded proteins, which could lead to the activation of other ER stress defenses. Interaction with unfolded proteins might not be the only upstream requirement for plant IRE1 activation. Functional and genetic evidence have shown that the ER-shaping protein AtRHD3 is a critical factor that acts upstream of AtIRE1 in the AtbZIP60 splicing in conditions of ER stress [32•], but the underlying causes are not known. In conditions of ER stress yeast and metazoan IRE1s are known to cluster in ER subdomains where stress signaling is believed to occur [2]. In the absence of induced ER stress, fluorescent protein fusions to plant IRE1s have been localized to the perinuclear ER [22]. It is possible that, if plant IRE1 is also mobilized into signaling clusters in ER-stress conditions, then alteration of the ER network structure or lipid composition, known to occur with RHD3 deletions [33,34], may affect mobilization of plant IRE1 into signaling hubs. Besides factors acting upstream the UPR sensors in plants, we know very little about downstream regulating factors. Unlike metazoan IRE1, which is known to interact with multiple proteins which may or may not regulate its function [35], the identity of plant IRE1-interacting proteins is still unknown. The situation is markedly different for the bZIP-TFs. In vitro AtbZIP28 can homodimerize but also heterodimerize with AtbZIP60, Atb-ZIP49 or AtbZIP17 [36]. Validation of these findings in vivo coupled with functional analyses may provide insights into the relevance of the TF interactions in the UPR. AtbZIP28 has also been found to interact with NF-Y subunits to form a transcriptional complex that upregulates the expression of ER stress-induced genes [36]. Furthermore, AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP60 interact with AtAsh2 and AtWDR5a, which are core components of the COMPASS-like complex that regulates gene expression through histone H3K4 trimethylation [13••]. These findings support that the protein-protein interactions of the UPR bZIP-TFs may have important roles in the regulation of gene expression and that a diversification of such interactions may be needed to modulate responsive outputs that are different both at quantitative and qualitative levels. One critical yet unanswered question is how the activated sensors are restored to basal levels once the ER stress is resolved. In other words, how is the plant UPR tamed once ER homeostasis is obtained?",

Copyright notice ID: 4618186 MSID: MS707589 PMID: 26149756 The publisher's version of this article is available at Curr Opin Plant Biol Abstract To overcome endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ER-localized stress sensors actuate distinct downstream organelle-nucleus signaling pathways to invoke a cytoprotective response, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compared to yeast and metazoans, plant UPR studies are more recent but nevertheless fascinating. Here we discuss recent discoveries in plant UPR, highlight conserved and unique features of the plant UPR as well as critical yet-open questions whose answers will likely make significant contributions to the understanding plant ER stress management.Introduction In growth and stress situations, cell homeostasis depends on the functional integrity of the major biosynthetic organelle, the ER, which synthesizes one third of the cellular proteome and essential lipids, and assembles complex-protein associated carbohydrates. When the cell's biosynthetic demands overcome the ER biosynthetic capacity, a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress, is initiated. In multicellular eukaryotes if the UPR fails, ER stress-induced apoptosis occurs. Along eukaryotic lineages, specialized sensors have evolved to manage the UPR and control life-or-death outcomes in ER-stress conditions [1,2]. For ER-stress protection, yeast relies exclusively on the ER-associated ribonuclease and kinase IRE1. Plants and metazoans have evolved a complex signaling network based on membrane-tethered transcription factors (MTTFs) (Box 1), some of which are plant-specific (Figure 1). In metazoans, the ER-associated PERK also operates in UPR signaling (Box 1). Although PERK-like activity has been detected is plants [3], plant PERK-like proteins have not been identified yet (Box 1). Box 1. Multicellular UPR signaling strategy in multicellular eukaryotes. Membrane-tethered bZIP TFs In response to ER stress in metazoans, the ER membrane-tethered activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) moves to the Golgi where the site 1 and site 2 proteases (S1P, S2P) release the TF domain from the membrane anchor. This process is followed by nuclear translocation of the TF domain to modulate gene transcription. The Arabidopsis genome encodes functional homologs of ATF6: AtbZIP28 [44,45] and AtbZIP17 [40]. Functional equivalent TFs have been reported in other plant species [7,46]. The mechanisms of activation of AtbZIP28 are similar to those of ATF6 with COPII-dependent ER-to-Golgi translocation [47] and subsequent activation through proteolysis at the Golgi by S1P [48] and S2P [38], which recognize cleavage sites in the lumenal face and in the transmembrane domain of AtbZIP28, respectively [47,48]. Activation of AtbZIP17 relies on S2P [38], but reliance on S1P is yet unknown.PERK In metazoans, the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) attenuates general translation but favors selective translation of the ATF4 TF through selective phosphorylation of the eukaryotic elongation factor eIF2α [2,49]. In plants a functional homologue of PERK has not been identified yet, despite the evidence that a PERK-like phosphorylation of transcription initiation factors (eIF) occurs in ER stress. AteIF2α hyper-phosphorylation occurs in a loss-of-function mutant background of the Arabidopsis SPIKE1 (SPK1), a DOCK family GEF involved in cell morphogenesis [3,50]. Intriguingly, spk1 has constitutively elevated expression levels of UPR target genes, and shows hypersensitivity to tunicamycin [3]. The evidence that simultaneous loss of AtIRE1 and AtbZIP28 is lethal at embryonic level [18] supports that if PERK-like proteins were involved in the UPR in plant cells, they would likely function in specific stress situations. Yet it cannot be excluded that the kinase activity of AtIRE1, which has been experimentally validated [18], may be responsible for the observed AteIF2α hyper-phosphorylation.Figure 1.

The IRE1-like amino acid sequences were collected from  database. Branch length is not to scale.

The AtbZIP60-like transcripts were collected from  database. Branch length is not to scale.How the sensors input stress to modulate an effective output in life-or-death decisions is largely unknown, especially in plants. Here we discuss plant UPR strategies that recent exciting results have brought to light in support of convergence of signaling strategies among multicellular eukaryotes as well as plant-specific features of the UPR. Diversification of IRE1 signaling in the UPR: activation of a transcription factor Plants encode one or more IRE1 isoforms (Figure 1a). IRE1-mediated splicing of a transcription factor (TF) mRNA is a conserved strategy for UPR gene regulation (Figure 2). Among eukaryotes the IRE1-TF targets are members of the large bZIP-TF family: Hac1 in yeast and Xbp1 in metazoans. In flowering plants, AtbZIP60, Osb-ZIP74/50 and ZmbZIP60 are the targets identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (dicot), Oryza sativa and Zea mays (monocots), respectively [4–9] (Figure 1b). The consensus mRNA structure that is recognized by IRE1 (i.e. twin-stem loops with conserved bases in each loop) is largely conserved across eukaryotes. The excised intron sequence is slightly different among monocots but conserved in dicots [8]. However, there are noticeable differences in the splicing output among eukaryotes. In plants, the IRE1-mediated mRNA splicing causes an intron-excising frameshift that occurs closely upstream of the region encoding a putative transmembrane domain and leads to elimination of the membrane anchor in the translated active TF [4,7,8]. In metazoans, the IRE1-spliced Xbp1 loses the ER membrane anchor and gains the TF domain located in the new C-terminal tail [10,11]. In yeast, the splicing of Hac1 mRNA is followed by transcriptional joint of the DNA-binding domain to the newly encoded TF transcription activation domain [12]. The lack of a close conservation of the sequence of the mature TFs and the diversification of the splicing outputs among eukaryotes support that, despite IRE1 being an ancient sensor, IRE1-TF targets may have evolved independently. Under this light, the notion that Hac1 and Xbp1 are the sole direct TF targets of IRE1 may not apply in plants where IRE1 may have other direct TF targets that may fine-tune IRE1 signaling in the UPR management in specific stress situations. This possibility is predicated by the evidence that even in the simultaneous absence of the Arabidopsis ER-stress activated TFs (AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP60), one of the major UPR gene markers, AtBiP3 is mildly induced in conditions of ER stress [13••]. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Players of the plant UPR known to date. The diagram illustrates that in addition to IRE1, bZIP28 and bZIP60, also bZIP17 plays a role in the control of UPR target genes in Arabidopsis, as recently proposed [27]. A role for the beta subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex, AGB1, in modulating the UPR has also been reported [17••,53]. Furthermore, recent work has shown that NAC TFs participate to the plant UPR. NAC are plant-specific transcription factors, among which at least 13 members are predicted to be membrane-anchored in Arabidopsis. In condition of stress, the plasma membrane NAC062/ANAC062/NTL6 relocates to the nucleus, and the overexpression of a protein deletion devoid of the membrane anchor leads to activation of UPR genes [54••]. Another membrane-anchored NAC TF, NAC089, participates to ER stress responses by relocating from the ER to the nucleus and regulating PCD-related gene expression [55•]. NAC089 expression is regulated by bZIP28 and bZIP60; bZIP60 also regulates directly the expression of NAC062. Finally the cytosolic NAC103, whose expression is directly regulated by bZIP60, is involved in controlling UPR gene expression [26•]. The evidence that plant-specific NAC TFs have a role in stress responses support that in addition to common routes plants have evolved unique strategies for ER stress defense that, as in the case of NAC062, may also depend on the activity of TFs that are localized to the membrane organelles other than the ER. Interestingly also, it has been recently suggested that unspliced AtbZIP60 may have a role in modulating the expression of BiP3 in conditions of ER stress [27]. Phosphorylation of the elf2α may occur in a hypothetical PERK-like pathway for ER stress responses. See also the main text for additional details. TFD: transcription factor domainDiversification of IRE1 signaling in the UPR: RIDD In addition to TF-mRNA splicing, metazoan IRE1 degrades mRNAs through a site-specific cleavage process, known as regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) [14], which is uncoupled from the site-specific splicing activity of IRE1 [15]. RIDD activity is required for ER homeostasis in non ER-stress conditions and increases progressively with ER-stress intensity. RIDD also occurs in Arabidopsis [16••], but its physiological relevance without ER-stress induction is yet to be defined [16••]. In normal conditions of growth, loss of AtIRE1 function causes defects in root elongation [17••], independently of Atb-ZIP60 [18••]. It is possible therefore that in the absence of induced ER stress RIDD may be important to maintain growth homeostasis in specific plant organs by controlling the levels of mRNA of proteins involved in cell growth.Diversification of IRE1 signaling in the UPR: miRNA cleavage In mammalian cells, IRE1 also cleaves sequences of specific miRNAs [19]. miRNAs operate to translationally repress gene expression [20]. Whether plant IRE1 has a similar control of miRNA levels is yet unknown. Selective miRNA cleavage could be a strategy to either overcome stress, modulate tissue growth, or both. Addressing this question may lead to new insights into the functions of plant IRE1, and to establishing whether IRE1 activity is conserved among eukaryotes. Indeed the findings that loss of IRE1 is lethal in conditions of prolonged ER stress support a function as ER-stress protector [17••]. The recent evidence that the mammalian IRE1 may not activate caspases to induce cell death in prolonged ER stress, contrarily to a previous notion [19], but rather delay the onset of apoptosis via decay of the pro-apoptotic Death Receptor 5 (DR5) [21], poses that plant and animal IRE1s may be functionally close in protecting the organism from death.How may multiple IRE1 help plants in stress defense?
