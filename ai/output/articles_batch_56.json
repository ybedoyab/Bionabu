    "abstract": "Abstract Background Monitoring the adaptation of microorganisms to the extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is crucial to understanding microbial evolution and infection prevention. Acinetobacter pittii is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen, primarily impacting immunocompromised patients, that was recently isolated from two missions aboard the ISS.Results Here, we report how ISS-associated A. pittii (n = 20 genomes) has formed its own genetically and functionally discrete clade distinct from most Earth-bound isolates (n = 291 genomes). The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ISS strains and two related clinical isolates demonstrated that ISS strains acquired more resistance, specifically with regard to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, despite no prediction of increased resistance based on genomic analysis of resistance genes. By investigating 402 longitudinal environmental and host-associated ISS metagenomes, we observed that viable A. pittii is increasing in relative abundance and therefore potentially exhibiting succession, being identified in >2X more metagenomic samples in back-to-back missions. ISS strains additionally contain functions that enable them to survive in harsh environments, including the transcriptional regulator LexA. Via a genome-wide association study, we identified a high level of mutational burden in methionine sulfoxide reductase genes relative to the most closely related Earth strains.Conclusions Overall, these results indicated a step forward in understanding how microorganisms might evolve and alter their antibiotic resistance phenotype in extreme, resource-limited, human-built environments.

    "introduction": "Introduction Any bacterial species introduced into space will inevitably face the extreme pressures inherent therein (e.g., microgravity and solar radiation). While humans also encounter these challenges during space flight and, indeed, our physiology is impacted by prolonged exposure—microbes possess the unique ability to adapt quickly due to rapid cell division (thereby mutation) and the acquisition of external DNA elements through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [1]. Given the pivotal roles microbes play in human health and physiology (e.g., ranging from pathogens to arbiters of a healthy gut), understanding how we can expect specific microbes to adapt to space-based ecosystems is essential for ensuring crew safety and health during longer space missions. The International Space Station (ISS) is perhaps the paradigm of experimental “built environments” to observe such microbial adaptation in action. After all, all life on the ISS had to originate on Earth, and this makes it the ideal place to study, in a contained environment, how life changes in orbit. To date, there have been numerous other examples of microbes changing after being exposed to space. These include fungal adaptation to the ISS as a function of microgravity and changes in Agrobacterium genome composition, among others [2–4]. Recently, the microbe Acinetobacter pittii was isolated from surfaces within the ISS during two microbial-monitoring missions (referred to as microbial tracking-1 [MT1] and microbial tracking-2 [MT2]) [2, 5]. A. pittii is an opportunistic, Biosafety Level (BSL) 2 pathogen capable of causing potentially fatal infection, most commonly in immunocompromised patients in clinical settings [6, 7]. Bacteremia deriving from A. pittii has been observed as having a 17% 28-day mortality rate [8], though healthy individuals are usually not at risk of infection. Members of the genus Acinetobacter tend to be multi-drug-resistant and more commonly isolated from hospital settings as a result of their ability to resist environmental disinfectants and their potential for aerosolization [9]. In addition, A. pittii has been observed in various built environment settings other than hospitals (e.g., household objects) [10]. Many diverse A. pittii genomes are available from a variety of settings, making it an excellent model for comparative genomics. The presence of a nosocomial BSL-2 pathogen in space warrants investigation in and of itself as the potential for human infection in this extreme environment raises concern; additionally, A. pittii is particularly adept at HGT in a simulated microgravity [1]. This indicates a propensity for rapid adaptation to conditions aboard the ISS and acquiring additional genes that could contribute to antibiotic resistance. As a result, monitoring the biology of A. pittii, and how strains are changing in space, is of high priority. Finally, understanding how an organism, especially a pathogen, is changing and whether it is propagating is critical to our ability to design effective infection prevention strategies. In other words, is it colonizing and spreading via the human body, or is it limited to the environment? Answering this metapangenomic [11] question requires both longitudinal sampling of human (e.g., the oral microbiome) and environmental (e.g., the space station viewports) metagenomes to identify the presence or absence of specific strains in complex microbial communities over time. Here, we jointly used longitudinally collected isolates and metagenomic sequencing to measure changes to A. pittii genomes across time in space. We compared clinical strains isolated on Earth to cultured organisms from the space station and those de novo assembled into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). We described the specific gene and phenotype changes possibly occurring as a function of exposure to space, and we identified where A. pittii is most prevalent across the ISS.",
    "methods": "Methods Downloading and annotating public A. pittii genomes Using the ’s entrez command line, we downloaded every genome annotated as A. pittii ( taxonomic ID48296) from the ’s assembly database. These downloaded genomes included those from the MT1 and MT2 missions as well as others isolated from the ISS. We manually searched the  BioProject, BioSample, and assembly databases for all 319 downloaded A. pittii genomes in order to determine their environment. We manually mapped environmental tables to a consistent set of terms (e.g., converting “endobronchial tube” to “respiratory tract” and searching BioSample for information on isolation sources stored in a non-standard format). The original terms, as well as the mapping therein, is reported in Supplementary Table 1. Phylogenetic annotation and computing SNP distances To confirm the taxonomy of all assembled genomes as well as those downloaded from the , we used GTDB-Tk (V1.6.0), the Genome Taxonomy Database’s accompanying toolkit that uses a variety of dependencies to place genomes into a phylogenetic tree according to a set of globally conserved marker genes [32–38]. Specifically, we sequentially employed GTDB-Tk’s identify, align, and infer functions, all with the default settings in order to taxonomically annotate and build a phylogenetic tree from our downloaded and assembled genomes. We additionally used GTDB-Tk’s resultant taxonomic classification to filter out any  genomes that were not annotated as A. pittii. For Supp Fig. 2, we plotted and annotated the GTDB-Tk phylogenetic tree in R (V4.1.1) using ggtree (V 3.0.4) [39]. For the pairwise SNP distance comparisons in Fig. 1B, we identified a core-SNP set using snippy V4.6.0 (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) for the ISS clade (i.e., all ISS MAGs/genomes and the two comparator Earth-based patient isolates we referenced throughout the study). We ran Snippy with the default settings, and its output was also used with gubbins V3.2.1 [40] and FastTree V2.1.11 [41] (also with default settings as recommended on Snippy’s README) to generate the phylogenetic tree in Supp Fig. 1B. Pangenome construction, functional annotation, and joint variant calling We first identified ORFs with Prokka V1.14.6 [42] using the default parameters. The ab initio functional annotations (i.e., COGs) for each predicted gene sequence were identified as part of Prokka’s automated pipeline, which pulls annotations from a variety of reference databases. To build a pangenome, we used ROARY running the default settings on the Prokka output. We called SNPs and indels jointly across the closely related Earth/ISS strains using SPANDx (V4.0.1) [43] with the default settings. Alternate phylogeny construction We additionally computed phylogenies for Supp Fig. 1A and Fig. 1A using the output of SPANDx (the maximum likelihood tree) and RAXmL (V8.2.12, with the following parameters: -m GTRGAMMA -p 12345), which we ran on the ROARY core alignment output. Association studies We used the presence-absence matrix output of ROARY for the gene-level association study and the filtered VCF output of SPANDx for the SNP/indel association study. We computed associations with pyseer (V1.3.9) [44]. For the gene-level analysis, we adjusted for population stratification with five principal components based on phylogenetic distances generated from the tree in Fig. 1. These distances were computed with pyseer’s built-in scripts. For the mutational analysis, we used pyseer’s mixed modeling approach with similarities built from SPANDx’s maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Accessing metagenomic datasets We downloaded publicly available environmental metagenomic datasets from the MT1 (accession = PRJNA438545), MT2 (accession = PRJNA781277) missions, and genomes of 402 A. pittii isolates of human clinical samples. The microbial sequencing associated with astronaut samples of MT-2 study and NASA Twins study cannot be shared publicly due to Institutional Review Board (IRB). These data are available upon request in NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA) (https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Dataset). Processing and de novo assembly of ISS metagenomic data We first ran a quality control pipeline on all metagenomic samples. We used bbtools (V38.92) functions to clump reads, remove adapter contamination, and remove sequencing error (clumpify [parameters: optical=f, dupesubs=2,dedupe=t], bbduk [parameters: qout=33 trd=t hdist=1 k=27 ktrim=\"r\" mink=8 overwrite=true trimq=10 qtrim='rl' threads=10 minlength=51 maxns=-1 minbasefrequency=0.05 ecco=f], and tadpole [parameters: mode=correct, ecc=t, ecco=t]) [45]. Where necessary, we would remove unmatching reads using bbtool’s repair function (default parameters). We additionally used bowtie2 (parameters: --very-sensitive-local) to align to the human reference genome (GRCh38) [46]. We de novo assembled all metagenomic reads into contigs using metaSPAdes [47] (default settings). Constructing metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) We constructed MAGs from all metagenomic samples using an approach modeled after the literature [48]. We used bbmap [45] to align quality-controlled reads from each sample to its respective contigs resulting from the assembly. We used the alignment output with the default settings, as well as the contigs themselves, as input into MetaWRAP V1.3 (which calls metaBAT2, Maxbin2, and CONCOCT) to generate MAGs [49–52]. For each sample, we used dRep V3.2.2 [53] (parameters: -p 15 -comp 50 -pa 0.9 -sa 0.95 -nc 0.30 -cm larger) to estimate the quality of each genome and to remove redundant genome bins. We did not dereplicate genomes across samples to avoid combining distinct A. pittii strains. The quality of both A. pittii bins can be found in Supp Table 1. We classified the taxonomy of each within-sample non-redundant bin with GTDB-Tk in the same manner as for the isolate genomes. Analysis of CARD genes within isolate and bin genomes We used RGI (main) V5.2.1 running the default settings to identify antibiotic resistance genes and markers in the isolate genomes and metagenomic bins. Identifying A. pittii in metagenomic samples We used Kraken2 and Bracken (running the default settings) to estimate the abundance of A. pittii in each of our quality-controlled metagenomes [54, 55]. To search for the abundance of the specific MT1/MT2 cultured isolates and the metagenome-assembled genomes, we aligned the raw reads of each metagenome against the contigs for a given genome. We counted the number of reads aligning to a genome and, to adjust for depth of sequencing, divided by the number of read mate-pairs in each sample. As a point of comparison, we additionally included the high-quality, assembled genome of recently isolated A. pittii type ( assembly ID = GCA_000369045, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN01828154/), referred to as a type strain in this analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) Susceptibility testing using standard antibiotics was performed by broth microdilution with MicroScan Gram-negative NM56 trays (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were used as control strains as recommended in CLSI methods. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were interpreted according to the 2021 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for Acinetobacter species [56].",
    "results": "Results A. pittii isolated from the ISS have become phylogenetically distinct from Earth-bound strains We built a dataset comprising publicly available assembled genomes, metagenomic bins, and assembled, not-yet-public genomes that our team had sequenced from the ISS (Table 1). We downloaded 319 genomes annotated as A. pittii from the ’s (’s) assembly database. Five of these were isolated from the ISS mission MT1 (flight 2), whereas 15 were from MT2 (flight 8) [12, 13]. The MT1/MT2 isolations were performed with similar swabbing and dilution protocols. We ran the genomes through GTDB-tK to confirm their taxonomy, removing eight from analysis due to their being annotated as other species (e.g., Acinetobacter baumannii). Table 1.

These samples comprised 42 from environmental sites on the MT1 mission, 60 from environmental sites on the MT2 mission, 246 from different crew body sites on the MT2 mission, and 54 from the crew of the NASA Twins Study, which took place prior to the MT1/MT2 missions [5, 14]. We annotated only two MAGs as A. pittii using GTDB-tK. Both genomes were >99% complete, had <1% contamination, and were from environmental samples from the MT1 mission (samples SRR6853346 and SRR6853362, both from flight 2). These brought the total number of A. pittii genomes (including MAGs and isolates) carried forward for the rest of the analysis to 313 (Table 1, Supp Table 1). We then built phylogenetic trees (with four different approaches ranging from marker-gene-based to SNP-based) for the resultant strains of A. pittii isolated from or identified on the ISS versus those from different Earth environments (Fig. 1, Supp Figs. 1 and 2). We identified that ISS A. pittii isolates formed a distinct clade from strains associated with all other ecosystems. Across all trees, only two strains, both isolated from infected patients, from Earth additionally fell in this clade. Given their placement, we focused specifically on grounding our proximal functional, antimicrobial, and genetic analysis of the ISS strains in comparison to these two strains (referred to as PR-313 and PR-429). By comparison, isolates from other ecosystems (e.g., human blood, wastewater) did not cluster together based on phylogeny to the same level as those from the ISS, and, overall, other A. pittii from the environmental ecosystems were phylogenetically distinct from the ISS strains. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab A. pittii from the ISS as compared to publicly available genomes. A A phylogenetic tree displaying the “ISS clade” (red box), which contains all ISS genomes as well as 3 Earth-derived strains. The right panel is a zoomed-in image on the upper portion of the tree. B SNP level similarity of the ISS isolates and two closely related Earth strains as well as a related patient isolate, referred to as “type strain.” Names in the gray bar are the identity of the reference genome to which all others on the x-axes were compared. P values were generated from Wilcox tests. CSF refers to cerebrospinal fluidWe additionally compared PR-313, PR-429, and the assembly of the A. pittii type strain (GenBank accession GCA_000369045.1, ATCC 19004, acquired from a patient blood sample) to the ISS isolates (not including the MAGs) at the SNP-level (Fig. 1B). ISS A. pittii strains differed from the type strain by an average of 52,546 SNPs. They differed from PR-313 and PR-429 by 899 and 1040 SNPs on average, respectively. The MT2 isolates had more SNPs relative to all three references than the MT1 isolates (p < 0.001). A. pittii’s potential succession through the built environment of the ISS Next, we aimed to determine the source and observe the potential succession of A. pittii on the ISS based on shifts in relative abundance (as opposed to absolute abundance), which is an approach we have taken in prior work [15]. In the same shotgun sequenced samples from which we identified our metagenomic bins, we computed the abundance of A. pittii using Kraken2. We stratified this analysis by metagenomes that had, versus had not, been treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to remove non-viable cells. We noted the potential succession of viable A. pittii throughout the environment of the ISS (Fig. 2A). We identified more reads mapping to A. pittii in the environmental samples than in the human samples, and its relative abundance was higher in PMA-treated environmental metagenomes (p = 0.0063) in the MT2 mission. Overall, its abundance increased between the two missions (p < 0.001). The majority of A. pittii abundance during the MT1 flight was in a small number of samples. One environmental metagenome from the MT1 mission had extremely high levels of A. pittii abundance (SRR6853346, relative abundance = 52.1%). This and the MT1 sample with the second-highest abundance (SRR6853362, relative abundance = 12.8%) were the ones we were able to assemble MAGs from, and they were taken from the port panel next to Cupola node 3 on the ISS. The median relative abundance of A. pittii (0.02%) during the MT2 mission was the highest by an order of magnitude compared to the other metagenomic sources. Further, short reads mapped to A. pittii with Kraken2 were identified in more locations across the ISS in MT2 than in MT1 (19/42 [45.2%] metagenomes in MT1 vs. 48/60 [80%] in MT2). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab The distribution and potential succession of A. pittii aboard the ISS. All p values are derived from Wilcox tests.

The x-axis indicates the source of the metagenomes, with “pool” referring to combined samples across sites. B The percent genome coverage with at least 3 reads aligning to each of the two A. pittii metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) identified in our analysis. C The proportion of reads aligning to each of these MAGs from environmental metagenomes. D The abundance of A. pittii strains as a function of specific flights. The proportion of reads aligning to MAGs broken down by each flight in the MT1 and MT2 missions. P values in this panel correspond to the change in abundance between the first and last flights (top) and the different missions (bottom)To further explore the spread of A. pittii throughout the ISS, we next searched specifically for the presence of the two MAGs we identified previously in all the environmental metagenomic samples in our dataset. We computed the fraction of raw reads in each metagenome aligning back to the MAGs (Fig. 2B, C). We observed a statistically significant (p < 0.001) increase in both the coverage and relative abundance of the genomes. Metagenomes treated with PMA had higher coverage (p < 0.05) in both missions. To gain an even higher-resolution view into the potential succession of A. pittii aboard the ISS, we broke down its shifts in abundance as a function of flight. The MT1 mission consisted of three longitudinal flights (i.e., time points), whereas the MT2 consisted of four, with increasing average abundance from flight one to seven in A. pittii MAGs (Fig. 2D). Changes in abundance between flights 1 and 7 were statistically significant (p < 0.001), as well as between flights 3 and 4 (the gap between the missions). ISS-associated A. pittii are becoming functionally distinct from Earth-bound strains We next aimed to determine how the ISS A. pittii varied genetically and functionally compared to its Earth counterparts. We identified and functionally annotated all the Open-Reading-Frames (ORFs, which refer to the coding sequences of a microbial genome) in each of the 313 genomes/MAGs. In total, we identified 1,188,894 genes and 1459 distinct Clusters of Orthologous Gene (COG) annotations (Supp Table 2). Initially, we sought to identify similarities and differences in COGs annotated to ORFs present in five different genome “types”: the genomes of the MT1 and MT2 isolates, the MAGs, the type strain, and the two human isolates that were consistently grouped in the ISS clade (as described in Fig. 1). Nineteen COGs were present in all genome types except the type strain. These included two transketolases, a type II secretion mechanism (PulG), a sulfoxide reductase and sulfatase maturation enzyme, an alcohol dehydrogenase, a curcumin reductase, a Zn-dependent reductase (and a Zn2+ transport system), and an integrase, among others. Notably, every ISS-isolate uniquely contained the transcriptional repressor LexA, which was not shared with the type strain or otherwise similar genomes. In our genome collection, we also searched against the CARD database to identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes (Supp Table 2). In addition, for ISS and clinical strains used to assess antimicrobial phenotypic characteristics, we searched genomes against the CARD, , ARG-ANNOT, and ResFinder databases and verified predicted AMR status and gene identity of flagged sequences (those not having a 100% identity match) by blasting against GenBank’s non-redundant protein sequence database. We identified a bolus of AMR markers, with the 20 ISS genomes possessing a total of 10 distinct resistance gene families (9/10 gene families were in every ISS genome). Each genome contained potential resistance to 11 drug classes through 4 general resistance mechanisms (antibiotic efflux, antibiotic inactivation, target alteration, and reduced permeability for the antibiotic). However, the presence of resistance mechanisms and genes did not discriminate between the Earth and ISS-associated strains. However, the ISS-genomes did hierarchically cluster primarily with human-associated strains and contained a large diversity of genes that could potentially confer antibiotic resistance (Supp Fig. 1). Antimicrobial phenotypic characteristics of A. pittii strains We tested 16 clinically relevant antibiotics for which the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) has established breakpoints for Acinetobacter species, as these are the commonly used antimicrobial agents administered to treat infections caused by this opportunistic pathogen (Fig. 3, Supp Table 2). The well-characterized Earth strains PR-313, PR-348, and PR-429 isolated from clinical samples were used as comparators in this study [16]. Clinical isolates PR-313 and PR-429 were the two strains that consistently grouped phylogenetically with the ISS strains in this study (Fig. 1A). PR-429 was placed distantly in our phylogenetic analysis. These three strains were susceptible to all antibiotic compounds tested, with the exception that PR-313 showed resistance to ceftriaxone (MIC = 32 μg/ml, intermediate resistance, I) as did ISS strains. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Antimicrobial susceptibility testing data of the various A. pittii strains. The results of antimicrobial testing of the ISS isolates vs. comparable clinical isolates. See Supp Table 2 for a more detailed view of these analysesAll ISS A. pittii isolates (n = 20) tested were susceptible to the commercially available and often used carbapenems: meropenem and imipenem; the fluoroquinolones: ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin; the aminoglycoside gentamicin; and tetracycline. The susceptibility to the other antimicrobials is typical of A. pittii. The isolates were also predominantly susceptible to minocycline [19/20 isolates; one isolate MIC > 8 μg/ml, resistant (R)], and the aminoglycosides amikacin (19/20 isolates; one isolate MIC = 32 μg/ml, I) and tobramycin (19/20 isolates; one isolate MIC > 8 μg/ml, R). Susceptibility to ceftazidime was more notable, as only one ISS isolate demonstrated resistance (MIC = 16 μg/ml, I). The potency of the cephalosporins varied widely as can be seen from the MICs listed in Supp Table 2. All ISS isolates demonstrated resistance to cefotaxime (MICs 16–32 μg/ml, I), and unlike the clinical isolates (n=3), most ISS strains were also resistant to cefepime (14/20 isolates: MIC = 16 μg/ml, n = 11, I; MIC > 16 μg/ml, n = 3, R) and ceftriaxone (17/20 isolates: MIC = 32 μg/ml, I). For β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, 3/20 isolates were resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam (MIC = 16/8 μg/ml, n = 2, I; MIC > 16/8 μg/ml, n = 1, R), and 5/20 isolates were non-susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam (MIC = 32/4 μg/ml, I). In addition, 4/20 isolates were resistant to a combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (MIC > 2/38 μg/ml, R). One strain each from MT-1 (IIF1SW-P4) and MT-2 (F8_7S_12B) flight mission exhibited multi-drug resistance (6 out of 16 antimicrobials) and were isolated from Cupola (IIF1SW-P4) and US Lab (F8_7S_12B) locations. ISS-bound A. pittii contain genetically discrete accessory genomes from Earth-bound strains Our prior analyses provided a sense of functions that were gained or lost by different strains of A. pittii; however, they do not necessarily capture difficult-to-annotate sequences (i.e., genetic dark matter) or provide a sense of gene-level (or mutational-level) similarity between isolates. To explore this space, we identified a total of 43,948 core and accessory genes across all A. pittii isolates and MAGs. Via hierarchically clustering the consensus genes from the pangenome, we observed a set of sequences that were present in 100% of ISS genomes and only a small proportion (< 10%) of Earth genomes (Fig. 4A, yellow box). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Identifying the ISS-associated-accessory genes of A. pittii. A A hierarchically clustered visualization of the A. pittii pangenome. Each column is a gene, and each row is a sample. The bottom rows indicate the proportions of ISS or Earth isolates in which a given gene was identified. The yellow box indicates the presence of genes particularly associated with the genomes of ISS strains. B, C The output of a gene-level association study comparing ISS and Earth strains. The volcano plot in B indicates the distribution of odds ratios between genes enriched in and lost in space flight. The top 30 most ISS-associated, non-hypothetical, distinct proteins with the highest odds ratios are labeled. Point color corresponds to the fraction of ISS genomes in which a gene is found. C The genomic context of significant, non-hypothetical, genes. The x-axis is the concatenation of all contigs in a representative ISS isolate. Blank spots on this axis contain genes or portions of the genome that were not evaluated in the association study due to the low prevalenceThis observation motivated us to carry out a gene-level, pangenome association study with the aim of determining the “ISS-associated-accessory genome” of A. pittii. Adjusting for population stratification due to shared lineage, we used logistic regression to test the association between 7411 gene sequences that were found in between 5 and 100% of all samples. After correcting for the false discovery rate, we identified a total of 175 significant positive associations with the ISS that were present in 100% of ISS A. pittii and <10% of the Earth strains (Fig. 4B, Supp Table 3). These genes had limited annotations, occurred across the genome (Fig. 4C), and corresponded to 15 unique, non-hypothetical proteins that included UmuC (involved in ultraviolet radiation protection), DNA repair (e.g., RecF), the FhuE receptor for ferric iron uptake, arsenate reductase, and other stress-response proteins (e.g., the ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH). However, a gene-level association study does not necessarily identify the truly unique mutational signatures of space-bound A. pittii. This analysis needs to be grounded in a clear comparison to the most closely related Earth-bound strains. With this in mind, we computed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and insertion/deletion (indel) genome-wide association study (GWAS, Supp Table 3) using the strains in the right panel of Fig. 1A, which were most closely related to the ISS strains. We used PR-313 as the reference genome for joint variant calling across the 40 genomes for which we were able to find raw reads. Joint variant calling yielded >40,000 variations across all 40 genomes. The majority of significantly associated features with the ISS were SNPs, and they occurred across all contigs (Fig. 5A). Fifty-one of these SNPs were ostensibly outside of coding sequences, whereas only 161 were in open Open-Reading-Frames (Fig. 5B). A total of 16 insertions and 16 deletions, half of which were intergenic, were statistically associated with spaceflight. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab The SNPs and indels associated with ISS A. pittii.

C Open-Reading-Frames (genes) with the top number of associated features. Numbers on the x-axis correspond to a position on a given contigDespite many associated features scattered around the genome, there were a few key genes and regions that seemed to have more mutational burden than others. In other words, these portions of the genome had the greatest variation relative to the most closely related Earth-bound strains. The genes with more than one mutation are reported in Fig. 5C with their relative position on different contigs. Three of these coding sequences were consecutive regions in the genome and coded for three different methionine sulfoxide reductases, which are involved in oxidative stress response [15]. The gene with the most protein variation was hypothetical and had no known annotation, even when annotated by alignment to the UniRef90 database.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Here, we report the progressive changes in the genetics and abundance of A. pittii aboard the ISS. We demonstrated that it forms a genetically and functionally distinct clade set apart from most genomes isolated on Earth and that the ISS strains appear to be prevalent and changing in relative abundance through the environment of the space station. We note that none of the ISS isolates or Earth-based isolates were isolated at or stored at the same facility, ruling out contamination as a potential source of genomic similarity between the closely-related strains. In addition to characterizing functions that A. pittii is gaining on the ISS, we additionally determined a set of 175 genes and 208 SNPs/indels enriched in ISS-associated genomes. Our study, of course, is not without drawbacks. First, we cannot prove true succession without ecological-scale analysis or increasing absolute abundance without a measure such as qPCR. As a result, we only argue for “potential succession.” We feel this hypothesis is strengthened given the fact that with consistent swabbing and culturing approaches, 3X more colonies were identified across the MT2 flights compared to MT1. Second, in our analysis of coverage in Fig. 2B, the higher values we observed ranged from 25 to 50%—while the increase between missions is encouraging, deeper sequencing would help to further confirm the continued presence of A. pittii and recover additional MAGs. While A. pittii is primarily a risk to immunocompromised individuals (who have historically not been astronauts), the proliferation of private spaceflight has enabled greater access to space for individuals of diverse medical backgrounds. Consider the recent Inspiration4 mission, where a cancer survivor and amputee was one of four crew members. As a result, comparative genomics on even low-risk pathogens, especially those with a propensity for HGT, is worth reporting. The functions and genes gained and lost by A. pittii over the course of the MT1 and MT2 missions are particularly interesting. These results, of course, could be strengthened by checking gene annotations with an even wider array of software. The fact that 100% of MT2 strains had the RelBE toxin-antitoxin system may indicate an increased ability to withstand osmotic stress (Supp Table 2) [17]. Similarly, an increased number of transposases and transcriptional regulators could potentially improve fitness in the harsh environment of the ISS. Conversely, the gain of genes and functions associated with sulfate and metal oxidation (Fig. 4) could indicate A. pittii swapping to alternative carbon sources more suited to the ISS. LexA was the only COG found uniquely across all ISS-associated strains and not identified in any Earth strains. We hypothesize that this indicates possible selection pressure on A. pittii’s DNA damage response, due to high radiation levels and other harsh conditions aboard the ISS. The LexA protein is a key regulator of the SOS response to DNA damage in Escherichia coli and many other bacteria [18–20]. The protein RecA (which was flagged in our gene-level association study as well), when bound to ssDNA, cleaves LexA. This de-represses transcription of multiple SOS genes, which halt cell division and lysis, initiate DNA repair, and induce mutagenesis directed by error-prone polymerases, as well as partially regulating toxin-antitoxin activity and biofilm formation [20, 21]. Acinetobacter species normally lack the LexA protein and have a separate mechanism for SOS signaling and response to stress that requires RecA, which is not well-understood [22]. Multiple genes, including umuDAb and ddrR, which are unique to Acinetobacter appear to serve a similar role to lexA, but only for a subset of SOS genes; research continues in this area since antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter as a result of SOS mutagenesis is a pressing problem for human health [23, 24]. It is potentially concerning that A. pittii ISS strains have acquired a part of the SOS pathway that related Acinetobacter isolates lack. Whether lexA detected in all ISS strains of A. pittii is being expressed and whether acquired LexA could actually serve as a repressor of SOS response genes in Acinetobacter species, would require significant further study as this has potential implications for the emergence of resistance to a variety of antibiotics. One possibility is that an active acquired LexA suppressor might give a competitive growth advantage for A. pittii in the space environment by slowing the SOS response, which would be highly active due to DNA damage from the high-radiation environment of the ISS. The observation of three back-to-back proteins with a large mutational burden, all being methionine sulfoxide reductases, is particularly striking. Compared to other amino acids, methionine residues are more likely to undergo oxidation. Peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) enzymes appear to protect cells from widespread oxidative damage by restoring function to proteins with oxidized methionine residues, though in some species such as S. aureus, these repair enzymes are expressed in response to antibiotics or sunlight exposure rather than oxidation [15]. The enzymes MsrA and MsrB repair oxidative damage to the (S) and (R) forms of methionine sulfoxide, respectively [25]. In bacteria, certain deletions in msrA and msrB can lead to species-specific effects such as decreased resistance to oxidants and cleaning products, decreased antibiotic resistance, decreased virulence, and decreased ability to survive within a eukaryotic host [26] For example, Salmonella typhimurium msrA knockout mutants are 3000x more sensitive to hypochlorite and less able to survive inside a host cell [3, 27]. However, we do not know how specific mutations in the msrA and msrB genes of the ISS A. pittii affect its functionality. The antimicrobial resistance results are also of interest, especially given that while carrying similar genetic signatures for antimicrobial resistance, ISS A. pittii have a discrete phenotypic profile from similar Earth strains. The susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem is consistent with the genetic analyses that did not reveal the common carbapenemases in Acinetobacter species that confer a carbapenem-resistant phenotype (no detection of the major groups blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-24/40-like, blaOXA-235-like, blaNDM, blaVIM, or blaIMP). Cefepime and ceftazidime are often used as a therapy against Acinetobacter infections when susceptibility is detected, but resistance to cefepime in ISS strains might be related to the microgravity stress. The intrinsic Acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinase blaADC-18 and the intrinsic oxacillinase blaOXA-500 genes were detected in all isolates except for outgroup strain PR-348, in which the cephalosporinase blaADC-150 and the oxacillinase blaOXA-421 were detected. In addition, all isolates appeared to be clonal and were Pasteur multi-locus sequence type 64 [28]. Strains of A. pittii isolated aboard the ISS on two different missions separated by nearly 4 years appear to all belong to the same clonal lineage; only two Earth strains collected, sequenced, and deposited into GenBank thus far, from human patients, belong to this same lineage. The resistance of some ISS strains to ampicillin/sulbactam is particularly significant, as this β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination is often used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter species infections [29–31]. Antimicrobial resistance exhibited by the ISS isolates tested in this study specifically with regard to cefotaxime and cefepime was notable since the two related strains isolated from patients were not resistant. The enhanced AMR phenotype by the ISS strains is interesting, and this phenomenon should be confirmed by exposing the susceptible Earth strains to simulated microgravity conditions to understand whether microgravity influences the enhanced AMR in Acinetobacter species.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions A microbe’s ability to grow and survive in variable conditions is defined by its ability to respond to various environmental demands under suboptimal conditions. The advantage of microbes, having a short generation time, is that their mutational frequency allows for great genetic diversity. Here, we describe the “ISS effect,” where microbes may adapt to the extreme environment of the ISS through mechanisms that enhance their survival and may contribute to augmented antimicrobial resistance (despite not being exposed to antimicrobials). We show the potential ecological succession of A. pittii aboard the ISS as well as the longitudinal effects of the ISS effect via increased mutational frequencies and acquisition of further stress-associated protein-coding genes. We additionally identify particular, highly variable, sequences of interest (i.e., MSR enzymes) that are worth further investigation as spaceflight-impacted genes. Overall, we found that the extreme environment of the ISS is possibly exacting an intense selective pressure on A. pittii, and the nature of the genomic changes warrant continued observation in the years to come.",

Copyright notice ID: 9743659 PMID: 36503581 Abstract Background Monitoring the adaptation of microorganisms to the extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is crucial to understanding microbial evolution and infection prevention. Acinetobacter pittii is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen, primarily impacting immunocompromised patients, that was recently isolated from two missions aboard the ISS.Results Here, we report how ISS-associated A. pittii (n = 20 genomes) has formed its own genetically and functionally discrete clade distinct from most Earth-bound isolates (n = 291 genomes). The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ISS strains and two related clinical isolates demonstrated that ISS strains acquired more resistance, specifically with regard to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, despite no prediction of increased resistance based on genomic analysis of resistance genes. By investigating 402 longitudinal environmental and host-associated ISS metagenomes, we observed that viable A. pittii is increasing in relative abundance and therefore potentially exhibiting succession, being identified in >2X more metagenomic samples in back-to-back missions. ISS strains additionally contain functions that enable them to survive in harsh environments, including the transcriptional regulator LexA. Via a genome-wide association study, we identified a high level of mutational burden in methionine sulfoxide reductase genes relative to the most closely related Earth strains.Conclusions Overall, these results indicated a step forward in understanding how microorganisms might evolve and alter their antibiotic resistance phenotype in extreme, resource-limited, human-built environments.

While humans also encounter these challenges during space flight and, indeed, our physiology is impacted by prolonged exposure—microbes possess the unique ability to adapt quickly due to rapid cell division (thereby mutation) and the acquisition of external DNA elements through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [1]. Given the pivotal roles microbes play in human health and physiology (e.g., ranging from pathogens to arbiters of a healthy gut), understanding how we can expect specific microbes to adapt to space-based ecosystems is essential for ensuring crew safety and health during longer space missions. The International Space Station (ISS) is perhaps the paradigm of experimental “built environments” to observe such microbial adaptation in action. After all, all life on the ISS had to originate on Earth, and this makes it the ideal place to study, in a contained environment, how life changes in orbit. To date, there have been numerous other examples of microbes changing after being exposed to space. These include fungal adaptation to the ISS as a function of microgravity and changes in Agrobacterium genome composition, among others [2–4]. Recently, the microbe Acinetobacter pittii was isolated from surfaces within the ISS during two microbial-monitoring missions (referred to as microbial tracking-1 [MT1] and microbial tracking-2 [MT2]) [2, 5]. A. pittii is an opportunistic, Biosafety Level (BSL) 2 pathogen capable of causing potentially fatal infection, most commonly in immunocompromised patients in clinical settings [6, 7]. Bacteremia deriving from A. pittii has been observed as having a 17% 28-day mortality rate [8], though healthy individuals are usually not at risk of infection. Members of the genus Acinetobacter tend to be multi-drug-resistant and more commonly isolated from hospital settings as a result of their ability to resist environmental disinfectants and their potential for aerosolization [9]. In addition, A. pittii has been observed in various built environment settings other than hospitals (e.g., household objects) [10]. Many diverse A. pittii genomes are available from a variety of settings, making it an excellent model for comparative genomics. The presence of a nosocomial BSL-2 pathogen in space warrants investigation in and of itself as the potential for human infection in this extreme environment raises concern; additionally, A. pittii is particularly adept at HGT in a simulated microgravity [1]. This indicates a propensity for rapid adaptation to conditions aboard the ISS and acquiring additional genes that could contribute to antibiotic resistance. As a result, monitoring the biology of A. pittii, and how strains are changing in space, is of high priority. Finally, understanding how an organism, especially a pathogen, is changing and whether it is propagating is critical to our ability to design effective infection prevention strategies. In other words, is it colonizing and spreading via the human body, or is it limited to the environment? Answering this metapangenomic [11] question requires both longitudinal sampling of human (e.g., the oral microbiome) and environmental (e.g., the space station viewports) metagenomes to identify the presence or absence of specific strains in complex microbial communities over time. Here, we jointly used longitudinally collected isolates and metagenomic sequencing to measure changes to A. pittii genomes across time in space. We compared clinical strains isolated on Earth to cultured organisms from the space station and those de novo assembled into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). We described the specific gene and phenotype changes possibly occurring as a function of exposure to space, and we identified where A. pittii is most prevalent across the ISS.Results A. pittii isolated from the ISS have become phylogenetically distinct from Earth-bound strains We built a dataset comprising publicly available assembled genomes, metagenomic bins, and assembled, not-yet-public genomes that our team had sequenced from the ISS (Table 1). We downloaded 319 genomes annotated as A. pittii from the ’s (’s) assembly database. Five of these were isolated from the ISS mission MT1 (flight 2), whereas 15 were from MT2 (flight 8) [12, 13]. The MT1/MT2 isolations were performed with similar swabbing and dilution protocols. We ran the genomes through GTDB-tK to confirm their taxonomy, removing eight from analysis due to their being annotated as other species (e.g., Acinetobacter baumannii). Table 1.

These samples comprised 42 from environmental sites on the MT1 mission, 60 from environmental sites on the MT2 mission, 246 from different crew body sites on the MT2 mission, and 54 from the crew of the NASA Twins Study, which took place prior to the MT1/MT2 missions [5, 14]. We annotated only two MAGs as A. pittii using GTDB-tK. Both genomes were >99% complete, had <1% contamination, and were from environmental samples from the MT1 mission (samples SRR6853346 and SRR6853362, both from flight 2). These brought the total number of A. pittii genomes (including MAGs and isolates) carried forward for the rest of the analysis to 313 (Table 1, Supp Table 1). We then built phylogenetic trees (with four different approaches ranging from marker-gene-based to SNP-based) for the resultant strains of A. pittii isolated from or identified on the ISS versus those from different Earth environments (Fig. 1, Supp Figs. 1 and 2). We identified that ISS A. pittii isolates formed a distinct clade from strains associated with all other ecosystems. Across all trees, only two strains, both isolated from infected patients, from Earth additionally fell in this clade. Given their placement, we focused specifically on grounding our proximal functional, antimicrobial, and genetic analysis of the ISS strains in comparison to these two strains (referred to as PR-313 and PR-429). By comparison, isolates from other ecosystems (e.g., human blood, wastewater) did not cluster together based on phylogeny to the same level as those from the ISS, and, overall, other A. pittii from the environmental ecosystems were phylogenetically distinct from the ISS strains. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab A. pittii from the ISS as compared to publicly available genomes.

B SNP level similarity of the ISS isolates and two closely related Earth strains as well as a related patient isolate, referred to as “type strain.” Names in the gray bar are the identity of the reference genome to which all others on the x-axes were compared. P values were generated from Wilcox tests. CSF refers to cerebrospinal fluidWe additionally compared PR-313, PR-429, and the assembly of the A. pittii type strain (GenBank accession GCA_000369045.1, ATCC 19004, acquired from a patient blood sample) to the ISS isolates (not including the MAGs) at the SNP-level (Fig. 1B). ISS A. pittii strains differed from the type strain by an average of 52,546 SNPs. They differed from PR-313 and PR-429 by 899 and 1040 SNPs on average, respectively. The MT2 isolates had more SNPs relative to all three references than the MT1 isolates (p < 0.001). A. pittii’s potential succession through the built environment of the ISS Next, we aimed to determine the source and observe the potential succession of A. pittii on the ISS based on shifts in relative abundance (as opposed to absolute abundance), which is an approach we have taken in prior work [15]. In the same shotgun sequenced samples from which we identified our metagenomic bins, we computed the abundance of A. pittii using Kraken2. We stratified this analysis by metagenomes that had, versus had not, been treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to remove non-viable cells. We noted the potential succession of viable A. pittii throughout the environment of the ISS (Fig. 2A). We identified more reads mapping to A. pittii in the environmental samples than in the human samples, and its relative abundance was higher in PMA-treated environmental metagenomes (p = 0.0063) in the MT2 mission. Overall, its abundance increased between the two missions (p < 0.001). The majority of A. pittii abundance during the MT1 flight was in a small number of samples. One environmental metagenome from the MT1 mission had extremely high levels of A. pittii abundance (SRR6853346, relative abundance = 52.1%). This and the MT1 sample with the second-highest abundance (SRR6853362, relative abundance = 12.8%) were the ones we were able to assemble MAGs from, and they were taken from the port panel next to Cupola node 3 on the ISS. The median relative abundance of A. pittii (0.02%) during the MT2 mission was the highest by an order of magnitude compared to the other metagenomic sources. Further, short reads mapped to A. pittii with Kraken2 were identified in more locations across the ISS in MT2 than in MT1 (19/42 [45.2%] metagenomes in MT1 vs. 48/60 [80%] in MT2). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab The distribution and potential succession of A. pittii aboard the ISS. All p values are derived from Wilcox tests.

B The percent genome coverage with at least 3 reads aligning to each of the two A. pittii metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) identified in our analysis. C The proportion of reads aligning to each of these MAGs from environmental metagenomes. D The abundance of A. pittii strains as a function of specific flights. The proportion of reads aligning to MAGs broken down by each flight in the MT1 and MT2 missions. P values in this panel correspond to the change in abundance between the first and last flights (top) and the different missions (bottom)To further explore the spread of A. pittii throughout the ISS, we next searched specifically for the presence of the two MAGs we identified previously in all the environmental metagenomic samples in our dataset. We computed the fraction of raw reads in each metagenome aligning back to the MAGs (Fig. 2B, C). We observed a statistically significant (p < 0.001) increase in both the coverage and relative abundance of the genomes. Metagenomes treated with PMA had higher coverage (p < 0.05) in both missions. To gain an even higher-resolution view into the potential succession of A. pittii aboard the ISS, we broke down its shifts in abundance as a function of flight. The MT1 mission consisted of three longitudinal flights (i.e., time points), whereas the MT2 consisted of four, with increasing average abundance from flight one to seven in A. pittii MAGs (Fig. 2D). Changes in abundance between flights 1 and 7 were statistically significant (p < 0.001), as well as between flights 3 and 4 (the gap between the missions).ISS-associated A. pittii are becoming functionally distinct from Earth-bound strains We next aimed to determine how the ISS A. pittii varied genetically and functionally compared to its Earth counterparts. We identified and functionally annotated all the Open-Reading-Frames (ORFs, which refer to the coding sequences of a microbial genome) in each of the 313 genomes/MAGs. In total, we identified 1,188,894 genes and 1459 distinct Clusters of Orthologous Gene (COG) annotations (Supp Table 2). Initially, we sought to identify similarities and differences in COGs annotated to ORFs present in five different genome “types”: the genomes of the MT1 and MT2 isolates, the MAGs, the type strain, and the two human isolates that were consistently grouped in the ISS clade (as described in Fig. 1). Nineteen COGs were present in all genome types except the type strain. These included two transketolases, a type II secretion mechanism (PulG), a sulfoxide reductase and sulfatase maturation enzyme, an alcohol dehydrogenase, a curcumin reductase, a Zn-dependent reductase (and a Zn2+ transport system), and an integrase, among others. Notably, every ISS-isolate uniquely contained the transcriptional repressor LexA, which was not shared with the type strain or otherwise similar genomes. In our genome collection, we also searched against the CARD database to identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes (Supp Table 2). In addition, for ISS and clinical strains used to assess antimicrobial phenotypic characteristics, we searched genomes against the CARD, , ARG-ANNOT, and ResFinder databases and verified predicted AMR status and gene identity of flagged sequences (those not having a 100% identity match) by blasting against GenBank’s non-redundant protein sequence database. We identified a bolus of AMR markers, with the 20 ISS genomes possessing a total of 10 distinct resistance gene families (9/10 gene families were in every ISS genome). Each genome contained potential resistance to 11 drug classes through 4 general resistance mechanisms (antibiotic efflux, antibiotic inactivation, target alteration, and reduced permeability for the antibiotic). However, the presence of resistance mechanisms and genes did not discriminate between the Earth and ISS-associated strains. However, the ISS-genomes did hierarchically cluster primarily with human-associated strains and contained a large diversity of genes that could potentially confer antibiotic resistance (Supp Fig. 1).Antimicrobial phenotypic characteristics of A. pittii strains We tested 16 clinically relevant antibiotics for which the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) has established breakpoints for Acinetobacter species, as these are the commonly used antimicrobial agents administered to treat infections caused by this opportunistic pathogen (Fig. 3, Supp Table 2). The well-characterized Earth strains PR-313, PR-348, and PR-429 isolated from clinical samples were used as comparators in this study [16]. Clinical isolates PR-313 and PR-429 were the two strains that consistently grouped phylogenetically with the ISS strains in this study (Fig. 1A). PR-429 was placed distantly in our phylogenetic analysis. These three strains were susceptible to all antibiotic compounds tested, with the exception that PR-313 showed resistance to ceftriaxone (MIC = 32 μg/ml, intermediate resistance, I) as did ISS strains. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Antimicrobial susceptibility testing data of the various A. pittii strains. The results of antimicrobial testing of the ISS isolates vs. comparable clinical isolates. See Supp Table 2 for a more detailed view of these analysesAll ISS A. pittii isolates (n = 20) tested were susceptible to the commercially available and often used carbapenems: meropenem and imipenem; the fluoroquinolones: ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin; the aminoglycoside gentamicin; and tetracycline. The susceptibility to the other antimicrobials is typical of A. pittii. The isolates were also predominantly susceptible to minocycline [19/20 isolates; one isolate MIC > 8 μg/ml, resistant (R)], and the aminoglycosides amikacin (19/20 isolates; one isolate MIC = 32 μg/ml, I) and tobramycin (19/20 isolates; one isolate MIC > 8 μg/ml, R). Susceptibility to ceftazidime was more notable, as only one ISS isolate demonstrated resistance (MIC = 16 μg/ml, I). The potency of the cephalosporins varied widely as can be seen from the MICs listed in Supp Table 2. All ISS isolates demonstrated resistance to cefotaxime (MICs 16–32 μg/ml, I), and unlike the clinical isolates (n=3), most ISS strains were also resistant to cefepime (14/20 isolates: MIC = 16 μg/ml, n = 11, I; MIC > 16 μg/ml, n = 3, R) and ceftriaxone (17/20 isolates: MIC = 32 μg/ml, I). For β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, 3/20 isolates were resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam (MIC = 16/8 μg/ml, n = 2, I; MIC > 16/8 μg/ml, n = 1, R), and 5/20 isolates were non-susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam (MIC = 32/4 μg/ml, I). In addition, 4/20 isolates were resistant to a combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (MIC > 2/38 μg/ml, R). One strain each from MT-1 (IIF1SW-P4) and MT-2 (F8_7S_12B) flight mission exhibited multi-drug resistance (6 out of 16 antimicrobials) and were isolated from Cupola (IIF1SW-P4) and US Lab (F8_7S_12B) locations.ISS-bound A. pittii contain genetically discrete accessory genomes from Earth-bound strains Our prior analyses provided a sense of functions that were gained or lost by different strains of A. pittii; however, they do not necessarily capture difficult-to-annotate sequences (i.e., genetic dark matter) or provide a sense of gene-level (or mutational-level) similarity between isolates. To explore this space, we identified a total of 43,948 core and accessory genes across all A. pittii isolates and MAGs. Via hierarchically clustering the consensus genes from the pangenome, we observed a set of sequences that were present in 100% of ISS genomes and only a small proportion (< 10%) of Earth genomes (Fig. 4A, yellow box). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Identifying the ISS-associated-accessory genes of A. pittii. A A hierarchically clustered visualization of the A. pittii pangenome. Each column is a gene, and each row is a sample. The bottom rows indicate the proportions of ISS or Earth isolates in which a given gene was identified. The yellow box indicates the presence of genes particularly associated with the genomes of ISS strains. B, C The output of a gene-level association study comparing ISS and Earth strains. The volcano plot in B indicates the distribution of odds ratios between genes enriched in and lost in space flight. The top 30 most ISS-associated, non-hypothetical, distinct proteins with the highest odds ratios are labeled. Point color corresponds to the fraction of ISS genomes in which a gene is found. C The genomic context of significant, non-hypothetical, genes. The x-axis is the concatenation of all contigs in a representative ISS isolate. Blank spots on this axis contain genes or portions of the genome that were not evaluated in the association study due to the low prevalenceThis observation motivated us to carry out a gene-level, pangenome association study with the aim of determining the “ISS-associated-accessory genome” of A. pittii. Adjusting for population stratification due to shared lineage, we used logistic regression to test the association between 7411 gene sequences that were found in between 5 and 100% of all samples. After correcting for the false discovery rate, we identified a total of 175 significant positive associations with the ISS that were present in 100% of ISS A. pittii and <10% of the Earth strains (Fig. 4B, Supp Table 3). These genes had limited annotations, occurred across the genome (Fig. 4C), and corresponded to 15 unique, non-hypothetical proteins that included UmuC (involved in ultraviolet radiation protection), DNA repair (e.g., RecF), the FhuE receptor for ferric iron uptake, arsenate reductase, and other stress-response proteins (e.g., the ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH). However, a gene-level association study does not necessarily identify the truly unique mutational signatures of space-bound A. pittii. This analysis needs to be grounded in a clear comparison to the most closely related Earth-bound strains. With this in mind, we computed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and insertion/deletion (indel) genome-wide association study (GWAS, Supp Table 3) using the strains in the right panel of Fig. 1A, which were most closely related to the ISS strains. We used PR-313 as the reference genome for joint variant calling across the 40 genomes for which we were able to find raw reads. Joint variant calling yielded >40,000 variations across all 40 genomes. The majority of significantly associated features with the ISS were SNPs, and they occurred across all contigs (Fig. 5A). Fifty-one of these SNPs were ostensibly outside of coding sequences, whereas only 161 were in open Open-Reading-Frames (Fig. 5B). A total of 16 insertions and 16 deletions, half of which were intergenic, were statistically associated with spaceflight. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab The SNPs and indels associated with ISS A. pittii.

B A summary of the results for our GWAS in terms of the number of significant findings versus the total number of features identified in joint variant calling. C Open-Reading-Frames (genes) with the top number of associated features. Numbers on the x-axis correspond to a position on a given contigDespite many associated features scattered around the genome, there were a few key genes and regions that seemed to have more mutational burden than others. In other words, these portions of the genome had the greatest variation relative to the most closely related Earth-bound strains. The genes with more than one mutation are reported in Fig. 5C with their relative position on different contigs. Three of these coding sequences were consecutive regions in the genome and coded for three different methionine sulfoxide reductases, which are involved in oxidative stress response [15]. The gene with the most protein variation was hypothetical and had no known annotation, even when annotated by alignment to the UniRef90 database.Discussion Here, we report the progressive changes in the genetics and abundance of A. pittii aboard the ISS. We demonstrated that it forms a genetically and functionally distinct clade set apart from most genomes isolated on Earth and that the ISS strains appear to be prevalent and changing in relative abundance through the environment of the space station. We note that none of the ISS isolates or Earth-based isolates were isolated at or stored at the same facility, ruling out contamination as a potential source of genomic similarity between the closely-related strains. In addition to characterizing functions that A. pittii is gaining on the ISS, we additionally determined a set of 175 genes and 208 SNPs/indels enriched in ISS-associated genomes. Our study, of course, is not without drawbacks. First, we cannot prove true succession without ecological-scale analysis or increasing absolute abundance without a measure such as qPCR. As a result, we only argue for “potential succession.” We feel this hypothesis is strengthened given the fact that with consistent swabbing and culturing approaches, 3X more colonies were identified across the MT2 flights compared to MT1. Second, in our analysis of coverage in Fig. 2B, the higher values we observed ranged from 25 to 50%—while the increase between missions is encouraging, deeper sequencing would help to further confirm the continued presence of A. pittii and recover additional MAGs. While A. pittii is primarily a risk to immunocompromised individuals (who have historically not been astronauts), the proliferation of private spaceflight has enabled greater access to space for individuals of diverse medical backgrounds. Consider the recent Inspiration4 mission, where a cancer survivor and amputee was one of four crew members. As a result, comparative genomics on even low-risk pathogens, especially those with a propensity for HGT, is worth reporting. The functions and genes gained and lost by A. pittii over the course of the MT1 and MT2 missions are particularly interesting. These results, of course, could be strengthened by checking gene annotations with an even wider array of software. The fact that 100% of MT2 strains had the RelBE toxin-antitoxin system may indicate an increased ability to withstand osmotic stress (Supp Table 2) [17]. Similarly, an increased number of transposases and transcriptional regulators could potentially improve fitness in the harsh environment of the ISS. Conversely, the gain of genes and functions associated with sulfate and metal oxidation (Fig. 4) could indicate A. pittii swapping to alternative carbon sources more suited to the ISS. LexA was the only COG found uniquely across all ISS-associated strains and not identified in any Earth strains. We hypothesize that this indicates possible selection pressure on A. pittii’s DNA damage response, due to high radiation levels and other harsh conditions aboard the ISS. The LexA protein is a key regulator of the SOS response to DNA damage in Escherichia coli and many other bacteria [18–20]. The protein RecA (which was flagged in our gene-level association study as well), when bound to ssDNA, cleaves LexA. This de-represses transcription of multiple SOS genes, which halt cell division and lysis, initiate DNA repair, and induce mutagenesis directed by error-prone polymerases, as well as partially regulating toxin-antitoxin activity and biofilm formation [20, 21]. Acinetobacter species normally lack the LexA protein and have a separate mechanism for SOS signaling and response to stress that requires RecA, which is not well-understood [22]. Multiple genes, including umuDAb and ddrR, which are unique to Acinetobacter appear to serve a similar role to lexA, but only for a subset of SOS genes; research continues in this area since antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter as a result of SOS mutagenesis is a pressing problem for human health [23, 24]. It is potentially concerning that A. pittii ISS strains have acquired a part of the SOS pathway that related Acinetobacter isolates lack. Whether lexA detected in all ISS strains of A. pittii is being expressed and whether acquired LexA could actually serve as a repressor of SOS response genes in Acinetobacter species, would require significant further study as this has potential implications for the emergence of resistance to a variety of antibiotics. One possibility is that an active acquired LexA suppressor might give a competitive growth advantage for A. pittii in the space environment by slowing the SOS response, which would be highly active due to DNA damage from the high-radiation environment of the ISS. The observation of three back-to-back proteins with a large mutational burden, all being methionine sulfoxide reductases, is particularly striking. Compared to other amino acids, methionine residues are more likely to undergo oxidation. Peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) enzymes appear to protect cells from widespread oxidative damage by restoring function to proteins with oxidized methionine residues, though in some species such as S. aureus, these repair enzymes are expressed in response to antibiotics or sunlight exposure rather than oxidation [15]. The enzymes MsrA and MsrB repair oxidative damage to the (S) and (R) forms of methionine sulfoxide, respectively [25]. In bacteria, certain deletions in msrA and msrB can lead to species-specific effects such as decreased resistance to oxidants and cleaning products, decreased antibiotic resistance, decreased virulence, and decreased ability to survive within a eukaryotic host [26] For example, Salmonella typhimurium msrA knockout mutants are 3000x more sensitive to hypochlorite and less able to survive inside a host cell [3, 27]. However, we do not know how specific mutations in the msrA and msrB genes of the ISS A. pittii affect its functionality. The antimicrobial resistance results are also of interest, especially given that while carrying similar genetic signatures for antimicrobial resistance, ISS A. pittii have a discrete phenotypic profile from similar Earth strains. The susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem is consistent with the genetic analyses that did not reveal the common carbapenemases in Acinetobacter species that confer a carbapenem-resistant phenotype (no detection of the major groups blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-24/40-like, blaOXA-235-like, blaNDM, blaVIM, or blaIMP). Cefepime and ceftazidime are often used as a therapy against Acinetobacter infections when susceptibility is detected, but resistance to cefepime in ISS strains might be related to the microgravity stress. The intrinsic Acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinase blaADC-18 and the intrinsic oxacillinase blaOXA-500 genes were detected in all isolates except for outgroup strain PR-348, in which the cephalosporinase blaADC-150 and the oxacillinase blaOXA-421 were detected. In addition, all isolates appeared to be clonal and were Pasteur multi-locus sequence type 64 [28]. Strains of A. pittii isolated aboard the ISS on two different missions separated by nearly 4 years appear to all belong to the same clonal lineage; only two Earth strains collected, sequenced, and deposited into GenBank thus far, from human patients, belong to this same lineage. The resistance of some ISS strains to ampicillin/sulbactam is particularly significant, as this β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination is often used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter species infections [29–31]. Antimicrobial resistance exhibited by the ISS isolates tested in this study specifically with regard to cefotaxime and cefepime was notable since the two related strains isolated from patients were not resistant. The enhanced AMR phenotype by the ISS strains is interesting, and this phenomenon should be confirmed by exposing the susceptible Earth strains to simulated microgravity conditions to understand whether microgravity influences the enhanced AMR in Acinetobacter species.Conclusions A microbe’s ability to grow and survive in variable conditions is defined by its ability to respond to various environmental demands under suboptimal conditions. The advantage of microbes, having a short generation time, is that their mutational frequency allows for great genetic diversity. Here, we describe the “ISS effect,” where microbes may adapt to the extreme environment of the ISS through mechanisms that enhance their survival and may contribute to augmented antimicrobial resistance (despite not being exposed to antimicrobials). We show the potential ecological succession of A. pittii aboard the ISS as well as the longitudinal effects of the ISS effect via increased mutational frequencies and acquisition of further stress-associated protein-coding genes. We additionally identify particular, highly variable, sequences of interest (i.e., MSR enzymes) that are worth further investigation as spaceflight-impacted genes. Overall, we found that the extreme environment of the ISS is possibly exacting an intense selective pressure on A. pittii, and the nature of the genomic changes warrant continued observation in the years to come.Methods Downloading and annotating public A. pittii genomes Using the ’s entrez command line, we downloaded every genome annotated as A. pittii ( taxonomic ID48296) from the ’s assembly database. These downloaded genomes included those from the MT1 and MT2 missions as well as others isolated from the ISS. We manually searched the  BioProject, BioSample, and assembly databases for all 319 downloaded A. pittii genomes in order to determine their environment. We manually mapped environmental tables to a consistent set of terms (e.g., converting “endobronchial tube” to “respiratory tract” and searching BioSample for information on isolation sources stored in a non-standard format). The original terms, as well as the mapping therein, is reported in Supplementary Table 1.Phylogenetic annotation and computing SNP distances To confirm the taxonomy of all assembled genomes as well as those downloaded from the , we used GTDB-Tk (V1.6.0), the Genome Taxonomy Database’s accompanying toolkit that uses a variety of dependencies to place genomes into a phylogenetic tree according to a set of globally conserved marker genes [32–38]. Specifically, we sequentially employed GTDB-Tk’s identify, align, and infer functions, all with the default settings in order to taxonomically annotate and build a phylogenetic tree from our downloaded and assembled genomes. We additionally used GTDB-Tk’s resultant taxonomic classification to filter out any  genomes that were not annotated as A. pittii. For Supp Fig. 2, we plotted and annotated the GTDB-Tk phylogenetic tree in R (V4.1.1) using ggtree (V 3.0.4) [39]. For the pairwise SNP distance comparisons in Fig. 1B, we identified a core-SNP set using snippy V4.6.0 (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) for the ISS clade (i.e., all ISS MAGs/genomes and the two comparator Earth-based patient isolates we referenced throughout the study). We ran Snippy with the default settings, and its output was also used with gubbins V3.2.1 [40] and FastTree V2.1.11 [41] (also with default settings as recommended on Snippy’s README) to generate the phylogenetic tree in Supp Fig. 1B.Pangenome construction, functional annotation, and joint variant calling We first identified ORFs with Prokka V1.14.6 [42] using the default parameters. The ab initio functional annotations (i.e., COGs) for each predicted gene sequence were identified as part of Prokka’s automated pipeline, which pulls annotations from a variety of reference databases. To build a pangenome, we used ROARY running the default settings on the Prokka output. We called SNPs and indels jointly across the closely related Earth/ISS strains using SPANDx (V4.0.1) [43] with the default settings.Alternate phylogeny construction We additionally computed phylogenies for Supp Fig. 1A and Fig. 1A using the output of SPANDx (the maximum likelihood tree) and RAXmL (V8.2.12, with the following parameters: -m GTRGAMMA -p 12345), which we ran on the ROARY core alignment output.Association studies We used the presence-absence matrix output of ROARY for the gene-level association study and the filtered VCF output of SPANDx for the SNP/indel association study. We computed associations with pyseer (V1.3.9) [44]. For the gene-level analysis, we adjusted for population stratification with five principal components based on phylogenetic distances generated from the tree in Fig. 1. These distances were computed with pyseer’s built-in scripts. For the mutational analysis, we used pyseer’s mixed modeling approach with similarities built from SPANDx’s maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.Accessing metagenomic datasets We downloaded publicly available environmental metagenomic datasets from the MT1 (accession = PRJNA438545), MT2 (accession = PRJNA781277) missions, and genomes of 402 A. pittii isolates of human clinical samples. The microbial sequencing associated with astronaut samples of MT-2 study and NASA Twins study cannot be shared publicly due to Institutional Review Board (IRB). These data are available upon request in NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA) (https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Dataset).Processing and de novo assembly of ISS metagenomic data We first ran a quality control pipeline on all metagenomic samples. We used bbtools (V38.92) functions to clump reads, remove adapter contamination, and remove sequencing error (clumpify [parameters: optical=f, dupesubs=2,dedupe=t], bbduk [parameters: qout=33 trd=t hdist=1 k=27 ktrim=\"r\" mink=8 overwrite=true trimq=10 qtrim='rl' threads=10 minlength=51 maxns=-1 minbasefrequency=0.05 ecco=f], and tadpole [parameters: mode=correct, ecc=t, ecco=t]) [45]. Where necessary, we would remove unmatching reads using bbtool’s repair function (default parameters). We additionally used bowtie2 (parameters: --very-sensitive-local) to align to the human reference genome (GRCh38) [46]. We de novo assembled all metagenomic reads into contigs using metaSPAdes [47] (default settings).Constructing metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) We constructed MAGs from all metagenomic samples using an approach modeled after the literature [48]. We used bbmap [45] to align quality-controlled reads from each sample to its respective contigs resulting from the assembly. We used the alignment output with the default settings, as well as the contigs themselves, as input into MetaWRAP V1.3 (which calls metaBAT2, Maxbin2, and CONCOCT) to generate MAGs [49–52]. For each sample, we used dRep V3.2.2 [53] (parameters: -p 15 -comp 50 -pa 0.9 -sa 0.95 -nc 0.30 -cm larger) to estimate the quality of each genome and to remove redundant genome bins. We did not dereplicate genomes across samples to avoid combining distinct A. pittii strains. The quality of both A. pittii bins can be found in Supp Table 1. We classified the taxonomy of each within-sample non-redundant bin with GTDB-Tk in the same manner as for the isolate genomes.Analysis of CARD genes within isolate and bin genomes We used RGI (main) V5.2.1 running the default settings to identify antibiotic resistance genes and markers in the isolate genomes and metagenomic bins.Identifying A. pittii in metagenomic samples We used Kraken2 and Bracken (running the default settings) to estimate the abundance of A. pittii in each of our quality-controlled metagenomes [54, 55]. To search for the abundance of the specific MT1/MT2 cultured isolates and the metagenome-assembled genomes, we aligned the raw reads of each metagenome against the contigs for a given genome. We counted the number of reads aligning to a genome and, to adjust for depth of sequencing, divided by the number of read mate-pairs in each sample. As a point of comparison, we additionally included the high-quality, assembled genome of recently isolated A. pittii type ( assembly ID = GCA_000369045, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN01828154/), referred to as a type strain in this analysis.Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) Susceptibility testing using standard antibiotics was performed by broth microdilution with MicroScan Gram-negative NM56 trays (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were used as control strains as recommended in CLSI methods. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were interpreted according to the 2021 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for Acinetobacter species [56].Supplementary Information 40168_2022_1358_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx (59.7KB, xlsx) Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Several investigations on the microbial diversity and functional properties of the International Space Station (ISS) environment were carried out to understand the influence of spaceflight conditions on the microbial population. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence characteristics.Results In total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii) and one novel bacterial species (Methylobacterium ajmalii). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.Conclusions Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here on Earth.

    "introduction": "Introduction Since the publication of the first metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) in 2004 [1], MAGs have been used to confirm genomic data for taxonomic identification of uncultivated microorganisms, metabolic profiling, microbiome dynamics, and host-microbe relationships [2]. When a MAG is assembled, annotation and interpretation of genes are possible, allowing researchers to better understand the metabolic potential of the microbe, including its potential resistance to antibiotics, interactions with other microbes in the microbial community, and association with a host [3]. MAGs have been successfully used to discover uncultivated species [4], candidatus organisms like Candidatus Amarolinea aalborgensis gen. nov., sp. nov. [5], and novel genera like Spiribacter [6] and Kalamiella [7]. MAGs have also been used to recover genomic clusters of secondary metabolites [8], genetic mobility [4], metabolic pathways [9], and in situ replication [10]. Projects retrieving thousands of MAGs have also been documented to understand yet-to-be cultured microbiomes of cow rumens and other environmental samples [11]. In addition, MAGs have revealed new microbial phyla, which have expanded the tree of life [12]. Lowering sequencing cost, curated data availability in public database, and advances in computational biology have made assembling MAGs from complex and extreme environments easy. A higher number of reference genomes makes the binning easier and more reliable. Multiple best practices are available to construct accurate and complete genomes from metagenomes, but high-quality MAGs are still relatively rare. Most MAGs reported in many MAG-related papers have completeness levels between 50 and 60% [13]. Recently, MAGs generated from International Space Station (ISS) environmental metagenomes paved a way to describe a novel genus and species, Kalamiella piersonii [7]. We have retrieved four K. piersonii MAGs (100% genome sequence identity) from ISS environmental metagenomes that allowed us to identify a cultivated isolate archived from the same samples using gene-specific assays [7]. This “genome to phenome” approach enabled the differentiation of closely related genera Pantoea from Kalamiella and facilitated the isolation of several ISS strains (n = 7) that were archived and previously unidentified [7]. Furthermore, the use of MAGs and whole-genome sequences (WGS) of biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from three consecutive samplings of the ISS at eight defined locations made it possible to track the source of the original BSL-2 strain and understand the succession, persistence, and spread of this opportunistic pathogen detected in the ISS [14]. The objectives of this study were to retrieve near full-length genomes from metagenomes generated from ISS environmental samples and perform in-depth functional and phylogenetic analyses. Among 46 MAGs generated during this study, functional analyses such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence characteristic, and metabolic traits/stress responses were carried out for 20 prokaryotic MAGs. In addition to the prokaryotic MAGs (~85% completeness), this is the first-time eukaryotic MAGs (~50% completeness) were also generated from ISS metagenomes using the co-assembly strategy.",

    "results": "Results and discussion Metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes Out of the 42 ISS metagenomes submitted at , only PMA-treated metagenomes (n = 21) representing the viable/intact cells were used for generating bacterial MAGs. Characteristics of MAGs (n = 46) such as genome size (2.6 to 6.6 Mb), completeness, contamination percentage, the average mean coverage, number of scaffolds, and N50 (5 to 670 Kb) were calculated using CheckM, and assembly statistics are summarized in Table 1. Sample collection date, location, relative humidity, radiation exposure, etc. are given in Table 1, and various other details such as materials of the location and partial pressure have already been published [14, 15]. A bacterial MAG was considered acceptable during this study if CheckM completeness was more than 85% and contamination was less than 10%. When metaSPAdes was used, 20 MAGs were recovered, and housekeeping genes were used to confirm the identity, contamination, and completeness of MAGs. In addition, when metaWRAP was used, 26 MAGs were assembled from the same 21 PMA-treated ISS environmental metagenomes. When metaSPAdes and metaWRAP pipelines generated MAGs were compared, a total of 16 one-to-one matches were detected between them, suggesting these two different assembly strategies identified the identical genomes. Among the metaWRAP-assembled genomes, 11 MAGs had smaller genome sizes, which may be due to the more conservative nature of the metaWRAP procedure. The correlation between metaSPAde (20 MAGs) and metaWRAP (26 MAGs) is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 (R2 was 0.85). Table 1.

[37] bTEPC US tissue equivalent proportional counter Species assignment analysis of ISS bacterial MAGs Phylogenetic analysis of 30 unique bacterial MAGs of 46 generated showed 18 species (Table 1). The bacterial species identity was based on the average nucleotide index (ANI; > 95%) of MAGs compared with the corresponding type strain. The majority of the MAGs (22 out of 46) belonged to the members of the order Enterobacterales and matched with six established enterobacterial species. In addition, MAGs from spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus 1 MAG; Paenibacillus 4 MAGs); human skin microbes, e.g., Staphylococcus (8 MAGs); and actinobacterial (4 MAGs) members were retrieved. However, 11 MAGs were not identified to any of the genomes of well-established bacterial species. Subsequently, the gyrB gene [39] sequences were pulled from the MAGs and screened with sequences of a large number of ISS isolates (n = 500 strains) archived in our culture collection. The ISS strains that exhibited the highest gyrB sequence similarity (> 95%) were further sequenced for the whole genome and compared with the above 11 MAGs. This “metagenome to phenome” approach has enabled the description of one novel genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii; 8 MAGs; Singh et al., [7]) and another novel bacterial species, Methylobacterium ajmalii (n = 3 MAGs; Bijlani et al., 2021). Interestingly, Sphingomonadaceae MAGs retrieved from F2-7P samples that matched with yet to be identified Sphingomonas sp. K11 strain genome (GenBank no. CP013916.1) also matched with the WGS of three ISS strains isolated from the same location (flight no. 2, location no. 7). These were identified as Sphingomonas sanguinis, and functional characteristics were established, and production of plant growth-promoting substances was identified [40]. Metagenome-assembled fungal genomes Conventional tools for MAG assembly are historically not meant for eukaryotic MAG assembly (strategy 1). Additionally, the sequencing depth requirement for eukaryotic MAG assembly is much higher compared to the prokaryotic genomes. We used a co-assembly-based analysis (strategy 2), using the tool ANVIO [18] on the complete ISS dataset containing both the PMA-treated and untreated samples to increase the available data to accommodate eukaryotic MAG assembly. In an effort to make strategy 2 completely independent from strategy 1, the process was rerun using the ANVIO tool from the very initial step of read trimming and filtering. The minimum contig length considered to be included in the data was 1000 bp. The merged profile database that was generated with the minimum contig length of 1000 contained 40,455 contigs, which corresponded to 100% of all contigs, and 100% of all nucleotides found in the contigs database generated during the process. Out of the 84 bins, four bins were classified into the eukaryotic domain. As per the minimum requirement for MAG, completeness should be ≥ 50%, and contamination should be ≤ 10% [41]. Two out of four genomes did not have the required 50% completeness, while the other two were subjected to genome refinement to reduce the redundancy below 10%. After genome evaluation with BUSCO, only four genome bins met the minimal standard for draft MAG, i.e., bins 7, 12, 60, and 73 (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Local phylogeny showing placement of the Bin7 MAG, based on a larger phylogeny embracing 145 Tremellomycetes taxa (class where members of the genus Naganishia in nested within). Position (in red) relative to its closest clade (in blue) is shownThe four fungal MAGs (Bin7, Bin12, Bin60, and Bin73) could be assigned to the species level by BLASTn searches plus Mash distance comparisons. Bin12 had four (among five) random genomic segments of 2000 bp matching Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (ATCC 58901) > 99.9% hit identity, and the remaining segment corresponding Rhodotorula sp. (CCFEE 5036). Bin12 Mash distance against the most complete assembly of this species (R. mucilaginosa IF1SW-B1, an ISS strain; GCA_013036955.1) was 0.0049, well below the 0.04 Mash distance threshold for k-mer sizes between 16 and 22 bp [32], and therefore confirming it as R. mucilaginosa (Table 2). Regarding Bin60, the five BLASTn searches matched Penicillium chrysogenum (genome Wisconsin 54-1255; GCA_000710275.1) with percent similarity in the range 98.4–99.95% for the five segments. Mash confirmed the species, with a distance value of 0.007 (Table 2). Regarding Bin73, the five BLASTn searches matched Papiliotrema laurentii 5307AH v1.0 with a low Mash distance which confirmed the species as P. laurentii and also showed high relationship with the genome of an ISS isolate IF7SW-B5 (GCA_012922625.1; Table 2). Regarding Bin7, BLASTn searches resulted in close matches to members of the Naganishia genus. Mash distance calculation against the six closest genomes of this genus (four Naganishia tulchinskyi and two Naganishia liquefaciens) showed that Bin7 can be assigned to species N. tulchinskyi (Table 2); for this bin, a phylogenetic analysis was also carried out confirming the N. tulchinskyi classification (Fig. 1). It is interesting to note that the “metagenome to phenome” approach applied for the bacterial MAGs also enabled the description of a novel yeast, N. tulchinskyi, from the ISS samples [42]. Table 2.

They are as follows: Acinetobacter pittii, E. bugandensis, K. piersonii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, M. ajmalii, and S. aureus. The BRIG analysis revealed relatively high levels of identity shared across genomes of the ISS isolates and MAGs, when compared against their type strain genomes (Fig. 2). Additionally, patterns of GC content for each bacterial species tested were highly similar to that of their respective type strain. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Comparisons of genome assemblies from isolates (purple) and MAGs (blue) against their respective type strains using BRIG. Innermost rings correspond to the pseudo-coordinates of the concatenated reference assemblies and their respective sliding GC content. Ordering of the blast comparisons of each of the assemblies is displayed for the isolates (purple, right) and MAGs (blue, left), ordered from innermost to outermost blast comparison ring. The outermost plot in each figure highlights annotations of relevant markers. Nucleotide identities generated by blastn are color coded for each assembly, with upper identity and lower identity cutoffs at 90% and 80%, respectively, and a minimum e-value of 1e-05. Comparative phylogenetic analysis reveals evolution The possible evolution in the ISS microorganisms was investigated with a careful species-by-species phylogenetic analysis. In this exercise, the following criteria were used: (i) ISS isolates, (ii) ISS MAGs, and (iii) at least one Earth-origin reference genome. The resulting candidate species genome data are shown in Supplementary Table S2, and they belong to K. piersonii, K. quasipneumoniae, P. brenneri, S. aureus, and S. saprophyticus. The phylogenetic analyses for those five species showed that ISS genomes (isolates and MAGs) are always monophyletic. This is already suggestive of ISS-specific evolution. For two of those trees (Kalamiella and Pantoea), there were not enough Earth-origin genomes available (Supplementary Fig. S2). With reference to the Staphylococcus aureus and K. quasipneumoniae phylogenetic analysis with core genes, the inferred tree contains two ISS clades (Fig. 3 A and C, respectively), suggesting in both cases at least two separate introductions from an Earth source. However, for S Staphylococcus saprophyticus, all ISS genomes were placed within a single clade (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of A S. aureus, B S. saprophyticus, and C Klebsiella quasipneumoniae. Clades in red contain only ISS genomesThe single-copy genes specific to either the ISS genomes or the Earth-origin genomes were checked and found none. Furthermore, mutation (indels and substitutions) analyses were carried out that were specific to the ISS clades. The amino acid substitutions that changed a hydrophobic amino acid into a hydrophilic one or vice versa were checked and found many changes. The genes affected by these changes were analyzed in terms of Gene Ontology classifications (Biological Process only; Supplementary Fig. S3). The two ISS-specific clades of the S. aureus tree allowed us to compare the two clades in terms of indels. There were 63 indels found to be shared by both clades of S. aureus, as opposed to 14 indels specific to clade 1 and 57 specific to clade 2. The GO analysis of the genes affected by the 63 shared indels resulted in 10 GO terms (Supplementary Fig. S4). Many of the GO terms with high frequency that resulted from these analyses are related to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape. This is consistent with previous reports regarding the effects of microgravity on cellular morphology, proliferation, and adhesion [43]. Taken together, the present results exhibit strong evidence for ISS-specific bacterial evolution. Gene-based functional analysis Variations in the AMR and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs have been summarized in Supplemental Table S1. Since multiple studies show that the microbial virulence increases in microgravity [44, 45], AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of type strains and ISS isolates [46, 47]. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the E. bugandensis F1-2P MAG, whereas these were not present in the other MAGs of BSL-2 microorganisms studied during this study. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in the ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. Comparative analyses of MAG and WGS of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to microbial evolution under microgravity. Among 20 MAGs processed, 13 AMR genes were found to be the most prominent among the bacteria (Table 3). These 13 genes were housekeeping genes and have a unique, specialized role determined by their protein type and function. For example, the LSU ribosomal unit is the primary site where protein synthesis occurs in the translation process. Other genes include copper translocating P-type ATPase, DNA gyrase subunits A and B, LSU ribosomal unit 20p and 35p, SSU ribosomal unit 7p, and 12p, DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta subunit, topoisomerase IV subunits A and B, translation initiation factor 3, translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and translation elongation factor G (EF-G). Functions of genes characterized during this study are given in Supplemental Table S2. Single-nucleotide variation (SNV) among these 13 housekeeping genes in MAGs of six different bacterial species are summarized below. Table 3.

The subsystem features include genes responsible for various metabolisms, in which genes responsible for carbohydrates and amino acids metabolism were high. Genes related to motility and chemotaxis were absent in the members of the genera Acinetobacter, Kocuria, Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella. In contrast, genes associated with stress response were present in high numbers (90 to 167 genes) within members of family Enterobacteriaceae, whereas such genes were less abundant (19 to 75 genes) with Staphylococcus and actinobacterial species. Similarly, sporulation and dormancy genes were mainly present in Paenibacillus polymyxa, since they are the only spore-forming bacterium MAG found. Table 4.

Likewise, MAGs of Pseudomonas brenneri (F1-5P and F2-5P) and Pantoea dispersa (F3-4P) had positional variation compared to their type strains (LMG 24534T and DSM 30073T, respectively). In contrast, no sequence variation in the copper translocating P-type ATPase was noticed when analyzing the WGS of the S. aureus ATCC12600T type strain, a nosocomial isolate, and S. aureus MAGs (F1-4P and F2-8P). Similarly, K. pneumoniae MAG F3-3P had no SNVs compared to its type strain ATCC 13883T. Acinetobacter pittii F2-1P MAG had maximum similarity of copper translocating P-type ATPase sequence with not only its type strain DSM 25618T but also with Acinetobacter baumannii DSM 30007T which was isolated from human urine. WGS of the novel species K. piersonii, whose type strain IIIF1SW-P2T was also isolated from location no. 1 of the ISS [7], was compared with the MAGs (F3-1P, F3-5P, F3-7P, and F3-8P). This comparison exhibited the same genetic composition, which confirms that the MAGs might have originated from the living cells. In addition, the comparative genomic analysis of the uropathogenic strain of K. piersonii strain YU22, isolated from human urine [48], revealed no SNVs.DNA gyrase subunit A To observe positional sequence variation in the DNA gyrase subunit A, S. aureus MAG F2-8P was compared with the genomes of the type strain ATCC 12600T, isolated from pleural fluid, and most SNPs were found. However, S. aureus MAG F1-4P was highly homologous with the type strain ATCC 12600T. In addition, S. aureus MAG F2-8P and AR071, a nosocomial strain that is part of the FDA/CDC AMR bank, also showed mutations. Similarly, E. bugandensis F1-2P had SNPs found in its counterpart type strain EB-247T. A. pittii had alignment differences in strain A. pittii XJ88, which was found in human sputum which is a mixture of saliva and mucus. P. brenneri MAGs (F1-5P and F2-5P) as well as K. personii MAGs (F3-5P, F3-8P, and F3-7P) have SNPs with its type strain. The remainder of the Pantoea strains was found to have scattered SNPs among Earth homologs. In contrast, K. quasipneumoniae MAG F1-2P had no SNPs found with its type strain 01A030T, a human blood isolate. K. pneumoniae MAG F3-3P had nucleotide differences with NCTC 11357 sequences.DNA gyrase subunit B S. aureus MAGs (F1-4P and F2-8P) had SNPs in S. aureus ATCC12600T. E. bugandensis MAG F1-2P has SNPs found in E. quasihormaechei WCHes120003T which was isolated from a human sputum [49] and its type strain as well. A. pittii had many scattered SNPs among the Earth homolog. K. pneumoniae MAG F3-3P did not have distinct point mutations.DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta subunit S. aureus MAGs (F1-4P and F2-8P) have SNPs found in ATCC 12600, which has already been explained to be a nosocomial strain. E. bugandensis F1-2P and Earth homolog Enterobacter cloacae complex C45, isolated from a hospital, have point mutations. K. pneumoniae F3-3P had SNPs found in K. pneumoniae NCTC 9170. P. dispersa F3-4P was the only strain that had scattered SNPs in the Pantoea species. Acinetobacter alignment had SNPs found in Acinetobacter sp. genomospecies 3 ATCC 19004 which was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.LSU ribosomal protein L20p S. aureus F1-4P and F2-8P MAGs had no SNPs with the type strain. Strain S. aureus GD1108 which is a hospital strain is the same as that of ISS F1-4P and F2-8P MAGs. S. aureus F2-8P ISS strain was very dissimilar to the rest of the S. aureus MAG sequences. Both E. bugandensis and Klebsiella MAGs have no SNPs. The Pantoea MAGs have SNPs found in Plautia stali (insect) symbiont, P. vagans C9-1, and P. stewartii DC 283. One SNP was found in strain XJ88 in the Acinetobacter (F2-1P) alignment.LSU ribosomal protein L35p No SNPs were found in all S. aureus strains.

A. pittii MAG was extremely different from the rest of the alignment. E. bugandensis F1-2P had scattered SNPs. K. pneumoniae F3-3P had SNPs found in strain ATCC 700603. P. brenneri F2-5P and K. piersonii F3-1P had SNPs found in P. agglomerans FDAARGOS 160 which was isolated from a human wound isolation source.

A. pittii F2-1P had SNPs found in IEC338SC which was isolated from a trachea excretion.Translation initiation factor 3 S. aureus MAG F1-4P have had sequences that were very different from its Earth homologs, but there were no SNPs were found in S. aureus F2-8P MAG. K. piersonii F3-8P had scattered SNPs, whereas MAG F3-7P and P. dispersa F3-4P have SNPs in Plautia stali symbiont which was collected from the midgut of an insect. All other Pantoea MAGs do not have SNPs. The A. pittii alignment was found to have SNPs in the strain 201406 which was isolated from human.

E. bugandensis F1-1P has SNPs in Enterobacter MBRL1077 which was isolated from a human wound. SNPs were not particular to one Klebsiella strain. K. piersonii MAGs (F3-1P, F3-5P, F3-7P, and F3-8P) and P. dispersa F3-4P have SNPs with their respective type strains. There were no SNPs found in K. pneumoniae F3-3P, but SNPs were found in A. pittii F2-1P with strain ST220 which was retrieved from sputum. P. brenneri F2-5P has no SNPs.Translation elongation factor Tu S. aureus F2-8P had SNPs found in strain AR071, and the rest of the S. aureus F1-4P MAG has SNPs in ATCC 12600. E. bugandensis F1-2P had scattered SNPs, but Klebsiella strains have no SNPs. P. brenneri F2-5P and K. piersonii MAGs (F3-1P and F3-7P) have SNPs when compared to the type strain. K. piersonii F3-5P had SNPs found in Pantoea stewartii strain DC283, whereas K. piersonii MAG F3-8P did not have any SNPs. P. dispersa MAG F3-4P has SNPs in Pantoea rwandensis strain ND04. A. pittii was extremely dissimilar to its type strain. Many SNPs found in these 333 alignments have been found in the Earth homologs. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the most SNPs found within the ISS strain. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. More epigenetic and chemical analyses are needed to understand why members of these species are particularly sensitive to these conditions. The difference may also lie in the low percent identity the Earth homologs had. In regards to the Staphylococcus strains, ATCC12600 and GD1108 are both nosocomial strains which seem to act differently in each gene. For example, in some genes, ATCC12600 exhibits SNPs, while GD1108 is the only Earth homolog that has the exact same sequence as the ISS strain. Strain GD1108 was isolated from a school child from a prevalence survey in 2011 in Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China [50]. Common SNPs were not found between the ISS and homolog strains within alignments. SNPs in Earth homologs symbolize differences in where the strain was found from. For example, Earth homologs that are found in soil exhibit very different sequences with the ISS strain, therefore explaining the SNPs. In addition, most SNPs have been found in human fluids as well as soil/plants with a few animal excretions. This demonstrates that the ISS strain has some nosocomial/soil background in relation to the rest of the alignment. Strains that are similar/dissimilar to the ISS strain show no common isolation source for the most part. Therefore, more biochemical analyses on the molecular level are needed. In MAG gene analysis (Supplemental Table S1), it was observed that similar genes were responsible for antibiotic resistance and virulence. This common gene-based resistant phenomenon suggests that changes are an adaptation strategy in microbes. Genes related to biofilm characteristics Biofilm forming and quorum-sensing (QS) genes analyzed in this study and their predicted functions are tabulated in Supplemental Table S2. Sequences of all four E. bungandensis ISS strains and the MAG (F1-2P) exhibited 100% sequence similarities among them for the genes responsible for biofilm (pgaABCD) and QS (LsrABCD, LsrR, LsrK, and AI-LuxS) functions. The variable residues (SNPs) of genes related to biofilm formation and QS-related genes in E. bungandensis MAG when compared to E. bugandensis strains (n = 11) isolated from clinical samples are given in Table 5. The comparative sequence analysis of E. bugandensis MAG shows that the biofilm and QS genes are highly conserved (< 1% SNPs variation) across most of the clinical strains of E. bugandensis (n = 10). This pattern is also consistent with the neighbor-joining tree of each one of these genes for all the strains tested and one MAG (data not shown). These analyses confirmed that E. bugandensis strains might have hitch-hiked with the healthy crew and landed on ISS surfaces. In contrast, the sequence variation of all biofilm and QS genes of E. bugandensis strain MBRL 1077 was highly variable (2.4 to 25%). The average nucleic acid index (ANI) of MBRL 1077 and the E. bugandensis type strain EB-247 were ~95%, whereas the ANI was > 99% for the other 10 clinical strains, four ISS isolates, and one MAG. The higher SNPs and lower ANI values of MBRL 1077 strain with all other 14 strains and one MAG suggested that MBRL 1077 might not belong to E. bugandensis. Table 5.

This result is interesting because this gene codes for the autoinducer proteins which are very important for carrying signals [51]. In that regard, environmental stress would have no effect on that gene since a change in the gene sequence would not serve to increase the rate of biofilm production and increase the overall amount of biofilm formed, but we can also see that there is a decent amount of amino acid change in the LsrC gene which is responsible for importing the autoinducer, and this makes sense because while the autoinducer itself does not need to be changed, the rate at which it is imported to carry information needs to be increased or reduced to accommodate for the change in the amount of biofilm produced. On the other hand, changes in the nucleotide sequence of the pgaA and pgaB genes, along with the LsrK gene, lead to high amino acid change. This could serve as a strong indication of these organisms trying to adjust to the environmental stress because the pgaA and pgaB are responsible for transporting the PGA essential in the movement of adhesin out of the periplasm to form the biofilm. Also, the LsrK is responsible for repressing the LsrR repressor, and increasing the function of all three genes will aid in increased signal for biofilm to be formed faster, as well as increase the rate of biofilm formation.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusion In summary, good quality bacterial and fungal MAGs were generated from ISS environmental samples, and functional properties were predicted. Furthermore, it was possible to describe novel microbial (two bacterial and one yeast) species via the “metagenome to phenome” approach. The monophyletic phylogeny exhibited by the ISS genomes (both isolates and MAGs) suggested that they shared a single common ancestor. The molecules pertaining to the cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were in high frequency in ISS genomes demonstrating evidence for ISS-specific bacterial evolution. The common gene-based resistance phenomenon noticed in this study suggests that SNP changes in MAGs and ISS genomes might be an adaptation strategy in AMR and biofilm formation in microbes. Similarly, variations found in the AMR and virulence genes enabled the prediction of the ecology and evolution of microorganisms in space. The maximum SNPs characterized for the ISS Pantoea/Kalamiella strains suggested that enterobacterial species are much more subjective to microgravity changes. However, fixation of environmental samples in space for RNAseq approach and/or in situ sequencing in space are warranted to confirm variation related to microbial evolution under microgravity. More studies are needed to unearth whether SNPs seen in ISS MAGs are due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.",

Copyright notice ID: 10233975 PMID: 37264385 Abstract Background Several investigations on the microbial diversity and functional properties of the International Space Station (ISS) environment were carried out to understand the influence of spaceflight conditions on the microbial population. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence characteristics.Results In total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii) and one novel bacterial species (Methylobacterium ajmalii). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.Conclusions Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here on Earth.

When a MAG is assembled, annotation and interpretation of genes are possible, allowing researchers to better understand the metabolic potential of the microbe, including its potential resistance to antibiotics, interactions with other microbes in the microbial community, and association with a host [3]. MAGs have been successfully used to discover uncultivated species [4], candidatus organisms like Candidatus Amarolinea aalborgensis gen. nov., sp. nov. [5], and novel genera like Spiribacter [6] and Kalamiella [7]. MAGs have also been used to recover genomic clusters of secondary metabolites [8], genetic mobility [4], metabolic pathways [9], and in situ replication [10]. Projects retrieving thousands of MAGs have also been documented to understand yet-to-be cultured microbiomes of cow rumens and other environmental samples [11]. In addition, MAGs have revealed new microbial phyla, which have expanded the tree of life [12]. Lowering sequencing cost, curated data availability in public database, and advances in computational biology have made assembling MAGs from complex and extreme environments easy. A higher number of reference genomes makes the binning easier and more reliable. Multiple best practices are available to construct accurate and complete genomes from metagenomes, but high-quality MAGs are still relatively rare. Most MAGs reported in many MAG-related papers have completeness levels between 50 and 60% [13]. Recently, MAGs generated from International Space Station (ISS) environmental metagenomes paved a way to describe a novel genus and species, Kalamiella piersonii [7]. We have retrieved four K. piersonii MAGs (100% genome sequence identity) from ISS environmental metagenomes that allowed us to identify a cultivated isolate archived from the same samples using gene-specific assays [7]. This “genome to phenome” approach enabled the differentiation of closely related genera Pantoea from Kalamiella and facilitated the isolation of several ISS strains (n = 7) that were archived and previously unidentified [7]. Furthermore, the use of MAGs and whole-genome sequences (WGS) of biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from three consecutive samplings of the ISS at eight defined locations made it possible to track the source of the original BSL-2 strain and understand the succession, persistence, and spread of this opportunistic pathogen detected in the ISS [14]. The objectives of this study were to retrieve near full-length genomes from metagenomes generated from ISS environmental samples and perform in-depth functional and phylogenetic analyses. Among 46 MAGs generated during this study, functional analyses such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence characteristic, and metabolic traits/stress responses were carried out for 20 prokaryotic MAGs. In addition to the prokaryotic MAGs (~85% completeness), this is the first-time eukaryotic MAGs (~50% completeness) were also generated from ISS metagenomes using the co-assembly strategy.Material and methods Data source and sample description Data used for this study were acquired from the  () Short Read Archive under the bio-project number PRJNA438545. A detailed description of shotgun metagenome sequencing and ISS locations sampled were published elsewhere [14]. In this research communication, we utilized shotgun metagenome reads generated from the propidium monoazide (PMA)-treated samples only [15] to understand whether these MAGs were stemming from the viable and intact cells. However, for eukaryotic analysis, we used shotgun metagenome reads from both PMA and non-PMA-treated samples.Metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes Paired-end 100-bp metagenomic reads were processed with Trimmomatic [16] to remove adapter sequences and low-quality ends, with a minimum Phred score of 20 across the entire length of the read used as a quality cutoff. Reads shorter than 80 bp were removed after trimming. The remaining high-quality reads were subsequently assembled using metaSPAdes [17]. Contigs were binned using Metabat2 [v. 2.11.3] [18]. Recovered genomes were evaluated with CheckM [19], and a recovered genome was considered good with ~85% completeness and at most 10% contamination. Each genome was subsequently annotated with the help of Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST), and taxonomic identifications and phylogenetic affiliations were predicted [20]. In addition to running the procedure above, we also ran the metaWRAP pipeline on the same datasets, using default parameters [21]. In order to test for assemblies suspected to be the same among the 20 metaSPAdes genomes and the set of genomes obtained using metaWRAP for the same set of reads (“meta-set”), we compared both assembly sets using Mash [22] distances. Then, we kept only the best MAG under a Mash distance < = 0.05 (corresponds to average nucleotide identity, ANI > = 95%). After gathering the relevant reference genomes and MAGs, Amphora2 [23] was employed to retrieve a protein set composed of 31 universal bacterial markers, which were then aligned by Muscle [24]. Finally, a phylogeny was inferred by maximum likelihood using the concatenated dataset under IQTREE [25] with a concomitant search for the best evolutionary protein model. For each sample, our final list of bacterial MAGs contains only those MAGs that were considered distinct from one another. When two MAGs were considered “the same” for a given sample, we chose the metaSPAdes version.Phylogenetic comparison of the ISS bacterial MAGs obtained by the two methods MAGs assembled from the ISS dataset by two methods (metaSPAdes metaWRAP) were tested for the phylogenetic clustering within the same species clade. All assemblies from both methods were positioned according to the most exclusive clade in the Bacteria Tree of Life to which individual Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) classifications matched (e.g., the most exclusive taxonomic group containing Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Paenibacillus would be Bacillales). After defining such taxonomic groups, a new phylogeny was estimated for each of them. Besides the reconstructed genomes themselves, for each supposed species, we also added three reference genomes from  of the same species (picked sparsely and randomly from its automatically generated species dendrogram tree) while also including two/three other species from the same genus (at least a close species and a not too distant one), each of them being represented by three sparse genomes in their respective species dendrograms. Such an analysis is liberal enough to indicate whether different assemblies from the same reads would indeed cluster together.Metagenome-assembled fungal genomes One of the main focus of this study was assembling eukaryotic genomes from the ISS metagenome. When tools to construct prokaryotic MAGs were used, eukaryotic MAGs were low quality, and results were not satisfactory to identify them as fungal genomes. Additionally, the availability of reference data falls short for eukaryotic genome assembly. To overcome this, we used a completely independent co-assembly-based strategy in the tool ANVIO [18] on the complete ISS dataset using PMA-treated and untreated samples. All the steps were followed as per the step-by-step metagenomic procedure available on the ANVIO website (http://merenlab.org/2016/06/22/anvio-tutorial-v2/). In short, quality filtering was carried out using the script iu-filter-quality-minoche. MEGAHIT [26]-based co-assembly was performed on the quality-filtered reads from the 42 samples. Names in the co-assembled fasta file were simplified using the script anvi-script-reformat-fasta. A contig database was generated using “anvi-gen-contigs-database.” The contig database was run through hidden Markov models (HMM) based HMMER [27].  – COG was used to identify the genes in the co-assembly fasta files. Individual profiles were generated for each sample using anvi-profile and anvi-merge to cluster all the profiles using Euclidean distance and Ward’s linkage algorithm. Final results of co-assembly bins in ANVIO tools were interactively visualized using anvi-interactive. All ANVIO results were exported in the summary format for further downstream processing. Each bin generated in ANVIO profiles was treated as an individual genome, and quality was assessed using CheckM. To establish the taxonomic identification of each bin, they were further subjected to GTDB-Tk (Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit) [28]. All the bins were compared with 24,706 genomes constituting 8792 validly published bacterial species (https://www.bacterio.net/). GTDB-Tk can only identify prokaryotic genomes; hence, all the bins not defined by the GTDB-Tk were considered as eukaryotic taxa and further manually curated for genomic identification. Determining the closest fungal species to each MAG was carried out in three steps. First, we used BLASTn to search GenBank, aimed at circumscribing the innermost taxonomic rank quickly (e.g., genus if multiple species within that genus were found across different BLAST hits or family if different genera within the family are found in the BLAST hits). For this search, five different BLASTn searches were performed per MAG. For each such BLASTn search, a random genomic segment of 2000 bp was chosen while also certifying that this segment is within a minimum of 1000 bp from its respective contig end (to minimize possible assembly issues that are more prevalent at contig edges). Secondly, for those MAGs whose BLAST results were not hitting a single species, phylogenomic analysis was employed with all assemblies/genomes within that innermost rank (as described above) found in either GenBank or Joint Genome Institute (JGI) MycoCosm (with at most three genomes per species). A set of 758 conserved proteins across fungi, available from the BUSCO pipeline [29] (database: fungi_odb10), were sought in every assembly. Because there can be differences in the number of BUSCO genes found per genome, due to variation in assembly completeness, we built a subset of the dataset where each protein is present in at least 1/3 of the MAGs, reference genomes, and two previously chosen outgroups (Ustilago maydis and Dacryopinax primogenitus) used for proper rooting of the phylogeny. Multiple alignments per gene were carried out using Mafft [30]. Two alternative species tree inference analyses were performed, one IQ, and another inference done by Astral [31], which is based on an amalgamation of quartet trees sampled from each individual gene tree (where each of the 758 gene trees had been previously estimated in IQ-TREE). Thirdly, Mash distances [22] were computed to confirm the species (either MAGs that went through phylogenomic analyses or MAGs assigned to a single species in the first BLASTn step). According to Gostinčar [32], a Mash distance below 0.04 is sufficient to assign any two fungal genomes to the same species for k-mer sizes between 16 and 22 bp [32].Comparative phylogenetic analysis In order to include a background of Earth-origin genomes to anchor ISS genomes, and therefore pinpoint where in the phylogeny of ISS microorganisms evolved from, we searched in GenBank for genomes of Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Kalamiella piersonii, and Pantoea brenneri. When available, two genomes of each species per year were retrieved and used in the analysis. Get_Homologues [33] was used to cluster protein-coding genes into gene families. Unicopy genes (i.e., genes with a single copy in every included genome of the species) were then retrieved to build the phylogenetic trees per species and to further assess amino acid changes. Mafft [30] with default parameters was used to obtain multiple alignments for each gene family. Alignments were then concatenated into a supermatrix using FASconCat [34]. IQ-TREE [25] was used to infer the phylogeny from this supermatrix, using a LG + I + G model and 1000 ultra-fast bootstraps to assess branch support. In-house python scripts were used to annotate amino acid substitutions and indels (i.e., events of either insertion or deletion of amino acids). Pannzer 2 [35] was used to gather GO information (minimum query and subject cover of 80%, minimum alignment length of 50 aa; other parameters as default) for all genes having amino acid point substitutions that changed hydrophobicity (i.e., from hydrophobic to hydrophilic or vice versa). Such substitutions are more susceptible of being under natural selection, because they have a higher probability of having an impact on the three-dimensional protein structure.Comparative functional analysis Genome assemblies and associated RefSeq annotations for each strain were downloaded from ’s RefSeq database. Due to their exclusion from the RefSeq database, the meta-genome-assembled genomes (MAGs) assemblies and associated annotations were downloaded from their original GenBank accessions. For each of the species of interest in this study, representative type strains were selected for comparison. To compare nucleotide-level identities for each of the analyzed genomes against their respective type strains, BLASTn (−evalue 1e-05) alignments were conducted and visualized with BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG), version 0.95 [36]. BLASTn identities were color coded according to the origin of the genome assembly for ISS isolates (purple) or MAGs (blue), with the intensity of their color corresponding to custom percent identity cutoffs (high: 90%, lower: 80%, minimum: 50%). To assess the completeness of each assembly, the open reading frames (ORFs) of 13 housekeeping genes were identified for each species reference genome using keyword searches of the feature_table.txt file included with each assembly: DNA gyrase subunit A (gyrA), DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB), 50S ribosomal protein L35 (rpmI), 50S ribosomal protein L20 (rplT), 30S ribosomal protein S12 (rpsL), 30S ribosomal protein S7 (rpsG), DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta (rpoB), DNA topoisomerase IV subunit A (parC), DNA topoisomerase IV subunit B (parE), translation initiation factor IF-3 (infC), elongation factor Tu (tuf), elongation factor G (fusA), and cation translocating P-type ATPase (mgtA, zntA, actP, cadA, copB). Of note, to render MAGs with multiple contigs, BRIG orders each contig into a contiguous assembly to be displayed as a single circular chromosome, causing contig-relative start and end coordinates provided in the assembly feature_table.txt file to not necessarily match the absolute coordinates generated by BRIG. Thus, a custom code was written to transpose the housekeeping genes’ contig-relative start and end coordinates into the absolute coordinates assigned by BRIG. These absolute ORF coordinates were then used as annotations to display on the reference genome on the outermost layer of each BRIG figure. The associated code used to identify these features and convert their coordinates can be found here: https://github.com/jlombo96/MAG_2023_Code.Gene-based AMR and biofilm study Selected genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation were studied. AMR genes were selected based on the abundance in various MAGs, while E. bugandensis MAG was chosen for biofilm formation based on the previously reported studies [37]. All AMR gene sequences found in the 20 annotated MAGs were tabulated for comparative analysis. Genes include DNA gyrase and LSU and SSU ribosomal protein units. All identified genes were put into  Nucleotide BLAST (RefSeq), and the top hits with ≥ 98% identity cutoff were compiled in a fasta text file for analysis using MEGA 7 [38]. The genes were aligned using ClusterW, and the Neighbor-Joining algorithm was used to make phylogenetic trees. Nosocomial (hospital/Earth) strains were used for comparison to the MAGs since AMR has been reported to increase under microgravity [14]. The  database was used to derive WGS of E. bugandensis. DSMZ and LPSN were used to determine the type strains. Identified strains of E. bugandensis were analyzed using the IMG JGI database and used to search for biofilm-forming genes (pgaA, pgaB, pgaC, pgaD) and quorum-sensing genes (LsrK, LsrA, AI-2 luxS, LsrF, LsrB, LsrC, LsrD, LsrG, LsrR). All gene sequences were downloaded as a fasta file per strain for downstream alignment analysis. All downloaded fasta sequences for the biofilm and quorum-sensing genes of all the E. bugandensis (n = 15 + 1MAG) of interest were used for phylogenetic analysis with the MEGA7 software package. The downloaded fasta sequence for each gene (n = 13) in the E. bugandensis strains was aligned, conserved sites within that specific gene were observed across all strains versus the ISS isolates, and the variable sites were also observed and quantified for that particular gene. All areas of interest in the aligned sequences were highlighted and observed for nucleotide differences in each of the 16 strains that are different from that of the EB-247T, which is the type strain of the genus. The position of the nucleotide change in the codon was observed to see if it is in the first, second, or third position to determine if it would lead to a synonymous mutation or a new amino acid formation. MEGA7 software using the aligned gene sequence was used to create a neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree for each gene with the bootstrap data set at 1000.Results and discussion Metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes Out of the 42 ISS metagenomes submitted at , only PMA-treated metagenomes (n = 21) representing the viable/intact cells were used for generating bacterial MAGs. Characteristics of MAGs (n = 46) such as genome size (2.6 to 6.6 Mb), completeness, contamination percentage, the average mean coverage, number of scaffolds, and N50 (5 to 670 Kb) were calculated using CheckM, and assembly statistics are summarized in Table 1. Sample collection date, location, relative humidity, radiation exposure, etc. are given in Table 1, and various other details such as materials of the location and partial pressure have already been published [14, 15]. A bacterial MAG was considered acceptable during this study if CheckM completeness was more than 85% and contamination was less than 10%. When metaSPAdes was used, 20 MAGs were recovered, and housekeeping genes were used to confirm the identity, contamination, and completeness of MAGs. In addition, when metaWRAP was used, 26 MAGs were assembled from the same 21 PMA-treated ISS environmental metagenomes. When metaSPAdes and metaWRAP pipelines generated MAGs were compared, a total of 16 one-to-one matches were detected between them, suggesting these two different assembly strategies identified the identical genomes. Among the metaWRAP-assembled genomes, 11 MAGs had smaller genome sizes, which may be due to the more conservative nature of the metaWRAP procedure. The correlation between metaSPAde (20 MAGs) and metaWRAP (26 MAGs) is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 (R2 was 0.85). Table 1.

[37] bTEPC US tissue equivalent proportional counter Species assignment analysis of ISS bacterial MAGs Phylogenetic analysis of 30 unique bacterial MAGs of 46 generated showed 18 species (Table 1). The bacterial species identity was based on the average nucleotide index (ANI; > 95%) of MAGs compared with the corresponding type strain. The majority of the MAGs (22 out of 46) belonged to the members of the order Enterobacterales and matched with six established enterobacterial species. In addition, MAGs from spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus 1 MAG; Paenibacillus 4 MAGs); human skin microbes, e.g., Staphylococcus (8 MAGs); and actinobacterial (4 MAGs) members were retrieved. However, 11 MAGs were not identified to any of the genomes of well-established bacterial species. Subsequently, the gyrB gene [39] sequences were pulled from the MAGs and screened with sequences of a large number of ISS isolates (n = 500 strains) archived in our culture collection. The ISS strains that exhibited the highest gyrB sequence similarity (> 95%) were further sequenced for the whole genome and compared with the above 11 MAGs. This “metagenome to phenome” approach has enabled the description of one novel genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii; 8 MAGs; Singh et al., [7]) and another novel bacterial species, Methylobacterium ajmalii (n = 3 MAGs; Bijlani et al., 2021). Interestingly, Sphingomonadaceae MAGs retrieved from F2-7P samples that matched with yet to be identified Sphingomonas sp. K11 strain genome (GenBank no. CP013916.1) also matched with the WGS of three ISS strains isolated from the same location (flight no. 2, location no. 7). These were identified as Sphingomonas sanguinis, and functional characteristics were established, and production of plant growth-promoting substances was identified [40].Metagenome-assembled fungal genomes Conventional tools for MAG assembly are historically not meant for eukaryotic MAG assembly (strategy 1). Additionally, the sequencing depth requirement for eukaryotic MAG assembly is much higher compared to the prokaryotic genomes. We used a co-assembly-based analysis (strategy 2), using the tool ANVIO [18] on the complete ISS dataset containing both the PMA-treated and untreated samples to increase the available data to accommodate eukaryotic MAG assembly. In an effort to make strategy 2 completely independent from strategy 1, the process was rerun using the ANVIO tool from the very initial step of read trimming and filtering. The minimum contig length considered to be included in the data was 1000 bp. The merged profile database that was generated with the minimum contig length of 1000 contained 40,455 contigs, which corresponded to 100% of all contigs, and 100% of all nucleotides found in the contigs database generated during the process. Out of the 84 bins, four bins were classified into the eukaryotic domain. As per the minimum requirement for MAG, completeness should be ≥ 50%, and contamination should be ≤ 10% [41]. Two out of four genomes did not have the required 50% completeness, while the other two were subjected to genome refinement to reduce the redundancy below 10%. After genome evaluation with BUSCO, only four genome bins met the minimal standard for draft MAG, i.e., bins 7, 12, 60, and 73 (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Local phylogeny showing placement of the Bin7 MAG, based on a larger phylogeny embracing 145 Tremellomycetes taxa (class where members of the genus Naganishia in nested within). Position (in red) relative to its closest clade (in blue) is shownThe four fungal MAGs (Bin7, Bin12, Bin60, and Bin73) could be assigned to the species level by BLASTn searches plus Mash distance comparisons. Bin12 had four (among five) random genomic segments of 2000 bp matching Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (ATCC 58901) > 99.9% hit identity, and the remaining segment corresponding Rhodotorula sp. (CCFEE 5036). Bin12 Mash distance against the most complete assembly of this species (R. mucilaginosa IF1SW-B1, an ISS strain; GCA_013036955.1) was 0.0049, well below the 0.04 Mash distance threshold for k-mer sizes between 16 and 22 bp [32], and therefore confirming it as R. mucilaginosa (Table 2). Regarding Bin60, the five BLASTn searches matched Penicillium chrysogenum (genome Wisconsin 54-1255; GCA_000710275.1) with percent similarity in the range 98.4–99.95% for the five segments. Mash confirmed the species, with a distance value of 0.007 (Table 2). Regarding Bin73, the five BLASTn searches matched Papiliotrema laurentii 5307AH v1.0 with a low Mash distance which confirmed the species as P. laurentii and also showed high relationship with the genome of an ISS isolate IF7SW-B5 (GCA_012922625.1; Table 2). Regarding Bin7, BLASTn searches resulted in close matches to members of the Naganishia genus. Mash distance calculation against the six closest genomes of this genus (four Naganishia tulchinskyi and two Naganishia liquefaciens) showed that Bin7 can be assigned to species N. tulchinskyi (Table 2); for this bin, a phylogenetic analysis was also carried out confirming the N. tulchinskyi classification (Fig. 1). It is interesting to note that the “metagenome to phenome” approach applied for the bacterial MAGs also enabled the description of a novel yeast, N. tulchinskyi, from the ISS samples [42]. Table 2.

They are as follows: Acinetobacter pittii, E. bugandensis, K. piersonii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, M. ajmalii, and S. aureus. The BRIG analysis revealed relatively high levels of identity shared across genomes of the ISS isolates and MAGs, when compared against their type strain genomes (Fig. 2). Additionally, patterns of GC content for each bacterial species tested were highly similar to that of their respective type strain. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Comparisons of genome assemblies from isolates (purple) and MAGs (blue) against their respective type strains using BRIG. Innermost rings correspond to the pseudo-coordinates of the concatenated reference assemblies and their respective sliding GC content. Ordering of the blast comparisons of each of the assemblies is displayed for the isolates (purple, right) and MAGs (blue, left), ordered from innermost to outermost blast comparison ring. The outermost plot in each figure highlights annotations of relevant markers. Nucleotide identities generated by blastn are color coded for each assembly, with upper identity and lower identity cutoffs at 90% and 80%, respectively, and a minimum e-value of 1e-05.Comparative phylogenetic analysis reveals evolution The possible evolution in the ISS microorganisms was investigated with a careful species-by-species phylogenetic analysis. In this exercise, the following criteria were used: (i) ISS isolates, (ii) ISS MAGs, and (iii) at least one Earth-origin reference genome. The resulting candidate species genome data are shown in Supplementary Table S2, and they belong to K. piersonii, K. quasipneumoniae, P. brenneri, S. aureus, and S. saprophyticus. The phylogenetic analyses for those five species showed that ISS genomes (isolates and MAGs) are always monophyletic. This is already suggestive of ISS-specific evolution. For two of those trees (Kalamiella and Pantoea), there were not enough Earth-origin genomes available (Supplementary Fig. S2). With reference to the Staphylococcus aureus and K. quasipneumoniae phylogenetic analysis with core genes, the inferred tree contains two ISS clades (Fig. 3 A and C, respectively), suggesting in both cases at least two separate introductions from an Earth source. However, for S Staphylococcus saprophyticus, all ISS genomes were placed within a single clade (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of A S. aureus, B S. saprophyticus, and C Klebsiella quasipneumoniae. Clades in red contain only ISS genomesThe single-copy genes specific to either the ISS genomes or the Earth-origin genomes were checked and found none. Furthermore, mutation (indels and substitutions) analyses were carried out that were specific to the ISS clades. The amino acid substitutions that changed a hydrophobic amino acid into a hydrophilic one or vice versa were checked and found many changes. The genes affected by these changes were analyzed in terms of Gene Ontology classifications (Biological Process only; Supplementary Fig. S3). The two ISS-specific clades of the S. aureus tree allowed us to compare the two clades in terms of indels. There were 63 indels found to be shared by both clades of S. aureus, as opposed to 14 indels specific to clade 1 and 57 specific to clade 2. The GO analysis of the genes affected by the 63 shared indels resulted in 10 GO terms (Supplementary Fig. S4). Many of the GO terms with high frequency that resulted from these analyses are related to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape. This is consistent with previous reports regarding the effects of microgravity on cellular morphology, proliferation, and adhesion [43]. Taken together, the present results exhibit strong evidence for ISS-specific bacterial evolution.Gene-based functional analysis Variations in the AMR and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs have been summarized in Supplemental Table S1. Since multiple studies show that the microbial virulence increases in microgravity [44, 45], AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of type strains and ISS isolates [46, 47]. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the E. bugandensis F1-2P MAG, whereas these were not present in the other MAGs of BSL-2 microorganisms studied during this study. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in the ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. Comparative analyses of MAG and WGS of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to microbial evolution under microgravity. Among 20 MAGs processed, 13 AMR genes were found to be the most prominent among the bacteria (Table 3). These 13 genes were housekeeping genes and have a unique, specialized role determined by their protein type and function. For example, the LSU ribosomal unit is the primary site where protein synthesis occurs in the translation process. Other genes include copper translocating P-type ATPase, DNA gyrase subunits A and B, LSU ribosomal unit 20p and 35p, SSU ribosomal unit 7p, and 12p, DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta subunit, topoisomerase IV subunits A and B, translation initiation factor 3, translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and translation elongation factor G (EF-G). Functions of genes characterized during this study are given in Supplemental Table S2. Single-nucleotide variation (SNV) among these 13 housekeeping genes in MAGs of six different bacterial species are summarized below. Table 3.

The subsystem features include genes responsible for various metabolisms, in which genes responsible for carbohydrates and amino acids metabolism were high. Genes related to motility and chemotaxis were absent in the members of the genera Acinetobacter, Kocuria, Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella. In contrast, genes associated with stress response were present in high numbers (90 to 167 genes) within members of family Enterobacteriaceae, whereas such genes were less abundant (19 to 75 genes) with Staphylococcus and actinobacterial species. Similarly, sporulation and dormancy genes were mainly present in Paenibacillus polymyxa, since they are the only spore-forming bacterium MAG found. Table 4.

Likewise, MAGs of Pseudomonas brenneri (F1-5P and F2-5P) and Pantoea dispersa (F3-4P) had positional variation compared to their type strains (LMG 24534T and DSM 30073T, respectively). In contrast, no sequence variation in the copper translocating P-type ATPase was noticed when analyzing the WGS of the S. aureus ATCC12600T type strain, a nosocomial isolate, and S. aureus MAGs (F1-4P and F2-8P). Similarly, K. pneumoniae MAG F3-3P had no SNVs compared to its type strain ATCC 13883T. Acinetobacter pittii F2-1P MAG had maximum similarity of copper translocating P-type ATPase sequence with not only its type strain DSM 25618T but also with Acinetobacter baumannii DSM 30007T which was isolated from human urine. WGS of the novel species K. piersonii, whose type strain IIIF1SW-P2T was also isolated from location no. 1 of the ISS [7], was compared with the MAGs (F3-1P, F3-5P, F3-7P, and F3-8P). This comparison exhibited the same genetic composition, which confirms that the MAGs might have originated from the living cells. In addition, the comparative genomic analysis of the uropathogenic strain of K. piersonii strain YU22, isolated from human urine [48], revealed no SNVs.DNA gyrase subunit A To observe positional sequence variation in the DNA gyrase subunit A, S. aureus MAG F2-8P was compared with the genomes of the type strain ATCC 12600T, isolated from pleural fluid, and most SNPs were found.

A. pittii was extremely dissimilar to its type strain. Many SNPs found in these 333 alignments have been found in the Earth homologs. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the most SNPs found within the ISS strain. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. More epigenetic and chemical analyses are needed to understand why members of these species are particularly sensitive to these conditions. The difference may also lie in the low percent identity the Earth homologs had. In regards to the Staphylococcus strains, ATCC12600 and GD1108 are both nosocomial strains which seem to act differently in each gene. For example, in some genes, ATCC12600 exhibits SNPs, while GD1108 is the only Earth homolog that has the exact same sequence as the ISS strain. Strain GD1108 was isolated from a school child from a prevalence survey in 2011 in Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China [50]. Common SNPs were not found between the ISS and homolog strains within alignments. SNPs in Earth homologs symbolize differences in where the strain was found from. For example, Earth homologs that are found in soil exhibit very different sequences with the ISS strain, therefore explaining the SNPs. In addition, most SNPs have been found in human fluids as well as soil/plants with a few animal excretions. This demonstrates that the ISS strain has some nosocomial/soil background in relation to the rest of the alignment. Strains that are similar/dissimilar to the ISS strain show no common isolation source for the most part. Therefore, more biochemical analyses on the molecular level are needed. In MAG gene analysis (Supplemental Table S1), it was observed that similar genes were responsible for antibiotic resistance and virulence. This common gene-based resistant phenomenon suggests that changes are an adaptation strategy in microbes.Genes related to biofilm characteristics Biofilm forming and quorum-sensing (QS) genes analyzed in this study and their predicted functions are tabulated in Supplemental Table S2. Sequences of all four E. bungandensis ISS strains and the MAG (F1-2P) exhibited 100% sequence similarities among them for the genes responsible for biofilm (pgaABCD) and QS (LsrABCD, LsrR, LsrK, and AI-LuxS) functions. The variable residues (SNPs) of genes related to biofilm formation and QS-related genes in E. bungandensis MAG when compared to E. bugandensis strains (n = 11) isolated from clinical samples are given in Table 5. The comparative sequence analysis of E. bugandensis MAG shows that the biofilm and QS genes are highly conserved (< 1% SNPs variation) across most of the clinical strains of E. bugandensis (n = 10). This pattern is also consistent with the neighbor-joining tree of each one of these genes for all the strains tested and one MAG (data not shown). These analyses confirmed that E. bugandensis strains might have hitch-hiked with the healthy crew and landed on ISS surfaces. In contrast, the sequence variation of all biofilm and QS genes of E. bugandensis strain MBRL 1077 was highly variable (2.4 to 25%). The average nucleic acid index (ANI) of MBRL 1077 and the E. bugandensis type strain EB-247 were ~95%, whereas the ANI was > 99% for the other 10 clinical strains, four ISS isolates, and one MAG. The higher SNPs and lower ANI values of MBRL 1077 strain with all other 14 strains and one MAG suggested that MBRL 1077 might not belong to E. bugandensis. Table 5.

This result is interesting because this gene codes for the autoinducer proteins which are very important for carrying signals [51]. In that regard, environmental stress would have no effect on that gene since a change in the gene sequence would not serve to increase the rate of biofilm production and increase the overall amount of biofilm formed, but we can also see that there is a decent amount of amino acid change in the LsrC gene which is responsible for importing the autoinducer, and this makes sense because while the autoinducer itself does not need to be changed, the rate at which it is imported to carry information needs to be increased or reduced to accommodate for the change in the amount of biofilm produced. On the other hand, changes in the nucleotide sequence of the pgaA and pgaB genes, along with the LsrK gene, lead to high amino acid change. This could serve as a strong indication of these organisms trying to adjust to the environmental stress because the pgaA and pgaB are responsible for transporting the PGA essential in the movement of adhesin out of the periplasm to form the biofilm. Also, the LsrK is responsible for repressing the LsrR repressor, and increasing the function of all three genes will aid in increased signal for biofilm to be formed faster, as well as increase the rate of biofilm formation.Conclusion In summary, good quality bacterial and fungal MAGs were generated from ISS environmental samples, and functional properties were predicted. Furthermore, it was possible to describe novel microbial (two bacterial and one yeast) species via the “metagenome to phenome” approach. The monophyletic phylogeny exhibited by the ISS genomes (both isolates and MAGs) suggested that they shared a single common ancestor. The molecules pertaining to the cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were in high frequency in ISS genomes demonstrating evidence for ISS-specific bacterial evolution. The common gene-based resistance phenomenon noticed in this study suggests that SNP changes in MAGs and ISS genomes might be an adaptation strategy in AMR and biofilm formation in microbes. Similarly, variations found in the AMR and virulence genes enabled the prediction of the ecology and evolution of microorganisms in space. The maximum SNPs characterized for the ISS Pantoea/Kalamiella strains suggested that enterobacterial species are much more subjective to microgravity changes. However, fixation of environmental samples in space for RNAseq approach and/or in situ sequencing in space are warranted to confirm variation related to microbial evolution under microgravity. More studies are needed to unearth whether SNPs seen in ISS MAGs are due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. Supplementary Information Additional file 1.

    "title": "Comparative genomic analysis of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. isolated from the International Space Station",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10308117/",
    "abstract": "Abstract A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella, designated as F6_2S_P_1T. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade.

    "introduction": "Introduction The International Space Station (ISS) is an orbital space habitat which has been continuously inhabited by astronauts for 22 years (Robinson et al., 2006) and is therefore the only current model for how the microbiome of a space habitat evolves over time. Because the ISS is hermetically sealed against the vacuum of space, sources of its microbiome must necessarily be the human commensals from the astronauts, new equipment and supplies, or experiments conducted on board (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022). With a number of both governmental and commercial closed-habitat space facilities planned for both earth and lunar orbit in the near future, studying the microbiome of this unique habitat is vital to understanding both how astronaut health is affected by the presence of bacteria and fungi exposed to the space environment, and how those microbes can be utilized for biotechnological applications. Part of this effort should include the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and taxonomic classification of microbes isolated from the ISS, to track their sources, spread, interactions, and potential applications. Until the mid-2010s, monitoring of bacteria and fungi aboard the ISS was mainly done via traditional culturing and identification using Sanger sequencing methods, to ensure crew health and food and water safety (La Duc et al., 2004; Checinska et al., 2015). More recently, a series of NASA Space Biology-funded missions known as Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 investigated the metagenomes of ISS surfaces and performed WGS on all isolated bacteria and fungi (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2016; Venkateswaran et al., 2017; Urbaniak et al., 2018; Bijlani et al., 2020; Daudu et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020; Blachowicz et al., 2021; Simpson et al., 2021a,b), in order to fully characterize the ISS microbiome and how it changes over time (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022). In the ongoing Microbial Tracking investigation of the ISS, spore-forming bacteria have been isolated multiple times from the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus; however, this is the first instance that a bacterium from the genus Cohnella has been isolated from an ISS surface. As part of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series, during April of 2018, astronauts sampled various surfaces aboard the ISS (Urbaniak et al., 2022) with pre-packaged, pre-sterilized wipes, including the panel behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Upon return to Earth, the strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated from the WHC sample wipe, on blood agar incubated at 37°C. Preliminary 16S rRNA sequence analysis placed strain F6_2S_P_1T in the genus Cohnella. The genus Cohnella (family Paenibacillaceae, order Bacillales, phylum Firmicutes/Bacillota) was first proposed by Kampfer et al. (2006) as distinct from the genus Paenibacillus, with the description of Cohnella thermotolerans (type species, isolated during hygiene checks at a starch production company in Sweden) and the reclassification of Paenibacillus hongkongensis as Cohnella hongkongensis (Teng et al., 2003). Cohnella species are differentiated from Paenibacillus due to high iso-C16:0 content in their fatty acid profiles (Kampfer et al., 2006). Members of Cohnella are rod-shaped, usually endospore-forming, and gram-positive. Cohnella species have been first isolated from a wide variety of environmental samples, most usually in soil (Kampfer et al., 2014), but also in plant tissue (Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008; Flores-Felix et al., 2014) and compost heaps (He et al., 2013). Species from this genus are used in industrial applications including fermentation, biofuel production, and wastewater treatment bioreactors (Lin et al., 2020; Hero et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Mohammadi et al., 2022). As with the genus Paenibacillus, many members of the genus Cohnella are strongly associated with the plant rhizosphere environment, particularly that of legume species (Niang et al., 2018). Multiple novel Cohnella species have been discovered in the root nodules of leguminous plants, although only two species are known to fix nitrogen (Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012, 2015; Flores-Felix et al., 2014; Takada et al., 2019). Cohnella species are also thought to play an important role in recycling plant biomass within soil, with multiple members of the genus possessing genes for degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose, and xylan (Khianngam et al., 2010; Hameed et al., 2013; Hero et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 2021). Overall, while Cohnella species have been occasionally detected in the blood and oral cavities of immune-compromised or otherwise unhealthy individuals (Teng et al., 2003; Abou Abdallah et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2021), they do not appear to be common human commensals. In this study, we completed the characterization study of strain F6_2S_P_1T and describe it here with three main objectives. The first objective was to establish Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T as a novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes), and comparative genomic analyses were carried out. In addition, initial taxonomic analysis for strain F6_2S_P_1T showed that it was most closely related to four Cohnella species without publicly available genomes, two of which are officially recognized species (Kim et al., 2010; Kampfer et al., 2014). Thus, the strains Cohnella ginsengisoli DSM 18997T and Cohnella rhizosphaerae DSM 28161T were acquired from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) and whole-genome-sequenced, and assembled draft genomes were generated for these species. The second objective was to discover the phylogenetic placement of strain F6_2S_P_1T within the genus Cohnella, for which we performed multiple phylogenetic analyses as well as a pangenome, and a genome-based tree containing all shared single-copy core genes from the genus Cohnella. The third objective was to explore the functional traits predicted by the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Because strain F6_2S_P_1T is part of a branch of the genus Cohnella which is only distantly related to the rest of the genus, the functional traits predicted for the entire closely related clade of which strain F6_2S_P_1T is a member were characterized.",

In addition, WGSs of C. ginsengisoli and C. rhizosphaerae were generated and compared with the genome of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T to identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits. Genome characteristics and relatedness indices Assembly statistics for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1, C. ginsengisoli, and C. rhizosphaerae are summarized in Table 1. Genome sizes are 9.06 Mb for strain F6_2S_P_1, 7.22 Mb for C. ginsengisoli, and 8.5 Mb for C. rhizosphaerae. GC content ranged from 58.37% for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T to 59.49% for C. rhizosphaerae. In general, among 39 sequenced Cohnella genomes, genome size varied from 4.0 to 9.4 Mb. This genome variation should be investigated for any functional genes acquired or shed over time. Table 1.

The 16S rDNA sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1T with the members of this clade ranged from 98.84 to 97.37%. “C. plantaginis” and “C. capsici” form their own well-supported branch within this clade, while C. rhizosphaerae is basal to strain F6_2S_P_1T and C. ginsengisoli is the most basal species of the clade (Figure 1). However, branch support for the divergence of strain F6_2S_P_1T from C. rhizosphaerae was low (50) and not shown in Figure 1. A gyrB-based phylogeny was also generated using all publicly available Cohnella genomes plus the outgroups T. dichotomicus and T. vulgaris (Figure 2). The gyrB sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1T with the members of this clade ranged from 93.99 to 93.55%. The gyrB tree supports the position of strain F6_2S_P_1T as non-basal to C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, with C. ginsengisoli as the most basal species in this branch of the genus Cohnella. Since WGSs of “C. plantaginis” and “C. capsici” are not available, they were not included in the gyrB phylogeny. Figure 1.

Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on gyrB sequences of the genus Cohnella.The genome-based tree (Figure 3) for all sequenced and fully described Cohnella species was based on a concatenated alignment of 14 gene clusters containing a total of 294 single-copy core genes common to all species in the genus. This tree supports the position of C. rhizosphaerae as basal to C. ginsengisoli, in contrast to the 16S and gyrB trees. Nevertheless, the position of strain F6_2S_P_1T remains the same. A second genome-based tree was generated using a second pangenome analysis including genomes of all Cohnella species along with yet-to-be described species (Supplementary Figure S1), which showed that Cohnella sp. OV330 and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 are also part of this clade, with Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 as the most basal species and Cohnella sp. OV330 as basal to C. ginsengisoli and strain F6_2S_P_1T. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree based on 294 single-copy core genes shared by all available Cohnella species genomes. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization Light microscopy and staining with safranin and malachite green show that cells are rod-shaped and vary extensively in length and that strain F6_2S_P_1T forms ellipsoidal/oval endospores which quickly convert back to vegetative cells (Figure 4). SEM imaging reveals the presence of peritrichous flagella attached to F6_2S_P_1T cells (Figure 5A) and confirms the presence of elongated cells (Figure 5B). Figure 4.

F6_2S_P_1T with other Cohnella species are depicted in Table 3. Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T grew at temperatures between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies were weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. Catalase positive in C. ginsengisoli, C. plantaginis, and C. capsici; absence of growth at 3% NaCl and production of oxidase in C. ginsengisoli; absence of endospore formation in C. rhizosphaerae; nitrate reduction not seen in C. plantaginis and C. capsica were some of the phenotypic characteristics that could differentiate Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T from other Cohnella species. Table 3. Phenotypic characteristics of strain F6_2S_P_1T and closely related species of genus Cohnella.

Descriptions of C. capsici and C. plantaginis do not report low abundance menaquinones, but the quinone system of F6_2S_P_1T is similar to that of C. rhizosphaerae (99.8% MK-7, 0.2% MK-8), while C. ginsengisoli has 93% MK-7 and 7% MK-6. Comparative genomic analysis of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade The genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T contained 309 genes not aligned with other species of Cohnella, named or undescribed (Figure 6). Of these genes, 121 of them received an annotation from at least one predictive database. Annotated genes specific to strain F6_2S_P_1T were dominated by the COG pathways of carbohydrate and/or amino acid transport and metabolism (27 genes), transcription (10 genes), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (11 genes), and signal transduction mechanisms (+ transcription) (18 genes). The large number of carbon-cycling metabolic genes found in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T within Cohnella is unsurprising, given the diverse nature of the carbon substrates which strain F6_2S_P_1T, C. capsici, and C. plantaginis can metabolize compared to the fairly limited substrates utilized by C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli (Table 3). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Pangenomic analysis of the genus Cohnella, including C. hashimotonis sp. nov. (pink) as well as its previously unsequenced closest relatives C. rhizosphaerae (blue) and C. ginsengisoli (green).Because C. capsici and C. plantaginis are both characterized as fixing N2, the annotations for the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T were searched extensively for genes having to do with nitrogen fixation, as well as blastn and blastx searches for key genes involved in N2 fixation. However, despite the presence of the gene nifU in most species of the genus Cohnella, there was no indication that strain F6_2S_P_1T encodes for N2 fixation. Other genes of interest predicted by annotation on the RAST platform include multiple genes for endospore formation and for the plant growth hormone auxin, genes which are likely shared by many members of the genus Cohnella, which belongs to the order Bacillales (including many known spore formers) and which are common plant endophytes. BGCs which might produce secondary metabolites were predicted in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T via the antiSMASH pipeline, including two lassopeptides, two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase clusters, one agrD-like cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide, one protein cluster, and one heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase. All are uncharacterized except the two lassopeptides; these are moderate matches to the lasso peptide paeninodin which was characterized from the species Paenibacillus dendritiformis (Zhu et al., 2016). Paeninodin and BGCs showing similarity to it have been predicted in multiple Bacillus and Paenibacillus endophyte species and are suspected to have biocontrol properties that combat plant pathogens (Muñoz et al., 2022; Semenzato et al., 2022). The genomes of C. ginsengisoli, C. rhizosphaerae, and strain F6_2S_P_1T all contained 2–3 predicted BGCs for paeninodin, with C. ginsengisoli containing one that is a 100% match, while C. nanjingensis (the most closely related species outside the C. ginsengisoli clade) contained a single paeninodin match. The only other match in any of these species to a known BGC is a predicted cluster in the C. rhizosphaerae which is a moderate match to ectoine. Other differences include multiple cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide BGCs predicted in the genome of C. nanjingensis (vs. a single one in all other tested genomes), and a siderophore predicted in the genome of C. rhizosphaerae. Strain F6_2S_P_1T was the only genome in the genus Cohnella which a heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase was detected; these BGCs are used by cyanobacteria to compartmentalize N2 fixation and are activated in low-nitrogen conditions (Campbell et al., 1997), but as strain F6_2S_P_1T does not contain a full suite of genes for N2 fixation and the cluster is not a strong match, it is likely a producer of some kind of potentially uncharacterized lipid compound. No genes for antimicrobial resistance or virulence were predicted by the ABRicate pipeline. The entire closely related branch of which strain F6_2S_P_1T is a member, which we term the C. ginsengisoli clade (due to its basal position and status as the first officially described species within the clade), contained 322 gene clusters not found in any other publicly available Cohnella genome. All members of this clade in addition to strain F6_2S_P_1T were originally isolated from plant tissue or the rhizosphere environment, including C. ginsengisoli (isolated from soil in which ginseng was grown, Kim et al., 2010), C. rhizosphaerae (isolated from healthy maize seed tissue, Kampfer et al., 2014), C. capsici (isolated from Capsicum rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2015), C. plantaginis (isolated from plantain rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2012), Cohnella sp. OV330 (isolated from poplar rhizosphere, JGI, 2015), and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 (isolated from Ginko biloba root tissue, Zou et al., 2021). It is speculated that strain F6_2S_P_1T might have originated from the plants grown in ISS. Since shotgun metagenomics of plants associated samples (tissue, water, and soil) were not available, the source of this novel strain isolated from the WHC location could not be confirmed. Cohnella was one of the top 30 genera recently detected via 16S amplicon sequencing of plant tissue of chili peppers grown in the Advanced Plant Habitat from sterilized seeds aboard the ISS, though it was not a top genus detected in artificial soil medium (Khodadad et al., 2022). Cohnella was also not a dominant member of the microbiome of Outredgeous lettuce grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2020). However, since in these ISS studies, a 250-bp 16S rRNA gene amplicon was used for the microbial diversity analyses, Cohnella species might have not been identified appropriately. Functional enrichment analysis for the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella species using the COG20 and KOfam databases revealed hundreds of statistically significantly enriched predicted functions (p < 0.05 with FDR adjustment) annotating one or more gene clusters, including 11 functions which were detected in all C. ginsengisoli clade members (Supplementary Table S1) but in none of the rest of the genus. Most notably, C. ginsengisoli clade species were enriched in genes for heme oxygenase and for a bacteriophytochrome (annotated on  as diguanylate cyclase), which were detected using both COG20 and KOfam database annotation. Consensus protein sequences for genes related to these functions, when aligned to the  database, most closely match to the genome of Paenibacillus chitinolyticus (after matches to members of the C. ginsengisoli clade); heme oxygenase and diguanylate cyclase are located one after the other in the assembled chromosome of this species (NZ_CP026520.1). Heme oxygenase (HO-1) breaks down heme and releases iron and is a regulator of intracellular iron availability in plants and animals (Singh and Bhatla, 2022). Enhanced HO-1 expression in plants and animals is also associated with stress response as the resulting biliverdin and bilirubin scavenge ROS species (Singh and Bhatla, 2022); the bacterial species Paenibacillus polymyxa applied as a probiotic induces increased intestinal HO-1 expression as part of its anti-oxidant effects on gut health in animals (Wu et al., 2019). In bacteria, expression and production of heme oxygenase are associated with iron scavenging within a host, and heme oxygenase expression can have either beneficial anti-oxidant or enhanced pathogenic effects on plant or animal hosts (Richard et al., 2019). In non-photosynthetic bacteria, heme oxygenase also produces biliverdin which is used as the chromatophore in bacteriophytochromes (Takemoto et al., 2019). It is also possible that this HO-1/diguanylate cyclase complex acts as an oxygen sensor (Martínková et al., 2013). Other functions significantly enriched in this clade include stress response genes such as heat shock protein DnaJ. KEGG pathway analysis predicted two functional pathways in all C. ginsengisoli clade species which were not present in any other Cohnella species: a pathway for carbon fixation (incomplete reductive citrate cycle) and a pathway for plant terpenoid biosynthesis (specifically beta-carotene biosynthesis). Predictive analysis of the presence of CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes, Drula et al., 2022) was followed by ordination (Figure 7; Supplementary Figure S3) and heatmap generation (Supplementary Figure S4). Both heatmaps and ordinations show that strain F6_2S_P1T and its closest relatives cluster tightly together, along with C. fermenti (isolated from a fermented vegetable, Lin et al., 2020), C. phaseoli (isolated from the root nodule of a legume species, Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008), C. zeiphila (isolated from corn tissue, Johnson et al., 2021), and several undescribed strains; members of the C. ginsengisoli clade, therefore, appear to be both taxonomically similar and have similar profiles of carbohydrate-cycling genes. PERMANOVA analysis confirmed that the centroid of the C. ginsengisoli clade was significantly different from that of other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species (p < 0.001). One axis out of three in the NMDS ordination clearly differentiates the C. ginsengisoli clade and the other Cohnella species mentioned above from the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species (NMDS2, shown in Figure 7; Supplementary Figure S3); therefore, scores correlating CAZyme ordination vectors to this axis using the envfit function were assessed for significance, plotted, and ranked against the axis in question. Figure 7. Open in a new tab First two axes of NMDS ordination (standardization = “range,” distance = “Bray-Curtis,” maxit = 500, k = 3, stress = 0.129, R2 = 0.98) for counts of different predicted CAZymes in the genomes of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species. Also present in the figure are CAZyme vector correlations with axes 1 and 2 (not original coordinates) via envfit/Pearson's correlation with fdr correction + p < 0.01. Species belonging to the C. ginsengisoli clade and the top 4 CAZyme families/subfamilies positively correlated with axis 2 are labeled.Most strongly associated with this axis and the C. ginsengisoli clade are the CAZyme families CBM67 and GH78, which were both identified as part of the enzyme α-L-rhamnosidase which alters flavonoids and other rhamnose-containing glycosides such as pectins in plant cell walls (Yadav et al., 2010). Flavonoids are phenolic compounds produced by plants that often have medicinal or flavorful properties. α-L-rhamnosidase cleaves terminal α-rhamnose residues and in doing so helps concentrate and improve the action of flavonoids; α-L-rhamnosidase from different bacterial species is used for many industrial applications such as improving wine aroma, sweetening fruit juice, and increasing concentration and efficacy of antibiotic and anti-cancer compounds (Xie et al., 2022). The C. ginsengisoli clade and other Cohnella species enriched in α-L-rhamnosidase enzyme modules are all confirmed or likely plant symbionts or feed on plant tissue; however, since the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species appear to have at least some association with plant tissue or rhizosphere, there may be additional promising applications for these particular species in processing plant medicinal or other plant phenolic compounds. CAZymes negatively associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade (and associated mainly with Paenibacillus species) include chitosanases (GH46 and CBM12), endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GH85), and β-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GT17). Four CAZyme families associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species had an effect size of 0.5 or greater (Kruskal–Wallis); these were maltooligosaccharide-producing α-amylases (CG13_5), chondroitin AC lyase (PL8_3), and alginate lyases (PL34 and PL14_3). Presence of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T in ISS metagenomes Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces, crew capsule, and ISS HEPA filter particulates (Venkateswaran et al., 2014; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022) were mapped to the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Most metagenomes had <0.05% of reads that mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1T, with a maximum of 0.22% of reads mapping to strain F6_2S_P_1T for a low-read-number sample collected from the cupola of the ISS during Flight 4 of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series. But upon examination of regions to which the metagenomic reads mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1T, 98+% of reads mapped to regions of 16S or 23S rRNA genes and were only considered significant by bowtie2 because of the conserved nature of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes. We therefore concluded that strain F6_2S_P_1T is not dominant in the ISS environmental surfaces or air particulates collected during the Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 mission series. However, molecular microbial diversity-based examination of plant and its associated materials using culturing and metagenomics would allow NASA to trace the source of this strain, since Cohnella species were reported to produce hormones that might promote growth of plants. For example, as mentioned above, Cohnella was an abundant genus in the microbiome of healthy plant tissue of chili plants grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2022).",

    "conclusion": "Conclusion We used multiple means of characterization, including phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional genome-prediction methods to characterize Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and place it within the established taxonomy of the genus Cohnella. Based on these data, we propose that this novel species be named C. hashimotonis. We also characterized the branch of Cohnella within which C. hashimotonis is placed and predicted functional characteristics of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade as a whole. All species of Cohnella closely related to C. hashimotonis are from the plant/rhizosphere environment and likely have mutualistic associations with plant roots or other tissue. It is likely, therefore, that C. hashimotonis was introduced to the ISS not as a human commensal but as a plant commensal during one of the many plant growth experiments conducted on board. Nevertheless, C. hashimotonis can clearly survive in the extreme conditions of the ISS built environment, including radiation exposure, desiccation, low nutrient availability, and microgravity, and is closely related to a number of rhizosphere bacteria; it is therefore a promising candidate for testing as a member of plant-growth-promoting consortia for future plant experiments in outer space.",

Copyright notice ID: 10308117 PMID: 37396358 Abstract A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella, designated as F6_2S_P_1T. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade. Keywords: International Space Station (ISS), novel bacteria, Cohnella, space biology, pangenome analysisIntroduction The International Space Station (ISS) is an orbital space habitat which has been continuously inhabited by astronauts for 22 years (Robinson et al., 2006) and is therefore the only current model for how the microbiome of a space habitat evolves over time. Because the ISS is hermetically sealed against the vacuum of space, sources of its microbiome must necessarily be the human commensals from the astronauts, new equipment and supplies, or experiments conducted on board (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022). With a number of both governmental and commercial closed-habitat space facilities planned for both earth and lunar orbit in the near future, studying the microbiome of this unique habitat is vital to understanding both how astronaut health is affected by the presence of bacteria and fungi exposed to the space environment, and how those microbes can be utilized for biotechnological applications. Part of this effort should include the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and taxonomic classification of microbes isolated from the ISS, to track their sources, spread, interactions, and potential applications. Until the mid-2010s, monitoring of bacteria and fungi aboard the ISS was mainly done via traditional culturing and identification using Sanger sequencing methods, to ensure crew health and food and water safety (La Duc et al., 2004; Checinska et al., 2015). More recently, a series of NASA Space Biology-funded missions known as Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 investigated the metagenomes of ISS surfaces and performed WGS on all isolated bacteria and fungi (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2016; Venkateswaran et al., 2017; Urbaniak et al., 2018; Bijlani et al., 2020; Daudu et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020; Blachowicz et al., 2021; Simpson et al., 2021a,b), in order to fully characterize the ISS microbiome and how it changes over time (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022). In the ongoing Microbial Tracking investigation of the ISS, spore-forming bacteria have been isolated multiple times from the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus; however, this is the first instance that a bacterium from the genus Cohnella has been isolated from an ISS surface. As part of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series, during April of 2018, astronauts sampled various surfaces aboard the ISS (Urbaniak et al., 2022) with pre-packaged, pre-sterilized wipes, including the panel behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Upon return to Earth, the strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated from the WHC sample wipe, on blood agar incubated at 37°C. Preliminary 16S rRNA sequence analysis placed strain F6_2S_P_1T in the genus Cohnella. The genus Cohnella (family Paenibacillaceae, order Bacillales, phylum Firmicutes/Bacillota) was first proposed by Kampfer et al. (2006) as distinct from the genus Paenibacillus, with the description of Cohnella thermotolerans (type species, isolated during hygiene checks at a starch production company in Sweden) and the reclassification of Paenibacillus hongkongensis as Cohnella hongkongensis (Teng et al., 2003). Cohnella species are differentiated from Paenibacillus due to high iso-C16:0 content in their fatty acid profiles (Kampfer et al., 2006). Members of Cohnella are rod-shaped, usually endospore-forming, and gram-positive. Cohnella species have been first isolated from a wide variety of environmental samples, most usually in soil (Kampfer et al., 2014), but also in plant tissue (Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008; Flores-Felix et al., 2014) and compost heaps (He et al., 2013). Species from this genus are used in industrial applications including fermentation, biofuel production, and wastewater treatment bioreactors (Lin et al., 2020; Hero et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Mohammadi et al., 2022). As with the genus Paenibacillus, many members of the genus Cohnella are strongly associated with the plant rhizosphere environment, particularly that of legume species (Niang et al., 2018). Multiple novel Cohnella species have been discovered in the root nodules of leguminous plants, although only two species are known to fix nitrogen (Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012, 2015; Flores-Felix et al., 2014; Takada et al., 2019). Cohnella species are also thought to play an important role in recycling plant biomass within soil, with multiple members of the genus possessing genes for degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose, and xylan (Khianngam et al., 2010; Hameed et al., 2013; Hero et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 2021). Overall, while Cohnella species have been occasionally detected in the blood and oral cavities of immune-compromised or otherwise unhealthy individuals (Teng et al., 2003; Abou Abdallah et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2021), they do not appear to be common human commensals. In this study, we completed the characterization study of strain F6_2S_P_1T and describe it here with three main objectives. The first objective was to establish Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T as a novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes), and comparative genomic analyses were carried out. In addition, initial taxonomic analysis for strain F6_2S_P_1T showed that it was most closely related to four Cohnella species without publicly available genomes, two of which are officially recognized species (Kim et al., 2010; Kampfer et al., 2014). Thus, the strains Cohnella ginsengisoli DSM 18997T and Cohnella rhizosphaerae DSM 28161T were acquired from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) and whole-genome-sequenced, and assembled draft genomes were generated for these species. The second objective was to discover the phylogenetic placement of strain F6_2S_P_1T within the genus Cohnella, for which we performed multiple phylogenetic analyses as well as a pangenome, and a genome-based tree containing all shared single-copy core genes from the genus Cohnella. The third objective was to explore the functional traits predicted by the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Because strain F6_2S_P_1T is part of a branch of the genus Cohnella which is only distantly related to the rest of the genus, the functional traits predicted for the entire closely related clade of which strain F6_2S_P_1T is a member were characterized.Materials and methods Sample collection and isolation Methods for preparing sampling kits and processing samples were similar to those used in the Microbial Tracking 1 mission (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). For each of five flight missions for Microbial Tracking 2, Sterile TexTra™ 10 TX3224 Dry Cleanroom Wipers were moistened with 15 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), folded into quarters and placed in sterile Ziploc baggies, which were later used to assemble sampling kits at NASA Ames. Sampling kits were transported to the ISS, where astronauts collected surface particulates from a square meter area of eight surfaces: (1) the cupola, (2) the WHC, (3) the advanced resistive exercise device, (4) dining table, (5) Zero-Gravity Stowage Rack overhead 4, (6) permanent multipurpose module Port 1, (7) laboratory overhead 3, and (8) crew quarters bump-out exterior wall (see Singh et al., 2018 for detailed surface descriptions). For each surface, the astronaut tasked with sampling donned a new pair of sterile gloves, removed and unfolded a sterile wipe from its bag, and wiped a square meter area of the surface three times, folding the wipe in half for the second pass and into quarters for the third pass; each time, the surface was sampled in a different direction (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) using the new previously unexposed surface of the wipe. Additionally, a wipe was removed from its bag and briefly exposed to the air, as an environmental control. A total of nine (eight locations and one control) samples were produced for each flight and stored at 4°C aboard the ISS and during transport to earth. Upon delivery to Jet Propulsion Laboratory, ISS wipes and unopened control wipes were processed for the isolation of environmental microbes within a 12-h period. Each wipe was placed in a sterile 500-ml bottle with 200-ml sterile PBS and shaken vigorously for 2 min. PBS was then concentrated using an Innovaprep CP-150 (Innovaprep LLC, Drexel, Missouri, United States) with a 0.2 μm polysulfone hollow fiber concentrating pipette tip (Innovaprep LLC, SKU CC08022-10). Using additional sterile PBS, dilutions of 10−1 through 10−6 were prepared and plated onto Reasoner's 2 agar (R2A, BD Diagnostics Cat # 218263), potato dextrose agar (BD Diagnostics Cat #213400) with 0.05 g/L chloramphenicol, and blood agar (Hardy Diagnostics, #A10) media. Five colonies from each sample on each media type were selected and stored in one-tenth strength tryptic soy agar (TSA) stabs. Strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated from blood agar inoculated with the PBS concentrate from Location 2 (wall behind WHC), collected during Flight 6 (third flight in the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series).DNA extraction and whole-genome sequencing The ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit was used to extract genomic DNA from strain F6_2S_P_1T according to the manufacturer's instructions. An Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit was used to prepare the library for WGS as in Simpson et al. (2021b). The library was sequenced as part of a run on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform. FastQC v0.11.7 (Bioinformatics, 2011) was used to quality filter and trim reads, and fastp v0.20 (Chen et al., 2018) was used to remove adapter sequences. A draft genome was assembled to the scaffold level using SPAdes v3.11.1 (Bankevich et al., 2012). Assembly quality, including number of contigs, genome size, and N50 value, was assessed using QUAST v5.0.2 (Gurevich et al., 2013). Default settings were used for all steps except for fastp, which included 512 adapters screening. A secondary round of sequencing for strain F6_2S_P_1T, as well as C. ginsengisoli DSM 18997T and C. rhizosphaerae DSM 28161T, was conducted using Oxford Nanopore sequencing. C. ginsengisoli DSM 18997T and C. rhizosphaerae DSM 28161T were ordered from the DSMZ and cryostocks prepared for long term storage. To produce a more resolved genome for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and to provide WGS, all strains were re-streaked from cryostock on TSA and genomic DNA was extracted using a Zymo QuikSpin DNA extraction kit. Nanopore sequencing libraries were prepared using an SQK-LSK110 Ligation Sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore) and sequenced on an R9.4.1 flow cell, with base calling via MinKNOW/Guppy. Porechop (Wick et al., 2017a) and Nanofilt (De Coster et al., 2018) were used to remove adapter sequences and filter reads using the settings “-q 10 -l 200.” A hybrid genome assembly for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T was generated via Unicycler (Wick et al., 2017b) using Nanopore reads to polish the Illumina assembly. Flye (Kolmogorov et al., 2019) followed by polishing with Medaka (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was used to assemble draft genomes for type strains of C. ginsengisoli and C. rhizosphaerae from Nanopore reads, and assembly quality was assessed using QUAST v5.0.2 (Gurevich et al., 2013).Phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences was carried out by extracting the 16S rDNA sequence from the WGS of strain F6_2S_P_1T and aligning it to the  nucleotide database via blast search. The top 30 matching 16S rRNA sequences were retrieved. In addition, all publicly available genomes from the genus Cohnella were downloaded, and their 16S rDNA sequences were extracted using a blast wrapper script. 16S rRNA genes from the species Paenibacillus barengoltzii, Paenibacillus terrae, Thermoflavimicrobial dichotomicus, and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris were used to root the tree. Similarly, gyrB sequences from strain F6_2S_P_1T and from all publicly available Cohnella genomes, and the outgroups T. dichotomicus and T. vulgaris were extracted with the same wrapper script. For both gyrB and 16S trees, alignment was performed in R using the DECIPHER package (Wright, 2016). Trimming and tree-building using maximum likelihood and the substitution model GTR + G + I were performed using the phangorn package, including model selection using AIC values and 1,000 bootstrap replicates (Schliep, 2011). Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA and gyrB genes were visualized using ggtree (Yu et al., 2017). A genome-based phylogenetic tree was also generated using genes detected from the pangenomic analysis, which contained all publicly available Cohnella genomes, plus those of strain F6_2S_P_1T, C. ginsengisoli, and C. rhizosphaerae generated during this study (see below section for methods for pangenomic tree generation). Aligned, single-copy core genes which were shared by all species and had a geometric homogeneity of 1, but a functional homogeneity below 0.9, were extracted from the Cohnella genus pangenome into a concatenated FASTA file. A maximum likelihood genome-based tree was generated using raxml v8.2.12 (Stamatakis, 2014; Kozlov et al., 2019) with a GTR-GAMMA substitution model and the option “autoMRE” to automatically choose the optimal number of bootstrap replicates. The tree was visualized using the online platform Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) (Letunic and Bork, 2007). Additionally, average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) were calculated for strain F6_2S_P_1T against all sequenced and described Cohnella species using fastANI v1.33 (Jain et al., 2018) and DSMZ's online Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator v3.0 (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2022).Light microscopy and SEM A liquid culture of strain F6_2S_P_1T was incubated at 80°C for 10 min, then plated on R2A and grown at 30°C for 5 days to induce endospore formation. Endospore staining with malachite green and safranin was performed using the Schaeffer–Fulton method (Schaeffer and Fulton, 1933). Light microscopy and phase contrast images were taken on an Olympus BX53 microscope with an Olympus DP25 camera using Olympus cellSens software. To prepare a colony of strain F6_2S_P_1T for SEM, the strain was streaked out on TSA and allowed to grow at 30°C for 48 h. A pure colony was then suspended in chilled 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, United States) in 0.1M sodium cacodylate (NaCaco) (Sigma Aldrich) solution for 1 h. The sample was then filtered through a 0.2 μm Isopore filter membrane (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, United States) and moved into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. The sample was then incubated in 0.1 M NaCaco solution at 4°C for 10 min and then replaced with fresh 0.1 M NaCaco solution; this replacement was repeated three times. The sample was then dehydrated in a series of increasing IPA solutions mixed with water for 10 min each. The series was 50, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%, with the final 100% IPA rinsing occurring three times. The specimen was stored at 4°C in 100% IPA until it was critical point dried in a Tousimis Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Rockville, MD, United States). Samples were adhered with carbon tape to SEM stubs (Ted Pella Inc.) and then underwent ~12 nm thick carbon coating with a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Deerfield, IL, United States). SEM micrographs were captured on a FEI Quanta 200F microscope (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, United States) located at the California Institute of Technologies Kavli Nanoscience Institute.Pangenomic analysis and other genome characterization Pangenomic analysis was carried out using anvi'o v7.1 (Eren et al., 2015) similar to methods described in Singh et al. (2021). Open reading frames were annotated with COG, KEGG, and KOfam database pathways/functions, and ANI between all genomes was additionally calculated. Two pangenomes were generated: one including all publicly available Cohnella genomes including unnamed species and one containing only named species. The function anvi-compute-functional-enrichment-in-pan was used to calculate functional enrichment in the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to the rest of the genus Cohnella. The genome of the strain F6_2S_P_1T was also uploaded and annotated using the online Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology (RAST platform) (Aziz et al., 2008). The presence of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) which might produce secondary metabolites was predicted in the strain F6_2S_P_1T genome using the antiSMASH pipeline (Blin et al., 2021). The presence of antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes was predicted by the ABRicate pipeline (Seemann, 2018). To evaluate the diversity of carbohydrate-degrading and other carbohydrate-cycling enzymes (Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes, i.e., CAZymes) (Drula et al., 2022), the dbcan3 stand-alone tool (Zhang et al., 2018) was run against all publicly available genomes in the genera Cohnella and Paenibacillus as well as the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T, C. ginsengisoli, and C. rhizosphaerae. The results were parsed to generate a count matrix for the number of each CAZyme family/subfamily predicted in the genome of each species. All statistics and plots from analysis of this data were generated in R [v 4.2.2, “Innocent and Trusting,” R Core Team (2022)] utilizing the Tidyverse package (Wickham et al., 2019). An NMDS ordination (stress = 12.9, k = 3) was generated via vegan (Oksanen et al., 2019) using Bray–Curtis distance after standardization of each CAZyme category to between 0 and 1, and individual Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed for each CAZyme testing mean abundance between members of the C. ginsengisoli clade and other species of Cohnella and Paenibacillus with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Additionally, a heatmap of abundance for each category was generated using the pheatmap package (Kolde and Kolde, 2018) after standardization of the data using robust centered log ratios.Phenotypic characterization Growth temperature was determined by inoculating both solid (R2A plates) and liquid (trypticase soy broth (TSB), BD Diagnostics Cat # 257107) media in 15 ml loose-capped centrifuge tubes with strain F6_2S_P_1T and growing at 4, 15, 25, 30, 37, and 45°C. Plates and tubes were checked for growth daily for 7 days and incubation was halted if growth was observed. Samples grown at 4 and 15°C were incubated for additional time before final growth assessment: 2 weeks total for growth at 15°C and 4 weeks total at 4°C. Salt tolerance was determined by inoculating strain F6_2S_P_1T onto R2A with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% added NaCl, as well as agar containing only peptone plus 0 or 1% NaCl, and examining growth after 7 days of incubation at 30°C. Oxidase activity was determined by testing solid culture with OxiDrops™ liquid oxidase reagent (Hardy Diagnostics). Catalase activity was determined by mixing colonies of strain F6_2S_P_1T with hydrogen peroxide on a sterile glass slide and monitoring for the presence of effervescence. pH tolerance (4–10) was tested by adjusting the pH of TSB broth with biological buffers as in Xu et al. (2005).Mapping of metagenomic reads to genome Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces from Microbial Tracking 1 (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019) and Microbial Tracking 2 (Urbaniak et al., 2022) were mapped to the genome of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), using the flags “—no-mixed” (no unpaired alignments) and “—no-discordant” (only matches where both forward and reverse reads map to the same area are considered). The number of matches where both a forward and reverse read mapped to the Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T genome were reported as a percentage of total reads.Chemotaxonomic analysis Cells grown in TSB medium were harvested when growth of the cultures reached approximately 70% of the maximal optical density (exponential growth phase) and used for analysis of cellular fatty acids, polar lipids, and quinones, which was done as described previously (Ramaprasad et al., 2015). In brief, for cellular fatty acids analysis, 40 mg of bacterial cells were subjected to a series of four different reagents followed by saponification and methylation of fatty acids, thus enabling their cleavage from lipids. The fatty acid methyl esters thus obtained were analyzed by gas chromatography. The peaks obtained were then labeled and the equivalent chain length values were computed as published elsewhere (MIDI, 2012). The polar lipid profile was analyzed by extracting polar lipids with methanol/chloroform/saline (2:1:0.8, by vol.) from 1 g freeze-dried bacterial cells. Separation of lipids was done by two-dimensional chromatography on a silica gel TLC plate (Kieselgel 60 F254; Merck) using chloroform–methanol–water (75:32:4 by vol.) in the first dimension and chloroform–methanol–acetic acid–water (86:16:15:4 by vol.) in the second dimension. Total polar lipid profiles were detected by spraying with 6% ethanolic molybdophosphoric acid. The respiratory isoprenoid quinone was extracted with chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1, v/v), evaporated under a vacuum, re-extracted with acetone, and analyzed using high-performance lipid chromatography according to previously reported methods (Ramaprasad et al., 2018). Polyamines were analyzed as described by Busse and Auling (1988) and Busse et al. (1997). The peptidoglycan of cells of strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated following disruption of the cells by shaking with glass beads and subsequent trypsin digestion, according to the method of Schleifer (1985). Cell wall was hydrolyzed for amino acid analyses as described by Schleifer and Kandler (1972). Amino acids in cell-wall hydrolysates were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Mckerrow et al., 2000; Ramaprasad et al., 2015). Carbon substrate utilization profile analysis was carried out as per the BioLog protocol provided by the manufacturer for Firmicutes using the GEN III MicroPlate test assay with a Biolog system (Hayward, CA, USA).Results and discussion Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T isolated from the ISS was subjected to polyphasic taxonomic characterization to determine its phylogenetic affiliation. In addition, WGSs of C. ginsengisoli and C. rhizosphaerae were generated and compared with the genome of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T to identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits. Genome characteristics and relatedness indices Assembly statistics for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1, C. ginsengisoli, and C. rhizosphaerae are summarized in Table 1. Genome sizes are 9.06 Mb for strain F6_2S_P_1, 7.22 Mb for C. ginsengisoli, and 8.5 Mb for C. rhizosphaerae. GC content ranged from 58.37% for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T to 59.49% for C. rhizosphaerae. In general, among 39 sequenced Cohnella genomes, genome size varied from 4.0 to 9.4 Mb. This genome variation should be investigated for any functional genes acquired or shed over time. Table 1.

F6_2S_P_1T and C. ginsengisoli, and C. rhizosphaerae were 88.4 and 88.0%, respectively (Table 2). ANI between Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and all other named Cohnella species for which a genome was publicly available was <79.4% (Table 2). We also tested ANI between Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and available genomes for unnamed Cohnella species and found that Cohnella sp. OV330 and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 were also closely related, with ANIs of 88.9 and 88.0%, respectively. This was also the trend for C. ginsengisoli and C. rhizosphaerae, which showed ANI to each other and to Cohnella sp. OV330 and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 ranging from 88 to 92%, and which was otherwise most closely related to C. nanjingensis with an ANI value of ~79%. The dDDH results showed a similar pattern, as values were 35 and 34.5% between Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and C. ginsengisoli, and C. rhizosphaerae, respectively, and were otherwise below 22% (Table 2).

The 16S rDNA sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1T with the members of this clade ranged from 98.84 to 97.37%. “C. plantaginis” and “C. capsici” form their own well-supported branch within this clade, while C. rhizosphaerae is basal to strain F6_2S_P_1T and C. ginsengisoli is the most basal species of the clade (Figure 1). However, branch support for the divergence of strain F6_2S_P_1T from C. rhizosphaerae was low (50) and not shown in Figure 1. A gyrB-based phylogeny was also generated using all publicly available Cohnella genomes plus the outgroups T. dichotomicus and T. vulgaris (Figure 2). The gyrB sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1T with the members of this clade ranged from 93.99 to 93.55%. The gyrB tree supports the position of strain F6_2S_P_1T as non-basal to C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, with C. ginsengisoli as the most basal species in this branch of the genus Cohnella. Since WGSs of “C. plantaginis” and “C. capsici” are not available, they were not included in the gyrB phylogeny. Figure 1.

F6_2S_P_1T in a branch of the genus including species isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere soil.Figure 2. Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on gyrB sequences of the genus Cohnella.The genome-based tree (Figure 3) for all sequenced and fully described Cohnella species was based on a concatenated alignment of 14 gene clusters containing a total of 294 single-copy core genes common to all species in the genus. This tree supports the position of C. rhizosphaerae as basal to C. ginsengisoli, in contrast to the 16S and gyrB trees. Nevertheless, the position of strain F6_2S_P_1T remains the same. A second genome-based tree was generated using a second pangenome analysis including genomes of all Cohnella species along with yet-to-be described species (Supplementary Figure S1), which showed that Cohnella sp. OV330 and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 are also part of this clade, with Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 as the most basal species and Cohnella sp. OV330 as basal to C. ginsengisoli and strain F6_2S_P_1T. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree based on 294 single-copy core genes shared by all available Cohnella species genomes.Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization Light microscopy and staining with safranin and malachite green show that cells are rod-shaped and vary extensively in length and that strain F6_2S_P_1T forms ellipsoidal/oval endospores which quickly convert back to vegetative cells (Figure 4). SEM imaging reveals the presence of peritrichous flagella attached to F6_2S_P_1T cells (Figure 5A) and confirms the presence of elongated cells (Figure 5B). Figure 4.

F6_2S_P_1T with other Cohnella species are depicted in Table 3. Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T grew at temperatures between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies were weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. Catalase positive in C. ginsengisoli, C. plantaginis, and C. capsici; absence of growth at 3% NaCl and production of oxidase in C. ginsengisoli; absence of endospore formation in C. rhizosphaerae; nitrate reduction not seen in C. plantaginis and C. capsica were some of the phenotypic characteristics that could differentiate Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T from other Cohnella species. Table 3. Phenotypic characteristics of strain F6_2S_P_1T and closely related species of genus Cohnella.

C. rhizosphaerae showed >25% of C16:0 saturated fatty acid, whereas other Cohnella species exhibited <10% production. Absence of branched fatty acid such as iso-C14:0 in Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and in C rhizosphaerae could be used to differentiate the novel species described in this study. However, production of iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C15:0 was very high in Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T when compared to other described Cohnella species. Table 4. Percentage of total cellular fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1T and closely related species of genus Cohnella.

This profile is in agreement with other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade (Kim et al., 2010; Kampfer et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). The quinone system contained menaquinones MK-7 (98%) and MK-8 (2%). The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain F6_2S_P_1T contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid, which is the case for other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade where that data are reported. All other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade also contain MK-7 as the dominant menaquinone (Kim et al., 2010; Kampfer et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). Descriptions of C. capsici and C. plantaginis do not report low abundance menaquinones, but the quinone system of F6_2S_P_1T is similar to that of C. rhizosphaerae (99.8% MK-7, 0.2% MK-8), while C. ginsengisoli has 93% MK-7 and 7% MK-6.Comparative genomic analysis of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade The genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T contained 309 genes not aligned with other species of Cohnella, named or undescribed (Figure 6). Of these genes, 121 of them received an annotation from at least one predictive database. Annotated genes specific to strain F6_2S_P_1T were dominated by the COG pathways of carbohydrate and/or amino acid transport and metabolism (27 genes), transcription (10 genes), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (11 genes), and signal transduction mechanisms (+ transcription) (18 genes). The large number of carbon-cycling metabolic genes found in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T within Cohnella is unsurprising, given the diverse nature of the carbon substrates which strain F6_2S_P_1T, C. capsici, and C. plantaginis can metabolize compared to the fairly limited substrates utilized by C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli (Table 3). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Pangenomic analysis of the genus Cohnella, including C. hashimotonis sp. nov. (pink) as well as its previously unsequenced closest relatives C. rhizosphaerae (blue) and C. ginsengisoli (green).Because C. capsici and C. plantaginis are both characterized as fixing N2, the annotations for the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T were searched extensively for genes having to do with nitrogen fixation, as well as blastn and blastx searches for key genes involved in N2 fixation. However, despite the presence of the gene nifU in most species of the genus Cohnella, there was no indication that strain F6_2S_P_1T encodes for N2 fixation. Other genes of interest predicted by annotation on the RAST platform include multiple genes for endospore formation and for the plant growth hormone auxin, genes which are likely shared by many members of the genus Cohnella, which belongs to the order Bacillales (including many known spore formers) and which are common plant endophytes. BGCs which might produce secondary metabolites were predicted in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T via the antiSMASH pipeline, including two lassopeptides, two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase clusters, one agrD-like cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide, one protein cluster, and one heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase. All are uncharacterized except the two lassopeptides; these are moderate matches to the lasso peptide paeninodin which was characterized from the species Paenibacillus dendritiformis (Zhu et al., 2016). Paeninodin and BGCs showing similarity to it have been predicted in multiple Bacillus and Paenibacillus endophyte species and are suspected to have biocontrol properties that combat plant pathogens (Muñoz et al., 2022; Semenzato et al., 2022). The genomes of C. ginsengisoli, C. rhizosphaerae, and strain F6_2S_P_1T all contained 2–3 predicted BGCs for paeninodin, with C. ginsengisoli containing one that is a 100% match, while C. nanjingensis (the most closely related species outside the C. ginsengisoli clade) contained a single paeninodin match. The only other match in any of these species to a known BGC is a predicted cluster in the C. rhizosphaerae which is a moderate match to ectoine. Other differences include multiple cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide BGCs predicted in the genome of C. nanjingensis (vs. a single one in all other tested genomes), and a siderophore predicted in the genome of C. rhizosphaerae. Strain F6_2S_P_1T was the only genome in the genus Cohnella which a heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase was detected; these BGCs are used by cyanobacteria to compartmentalize N2 fixation and are activated in low-nitrogen conditions (Campbell et al., 1997), but as strain F6_2S_P_1T does not contain a full suite of genes for N2 fixation and the cluster is not a strong match, it is likely a producer of some kind of potentially uncharacterized lipid compound. No genes for antimicrobial resistance or virulence were predicted by the ABRicate pipeline. The entire closely related branch of which strain F6_2S_P_1T is a member, which we term the C. ginsengisoli clade (due to its basal position and status as the first officially described species within the clade), contained 322 gene clusters not found in any other publicly available Cohnella genome. All members of this clade in addition to strain F6_2S_P_1T were originally isolated from plant tissue or the rhizosphere environment, including C. ginsengisoli (isolated from soil in which ginseng was grown, Kim et al., 2010), C. rhizosphaerae (isolated from healthy maize seed tissue, Kampfer et al., 2014), C. capsici (isolated from Capsicum rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2015), C. plantaginis (isolated from plantain rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2012), Cohnella sp. OV330 (isolated from poplar rhizosphere, JGI, 2015), and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 (isolated from Ginko biloba root tissue, Zou et al., 2021). It is speculated that strain F6_2S_P_1T might have originated from the plants grown in ISS. Since shotgun metagenomics of plants associated samples (tissue, water, and soil) were not available, the source of this novel strain isolated from the WHC location could not be confirmed. Cohnella was one of the top 30 genera recently detected via 16S amplicon sequencing of plant tissue of chili peppers grown in the Advanced Plant Habitat from sterilized seeds aboard the ISS, though it was not a top genus detected in artificial soil medium (Khodadad et al., 2022). Cohnella was also not a dominant member of the microbiome of Outredgeous lettuce grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2020). However, since in these ISS studies, a 250-bp 16S rRNA gene amplicon was used for the microbial diversity analyses, Cohnella species might have not been identified appropriately. Functional enrichment analysis for the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella species using the COG20 and KOfam databases revealed hundreds of statistically significantly enriched predicted functions (p < 0.05 with FDR adjustment) annotating one or more gene clusters, including 11 functions which were detected in all C. ginsengisoli clade members (Supplementary Table S1) but in none of the rest of the genus. Most notably, C. ginsengisoli clade species were enriched in genes for heme oxygenase and for a bacteriophytochrome (annotated on  as diguanylate cyclase), which were detected using both COG20 and KOfam database annotation. Consensus protein sequences for genes related to these functions, when aligned to the  database, most closely match to the genome of Paenibacillus chitinolyticus (after matches to members of the C. ginsengisoli clade); heme oxygenase and diguanylate cyclase are located one after the other in the assembled chromosome of this species (NZ_CP026520.1). Heme oxygenase (HO-1) breaks down heme and releases iron and is a regulator of intracellular iron availability in plants and animals (Singh and Bhatla, 2022). Enhanced HO-1 expression in plants and animals is also associated with stress response as the resulting biliverdin and bilirubin scavenge ROS species (Singh and Bhatla, 2022); the bacterial species Paenibacillus polymyxa applied as a probiotic induces increased intestinal HO-1 expression as part of its anti-oxidant effects on gut health in animals (Wu et al., 2019). In bacteria, expression and production of heme oxygenase are associated with iron scavenging within a host, and heme oxygenase expression can have either beneficial anti-oxidant or enhanced pathogenic effects on plant or animal hosts (Richard et al., 2019). In non-photosynthetic bacteria, heme oxygenase also produces biliverdin which is used as the chromatophore in bacteriophytochromes (Takemoto et al., 2019). It is also possible that this HO-1/diguanylate cyclase complex acts as an oxygen sensor (Martínková et al., 2013). Other functions significantly enriched in this clade include stress response genes such as heat shock protein DnaJ. KEGG pathway analysis predicted two functional pathways in all C. ginsengisoli clade species which were not present in any other Cohnella species: a pathway for carbon fixation (incomplete reductive citrate cycle) and a pathway for plant terpenoid biosynthesis (specifically beta-carotene biosynthesis). Predictive analysis of the presence of CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes, Drula et al., 2022) was followed by ordination (Figure 7; Supplementary Figure S3) and heatmap generation (Supplementary Figure S4). Both heatmaps and ordinations show that strain F6_2S_P1T and its closest relatives cluster tightly together, along with C. fermenti (isolated from a fermented vegetable, Lin et al., 2020), C. phaseoli (isolated from the root nodule of a legume species, Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008), C. zeiphila (isolated from corn tissue, Johnson et al., 2021), and several undescribed strains; members of the C. ginsengisoli clade, therefore, appear to be both taxonomically similar and have similar profiles of carbohydrate-cycling genes. PERMANOVA analysis confirmed that the centroid of the C. ginsengisoli clade was significantly different from that of other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species (p < 0.001). One axis out of three in the NMDS ordination clearly differentiates the C. ginsengisoli clade and the other Cohnella species mentioned above from the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species (NMDS2, shown in Figure 7; Supplementary Figure S3); therefore, scores correlating CAZyme ordination vectors to this axis using the envfit function were assessed for significance, plotted, and ranked against the axis in question. Figure 7. Open in a new tab First two axes of NMDS ordination (standardization = “range,” distance = “Bray-Curtis,” maxit = 500, k = 3, stress = 0.129, R2 = 0.98) for counts of different predicted CAZymes in the genomes of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species. Also present in the figure are CAZyme vector correlations with axes 1 and 2 (not original coordinates) via envfit/Pearson's correlation with fdr correction + p < 0.01. Species belonging to the C. ginsengisoli clade and the top 4 CAZyme families/subfamilies positively correlated with axis 2 are labeled.Most strongly associated with this axis and the C. ginsengisoli clade are the CAZyme families CBM67 and GH78, which were both identified as part of the enzyme α-L-rhamnosidase which alters flavonoids and other rhamnose-containing glycosides such as pectins in plant cell walls (Yadav et al., 2010). Flavonoids are phenolic compounds produced by plants that often have medicinal or flavorful properties. α-L-rhamnosidase cleaves terminal α-rhamnose residues and in doing so helps concentrate and improve the action of flavonoids; α-L-rhamnosidase from different bacterial species is used for many industrial applications such as improving wine aroma, sweetening fruit juice, and increasing concentration and efficacy of antibiotic and anti-cancer compounds (Xie et al., 2022). The C. ginsengisoli clade and other Cohnella species enriched in α-L-rhamnosidase enzyme modules are all confirmed or likely plant symbionts or feed on plant tissue; however, since the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species appear to have at least some association with plant tissue or rhizosphere, there may be additional promising applications for these particular species in processing plant medicinal or other plant phenolic compounds. CAZymes negatively associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade (and associated mainly with Paenibacillus species) include chitosanases (GH46 and CBM12), endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GH85), and β-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GT17). Four CAZyme families associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species had an effect size of 0.5 or greater (Kruskal–Wallis); these were maltooligosaccharide-producing α-amylases (CG13_5), chondroitin AC lyase (PL8_3), and alginate lyases (PL34 and PL14_3).Presence of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T in ISS metagenomes Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces, crew capsule, and ISS HEPA filter particulates (Venkateswaran et al., 2014; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022) were mapped to the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Most metagenomes had <0.05% of reads that mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1T, with a maximum of 0.22% of reads mapping to strain F6_2S_P_1T for a low-read-number sample collected from the cupola of the ISS during Flight 4 of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series. But upon examination of regions to which the metagenomic reads mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1T, 98+% of reads mapped to regions of 16S or 23S rRNA genes and were only considered significant by bowtie2 because of the conserved nature of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes. We therefore concluded that strain F6_2S_P_1T is not dominant in the ISS environmental surfaces or air particulates collected during the Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 mission series. However, molecular microbial diversity-based examination of plant and its associated materials using culturing and metagenomics would allow NASA to trace the source of this strain, since Cohnella species were reported to produce hormones that might promote growth of plants. For example, as mentioned above, Cohnella was an abundant genus in the microbiome of healthy plant tissue of chili plants grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2022).Conclusion We used multiple means of characterization, including phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional genome-prediction methods to characterize Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and place it within the established taxonomy of the genus Cohnella. Based on these data, we propose that this novel species be named C. hashimotonis. We also characterized the branch of Cohnella within which C. hashimotonis is placed and predicted functional characteristics of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade as a whole. All species of Cohnella closely related to C. hashimotonis are from the plant/rhizosphere environment and likely have mutualistic associations with plant roots or other tissue. It is likely, therefore, that C. hashimotonis was introduced to the ISS not as a human commensal but as a plant commensal during one of the many plant growth experiments conducted on board. Nevertheless, C. hashimotonis can clearly survive in the extreme conditions of the ISS built environment, including radiation exposure, desiccation, low nutrient availability, and microgravity, and is closely related to a number of rhizosphere bacteria; it is therefore a promising candidate for testing as a member of plant-growth-promoting consortia for future plant experiments in outer space.Description of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. Cohnella hashimotonis (ha.shi.mo.to.nis. masc. n. hashimotonis named in honor of Professor Hideo Hashimoto, a food microbiologist from Hiroshima Univ., Japan). Cells are endospore-forming, aerobic, and gram-positive rods, 0.5–0.6 μm in width and 0.8–100+ μm in length. In addition to normal cells, elongated, spaghetti-like cells (Figures 4D, 5B) are observed in light microscopy and SEM images. Colonies are translucent cream-colored, acquiring a pinkish tinge after multiple days of growth, and grow well on R2A but poorly on TSA. Growth occurs at between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies are weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. This species reduces nitrate to nitrite, produces dextrin from starch, and utilizes the following carbon substrates: alanine, histidine, serine, sucrose, L-arabinose, melibiose, D-fructose, inositol, and lactose. The following substances are utilized for acid production: maltose, sucrose, D-fructose, D-ribose, N-acetyl, glucosamine, lactose, and trisodium citrate. Major fatty acids composing C. hashimotonis are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%). The polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three aminophospholipids, and a phospholipid. The major quinone system is menaquinones MK-7. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid. C. hashimotonis is closely related to C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli based on 16 rRNA gene sequence similarity (<99%). However, the phylogenetic position of the strain F6_2S_P_1T was resolved as a novel species due to gyrB sequence similarity (<94%), ANI (<89%), and dDDH (<35%) analyses with any other sequenced Cohnella species. GC content is 58.37%. The type strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment, i.e., the space toilet, aboard the ISS, in 2018; its genome is available on , accession number JAGRPV000000000. The type strain F6_2S_P_1T is submitted to two culture collections (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T).Data availability statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Klebsiella species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, are opportunistic pathogens that commonly cause infections in humans. Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is a subgroup of K. pneumoniae, which has gained attention due to its global dissemination, its capacity to cause invasive infections in community settings among immunocompetent individuals, and its escalating antibiotic resistance levels. Our study presents the first comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic analysis including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of Klebsiella isolates from the International Space Station (ISS). The genomes of K. pneumoniae, K. aerogenes, and K. quasipneumoniae offered insights into their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, disinfectant resistance, and MGEs. All isolates were part of emerging pathogenic lineages with K. quasipneumoniae ST138 presenting spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, possibly due to its genotypic profile encoding for numerous resistance genes to disinfectants and heavy metals. We also report on the isolation of a yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae, belonging to the emerging high-risk ST101 clone, aboard the ISS. A potential dissemination of hvKp strains on ISS might pose a risk to the immunocompromised crew members. Moreover, MGEs containing virulent loci could enable horizontal gene transfer to other benign microorganisms on the ISS, possibly enhancing their virulence potential. Additionally, some Klebsiella genomes exhibited genetic divergence from their respective lineages, which we hypothesize results from the unique spaceflight associated environmental pressures. These findings underscore the need to monitor microbial communities in space to comprehend their survival mechanisms and implications for human health. IMPORTANCE The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique, hermetically sealed environment, subject to environmental pressures not encountered on Earth, including microgravity and radiation (cosmic ionising/UV). While bacteria's adaptability during spaceflight remains elusive, recent research suggests that it may be species and even clone-specific. Considering the documented spaceflight-induced suppression of the human immune system, a deper understanding of the genomics of potential human pathogens in space could shed light on species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological significance. In this study, we used hybrid assembly methods and comparative genomics to deliver a comprehensive genomic characterization of 10 Klebsiella isolates retrieved from the ISS. Our analysis unveiled that Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ST138 demonstrates both spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, showing evidence of genomic divergence from its Earth-based ST138 lineage. Moreover, we characterized plasmids from Klebsiella species of ISS origin, which harbored genes for disinfectant resistance and enhanced thermotolerance, suggestin possible adaptive advantages. Furthermore, we identified a mobile genetic element containing a hypervirulence-associated locus belonging to a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate of the “high-risk” ST101 clone. Our work provides insights into the adaptability and persistence of Klebsiella species during spaceflight, highlighting the importance of understanding the dynamics of potential pathogenic bacteria in such environments.KEYWORDS: hypervirulence, Klebsiella, microgravity, International Space Station",

These findings underscore the need to monitor microbial communities in space to comprehend their survival mechanisms and implications for human health. IMPORTANCE The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique, hermetically sealed environment, subject to environmental pressures not encountered on Earth, including microgravity and radiation (cosmic ionising/UV). While bacteria's adaptability during spaceflight remains elusive, recent research suggests that it may be species and even clone-specific. Considering the documented spaceflight-induced suppression of the human immune system, a deper understanding of the genomics of potential human pathogens in space could shed light on species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological significance. In this study, we used hybrid assembly methods and comparative genomics to deliver a comprehensive genomic characterization of 10 Klebsiella isolates retrieved from the ISS. Our analysis unveiled that Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ST138 demonstrates both spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, showing evidence of genomic divergence from its Earth-based ST138 lineage. Moreover, we characterized plasmids from Klebsiella species of ISS origin, which harbored genes for disinfectant resistance and enhanced thermotolerance, suggestin possible adaptive advantages. Furthermore, we identified a mobile genetic element containing a hypervirulence-associated locus belonging to a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate of the “high-risk” ST101 clone. Our work provides insights into the adaptability and persistence of Klebsiella species during spaceflight, highlighting the importance of understanding the dynamics of potential pathogenic bacteria in such environments.KEYWORDS: hypervirulence, Klebsiella, microgravity, International Space StationINTRODUCTION The genus Klebsiella includes eight species of facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria ubiquitously found in natural environments (1). They can also be found as human and animal gastrointestinal commensals. Some Klebsiella species are well-established human opportunistic pathogens known to cause both community and hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) (2, 3). Klebsiella pneumoniae, is the most clinically significant Klebsiella species, exhibiting a multifaceted pathogenicity profile that encompasses urinary tract infections (UTIs), meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis (4). Its multidrug resistance (MDR), extended drug resistance (XDR), and association with hypervirulent (hvKp) lineages, which cause outbreaks in both community and healthcare environments, make it a notable concern (5, 6). The dispersal of hvKp lineage strains is of increasing concern to the medical community (7). HvKp differs from classic K. pneumoniae (cKp) due to its ability to infect immunocompetent individuals in community settings. Infections associated with hvKp commonly affect multiple sites due to metastatic spread (8). Although there is not a clear definition for hvKp, there are several siderophore virulence factors (VFs) reported to be associated with a hvKp pathotype, mainly aerobactin (iuc), salmochelin (iro), and yersiniabactin (ybt) (9, 10). Recently, Kleborate, a genotyping tool has been developed to assess and quantify virulence among the K. pneumoniae species complex using a five-tier scoring system based on the presence of key virulence-associated loci (10).These virulence loci are commonly identified on mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as self-mobilizable plasmids and integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Within K. pneumoniae populations, ICEKp is known to mobilize the ybt locus, which encodes for the key iron scavenging virulence factor yersiniabactin along with its receptor (11). Besides virulence factors, capsular serotypes K1 and K2 are more frequently encountered in hvKp (12). Other capsular types, such as KL106, are associated with globally disseminated pathogenic K. pneumoniae lineages, although their structures remain undetermined (13). Other Klebsiella species are also known to cause HAIs but rarely infect immunocompetent individuals outside of healthcare-associated settings. Klebsiella aerogenes is typically associated with HAIs in immunocompromised patients and infections primarily include pneumonia, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and UTIs (14). K. aerogenes is known to produce a chromosomal cephasolosporinase (AmpC) exhibiting resistance to penicillins, first and second-generation cephalosporins, cephamycins as well as monobactams but at a hydrolysis rate <1% of that observed for benzylpenicillin (15, 16). AmpC β-lactamases are not inhibited by β-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid, and as such, β-lactamase inhibitor combinations are not recommended for the treatment of K. aerogenes-associated infections (17). Klebsiella quasipneumoniae is further classified into two subspecies K. quasipneumoniae subsp. quasipneumoniae and K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae. Both subspecies have now been recognized as human opportunistic pathogens (18). Recent reports have implicated K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae as a causative agent of neonatal septicemia outbreaks in China and Nigeria, emphasizing the need for heightened surveillance (19, 20). The International Space Station (ISS) is an extreme hermetically sealed environment, which puts microorganisms under the unique selective pressures of microgravity and radiation (cosmic ionizing/UV). During the Microbial Tracking-1 experiment, which was dedicated to characterizing the ISS microbiome, 10 strains belonging to three different Klebsiella species were identified, namely K. pneumoniae, K. quasipneumoniae, and K. aerogenes (21). These Klebsiella isolates were retrieved from the Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC), Cupola, the Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module, Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), and Lab 3 of the ISS. Using culture-independent methods, it has been reported that K. pneumoniae can be identified in multiple locations on the ISS, with documented succession over time (22, 23). K. pneumoniae exhibited noticeable persistence between different flights among propidium monoazide-treated surface samples. Additionally, metabolic modeling indicated that Klebsiella species play a key role in the ISS microbiome, benefiting co-existing microorganisms (e.g., Pantoea species). It was also found that K. pneumoniae displays parasitic interactions with Aspergillus species and amensalistic interactions with Penicillium species. The overall importance of understanding the genomic background, evolution, and persistence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms during spaceflight, in terms of medical astromicrobiology, has also been recently discussed (24). The aim of this research communication is twofold: first, to generate complete genomes and circular chromosomal maps of the 10 Klebsiella strains isolated from the ISS, investigating their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, heavy metal resistance, and MGEs and would provide the first complete Klebsiella plasmids from the ISS. Secondly, to employ large-scale population genomics to understand the evolutionary paths and potential divergences of the ISS Klebsiella isolates from the Earth-based lineages.RESULTS Antimicrobial susceptibility testing As expected, the Klebsiella isolates (n=10) exhibited resistance to ampicillin and rifampicin. Among the strains, three displayed resistance to a second-generation cephamycin (cefoxitin), five exhibited intermediate susceptibility to nalidixic acid, two to aminoglycosides (kanamycin), and one to sulphonamides (Table S1).Assembly statistics Using hybrid assembly methods with data from both Illumina and ONT sequencing platforms, circular plasmid and closed chromosomal genomes were possible for all isolates. The assembly statistics are provided in Table S2. A direct genomic comparison of the chromosomes of all 10 ISS Klebsiella strains is shown in Fig. 1A. Fig 1.

(D) Depicts the 5.769 Kb plasmid pIIF7SW-P1_2 retrieved from K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1. Coding sequences are colored per COG function.Genome typing Genotyping-based sequence type (ST) characterization identified four different STs among the strains. The most common ST among the K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae was ST138 (7/8 K. quasipneumoniae strains). These strains uniformly exhibited K48 and O5 locus alleles. Strain IIIF3SW-P1 was identified as ST3234 displaying K16 and O3 surface antigens. The K. pneumoniae strain F3-2P (2) belongs to the ST101 lineage with KL106 and O1/O2v2, while K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 to the ST103 lineage presenting KL119 and O3/O3a (Table S3).Plasmid characterization K. pneumoniae strain F3-2P (2) was found to possess a 216.722 Kb, IncFIIK (FIIK-9 allele) conjugative plasmid encoding for 234 coding sequences (CDSs; Fig. 1B). Key functionalities of this plasmid mainly include gene clusters associated with heavy-metal resistance and thermoresistance. Genes responsible for mercuric resistance (merA), arsenical resistance (arsA/B/C), copper resistance (copA/B/D/R), copper and silver export system (cusA/B/C/F/R/S), and genes that enable cell growth at high temperatures (cplC, htpX) were present. K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 was identified to carry two previously unidentified plasmids: pIIF7SW-P1_1 is a 28.614 Kb, low copy (0.68 copies per cell), mobilizable plasmid identified to contain 38 CDSs (Fig. 1C). pIIF7SW-P1_2 is a 5.796 Kb, high copy (16.10 copies per cell), non-mobilizable plasmid containing six CDSs (Fig. 1D; Table S4). pIIF7SW-P1_2 was found to encode for the heat shock gene htrC.Average nucleotide identity analysis of ISS isolates Average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis revealed that all K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae strains belonging to ST138 shared an ANI of >99.99% (99.998% ± 0.001%), indicating that they belong to the same clone that shows spatio-temporal persistence. Strain IIIF3SW-P1 (ST3234) shared an ANI of 99.148% ± 0.001% with the rest of K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae strains. K. pneumoniae strain F3-2P (2) and K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 were more genomically distant with respective ANIs of 93.237% ± 2.346% and 86.079% ± 0.041% when compared to the K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae strains (Fig. S1).Comparative genomics of K. pneumoniae ST101 The K. pneumoniae ST101 is a globally distributed clone with over 696 isolates reported in over 33 countries on the Pathogenwatch genomic surveillance database. K. pneumoniae ST101 is widely associated with hypervirulent pathotypes. Overall, the ST101 lineage genomes exhibited high genetic similarity (ANI > 99.4%; Fig. 2A) and are predominantly associated with Europe and South-East Asia (Fig. 2B). F3-2P (2), the strain from the ISS, is most closely related to ERR985162, a genome retrieved from sewage wastewater in the UK in 2014, with an ANI of 99.86%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that F3-2P (2) belongs to a distinct sub-clade within the ST101 lineage, along with 41 other genomes (Fig. 2C). Out of the 696 K. pneumoniae ST101 isolates reported worldwide, 87.07% (606/696) were found to carry the ybt gene cluster, which is a determinant of virulence associated with the presence of yersiniabactin, suggesting that yersiniabactin plays a key role in the pathogenicity of this clone. Among these isolates, only nine encoded for additional siderophore virulence factors such as colibactin or aerobactin. Moreover, 98.2% (595/606) of the ybt-positive genomes encoded for ybt9, as part of a horizontally acquired ICEKp3. The integrative conjugative element ICEKp5, which was identified in the ISS isolate F3-2P (2) and carries the ybt14 locus, is a rarity, identified in only four other ST101 genomes. Fig 2.

The associated ST103 isolates were geographically confined, with isolates obtained from human hosts in the USA (n = 4) and Japan (n = 1) (Fig. 3B). The genetically most akin to strain IIIF7SW-P1 was SRR5666484, which was isolated from a human with a urinary tract infection in the USA in 2015 (ANI = 99.97%). Based on core-genome phylogeny, IIIF7SW-P1 formed a distinct node within the ST103 clone along with uropathogenic strain SRR5666484. Fig 3.

For more details, an interactive dashboard is available here.Comparative genomics of K. quasipneumoniae ST3234 K. quasipneumoniae ST3234 is a seldom encountered clone with only two genomes listed in the Pathogenwatch database. The genomes of K. quasipneumoniae IIIF3SW-P1 and those of two strains from Oxford, England were found to be highly similar, with an ANI > 99.8% (Fig. 4A). The two UK strains were isolated from cases of invasive bloodstream infections (Fig. 4B). When analyzed using core-genome phylogenetics, IIIF3SW-P1 was part of a separate node from the two strains from Oxford (Fig. 4C). Fig 4.

(A) ANI between the genome of K. quasipneumoniae ISS strain IIIIF3SW-P1, the genome of K. quasipneumoniae typing strain 07A044, and all K. quasipneumoniae genomes of ST3234 (n = 2). (B) Temporal dissemination of the K. quasipneumoniae ST3234 genomes. (C) Core-genome phylogenetic relatedness of the K. quasipneumoniae ST3234 genomes. For more details, an interactive dashboard is available here.Comparative genomics of K. quasipneumoniae ST138 The K. quasipneumoniae ST138 lineage exhibits a broader spatial distribution and higher genetic diversity compared to ST3234, with ANI > 99.3% (Fig. 5A and B). The genome most closely related to the seven ISS K. quasipneumoniae ST138 isolates was that of ERR4635453, isolated from a human in Tacloban city, Philippines in 2017, with ANI = 99.77%. The ISS strains (n = 7) formed a distinct clade within the ST138 lineage based on core genome phylogeny, indicating potential evolutionary divergence from the main ST138 lineage. Fig 5. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic relationships within K. quasipneumoniae ST138.

For more details, an interactive dashboard is available here.Antimicrobial resistance genes The ISS strains (n = 10) were found to each carry an average of 22.70 ± 0.64 antimicrobial-resistance genes (ARGs) (Fig. 6A). Among the genomes, K. pneumoniae F3-2P(2) (ST101) was identified to carry the β-lactamase gene blaSHV-1, which is known to confer resistance to certain penicillin and first-generation cephalosporin antibiotics (Fig. 6B). In the K. quasipneumoniae genomes of ST138, the chromosomal blaOKP-B-8 was identified. The genome of K. quasipneumoniae strain IIIF3SW-P1 (ST3234) was found to carry a blaOKP-B-3 allelic variant. The OKP-B chromosomal β-lactamase group is known to confer resistance mainly to aminopenicillins and carboxypenicillins and remains susceptible to the presence of inhibitors such as clavulanic acid (25). K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 (ST103) had three missense mutations in the outer membrane protein encoding ompK gene, which are linked with increased resistance to cephalosporins and cephamycins explain the observed phenotypic resistance to cefoxitin (Table S5). Fig 6. Open in a new tab Genetic determinants of resistance and virulence. (A) Total number of ARGs identified per ISS-originating Klebsiella strain. (B) Heatmap distribution of ARGs per isolate. (C) Total number of VFs identified per ISS-originating Klebsiella strain. (D) Heatmap distribution of VFs per isolate.Genetic determinants of virulence The ISS strains (n = 10) encoded for an average of 54.20 ± 8.95 VF genes each (Fig. 6C). The genome of K. pneumoniae F3-2P (2) encoded for 75 VFs, amonst which were the virulence loci for enterobactin and yersiniabactin. The yersiniabactin pathogenicity island (ybt-14 lineage) was part of a self-mobilizable ICE (ICEKp5) of 63.441 Kb. The ybtQ gene amplicon (234 bp) was also detected using a multiplex PCR assay for the F3-2P (2) strain. Moreover, the iron regulatory protein-encoding genes irp1 and irp2 were identified as part of the same ICEKp5. Consequently, strain F3-2P (2) received a virulence score of 1/5 based on Kleborate’s scoring system (10). The wb gene cluster relating to O1 antigen production, commonly found in clinical isolates, was also identified in strain F3-2P (2). Furthermore, all 10 ISS Klebsiella genomes encoded for the virulence-associated enterotoxin (entA/B/C/E/F). K. quasipneumoniae strain IIIF3SW-P1 (ST3234) encoded for the enterotoxin entD and wcaG/H/I/J, a gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of the outer core lipopolysaccharide. K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 was the only strain identified to contain the flgH/G/M/N genes, which encode for regions of the bacterial flagellar switch protein (Fig. 6D).DISCUSSION This study highlights the presence of Klebsiella isolates associated with human pathogenic lineages. It also reports on the first identification of a yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae and associated Klebsiella plasmids aboard the ISS. Of note, isolate F3-2P (2) belongs to the emerging nosocomial high-risk clone ST101, which is linked with carbapenem and colistin resistance and exhibits a hvKp pathotype (26, 27). The ST101 clone has been implicated in numerous outbreaks of bloodstream infections worldwide, including in southern Italy and India (28, 29). With isolates reported from over 33 countries, ST101 poses a persistent public health concern and ST101 induced infections have been associated with 11% increased mortality compared to non-ST101 infections (30). Widely disseminated, high-risk clones like ST101 are known to be able to horizontally acquire hypervirulence gene clusters, potentially precipitating the emergence of hypervirulent clonal lineages (31). In line with this, our analysis suggests that the predominant virulence factor associated with ST101 is yersiniabactin, as part of a horizontally acquired and self-mobilizable ICEKp. K. pneumoniae strain F3-2P (2) was identified to encode for 75 VF genetic determinants, including the siderophore genes (irp1/2), the enterobactin gene cluster, and the yersiniabactin (ybt-14) gene cluster as part of a self-mobilizable ICEKp5. K. pneumoniae clinical isolates harboring yersiniabactin on ICEKp5 are known to prevail in intensive care units and tertiary hospital settings and are linked with invasive infections (32 – 34). Among the 696 ST101 genomes available on the Pathogenwatch surveillance database, only four esxhibited the same ICEKp5 harboring the ybt-14 gene cluster. These strains were distributed widely in different countries such as the USA, China, and the Philippines. The mode of transportation of a potential pathogen such as K. pneumoniae F3-2P (2) to the ISS could be through cargo or crew, although relevant crew data were not available as NASA does not mandate the monitoring of microbial diversity. Similar to screening and surveillance protocols in clinical settings, targeted screening of cargo and crew for potential opportunistic pathogens could mitigate any putative pathogen-associated risks. The genome of K. pneumoniae strain F3-2P (2) also revealed the presence of an IncFIIK conjugative plasmid containing several heavy-metal resistance and thermoresistance genes. Although ESBL CTX-M-15-encoding plasmids are commonly associated with the FIIK-9 replicon, the plasmid of F3-2P (2) lacked ESBLs likely due to the absence of antibiotic-induced selective pressure (35). This strain was isolated from the WHC of the ISS. The role of the WHC is the removal and containment of human solid waste and urine. While it is unclear if the strain originated from the ISS crew or cargo, K. pneumoniae strains have been reported to survive on surfaces for up to 6 weeks, with the longest survival rates observed for stainless steel (36, 37). When a uman infection is established with hvKp isolates, while both enterobactin and yersiniabactin virulence loci are present, it has been demonstrated that could result in multi-site infection due to metastatic spread (38). Furthermore, the hypervirulent, multimetal resistance, and thermotolerant genomic profile of the K. pneumoniae F3-2P (2) strain could possibly allow it to evade the existing disinfecting protocols aboard the ISS. Further work is required to clarify the phenotypic translation of these genotypic traits. The presence of the resistance and hypervirulence determinants in MGEs further poses a consideration for their dissemination across the ISS microbiome. The persistence of K. quasipneumoniae ST138 in the ISS environment was evidenced by the isolation of seven strains over 18 months from three different locations (Permanent Multipurpose Module, Cupola, and WHC). Despite the spatial and temporal distribution of their collection, the ST138 strains showed remarkable genetic similarity, suggesting the possible propagation of a single clone in the closed system for a prolonged period. The genomes of the ST138 isolates shared several chromosomal genetic determinants of resistace, including these encoding for resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), peroxide, fosmidomycin, methyl viologen, tellurite, nickel, cobalt, zinc, and the multiple stress-resistance protein BhsA encoded by bhsA. These determinants may confer adaptability advantages to the ST138 lineage during spaceflight, given most cleaning agents and disinfectants contain several of these heavy metals and QACs. On Earth, K. quasipneumoniae ST138 strains have been isolated from untreated and treated water in a wastewater treatment plant in Slovenia (38). ESBL cefotaximase (CTXM-9)-producing strains of K. quasipneumoniae ST138 have also been reported to cause community-onset infections in China (38). Overall, K. quasipneumoniae ST138 shows temporal and spatial persistence within the ISS environment, more than any other Klebsiella lineage. The ISS K. quasipneumoniae ST138 strains lacked any MGEs and, therefore, their adaptability advantage is likely ntrinsic. Further research is required to elucidate the properties of this lineage, which allow it to adapt and propagate to the high-pressure environment of the ISS. K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae strain IIIF3SW-P1 was the only ST3234 strain identified on ISS, and it was isolated from the crew exercise platform (ARED). There is not much known about the dissemination and persistence of K. quasipneumoniae ST3234 as only two isolates have been reported on surveillance databases. Both Earthly strains were associated with invasive bloodstream infections in humans and were isolated at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, UK between 2009 and 2012. K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 (ST103) was isolated from the ISS Lab3 in 2015. This strain belongs to the globally rare K. aerogenes ST103 lineage, with only five strains deposited in the Pathogenwatch database, all of which are associated with UTIs and reported in the USA. K. aerogenes IIIF7SW-P1 presented phenotypic resistance to ampicillin and the second generation cephamycin cefoxitin as expected, given the intrinsic resistance of K. aerogenes due to the presence of a chromosomal ampC. The isolate was susceptible to the third generation cephalosporin cefpodoxime and to the cefpodoxime/clavulanic acid combination tested. This is in liaison with the literature supporting that only overproduction of AmpC is linked with resistance to third generation cephalosporins (39). Interestingly, IIIF7SW-P1 harbored two uncharacterized plasmids, one of which (pIIF7SW-P1_1) was predicted to be mobilizable and contained the pilL gene responsible for thin pilus biogenesis (40). PilL is known to promote bacterial adhesion and colonization, providing a selective advantage in the high-selective-pressure environment of the ISS. The second plasmid (pIIF7SW-P1_2) was a high copy plasmid, harboring the heat shock gene htrC, which has been linked with increased thermoresistance in E. coli (41). The genetic makeup of IIIF7SW-P1 suggests that it may have acquired plasmids enabling it to survive and persist in the challenging conditions of the ISS, which warrants further investigation. In sumary, this study provides a first complete genomic characterization of Klebsiella strains isolated from the ISS . This study reports on the genomic makeup of 10 Klebsiella isolates, revealing an abundance of heavy metal and QAC-resistance genes amongst the genomes, similar to the ones seen in clinical settings where the use of disinfectants is intense (42). However, clinically relevant ESBLs and carbapenemase-producing genes were notably absent. This study reports on the isolation of a yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae from a human-associated pathogenic lineage aboard the ISS as well as on the persistence and possible genomic divergence of K. quasipneumoniae ST138 isolates. The prevalence and seemingly adaptability of K. quasipneumoniae ST138 in spaceflight conditions should be considered for further investigation. Additional epidemiological studies are needed to map and understand the prevalent Klebsiella lineages that could persist during prolonged spaceflight. Ongoing surveillance of potentially problematic STs is feasible on the ISS due to its small crew size and could help mitigate associated risks. These efforts will aid in developing suitable countermeasures for eradicating potentially problematic pathogens in closed habitats for future human missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of the strains from the ISS Various locations were sampled on the ISS using polyester wipes, and the metadata associated with the samples and their collections were published elsewhere (43). Briefly, each wipe was aseptically removed from the zip lock bag and transferred to a 500 mL bottle containing 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and concentrated with a concentrating pipette (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO, USA) using a 0.22 µm Hollow Fiber Polysulfone tips (Cat #: CC08022). Suitable aliquots (100 µL) of each sample were plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar in duplicate and incubated at 25°C for 7 days, and well-matured colonies were picked, archived in semisolid R2A (agar media diluted 1:10), and stored at room temperature. A loopful of purified microbial culture was directly subjected to PCR. The targeted fragment was amplified (colony PCR) to amplify the 1.5 kb 16S rRNA gene to identify the bacterial strains. The following primers were used for the 16S rRNA gene amplification: the forward primer, 27F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′), and the reverse primer, 1492R (5′-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′) (44, 45). The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 50 s, annealing at 55°C for 50 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min 30 s and finalized by extension at 72°C for 10 min. The sequencing was performed using 27F and 1492R primers, and the sequences were assembled using SeqMan Pro from DNAStar Lasergene Package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The bacterial sequences were searched against EzTaxon-e database (46) and the initial identification was based on the closest percentage similarity (>97%) to previously identified microbial type strains.DNA extraction and sequencing Cultures of the 10 Klebsiella strains were grown overnight on MacConkey agar plates at 37°C. DNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with no pre-enrichment steps. The extracted DNA was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA) and the dsDNA High Sensitivity kit (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA). DNA purity was evaluated by measuring the absorbance ratio at 260 and 280 nm (A260/280) on a Jenway Genova Nano Micro-volume Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). For sequencing, DNA samples with a suitable quantity (>12.5 ng/µL) and purity (A260/280 of 1.80–2.00) were selected for downstream processing. Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing was performed on these samples at Oxford’s Genomics Centre (PE150). In addition, long-read sequencing for the DNA of all 10 isolates was carried out using an Oxford MinION Mk1C platform with a R9.4.1 flow cell (Oxford, UK).Antimicrobial susceptibility testing Antimicrobial susceptibilities for the 10 Klebsiella spp. isolates were determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method for a range of 8 β-lactam and 10 non-β-lactam antibiotics as previously described (47) (Table S6). The diffusion test was performed on Mueller Hinton agar as a culture medium. Classification into susceptibility categories was determined using the clinical breakpoints provided for Enterobacterales defined by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (v.13.0, 2023) (48). For nalidixic acid and kanamycin, breakpoints provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (30th edition) were applied (49). K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were utilized as quality controls.Bioinformatic analysis Filtering and assembly For short reads, quality filtering and adapter trimming were carried out using fastp (v0.23.2) (50). Only reads with a Q score of over 20 were retained. For long reads, adapter trimming was conducted using Porechop (v0.2.4) (51). Trimmed long reads were quality filtered using filtlong (v0.2.1) and only reads of 1 kbp or more were retained. Hybrid genome assembly was conducted using the hybrid assembly pipeline Unicycler (v0.5.0) (52) with default settings. The quality of hybrid assemblies was assessed using QUAST (v5.2.0) (53). Closed genome assemblies were visualized using Bandage (v0.8.1) (54), separating chromosomal and plasmid sequences. Circular visualization of the chromosomes and plasmids coupled including COG classification of their genetic features was conducted using COGclassifier (v1.0.4) and MGCplotter (v1.0.1).Genomic characterization of resistance, virulence, and plasmids Genome comparison between the 10 ISS strains was also conducted using MGCplotter utilizing K. quasipneumoniae strain IF1SW-B2 as a reference genome (v1.0.1) (Fig. 1). The mobilization and conjugation potential of the plasmids were predicted using the Mobtyper tool from the MOB-suite software package (v3.1.0) (55). Plasmid ST was determined using the plasmidMLST (v2.0) tool. ANI analysis was carried out using ANIclustermap (v1.1.0). The bacterial chromosomes and plasmids identified were scanned for the presence of ARGs and VFs using Abricate (v.1.0.0) against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (card) (56) and the virulence factor database (vfdb) (57), respectively. Only results with coverage and identity >90% were considered. The presence of ICEs was assessed using VRprofile2 (58). Species identification, sequence typing, K and O locus typing, and quantification of the respective virulence and resistance scores were conducted using Kleborate (v2.2.0) (10) and Kaptive (v2.0.3) (59).Large scale comparative genomics To compare the ISS Klebsiella genomes with Earthly analogs of the same ST, all available genomes from the STs identified for the ISS strains were retrieved from the Pathogenwatch database (Table S6). Their assemblies were annotated using PROKKA (v1.14.5) (60). A pan-genome analysis for each ST, which included the corresponding ISS strains and the species typing strain, was conducted using roary (v3.11.2) (61). Core genome alignment was determined using mafft (v7.47.1) (62). Phylogenetic analysis was performed to infer the evolutionary relationships among the core gene sequences with RAxML (v.8.2.12) using the General Time Reversible-gamma model with rapid bootstrapping of 200 bootstrapping replicates (63). The presence-absence results from the pan-genome analysis and the phylogenetic tree generated were visualized using microreact (64). Data were also visualized using the R programming language. Dedicated dashboards per ST have been generated and are accessible : K. quasipneumoniae ST 3234; K. quasipneumoniae ST138; K. pneumoniae ST101 , K. aerogenes ST103. Phylogenetic trees displaying branch distances and bootstrap support values are presented in Fig. S2.Hypervirulence multiplex PCR assay An in-house developed and validated multiplex PCR assay, designed to detect hypervirulence in clinical K. pneumoniae isoalates, was used to verify the presence of yersiniabactin identified in strain F3-2P (2). The assay targets the ybtQ gene of the yersiniabactin gene cluster, the iucA gene of the aerobactin gene cluster, and the 16SrRNA gene as a positive control (Table S7). The multiplex PCR was conducted on a SensQuest Thermocycler with the following conditions: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C (15 s at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C) × 35.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Part of the research described in this manuscript was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with NASA.

    "abstract": "Abstract With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values, when compared to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for all species described here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (= NRRL B-65660T = DSM 115933T), Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (= NRRL B-65661T = DSM 115931T), Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT (= NRRL B-65662T = DSM 115932T), Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (= NRRL B-65663T = DSM 115940T), and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (= NRRL B-65664T = DSM 115943T). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions.

    "introduction": "Introduction Multiple low-Earth orbit and lunar orbit space habitats are being planned by governmental and commercial entities as part of the newly revitalized space industry in the 2020s. Cleaning practices and microbial monitoring to ensure crew safety will likely be based on information garnered from studies of the International Space Station (ISS), which is the only space habitat currently in orbit with a long-term history of human habitation. Surfaces of the crew resupply vehicles1 and cargo destined to the ISS are cleaned to minimize microbial contamination and protect crew health. Nevertheless, the constant presence of human crew members (approximately six at any given time) on the ISS may lead to the shedding of microorganisms onto its surfaces, potentially causing recontamination and becoming dominant members of the habitat’s microbiome2. As a result, ISS surfaces are required to be routinely (once a week) cleaned to maintain a low biomass level (< 104 CFU/100 cm2 bacteria and < 100 CFU/100 cm2 fungi)3. Despite this rigorous cleaning and maintenance, it has been reported that some resilient microbes, albeit in low numbers, have adapted to microgravity conditions and persist4. Examples are the discovery of a novel bacterial genus found repeatedly in metagenomes, which has subsequently been isolated from ISS surfaces during further sampling campaigns5, and the isolation of the same clonal strains of Acinetobacter pittii from ISS surfaces during different years and sampling campaigns6. Characterizing the genomes and adaptation mechanisms of rare or novel species that manage to recolonize ISS surfaces is important because rare species are more likely to have narrow niche breadth, and so are persisting due to adaptive mechanisms to the stresses of radiation, desiccation, and microgravity conditions rather than via generalist strategies. Such microbes are therefore also fertile grounds for biotechnology applications research. Characterizing novel microbial species on the ISS is crucial for monitoring microbial contamination and protecting astronaut health. The process of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species found on the ISS helps to identify potential pathogens, as well as to understand potential impact on the spacecraft and its equipment (for example, in biofouling). Easily detecting or identifying a potential microbial threat, whether it be to human health or to the operation of the spacecraft or space station, depends on having an up-to-date, comprehensive database of microbial genomes, their species identity and their phenotypic characteristics (for example, are they known to carry or easily acquire antimicrobial resistance genes, are they UV resistant, what types of surfaces are they more likely to be found on, etc.). This is particularly the case when genetic information about a microbial threat is collected via shotgun metagenomic sequencing rather than by whole genome sequencing of pure culture; in that case, accurate identification relies entirely on an accurate database. The process of characterizing the previously unsequenced cultivable microbiome of space habitats continues to reduce the amount of microbial ‘dark matter’ found in metagenomic sequencing results. In the ongoing Microbial Tracking (MT) investigation of the ISS7,8, out of 510 genomes sequenced, 56 microbial species have been isolated multiple times, representing 27 microbial genera (19 bacteria and 8 fungi). Dominant microbial species include bacterial genera Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Acinetobacter, yeast genus Rhodotorula, and fungal genera Penicillium, Aureobasidium, and Aspergillus9–25. In this communication, six strains isolated from various ISS environmental surfaces belonging to five novel bacterial species constituting four different genera (Arthrobacter, Leifsonia, Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina) are described. Since recent bacterial taxonomy heavily depends on genomic characterization, WGS of these novel species were generated and compared with publicly available genomes of closely related species. One of the objectives of this study was to establish these six strains as novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, physiological, and phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes) analyses were carried out. To discover the phylogenetic placement within their respective genera, we have employed multiple gene analyses and WGS-based phylogenies containing all shared single-copy core genes. The second objective was to quantify the abundance of these recently identified species in the metagenomes of ISS surfaces. Hence, an in-depth analysis was conducted on the metagenomes collected during seven different flight missions, consisting of 106 individual samples, to assess the presence and prevalence of the species. In addition, an attempt was made to generate metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) of these novel species from the ISS metagenomes. Finally, antiSMASH analysis was performed to identify, annotate, and analyze secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) in the genomes of these novel bacterial species. Specialized metabolites and natural products encoded by these novel bacterial BGCs might provide insight into how different bacterial species thrive and interact in ISS conditions.",

    "results": "Results The six strains isolated during this study belonged to five novel species spanning four bacterial genera. Among the six strains, four were non-spore-forming members and two strains formed endospores. Based on 16S rRNA gene similarities, not all strains were identified into a novel bacterial species, but ANI/dDDH analyses allowed them to be placed into five distinct bacterial species. They were: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT, Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT, Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T. In addition, the WGS of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was generated and compared with the genome of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T to identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits. Genome characteristics and relatedness indices Table 1 summarizes the assembly statistics for all six strains. The draft genomes of the novel bacterial species were assembled using high-quality sequences, and their assembly quality varied from a single contig to 49 scaffolds. The non-spore-forming strains had high GC contents, ranging from 68% to 71.4%, whereas spore-forming strains, such as P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (46.1%) and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (41.6%), had low GC content. The total number of predicted genes was 2166 for S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T and 4861 for P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. However, the non-spore-forming bacterial species had ~ 3444 to 3850 coding regions (Table 1). In addition to the novel species, the complete genome of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was generated and compared to S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T strain since both shared > 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities.

However, the gyrB gene sequence similarities of the novel species with the closely related species ranged from 88.6 to 92.8% and could serve as a genetic marker to distinguish the novel species. Moreover, ANI indices (< 95%) and dDDH values (< 70%) fell below the threshold levels of bacterial species identity and confirmed that the examined ISS strains were novel species. Table 2.

Phylogeny The comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences of A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, isolated from the air particles collected from ARED during Flight 2, revealed a high similarity (> 99.6%) to most established Arthrobacter species. This suggests that the 16S rRNA gene may not be an adequate marker for distinguishing members within this genus. However, upon analyzing the gyrB gene sequences of this phylogenetic clade, the similarity values were found to be below 85.9%. Furthermore, strain IIF3SC-B10T displayed low values for digital dDDH (24.5%) and ANI indices (82.9%). These findings provide additional evidence supporting its classification as a novel species. In the 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree encompassing all Arthrobacter species (Fig. 1A), with Micrococcus antarcticus as the outgroup, strain IIF3SC-B10T clustered together with officially named species such as A. agilis, A. cheniae, A. bussei, and A. antioxidans (Fig. 1A). However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 1B), constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 59 genomes containing 138 single-copy core genes common to all Actinobacteria, A. burdickii was found to be distinct from the A. ruber and A. cheniae clades. Instead, it exhibited closer similarity to the unrecognized species A. sedimenti (ANI 93.8%). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Arthrobacter species including strain IIF3SC-B10T based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 138 single-copy core genes of phylum Actinobacteria, keeping Kocuria rhizophila as an outgroup.The 16S rRNA gene sequences of L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT, isolated from crew quarters in Flight 6, exhibited > 98.9% similarity to L. soli and L. shinshuensis, indicating that the 16S rRNA gene is not a suitable marker for distinguishing members of this genus. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences of the members of this phylogenetic clade, the similarity values were below 91.7%. However, the strain F6_8S_P_1AT exhibited low dDDH values (< 28.3%) and ANI indices (86.3%), providing further evidence that it belongs to a novel species. In the 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree of all Leifsonia species, with Rathayibacter tritici as the outgroup, strain F6_8S_P_1AT was placed within a clade that also included the validly described species L. aquatica, L. xyli, L. lichenia, L. shinshuensis, and L. soli (Fig. 2A). However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 2B), which was constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters of eight available genomes containing a total of 138 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Actinobacteria, L. virtsii was separated from all these Leifsonia species. The next closest member was L. soli (ANI 86.3%). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Leifsonia species including strains F6_8S_P_1AT, F6_8S_P_1BT and F6_8S_P_1C based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 138 single-copy core genes of phylum Actinobacteria, keeping Nocardia fluminea as an outgroup.In addition to L. virtsii, two strains were identified as L. williamsii based on their gyrB sequence similarity (91.6%), ANI index (84.3%), and dDDH value (24.7%), which were below the species threshold level. Surprisingly, despite the high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between L. virtsii and L. williamsii (99.2%), the 16S rRNA gene tree (Fig. 2A) placed them in different clades, supported by 88% bootstrap values. Notably, the L. williamsii strains were isolated from the same crew quarter location as L. virtsii, and they even originated from the same culture plate of R2A medium. Initially, there was a suspicion that they might be clones from the same colony, but further analysis using WGS and gyrB sequencing confirmed that they were distinct novel species. In contrast to the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, the WGS-based tree (Fig. 2B) clearly differentiated L. williamsii from L. virtsii. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, isolated from the ARED’s surface during Flight 6, exhibited 99.5% similarity to P. pabuli, indicating that the 16S rRNA gene is not a suitable marker for distinguishing members of this genus. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences, P. pabuli also exhibited 94.9% similarity with P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. Since it was established that ~ 95% gyrB as cut-off value for species delineation, WGS was performed which showed that ANI index was only 88.4%. Based on low ANI index and dDDH value (34.6%), P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT is differentiated from P. pabuli and described as a novel species. The 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny (Fig. 3A) showed that P. xylanivrans, P. taichungensis, and P. paubli formed a tight clade with > 99% similarities among them. However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 3B), which was constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 244 genomes containing a total of 119 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Firmicutes, P. vandeheii was separated from all these Paenibacillus species and was found to be closer to the P. xylanivorans (ANI 92.8%). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Paenibacillus species including strain F6_3S_P_1CT based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 119 single-copy core genes of phylum Firmicutes, keeping Bacillus subtilis as an outgroup.The strain F6_3S_P_2T, another spore-forming bacterium belonging to the genus Sporosarcina and isolated from the ARED surface during Flight 6, displayed a 99.8% similarity to S. thermotolerans based on the 16S rRNA gene. This finding highlights the difficulty in classifying spore-forming microorganisms using the 16S rRNA gene marker. Hence, the WGS of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was needed to identify the phylogenetic position of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences, S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T exhibited an 87.0% similarity with S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T. Furthermore, the ANI index between the genomes of F6_3S_P_2T and S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was only 85.3%. Considering the low ANI index and dDDH value (29.8%), S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T can be identified as a novel species, distinct from S. thermotolerans. In the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny (Fig. 4A), S. thermotolerans, S. luteola, and S. saromensis formed a closely related clade with > 99% similarities among them. However, S. koreensis did not cluster within this clade, despite having a 16S rRNA gene similarity with S. highlanderae. On the other hand, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 4B), constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 15 genomes containing 119 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Firmicutes, S. highlanderae was separated from all other Sporosarcina species. Instead, it exhibited closer similarity to S. thermotolerans (ANI 85.3%). Figure 4.

Phenotypic characterization The cell size (Fig. 5), colony morphology, biochemical characteristics based on Vitek-2 (Supplemental Table S1) and BioLog GNIII (Supplemental Table S2), fatty acid profiles (Supplemental Table S3) and chemotaxonomic features (Supplemental Figure S1) of all five novel species are presented. A. burdickii can be phenotypically differentiated from other closely related Arthrobacter species since maltose, trehalose, cellobiose, turanose, and acetoacetic acid were not utilized as sole carbon substrate (Table 3). The Leifsonia species did not show any specific phenotypic characteristics that could be used to differentiate them from other closely related Leifsonia species; hence, molecular phylogeny is essential (Table 4). P. vandeheii was able to grow at 8% NaCl which can be used as discriminative test. Oxidase test was also positive whereas P. tundrae, P. xylanexedens, and P. amylolitus were negative. In addition, P. vandeheii can be differentiated by the utilization of Tween 40, turanose, γ-hydroxybutyric acid, l-malic acid, and l-serine as sole carbon source from P. taichungensis and P. paubli which are negative (Table 5).

Additionally, A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T was found to possess a significant amount of an unidentified phospholipid (PL1), a characteristic that sets it apart from Leifsonia species.

Abundance of novel species in ISS metagenomes We conducted an analysis of metagenomic reads obtained from two microbial tracking (MT) missions, encompassing seven flights across eight locations on the ISS, with the objective of identifying novel microbial species and potentially retrieving MAGs. To assess the presence of viable and intact cells of the novel species, we utilized propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment on the samples as previously described7,8. Our findings revealed that the majority of the metagenomes had less than 0.1% of their total reads mapped to the novel species. Among all the species analyzed, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited the highest mapping, with a maximum of 1.05% of total reads from a sample collected during Flight 2 near the port crew quarters (location 8) during MT-1. Therefore, we can conclude that none of these novel species are dominant in the ISS. Considering the limited proportion of reads mapped to the novel species, we proceeded to perform read assembly to explore the breadth of coverage against the isolated genomes. Interestingly, reads mapped to L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT and L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT from Flight 6 at location 8 exhibited a breadth of coverage of 59.4% and 80.7% respectively, despite representing a small fraction of the total reads (Fig. 6). However, apart from these cases, the overall breadth of coverage for the genomes was quite low, averaging at 0.21% hence, no MAG was generated. We also analyzed the PMA untreated samples and observed the similar pattern in the distribution of the breadth of coverages. Additionally, we noticed 84.4% breadth of coverage for L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT during Flight 7 at location 8 from where the strain was isolated. Despite the presence of a high breadth of coverage for Leifsonia genomes across multiple samples, we were unable to obtain MAGs due to the failure of achieving the minimum coverage depth threshold of 4X. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Box plots showing breadth of coverage of the consensus genome constructed from mapped reads aligned to the novel species (percent coverage was less than 1% in all cases). Due to high variations in the breadth of coverages of Leifsonia genomes, a broken Y-axis was used. The reads were collected from eight locations on the ISS across seven separate time points/flights as part of the Microbial Tracking project(s). Functional characterization of the novel species To investigate the genetic characteristics of the six novel strains, we performed a comprehensive genome annotation using RAST-tk (Table 7; Supplemental Table S4). The subsystem mapping results are as follows: A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (283 subsystems), L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (273 subsystems), L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT (262 subsystems), L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1CT (262 subsystems), P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (324 subsystems), and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (307 subsystems). Among the annotated subsystems, the top categories based on average gene counts included amino acids and derivatives (260 genes), carbohydrate metabolism (232 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (136 genes), and protein metabolism (171 genes).

Two mechanisms were predicted as the primarily function of these genes: resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and invasion and intracellular resistance. A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, in particular, is the only species that harbors the sarcosine oxidase (EC 1.5.3.1) gene, which is involved in the osmotic stress response. On the other hand, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T, both belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, possess a specific mechanism to respond to bacitracin-induced stress through the bceABRS four-component system. Notably, these two species also possess additional stress response mechanisms for periplasmic stress via the intramembrane protease RasP/YluC. While exploring other factors, it was observed that A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T does not possess any genes associated with motility. However, the other novel species have genes related to motility, including flagellar biosynthesis proteins. Among all the species, only P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT has the chemotaxis subsystem. We conducted further investigations into the metabolic potential of these novel species and made some noteworthy observations. A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T was found to possess a significantly higher number of genes related to aromatic compound metabolism, while having fewer genes associated with iron metabolism compared to the other species characterized in this study. With the exception of P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, all the other species exhibited the capability to perform polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism. However, only P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, due to the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2), can utilize glutathione as a sulfur source. Considering the concerns regarding spore-forming bacteria and their resistance to sterilization processes in the ISS, we further explored the spore-forming capabilities of these novel species. As expected, a significant number of genes associated with dormancy and sporulation were predicted in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T genomes. Between them, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited the highest number of 40 genes, primarily associated with spore germination and spore maturation processes. In contrast, the other species are non-spore forming and do not possess specific proteins associated with sporulation. Antimicrobial resistance properties of the novel species In the isolated five novel species, we searched for antibiotic resistance genes against the CARD database60 and calculated the percentage identity with the reference sequences. Overall, these genomes showed potential resistance to seven drug classes, including rifamycin and tetracycline antibiotics. Interestingly, we found that all of these genomes contained genes from vancomycin resistance gene clusters with an identity ranging from 30.7% to 51.5%. Among other identified resistance genes, we discovered the presence of rifampicin monooxygenase (RIFMO) in Leifsonia species with a 63% match, which catalyzes the inactivation of the antibiotic rifampicin. In P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, we identified a set of markers, including Llm 23S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase (LlmA_23S_CLI) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), which exhibited high sequence identities of 84.67% and 87.91%, respectively. LlmA_23S_CLI was originally detected in Paenibacillus sp. LC231, a strain isolated from Lechuguilla Cave, NM, USA61. Additionally, strain F6_3S_P_1CT was found to possess two genes, qacG and qacJ, which are part of a small multidrug resistance efflux pump conferring resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). Furthermore, in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T, we identified the presence of tetracycline-resistant ribosomal protection genes tetB(P) and tet(Q), respectively, with approximately 30% similarity. These provide resistance by preventing the binding of the antibiotic tetracycline to the bacterial ribosome. Moreover, these genomes also encode orthologues of the antibiotic-inactivating enzyme fosfomycin thiol transferase. The genomic mining predicted the presence of AMR genes but the confirmation of the phenotypic resistance requires further investigation. Production of secondary metabolites To explore the potential for producing secondary metabolites in the newly discovered species, we utilized antiSMASH, a bioinformatics tool for predicting putative BGCs. This analysis revealed a total of 16 cluster types, including βlactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters (Table 8). In A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, we identified a moderately matched thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161, known for its effectiveness against multidrug-resistant Gram-stain-positive bacteria and fungi62. Furthermore, in the isolated Leifsonia species, we found two well-known gene clusters: T3PKS-alkylresorcinol and NAPAA (non-α poly-amino acids) ε-Poly-l-lysine (ε-PL), both with a 100% match. Among the analyzed species, Leifsonia species shared a partially matched carotenoid BGC with P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. However, several unique cluster types, including cyclic-lactone-autoinducer, lanthipeptide, lassopeptide, NRP-metallophore, opine-like-metallophore, and proteusin, were identified exclusively in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. Notably, within the F6_3S_P_1CT strain, we also identified BGCs paeninodin (60%) and bacillopaline (100%). Lastly, S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T exhibited one phosphonate, one T3PKS, and one terpene BGC, although these clusters have not yet been fully characterized. Table 8.

    "discussion": "Discussion New launch technology and new investment in human exploration of space by governments and private industry are leading to a revitalization of the idea of long-term space habitation. Missions to the moon are already underway, and missions to Mars are planned for the near future. Such missions will be measured in multiple years rather than in months and will have no or little resupply from Earth. In such cases, the microbiome of the space vessel or habitat will need to be monitored for multiple reasons: the spread of pathogens through the air or on surfaces which could infect humans63 or plants64 as well as the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes65, the health of human commensal microbiomes (and potential overgrowth of secondary pathogens), and the potential for biofouling of fluid lines or water supplies via microbial overgrowth66. Also, with no resupply from Earth there is no ability to gain access to Earth’s massive microbial biodiversity. Unless specific microbes are stocked as supplies before launch1, the microbes found on the spacecraft or habitat are the only ones which could be used for the many commercial purposes that microbes are used for on Earth: antibiotic or therapeutic discovery, manufacturing of drugs, food, and vitamins, plant growth enhancement, probiotics, etc. Biological in-situ resource utilization may also require bioremediation or bioconversion of raw, potentially toxic materials collected from moons, other planets, or asteroids/comets. Whether or not the microbiome of a space habitat can be controlled and repurposed to this extent depends on a number of factors, including (1) whether the microbial diversity of such a space habitat would be sufficient to include all the traits desired for the many purposes listed above, (2) accurate detection and identification of already-known microbes and taxonomic placement of unidentified microbes, including whether shotgun metagenomic sequencing would detect the presence of problematic microbes from low biomass surfaces, and (3) characterization of potential phenotypic traits based on genomic predictions. Like the proverbial mustard seed, perhaps we inadvertently carry a planet’s worth of microbial diversity wherever we travel. The novel microbes described herein are not necessarily any more noteworthy than those which might be isolated from an office building on Earth [though they are likely far more resilient given the harsh conditions67 of the space environment], and yet each hosts significant potential for affecting human health5 or for use in assisting plant growth68, bioremediation or manufacturing, and offers a glimpse into the genetic and metabolic potential of the microbial diversity of the ISS69. The most abundant cultivable microbes on ISS surfaces include common, well-studied human commensals such as Staphylococcus, Rhodotorula, Penicillium, and Micrococcus species. However, there are many more that have only been isolated once aboard the ISS and which are at very low abundance—potentially shed from individual astronauts, from experiments such as plant grow-ins, from new pieces of cargo, or from the vast microbial diversity of the human gut—which can be considered a part of the rare microbiome. Although individually rare, members of this community collectively play significant roles in ecosystem functioning and stability, including functional redundancy which enhances the resilience and stability of ecosystems by ensuring that multiple microbial species can perform essential ecological functions, such as nutrient cycling, decomposition, and symbiotic interactions. The novel bacterial species described during this study belong to rare microbial species since their incidence in the shotgun metagenomes was very low, and only the two Leifsonia species had sufficiently high breadth of coverage of mapped metagenomic reads from the ISS crew quarters to have been definitively identified using shotgun metagenomic sequencing without culturing as well. Previous to using a WGS approach, the diversity of the ISS cultivable microbiome was significantly underestimated due to reliance on only 16S-based taxonomic identification. However, for many bacterial genera, 16S rRNA gene sequencing strategy fails to differentiate new species with significantly different phenotypic traits. For instance, there is 99.8% similarity between the 16S rRNA genes of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T and S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T, with a mere 3 base pair substitutions. Without access to the whole genome, S. highlanderae would be categorized as S. thermotolerans, even though it is not a thermophile. Upon accessing all 93 Sporosarcina genomes from the  database and generating an ANI heatmap (Supplemental Figure S2), it was evident that this clade contains at least five novel genera and 56 species which are yet to be described. This inference was based on ANI values of less than 70% for 14 Sporosarcina genomes, encompassing S. highlanderae, S. thermotolerans, and S. luteola and further emphasizes that the 16S rRNA gene on its own is not a reliable tool for differentiating among members of the Sporosarcina genus. Placing these 93 genomes into their phylogenetic affiliation require more study. Upon examining 337 ISS bacterial genomes (plus six novel strains) belonging to 36 bacterial species (plus five novel species), it was observed that non-dominant, rare, and phylogenetically undescribed species predicted to produce natural products. As their genetic and phenotypic potential remains uncharacterized, exploration of the rare microbiome can lead to the discovery of novel bioactive compounds, enzymes, and metabolic pathways. Many of these rare microorganisms have untapped biotechnological potential, with applications in fields such as medicine, agriculture, industry, and environmental remediation. Studying the rare microbiome can uncover valuable resources for the development of new biotechnological tools and processes. In the case of A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, we identified a moderately matched thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161, known for its efficacy against multidrug-resistant Gram-stain-positive bacteria and fungi62. Leifsonia species contain alkylresorcinol, which exhibits various activities including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and genotoxicity effects70. Additionally, alkylresorcinol plays a role in bacterial cyst formation during unfavorable environmental conditions71. On the other hand, ε-PL is responsible for antimicrobial activity against food spoilage and food-poisoning bacteria72. In addition, A. burdickii and P. vandeheii also harbor metal-dependent β-lactamase superfamily-I and III proteins, which are known for their involvement in the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics73. This enzyme family plays a significant role in conferring resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins. Furthermore, multidrug resistance efflux pumps such as the acriflavine resistance protein and Multidrug And Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) family of Multidrug Resistance (MDR) efflux pumps were found to be present in Leifsonia species and spore-formers. These efflux pumps contribute to bacterial resistance by actively pumping out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds from the cell, including antibiotics and toxic compounds, thereby reducing their intracellular concentrations and promoting bacterial survival. The acriflavin resistance protein (AcrA) is a crucial component of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, which confers resistance to acriflavin and other antimicrobial compounds. Its role in antibiotic resistance, multidrug efflux, intracellular homeostasis, biofilm formation, and potentially bacterial virulence underscores its significance in bacterial survival and adaptation. Understanding AcrA's function may aid in the development of strategies to combat antibiotic resistance and improve therapeutic approaches against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Given its involvement in antibiotic resistance and multidrug efflux, AcrA has emerged as a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents74. By inhibiting the function of AcrA or other components of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, it may be possible to overcome bacterial resistance and enhance the effectiveness of existing antibiotics. Identification of fosfomycin resistance protein (fosB) in both Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes in this study is crucial for effective infection control measures and the development of strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance. It has been reported that fosB is significant due to its impact on the treatment of bacterial infections, the emergence of multidrug resistance, the potential for horizontal gene transfer, and its implications for public health75. Streptothricin acetyltransferase was present in both Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes and it was reported that streptothricin is a valuable antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against microorganisms and can help reduce crop losses and increase agricultural productivity76. Its significance extends beyond its direct antimicrobial properties, finding applications in research, agriculture, and drug development. Understanding streptothricin's mode of action and resistance mechanisms contributes to our knowledge of antibiotics and aids in the development of novel strategies to combat bacterial infections. Streptothricin has shown efficacy in agricultural practices, particularly in plant and fungal disease management76. The ribosome protection-type tetracycline resistance-related proteins, group 2, are crucial determinants of resistance to tetracycline antibiotics in both Gram-stain-negative and positive microbes77. Their ability to protect ribosomes from the inhibitory effects of tetracycline enables microbial survival and growth in the presence of the antibiotic. The presence of these proteins in spore-forming novel species during this study and not in non-spore-forming bacteria needs further research. Choloylglycine hydrolase plays a critical role in bile acid metabolism, enterohepatic circulation, and the regulation of the bile acid pool78 and predicted only in the S. highlanderae genome. Its activity influences the composition and function of the gut microbiota and has implications for host health and disease79. Understanding the significance of this enzyme provides insights into bile acid metabolism disorders80 and potential therapeutic approaches for related conditions. Multiple genes for bioremediation of toxic material, enhanced plant growth, and survival in extreme conditions are predicted in the genomes of these novel species. Except for P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, all the other species possess the capability to perform polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism. However, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT stands out as it can utilize glutathione as a sulfur source, due to the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2)81. Within the P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT strain, we identified paeninodin (60%) and bacillopaline (100%), which were originally characterized in Paenibacillus dendritiformis C45482 and Paenibacillus mucilaginosus KNP41483, respectively. Furthermore, this strain harbors a siderophore gene cluster (100%) responsible for producing the antimycobacterial agent bacillibactin84. The siderophore cluster also facilitates the conversion of iron from Fe3+ to Fe2+, which is a more usable form for the microbe and its plant host under iron-limited conditions. Siderophore synthesis gene clusters are rare in Paenibacillus species and are believed to have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer events85. Genome mining resulted in identifying key functional genes of the novel species described in this study are listed in Table 7. Among all the novel species, mining of A. burdickii genome shows metal-dependent hydrolases of the β-lactamase superfamily III (MBL-III) enzyme. The MBL-III enzymes have shown potential in bioremediation processes aimed at the degradation of environmental pollutants86. The ability of MBL-III enzymes to degrade diverse chemical compounds, including pesticides, herbicides, and aromatic compounds, makes them valuable tools in the cleanup of contaminated environments87. These MBL-III enzymes can contribute to the removal and detoxification of pollutants, reducing their impact on ecosystems. Similarly, only in the genome of A. burdickii, DNA-binding heavy metal response regulator is predicted as shown in Arthrobacter sp. H-02-388 which plays a crucial role in cellular responses to heavy metal exposure, including detoxification, metal homeostasis, stress response, and environmental adaptation. In the genome of L. virtsii, organomercurial lyase is predicted which is reported to play a crucial role in the detoxification of organomercurial compounds, contributing to the protection of organisms and ecosystems by actinobacteria88. Its significance lies in the detoxification of toxic organomercurials, environmental protection, potential applications in bioremediation, insights into enzyme mechanisms, and biotechnological applications. Understanding and harnessing the capabilities of organomercurial lyase can aid in addressing mercury pollution and developing sustainable solutions for environmental and human health challenges88. The magnesium and cobalt efflux protein (CorC) plays a significant role in maintaining metal ion homeostasis, protecting against metal toxicity, facilitating adaptation to metal-rich environments, and contributing to bacterial stress response. Its activity is important for cellular functions and can also impact antibiotic resistance. The identification of CorC in only three Leifsonia genomes during this study, while not observed in other novel species, holds significant potential for enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms employed by actinobacterial group to regulate metal ions and adapt to diverse environmental conditions. In summary, the rare microbiome is instrumental in maintaining ecosystem stability, adapting to environmental changes, facilitating ecological interactions, spurring biotechnological innovation, and bolstering conservation efforts. Investigations into, and preservation of, the rare microbiome enhance our understanding of microbial diversity and ecosystem dynamics, thereby contributing to the sustainable management of the ecosystems. Conservation strategies should consider the preservation of rare microorganisms, as their loss could precipitate cascading effects on ecosystem functioning and resilience. Our study of novel microbes and predicted bioactive compounds contributes to our understanding of the microbial ecosystem on the ISS and lays the groundwork for further investigation into the potential implications of these novel species for the health and well-being of the ISS crew, as well as future space missions. The presence of specific genes and proteins in these novel species underscores their adaptive capabilities and potential resistance mechanisms against a variety of environmental challenges, including exposure to antibiotics. A deeper understanding of the genetic composition and functional capabilities of these novel species provides valuable insights into their survival strategies and could contribute to the development of improved antimicrobial therapies and strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.",

Copyright notice ID: 10628120 PMID: 37932283 Abstract With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values, when compared to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for all species described here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (= NRRL B-65660T = DSM 115933T), Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (= NRRL B-65661T = DSM 115931T), Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT (= NRRL B-65662T = DSM 115932T), Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (= NRRL B-65663T = DSM 115940T), and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (= NRRL B-65664T = DSM 115943T). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions. Subject terms: Environmental microbiology, Functional genomics, Genome, ProkaryoteIntroduction Multiple low-Earth orbit and lunar orbit space habitats are being planned by governmental and commercial entities as part of the newly revitalized space industry in the 2020s. Cleaning practices and microbial monitoring to ensure crew safety will likely be based on information garnered from studies of the International Space Station (ISS), which is the only space habitat currently in orbit with a long-term history of human habitation. Surfaces of the crew resupply vehicles1 and cargo destined to the ISS are cleaned to minimize microbial contamination and protect crew health. Nevertheless, the constant presence of human crew members (approximately six at any given time) on the ISS may lead to the shedding of microorganisms onto its surfaces, potentially causing recontamination and becoming dominant members of the habitat’s microbiome2. As a result, ISS surfaces are required to be routinely (once a week) cleaned to maintain a low biomass level (< 104 CFU/100 cm2 bacteria and < 100 CFU/100 cm2 fungi)3. Despite this rigorous cleaning and maintenance, it has been reported that some resilient microbes, albeit in low numbers, have adapted to microgravity conditions and persist4. Examples are the discovery of a novel bacterial genus found repeatedly in metagenomes, which has subsequently been isolated from ISS surfaces during further sampling campaigns5, and the isolation of the same clonal strains of Acinetobacter pittii from ISS surfaces during different years and sampling campaigns6. Characterizing the genomes and adaptation mechanisms of rare or novel species that manage to recolonize ISS surfaces is important because rare species are more likely to have narrow niche breadth, and so are persisting due to adaptive mechanisms to the stresses of radiation, desiccation, and microgravity conditions rather than via generalist strategies. Such microbes are therefore also fertile grounds for biotechnology applications research. Characterizing novel microbial species on the ISS is crucial for monitoring microbial contamination and protecting astronaut health. The process of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species found on the ISS helps to identify potential pathogens, as well as to understand potential impact on the spacecraft and its equipment (for example, in biofouling). Easily detecting or identifying a potential microbial threat, whether it be to human health or to the operation of the spacecraft or space station, depends on having an up-to-date, comprehensive database of microbial genomes, their species identity and their phenotypic characteristics (for example, are they known to carry or easily acquire antimicrobial resistance genes, are they UV resistant, what types of surfaces are they more likely to be found on, etc.). This is particularly the case when genetic information about a microbial threat is collected via shotgun metagenomic sequencing rather than by whole genome sequencing of pure culture; in that case, accurate identification relies entirely on an accurate database. The process of characterizing the previously unsequenced cultivable microbiome of space habitats continues to reduce the amount of microbial ‘dark matter’ found in metagenomic sequencing results. In the ongoing Microbial Tracking (MT) investigation of the ISS7,8, out of 510 genomes sequenced, 56 microbial species have been isolated multiple times, representing 27 microbial genera (19 bacteria and 8 fungi). Dominant microbial species include bacterial genera Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Acinetobacter, yeast genus Rhodotorula, and fungal genera Penicillium, Aureobasidium, and Aspergillus9–25. In this communication, six strains isolated from various ISS environmental surfaces belonging to five novel bacterial species constituting four different genera (Arthrobacter, Leifsonia, Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina) are described. Since recent bacterial taxonomy heavily depends on genomic characterization, WGS of these novel species were generated and compared with publicly available genomes of closely related species. One of the objectives of this study was to establish these six strains as novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, physiological, and phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes) analyses were carried out. To discover the phylogenetic placement within their respective genera, we have employed multiple gene analyses and WGS-based phylogenies containing all shared single-copy core genes. The second objective was to quantify the abundance of these recently identified species in the metagenomes of ISS surfaces. Hence, an in-depth analysis was conducted on the metagenomes collected during seven different flight missions, consisting of 106 individual samples, to assess the presence and prevalence of the species. In addition, an attempt was made to generate metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) of these novel species from the ISS metagenomes. Finally, antiSMASH analysis was performed to identify, annotate, and analyze secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) in the genomes of these novel bacterial species. Specialized metabolites and natural products encoded by these novel bacterial BGCs might provide insight into how different bacterial species thrive and interact in ISS conditions.Materials and methods Sample collection and isolation During the MT-1 and MT-2 mission series, samples were collected from the same set of eight surfaces aboard the ISS using pre-packaged and pre-sterilized wipes7,8. Upon return to Earth, among other strains belonging to previously defined species, six strains were isolated from both the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) platform and crew quarters when grown on blood agar (37 °C for 24 h) or R2A (25 °C for 7 days) media which were unable to be assigned to a known species and were suspected to be novel. Preliminary 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strains isolated during Flight 3 (n = 1) from the ARED platform (IIF3SC-B10T) and Flight 6 (n = 5) from both the ARED platform (F6_3S_P_1B and F6_3S_P_1CT) and crew quarters (F6_8S_P_1AT, F6_8S_P_1BT and F6_8S_P_1C) belonged to four different genera: Arthrobacter, Leifsonia, Paenibacillus, and Sporosarcina. However, further WGS analysis is required to identify the strains at the species level.Light microscopy and SEM A liquid culture of spore-forming strains was heat shocked (80 °C for 10 min), then plated on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) and grown at 30 °C for 5 days to induce endospore formation. Endospore staining with malachite green and safranin was performed using the Schaeffer-Fulton method26. Light microscopy and phase contrast images were taken on an Olympus BX53 microscope with an Olympus DP25 camera using Olympus cellSens software. All strains were grown out on TSA media at 24 °C for 72 h. An isolated colony was fixed in a 4 °C solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, United States) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (NaCaco) (Sigma Aldrich) for an hour. The suspended cells were collected using a vacuum pump and a 0.2 µm Isopore filter membrane (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, United States), and then transferred into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. The sample was incubated in 0.1 M NaCaco solution at 4 °C for 10 min and then replaced with fresh 0.1 M NaCaco solution; this washing step was repeated a total of 3 times. The sample then went through dehydration by a step series of increasing IPA and water solutions at 10 min intervals. The series was: 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 100%, with the final 100% rinsing occurring 3 times. The sample was stored at 4 °C in 100% IPA until it was then critically point dried in a Tousimis Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Rockville, MD, United States). Samples were affixed with carbon tape to SEM stubs (Ted Pella Inc.) and then were coated in a ~ 12 nm thick carbon layer by a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Deerfield, IL, United States). SEM images were collected on a FEI Quanta 200F microscope (Themo Fisher, Waltham, MA, United States) located at the California Institute of Technologies Kavli Nanoscience Institute.Biochemical tests and phenotype characterization Growth temperature and other phenotypic parameters of the tested strains were assessed as follows. Bacterial strains were inoculated in both solid (R2A plates) and liquid (trypticase soy broth (TSB), BD Diagnostics Cat # 257107) media in 15 ml loose-capped centrifuge tubes and grown at temperatures of 4, 15, 25, 30, 37, and 45 °C. Growth on plates and in tubes was monitored daily for 7 days, and incubation was halted if growth was observed. Samples grown at 4 °C and 15 °C were incubated for an additional 4 weeks and 2 weeks, respectively, for final growth assessment. Salt tolerance was determined by inoculating the strains onto R2A plates containing 0–5% added NaCl, as well as agar containing only peptone plus 0 or 1% NaCl and examining growth after 7 days of incubation at 30 °C. Oxidase activity was determined by using OxiDrops™ Liquid Oxidase Reagent (Hardy Diagnostics) on solid culture. Catalase activity was determined by observing effervescence when bacterial colonies were mixed with hydrogen peroxide on a sterile glass slide. Finally, pH tolerance (4 to 10) was tested by adjusting the pH of TSB broth with biological buffers, as described in Xu et al.27. Biochemical tests were performed for each strain using a Gram-positive identification card (Vitek 2 GP ID, bioMérieux) according to manufacturers’ protocol. Briefly, freshly grown colonies were transferred aseptically into a saline (aqueous 0.45% to 0.50% NaCl, pH 4.5 to 7.0) tube to prepare homogenous suspension with a density equivalent to a McFarland No. 0.50 to 0.63 using a calibrated VITEK® 2 DensiCHEK™ Plus. The suspension tube and Vitek 2 GP ID card were placed in the cassette and incubated at 37 °C. Data entry, cassette loading to instrument and retrieval of raw data were done according to the VITEK instrument user manual. Test results were recorded within 10 h of incubation. Phenotypic fingerprints were generated through GNIII MicroPlate according to BioLog's protocol. Briefly, freshly grown colonies were transferred aseptically into the inoculum solution A (Cat #. 72401; BioLog) to prepare homogenous suspension with a density equivalent to a McFarland No. 0.50. Inoculum was loaded onto BioLog GNIII MicroPlate (100 µl per well) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. OmniLog values (A590-A750) were recorded after a minimum 10 h of incubation using MicroPlate reader (FLUO star Omega, BMG Labtech, Germany).Chemotaxonomy To analyze the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), cells were grown on TSA at 30 °C for 48 h until they reached mid-exponential growth phase. The harvested cell biomass was subjected to saponification, methylation, and extraction28 for fatty acid analysis, which was carried out using the Microbial Identification System (MIDI)29 with the Aerobe (RTSBA6) database (Sherlock version 6.0) following the standard protocol30. A gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) with a flame ionization detector was used for FAME analysis, and identification and comparison of the results were made using the MIDI System. To extract and analyze quinones, polar lipids and peptidoglycans, cells were cultivated on TSA for 3 days at 30 °C. The polar lipids and quinones were extracted and analyzed by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (2D-TLC)31. To visualize the different classes of polar lipids, the developed TLC plates were treated with 10% (w/v) ethanolic phosphomolybdic acid for total lipids, 0.2% (w/v) ninhydrin in butanol for aminolipids (specific for amino groups), Dittmer and Lester’s Zinzadze reagent for phospholipids (specific for phosphates), and α-naphthol for glycolipids (specific for sugars). Peptidoglycans were extracted and analyzed for the diagnostic amino acids from whole cells32.DNA extraction and whole genome sequencing To extract genomic DNA from the novel species, the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit was utilized, following the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare the library for WGS, an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit was used as described earlier10. Sequencing of prepared libraries was carried out on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform. The read qualities were evaluated using FastQC v.0.11.733, and subsequenly quality filtered, trimmed and cleared of adapter sequences using fastp v0.2034. Draft genomes were assembled using SPAdes v.3.11.135 up to the scaffold level, and the assembly quality was evaluated using QUAST v.5.0.236. The default settings were employed for all steps except for fastp, which included 512 adapters screening. In addition to Illumina WGS, a secondary round of sequencing was carried out for strains IIF3SC-B10T and F6_8S_P_1BT using Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Additionally, Sporosarcina thermotolerans CCUG 53480 T, kindly provided by Dr. Edward Moore from the Culture Collection University of Gothenburg (CCUG), Sweden, also underwent WGS with the use of Nanopore MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Nanopore sequencing libraries were prepared using the SQK-RBK114.24 rapid chemistry-based barcoding kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Long read sequencing was conducted using an R.10.4.1 flow cell. Base calling was performed via MinKnow/Guppy. Adapters were trimmed using Porechop (v.0.2.4)37 and reads were filtered using filtlong v.0.2.1, with parameters –min_length 1000 –keep_percent 90. For strains IIF3SC-B10T and F6_8S_P_1BT, a hybrid genome assembly was generated using Unicycler (v.0.5.0)38. For strain CCUG 53480T a long-read only assembly was generated using the same tool with default settings. Genome assembly quality was assessed using QUAST (v.5.2.0)36.ANI and dDDH analyses To elucidate species affiliation of the isolated genomes, we retrieved all validly described and representative genomes of four identified genera from the  database using the command-line tool ‘bit’39. We calculated the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to perform pairwise nucleotide-level comparisons. For ANI calculations, we employed FastANI v.1.33, which is a rapid alignment-free computational method, with the novel species as a query against other genomes. To estimate the in-silico DNA–DNA hybridization, we used the recommended formula 2 of the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC) v.3.0 with the BLAST + alignment tool40. To further evaluate the genetic relatedness of the genomes of the genera Sporosarcina, ANI based analysis was used. All available genomes on the  GenBank database under the genera Sporosarcina (n = 93) were retrieved using ncbi-genome-download (v.0.3.1). An all-vs-all ANI analysis of the genomes was conducted and drawn using ANIclustermap (v.1.2.0).Phylogenetic analysis The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the novel species were extracted from their WGS. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for each genus by incorporating publicly available 16S sequences of all the species within the respective genus. In cases where only the WGS was publicly available, a blast wrapper script was employed to extract the 16S sequence. The trees were rooted using a related species within the same family. The DECIPHER package was used to align and trim the 16S sequences41. To build phylogenetic trees, the phangorn package was used42 on maximum likelihood with AIC values and 1,000 bootstrap replicates42. The trees were visualized using Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL)43. We created a whole genome-based phylogenies to identify closely related species of the isolated genomes. We used GToTree v.1.7.0744, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based command-line tool which aligns identified single copy genes using Muscle v.3.8 and produces concatenated protein alignment. For the Arthrobacter and Leifsonia genomes, we used 138 single-copy gene (SCG) sets of Actinobacteria, while for the Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes, we used 119 SCG sets of Firmicutes. IQTREE v.2.2.0.3 with ModelFinder-Plus was then used to construct the phylogenetic tree from the protein alignment with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates45–47. We further retrieved 4,552 complete, non-anomalous, representative genomes of bacteria from  Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database and constructed a phylogenetic tree of life along with the novel species using 16 SCG-set as previously described48 (data not shown). Genomes containing at least 40% of the total 16 SGC targets were placed in the phylogenetic tree. All the trees were further annotated and visualized using interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) v.6.749.Mapping metagenome sequence reads from ISS to isolated novel species To investigate the presence of the isolated novel species in environmental samples from ISS, we retrieved paired-end metagenomics reads from two microbial tracking (MT) missions, MT-1 (n = 42) and MT-2 (n = 64), from the  Short Read Archive with project accession PRJNA4385454 and PRJNA7812778, respectively. Quality filtering of the metagenomes was performed using Trimmomatic v.0.39 with a sliding window of 4 bases and an average quality per base cutoff of 2050. We used MetaCompass v.2.051 to perform reference-guided assembly of the aligned metagenome reads against isolated genomes of novel species. We quantified the number of reads that aligned to the isolated genomes and assessed the breadth of the coverage of the assembled reads in each sample. We further tried to bin the contigs using MetaBAT v.2.12.1, but were unable to resolve any MAGs.Genome annotation and prediction of secondary-metabolite biosynthetic potential The gene prediction and annotation of the novel genomes were performed using the Rapid Annotations based on Subsystem Technology (RAST) online server using RAST-tk annotation scheme52. The Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) v6.0.1 web portal which utilizes the CARD v3.2.6 database was used to identify antibiotic resistance genes and markers in the novel species from ISS environments with only “Perfect” and “Strict” matches. Secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were identified within each novel genomes using antiSMASH v.7.0.0 with a “strict” detection system53. The identified BGCs were curated for functional annotation using MIBiG v.3.1 JSON file via an in-house Python script54.Results The six strains isolated during this study belonged to five novel species spanning four bacterial genera. Among the six strains, four were non-spore-forming members and two strains formed endospores. Based on 16S rRNA gene similarities, not all strains were identified into a novel bacterial species, but ANI/dDDH analyses allowed them to be placed into five distinct bacterial species. They were: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT, Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT, Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T. In addition, the WGS of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was generated and compared with the genome of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T to identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits. Genome characteristics and relatedness indices Table 1 summarizes the assembly statistics for all six strains. The draft genomes of the novel bacterial species were assembled using high-quality sequences, and their assembly quality varied from a single contig to 49 scaffolds. The non-spore-forming strains had high GC contents, ranging from 68% to 71.4%, whereas spore-forming strains, such as P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (46.1%) and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (41.6%), had low GC content. The total number of predicted genes was 2166 for S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T and 4861 for P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. However, the non-spore-forming bacterial species had ~ 3444 to 3850 coding regions (Table 1). In addition to the novel species, the complete genome of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was generated and compared to S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T strain since both shared > 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities.

The 16S rRNA gene sequences of all five novel species described in this study exhibited > 99% similarities to previously established species. However, the gyrB gene sequence similarities of the novel species with the closely related species ranged from 88.6 to 92.8% and could serve as a genetic marker to distinguish the novel species. Moreover, ANI indices (< 95%) and dDDH values (< 70%) fell below the threshold levels of bacterial species identity and confirmed that the examined ISS strains were novel species. Table 2.

This suggests that the 16S rRNA gene may not be an adequate marker for distinguishing members within this genus. However, upon analyzing the gyrB gene sequences of this phylogenetic clade, the similarity values were found to be below 85.9%. Furthermore, strain IIF3SC-B10T displayed low values for digital dDDH (24.5%) and ANI indices (82.9%). These findings provide additional evidence supporting its classification as a novel species. In the 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree encompassing all Arthrobacter species (Fig. 1A), with Micrococcus antarcticus as the outgroup, strain IIF3SC-B10T clustered together with officially named species such as A. agilis, A. cheniae, A. bussei, and A. antioxidans (Fig. 1A). However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 1B), constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 59 genomes containing 138 single-copy core genes common to all Actinobacteria, A. burdickii was found to be distinct from the A. ruber and A. cheniae clades. Instead, it exhibited closer similarity to the unrecognized species A. sedimenti (ANI 93.8%). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Arthrobacter species including strain IIF3SC-B10T based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 138 single-copy core genes of phylum Actinobacteria, keeping Kocuria rhizophila as an outgroup.The 16S rRNA gene sequences of L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT, isolated from crew quarters in Flight 6, exhibited > 98.9% similarity to L. soli and L. shinshuensis, indicating that the 16S rRNA gene is not a suitable marker for distinguishing members of this genus. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences of the members of this phylogenetic clade, the similarity values were below 91.7%. However, the strain F6_8S_P_1AT exhibited low dDDH values (< 28.3%) and ANI indices (86.3%), providing further evidence that it belongs to a novel species. In the 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree of all Leifsonia species, with Rathayibacter tritici as the outgroup, strain F6_8S_P_1AT was placed within a clade that also included the validly described species L. aquatica, L. xyli, L. lichenia, L. shinshuensis, and L. soli (Fig. 2A). However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 2B), which was constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters of eight available genomes containing a total of 138 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Actinobacteria, L. virtsii was separated from all these Leifsonia species. The next closest member was L. soli (ANI 86.3%). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Leifsonia species including strains F6_8S_P_1AT, F6_8S_P_1BT and F6_8S_P_1C based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 138 single-copy core genes of phylum Actinobacteria, keeping Nocardia fluminea as an outgroup.In addition to L. virtsii, two strains were identified as L. williamsii based on their gyrB sequence similarity (91.6%), ANI index (84.3%), and dDDH value (24.7%), which were below the species threshold level. Surprisingly, despite the high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between L. virtsii and L. williamsii (99.2%), the 16S rRNA gene tree (Fig. 2A) placed them in different clades, supported by 88% bootstrap values. Notably, the L. williamsii strains were isolated from the same crew quarter location as L. virtsii, and they even originated from the same culture plate of R2A medium. Initially, there was a suspicion that they might be clones from the same colony, but further analysis using WGS and gyrB sequencing confirmed that they were distinct novel species. In contrast to the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, the WGS-based tree (Fig. 2B) clearly differentiated L. williamsii from L. virtsii. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, isolated from the ARED’s surface during Flight 6, exhibited 99.5% similarity to P. pabuli, indicating that the 16S rRNA gene is not a suitable marker for distinguishing members of this genus. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences, P. pabuli also exhibited 94.9% similarity with P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. Since it was established that ~ 95% gyrB as cut-off value for species delineation, WGS was performed which showed that ANI index was only 88.4%. Based on low ANI index and dDDH value (34.6%), P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT is differentiated from P. pabuli and described as a novel species. The 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny (Fig. 3A) showed that P. xylanivrans, P. taichungensis, and P. paubli formed a tight clade with > 99% similarities among them. However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 3B), which was constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 244 genomes containing a total of 119 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Firmicutes, P. vandeheii was separated from all these Paenibacillus species and was found to be closer to the P. xylanivorans (ANI 92.8%). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Paenibacillus species including strain F6_3S_P_1CT based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 119 single-copy core genes of phylum Firmicutes, keeping Bacillus subtilis as an outgroup.The strain F6_3S_P_2T, another spore-forming bacterium belonging to the genus Sporosarcina and isolated from the ARED surface during Flight 6, displayed a 99.8% similarity to S. thermotolerans based on the 16S rRNA gene. This finding highlights the difficulty in classifying spore-forming microorganisms using the 16S rRNA gene marker. Hence, the WGS of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was needed to identify the phylogenetic position of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences, S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T exhibited an 87.0% similarity with S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T. Furthermore, the ANI index between the genomes of F6_3S_P_2T and S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was only 85.3%. Considering the low ANI index and dDDH value (29.8%), S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T can be identified as a novel species, distinct from S. thermotolerans. In the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny (Fig. 4A), S. thermotolerans, S. luteola, and S. saromensis formed a closely related clade with > 99% similarities among them. However, S. koreensis did not cluster within this clade, despite having a 16S rRNA gene similarity with S. highlanderae. On the other hand, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 4B), constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 15 genomes containing 119 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Firmicutes, S. highlanderae was separated from all other Sporosarcina species. Instead, it exhibited closer similarity to S. thermotolerans (ANI 85.3%). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Sporosarcina species including strain F6_3S_P_2T and Sporosarcina thermotolerans CCUG 53480T based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 119 single-copy core genes of phylum Firmicutes, keeping Paenibacillus polymyxa as an outgroup.Phenotypic characterization The cell size (Fig. 5), colony morphology, biochemical characteristics based on Vitek-2 (Supplemental Table S1) and BioLog GNIII (Supplemental Table S2), fatty acid profiles (Supplemental Table S3) and chemotaxonomic features (Supplemental Figure S1) of all five novel species are presented. A. burdickii can be phenotypically differentiated from other closely related Arthrobacter species since maltose, trehalose, cellobiose, turanose, and acetoacetic acid were not utilized as sole carbon substrate (Table 3). The Leifsonia species did not show any specific phenotypic characteristics that could be used to differentiate them from other closely related Leifsonia species; hence, molecular phylogeny is essential (Table 4). P. vandeheii was able to grow at 8% NaCl which can be used as discriminative test. Oxidase test was also positive whereas P. tundrae, P. xylanexedens, and P. amylolitus were negative. In addition, P. vandeheii can be differentiated by the utilization of Tween 40, turanose, γ-hydroxybutyric acid, l-malic acid, and l-serine as sole carbon source from P. taichungensis and P. paubli which are negative (Table 5). S. highlanderae could grow at 4% NaCl only, but S. thermotolerans, S. luteola, and S. saromensis were able to withstand > 7.5% to 10% NaCl concentration (Table 6). Figure 5.

Additionally, A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T was found to possess a significant amount of an unidentified phospholipid (PL1), a characteristic that sets it apart from Leifsonia species. P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited a complex polar lipid profile, which included phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, two unidentified phospholipids and an unidentified aminophospholipid. On the other hand, S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T was found to contain phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine two unidentified phospholipids and an identified lipid. The polar lipid profiles of new species are in excellent agreement with the data published earlier for Arthrobacter55, Leifsonia56, Paenibacillus57,58, and Sporosarcina59. Based on this polyphasic taxonomy, the five novel species are described, and their detailed phenotypic, FAME profile, chemotaxonomic, and molecular characteristics are given below.

To assess the presence of viable and intact cells of the novel species, we utilized propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment on the samples as previously described7,8. Our findings revealed that the majority of the metagenomes had less than 0.1% of their total reads mapped to the novel species. Among all the species analyzed, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited the highest mapping, with a maximum of 1.05% of total reads from a sample collected during Flight 2 near the port crew quarters (location 8) during MT-1. Therefore, we can conclude that none of these novel species are dominant in the ISS. Considering the limited proportion of reads mapped to the novel species, we proceeded to perform read assembly to explore the breadth of coverage against the isolated genomes. Interestingly, reads mapped to L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT and L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT from Flight 6 at location 8 exhibited a breadth of coverage of 59.4% and 80.7% respectively, despite representing a small fraction of the total reads (Fig. 6). However, apart from these cases, the overall breadth of coverage for the genomes was quite low, averaging at 0.21% hence, no MAG was generated. We also analyzed the PMA untreated samples and observed the similar pattern in the distribution of the breadth of coverages. Additionally, we noticed 84.4% breadth of coverage for L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT during Flight 7 at location 8 from where the strain was isolated. Despite the presence of a high breadth of coverage for Leifsonia genomes across multiple samples, we were unable to obtain MAGs due to the failure of achieving the minimum coverage depth threshold of 4X. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Box plots showing breadth of coverage of the consensus genome constructed from mapped reads aligned to the novel species (percent coverage was less than 1% in all cases). Due to high variations in the breadth of coverages of Leifsonia genomes, a broken Y-axis was used. The reads were collected from eight locations on the ISS across seven separate time points/flights as part of the Microbial Tracking project(s).Functional characterization of the novel species To investigate the genetic characteristics of the six novel strains, we performed a comprehensive genome annotation using RAST-tk (Table 7; Supplemental Table S4). The subsystem mapping results are as follows: A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (283 subsystems), L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (273 subsystems), L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT (262 subsystems), L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1CT (262 subsystems), P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (324 subsystems), and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (307 subsystems). Among the annotated subsystems, the top categories based on average gene counts included amino acids and derivatives (260 genes), carbohydrate metabolism (232 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (136 genes), and protein metabolism (171 genes).

Two mechanisms were predicted as the primarily function of these genes: resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and invasion and intracellular resistance. A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, in particular, is the only species that harbors the sarcosine oxidase (EC 1.5.3.1) gene, which is involved in the osmotic stress response. On the other hand, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T, both belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, possess a specific mechanism to respond to bacitracin-induced stress through the bceABRS four-component system. Notably, these two species also possess additional stress response mechanisms for periplasmic stress via the intramembrane protease RasP/YluC. While exploring other factors, it was observed that A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T does not possess any genes associated with motility. However, the other novel species have genes related to motility, including flagellar biosynthesis proteins. Among all the species, only P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT has the chemotaxis subsystem. We conducted further investigations into the metabolic potential of these novel species and made some noteworthy observations. A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T was found to possess a significantly higher number of genes related to aromatic compound metabolism, while having fewer genes associated with iron metabolism compared to the other species characterized in this study. With the exception of P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, all the other species exhibited the capability to perform polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism. However, only P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, due to the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2), can utilize glutathione as a sulfur source. Considering the concerns regarding spore-forming bacteria and their resistance to sterilization processes in the ISS, we further explored the spore-forming capabilities of these novel species. As expected, a significant number of genes associated with dormancy and sporulation were predicted in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T genomes. Between them, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited the highest number of 40 genes, primarily associated with spore germination and spore maturation processes. In contrast, the other species are non-spore forming and do not possess specific proteins associated with sporulation.Antimicrobial resistance properties of the novel species In the isolated five novel species, we searched for antibiotic resistance genes against the CARD database60 and calculated the percentage identity with the reference sequences. Overall, these genomes showed potential resistance to seven drug classes, including rifamycin and tetracycline antibiotics. Interestingly, we found that all of these genomes contained genes from vancomycin resistance gene clusters with an identity ranging from 30.7% to 51.5%. Among other identified resistance genes, we discovered the presence of rifampicin monooxygenase (RIFMO) in Leifsonia species with a 63% match, which catalyzes the inactivation of the antibiotic rifampicin. In P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, we identified a set of markers, including Llm 23S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase (LlmA_23S_CLI) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), which exhibited high sequence identities of 84.67% and 87.91%, respectively. LlmA_23S_CLI was originally detected in Paenibacillus sp. LC231, a strain isolated from Lechuguilla Cave, NM, USA61. Additionally, strain F6_3S_P_1CT was found to possess two genes, qacG and qacJ, which are part of a small multidrug resistance efflux pump conferring resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). Furthermore, in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T, we identified the presence of tetracycline-resistant ribosomal protection genes tetB(P) and tet(Q), respectively, with approximately 30% similarity. These provide resistance by preventing the binding of the antibiotic tetracycline to the bacterial ribosome. Moreover, these genomes also encode orthologues of the antibiotic-inactivating enzyme fosfomycin thiol transferase. The genomic mining predicted the presence of AMR genes but the confirmation of the phenotypic resistance requires further investigation.Production of secondary metabolites To explore the potential for producing secondary metabolites in the newly discovered species, we utilized antiSMASH, a bioinformatics tool for predicting putative BGCs. This analysis revealed a total of 16 cluster types, including βlactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters (Table 8). In A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, we identified a moderately matched thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161, known for its effectiveness against multidrug-resistant Gram-stain-positive bacteria and fungi62. Furthermore, in the isolated Leifsonia species, we found two well-known gene clusters: T3PKS-alkylresorcinol and NAPAA (non-α poly-amino acids) ε-Poly-l-lysine (ε-PL), both with a 100% match. Among the analyzed species, Leifsonia species shared a partially matched carotenoid BGC with P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. However, several unique cluster types, including cyclic-lactone-autoinducer, lanthipeptide, lassopeptide, NRP-metallophore, opine-like-metallophore, and proteusin, were identified exclusively in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. Notably, within the F6_3S_P_1CT strain, we also identified BGCs paeninodin (60%) and bacillopaline (100%). Lastly, S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T exhibited one phosphonate, one T3PKS, and one terpene BGC, although these clusters have not yet been fully characterized. Table 8.

Missions to the moon are already underway, and missions to Mars are planned for the near future. Such missions will be measured in multiple years rather than in months and will have no or little resupply from Earth. In such cases, the microbiome of the space vessel or habitat will need to be monitored for multiple reasons: the spread of pathogens through the air or on surfaces which could infect humans63 or plants64 as well as the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes65, the health of human commensal microbiomes (and potential overgrowth of secondary pathogens), and the potential for biofouling of fluid lines or water supplies via microbial overgrowth66. Also, with no resupply from Earth there is no ability to gain access to Earth’s massive microbial biodiversity. Unless specific microbes are stocked as supplies before launch1, the microbes found on the spacecraft or habitat are the only ones which could be used for the many commercial purposes that microbes are used for on Earth: antibiotic or therapeutic discovery, manufacturing of drugs, food, and vitamins, plant growth enhancement, probiotics, etc. Biological in-situ resource utilization may also require bioremediation or bioconversion of raw, potentially toxic materials collected from moons, other planets, or asteroids/comets. Whether or not the microbiome of a space habitat can be controlled and repurposed to this extent depends on a number of factors, including (1) whether the microbial diversity of such a space habitat would be sufficient to include all the traits desired for the many purposes listed above, (2) accurate detection and identification of already-known microbes and taxonomic placement of unidentified microbes, including whether shotgun metagenomic sequencing would detect the presence of problematic microbes from low biomass surfaces, and (3) characterization of potential phenotypic traits based on genomic predictions. Like the proverbial mustard seed, perhaps we inadvertently carry a planet’s worth of microbial diversity wherever we travel. The novel microbes described herein are not necessarily any more noteworthy than those which might be isolated from an office building on Earth [though they are likely far more resilient given the harsh conditions67 of the space environment], and yet each hosts significant potential for affecting human health5 or for use in assisting plant growth68, bioremediation or manufacturing, and offers a glimpse into the genetic and metabolic potential of the microbial diversity of the ISS69. The most abundant cultivable microbes on ISS surfaces include common, well-studied human commensals such as Staphylococcus, Rhodotorula, Penicillium, and Micrococcus species. However, there are many more that have only been isolated once aboard the ISS and which are at very low abundance—potentially shed from individual astronauts, from experiments such as plant grow-ins, from new pieces of cargo, or from the vast microbial diversity of the human gut—which can be considered a part of the rare microbiome. Although individually rare, members of this community collectively play significant roles in ecosystem functioning and stability, including functional redundancy which enhances the resilience and stability of ecosystems by ensuring that multiple microbial species can perform essential ecological functions, such as nutrient cycling, decomposition, and symbiotic interactions. The novel bacterial species described during this study belong to rare microbial species since their incidence in the shotgun metagenomes was very low, and only the two Leifsonia species had sufficiently high breadth of coverage of mapped metagenomic reads from the ISS crew quarters to have been definitively identified using shotgun metagenomic sequencing without culturing as well. Previous to using a WGS approach, the diversity of the ISS cultivable microbiome was significantly underestimated due to reliance on only 16S-based taxonomic identification. However, for many bacterial genera, 16S rRNA gene sequencing strategy fails to differentiate new species with significantly different phenotypic traits. For instance, there is 99.8% similarity between the 16S rRNA genes of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T and S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T, with a mere 3 base pair substitutions. Without access to the whole genome, S. highlanderae would be categorized as S. thermotolerans, even though it is not a thermophile. Upon accessing all 93 Sporosarcina genomes from the  database and generating an ANI heatmap (Supplemental Figure S2), it was evident that this clade contains at least five novel genera and 56 species which are yet to be described. This inference was based on ANI values of less than 70% for 14 Sporosarcina genomes, encompassing S. highlanderae, S. thermotolerans, and S. luteola and further emphasizes that the 16S rRNA gene on its own is not a reliable tool for differentiating among members of the Sporosarcina genus. Placing these 93 genomes into their phylogenetic affiliation require more study. Upon examining 337 ISS bacterial genomes (plus six novel strains) belonging to 36 bacterial species (plus five novel species), it was observed that non-dominant, rare, and phylogenetically undescribed species predicted to produce natural products. As their genetic and phenotypic potential remains uncharacterized, exploration of the rare microbiome can lead to the discovery of novel bioactive compounds, enzymes, and metabolic pathways. Many of these rare microorganisms have untapped biotechnological potential, with applications in fields such as medicine, agriculture, industry, and environmental remediation. Studying the rare microbiome can uncover valuable resources for the development of new biotechnological tools and processes. In the case of A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, we identified a moderately matched thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161, known for its efficacy against multidrug-resistant Gram-stain-positive bacteria and fungi62. Leifsonia species contain alkylresorcinol, which exhibits various activities including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and genotoxicity effects70. Additionally, alkylresorcinol plays a role in bacterial cyst formation during unfavorable environmental conditions71. On the other hand, ε-PL is responsible for antimicrobial activity against food spoilage and food-poisoning bacteria72. In addition, A. burdickii and P. vandeheii also harbor metal-dependent β-lactamase superfamily-I and III proteins, which are known for their involvement in the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics73. This enzyme family plays a significant role in conferring resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins. Furthermore, multidrug resistance efflux pumps such as the acriflavine resistance protein and Multidrug And Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) family of Multidrug Resistance (MDR) efflux pumps were found to be present in Leifsonia species and spore-formers. These efflux pumps contribute to bacterial resistance by actively pumping out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds from the cell, including antibiotics and toxic compounds, thereby reducing their intracellular concentrations and promoting bacterial survival. The acriflavin resistance protein (AcrA) is a crucial component of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, which confers resistance to acriflavin and other antimicrobial compounds. Its role in antibiotic resistance, multidrug efflux, intracellular homeostasis, biofilm formation, and potentially bacterial virulence underscores its significance in bacterial survival and adaptation. Understanding AcrA's function may aid in the development of strategies to combat antibiotic resistance and improve therapeutic approaches against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Given its involvement in antibiotic resistance and multidrug efflux, AcrA has emerged as a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents74. By inhibiting the function of AcrA or other components of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, it may be possible to overcome bacterial resistance and enhance the effectiveness of existing antibiotics. Identification of fosfomycin resistance protein (fosB) in both Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes in this study is crucial for effective infection control measures and the development of strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance. It has been reported that fosB is significant due to its impact on the treatment of bacterial infections, the emergence of multidrug resistance, the potential for horizontal gene transfer, and its implications for public health75. Streptothricin acetyltransferase was present in both Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes and it was reported that streptothricin is a valuable antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against microorganisms and can help reduce crop losses and increase agricultural productivity76. Its significance extends beyond its direct antimicrobial properties, finding applications in research, agriculture, and drug development. Understanding streptothricin's mode of action and resistance mechanisms contributes to our knowledge of antibiotics and aids in the development of novel strategies to combat bacterial infections. Streptothricin has shown efficacy in agricultural practices, particularly in plant and fungal disease management76. The ribosome protection-type tetracycline resistance-related proteins, group 2, are crucial determinants of resistance to tetracycline antibiotics in both Gram-stain-negative and positive microbes77. Their ability to protect ribosomes from the inhibitory effects of tetracycline enables microbial survival and growth in the presence of the antibiotic. The presence of these proteins in spore-forming novel species during this study and not in non-spore-forming bacteria needs further research. Choloylglycine hydrolase plays a critical role in bile acid metabolism, enterohepatic circulation, and the regulation of the bile acid pool78 and predicted only in the S. highlanderae genome. Its activity influences the composition and function of the gut microbiota and has implications for host health and disease79. Understanding the significance of this enzyme provides insights into bile acid metabolism disorders80 and potential therapeutic approaches for related conditions. Multiple genes for bioremediation of toxic material, enhanced plant growth, and survival in extreme conditions are predicted in the genomes of these novel species. Except for P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, all the other species possess the capability to perform polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism. However, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT stands out as it can utilize glutathione as a sulfur source, due to the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2)81. Within the P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT strain, we identified paeninodin (60%) and bacillopaline (100%), which were originally characterized in Paenibacillus dendritiformis C45482 and Paenibacillus mucilaginosus KNP41483, respectively. Furthermore, this strain harbors a siderophore gene cluster (100%) responsible for producing the antimycobacterial agent bacillibactin84. The siderophore cluster also facilitates the conversion of iron from Fe3+ to Fe2+, which is a more usable form for the microbe and its plant host under iron-limited conditions. Siderophore synthesis gene clusters are rare in Paenibacillus species and are believed to have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer events85. Genome mining resulted in identifying key functional genes of the novel species described in this study are listed in Table 7. Among all the novel species, mining of A. burdickii genome shows metal-dependent hydrolases of the β-lactamase superfamily III (MBL-III) enzyme. The MBL-III enzymes have shown potential in bioremediation processes aimed at the degradation of environmental pollutants86. The ability of MBL-III enzymes to degrade diverse chemical compounds, including pesticides, herbicides, and aromatic compounds, makes them valuable tools in the cleanup of contaminated environments87. These MBL-III enzymes can contribute to the removal and detoxification of pollutants, reducing their impact on ecosystems. Similarly, only in the genome of A. burdickii, DNA-binding heavy metal response regulator is predicted as shown in Arthrobacter sp. H-02-388 which plays a crucial role in cellular responses to heavy metal exposure, including detoxification, metal homeostasis, stress response, and environmental adaptation. In the genome of L. virtsii, organomercurial lyase is predicted which is reported to play a crucial role in the detoxification of organomercurial compounds, contributing to the protection of organisms and ecosystems by actinobacteria88. Its significance lies in the detoxification of toxic organomercurials, environmental protection, potential applications in bioremediation, insights into enzyme mechanisms, and biotechnological applications. Understanding and harnessing the capabilities of organomercurial lyase can aid in addressing mercury pollution and developing sustainable solutions for environmental and human health challenges88. The magnesium and cobalt efflux protein (CorC) plays a significant role in maintaining metal ion homeostasis, protecting against metal toxicity, facilitating adaptation to metal-rich environments, and contributing to bacterial stress response. Its activity is important for cellular functions and can also impact antibiotic resistance. The identification of CorC in only three Leifsonia genomes during this study, while not observed in other novel species, holds significant potential for enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms employed by actinobacterial group to regulate metal ions and adapt to diverse environmental conditions. In summary, the rare microbiome is instrumental in maintaining ecosystem stability, adapting to environmental changes, facilitating ecological interactions, spurring biotechnological innovation, and bolstering conservation efforts. Investigations into, and preservation of, the rare microbiome enhance our understanding of microbial diversity and ecosystem dynamics, thereby contributing to the sustainable management of the ecosystems. Conservation strategies should consider the preservation of rare microorganisms, as their loss could precipitate cascading effects on ecosystem functioning and resilience. Our study of novel microbes and predicted bioactive compounds contributes to our understanding of the microbial ecosystem on the ISS and lays the groundwork for further investigation into the potential implications of these novel species for the health and well-being of the ISS crew, as well as future space missions. The presence of specific genes and proteins in these novel species underscores their adaptive capabilities and potential resistance mechanisms against a variety of environmental challenges, including exposure to antibiotics. A deeper understanding of the genetic composition and functional capabilities of these novel species provides valuable insights into their survival strategies and could contribute to the development of improved antimicrobial therapies and strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.Supplementary Information Supplementary Information.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human achievement in space exploration. Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO2 levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is Enterobacter bugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections.Results Distinct from their Earth counterparts, ISS E. bugandensis strains have exhibited resistance mechanisms that categorise them within the ESKAPE pathogen group, a collection of pathogens recognised for their formidable resistance to antimicrobial treatments. During the 2-year Microbial Tracking 1 mission, 13 strains of multidrug-resistant E. bugandensis were isolated from various locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive study to understand the genomic intricacies of ISS-derived E. bugandensis in comparison to terrestrial strains, with a keen focus on those associated with clinical infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on Earth, could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, we meticulously mapped the prevalence and distribution of E. bugandensis across the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the persistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonisation of E. bugandensis in space. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting microbial communities alongside E. bugandensis in the ISS across multiple missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate microbial interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the ISS.Conclusions Our comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession of E. bugandensis within the ISS environment. The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, they shed light on microbial behaviour, adaptation, and evolution in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic threats.

    "introduction": "Introduction Microorganisms within built environments profoundly affect the health of inhabitants. The International Space Station (ISS), a highly controlled built environment harbouring extreme conditions such as microgravity, solar radiation, and elevated CO2 levels, offers a unique place for studying microbial survival and adaptation [1]. Recent studies have demonstrated that microorganisms exposed to microgravity can acquire antibiotic resistance and heightened virulence via rapid mutations and horizontal gene transfer [2–4]. Prolonged space travel under microgravity can also compromise astronauts’ immune systems, elevating their vulnerability to diseases [5]. The microbial population of the ISS might potentially impact astronauts’ microbiomes and get replenished by the arrival of new crew [6]. Thus, understanding microbial colonisation, succession, and interactions is pivotal for ensuring astronaut well-being and managing microbial risks in isolated and confined human habitats. Persistent efforts have been made to monitor the ISS microbiome through multiple microbial tracking missions [3, 7], identifying novel microorganisms [8–11], studying antibiotic resistance [12] to unveiling microbial interactions [13]. Enterobacter bugandensis, a newly recognised species, emerges as one of the important opportunistic pathogens within the Enterobacter genus and has been isolated predominantly from clinical specimens [14, 15]. Species from this Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic genus exist in various environments, from soil to the human gut [16]. In addition, some Enterobacter species act as opportunistic human pathogens, causing nosocomial infections with bacteremia, lower respiratory tract, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and urinary tract infection [17]. Moreover, with time, Enterobacter isolates have been shown to manifest multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, AmpC overexpression, and altered membrane permeability [18], and have been designated as a member of ESKAPE pathogen group, recognised for their antimicrobial resistance prowess. Interestingly, recent studies have reported the isolation of 13 multi-drug resistant E. bugandensis strains from the ISS during the Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) mission [1, 19]. Motivated by the presence of E. bugandensis on the ISS, our central aim was to compare ISS-derived E. bugandensis genomes with their terrestrial counterparts, with an emphasis on clinical isolates. We trace the evolutionary dynamics of pivotal genes, including those involved in putative functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, possibly driven by the unique stresses of space. Expanding our investigations, we further examined metagenomic reads to map the prevalence of E. bugandensis across diverse ISS locations, capturing its temporal dynamics. In addition, we explored the coexisting microbial communities of E. bugandensis in ISS across multiple flights and locations. Subsequently, the intricate microbial interactions of E. bugandensis within the ISS were unveiled using a combination of robust computational approaches. This comprehensive analysis (Fig. 1) not only sheds light on how these interactions influence microbial diversity and contribute to the potential succession of E. bugandensis within the unique ISS habitat but also aids in designing strategic preventive measures against infections caused by pathogens.

    "methods": "Methods Collection and classification of E. bugandensis genomes In this study, we utilised publicly available annotated genomes of E. bugandensis ( taxonomic ID 881260) from the  GenBank sequence database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/, accessed on July 17, 2023) using command line tools  Entrez Direct (EDirect) and bit [56]. We downloaded 211 genomes, including 12 genomes of ISS strains and one MAG generated from the metagenome during the Microbial Tracking-1 mission. To identify the source of these isolates, we manually explored the  BioSample database and classified them into four consistent categories—Human, Non-human/ Environmental, ISS, and Unknown isolates. To ensure taxonomic identification and relatedness of the genomes, we employed the FastANI v.1.33 tool to calculate pairwise ANI for each downloaded genome [57]. The reference strain used for ANI calculation was the E. bugandensis type-strain EB-247T ( assembly ID GCF_900324475.1, available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMEA104711314/), which was originally isolated from the neonatal blood of a patient in Tanzania [14]. Phylogeny and SNP identification We used the Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based command-line tool, GToTree v.1.6.31 [58], to construct the phylogenetic tree of the E. bugandensis genomes. The tree was built at strain level using the single-copy gene (SCG)-set HMM of Gammaproteobacteria targeting 172 marker genes. We subsequently employed interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) v.6.7 [59] for visualisation and annotation of the tree. We excluded strain e1342 ( assembly ID GCF_900075565.1) from our further analyses, as it appeared as an outlier in the phylogenetic tree. For the ISS strains and its close Earth-bound isolates (as shown in Fig. 2, we computed the SNPs through a core-SNP set using Snippy v.4.6.0 (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) by mapping assembled contigs to annotated type-strain. Snippy uses Burrows-Wheelers Aligner and SAMtools v.1.3.1 for alignment and FreeBayes to identify variants across the provided genomes. We further ran Gubbins v.3.2.1 for recombination-removal and FastTree v.2.1.11 with the generalised time-reversible (GTR) model for tree-building on the output from Snippy to produce the phylogenetic tree shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A. Identifying ISS-associated genomic features of E. bugandensis To identify and annotate the ORFs in the genomes of E. bugandensis, we utilised Prokka v.1.14.6, which employs Prodigal for gene prediction [60]. Prokka’s standard automated pipeline annotated the genomes based on multiple reference databases. We employed the Python package cogclassifier v.1.0.5 (https://pypi.org/project/cogclassifier/) to identify and classify COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Genes) from the Prokka annotated genomes. We applied the graph-based algorithm Panaroo v.1.3.2 in strict mode, employing specific parameters (including a sequence identity threshold of 0.7, a core genome sample threshold of 0.95, no paralog splitting, and the “Clustal” aligner) and constructed a pan-genome [61]. Subsequently, we used IQTREE v.2.2.27 on the Panaroo core alignment output, with the GTR+G model in fast mode, to build an alternative phylogenetic tree [62]. For gene-level genome-wide association analysis, we employed Scoary v.1.6.16, using the gene presence-absence matrix generated by Panaroo [63]. This analysis enabled us to identify associations between all genes in the accessory genome and the traits of interest. To identify the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and markers in the isolated genomes and MAGs of E. bugandensis from the ISS, we employed the Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) v.6.0.2, a command line tool using the CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) v.3.2.6 [22]. Matches were restricted to “Perfect” and “Strict” matches only, ensuring high confidence in the identified antibiotic resistance genes and markers. Presence of E. bugandensis and co-existing species in ISS metagenomic samples We downloaded the 42 paired-end metagenomics reads of the environmental samples from ISS during the MT-1 mission from  Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with the project accession PRJNA438545 [19]. The metadata for all the samples, including the run ID, sample size, and sample name, is available in Supplementary Table 2. We used the MetaSUB Core Analysis Modular Pipeline (CAMP) (https://github.com/MetaSUB-CAMP) to preprocess the samples and predict the taxonomic profiles of the metagenomic samples. Within the CAMP pipeline, the quality of the reads was assessed using FastQC v.0.12.0, following which low-quality reads were filtered out using fastp v.0.22.0 and adapter sequences were removed using AdapterRemoval v.2.3.3. Subsequently, host reads were removed after aligning it to the human genome (GRCh38, without alternate contigs) using Bowtie2 v.2.4.5. Sequencing errors were corrected using Tadpole v.8.22. We further employed the CAMP short-read taxonomy pipeline to generate taxonomical classification and relative abundance data for all metagenomic samples with non-human reads. The pipeline uses BBMask within BBMap v.35.85 to mask the metagenomes to prevent false positives in low-complexity or highly conserved regions in bacterial genomes. We then ran Kraken2 v.2.1.2, with a read length cut-off of 150, to classify reads and determine the closest matching species. We used Bracken v.2.7 on the output of Kraken2 to estimate the relative abundance of species in each sample. Reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic models To gain insights into the microbial interactions of E. bugandensis in the ISS, our primary focus was on identifying the viable microbiome associated with this bacterium. To achieve this, we analysed samples treated exclusively with propidium monoazide (PMA), which retains only viable and intact cells. For our analysis, we specifically considered only those samples containing E. bugandensis. Additionally, we limited our study to bacteria that coexist with E. bugandensis, having a relative abundance of > 1% among all bacteria present at the respective location. We obtained representative genome sequences of the co-existing bacteria from the GenBank sequence database. To construct the Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs), these genomes were processed through KBase (https://www.kbase.us/). The bacterial genomes were initially annotated using the RASTtk toolkit v1.073 [64]. Subsequently, the Build Metabolic Model v.2.0.0 app was used to reconstruct the models based on the ModelSEED pipeline [65]. Appropriate templates, such as Gram-positive or Gram-negative, were selected for the reconstruction process. We further gap-filled the models using RefGlucoseMinimal medium from the KBase public media database, with a maximum uptake of Glucose to 10 mmol/gDW-h. These resulting models were then utilised for both graph-theoretic and constraint-based analyses. Exploring the metabolic interactions of E. bugandensis in ISS We simulated genome-scale models using a comprehensive set of metabolites believed to be necessary for the growth of the microbial community aboard the ISS. This metabolite set combines the minimal medium of each metabolic model with essential cofactors and coenzymes, as reported previously [13]. To determine the minimal media for microbial communities, we employed the minimal_media_from_cobrapy function from MetQuest v.2.0, which ensures the necessary components for a minimum growth rate of 0.1 h-1 of all members in the community [66]. We further used MetQuest v.2.0 for constructing bipartite graphs that represent the metabolic framework of microorganisms. These graphs represent the interplay of reactions within the microbial community and helped us identify active and stuck reactions for the given set of metabolites using a guided breadth-first search approach. The extent of metabolic benefit for each pair in the community was measured using the Metabolic Support Index (MSI) according to the following equation: MSIA|AB=1-nstuckA|ABnstuckA 1 Here, nstuckA and nstuckA|AB are the numbers of stuck reactions in the wild-type and pair-wise community structures. The metabolic dependencies were quantified based on the number of stuck reactions that were relieved by the developed community networks. To predict the nature of microbial interactions, we employed SteadyCom, an optimisation framework for rapid linear programming problem-solving. This framework allowed us to estimate the biomass production rates of every microbial member in the community in a time-averaged, steady-state manner [24]. The pairwise effect of microbes in any given community was expressed through the equation: Effect of A on B=vbio,AB-vbio,Bvbio,B 2 Here, vbio,B and vbio,AB are the biomass production rate of the organism B (wild-type) and the community (AB), respectively. For SteadyCom simulation, the same media as before was used, with a constrained uptake rate of −10 mmol/gDW-h. We considered a significant change in growth when there was a 10% difference in the growth rate of an organism within the community compared to its individual growth rate. Based on the calculated values from the equation (i.e. the effect of A on B and the effect of B on A), we classified microbial interactions into six broad types: mutualism (+,+), parasitism (+,−), commensalism (+,0 or 0,+), amensalism (−,0 or 0,−), competition (−,−), and neutral (0,0).",
    "results": "Results Phylogenetic distinction of ISS E. bugandensis from terrestrial isolates We obtained 211 assembled genomes, annotated as E. bugandensis, from the publicly available ’s () GenBank sequence database [20]. Among these genomes, 12 were isolated from three different locations aboard the ISS during the first Flight of the MT-1 mission: four from the Air Control (AC) samples, one from the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), and seven from the Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Additionally, one metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was recovered from the WHC samples. To ensure the taxonomic affiliation of these genomes, we calculated the average nucleotide identity (ANI) by comparing them to the E. bugandensis type-strain EB-247T (= DSM 29888T) [14]. The ANI values of all 211 strains examined ranged from 97.74 to 100%, confirming their species-level taxonomic affiliation (> 95%) [21]. The genomes isolated from the ISS exhibited an average ANI of 98.61%. Furthermore, we observed that E. bugandensis was predominantly isolated from human hosts, accounting for approximately 81% of all isolates, followed by non-human hosts/environmental sources (11%). Detailed information on the genomes, including their isolation sources, ANI, as well as other relevant aspects, are presented in Supplementary Table 1. We employed four different phylogeny construction methods, including single-copy core gene-based (n = 172 marker genes) and SNP-based approaches and found that the ISS genomes formed a separate clade from strains present in other Earth environments and hosts (Figs. 2 and 3, Supplementary Fig. 1). Notably, one strain, AR1358 from Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang, China, clustered closely with the ISS isolates across all trees. To investigate deeper into the ISS strains’ placement, we compared them to the E. bugandensis type-strain EB-247T and closely related human isolate, AR1358, at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and other mutational levels. The ISS isolates showed an average of 36,044 (s.d. = 24.04) SNPs compared to the type-strain. We found that ISS strains had significantly more SNPs (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p-value = 0.019) than the closely associated human isolates (strains in the right panel of Fig. 2). A comparative analysis of ISS strains with the closest Earth strain, AR1358, revealed significant differences of 3238 SNPs, 14 indels, and 578 complex mutations on average. However, these genetic variations were evenly observed among the isolates. An SNP-based tree showed the ISS isolates form a separate clade even from the closest Earth strain, indicating isolates from other sources (e.g. leaves, human urine, seawater) did not cluster with ISS strains in our SNP-based analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). These results reveal that E. bugandensis strains from the ISS show notable genetic differences compared to their Earth counterparts. This prompted us to investigate deeper into the comparative genomics, antimicrobial traits, and functional features of ISS strains, especially in relation to other microorganisms they coexist with.

Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of E. bugandensis constructed using 172 marker genes of Gammaproteobacteria showing the distinct clade of ISS isolates/MAG apart from the other Earth-based isolation sources. The clade with 32 genomes, which includes 12 ISS isolates and one MAG, is highlighted in the right-side panelFig. 3. Open in a new tab Hierarchical clustering visualisation depicting the functional profiles of E. bugandensis based on COG annotations. In this figure, columns represent COGs, and rows represent individual samples. The pointed yellow box indicates the COGs specifically present in the genomes of the ISS strains E. bugandensis strains isolated from the ISS might have evolved functionally under extreme conditions We identified and annotated every open reading frame (ORFs, i.e. coding sequences of isolated genomes) in each of the 211 genomes/MAG. Our analysis yielded a total of 945,562 coding sequences (CDS) with 2660 distinct Clusters of Orthologous Gene (COG) annotations. Although the above-mentioned phylogenetic analyses suggested genetic variations in the E. bugandensis strains from the ISS, they did not clarify how these variations translate into functional changes. A comparative analysis of COGs across all 211 genomes revealed that the ISS genomes exhibited a relatively higher average gene count in categories such as amino acid transport and metabolism, mobilome (prophages and transposons), and transcription factors (Supplementary Table 1). To better understand these COG patterns, we constructed a presence–absence matrix for unique COGs across the genomes, followed by hierarchical clustering. This approach also identified a distinct clade formed by the ISS genomes, indicating not only genetic divergence but also functional distinctiveness compared to other E. bugandensis strains (Fig. 3). We further identified 14 COGs exclusively present in the ISS genomes (100%) while being rarely detected in Earth genomes (< 10%). These encompass a range of functions, including amino acid transport and metabolism (COG2423), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (COG0464, COG4678), mobilome elements (COG3335, COG3600, COG5545), transcription (COG0454, COG0864), and others with yet unknown or predicted functions. For a comprehensive understanding, we constructed a pan-genome comprising 13,936 gene clusters, including 3836 core and 10,100 accessory gene clusters across all isolated E. bugandensis strains (Supplementary Fig. 2). The ISS genomes exhibited an average of 4568 genes, a significantly higher count than the average of 4416 genes found in the Earth genomes. Focusing on the additional genes, we similarly identified a distinct subset exclusively present in the ISS genomes (100% present in ISS genomes and < 10% in Earth genomes). This subset comprised 82 non-hypothetical genes, though annotations for these genes remained limited. This subset included genes such as alanine racemase, biosynthetic (alr), lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding periplasmic protein (argT), fragments of the astCADBE operon, and others pivotal in amino acid transport and metabolism. Additionally, a prevalence of transcriptional regulator genes observed, including HTH-type transcriptional repressors (comR, rspR, yahB, nimR, yhjB, yybR), transcriptional repressor PifC, and pentachlorophenol (PCP) degradation transcriptional activation protein. We also noticed the presence of essential elements such as the two-component regulatory system BvgAS, known for its pivotal role in controlling the expression of virulence factors and genes crucial for bacterial adaptation and pathogenicity. Furthermore, stress-associated genes like antitoxin components of the type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system (antitoxin HigA, antitoxin SocA, antitoxin ParD1, toxin ParE1) and SOS response systems (LexA repressor, ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH 4) were notable findings. Transporters also featured prominently in that gene set, encompassing histidine transport system permease proteins (hisM, hisP, hisQ), octopine transport system permease protein occM, inner membrane transport protein YdhP, and glutamine transport ATP-binding protein GlnQ (glnQ). These observations motivated a comprehensive gene-level pan-genome association study with the aim of unravelling the genes linked with E. bugandensis in the ISS. Effectively accounting for population stratification due to shared lineages, we performed genome-wide associations among 4696 gene sequences, ranging from 5 to 100% occurrence across all genomes. Importantly, our study further underscored the significant association of previously identified genes, from the pan-genome study, with ISS adaptation after adjustments for false discovery rates (pBH< 0.001) (Supplementary Table 1). Presence of antibiotic resistance genes and mechanisms in ISS E. bugandensis In the E. bugandensis genomes collected from the ISS, we looked for antibiotic resistance genes using the CARD database [22] and calculated sequence identity with the reference databases (Supplementary Table 1). We found that these genomes harbour resistance to 23 different multidrug classes, including cephalosporin, cephamycin, fluoroquinolone, and nitroimidazole antibiotics. Notably, a gene from the ACT β-lactamase family (ACT-77) was present across all 13 genomes, exhibiting 99.48% sequence identity and 100% coverage. Additionally, we identified other MDR genes, such as cyclic AMP receptor protein (Crp), fosfomycin resistance gene (fosA2), and histone-like protein H-NS (H-NS), showing sequence identities of 99.05%, 96.45%, and 95.59%, respectively. Further, a total of 35 antibiotic resistance ontologies (ARO) were predicted across almost all the ISS E. bugandensis genomes. We then looked into the mechanism of antibiotic resistance and identified four mechanisms: antibiotic target alteration, antibiotic efflux, reduced permeability to antibiotics, and antibiotic inactivation. Moreover, certain organisms utilised combinations of these mechanisms to gain resistance against the antibiotics. However, these genes and mechanisms are not exclusive to ISS strains and are found in other Earth species as well (Supplementary Fig. 3). Since the ISS genomes are closely associated with the human isolates (Fig. 2), these findings raise concerns about potential significant antibiotic resistance within the ISS environment. Microbial co-occurrence network reveals potential succession of E. bugandensis in ISS Next, we focused on investigating the potential succession of E. bugandensis in the challenging environment of the ISS. To achieve this, we conducted a detailed analysis of metagenomic reads derived from 42 samples collected during the MT-1 mission and assessed the abundance of E. bugandensis in the ISS (details in the “Methods” section). Further, we segregated the samples into two groups based on the samples treated with and without propidium monoazide (PMA). Our analysis revealed the evidence of potential succession of E. bugandensis across the environments within the ISS during multiple flights (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 4). Being interested in understanding microbial interactions, we focused on the samples treated with PMA, to account only for viable and intact microorganisms [23]. During Flight 1, E. bugandensis demonstrated substantial abundance in four distinct locations (1, 2, 3, and 5). This prevalence underwent a reduction during the subsequent Flight 2, with only two locations (3 and 5) displaying its presence. We further noticed a resurgence in the prevalence of E. bugandensis during the third flight, being present in all sampled locations. The highest abundance of E. bugandensis was observed in Location 2 (forward side panel wall of the WHC) during Flight 1 (relative abundance = 86.7%). However, the median of the absolute read counts for E. bugandensis was less during Flight 1 (1530) when compared to Flight 2 (1698) and Flight 3 (2673). Sampling at precise locations identified during Flight 1 facilitated continuity in the microbial monitoring carried out in Flights 2 and 3. This approach was instrumental in decoding the microbial succession patterns on the surfaces within the ISS. The emergence of novel microbial populations may correlate with the crew transition from Flight 2 to Flight 3. An earlier study by Checinska et al. had reported that no environmental parameters had been altered during the flights [1]. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Metagenomic analysis reveals the prevalence of E. bugandensis and other Enterobacteriaceae within the ISS environment. A Variation in the abundance of E. bugandensis is shown across flights and treatment categories (PMA vs. non-PMA), aggregating all locations. B Comparison between E. bugandensis reads (in blue) and other Enterobacteriaceae reads (in red) across distinct locations of ISS (with a confirmed presence of E. bugandensis) Moving forward, we probed into the microbial communities coexisting with E. bugandensis within the ISS environments. We focused on bacteria that displayed a relative abundance of > 1% alongside E. bugandensis in the metagenomic samples. This analysis revealed several patterns in the microbial co-occurring networks, as shown in Fig. 5. During Flight 1, we observed distinct microbial dominance among the four locations where E. bugandensis was prevalent. For instance, Location 1 was characterised by a prevalence of Klebsiella, Location 3 by Methylobacterium, and Location 5 by Pantoea, while E. bugandensis itself held dominance in Location 2. However, during Flight 2, E. bugandensis presence was limited to Locations 3 and 5. In Location 3, we noticed an exciting abundance of Gram-positive bacteria, including Corynebacterium sp. sy039, Cutibacterium acnes, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 431. In contrast, Location 5 was dominated by members of the Erwiniaceae family, such as Erwinia and Pantoea species. While the abundance profile of E. bugandensis remained almost consistent across ISS flights, during Flight 3, E. bugandensis showed its adaptability, occupying nearly all ISS locations (Fig. 4B). A family-level diversity analysis highlighted the continued dominance of the Erwiniaceae family, particularly the Pantoea genus, in most locations (Supplementary Fig. 4). Nevertheless, Location 3 exhibited significant abundance of Staphylococcaceae. The details of absolute and relative abundances of organisms and their co-presence network are provided in Supplementary Table 2. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab The panel illustrates the co-presence networks ( n = 3) of microorganisms that inhabit locations with a relative abundance > 1%. The hexagonal nodes represent ISS locations, while circular nodes symbolise the microorganisms. Microbial nodes are colour-coded with grey, indicating microorganisms present in multiple locations. The size of the node corresponds to the number of locations E. bugandensis) E. bugandensis potentially influences metabolic dynamics of coexisting microorganisms We further investigated the metabolic interactions among these co-occurring microorganisms of E. bugandensis. For this, we constructed 47 genome-scale metabolic models and simulated them on the described media (details in the “Methods” section). To evaluate the effect of the surrounding bacteria on E. bugandensis metabolism, we calculated the pairwise Metabolic Support Index (MSI) for 957 identified communities. MSI is a directional measure that indicates the gain in metabolic potential of a microorganism while in a community compared to its isolated state. In our findings, we observed 645 nonzero MSI interactions ranging from 0.069 to 1.061%. Specifically focusing on the predicted interactions involving E. bugandensis, we noticed that it can provide significant metabolic benefits to Gram-positive microorganisms (Fig. 6A). Notably, Staphylococcus saprophyticus from Flight 1, Location 1, received the highest MSI of 1.06% among others, followed closely by Staphylococcus hominis (0.96%) at Flight 3, Location 2, and Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.96%) during Flight 2, Location 3. Additionally, we observed a slight metabolic advantage for organisms from the Erwiniaceae family in their interactions with E. bugandensis. The genus Methylobacterium received an average MSI of 0.11%. Furthermore, E. bugandensis did not derive significant metabolic benefits (< 0.1%) from any coexisting organisms. This suggests that E. bugandensis possibly maintains metabolic competitiveness within these communities. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Microbial interactions involving E. bugandensis and other community members. A The heatmap presents the span of pairwise Metabolic Support Indices (MSI) provided by E. bugandensis (left panel in blue) as well as MSI values received by E. bugandensis (right panel in orange) from the community members. These values are expressed as percentages. B The network diagrams provide insight into the type of key interactions involving E. bugandensis and specific coexisting microorganisms: (i) Pantoea species, (ii) Methylobacterium species, (iii) Klebsiella species, and (iv) Gram-positive species. The colour and direction of the arrowheads on the edges signify the type of observed interaction provided in the legend. The edge labels indicate the Flight–Location where the specific interaction type was observed. For clarity, the nodes representing E. bugandensis have been distinguished E. bugandensis is predicted to affect the growth of coexisting microorganisms To investigate the impact of the microbial community on microbial growth, we employed the constraint-based method SteadyCom [24] to analyse the interactions between E. bugandensis and its coexisting microbiota. Based on the changes in growth rate as compared to wild-type conditions, we classified the interactions into six types (described in the “Methods” section). Our analysis predicted a total of 947 pairwise interactions across seven locations during three flights of the MT-1 mission. Among these interactions, we observed a prevalence of “negative” interactions, such as parasitism (441) and amensalism (412), followed by 34 mutualistic, 31 competitive, 26 commensalistic, and three neutral interactions. Focusing on E. bugandensis, we explored 126 interactions with its coexisting microorganisms. Among these, 63 were parasitic, where E. bugandensis predominantly acted as the parasitic organism while reaping benefits from other organisms. Additionally, we noted 45 amensalism, 12 mutualistic, four commensalistic, and two competitive interactions involving E. bugandensis. Notably, Pantoea species were prominent in interactions with E. bugandensis during all three flights. While Pantoea was mainly present in Location 5 during flights 1 and 2, it appeared in almost all ISS locations during Flight 3. E. bugandensis significantly reduced growth rates for several Pantoea strains, including Pantoea agglomerans, Pantoea alhagi, Pantoea dispersa 625, Pantoea rwandensis, Pantoea sp. At-9b, Pantoea sp. CCBC3-3-1, Pantoea sp. PS1, Pantoea sp. SO10, Pantoea stewartii, and Pantoea vagans, suggesting its parasitic role. However, one exception was Pantoea ananatis PA13, which showed mutualism with E. bugandensis, leading to a significant growth advantage for both microorganisms (Fig. 6B). Moreover, in the family Erwiniaceae, microorganisms like Erwinia gerundensis, Mixta calida, and Mixta gaviniae, displayed parasitism, while Mixta theicola displayed amensalistic interactions, favouring growth advantage for E. bugandensis. Escherichia coli also interacted amensalistically with E. bugandensis at Location 1 during Flight 1, leading to its significant growth reduction. Another group of pathogenic species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Klebsiella sp. LY, and Klebsiella variicola, coexisted with E. bugandensis during Flight 1 and 3 in several locations. E. bugandensis exhibited amensalistic interactions with Klebsiella species, leading to a negative growth rate for Klebsiella. Conversely, E. bugandensis displayed parasitism towards K. aerogenes (Fig. 6B). E. bugandensis also displayed positive associations with certain Gram-positive bacteria. Paenibacillus polymyxa, present in Locations 3 and 5 during Flight 2, showed commensalism in the presence of E. bugandensis, resulting in a growth advantage. Additionally, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus exhibited mutualism, while Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 431 displayed commensalism. E. bugandensis demonstrated competitive interaction against closely associated species Enterobacteriaceae bacterium S05 and amensalisitic to Enterobacter cloacae with a negative effect on E. bugandensis. Interestingly, in Location 3 of Flight 1, we observed that several Methylobacterium species interacted with E. bugandensis in a parasitic manner. This facilitated an increased growth for Methylobacterium and subsequently a decreased growth for E. bugandensis (Fig. 5B). Methylobacterium phyllosphaerae had the most significant effect from this interaction. However, a few Methylobacterium species, including Methylobacterium aquaticum, Methylobacterium brachiatum, Methylobacterium durans, and Methylobacterium mesophilicum SR1.6/6, showed commensalistic, mutualistic, mutualistic, and amensalism interactions, respectively. Detailed information on the nature of interactions for all pairs can be found in Supplementary Table 3.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we discussed the adaptation of a multidrug-resistant, nosocomial BSL-2 pathogen, E. bugandensis, in the unique built environment of the ISS, and its potential succession. Several studies have highlighted the prevalence of microorganisms on ISS surfaces associated with humans, including opportunistic pathogens and discussed the importance of studying them [1, 3]. E. bugandensis, which is also an opportunistic pathogen, was observed to be present in the ISS during the cataloguing of viable microbial communities [1, 19]. Such organisms pose potential threats to astronauts on the ISS, though the exact mechanisms behind their behaviour in space remain unknown. The impact on astronaut health would likely depend on individual health status and how these microorganisms function in extreme space environments. Hence, it is crucial to explore genomic and metabolic studies to understand the functionality of these microorganisms and their potential implications for astronaut well-being. While some attempts have been made to understand the effect of pathogens like A. pittii [25] and K. pneumoniae [13, 26] under stress conditions on the ISS, there is still much more to explore. In this study, we have not limited our analyses to a mere comparison between Earth and ISS isolates of E. bugandensis. Instead, we adopted a unique threefold approach to unravel the potential succession of E. bugandensis in the ISS. Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide analysis to identify the genomic and functionality changes acquired by E. bugandensis during its adaptation to the extreme space environment. Secondly, we quantified the abundance of E. bugandensis in the ISS across multiple flights of the MT-1 mission. Additionally, we looked into the coexisting microbial population of E. bugandensis through a detailed metagenomic analysis. Lastly, we elucidated the metabolic interactions of these organisms and how they contribute to shaping the community structure within the ISS. Through this multi-faceted approach, we were able to explain the survival and dynamics of E. bugandensis in the ISS environment. Recent studies have also indicated the potential role of increased amino acid biosynthesis in the successful colonisation of stressed environments by bacteria such as Salmonella, which is also from the Enterobacteriaceae family [27]. Another operon, astCADBE, known to be involved in arginine and ornithine transport and metabolism, was present in ISS strains and plays a significant role in virulence in enteric pathogens through arginine catabolism [28]. Furthermore, we identified the gene encoding alanine racemase, a key enzyme transforming L-alanine to D-alanine—an essential step in cell wall biosynthesis. Under stress, this enzyme might play a pivotal role in bacterial adaptation and survival by facilitating D-alanine production for cell wall repair and maintenance [29]. Moreover, the higher prevalence of genes in ISS genomes than their Earth counterparts strongly suggests that ISS strains were able to acquire essential accessory genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. This hypothesis is further reinforced by the increased abundance of COGs related to mobilome elements (COG3335, COG3600, COG5545). Further, our analysis revealed the presence of genes associated with SOS response systems, including the LexA repressor and ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH 4. LexA, notably prevalent in ISS but scarce in Earth strains (< 10%), suggests potential selection pressure on E. bugandensis’s DNA damage response, likely induced by the elevated radiation levels and other adversities experienced aboard the ISS. In E. coli and various bacteria, the LexA protein plays a pivotal role in regulating the SOS response to DNA damage, influencing cellular adaptation to stress [30]. We also noted the existence of toxin-antitoxin systems (TAs), which are widely distributed among bacteria and play a critical role in the evolution and propagation of antibiotic resistance, such as the maintenance of multi-resistant plasmids and the induction of persistence [31]. A subset of genes related to type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, including antitoxin components (HigA, SocA, ParD1) and toxin ParE1, participates in plasmid maintenance [32], stress response [33], and biofilm production [31], thereby enhancing bacterial resilience and virulence. Additionally, the presence of the BvgAS two-component regulatory system, typically observed in Bordetella species, is of interest. This system, often referred to as the “master virulence regulator”, controls the activation of virulence genes in various Bordetella species through its components: the histidine kinase BvgS and the response regulator BvgA [34]. Our findings also highlighted the presence of Imm (Colicin-E2 immunity protein), a crucial element providing immunity to colicin E2, which are antimicrobial proteins produced by E. coli under stress conditions as a defence mechanism [35, 36]. Through a comprehensive genome-wide association study, we systematically assessed the identified genes from the pan-genome for their potential links to observed phenotypic traits, considering population stratification. We identified certain genes from our study that are exclusively present in organisms associated with the ISS, but not in their terrestrial counterpart. These include inner membrane protein YbjJ in Bacillus cereus from the ISS [37], transcriptional repressor LexA, and ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH-4 in Acinetobacter pittii from the ISS [25], as well as the bvgAS system in Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34, known for its resilience in harsh environments and also observed in the ISS [38]. These genes could potentially serve as valuable targets for therapeutics against pathogenic microorganisms in the unique environment of the ISS. This analysis demonstrated a distinct association of the identified genes with ISS isolates, further corroborating their relevance to the specific environmental conditions aboard the ISS. The antimicrobial resistance profile is also of interest, mainly due to the fact that ISS strains exhibit distinct phenotypes compared to their Earth-based counterparts yet display similar antimicrobial resistance signatures (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, Singh et al. [19] have indicated a significant increment in antimicrobial-resistant genes during Flight 3 compared to Flights 1 and 2, highlighting the potential persistence of opportunistic pathogens in Flight 3 samples, which is also shown in our study. We have identified multiple MDR gene classes (14 in total) within the ISS strains. Among these, the presence of ACT (AmpC-type cephalosporinase) β-lactamase genes is interesting. Although previous studies have reported the presence of blaCTX-M-55, blaNDM-5, and blaIMI-1 in the broader E. bugandensis population [39], our analysis did not reveal these specific genes within the ISS strains. Additionally, we identified the vanG gene, typically associated with Vancomycin Resistance Locus primarily observed in Enterococcus faecalis [40]. Another finding was the presence of KpnEF, a cell envelope stress response regulon, and an SMR-type efflux pump associated with broad-spectrum antimicrobial resistance, commonly observed in K. pneumoniae [41]. Considering the close genetic proximity to Earth strains, especially hospital isolates like AR1358, these MDR genes and associated mechanisms raise concerns. These genetic elements are likely acquired by E. bugandensis through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events, potentially contributing to their MDR capabilities. Next, we set out to estimate the abundance of E. bugandensis in the ISS metagenomic samples. Our findings revealed that E. bugandensis exhibits prevalence and varying relative abundance across different locations within the space station. There were no significant differences in the absolute abundance of E. bugandensis between PMA- and non-PMA-treated samples, suggesting that the DNA retrieved from this opportunistic pathogen residing on ISS is viable and intact. E. bugandensis was found to be persistent across the ARED (Location 3) and the Zero-G Stowage Rack (ZSR; Location 5) throughout all three flights of the MT-1 mission (Fig. 5). Despite its presence in all locations, the relative abundance of E. bugandensis was generally low, except for a substantial burden observed at Location 2 during Flight 1 (Supplementary Table 2). These observations further motivated us to examine the associated microbiota co-existing with E. bugandensis on the ISS. Our analysis found that E. bugandensis coexists with a group of Pantoea species at multiple locations across all flights, particularly in the ZSR (Location 5). Although both Enterobacter and Pantoea belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae, they exhibit high diversity [42] and have been reported to coexist in other environments, including hospital ICUs [43] and sugarcane tissues [44]. E. bugandensis also interacted with several Klebsiella species within the same family Enterobacteriaceae, mainly at the Cupola (Flight 1) and ARED (Flight 3). E. bugandensis is a common human commensal [45, 46] but can act as an opportunistic pathogen, co-infecting immunocompromised individuals (e.g. COVID-infected patients) [47], and have the ability to transfer plasmids through HGT events [48, 49]. Studies have also demonstrated the co-presence of Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Paenibacillus, and Pantoea as bacterial endophytes in cereals and Enterobacter sp., Mixta sp., and Pantoea sp. in germinating seeds [50]. To further explore and quantify their interaction patterns, we employed two widely applied computational approaches: (i) graph-theoretical approach to estimate metabolic dependencies and (ii) constraint-based modelling to examine the nature of their interactions. Our study, while informative, does come with certain limitations. In our comprehensive genomic exploration of E. bugandensis, we uncovered genes linked to the ISS environment. Firstly, the limited number of E. bugandensis genomes collected from the ISS, in comparison to Earth isolates, may impact the robustness of our genomic findings. One challenge we encountered was the presence of numerous genes with inadequate annotations, many of which were hypothetical proteins. A comparative study by Lobb et al. [48] reported that Prokka, a widely used annotation tool, demonstrated a mean proteome annotation coverage of 52 ± 9%. However, it is essential to note that Prokka’s functional annotation parameters are stringent, relying solely on reference proteins with experimental evidence for functional assignments. Moreover, while our study strongly suggests adaptation and a “potential” succession of E. bugandensis in the ISS environment, we acknowledge that true succession assessment would ideally involve techniques such as qPCR or ecological-scale analyses. However, we strengthened our hypothesis for the likelihood of adaptation based on multiple converging analyses employing diverse approaches. Furthermore, the metabolic models we constructed are draft models generated from representative type strains of the organisms. Although we employed default gap-filling options using ModelSEED, these models may still have gaps and could differ from the actual isolates. Despite these limitations, such automated reconstruction models are widely used for studying metabolic characteristics and predicting microbial interactions [51]. Also, our models were simulated under minimal medium conditions along with specific cofactors, thereby representing environmental communities with limited rich medium contents. Although some microbial interactions might remain stable in various nutrient-rich settings, others may vary based on the distinct metabolic capacities of the interacting pairs. While exploring microbial interactions in extreme communities, we employed a graph-based approach for exploring the metabolic dependencies among the members. Our findings suggested that Gram-positive organisms (e.g. Staphylococcus) often rely on metabolic support from Gram-negative counterparts such as Enterobacter, Pantoea, and Klebsiella genera. Moreover, studies from the ISS surface microbiome of the US module as well as the Japan module have shown that microorganisms belonging to the family Staphylococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were the most dominant organisms on ISS surfaces [1, 52]. Focusing on E. bugandensis, we observed that it receives limited metabolic support from coexisting microorganisms, suggesting its positioning as a higher-level contributor within the community’s food chain. In contrast, most community members appear to derive some form of metabolic support from E. bugandensis, albeit nominal in most instances. This finding is consistent with recent research indicating the significance of Enterobacteriaceae in facilitating beneficial interactions among microorganisms, whereas families like Erwiniaceae and Staphylococcaceae contributed less to metabolic support [13]. However, these interactions provide a static snapshot of metabolic interaction potential and do not really capture the nature of interactions. Thus, we introduced a complementary constraint-based method to predict the nature of interactions based on growth rates. This combined approach offers a more comprehensive view of microbial interactions. Our investigation extended to the specific impact of E. bugandensis on other microorganisms. We elucidated possible effects on plant-associated microbes, such as Pantoea and Methylobacterium, suggesting a potential overlap in resource utilisation for growth (Fig. 6B). The prevalence of Methylobacterium across the ISS, known for its resilience in challenging environments, underscores its adaptability to extreme conditions from NASA spacecraft assembly clean rooms [53] to hospital intensive care units (ICUs) [54]. Additionally, our study highlighted the reciprocal influence between E. bugandensis and Klebsiella species, suggesting a potential reduction in the growth rate for Klebsiella (Fig. 6B). A recent study indicated the interaction between Enterobacter species and clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and their implications for antibiotic resistance patterns [55]. This study also illustrated how the presence of E. bugandensis influences Gram-positive organisms (Fig. 6B). Nevertheless, while our metabolic modelling approach predicts antagonistic and parasitic behaviours, further experimentation is required to validate these predictions against other opportunistic microbial pathogens.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion In this study, we presented a robust and comprehensive methodology to decipher the survival mechanisms of the clinically significant microorganism, E. bugandensis, within the challenging environment of the ISS. Through a synergistic integration of genomics, metagenomics, and metabolic modelling, we unravelled the potential strategies employed by E. bugandensis for adaptation and persistence in the unique ISS ecosystem. Our approach holds promise for broader applications, especially in terrestrial controlled settings such as hospital ICUs and surgical theatres. Ultimately, our findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of microbial dynamics in extreme environments, laying a solid foundation for future hypotheses and expanding the horizons of microbial ecology research.",

Copyright notice ID: 10960378 PMID: 38521963 Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human achievement in space exploration. Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO2 levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is Enterobacter bugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections.Results Distinct from their Earth counterparts, ISS E. bugandensis strains have exhibited resistance mechanisms that categorise them within the ESKAPE pathogen group, a collection of pathogens recognised for their formidable resistance to antimicrobial treatments. During the 2-year Microbial Tracking 1 mission, 13 strains of multidrug-resistant E. bugandensis were isolated from various locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive study to understand the genomic intricacies of ISS-derived E. bugandensis in comparison to terrestrial strains, with a keen focus on those associated with clinical infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on Earth, could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, we meticulously mapped the prevalence and distribution of E. bugandensis across the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the persistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonisation of E. bugandensis in space. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting microbial communities alongside E. bugandensis in the ISS across multiple missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate microbial interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the ISS.Conclusions Our comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession of E. bugandensis within the ISS environment. The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, they shed light on microbial behaviour, adaptation, and evolution in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic threats.

The International Space Station (ISS), a highly controlled built environment harbouring extreme conditions such as microgravity, solar radiation, and elevated CO2 levels, offers a unique place for studying microbial survival and adaptation [1]. Recent studies have demonstrated that microorganisms exposed to microgravity can acquire antibiotic resistance and heightened virulence via rapid mutations and horizontal gene transfer [2–4]. Prolonged space travel under microgravity can also compromise astronauts’ immune systems, elevating their vulnerability to diseases [5]. The microbial population of the ISS might potentially impact astronauts’ microbiomes and get replenished by the arrival of new crew [6]. Thus, understanding microbial colonisation, succession, and interactions is pivotal for ensuring astronaut well-being and managing microbial risks in isolated and confined human habitats. Persistent efforts have been made to monitor the ISS microbiome through multiple microbial tracking missions [3, 7], identifying novel microorganisms [8–11], studying antibiotic resistance [12] to unveiling microbial interactions [13]. Enterobacter bugandensis, a newly recognised species, emerges as one of the important opportunistic pathogens within the Enterobacter genus and has been isolated predominantly from clinical specimens [14, 15]. Species from this Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic genus exist in various environments, from soil to the human gut [16]. In addition, some Enterobacter species act as opportunistic human pathogens, causing nosocomial infections with bacteremia, lower respiratory tract, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and urinary tract infection [17]. Moreover, with time, Enterobacter isolates have been shown to manifest multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, AmpC overexpression, and altered membrane permeability [18], and have been designated as a member of ESKAPE pathogen group, recognised for their antimicrobial resistance prowess. Interestingly, recent studies have reported the isolation of 13 multi-drug resistant E. bugandensis strains from the ISS during the Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) mission [1, 19]. Motivated by the presence of E. bugandensis on the ISS, our central aim was to compare ISS-derived E. bugandensis genomes with their terrestrial counterparts, with an emphasis on clinical isolates. We trace the evolutionary dynamics of pivotal genes, including those involved in putative functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, possibly driven by the unique stresses of space. Expanding our investigations, we further examined metagenomic reads to map the prevalence of E. bugandensis across diverse ISS locations, capturing its temporal dynamics. In addition, we explored the coexisting microbial communities of E. bugandensis in ISS across multiple flights and locations. Subsequently, the intricate microbial interactions of E. bugandensis within the ISS were unveiled using a combination of robust computational approaches. This comprehensive analysis (Fig. 1) not only sheds light on how these interactions influence microbial diversity and contribute to the potential succession of E. bugandensis within the unique ISS habitat but also aids in designing strategic preventive measures against infections caused by pathogens. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Illustrative workflow showcasing the process of comparative genomics analysis of E. bugandensis, evaluating its prevalence and metabolic interactions within the microbial community, and its successful adaptation within the ISS habitatResults Phylogenetic distinction of ISS E. bugandensis from terrestrial isolates We obtained 211 assembled genomes, annotated as E. bugandensis, from the publicly available ’s () GenBank sequence database [20]. Among these genomes, 12 were isolated from three different locations aboard the ISS during the first Flight of the MT-1 mission: four from the Air Control (AC) samples, one from the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), and seven from the Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Additionally, one metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was recovered from the WHC samples. To ensure the taxonomic affiliation of these genomes, we calculated the average nucleotide identity (ANI) by comparing them to the E. bugandensis type-strain EB-247T (= DSM 29888T) [14]. The ANI values of all 211 strains examined ranged from 97.74 to 100%, confirming their species-level taxonomic affiliation (> 95%) [21]. The genomes isolated from the ISS exhibited an average ANI of 98.61%. Furthermore, we observed that E. bugandensis was predominantly isolated from human hosts, accounting for approximately 81% of all isolates, followed by non-human hosts/environmental sources (11%). Detailed information on the genomes, including their isolation sources, ANI, as well as other relevant aspects, are presented in Supplementary Table 1. We employed four different phylogeny construction methods, including single-copy core gene-based (n = 172 marker genes) and SNP-based approaches and found that the ISS genomes formed a separate clade from strains present in other Earth environments and hosts (Figs. 2 and 3, Supplementary Fig. 1). Notably, one strain, AR1358 from Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang, China, clustered closely with the ISS isolates across all trees. To investigate deeper into the ISS strains’ placement, we compared them to the E. bugandensis type-strain EB-247T and closely related human isolate, AR1358, at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and other mutational levels. The ISS isolates showed an average of 36,044 (s.d. = 24.04) SNPs compared to the type-strain. We found that ISS strains had significantly more SNPs (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p-value = 0.019) than the closely associated human isolates (strains in the right panel of Fig. 2). A comparative analysis of ISS strains with the closest Earth strain, AR1358, revealed significant differences of 3238 SNPs, 14 indels, and 578 complex mutations on average. However, these genetic variations were evenly observed among the isolates. An SNP-based tree showed the ISS isolates form a separate clade even from the closest Earth strain, indicating isolates from other sources (e.g. leaves, human urine, seawater) did not cluster with ISS strains in our SNP-based analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). These results reveal that E. bugandensis strains from the ISS show notable genetic differences compared to their Earth counterparts. This prompted us to investigate deeper into the comparative genomics, antimicrobial traits, and functional features of ISS strains, especially in relation to other microorganisms they coexist with. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of E. bugandensis constructed using 172 marker genes of Gammaproteobacteria showing the distinct clade of ISS isolates/MAG apart from the other Earth-based isolation sources. The clade with 32 genomes, which includes 12 ISS isolates and one MAG, is highlighted in the right-side panelFig. 3. Open in a new tab Hierarchical clustering visualisation depicting the functional profiles of E. bugandensis based on COG annotations. In this figure, columns represent COGs, and rows represent individual samples. The pointed yellow box indicates the COGs specifically present in the genomes of the ISS strains E. bugandensis strains isolated from the ISS might have evolved functionally under extreme conditions We identified and annotated every open reading frame (ORFs, i.e. coding sequences of isolated genomes) in each of the 211 genomes/MAG. Our analysis yielded a total of 945,562 coding sequences (CDS) with 2660 distinct Clusters of Orthologous Gene (COG) annotations. Although the above-mentioned phylogenetic analyses suggested genetic variations in the E. bugandensis strains from the ISS, they did not clarify how these variations translate into functional changes. A comparative analysis of COGs across all 211 genomes revealed that the ISS genomes exhibited a relatively higher average gene count in categories such as amino acid transport and metabolism, mobilome (prophages and transposons), and transcription factors (Supplementary Table 1). To better understand these COG patterns, we constructed a presence–absence matrix for unique COGs across the genomes, followed by hierarchical clustering. This approach also identified a distinct clade formed by the ISS genomes, indicating not only genetic divergence but also functional distinctiveness compared to other E. bugandensis strains (Fig. 3). We further identified 14 COGs exclusively present in the ISS genomes (100%) while being rarely detected in Earth genomes (< 10%). These encompass a range of functions, including amino acid transport and metabolism (COG2423), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (COG0464, COG4678), mobilome elements (COG3335, COG3600, COG5545), transcription (COG0454, COG0864), and others with yet unknown or predicted functions. For a comprehensive understanding, we constructed a pan-genome comprising 13,936 gene clusters, including 3836 core and 10,100 accessory gene clusters across all isolated E. bugandensis strains (Supplementary Fig. 2). The ISS genomes exhibited an average of 4568 genes, a significantly higher count than the average of 4416 genes found in the Earth genomes. Focusing on the additional genes, we similarly identified a distinct subset exclusively present in the ISS genomes (100% present in ISS genomes and < 10% in Earth genomes). This subset comprised 82 non-hypothetical genes, though annotations for these genes remained limited. This subset included genes such as alanine racemase, biosynthetic (alr), lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding periplasmic protein (argT), fragments of the astCADBE operon, and others pivotal in amino acid transport and metabolism. Additionally, a prevalence of transcriptional regulator genes observed, including HTH-type transcriptional repressors (comR, rspR, yahB, nimR, yhjB, yybR), transcriptional repressor PifC, and pentachlorophenol (PCP) degradation transcriptional activation protein. We also noticed the presence of essential elements such as the two-component regulatory system BvgAS, known for its pivotal role in controlling the expression of virulence factors and genes crucial for bacterial adaptation and pathogenicity. Furthermore, stress-associated genes like antitoxin components of the type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system (antitoxin HigA, antitoxin SocA, antitoxin ParD1, toxin ParE1) and SOS response systems (LexA repressor, ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH 4) were notable findings. Transporters also featured prominently in that gene set, encompassing histidine transport system permease proteins (hisM, hisP, hisQ), octopine transport system permease protein occM, inner membrane transport protein YdhP, and glutamine transport ATP-binding protein GlnQ (glnQ). These observations motivated a comprehensive gene-level pan-genome association study with the aim of unravelling the genes linked with E. bugandensis in the ISS. Effectively accounting for population stratification due to shared lineages, we performed genome-wide associations among 4696 gene sequences, ranging from 5 to 100% occurrence across all genomes. Importantly, our study further underscored the significant association of previously identified genes, from the pan-genome study, with ISS adaptation after adjustments for false discovery rates (pBH< 0.001) (Supplementary Table 1).Presence of antibiotic resistance genes and mechanisms in ISS E. bugandensis In the E. bugandensis genomes collected from the ISS, we looked for antibiotic resistance genes using the CARD database [22] and calculated sequence identity with the reference databases (Supplementary Table 1). We found that these genomes harbour resistance to 23 different multidrug classes, including cephalosporin, cephamycin, fluoroquinolone, and nitroimidazole antibiotics. Notably, a gene from the ACT β-lactamase family (ACT-77) was present across all 13 genomes, exhibiting 99.48% sequence identity and 100% coverage. Additionally, we identified other MDR genes, such as cyclic AMP receptor protein (Crp), fosfomycin resistance gene (fosA2), and histone-like protein H-NS (H-NS), showing sequence identities of 99.05%, 96.45%, and 95.59%, respectively. Further, a total of 35 antibiotic resistance ontologies (ARO) were predicted across almost all the ISS E. bugandensis genomes. We then looked into the mechanism of antibiotic resistance and identified four mechanisms: antibiotic target alteration, antibiotic efflux, reduced permeability to antibiotics, and antibiotic inactivation. Moreover, certain organisms utilised combinations of these mechanisms to gain resistance against the antibiotics. However, these genes and mechanisms are not exclusive to ISS strains and are found in other Earth species as well (Supplementary Fig. 3). Since the ISS genomes are closely associated with the human isolates (Fig. 2), these findings raise concerns about potential significant antibiotic resistance within the ISS environment.Microbial co-occurrence network reveals potential succession of E. bugandensis in ISS Next, we focused on investigating the potential succession of E. bugandensis in the challenging environment of the ISS. To achieve this, we conducted a detailed analysis of metagenomic reads derived from 42 samples collected during the MT-1 mission and assessed the abundance of E. bugandensis in the ISS (details in the “Methods” section). Further, we segregated the samples into two groups based on the samples treated with and without propidium monoazide (PMA). Our analysis revealed the evidence of potential succession of E. bugandensis across the environments within the ISS during multiple flights (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 4). Being interested in understanding microbial interactions, we focused on the samples treated with PMA, to account only for viable and intact microorganisms [23]. During Flight 1, E. bugandensis demonstrated substantial abundance in four distinct locations (1, 2, 3, and 5). This prevalence underwent a reduction during the subsequent Flight 2, with only two locations (3 and 5) displaying its presence. We further noticed a resurgence in the prevalence of E. bugandensis during the third flight, being present in all sampled locations. The highest abundance of E. bugandensis was observed in Location 2 (forward side panel wall of the WHC) during Flight 1 (relative abundance = 86.7%). However, the median of the absolute read counts for E. bugandensis was less during Flight 1 (1530) when compared to Flight 2 (1698) and Flight 3 (2673). Sampling at precise locations identified during Flight 1 facilitated continuity in the microbial monitoring carried out in Flights 2 and 3. This approach was instrumental in decoding the microbial succession patterns on the surfaces within the ISS. The emergence of novel microbial populations may correlate with the crew transition from Flight 2 to Flight 3. An earlier study by Checinska et al. had reported that no environmental parameters had been altered during the flights [1]. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Metagenomic analysis reveals the prevalence of E. bugandensis and other Enterobacteriaceae within the ISS environment. A Variation in the abundance of E. bugandensis is shown across flights and treatment categories (PMA vs. non-PMA), aggregating all locations. B Comparison between E. bugandensis reads (in blue) and other Enterobacteriaceae reads (in red) across distinct locations of ISS (with a confirmed presence of E. bugandensis) Moving forward, we probed into the microbial communities coexisting with E. bugandensis within the ISS environments. We focused on bacteria that displayed a relative abundance of > 1% alongside E. bugandensis in the metagenomic samples. This analysis revealed several patterns in the microbial co-occurring networks, as shown in Fig. 5. During Flight 1, we observed distinct microbial dominance among the four locations where E. bugandensis was prevalent. For instance, Location 1 was characterised by a prevalence of Klebsiella, Location 3 by Methylobacterium, and Location 5 by Pantoea, while E. bugandensis itself held dominance in Location 2. However, during Flight 2, E. bugandensis presence was limited to Locations 3 and 5. In Location 3, we noticed an exciting abundance of Gram-positive bacteria, including Corynebacterium sp. sy039, Cutibacterium acnes, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 431. In contrast, Location 5 was dominated by members of the Erwiniaceae family, such as Erwinia and Pantoea species. While the abundance profile of E. bugandensis remained almost consistent across ISS flights, during Flight 3, E. bugandensis showed its adaptability, occupying nearly all ISS locations (Fig. 4B). A family-level diversity analysis highlighted the continued dominance of the Erwiniaceae family, particularly the Pantoea genus, in most locations (Supplementary Fig. 4). Nevertheless, Location 3 exhibited significant abundance of Staphylococcaceae. The details of absolute and relative abundances of organisms and their co-presence network are provided in Supplementary Table 2. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab The panel illustrates the co-presence networks ( n = 3) of microorganisms that inhabit locations with a relative abundance > 1%. The hexagonal nodes represent ISS locations, while circular nodes symbolise the microorganisms. Microbial nodes are colour-coded with grey, indicating microorganisms present in multiple locations. The size of the node corresponds to the number of locations E. bugandensis) E. bugandensis potentially influences metabolic dynamics of coexisting microorganisms We further investigated the metabolic interactions among these co-occurring microorganisms of E. bugandensis. For this, we constructed 47 genome-scale metabolic models and simulated them on the described media (details in the “Methods” section). To evaluate the effect of the surrounding bacteria on E. bugandensis metabolism, we calculated the pairwise Metabolic Support Index (MSI) for 957 identified communities. MSI is a directional measure that indicates the gain in metabolic potential of a microorganism while in a community compared to its isolated state. In our findings, we observed 645 nonzero MSI interactions ranging from 0.069 to 1.061%. Specifically focusing on the predicted interactions involving E. bugandensis, we noticed that it can provide significant metabolic benefits to Gram-positive microorganisms (Fig. 6A). Notably, Staphylococcus saprophyticus from Flight 1, Location 1, received the highest MSI of 1.06% among others, followed closely by Staphylococcus hominis (0.96%) at Flight 3, Location 2, and Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.96%) during Flight 2, Location 3. Additionally, we observed a slight metabolic advantage for organisms from the Erwiniaceae family in their interactions with E. bugandensis. The genus Methylobacterium received an average MSI of 0.11%. Furthermore, E. bugandensis did not derive significant metabolic benefits (< 0.1%) from any coexisting organisms. This suggests that E. bugandensis possibly maintains metabolic competitiveness within these communities. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Microbial interactions involving E. bugandensis and other community members. A The heatmap presents the span of pairwise Metabolic Support Indices (MSI) provided by E. bugandensis (left panel in blue) as well as MSI values received by E. bugandensis (right panel in orange) from the community members. These values are expressed as percentages. B The network diagrams provide insight into the type of key interactions involving E. bugandensis and specific coexisting microorganisms: (i) Pantoea species, (ii) Methylobacterium species, (iii) Klebsiella species, and (iv) Gram-positive species. The colour and direction of the arrowheads on the edges signify the type of observed interaction provided in the legend. The edge labels indicate the Flight–Location where the specific interaction type was observed. For clarity, the nodes representing E. bugandensis have been distinguished E. bugandensis is predicted to affect the growth of coexisting microorganisms To investigate the impact of the microbial community on microbial growth, we employed the constraint-based method SteadyCom [24] to analyse the interactions between E. bugandensis and its coexisting microbiota. Based on the changes in growth rate as compared to wild-type conditions, we classified the interactions into six types (described in the “Methods” section). Our analysis predicted a total of 947 pairwise interactions across seven locations during three flights of the MT-1 mission. Among these interactions, we observed a prevalence of “negative” interactions, such as parasitism (441) and amensalism (412), followed by 34 mutualistic, 31 competitive, 26 commensalistic, and three neutral interactions. Focusing on E. bugandensis, we explored 126 interactions with its coexisting microorganisms. Among these, 63 were parasitic, where E. bugandensis predominantly acted as the parasitic organism while reaping benefits from other organisms. Additionally, we noted 45 amensalism, 12 mutualistic, four commensalistic, and two competitive interactions involving E. bugandensis. Notably, Pantoea species were prominent in interactions with E. bugandensis during all three flights. While Pantoea was mainly present in Location 5 during flights 1 and 2, it appeared in almost all ISS locations during Flight 3. E. bugandensis significantly reduced growth rates for several Pantoea strains, including Pantoea agglomerans, Pantoea alhagi, Pantoea dispersa 625, Pantoea rwandensis, Pantoea sp. At-9b, Pantoea sp. CCBC3-3-1, Pantoea sp. PS1, Pantoea sp. SO10, Pantoea stewartii, and Pantoea vagans, suggesting its parasitic role. However, one exception was Pantoea ananatis PA13, which showed mutualism with E. bugandensis, leading to a significant growth advantage for both microorganisms (Fig. 6B). Moreover, in the family Erwiniaceae, microorganisms like Erwinia gerundensis, Mixta calida, and Mixta gaviniae, displayed parasitism, while Mixta theicola displayed amensalistic interactions, favouring growth advantage for E. bugandensis. Escherichia coli also interacted amensalistically with E. bugandensis at Location 1 during Flight 1, leading to its significant growth reduction. Another group of pathogenic species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Klebsiella sp. LY, and Klebsiella variicola, coexisted with E. bugandensis during Flight 1 and 3 in several locations. E. bugandensis exhibited amensalistic interactions with Klebsiella species, leading to a negative growth rate for Klebsiella. Conversely, E. bugandensis displayed parasitism towards K. aerogenes (Fig. 6B). E. bugandensis also displayed positive associations with certain Gram-positive bacteria. Paenibacillus polymyxa, present in Locations 3 and 5 during Flight 2, showed commensalism in the presence of E. bugandensis, resulting in a growth advantage. Additionally, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus exhibited mutualism, while Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 431 displayed commensalism. E. bugandensis demonstrated competitive interaction against closely associated species Enterobacteriaceae bacterium S05 and amensalisitic to Enterobacter cloacae with a negative effect on E. bugandensis. Interestingly, in Location 3 of Flight 1, we observed that several Methylobacterium species interacted with E. bugandensis in a parasitic manner. This facilitated an increased growth for Methylobacterium and subsequently a decreased growth for E. bugandensis (Fig. 5B). Methylobacterium phyllosphaerae had the most significant effect from this interaction. However, a few Methylobacterium species, including Methylobacterium aquaticum, Methylobacterium brachiatum, Methylobacterium durans, and Methylobacterium mesophilicum SR1.6/6, showed commensalistic, mutualistic, mutualistic, and amensalism interactions, respectively. Detailed information on the nature of interactions for all pairs can be found in Supplementary Table 3.Discussion In this study, we discussed the adaptation of a multidrug-resistant, nosocomial BSL-2 pathogen, E. bugandensis, in the unique built environment of the ISS, and its potential succession. Several studies have highlighted the prevalence of microorganisms on ISS surfaces associated with humans, including opportunistic pathogens and discussed the importance of studying them [1, 3]. E. bugandensis, which is also an opportunistic pathogen, was observed to be present in the ISS during the cataloguing of viable microbial communities [1, 19]. Such organisms pose potential threats to astronauts on the ISS, though the exact mechanisms behind their behaviour in space remain unknown. The impact on astronaut health would likely depend on individual health status and how these microorganisms function in extreme space environments. Hence, it is crucial to explore genomic and metabolic studies to understand the functionality of these microorganisms and their potential implications for astronaut well-being. While some attempts have been made to understand the effect of pathogens like A. pittii [25] and K. pneumoniae [13, 26] under stress conditions on the ISS, there is still much more to explore. In this study, we have not limited our analyses to a mere comparison between Earth and ISS isolates of E. bugandensis. Instead, we adopted a unique threefold approach to unravel the potential succession of E. bugandensis in the ISS. Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide analysis to identify the genomic and functionality changes acquired by E. bugandensis during its adaptation to the extreme space environment. Secondly, we quantified the abundance of E. bugandensis in the ISS across multiple flights of the MT-1 mission. Additionally, we looked into the coexisting microbial population of E. bugandensis through a detailed metagenomic analysis. Lastly, we elucidated the metabolic interactions of these organisms and how they contribute to shaping the community structure within the ISS. Through this multi-faceted approach, we were able to explain the survival and dynamics of E. bugandensis in the ISS environment. Recent studies have also indicated the potential role of increased amino acid biosynthesis in the successful colonisation of stressed environments by bacteria such as Salmonella, which is also from the Enterobacteriaceae family [27]. Another operon, astCADBE, known to be involved in arginine and ornithine transport and metabolism, was present in ISS strains and plays a significant role in virulence in enteric pathogens through arginine catabolism [28]. Furthermore, we identified the gene encoding alanine racemase, a key enzyme transforming L-alanine to D-alanine—an essential step in cell wall biosynthesis. Under stress, this enzyme might play a pivotal role in bacterial adaptation and survival by facilitating D-alanine production for cell wall repair and maintenance [29]. Moreover, the higher prevalence of genes in ISS genomes than their Earth counterparts strongly suggests that ISS strains were able to acquire essential accessory genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. This hypothesis is further reinforced by the increased abundance of COGs related to mobilome elements (COG3335, COG3600, COG5545). Further, our analysis revealed the presence of genes associated with SOS response systems, including the LexA repressor and ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH 4. LexA, notably prevalent in ISS but scarce in Earth strains (< 10%), suggests potential selection pressure on E. bugandensis’s DNA damage response, likely induced by the elevated radiation levels and other adversities experienced aboard the ISS. In E. coli and various bacteria, the LexA protein plays a pivotal role in regulating the SOS response to DNA damage, influencing cellular adaptation to stress [30]. We also noted the existence of toxin-antitoxin systems (TAs), which are widely distributed among bacteria and play a critical role in the evolution and propagation of antibiotic resistance, such as the maintenance of multi-resistant plasmids and the induction of persistence [31]. A subset of genes related to type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, including antitoxin components (HigA, SocA, ParD1) and toxin ParE1, participates in plasmid maintenance [32], stress response [33], and biofilm production [31], thereby enhancing bacterial resilience and virulence. Additionally, the presence of the BvgAS two-component regulatory system, typically observed in Bordetella species, is of interest. This system, often referred to as the “master virulence regulator”, controls the activation of virulence genes in various Bordetella species through its components: the histidine kinase BvgS and the response regulator BvgA [34]. Our findings also highlighted the presence of Imm (Colicin-E2 immunity protein), a crucial element providing immunity to colicin E2, which are antimicrobial proteins produced by E. coli under stress conditions as a defence mechanism [35, 36]. Through a comprehensive genome-wide association study, we systematically assessed the identified genes from the pan-genome for their potential links to observed phenotypic traits, considering population stratification. We identified certain genes from our study that are exclusively present in organisms associated with the ISS, but not in their terrestrial counterpart. These include inner membrane protein YbjJ in Bacillus cereus from the ISS [37], transcriptional repressor LexA, and ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH-4 in Acinetobacter pittii from the ISS [25], as well as the bvgAS system in Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34, known for its resilience in harsh environments and also observed in the ISS [38]. These genes could potentially serve as valuable targets for therapeutics against pathogenic microorganisms in the unique environment of the ISS. This analysis demonstrated a distinct association of the identified genes with ISS isolates, further corroborating their relevance to the specific environmental conditions aboard the ISS. The antimicrobial resistance profile is also of interest, mainly due to the fact that ISS strains exhibit distinct phenotypes compared to their Earth-based counterparts yet display similar antimicrobial resistance signatures (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, Singh et al. [19] have indicated a significant increment in antimicrobial-resistant genes during Flight 3 compared to Flights 1 and 2, highlighting the potential persistence of opportunistic pathogens in Flight 3 samples, which is also shown in our study. We have identified multiple MDR gene classes (14 in total) within the ISS strains. Among these, the presence of ACT (AmpC-type cephalosporinase) β-lactamase genes is interesting. Although previous studies have reported the presence of blaCTX-M-55, blaNDM-5, and blaIMI-1 in the broader E. bugandensis population [39], our analysis did not reveal these specific genes within the ISS strains. Additionally, we identified the vanG gene, typically associated with Vancomycin Resistance Locus primarily observed in Enterococcus faecalis [40]. Another finding was the presence of KpnEF, a cell envelope stress response regulon, and an SMR-type efflux pump associated with broad-spectrum antimicrobial resistance, commonly observed in K. pneumoniae [41]. Considering the close genetic proximity to Earth strains, especially hospital isolates like AR1358, these MDR genes and associated mechanisms raise concerns. These genetic elements are likely acquired by E. bugandensis through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events, potentially contributing to their MDR capabilities. Next, we set out to estimate the abundance of E. bugandensis in the ISS metagenomic samples. Our findings revealed that E. bugandensis exhibits prevalence and varying relative abundance across different locations within the space station. There were no significant differences in the absolute abundance of E. bugandensis between PMA- and non-PMA-treated samples, suggesting that the DNA retrieved from this opportunistic pathogen residing on ISS is viable and intact. E. bugandensis was found to be persistent across the ARED (Location 3) and the Zero-G Stowage Rack (ZSR; Location 5) throughout all three flights of the MT-1 mission (Fig. 5). Despite its presence in all locations, the relative abundance of E. bugandensis was generally low, except for a substantial burden observed at Location 2 during Flight 1 (Supplementary Table 2). These observations further motivated us to examine the associated microbiota co-existing with E. bugandensis on the ISS. Our analysis found that E. bugandensis coexists with a group of Pantoea species at multiple locations across all flights, particularly in the ZSR (Location 5). Although both Enterobacter and Pantoea belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae, they exhibit high diversity [42] and have been reported to coexist in other environments, including hospital ICUs [43] and sugarcane tissues [44]. E. bugandensis also interacted with several Klebsiella species within the same family Enterobacteriaceae, mainly at the Cupola (Flight 1) and ARED (Flight 3). E. bugandensis is a common human commensal [45, 46] but can act as an opportunistic pathogen, co-infecting immunocompromised individuals (e.g. COVID-infected patients) [47], and have the ability to transfer plasmids through HGT events [48, 49]. Studies have also demonstrated the co-presence of Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Paenibacillus, and Pantoea as bacterial endophytes in cereals and Enterobacter sp., Mixta sp., and Pantoea sp. in germinating seeds [50]. To further explore and quantify their interaction patterns, we employed two widely applied computational approaches: (i) graph-theoretical approach to estimate metabolic dependencies and (ii) constraint-based modelling to examine the nature of their interactions. Our study, while informative, does come with certain limitations. In our comprehensive genomic exploration of E. bugandensis, we uncovered genes linked to the ISS environment. Firstly, the limited number of E. bugandensis genomes collected from the ISS, in comparison to Earth isolates, may impact the robustness of our genomic findings. One challenge we encountered was the presence of numerous genes with inadequate annotations, many of which were hypothetical proteins. A comparative study by Lobb et al. [48] reported that Prokka, a widely used annotation tool, demonstrated a mean proteome annotation coverage of 52 ± 9%. However, it is essential to note that Prokka’s functional annotation parameters are stringent, relying solely on reference proteins with experimental evidence for functional assignments. Moreover, while our study strongly suggests adaptation and a “potential” succession of E. bugandensis in the ISS environment, we acknowledge that true succession assessment would ideally involve techniques such as qPCR or ecological-scale analyses. However, we strengthened our hypothesis for the likelihood of adaptation based on multiple converging analyses employing diverse approaches. Furthermore, the metabolic models we constructed are draft models generated from representative type strains of the organisms. Although we employed default gap-filling options using ModelSEED, these models may still have gaps and could differ from the actual isolates. Despite these limitations, such automated reconstruction models are widely used for studying metabolic characteristics and predicting microbial interactions [51]. Also, our models were simulated under minimal medium conditions along with specific cofactors, thereby representing environmental communities with limited rich medium contents. Although some microbial interactions might remain stable in various nutrient-rich settings, others may vary based on the distinct metabolic capacities of the interacting pairs. While exploring microbial interactions in extreme communities, we employed a graph-based approach for exploring the metabolic dependencies among the members. Our findings suggested that Gram-positive organisms (e.g. Staphylococcus) often rely on metabolic support from Gram-negative counterparts such as Enterobacter, Pantoea, and Klebsiella genera. Moreover, studies from the ISS surface microbiome of the US module as well as the Japan module have shown that microorganisms belonging to the family Staphylococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were the most dominant organisms on ISS surfaces [1, 52]. Focusing on E. bugandensis, we observed that it receives limited metabolic support from coexisting microorganisms, suggesting its positioning as a higher-level contributor within the community’s food chain. In contrast, most community members appear to derive some form of metabolic support from E. bugandensis, albeit nominal in most instances. This finding is consistent with recent research indicating the significance of Enterobacteriaceae in facilitating beneficial interactions among microorganisms, whereas families like Erwiniaceae and Staphylococcaceae contributed less to metabolic support [13]. However, these interactions provide a static snapshot of metabolic interaction potential and do not really capture the nature of interactions. Thus, we introduced a complementary constraint-based method to predict the nature of interactions based on growth rates. This combined approach offers a more comprehensive view of microbial interactions. Our investigation extended to the specific impact of E. bugandensis on other microorganisms. We elucidated possible effects on plant-associated microbes, such as Pantoea and Methylobacterium, suggesting a potential overlap in resource utilisation for growth (Fig. 6B). The prevalence of Methylobacterium across the ISS, known for its resilience in challenging environments, underscores its adaptability to extreme conditions from NASA spacecraft assembly clean rooms [53] to hospital intensive care units (ICUs) [54]. Additionally, our study highlighted the reciprocal influence between E. bugandensis and Klebsiella species, suggesting a potential reduction in the growth rate for Klebsiella (Fig. 6B). A recent study indicated the interaction between Enterobacter species and clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and their implications for antibiotic resistance patterns [55]. This study also illustrated how the presence of E. bugandensis influences Gram-positive organisms (Fig. 6B). Nevertheless, while our metabolic modelling approach predicts antagonistic and parasitic behaviours, further experimentation is required to validate these predictions against other opportunistic microbial pathogens.Conclusion In this study, we presented a robust and comprehensive methodology to decipher the survival mechanisms of the clinically significant microorganism, E. bugandensis, within the challenging environment of the ISS. Through a synergistic integration of genomics, metagenomics, and metabolic modelling, we unravelled the potential strategies employed by E. bugandensis for adaptation and persistence in the unique ISS ecosystem. Our approach holds promise for broader applications, especially in terrestrial controlled settings such as hospital ICUs and surgical theatres. Ultimately, our findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of microbial dynamics in extreme environments, laying a solid foundation for future hypotheses and expanding the horizons of microbial ecology research.Methods Collection and classification of E. bugandensis genomes In this study, we utilised publicly available annotated genomes of E. bugandensis ( taxonomic ID 881260) from the  GenBank sequence database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/, accessed on July 17, 2023) using command line tools  Entrez Direct (EDirect) and bit [56]. We downloaded 211 genomes, including 12 genomes of ISS strains and one MAG generated from the metagenome during the Microbial Tracking-1 mission. To identify the source of these isolates, we manually explored the  BioSample database and classified them into four consistent categories—Human, Non-human/ Environmental, ISS, and Unknown isolates. To ensure taxonomic identification and relatedness of the genomes, we employed the FastANI v.1.33 tool to calculate pairwise ANI for each downloaded genome [57]. The reference strain used for ANI calculation was the E. bugandensis type-strain EB-247T ( assembly ID GCF_900324475.1, available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMEA104711314/), which was originally isolated from the neonatal blood of a patient in Tanzania [14].Phylogeny and SNP identification We used the Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based command-line tool, GToTree v.1.6.31 [58], to construct the phylogenetic tree of the E. bugandensis genomes. The tree was built at strain level using the single-copy gene (SCG)-set HMM of Gammaproteobacteria targeting 172 marker genes. We subsequently employed interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) v.6.7 [59] for visualisation and annotation of the tree. We excluded strain e1342 ( assembly ID GCF_900075565.1) from our further analyses, as it appeared as an outlier in the phylogenetic tree. For the ISS strains and its close Earth-bound isolates (as shown in Fig. 2, we computed the SNPs through a core-SNP set using Snippy v.4.6.0 (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) by mapping assembled contigs to annotated type-strain. Snippy uses Burrows-Wheelers Aligner and SAMtools v.1.3.1 for alignment and FreeBayes to identify variants across the provided genomes. We further ran Gubbins v.3.2.1 for recombination-removal and FastTree v.2.1.11 with the generalised time-reversible (GTR) model for tree-building on the output from Snippy to produce the phylogenetic tree shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A.Identifying ISS-associated genomic features of E. bugandensis To identify and annotate the ORFs in the genomes of E. bugandensis, we utilised Prokka v.1.14.6, which employs Prodigal for gene prediction [60]. Prokka’s standard automated pipeline annotated the genomes based on multiple reference databases. We employed the Python package cogclassifier v.1.0.5 (https://pypi.org/project/cogclassifier/) to identify and classify COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Genes) from the Prokka annotated genomes. We applied the graph-based algorithm Panaroo v.1.3.2 in strict mode, employing specific parameters (including a sequence identity threshold of 0.7, a core genome sample threshold of 0.95, no paralog splitting, and the “Clustal” aligner) and constructed a pan-genome [61]. Subsequently, we used IQTREE v.2.2.27 on the Panaroo core alignment output, with the GTR+G model in fast mode, to build an alternative phylogenetic tree [62]. For gene-level genome-wide association analysis, we employed Scoary v.1.6.16, using the gene presence-absence matrix generated by Panaroo [63]. This analysis enabled us to identify associations between all genes in the accessory genome and the traits of interest. To identify the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and markers in the isolated genomes and MAGs of E. bugandensis from the ISS, we employed the Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) v.6.0.2, a command line tool using the CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) v.3.2.6 [22]. Matches were restricted to “Perfect” and “Strict” matches only, ensuring high confidence in the identified antibiotic resistance genes and markers.Presence of E. bugandensis and co-existing species in ISS metagenomic samples We downloaded the 42 paired-end metagenomics reads of the environmental samples from ISS during the MT-1 mission from  Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with the project accession PRJNA438545 [19]. The metadata for all the samples, including the run ID, sample size, and sample name, is available in Supplementary Table 2. We used the MetaSUB Core Analysis Modular Pipeline (CAMP) (https://github.com/MetaSUB-CAMP) to preprocess the samples and predict the taxonomic profiles of the metagenomic samples. Within the CAMP pipeline, the quality of the reads was assessed using FastQC v.0.12.0, following which low-quality reads were filtered out using fastp v.0.22.0 and adapter sequences were removed using AdapterRemoval v.2.3.3. Subsequently, host reads were removed after aligning it to the human genome (GRCh38, without alternate contigs) using Bowtie2 v.2.4.5. Sequencing errors were corrected using Tadpole v.8.22. We further employed the CAMP short-read taxonomy pipeline to generate taxonomical classification and relative abundance data for all metagenomic samples with non-human reads. The pipeline uses BBMask within BBMap v.35.85 to mask the metagenomes to prevent false positives in low-complexity or highly conserved regions in bacterial genomes. We then ran Kraken2 v.2.1.2, with a read length cut-off of 150, to classify reads and determine the closest matching species. We used Bracken v.2.7 on the output of Kraken2 to estimate the relative abundance of species in each sample.Reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic models To gain insights into the microbial interactions of E. bugandensis in the ISS, our primary focus was on identifying the viable microbiome associated with this bacterium. To achieve this, we analysed samples treated exclusively with propidium monoazide (PMA), which retains only viable and intact cells. For our analysis, we specifically considered only those samples containing E. bugandensis. Additionally, we limited our study to bacteria that coexist with E. bugandensis, having a relative abundance of > 1% among all bacteria present at the respective location. We obtained representative genome sequences of the co-existing bacteria from the GenBank sequence database. To construct the Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs), these genomes were processed through KBase (https://www.kbase.us/). The bacterial genomes were initially annotated using the RASTtk toolkit v1.073 [64]. Subsequently, the Build Metabolic Model v.2.0.0 app was used to reconstruct the models based on the ModelSEED pipeline [65]. Appropriate templates, such as Gram-positive or Gram-negative, were selected for the reconstruction process. We further gap-filled the models using RefGlucoseMinimal medium from the KBase public media database, with a maximum uptake of Glucose to 10 mmol/gDW-h. These resulting models were then utilised for both graph-theoretic and constraint-based analyses.Exploring the metabolic interactions of E. bugandensis in ISS We simulated genome-scale models using a comprehensive set of metabolites believed to be necessary for the growth of the microbial community aboard the ISS. This metabolite set combines the minimal medium of each metabolic model with essential cofactors and coenzymes, as reported previously [13]. To determine the minimal media for microbial communities, we employed the minimal_media_from_cobrapy function from MetQuest v.2.0, which ensures the necessary components for a minimum growth rate of 0.1 h-1 of all members in the community [66]. We further used MetQuest v.2.0 for constructing bipartite graphs that represent the metabolic framework of microorganisms. These graphs represent the interplay of reactions within the microbial community and helped us identify active and stuck reactions for the given set of metabolites using a guided breadth-first search approach. The extent of metabolic benefit for each pair in the community was measured using the Metabolic Support Index (MSI) according to the following equation: MSIA|AB=1-nstuckA|ABnstuckA 1 Here, nstuckA and nstuckA|AB are the numbers of stuck reactions in the wild-type and pair-wise community structures. The metabolic dependencies were quantified based on the number of stuck reactions that were relieved by the developed community networks. To predict the nature of microbial interactions, we employed SteadyCom, an optimisation framework for rapid linear programming problem-solving. This framework allowed us to estimate the biomass production rates of every microbial member in the community in a time-averaged, steady-state manner [24]. The pairwise effect of microbes in any given community was expressed through the equation: Effect of A on B=vbio,AB-vbio,Bvbio,B 2 Here, vbio,B and vbio,AB are the biomass production rate of the organism B (wild-type) and the community (AB), respectively. For SteadyCom simulation, the same media as before was used, with a constrained uptake rate of −10 mmol/gDW-h. We considered a significant change in growth when there was a 10% difference in the growth rate of an organism within the community compared to its individual growth rate. Based on the calculated values from the equation (i.e. the effect of A on B and the effect of B on A), we classified microbial interactions into six broad types: mutualism (+,+), parasitism (+,−), commensalism (+,0 or 0,+), amensalism (−,0 or 0,−), competition (−,−), and neutral (0,0).Supplementary information 40168_2024_1777_MOESM1_ESM.jpg (2.5MB, jpg) Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values, when compared to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for all species described here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (= NRRL B-65660T = DSM 115933T), Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (= NRRL B-65661T = DSM 115931T), Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT (= NRRL B-65662T = DSM 115932T), Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (= NRRL B-65663T = DSM 115940T), and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (= NRRL B-65664T = DSM 115943T). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions.

    "introduction": "Introduction Multiple low-Earth orbit and lunar orbit space habitats are being planned by governmental and commercial entities as part of the newly revitalized space industry in the 2020s. Cleaning practices and microbial monitoring to ensure crew safety will likely be based on information garnered from studies of the International Space Station (ISS), which is the only space habitat currently in orbit with a long-term history of human habitation. Surfaces of the crew resupply vehicles1 and cargo destined to the ISS are cleaned to minimize microbial contamination and protect crew health. Nevertheless, the constant presence of human crew members (approximately six at any given time) on the ISS may lead to the shedding of microorganisms onto its surfaces, potentially causing recontamination and becoming dominant members of the habitat’s microbiome2. As a result, ISS surfaces are required to be routinely (once a week) cleaned to maintain a low biomass level (< 104 CFU/100 cm2 bacteria and < 100 CFU/100 cm2 fungi)3. Despite this rigorous cleaning and maintenance, it has been reported that some resilient microbes, albeit in low numbers, have adapted to microgravity conditions and persist4. Examples are the discovery of a novel bacterial genus found repeatedly in metagenomes, which has subsequently been isolated from ISS surfaces during further sampling campaigns5, and the isolation of the same clonal strains of Acinetobacter pittii from ISS surfaces during different years and sampling campaigns6. Characterizing the genomes and adaptation mechanisms of rare or novel species that manage to recolonize ISS surfaces is important because rare species are more likely to have narrow niche breadth, and so are persisting due to adaptive mechanisms to the stresses of radiation, desiccation, and microgravity conditions rather than via generalist strategies. Such microbes are therefore also fertile grounds for biotechnology applications research. Characterizing novel microbial species on the ISS is crucial for monitoring microbial contamination and protecting astronaut health. The process of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species found on the ISS helps to identify potential pathogens, as well as to understand potential impact on the spacecraft and its equipment (for example, in biofouling). Easily detecting or identifying a potential microbial threat, whether it be to human health or to the operation of the spacecraft or space station, depends on having an up-to-date, comprehensive database of microbial genomes, their species identity and their phenotypic characteristics (for example, are they known to carry or easily acquire antimicrobial resistance genes, are they UV resistant, what types of surfaces are they more likely to be found on, etc.). This is particularly the case when genetic information about a microbial threat is collected via shotgun metagenomic sequencing rather than by whole genome sequencing of pure culture; in that case, accurate identification relies entirely on an accurate database. The process of characterizing the previously unsequenced cultivable microbiome of space habitats continues to reduce the amount of microbial ‘dark matter’ found in metagenomic sequencing results. In the ongoing Microbial Tracking (MT) investigation of the ISS7,8, out of 510 genomes sequenced, 56 microbial species have been isolated multiple times, representing 27 microbial genera (19 bacteria and 8 fungi). Dominant microbial species include bacterial genera Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Acinetobacter, yeast genus Rhodotorula, and fungal genera Penicillium, Aureobasidium, and Aspergillus9–25. In this communication, six strains isolated from various ISS environmental surfaces belonging to five novel bacterial species constituting four different genera (Arthrobacter, Leifsonia, Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina) are described. Since recent bacterial taxonomy heavily depends on genomic characterization, WGS of these novel species were generated and compared with publicly available genomes of closely related species. One of the objectives of this study was to establish these six strains as novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, physiological, and phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes) analyses were carried out. To discover the phylogenetic placement within their respective genera, we have employed multiple gene analyses and WGS-based phylogenies containing all shared single-copy core genes. The second objective was to quantify the abundance of these recently identified species in the metagenomes of ISS surfaces. Hence, an in-depth analysis was conducted on the metagenomes collected during seven different flight missions, consisting of 106 individual samples, to assess the presence and prevalence of the species. In addition, an attempt was made to generate metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) of these novel species from the ISS metagenomes. Finally, antiSMASH analysis was performed to identify, annotate, and analyze secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) in the genomes of these novel bacterial species. Specialized metabolites and natural products encoded by these novel bacterial BGCs might provide insight into how different bacterial species thrive and interact in ISS conditions.",

    "results": "Results The six strains isolated during this study belonged to five novel species spanning four bacterial genera. Among the six strains, four were non-spore-forming members and two strains formed endospores. Based on 16S rRNA gene similarities, not all strains were identified into a novel bacterial species, but ANI/dDDH analyses allowed them to be placed into five distinct bacterial species. They were: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT, Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT, Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T. In addition, the WGS of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was generated and compared with the genome of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T to identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits. Genome characteristics and relatedness indices Table 1 summarizes the assembly statistics for all six strains. The draft genomes of the novel bacterial species were assembled using high-quality sequences, and their assembly quality varied from a single contig to 49 scaffolds. The non-spore-forming strains had high GC contents, ranging from 68% to 71.4%, whereas spore-forming strains, such as P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (46.1%) and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (41.6%), had low GC content. The total number of predicted genes was 2166 for S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T and 4861 for P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. However, the non-spore-forming bacterial species had ~ 3444 to 3850 coding regions (Table 1). In addition to the novel species, the complete genome of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was generated and compared to S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T strain since both shared > 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities.

Phylogeny The comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences of A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, isolated from the air particles collected from ARED during Flight 2, revealed a high similarity (> 99.6%) to most established Arthrobacter species. This suggests that the 16S rRNA gene may not be an adequate marker for distinguishing members within this genus. However, upon analyzing the gyrB gene sequences of this phylogenetic clade, the similarity values were found to be below 85.9%. Furthermore, strain IIF3SC-B10T displayed low values for digital dDDH (24.5%) and ANI indices (82.9%). These findings provide additional evidence supporting its classification as a novel species. In the 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree encompassing all Arthrobacter species (Fig. 1A), with Micrococcus antarcticus as the outgroup, strain IIF3SC-B10T clustered together with officially named species such as A. agilis, A. cheniae, A. bussei, and A. antioxidans (Fig. 1A). However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 1B), constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 59 genomes containing 138 single-copy core genes common to all Actinobacteria, A. burdickii was found to be distinct from the A. ruber and A. cheniae clades. Instead, it exhibited closer similarity to the unrecognized species A. sedimenti (ANI 93.8%). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Arthrobacter species including strain IIF3SC-B10T based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 138 single-copy core genes of phylum Actinobacteria, keeping Kocuria rhizophila as an outgroup.The 16S rRNA gene sequences of L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT, isolated from crew quarters in Flight 6, exhibited > 98.9% similarity to L. soli and L. shinshuensis, indicating that the 16S rRNA gene is not a suitable marker for distinguishing members of this genus. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences of the members of this phylogenetic clade, the similarity values were below 91.7%. However, the strain F6_8S_P_1AT exhibited low dDDH values (< 28.3%) and ANI indices (86.3%), providing further evidence that it belongs to a novel species. In the 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree of all Leifsonia species, with Rathayibacter tritici as the outgroup, strain F6_8S_P_1AT was placed within a clade that also included the validly described species L. aquatica, L. xyli, L. lichenia, L. shinshuensis, and L. soli (Fig. 2A). However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 2B), which was constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters of eight available genomes containing a total of 138 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Actinobacteria, L. virtsii was separated from all these Leifsonia species. The next closest member was L. soli (ANI 86.3%). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Leifsonia species including strains F6_8S_P_1AT, F6_8S_P_1BT and F6_8S_P_1C based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 138 single-copy core genes of phylum Actinobacteria, keeping Nocardia fluminea as an outgroup.In addition to L. virtsii, two strains were identified as L. williamsii based on their gyrB sequence similarity (91.6%), ANI index (84.3%), and dDDH value (24.7%), which were below the species threshold level. Surprisingly, despite the high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between L. virtsii and L. williamsii (99.2%), the 16S rRNA gene tree (Fig. 2A) placed them in different clades, supported by 88% bootstrap values. Notably, the L. williamsii strains were isolated from the same crew quarter location as L. virtsii, and they even originated from the same culture plate of R2A medium. Initially, there was a suspicion that they might be clones from the same colony, but further analysis using WGS and gyrB sequencing confirmed that they were distinct novel species. In contrast to the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, the WGS-based tree (Fig. 2B) clearly differentiated L. williamsii from L. virtsii. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, isolated from the ARED’s surface during Flight 6, exhibited 99.5% similarity to P. pabuli, indicating that the 16S rRNA gene is not a suitable marker for distinguishing members of this genus. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences, P. pabuli also exhibited 94.9% similarity with P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. Since it was established that ~ 95% gyrB as cut-off value for species delineation, WGS was performed which showed that ANI index was only 88.4%. Based on low ANI index and dDDH value (34.6%), P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT is differentiated from P. pabuli and described as a novel species. The 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny (Fig. 3A) showed that P. xylanivrans, P. taichungensis, and P. paubli formed a tight clade with > 99% similarities among them. However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 3B), which was constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 244 genomes containing a total of 119 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Firmicutes, P. vandeheii was separated from all these Paenibacillus species and was found to be closer to the P. xylanivorans (ANI 92.8%). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Paenibacillus species including strain F6_3S_P_1CT based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 119 single-copy core genes of phylum Firmicutes, keeping Bacillus subtilis as an outgroup.The strain F6_3S_P_2T, another spore-forming bacterium belonging to the genus Sporosarcina and isolated from the ARED surface during Flight 6, displayed a 99.8% similarity to S. thermotolerans based on the 16S rRNA gene. This finding highlights the difficulty in classifying spore-forming microorganisms using the 16S rRNA gene marker. Hence, the WGS of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was needed to identify the phylogenetic position of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences, S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T exhibited an 87.0% similarity with S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T. Furthermore, the ANI index between the genomes of F6_3S_P_2T and S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was only 85.3%. Considering the low ANI index and dDDH value (29.8%), S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T can be identified as a novel species, distinct from S. thermotolerans. In the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny (Fig. 4A), S. thermotolerans, S. luteola, and S. saromensis formed a closely related clade with > 99% similarities among them. However, S. koreensis did not cluster within this clade, despite having a 16S rRNA gene similarity with S. highlanderae. On the other hand, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 4B), constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 15 genomes containing 119 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Firmicutes, S. highlanderae was separated from all other Sporosarcina species. Instead, it exhibited closer similarity to S. thermotolerans (ANI 85.3%). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Sporosarcina species including strain F6_3S_P_2T and Sporosarcina thermotolerans CCUG 53480T based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 119 single-copy core genes of phylum Firmicutes, keeping Paenibacillus polymyxa as an outgroup. Phenotypic characterization The cell size (Fig. 5), colony morphology, biochemical characteristics based on Vitek-2 (Supplemental Table S1) and BioLog GNIII (Supplemental Table S2), fatty acid profiles (Supplemental Table S3) and chemotaxonomic features (Supplemental Figure S1) of all five novel species are presented. A. burdickii can be phenotypically differentiated from other closely related Arthrobacter species since maltose, trehalose, cellobiose, turanose, and acetoacetic acid were not utilized as sole carbon substrate (Table 3). The Leifsonia species did not show any specific phenotypic characteristics that could be used to differentiate them from other closely related Leifsonia species; hence, molecular phylogeny is essential (Table 4). P. vandeheii was able to grow at 8% NaCl which can be used as discriminative test. Oxidase test was also positive whereas P. tundrae, P. xylanexedens, and P. amylolitus were negative. In addition, P. vandeheii can be differentiated by the utilization of Tween 40, turanose, γ-hydroxybutyric acid, l-malic acid, and l-serine as sole carbon source from P. taichungensis and P. paubli which are negative (Table 5). S. highlanderae could grow at 4% NaCl only, but S. thermotolerans, S. luteola, and S. saromensis were able to withstand > 7.5% to 10% NaCl concentration (Table 6). Figure 5.

Additionally, A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T was found to possess a significant amount of an unidentified phospholipid (PL1), a characteristic that sets it apart from Leifsonia species. P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited a complex polar lipid profile, which included phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, two unidentified phospholipids and an unidentified aminophospholipid. On the other hand, S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T was found to contain phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine two unidentified phospholipids and an identified lipid. The polar lipid profiles of new species are in excellent agreement with the data published earlier for Arthrobacter55, Leifsonia56, Paenibacillus57,58, and Sporosarcina59. Based on this polyphasic taxonomy, the five novel species are described, and their detailed phenotypic, FAME profile, chemotaxonomic, and molecular characteristics are given below.

Abundance of novel species in ISS metagenomes We conducted an analysis of metagenomic reads obtained from two microbial tracking (MT) missions, encompassing seven flights across eight locations on the ISS, with the objective of identifying novel microbial species and potentially retrieving MAGs. To assess the presence of viable and intact cells of the novel species, we utilized propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment on the samples as previously described7,8. Our findings revealed that the majority of the metagenomes had less than 0.1% of their total reads mapped to the novel species. Among all the species analyzed, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited the highest mapping, with a maximum of 1.05% of total reads from a sample collected during Flight 2 near the port crew quarters (location 8) during MT-1. Therefore, we can conclude that none of these novel species are dominant in the ISS. Considering the limited proportion of reads mapped to the novel species, we proceeded to perform read assembly to explore the breadth of coverage against the isolated genomes. Interestingly, reads mapped to L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT and L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT from Flight 6 at location 8 exhibited a breadth of coverage of 59.4% and 80.7% respectively, despite representing a small fraction of the total reads (Fig. 6). However, apart from these cases, the overall breadth of coverage for the genomes was quite low, averaging at 0.21% hence, no MAG was generated. We also analyzed the PMA untreated samples and observed the similar pattern in the distribution of the breadth of coverages. Additionally, we noticed 84.4% breadth of coverage for L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT during Flight 7 at location 8 from where the strain was isolated. Despite the presence of a high breadth of coverage for Leifsonia genomes across multiple samples, we were unable to obtain MAGs due to the failure of achieving the minimum coverage depth threshold of 4X. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Box plots showing breadth of coverage of the consensus genome constructed from mapped reads aligned to the novel species (percent coverage was less than 1% in all cases). Due to high variations in the breadth of coverages of Leifsonia genomes, a broken Y-axis was used. The reads were collected from eight locations on the ISS across seven separate time points/flights as part of the Microbial Tracking project(s). Functional characterization of the novel species To investigate the genetic characteristics of the six novel strains, we performed a comprehensive genome annotation using RAST-tk (Table 7; Supplemental Table S4). The subsystem mapping results are as follows: A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (283 subsystems), L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (273 subsystems), L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT (262 subsystems), L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1CT (262 subsystems), P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (324 subsystems), and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (307 subsystems). Among the annotated subsystems, the top categories based on average gene counts included amino acids and derivatives (260 genes), carbohydrate metabolism (232 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (136 genes), and protein metabolism (171 genes).

Two mechanisms were predicted as the primarily function of these genes: resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and invasion and intracellular resistance. A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, in particular, is the only species that harbors the sarcosine oxidase (EC 1.5.3.1) gene, which is involved in the osmotic stress response. On the other hand, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T, both belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, possess a specific mechanism to respond to bacitracin-induced stress through the bceABRS four-component system. Notably, these two species also possess additional stress response mechanisms for periplasmic stress via the intramembrane protease RasP/YluC. While exploring other factors, it was observed that A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T does not possess any genes associated with motility. However, the other novel species have genes related to motility, including flagellar biosynthesis proteins. Among all the species, only P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT has the chemotaxis subsystem. We conducted further investigations into the metabolic potential of these novel species and made some noteworthy observations. A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T was found to possess a significantly higher number of genes related to aromatic compound metabolism, while having fewer genes associated with iron metabolism compared to the other species characterized in this study. With the exception of P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, all the other species exhibited the capability to perform polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism. However, only P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, due to the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2), can utilize glutathione as a sulfur source. Considering the concerns regarding spore-forming bacteria and their resistance to sterilization processes in the ISS, we further explored the spore-forming capabilities of these novel species. As expected, a significant number of genes associated with dormancy and sporulation were predicted in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T genomes. Between them, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited the highest number of 40 genes, primarily associated with spore germination and spore maturation processes. In contrast, the other species are non-spore forming and do not possess specific proteins associated with sporulation. Antimicrobial resistance properties of the novel species In the isolated five novel species, we searched for antibiotic resistance genes against the CARD database60 and calculated the percentage identity with the reference sequences. Overall, these genomes showed potential resistance to seven drug classes, including rifamycin and tetracycline antibiotics. Interestingly, we found that all of these genomes contained genes from vancomycin resistance gene clusters with an identity ranging from 30.7% to 51.5%. Among other identified resistance genes, we discovered the presence of rifampicin monooxygenase (RIFMO) in Leifsonia species with a 63% match, which catalyzes the inactivation of the antibiotic rifampicin. In P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, we identified a set of markers, including Llm 23S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase (LlmA_23S_CLI) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), which exhibited high sequence identities of 84.67% and 87.91%, respectively. LlmA_23S_CLI was originally detected in Paenibacillus sp. LC231, a strain isolated from Lechuguilla Cave, NM, USA61. Additionally, strain F6_3S_P_1CT was found to possess two genes, qacG and qacJ, which are part of a small multidrug resistance efflux pump conferring resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). Furthermore, in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T, we identified the presence of tetracycline-resistant ribosomal protection genes tetB(P) and tet(Q), respectively, with approximately 30% similarity. These provide resistance by preventing the binding of the antibiotic tetracycline to the bacterial ribosome. Moreover, these genomes also encode orthologues of the antibiotic-inactivating enzyme fosfomycin thiol transferase. The genomic mining predicted the presence of AMR genes but the confirmation of the phenotypic resistance requires further investigation. Production of secondary metabolites To explore the potential for producing secondary metabolites in the newly discovered species, we utilized antiSMASH, a bioinformatics tool for predicting putative BGCs. This analysis revealed a total of 16 cluster types, including βlactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters (Table 8). In A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, we identified a moderately matched thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161, known for its effectiveness against multidrug-resistant Gram-stain-positive bacteria and fungi62. Furthermore, in the isolated Leifsonia species, we found two well-known gene clusters: T3PKS-alkylresorcinol and NAPAA (non-α poly-amino acids) ε-Poly-l-lysine (ε-PL), both with a 100% match. Among the analyzed species, Leifsonia species shared a partially matched carotenoid BGC with P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. However, several unique cluster types, including cyclic-lactone-autoinducer, lanthipeptide, lassopeptide, NRP-metallophore, opine-like-metallophore, and proteusin, were identified exclusively in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. Notably, within the F6_3S_P_1CT strain, we also identified BGCs paeninodin (60%) and bacillopaline (100%). Lastly, S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T exhibited one phosphonate, one T3PKS, and one terpene BGC, although these clusters have not yet been fully characterized. Table 8.

    "discussion": "Discussion New launch technology and new investment in human exploration of space by governments and private industry are leading to a revitalization of the idea of long-term space habitation. Missions to the moon are already underway, and missions to Mars are planned for the near future. Such missions will be measured in multiple years rather than in months and will have no or little resupply from Earth. In such cases, the microbiome of the space vessel or habitat will need to be monitored for multiple reasons: the spread of pathogens through the air or on surfaces which could infect humans63 or plants64 as well as the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes65, the health of human commensal microbiomes (and potential overgrowth of secondary pathogens), and the potential for biofouling of fluid lines or water supplies via microbial overgrowth66. Also, with no resupply from Earth there is no ability to gain access to Earth’s massive microbial biodiversity. Unless specific microbes are stocked as supplies before launch1, the microbes found on the spacecraft or habitat are the only ones which could be used for the many commercial purposes that microbes are used for on Earth: antibiotic or therapeutic discovery, manufacturing of drugs, food, and vitamins, plant growth enhancement, probiotics, etc. Biological in-situ resource utilization may also require bioremediation or bioconversion of raw, potentially toxic materials collected from moons, other planets, or asteroids/comets. Whether or not the microbiome of a space habitat can be controlled and repurposed to this extent depends on a number of factors, including (1) whether the microbial diversity of such a space habitat would be sufficient to include all the traits desired for the many purposes listed above, (2) accurate detection and identification of already-known microbes and taxonomic placement of unidentified microbes, including whether shotgun metagenomic sequencing would detect the presence of problematic microbes from low biomass surfaces, and (3) characterization of potential phenotypic traits based on genomic predictions. Like the proverbial mustard seed, perhaps we inadvertently carry a planet’s worth of microbial diversity wherever we travel. The novel microbes described herein are not necessarily any more noteworthy than those which might be isolated from an office building on Earth [though they are likely far more resilient given the harsh conditions67 of the space environment], and yet each hosts significant potential for affecting human health5 or for use in assisting plant growth68, bioremediation or manufacturing, and offers a glimpse into the genetic and metabolic potential of the microbial diversity of the ISS69. The most abundant cultivable microbes on ISS surfaces include common, well-studied human commensals such as Staphylococcus, Rhodotorula, Penicillium, and Micrococcus species. However, there are many more that have only been isolated once aboard the ISS and which are at very low abundance—potentially shed from individual astronauts, from experiments such as plant grow-ins, from new pieces of cargo, or from the vast microbial diversity of the human gut—which can be considered a part of the rare microbiome. Although individually rare, members of this community collectively play significant roles in ecosystem functioning and stability, including functional redundancy which enhances the resilience and stability of ecosystems by ensuring that multiple microbial species can perform essential ecological functions, such as nutrient cycling, decomposition, and symbiotic interactions. The novel bacterial species described during this study belong to rare microbial species since their incidence in the shotgun metagenomes was very low, and only the two Leifsonia species had sufficiently high breadth of coverage of mapped metagenomic reads from the ISS crew quarters to have been definitively identified using shotgun metagenomic sequencing without culturing as well. Previous to using a WGS approach, the diversity of the ISS cultivable microbiome was significantly underestimated due to reliance on only 16S-based taxonomic identification. However, for many bacterial genera, 16S rRNA gene sequencing strategy fails to differentiate new species with significantly different phenotypic traits. For instance, there is 99.8% similarity between the 16S rRNA genes of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T and S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T, with a mere 3 base pair substitutions. Without access to the whole genome, S. highlanderae would be categorized as S. thermotolerans, even though it is not a thermophile. Upon accessing all 93 Sporosarcina genomes from the  database and generating an ANI heatmap (Supplemental Figure S2), it was evident that this clade contains at least five novel genera and 56 species which are yet to be described. This inference was based on ANI values of less than 70% for 14 Sporosarcina genomes, encompassing S. highlanderae, S. thermotolerans, and S. luteola and further emphasizes that the 16S rRNA gene on its own is not a reliable tool for differentiating among members of the Sporosarcina genus. Placing these 93 genomes into their phylogenetic affiliation require more study. Upon examining 337 ISS bacterial genomes (plus six novel strains) belonging to 36 bacterial species (plus five novel species), it was observed that non-dominant, rare, and phylogenetically undescribed species predicted to produce natural products. As their genetic and phenotypic potential remains uncharacterized, exploration of the rare microbiome can lead to the discovery of novel bioactive compounds, enzymes, and metabolic pathways. Many of these rare microorganisms have untapped biotechnological potential, with applications in fields such as medicine, agriculture, industry, and environmental remediation. Studying the rare microbiome can uncover valuable resources for the development of new biotechnological tools and processes. In the case of A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, we identified a moderately matched thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161, known for its efficacy against multidrug-resistant Gram-stain-positive bacteria and fungi62. Leifsonia species contain alkylresorcinol, which exhibits various activities including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and genotoxicity effects70. Additionally, alkylresorcinol plays a role in bacterial cyst formation during unfavorable environmental conditions71. On the other hand, ε-PL is responsible for antimicrobial activity against food spoilage and food-poisoning bacteria72. In addition, A. burdickii and P. vandeheii also harbor metal-dependent β-lactamase superfamily-I and III proteins, which are known for their involvement in the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics73. This enzyme family plays a significant role in conferring resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins. Furthermore, multidrug resistance efflux pumps such as the acriflavine resistance protein and Multidrug And Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) family of Multidrug Resistance (MDR) efflux pumps were found to be present in Leifsonia species and spore-formers. These efflux pumps contribute to bacterial resistance by actively pumping out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds from the cell, including antibiotics and toxic compounds, thereby reducing their intracellular concentrations and promoting bacterial survival. The acriflavin resistance protein (AcrA) is a crucial component of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, which confers resistance to acriflavin and other antimicrobial compounds. Its role in antibiotic resistance, multidrug efflux, intracellular homeostasis, biofilm formation, and potentially bacterial virulence underscores its significance in bacterial survival and adaptation. Understanding AcrA's function may aid in the development of strategies to combat antibiotic resistance and improve therapeutic approaches against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Given its involvement in antibiotic resistance and multidrug efflux, AcrA has emerged as a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents74. By inhibiting the function of AcrA or other components of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, it may be possible to overcome bacterial resistance and enhance the effectiveness of existing antibiotics. Identification of fosfomycin resistance protein (fosB) in both Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes in this study is crucial for effective infection control measures and the development of strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance. It has been reported that fosB is significant due to its impact on the treatment of bacterial infections, the emergence of multidrug resistance, the potential for horizontal gene transfer, and its implications for public health75. Streptothricin acetyltransferase was present in both Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes and it was reported that streptothricin is a valuable antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against microorganisms and can help reduce crop losses and increase agricultural productivity76. Its significance extends beyond its direct antimicrobial properties, finding applications in research, agriculture, and drug development. Understanding streptothricin's mode of action and resistance mechanisms contributes to our knowledge of antibiotics and aids in the development of novel strategies to combat bacterial infections. Streptothricin has shown efficacy in agricultural practices, particularly in plant and fungal disease management76. The ribosome protection-type tetracycline resistance-related proteins, group 2, are crucial determinants of resistance to tetracycline antibiotics in both Gram-stain-negative and positive microbes77. Their ability to protect ribosomes from the inhibitory effects of tetracycline enables microbial survival and growth in the presence of the antibiotic. The presence of these proteins in spore-forming novel species during this study and not in non-spore-forming bacteria needs further research. Choloylglycine hydrolase plays a critical role in bile acid metabolism, enterohepatic circulation, and the regulation of the bile acid pool78 and predicted only in the S. highlanderae genome. Its activity influences the composition and function of the gut microbiota and has implications for host health and disease79. Understanding the significance of this enzyme provides insights into bile acid metabolism disorders80 and potential therapeutic approaches for related conditions. Multiple genes for bioremediation of toxic material, enhanced plant growth, and survival in extreme conditions are predicted in the genomes of these novel species. Except for P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, all the other species possess the capability to perform polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism. However, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT stands out as it can utilize glutathione as a sulfur source, due to the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2)81. Within the P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT strain, we identified paeninodin (60%) and bacillopaline (100%), which were originally characterized in Paenibacillus dendritiformis C45482 and Paenibacillus mucilaginosus KNP41483, respectively. Furthermore, this strain harbors a siderophore gene cluster (100%) responsible for producing the antimycobacterial agent bacillibactin84. The siderophore cluster also facilitates the conversion of iron from Fe3+ to Fe2+, which is a more usable form for the microbe and its plant host under iron-limited conditions. Siderophore synthesis gene clusters are rare in Paenibacillus species and are believed to have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer events85. Genome mining resulted in identifying key functional genes of the novel species described in this study are listed in Table 7. Among all the novel species, mining of A. burdickii genome shows metal-dependent hydrolases of the β-lactamase superfamily III (MBL-III) enzyme. The MBL-III enzymes have shown potential in bioremediation processes aimed at the degradation of environmental pollutants86. The ability of MBL-III enzymes to degrade diverse chemical compounds, including pesticides, herbicides, and aromatic compounds, makes them valuable tools in the cleanup of contaminated environments87. These MBL-III enzymes can contribute to the removal and detoxification of pollutants, reducing their impact on ecosystems. Similarly, only in the genome of A. burdickii, DNA-binding heavy metal response regulator is predicted as shown in Arthrobacter sp. H-02-388 which plays a crucial role in cellular responses to heavy metal exposure, including detoxification, metal homeostasis, stress response, and environmental adaptation. In the genome of L. virtsii, organomercurial lyase is predicted which is reported to play a crucial role in the detoxification of organomercurial compounds, contributing to the protection of organisms and ecosystems by actinobacteria88. Its significance lies in the detoxification of toxic organomercurials, environmental protection, potential applications in bioremediation, insights into enzyme mechanisms, and biotechnological applications. Understanding and harnessing the capabilities of organomercurial lyase can aid in addressing mercury pollution and developing sustainable solutions for environmental and human health challenges88. The magnesium and cobalt efflux protein (CorC) plays a significant role in maintaining metal ion homeostasis, protecting against metal toxicity, facilitating adaptation to metal-rich environments, and contributing to bacterial stress response. Its activity is important for cellular functions and can also impact antibiotic resistance. The identification of CorC in only three Leifsonia genomes during this study, while not observed in other novel species, holds significant potential for enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms employed by actinobacterial group to regulate metal ions and adapt to diverse environmental conditions. In summary, the rare microbiome is instrumental in maintaining ecosystem stability, adapting to environmental changes, facilitating ecological interactions, spurring biotechnological innovation, and bolstering conservation efforts. Investigations into, and preservation of, the rare microbiome enhance our understanding of microbial diversity and ecosystem dynamics, thereby contributing to the sustainable management of the ecosystems. Conservation strategies should consider the preservation of rare microorganisms, as their loss could precipitate cascading effects on ecosystem functioning and resilience. Our study of novel microbes and predicted bioactive compounds contributes to our understanding of the microbial ecosystem on the ISS and lays the groundwork for further investigation into the potential implications of these novel species for the health and well-being of the ISS crew, as well as future space missions. The presence of specific genes and proteins in these novel species underscores their adaptive capabilities and potential resistance mechanisms against a variety of environmental challenges, including exposure to antibiotics. A deeper understanding of the genetic composition and functional capabilities of these novel species provides valuable insights into their survival strategies and could contribute to the development of improved antimicrobial therapies and strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.",

Copyright notice ID: 10628120 PMID: 37932283 Abstract With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values, when compared to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for all species described here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (= NRRL B-65660T = DSM 115933T), Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (= NRRL B-65661T = DSM 115931T), Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT (= NRRL B-65662T = DSM 115932T), Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (= NRRL B-65663T = DSM 115940T), and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (= NRRL B-65664T = DSM 115943T). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions. Subject terms: Environmental microbiology, Functional genomics, Genome, ProkaryoteIntroduction Multiple low-Earth orbit and lunar orbit space habitats are being planned by governmental and commercial entities as part of the newly revitalized space industry in the 2020s. Cleaning practices and microbial monitoring to ensure crew safety will likely be based on information garnered from studies of the International Space Station (ISS), which is the only space habitat currently in orbit with a long-term history of human habitation. Surfaces of the crew resupply vehicles1 and cargo destined to the ISS are cleaned to minimize microbial contamination and protect crew health. Nevertheless, the constant presence of human crew members (approximately six at any given time) on the ISS may lead to the shedding of microorganisms onto its surfaces, potentially causing recontamination and becoming dominant members of the habitat’s microbiome2. As a result, ISS surfaces are required to be routinely (once a week) cleaned to maintain a low biomass level (< 104 CFU/100 cm2 bacteria and < 100 CFU/100 cm2 fungi)3. Despite this rigorous cleaning and maintenance, it has been reported that some resilient microbes, albeit in low numbers, have adapted to microgravity conditions and persist4. Examples are the discovery of a novel bacterial genus found repeatedly in metagenomes, which has subsequently been isolated from ISS surfaces during further sampling campaigns5, and the isolation of the same clonal strains of Acinetobacter pittii from ISS surfaces during different years and sampling campaigns6. Characterizing the genomes and adaptation mechanisms of rare or novel species that manage to recolonize ISS surfaces is important because rare species are more likely to have narrow niche breadth, and so are persisting due to adaptive mechanisms to the stresses of radiation, desiccation, and microgravity conditions rather than via generalist strategies. Such microbes are therefore also fertile grounds for biotechnology applications research. Characterizing novel microbial species on the ISS is crucial for monitoring microbial contamination and protecting astronaut health. The process of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species found on the ISS helps to identify potential pathogens, as well as to understand potential impact on the spacecraft and its equipment (for example, in biofouling). Easily detecting or identifying a potential microbial threat, whether it be to human health or to the operation of the spacecraft or space station, depends on having an up-to-date, comprehensive database of microbial genomes, their species identity and their phenotypic characteristics (for example, are they known to carry or easily acquire antimicrobial resistance genes, are they UV resistant, what types of surfaces are they more likely to be found on, etc.). This is particularly the case when genetic information about a microbial threat is collected via shotgun metagenomic sequencing rather than by whole genome sequencing of pure culture; in that case, accurate identification relies entirely on an accurate database. The process of characterizing the previously unsequenced cultivable microbiome of space habitats continues to reduce the amount of microbial ‘dark matter’ found in metagenomic sequencing results. In the ongoing Microbial Tracking (MT) investigation of the ISS7,8, out of 510 genomes sequenced, 56 microbial species have been isolated multiple times, representing 27 microbial genera (19 bacteria and 8 fungi). Dominant microbial species include bacterial genera Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Acinetobacter, yeast genus Rhodotorula, and fungal genera Penicillium, Aureobasidium, and Aspergillus9–25. In this communication, six strains isolated from various ISS environmental surfaces belonging to five novel bacterial species constituting four different genera (Arthrobacter, Leifsonia, Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina) are described. Since recent bacterial taxonomy heavily depends on genomic characterization, WGS of these novel species were generated and compared with publicly available genomes of closely related species. One of the objectives of this study was to establish these six strains as novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, physiological, and phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes) analyses were carried out. To discover the phylogenetic placement within their respective genera, we have employed multiple gene analyses and WGS-based phylogenies containing all shared single-copy core genes. The second objective was to quantify the abundance of these recently identified species in the metagenomes of ISS surfaces. Hence, an in-depth analysis was conducted on the metagenomes collected during seven different flight missions, consisting of 106 individual samples, to assess the presence and prevalence of the species. In addition, an attempt was made to generate metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) of these novel species from the ISS metagenomes. Finally, antiSMASH analysis was performed to identify, annotate, and analyze secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) in the genomes of these novel bacterial species. Specialized metabolites and natural products encoded by these novel bacterial BGCs might provide insight into how different bacterial species thrive and interact in ISS conditions.Materials and methods Sample collection and isolation During the MT-1 and MT-2 mission series, samples were collected from the same set of eight surfaces aboard the ISS using pre-packaged and pre-sterilized wipes7,8. Upon return to Earth, among other strains belonging to previously defined species, six strains were isolated from both the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) platform and crew quarters when grown on blood agar (37 °C for 24 h) or R2A (25 °C for 7 days) media which were unable to be assigned to a known species and were suspected to be novel. Preliminary 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strains isolated during Flight 3 (n = 1) from the ARED platform (IIF3SC-B10T) and Flight 6 (n = 5) from both the ARED platform (F6_3S_P_1B and F6_3S_P_1CT) and crew quarters (F6_8S_P_1AT, F6_8S_P_1BT and F6_8S_P_1C) belonged to four different genera: Arthrobacter, Leifsonia, Paenibacillus, and Sporosarcina. However, further WGS analysis is required to identify the strains at the species level.Light microscopy and SEM A liquid culture of spore-forming strains was heat shocked (80 °C for 10 min), then plated on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) and grown at 30 °C for 5 days to induce endospore formation. Endospore staining with malachite green and safranin was performed using the Schaeffer-Fulton method26. Light microscopy and phase contrast images were taken on an Olympus BX53 microscope with an Olympus DP25 camera using Olympus cellSens software. All strains were grown out on TSA media at 24 °C for 72 h. An isolated colony was fixed in a 4 °C solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, United States) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (NaCaco) (Sigma Aldrich) for an hour. The suspended cells were collected using a vacuum pump and a 0.2 µm Isopore filter membrane (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, United States), and then transferred into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. The sample was incubated in 0.1 M NaCaco solution at 4 °C for 10 min and then replaced with fresh 0.1 M NaCaco solution; this washing step was repeated a total of 3 times. The sample then went through dehydration by a step series of increasing IPA and water solutions at 10 min intervals. The series was: 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 100%, with the final 100% rinsing occurring 3 times. The sample was stored at 4 °C in 100% IPA until it was then critically point dried in a Tousimis Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Rockville, MD, United States). Samples were affixed with carbon tape to SEM stubs (Ted Pella Inc.) and then were coated in a ~ 12 nm thick carbon layer by a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Deerfield, IL, United States). SEM images were collected on a FEI Quanta 200F microscope (Themo Fisher, Waltham, MA, United States) located at the California Institute of Technologies Kavli Nanoscience Institute.Biochemical tests and phenotype characterization Growth temperature and other phenotypic parameters of the tested strains were assessed as follows. Bacterial strains were inoculated in both solid (R2A plates) and liquid (trypticase soy broth (TSB), BD Diagnostics Cat # 257107) media in 15 ml loose-capped centrifuge tubes and grown at temperatures of 4, 15, 25, 30, 37, and 45 °C. Growth on plates and in tubes was monitored daily for 7 days, and incubation was halted if growth was observed. Samples grown at 4 °C and 15 °C were incubated for an additional 4 weeks and 2 weeks, respectively, for final growth assessment. Salt tolerance was determined by inoculating the strains onto R2A plates containing 0–5% added NaCl, as well as agar containing only peptone plus 0 or 1% NaCl and examining growth after 7 days of incubation at 30 °C. Oxidase activity was determined by using OxiDrops™ Liquid Oxidase Reagent (Hardy Diagnostics) on solid culture. Catalase activity was determined by observing effervescence when bacterial colonies were mixed with hydrogen peroxide on a sterile glass slide. Finally, pH tolerance (4 to 10) was tested by adjusting the pH of TSB broth with biological buffers, as described in Xu et al.27. Biochemical tests were performed for each strain using a Gram-positive identification card (Vitek 2 GP ID, bioMérieux) according to manufacturers’ protocol. Briefly, freshly grown colonies were transferred aseptically into a saline (aqueous 0.45% to 0.50% NaCl, pH 4.5 to 7.0) tube to prepare homogenous suspension with a density equivalent to a McFarland No. 0.50 to 0.63 using a calibrated VITEK® 2 DensiCHEK™ Plus. The suspension tube and Vitek 2 GP ID card were placed in the cassette and incubated at 37 °C. Data entry, cassette loading to instrument and retrieval of raw data were done according to the VITEK instrument user manual. Test results were recorded within 10 h of incubation. Phenotypic fingerprints were generated through GNIII MicroPlate according to BioLog's protocol. Briefly, freshly grown colonies were transferred aseptically into the inoculum solution A (Cat #. 72401; BioLog) to prepare homogenous suspension with a density equivalent to a McFarland No. 0.50. Inoculum was loaded onto BioLog GNIII MicroPlate (100 µl per well) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. OmniLog values (A590-A750) were recorded after a minimum 10 h of incubation using MicroPlate reader (FLUO star Omega, BMG Labtech, Germany).Chemotaxonomy To analyze the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), cells were grown on TSA at 30 °C for 48 h until they reached mid-exponential growth phase. The harvested cell biomass was subjected to saponification, methylation, and extraction28 for fatty acid analysis, which was carried out using the Microbial Identification System (MIDI)29 with the Aerobe (RTSBA6) database (Sherlock version 6.0) following the standard protocol30. A gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) with a flame ionization detector was used for FAME analysis, and identification and comparison of the results were made using the MIDI System. To extract and analyze quinones, polar lipids and peptidoglycans, cells were cultivated on TSA for 3 days at 30 °C. The polar lipids and quinones were extracted and analyzed by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (2D-TLC)31. To visualize the different classes of polar lipids, the developed TLC plates were treated with 10% (w/v) ethanolic phosphomolybdic acid for total lipids, 0.2% (w/v) ninhydrin in butanol for aminolipids (specific for amino groups), Dittmer and Lester’s Zinzadze reagent for phospholipids (specific for phosphates), and α-naphthol for glycolipids (specific for sugars). Peptidoglycans were extracted and analyzed for the diagnostic amino acids from whole cells32.DNA extraction and whole genome sequencing To extract genomic DNA from the novel species, the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit was utilized, following the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare the library for WGS, an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit was used as described earlier10. Sequencing of prepared libraries was carried out on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform. The read qualities were evaluated using FastQC v.0.11.733, and subsequenly quality filtered, trimmed and cleared of adapter sequences using fastp v0.2034. Draft genomes were assembled using SPAdes v.3.11.135 up to the scaffold level, and the assembly quality was evaluated using QUAST v.5.0.236. The default settings were employed for all steps except for fastp, which included 512 adapters screening. In addition to Illumina WGS, a secondary round of sequencing was carried out for strains IIF3SC-B10T and F6_8S_P_1BT using Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Additionally, Sporosarcina thermotolerans CCUG 53480 T, kindly provided by Dr. Edward Moore from the Culture Collection University of Gothenburg (CCUG), Sweden, also underwent WGS with the use of Nanopore MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Nanopore sequencing libraries were prepared using the SQK-RBK114.24 rapid chemistry-based barcoding kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Long read sequencing was conducted using an R.10.4.1 flow cell. Base calling was performed via MinKnow/Guppy. Adapters were trimmed using Porechop (v.0.2.4)37 and reads were filtered using filtlong v.0.2.1, with parameters –min_length 1000 –keep_percent 90. For strains IIF3SC-B10T and F6_8S_P_1BT, a hybrid genome assembly was generated using Unicycler (v.0.5.0)38. For strain CCUG 53480T a long-read only assembly was generated using the same tool with default settings. Genome assembly quality was assessed using QUAST (v.5.2.0)36.ANI and dDDH analyses To elucidate species affiliation of the isolated genomes, we retrieved all validly described and representative genomes of four identified genera from the  database using the command-line tool ‘bit’39. We calculated the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to perform pairwise nucleotide-level comparisons. For ANI calculations, we employed FastANI v.1.33, which is a rapid alignment-free computational method, with the novel species as a query against other genomes. To estimate the in-silico DNA–DNA hybridization, we used the recommended formula 2 of the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC) v.3.0 with the BLAST + alignment tool40. To further evaluate the genetic relatedness of the genomes of the genera Sporosarcina, ANI based analysis was used. All available genomes on the  GenBank database under the genera Sporosarcina (n = 93) were retrieved using ncbi-genome-download (v.0.3.1). An all-vs-all ANI analysis of the genomes was conducted and drawn using ANIclustermap (v.1.2.0).Phylogenetic analysis The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the novel species were extracted from their WGS. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for each genus by incorporating publicly available 16S sequences of all the species within the respective genus. In cases where only the WGS was publicly available, a blast wrapper script was employed to extract the 16S sequence. The trees were rooted using a related species within the same family. The DECIPHER package was used to align and trim the 16S sequences41. To build phylogenetic trees, the phangorn package was used42 on maximum likelihood with AIC values and 1,000 bootstrap replicates42. The trees were visualized using Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL)43. We created a whole genome-based phylogenies to identify closely related species of the isolated genomes. We used GToTree v.1.7.0744, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based command-line tool which aligns identified single copy genes using Muscle v.3.8 and produces concatenated protein alignment. For the Arthrobacter and Leifsonia genomes, we used 138 single-copy gene (SCG) sets of Actinobacteria, while for the Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes, we used 119 SCG sets of Firmicutes. IQTREE v.2.2.0.3 with ModelFinder-Plus was then used to construct the phylogenetic tree from the protein alignment with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates45–47. We further retrieved 4,552 complete, non-anomalous, representative genomes of bacteria from  Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database and constructed a phylogenetic tree of life along with the novel species using 16 SCG-set as previously described48 (data not shown). Genomes containing at least 40% of the total 16 SGC targets were placed in the phylogenetic tree. All the trees were further annotated and visualized using interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) v.6.749.Mapping metagenome sequence reads from ISS to isolated novel species To investigate the presence of the isolated novel species in environmental samples from ISS, we retrieved paired-end metagenomics reads from two microbial tracking (MT) missions, MT-1 (n = 42) and MT-2 (n = 64), from the  Short Read Archive with project accession PRJNA4385454 and PRJNA7812778, respectively. Quality filtering of the metagenomes was performed using Trimmomatic v.0.39 with a sliding window of 4 bases and an average quality per base cutoff of 2050. We used MetaCompass v.2.051 to perform reference-guided assembly of the aligned metagenome reads against isolated genomes of novel species. We quantified the number of reads that aligned to the isolated genomes and assessed the breadth of the coverage of the assembled reads in each sample. We further tried to bin the contigs using MetaBAT v.2.12.1, but were unable to resolve any MAGs.Genome annotation and prediction of secondary-metabolite biosynthetic potential The gene prediction and annotation of the novel genomes were performed using the Rapid Annotations based on Subsystem Technology (RAST) online server using RAST-tk annotation scheme52. The Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) v6.0.1 web portal which utilizes the CARD v3.2.6 database was used to identify antibiotic resistance genes and markers in the novel species from ISS environments with only “Perfect” and “Strict” matches. Secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were identified within each novel genomes using antiSMASH v.7.0.0 with a “strict” detection system53. The identified BGCs were curated for functional annotation using MIBiG v.3.1 JSON file via an in-house Python script54.Results The six strains isolated during this study belonged to five novel species spanning four bacterial genera. Among the six strains, four were non-spore-forming members and two strains formed endospores. Based on 16S rRNA gene similarities, not all strains were identified into a novel bacterial species, but ANI/dDDH analyses allowed them to be placed into five distinct bacterial species. They were: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT, Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT, Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T. In addition, the WGS of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was generated and compared with the genome of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T to identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits. Genome characteristics and relatedness indices Table 1 summarizes the assembly statistics for all six strains. The draft genomes of the novel bacterial species were assembled using high-quality sequences, and their assembly quality varied from a single contig to 49 scaffolds. The non-spore-forming strains had high GC contents, ranging from 68% to 71.4%, whereas spore-forming strains, such as P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (46.1%) and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (41.6%), had low GC content. The total number of predicted genes was 2166 for S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T and 4861 for P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. However, the non-spore-forming bacterial species had ~ 3444 to 3850 coding regions (Table 1). In addition to the novel species, the complete genome of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was generated and compared to S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T strain since both shared > 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities.

The 16S rRNA gene sequences of all five novel species described in this study exhibited > 99% similarities to previously established species. However, the gyrB gene sequence similarities of the novel species with the closely related species ranged from 88.6 to 92.8% and could serve as a genetic marker to distinguish the novel species. Moreover, ANI indices (< 95%) and dDDH values (< 70%) fell below the threshold levels of bacterial species identity and confirmed that the examined ISS strains were novel species. Table 2.

This suggests that the 16S rRNA gene may not be an adequate marker for distinguishing members within this genus. However, upon analyzing the gyrB gene sequences of this phylogenetic clade, the similarity values were found to be below 85.9%. Furthermore, strain IIF3SC-B10T displayed low values for digital dDDH (24.5%) and ANI indices (82.9%). These findings provide additional evidence supporting its classification as a novel species. In the 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree encompassing all Arthrobacter species (Fig. 1A), with Micrococcus antarcticus as the outgroup, strain IIF3SC-B10T clustered together with officially named species such as A. agilis, A. cheniae, A. bussei, and A. antioxidans (Fig. 1A). However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 1B), constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 59 genomes containing 138 single-copy core genes common to all Actinobacteria, A. burdickii was found to be distinct from the A. ruber and A. cheniae clades. Instead, it exhibited closer similarity to the unrecognized species A. sedimenti (ANI 93.8%). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Arthrobacter species including strain IIF3SC-B10T based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 138 single-copy core genes of phylum Actinobacteria, keeping Kocuria rhizophila as an outgroup.The 16S rRNA gene sequences of L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT, isolated from crew quarters in Flight 6, exhibited > 98.9% similarity to L. soli and L. shinshuensis, indicating that the 16S rRNA gene is not a suitable marker for distinguishing members of this genus. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences of the members of this phylogenetic clade, the similarity values were below 91.7%. However, the strain F6_8S_P_1AT exhibited low dDDH values (< 28.3%) and ANI indices (86.3%), providing further evidence that it belongs to a novel species. In the 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree of all Leifsonia species, with Rathayibacter tritici as the outgroup, strain F6_8S_P_1AT was placed within a clade that also included the validly described species L. aquatica, L. xyli, L. lichenia, L. shinshuensis, and L. soli (Fig. 2A). However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 2B), which was constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters of eight available genomes containing a total of 138 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Actinobacteria, L. virtsii was separated from all these Leifsonia species. The next closest member was L. soli (ANI 86.3%). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Leifsonia species including strains F6_8S_P_1AT, F6_8S_P_1BT and F6_8S_P_1C based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 138 single-copy core genes of phylum Actinobacteria, keeping Nocardia fluminea as an outgroup.In addition to L. virtsii, two strains were identified as L. williamsii based on their gyrB sequence similarity (91.6%), ANI index (84.3%), and dDDH value (24.7%), which were below the species threshold level. Surprisingly, despite the high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between L. virtsii and L. williamsii (99.2%), the 16S rRNA gene tree (Fig. 2A) placed them in different clades, supported by 88% bootstrap values. Notably, the L. williamsii strains were isolated from the same crew quarter location as L. virtsii, and they even originated from the same culture plate of R2A medium. Initially, there was a suspicion that they might be clones from the same colony, but further analysis using WGS and gyrB sequencing confirmed that they were distinct novel species. In contrast to the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, the WGS-based tree (Fig. 2B) clearly differentiated L. williamsii from L. virtsii. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, isolated from the ARED’s surface during Flight 6, exhibited 99.5% similarity to P. pabuli, indicating that the 16S rRNA gene is not a suitable marker for distinguishing members of this genus. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences, P. pabuli also exhibited 94.9% similarity with P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. Since it was established that ~ 95% gyrB as cut-off value for species delineation, WGS was performed which showed that ANI index was only 88.4%. Based on low ANI index and dDDH value (34.6%), P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT is differentiated from P. pabuli and described as a novel species. The 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny (Fig. 3A) showed that P. xylanivrans, P. taichungensis, and P. paubli formed a tight clade with > 99% similarities among them. However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 3B), which was constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 244 genomes containing a total of 119 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Firmicutes, P. vandeheii was separated from all these Paenibacillus species and was found to be closer to the P. xylanivorans (ANI 92.8%). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree of Paenibacillus species including strain F6_3S_P_1CT based on (a) 16S rRNA genes and (b) 119 single-copy core genes of phylum Firmicutes, keeping Bacillus subtilis as an outgroup.The strain F6_3S_P_2T, another spore-forming bacterium belonging to the genus Sporosarcina and isolated from the ARED surface during Flight 6, displayed a 99.8% similarity to S. thermotolerans based on the 16S rRNA gene. This finding highlights the difficulty in classifying spore-forming microorganisms using the 16S rRNA gene marker. Hence, the WGS of S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was needed to identify the phylogenetic position of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences, S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T exhibited an 87.0% similarity with S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T. Furthermore, the ANI index between the genomes of F6_3S_P_2T and S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T was only 85.3%. Considering the low ANI index and dDDH value (29.8%), S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T can be identified as a novel species, distinct from S. thermotolerans. In the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny (Fig. 4A), S. thermotolerans, S. luteola, and S. saromensis formed a closely related clade with > 99% similarities among them. However, S. koreensis did not cluster within this clade, despite having a 16S rRNA gene similarity with S. highlanderae. On the other hand, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 4B), constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 15 genomes containing 119 single-copy core genes common to all species in the Firmicutes, S. highlanderae was separated from all other Sporosarcina species. Instead, it exhibited closer similarity to S. thermotolerans (ANI 85.3%). Figure 4.

A. burdickii can be phenotypically differentiated from other closely related Arthrobacter species since maltose, trehalose, cellobiose, turanose, and acetoacetic acid were not utilized as sole carbon substrate (Table 3). The Leifsonia species did not show any specific phenotypic characteristics that could be used to differentiate them from other closely related Leifsonia species; hence, molecular phylogeny is essential (Table 4). P. vandeheii was able to grow at 8% NaCl which can be used as discriminative test. Oxidase test was also positive whereas P. tundrae, P. xylanexedens, and P. amylolitus were negative. In addition, P. vandeheii can be differentiated by the utilization of Tween 40, turanose, γ-hydroxybutyric acid, l-malic acid, and l-serine as sole carbon source from P. taichungensis and P. paubli which are negative (Table 5).

Additionally, A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T was found to possess a significant amount of an unidentified phospholipid (PL1), a characteristic that sets it apart from Leifsonia species. P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited a complex polar lipid profile, which included phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, two unidentified phospholipids and an unidentified aminophospholipid. On the other hand, S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T was found to contain phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine two unidentified phospholipids and an identified lipid.

To assess the presence of viable and intact cells of the novel species, we utilized propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment on the samples as previously described7,8. Our findings revealed that the majority of the metagenomes had less than 0.1% of their total reads mapped to the novel species. Among all the species analyzed, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited the highest mapping, with a maximum of 1.05% of total reads from a sample collected during Flight 2 near the port crew quarters (location 8) during MT-1. Therefore, we can conclude that none of these novel species are dominant in the ISS. Considering the limited proportion of reads mapped to the novel species, we proceeded to perform read assembly to explore the breadth of coverage against the isolated genomes. Interestingly, reads mapped to L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT and L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT from Flight 6 at location 8 exhibited a breadth of coverage of 59.4% and 80.7% respectively, despite representing a small fraction of the total reads (Fig. 6). However, apart from these cases, the overall breadth of coverage for the genomes was quite low, averaging at 0.21% hence, no MAG was generated. We also analyzed the PMA untreated samples and observed the similar pattern in the distribution of the breadth of coverages. Additionally, we noticed 84.4% breadth of coverage for L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT during Flight 7 at location 8 from where the strain was isolated. Despite the presence of a high breadth of coverage for Leifsonia genomes across multiple samples, we were unable to obtain MAGs due to the failure of achieving the minimum coverage depth threshold of 4X. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Box plots showing breadth of coverage of the consensus genome constructed from mapped reads aligned to the novel species (percent coverage was less than 1% in all cases). Due to high variations in the breadth of coverages of Leifsonia genomes, a broken Y-axis was used. The reads were collected from eight locations on the ISS across seven separate time points/flights as part of the Microbial Tracking project(s).Functional characterization of the novel species To investigate the genetic characteristics of the six novel strains, we performed a comprehensive genome annotation using RAST-tk (Table 7; Supplemental Table S4). The subsystem mapping results are as follows: A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (283 subsystems), L. virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (273 subsystems), L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT (262 subsystems), L. williamsii F6_8S_P_1CT (262 subsystems), P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (324 subsystems), and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (307 subsystems). Among the annotated subsystems, the top categories based on average gene counts included amino acids and derivatives (260 genes), carbohydrate metabolism (232 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (136 genes), and protein metabolism (171 genes).

Two mechanisms were predicted as the primarily function of these genes: resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and invasion and intracellular resistance. A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, in particular, is the only species that harbors the sarcosine oxidase (EC 1.5.3.1) gene, which is involved in the osmotic stress response. On the other hand, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T, both belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, possess a specific mechanism to respond to bacitracin-induced stress through the bceABRS four-component system. Notably, these two species also possess additional stress response mechanisms for periplasmic stress via the intramembrane protease RasP/YluC. While exploring other factors, it was observed that A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T does not possess any genes associated with motility. However, the other novel species have genes related to motility, including flagellar biosynthesis proteins. Among all the species, only P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT has the chemotaxis subsystem. We conducted further investigations into the metabolic potential of these novel species and made some noteworthy observations. A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T was found to possess a significantly higher number of genes related to aromatic compound metabolism, while having fewer genes associated with iron metabolism compared to the other species characterized in this study. With the exception of P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, all the other species exhibited the capability to perform polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism. However, only P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, due to the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2), can utilize glutathione as a sulfur source. Considering the concerns regarding spore-forming bacteria and their resistance to sterilization processes in the ISS, we further explored the spore-forming capabilities of these novel species. As expected, a significant number of genes associated with dormancy and sporulation were predicted in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T genomes. Between them, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited the highest number of 40 genes, primarily associated with spore germination and spore maturation processes. In contrast, the other species are non-spore forming and do not possess specific proteins associated with sporulation.Antimicrobial resistance properties of the novel species In the isolated five novel species, we searched for antibiotic resistance genes against the CARD database60 and calculated the percentage identity with the reference sequences. Overall, these genomes showed potential resistance to seven drug classes, including rifamycin and tetracycline antibiotics. Interestingly, we found that all of these genomes contained genes from vancomycin resistance gene clusters with an identity ranging from 30.7% to 51.5%. Among other identified resistance genes, we discovered the presence of rifampicin monooxygenase (RIFMO) in Leifsonia species with a 63% match, which catalyzes the inactivation of the antibiotic rifampicin. In P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, we identified a set of markers, including Llm 23S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase (LlmA_23S_CLI) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), which exhibited high sequence identities of 84.67% and 87.91%, respectively. LlmA_23S_CLI was originally detected in Paenibacillus sp. LC231, a strain isolated from Lechuguilla Cave, NM, USA61. Additionally, strain F6_3S_P_1CT was found to possess two genes, qacG and qacJ, which are part of a small multidrug resistance efflux pump conferring resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). Furthermore, in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T, we identified the presence of tetracycline-resistant ribosomal protection genes tetB(P) and tet(Q), respectively, with approximately 30% similarity. These provide resistance by preventing the binding of the antibiotic tetracycline to the bacterial ribosome. Moreover, these genomes also encode orthologues of the antibiotic-inactivating enzyme fosfomycin thiol transferase. The genomic mining predicted the presence of AMR genes but the confirmation of the phenotypic resistance requires further investigation.Production of secondary metabolites To explore the potential for producing secondary metabolites in the newly discovered species, we utilized antiSMASH, a bioinformatics tool for predicting putative BGCs. This analysis revealed a total of 16 cluster types, including βlactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters (Table 8). In A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, we identified a moderately matched thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161, known for its effectiveness against multidrug-resistant Gram-stain-positive bacteria and fungi62. Furthermore, in the isolated Leifsonia species, we found two well-known gene clusters: T3PKS-alkylresorcinol and NAPAA (non-α poly-amino acids) ε-Poly-l-lysine (ε-PL), both with a 100% match. Among the analyzed species, Leifsonia species shared a partially matched carotenoid BGC with P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. However, several unique cluster types, including cyclic-lactone-autoinducer, lanthipeptide, lassopeptide, NRP-metallophore, opine-like-metallophore, and proteusin, were identified exclusively in P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT. Notably, within the F6_3S_P_1CT strain, we also identified BGCs paeninodin (60%) and bacillopaline (100%). Lastly, S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T exhibited one phosphonate, one T3PKS, and one terpene BGC, although these clusters have not yet been fully characterized. Table 8.

Missions to the moon are already underway, and missions to Mars are planned for the near future. Such missions will be measured in multiple years rather than in months and will have no or little resupply from Earth. In such cases, the microbiome of the space vessel or habitat will need to be monitored for multiple reasons: the spread of pathogens through the air or on surfaces which could infect humans63 or plants64 as well as the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes65, the health of human commensal microbiomes (and potential overgrowth of secondary pathogens), and the potential for biofouling of fluid lines or water supplies via microbial overgrowth66. Also, with no resupply from Earth there is no ability to gain access to Earth’s massive microbial biodiversity. Unless specific microbes are stocked as supplies before launch1, the microbes found on the spacecraft or habitat are the only ones which could be used for the many commercial purposes that microbes are used for on Earth: antibiotic or therapeutic discovery, manufacturing of drugs, food, and vitamins, plant growth enhancement, probiotics, etc. Biological in-situ resource utilization may also require bioremediation or bioconversion of raw, potentially toxic materials collected from moons, other planets, or asteroids/comets. Whether or not the microbiome of a space habitat can be controlled and repurposed to this extent depends on a number of factors, including (1) whether the microbial diversity of such a space habitat would be sufficient to include all the traits desired for the many purposes listed above, (2) accurate detection and identification of already-known microbes and taxonomic placement of unidentified microbes, including whether shotgun metagenomic sequencing would detect the presence of problematic microbes from low biomass surfaces, and (3) characterization of potential phenotypic traits based on genomic predictions. Like the proverbial mustard seed, perhaps we inadvertently carry a planet’s worth of microbial diversity wherever we travel. The novel microbes described herein are not necessarily any more noteworthy than those which might be isolated from an office building on Earth [though they are likely far more resilient given the harsh conditions67 of the space environment], and yet each hosts significant potential for affecting human health5 or for use in assisting plant growth68, bioremediation or manufacturing, and offers a glimpse into the genetic and metabolic potential of the microbial diversity of the ISS69. The most abundant cultivable microbes on ISS surfaces include common, well-studied human commensals such as Staphylococcus, Rhodotorula, Penicillium, and Micrococcus species. However, there are many more that have only been isolated once aboard the ISS and which are at very low abundance—potentially shed from individual astronauts, from experiments such as plant grow-ins, from new pieces of cargo, or from the vast microbial diversity of the human gut—which can be considered a part of the rare microbiome. Although individually rare, members of this community collectively play significant roles in ecosystem functioning and stability, including functional redundancy which enhances the resilience and stability of ecosystems by ensuring that multiple microbial species can perform essential ecological functions, such as nutrient cycling, decomposition, and symbiotic interactions. The novel bacterial species described during this study belong to rare microbial species since their incidence in the shotgun metagenomes was very low, and only the two Leifsonia species had sufficiently high breadth of coverage of mapped metagenomic reads from the ISS crew quarters to have been definitively identified using shotgun metagenomic sequencing without culturing as well. Previous to using a WGS approach, the diversity of the ISS cultivable microbiome was significantly underestimated due to reliance on only 16S-based taxonomic identification. However, for many bacterial genera, 16S rRNA gene sequencing strategy fails to differentiate new species with significantly different phenotypic traits. For instance, there is 99.8% similarity between the 16S rRNA genes of S. highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T and S. thermotolerans CCUG 53480T, with a mere 3 base pair substitutions. Without access to the whole genome, S. highlanderae would be categorized as S. thermotolerans, even though it is not a thermophile. Upon accessing all 93 Sporosarcina genomes from the  database and generating an ANI heatmap (Supplemental Figure S2), it was evident that this clade contains at least five novel genera and 56 species which are yet to be described. This inference was based on ANI values of less than 70% for 14 Sporosarcina genomes, encompassing S. highlanderae, S. thermotolerans, and S. luteola and further emphasizes that the 16S rRNA gene on its own is not a reliable tool for differentiating among members of the Sporosarcina genus. Placing these 93 genomes into their phylogenetic affiliation require more study. Upon examining 337 ISS bacterial genomes (plus six novel strains) belonging to 36 bacterial species (plus five novel species), it was observed that non-dominant, rare, and phylogenetically undescribed species predicted to produce natural products. As their genetic and phenotypic potential remains uncharacterized, exploration of the rare microbiome can lead to the discovery of novel bioactive compounds, enzymes, and metabolic pathways. Many of these rare microorganisms have untapped biotechnological potential, with applications in fields such as medicine, agriculture, industry, and environmental remediation. Studying the rare microbiome can uncover valuable resources for the development of new biotechnological tools and processes. In the case of A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, we identified a moderately matched thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161, known for its efficacy against multidrug-resistant Gram-stain-positive bacteria and fungi62. Leifsonia species contain alkylresorcinol, which exhibits various activities including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and genotoxicity effects70. Additionally, alkylresorcinol plays a role in bacterial cyst formation during unfavorable environmental conditions71. On the other hand, ε-PL is responsible for antimicrobial activity against food spoilage and food-poisoning bacteria72. In addition, A. burdickii and P. vandeheii also harbor metal-dependent β-lactamase superfamily-I and III proteins, which are known for their involvement in the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics73. This enzyme family plays a significant role in conferring resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins. Furthermore, multidrug resistance efflux pumps such as the acriflavine resistance protein and Multidrug And Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) family of Multidrug Resistance (MDR) efflux pumps were found to be present in Leifsonia species and spore-formers. These efflux pumps contribute to bacterial resistance by actively pumping out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds from the cell, including antibiotics and toxic compounds, thereby reducing their intracellular concentrations and promoting bacterial survival. The acriflavin resistance protein (AcrA) is a crucial component of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, which confers resistance to acriflavin and other antimicrobial compounds. Its role in antibiotic resistance, multidrug efflux, intracellular homeostasis, biofilm formation, and potentially bacterial virulence underscores its significance in bacterial survival and adaptation. Understanding AcrA's function may aid in the development of strategies to combat antibiotic resistance and improve therapeutic approaches against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Given its involvement in antibiotic resistance and multidrug efflux, AcrA has emerged as a potential target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents74. By inhibiting the function of AcrA or other components of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, it may be possible to overcome bacterial resistance and enhance the effectiveness of existing antibiotics. Identification of fosfomycin resistance protein (fosB) in both Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes in this study is crucial for effective infection control measures and the development of strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance. It has been reported that fosB is significant due to its impact on the treatment of bacterial infections, the emergence of multidrug resistance, the potential for horizontal gene transfer, and its implications for public health75. Streptothricin acetyltransferase was present in both Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes and it was reported that streptothricin is a valuable antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against microorganisms and can help reduce crop losses and increase agricultural productivity76. Its significance extends beyond its direct antimicrobial properties, finding applications in research, agriculture, and drug development. Understanding streptothricin's mode of action and resistance mechanisms contributes to our knowledge of antibiotics and aids in the development of novel strategies to combat bacterial infections. Streptothricin has shown efficacy in agricultural practices, particularly in plant and fungal disease management76. The ribosome protection-type tetracycline resistance-related proteins, group 2, are crucial determinants of resistance to tetracycline antibiotics in both Gram-stain-negative and positive microbes77. Their ability to protect ribosomes from the inhibitory effects of tetracycline enables microbial survival and growth in the presence of the antibiotic. The presence of these proteins in spore-forming novel species during this study and not in non-spore-forming bacteria needs further research. Choloylglycine hydrolase plays a critical role in bile acid metabolism, enterohepatic circulation, and the regulation of the bile acid pool78 and predicted only in the S. highlanderae genome. Its activity influences the composition and function of the gut microbiota and has implications for host health and disease79. Understanding the significance of this enzyme provides insights into bile acid metabolism disorders80 and potential therapeutic approaches for related conditions. Multiple genes for bioremediation of toxic material, enhanced plant growth, and survival in extreme conditions are predicted in the genomes of these novel species. Except for P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT, all the other species possess the capability to perform polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism. However, P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT stands out as it can utilize glutathione as a sulfur source, due to the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2)81. Within the P. vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT strain, we identified paeninodin (60%) and bacillopaline (100%), which were originally characterized in Paenibacillus dendritiformis C45482 and Paenibacillus mucilaginosus KNP41483, respectively. Furthermore, this strain harbors a siderophore gene cluster (100%) responsible for producing the antimycobacterial agent bacillibactin84. The siderophore cluster also facilitates the conversion of iron from Fe3+ to Fe2+, which is a more usable form for the microbe and its plant host under iron-limited conditions. Siderophore synthesis gene clusters are rare in Paenibacillus species and are believed to have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer events85. Genome mining resulted in identifying key functional genes of the novel species described in this study are listed in Table 7. Among all the novel species, mining of A. burdickii genome shows metal-dependent hydrolases of the β-lactamase superfamily III (MBL-III) enzyme. The MBL-III enzymes have shown potential in bioremediation processes aimed at the degradation of environmental pollutants86. The ability of MBL-III enzymes to degrade diverse chemical compounds, including pesticides, herbicides, and aromatic compounds, makes them valuable tools in the cleanup of contaminated environments87. These MBL-III enzymes can contribute to the removal and detoxification of pollutants, reducing their impact on ecosystems. Similarly, only in the genome of A. burdickii, DNA-binding heavy metal response regulator is predicted as shown in Arthrobacter sp. H-02-388 which plays a crucial role in cellular responses to heavy metal exposure, including detoxification, metal homeostasis, stress response, and environmental adaptation. In the genome of L. virtsii, organomercurial lyase is predicted which is reported to play a crucial role in the detoxification of organomercurial compounds, contributing to the protection of organisms and ecosystems by actinobacteria88. Its significance lies in the detoxification of toxic organomercurials, environmental protection, potential applications in bioremediation, insights into enzyme mechanisms, and biotechnological applications. Understanding and harnessing the capabilities of organomercurial lyase can aid in addressing mercury pollution and developing sustainable solutions for environmental and human health challenges88. The magnesium and cobalt efflux protein (CorC) plays a significant role in maintaining metal ion homeostasis, protecting against metal toxicity, facilitating adaptation to metal-rich environments, and contributing to bacterial stress response. Its activity is important for cellular functions and can also impact antibiotic resistance. The identification of CorC in only three Leifsonia genomes during this study, while not observed in other novel species, holds significant potential for enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms employed by actinobacterial group to regulate metal ions and adapt to diverse environmental conditions. In summary, the rare microbiome is instrumental in maintaining ecosystem stability, adapting to environmental changes, facilitating ecological interactions, spurring biotechnological innovation, and bolstering conservation efforts. Investigations into, and preservation of, the rare microbiome enhance our understanding of microbial diversity and ecosystem dynamics, thereby contributing to the sustainable management of the ecosystems. Conservation strategies should consider the preservation of rare microorganisms, as their loss could precipitate cascading effects on ecosystem functioning and resilience. Our study of novel microbes and predicted bioactive compounds contributes to our understanding of the microbial ecosystem on the ISS and lays the groundwork for further investigation into the potential implications of these novel species for the health and well-being of the ISS crew, as well as future space missions. The presence of specific genes and proteins in these novel species underscores their adaptive capabilities and potential resistance mechanisms against a variety of environmental challenges, including exposure to antibiotics. A deeper understanding of the genetic composition and functional capabilities of these novel species provides valuable insights into their survival strategies and could contribute to the development of improved antimicrobial therapies and strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.Supplementary Information Supplementary Information.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.Results In this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool—deepFRI—we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.Conclusion Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.

    "introduction": "Introduction The environment of outer space, characterized by intense radiation and high vacuum, presents harsh conditions for any form of life. Despite this, microorganisms have demonstrated a remarkable adaptability to these extreme space environments. Organisms known as extremophiles, such as bacteria (e.g., Bacillus, Deinococcus species) [1, 2], fungi [3], tardigrades [4], bdelloid rotifers [5], and many others, are well-documented for their ability to survive in space conditions. As such, it is virtually impossible to prevent the transfer of microbial life to exploratory space vessels or planets [6, 7]. In addition to microorganisms potentially hitching a ride with robotic components, the microbiomes of humans also travel to space. This not only includes the microbiomes of space crew members, but also free-living microorganisms associated with cargo, science instruments, and test animals, including potential pathogens which should be considered for their potential to adapt to space conditions [8–13]. The exposure of microbes to outer space, or simulated versions of these conditions, has been extensively studied to test survival capabilities and assess the panspermia hypothesis. Over several decades, various microbial samples have been exposed to space conditions via balloons, rockets, and spacecraft as part of the pioneering experiments in astrobiology (reviewed in [14]). For example, after 18 months of exposure, Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032, a bacterium isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF), exhibited 10–40% survivability when UV was masked [1]. However, when these SAFR-032 spores were exposed to UV light (above 110 nm) and vacuum in space for 18 months, except for a few spores, there was a roughly 7-log reduction in viability. Similarly, dried Deinococcus cell pellets, particularly those 500 μm in thickness, remained viable after three years of space exposure due to a shadowing effect. Moreover, D. radiodurans after being subjected to 1-year exposure to outer space during Tanpopo mission [15], showed a collection of molecular alterations, e.g., DNA damage and oxidative stress response and accumulation of metal transporters. In a recent study, a survival of D. radiodurans exposed to near space conditions was correlated with a growth condition prior to the exposure [16]. A comparative proteomics analysis of B. pumilus SAFR-032 revealed that proteins conferring resistance traits, such as superoxide dismutase, were present in higher concentrations in the vegetative cells derived from spores exposed to space compared to ground controls. Furthermore, the first-generation spores of B. pumilus SAFR-032 resulting from space-exposed samples demonstrated increased UVC resistance (around 4000 J/m2) compared to their ground control counterparts [1]. The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed environment that houses a diverse range of microorganisms, including potential pathogens [17]. As we prepare for long-term space explorations, understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow microorganisms to survive and adapt during spaceflight is becoming increasingly important [10, 15]. Monitoring the microbial population onboard the ISS is crucial for safeguarding astronaut health and preventing contamination of both the spacecraft and its equipment [7]. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species discovered on the ISS can help identify potential pathogens and comprehend their impact on the closed habitat and crew health [7]. However, to accurately identify potential microbial threats, it is essential to maintain a current and comprehensive database of microbial genomes, detailing both their species identities and phenotypic traits. This database, continuously updated through WGS of pure cultures, is crucial for gathering genetic data and assisting in the identification of microbial threats via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Moreover, the active initiatives to characterize the cultivable microbiome of previously not sequenced space habitats contribute to decreasing the unidentified microbial ‘dark matter’ in metagenomic sequencing outcomes. Research conducted in space or using ground-based simulators has shown that microgravity conditions can alter various biological processes, including growth, morphology, gene expression, virulence, drug resistance, biofilm formation, and secondary metabolism [8–10, 12, 18]. Studies focusing on the microbiome have reported an increase in antibiotic resistance markers in astronauts’ saliva [19], although these changes were temporary and reversed upon returning to Earth. Other research has indicated that microbial isolates from space environments are differentiating themselves from their Earth-bound counterparts, showing signs of adaptation to their new environment [17, 20–23]. Interestingly, under spaceflight conditions, one species, Bacillus safensis JPL-MERTA-8-2, exhibited a 60% improvement in growth compared to its Earth-based growth [24]. This study focused on the genomic peculiarities of novel species isolated from the ISS and compared WGS of the closest relatives found in Earth environments. A thorough analysis was conducted on genes associated with DNA repair, radiation resistance, microgravity adaptation, stress responses, and metabolic changes (Fig. 1). These genes were compared to their terrestrial counterparts, and potential variations induced by space conditions were observed. The protein-coding sequences from each species pair were compared using a set of similarity metrics, unearthing potentially novel genes and clusters that might have been evolved in space. Furthermore, mutations within these sequences were rigorously analyzed, and their protein structures were predicted using in silico models. This approach illuminates the genetic adaptations undertaken in stringent conditions of the space environment. In essence, by comparing space and Earth genomes and identifying mutation patterns, a clearer insight into genetic evolution influenced by space conditions has been obtained. Fig. 1.

    "methods": "Methods Bacteria isolation, genome assembly and annotation Sample collection and bacterial isolation from ISS were performed as previously described [23, 62]. Biochemical tests were performed using a Gram-positive identification card (Vitek 2 GP ID, bioMérieux) and phenotypic fingerprint was generated through GNIII MicroPlate according to BioLog’s protocol as described elsewhere [28]. We assembled the genomes of five novel bacterial species isolated from various surfaces of the ISS (specifically strains IF8SW-P5, IIF3SC_B10, F6_8S_P_1B, F6_8S_P_2B, F6_3S_P_1C), using the SPAdes workflow [63]. Phylogenetic affiliations are as outlined in [28] and presented in Table 1. DNA extraction The ISS isolates (n = 5) were grown on R2A medium and incubated at 30 °C, for 2 to 7 days. For WGS, DNA was isolated with the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit, and WGS libraries prepared using the Illumina Nextera DNA Flex kit. Sequencing on the NovaSeq 6000 platform involved paired-end, 2 × 150 bp reads. FastQC (https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC) and fastp [64] ensured data quality. WGS reads were assembled using SPAdes [63], with genome statistics from QUAST [65] and quality checks from CheckM [66]. Species verification through fastANI [67] and fastAAI (https://github.com/cruizperez/FastAAI) confirmed identities with over 95% identity, and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) was estimated with GGDC using Formula 2 [68]. For genome synteny analysis, we used SynTracker [25]. Genome annotation Following assembly, the contigs were subjected to the  Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) [69], available at https://github.com/ncbi/pgap/wiki, in order to obtain draft genomes and proteomes. Genomes were further investigated for their functions, where all identified genes (bearing PGAP descriptions in their names) underwent homology-based annotation using eggNOG v5.0, accessible at https://github.com/eggnogdb/eggnog-mapper. Genomes of closest relatives of the ISS species (highest ANI) were also subjected to PGAP and eggNOG annotation. Proteomes with the PGAP identifiers were used as input for DeepFRI analysis [58], available on github: (https://github.com/bioinf-mcb/Metagenomic-DeepFRI/), which generated query contact map using results from mmseqs2 target database [70] search for similar protein sequences with known structures and with v 1.0 model weights. For reference database, we combined structures from Swissprot (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/download), microbiome immunity project (MIP) [71] and protein databank (PDB, https://www.rcsb.org). Next, the contact map alignment was performed to use it as input to DeepFRI’s Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and annotations without the alignment to known structures were processed with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For MQ and HQ annotation, scores higher than or equal to 0.3 (50% of prediction confidence; MQ) and 0.5 (90% of prediction confidence; HQ) were used respectively (Figs. 2-3). All annotations for ISS strains and their terrestrial relatives are provided in Supplementary Tables S2–S11. Phylogenetically close relatives from Earth for each tested species were identified using ANI (Table 1). Their genomes were annotated using DeepFRI as described above. Protein sequences from the aforementioned five species were aligned and conducted two-dimensional clustering using CD-HIT [72], available at https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit, employing a 40% similarity threshold. Genes below that threshold were considered “novel” and subjected to analysis shown in Fig. 3A–B. Annotations (GO terms) were then compared between ISS strains (Supplementary Table S12) and their terrestrial counterparts (Supplementary Table S13). Common annotations were aggregated according to clusters of orthologous genes (COG) categories [73] using go2cog mapper (https://github.com/Tomasz-Lab/go2cog). GO terms that could be assigned to more than 3 COG categories were grouped as category R—“general function prediction” (Figs. 2 and 3). Heatmaps were generated using seaborn (https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn). Venn diagrams and Upsetplot were generated using matplotlib (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). Using a knowledge-based approach, a set of genes was selected for further analysis. Protein structures were modeled using in silico structure prediction tool—AlphaFold Colab [27]—and hence obtained protein databank (PDB) format structures were aligned using Geneious Prime 2023.1.1 (Biomatters). Structures were aligned using TM-align tool [26]. Based on the predicted structure, novel functional annotation was performed using DeepFRI. All the annotation data and scripts are placed in the repository on github (https://github.com/lmszydlowski/Adaptation-of-novel-bacterial-species-isolated-from-the-International-Space-Station). Sequence alignments, functional annotations for plasmids, phage elements and biosynthetic gene clusters in the genome Sequences of selected proteins were aligned using Muscle 5.1 [74]. Clustering dendrograms were built using PhyML 3.3, [75] using LG amino acid substitution model and approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) for branch support. All contigs generated for each genome were scanned for potential plasmids using PLASme software (https://github.com/HubertTang/PLASMe), phage-related elements using PHASTER software [76, 77] and results provided in the Supplementary Tables S15–S16. Genome sequences were also processed through the AntiSMASH 7.0 software [60] to look for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Supplementary Table S14). Protein mutation and enrichment analysis To investigate the roles and processes of proteins highly enriched in bacteria from the ISS, we specifically focused on the enrichment of certain amino acids, especially proline and glycine, which belong to unique amino acid change groups. The amino acid compositions of proteins from the ISS strains were compared with those proteins found in the closest terrestrial species through global alignment methods [78]. This facilitates the identification and quantification of any shifts in the amino acid composition. These shifts were evaluated by calculating the mutation rate, which is achieved by dividing the number of amino acid substitutions in the ISS bacteria by the number of amino acid substitutions in their closest terrestrial relatives. Proteins with normalized amino acid mutation rate and Z-score above 1.96 or below − 1.96 were classified as enriched. To investigate the functions and pathways of these proteins, we utilize the g:Profiler enrichment tool (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost [79]). Custom gene sets for bacteria were created using UniProt’s [80] predicted GO term associations [81] for bacterial proteins. The tool was configured to include a minimum gene set size of 5 and a maximum of 10,000, focusing on molecular function GO terms. Shared gene sets between samples were filtered using a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05 in 1424 molecular function GO terms. Data visualization was enhanced through ete3 (https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw046) for constructing phylogenetic trees and seaborn (https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) for generating heatmaps. The phylogenetic distance between bacterial species was calculated using ’s distance calculations, with the closest terrestrial bacteria as a reference.",
    "results": "Results Comparison of different annotations and between the isolates and within pangenome context Five novel species of Gram-positive bacteria that were isolated from the ISS were analyzed. Their generic features and the results of other molecular analyses are presented in Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1. These bacteria were obtained from various flights, locations, and time periods, and are associated with different phylogenetic groups. The strain F6_3S_P_1C, which belongs to the Paenibacillus genus, has been identified as a spore-former, while the other four species were identified as non-spore-forming Actinobacteria. Through ANI and AAI analysis, we established closest Earth relatives (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Additionally, we performed synteny analysis [25] using all top ANI hits for each of the five organisms (Supplementary Table S1), but yielded no results (data not shown), thus indicating all ISS isolates are distinct species.

In total, the genomes of the novel species encompassed 1290 and 1184 shared MQ and HQ annotations (1778 all annotations, Fig. 2a, b). The majority of shared annotations were related to metabolism, followed by cellular processing and signaling and information storage and processing (Fig. 2c; all common annotations (GO terms) are detailed in Supplementary Table S12 in the Supplementary material).

B Upset plot showing common annotations (derived from DeepFRI) with different groups of interests. C Clustering all isolates’ common annotations in the form of clusters of orthologous genes (COG) categories. See the “Methods” for more detailsAnnotations unique to ISS bacterial species All curated  () genomes were used to find the closest terrestrial relatives for the novel ISS bacterial species and the genome that exhibited the highest average nucleotide identity (ANI) value was further compared with genomes of ISS strains to characterize unique annotation. When compared with their closest terrestrial relatives all ISS species have different numbers of unique annotations (Fig. 3a), which corresponds to their ANI (the higher the ANI, the fewer unique annotations). Additionally, two-dimensional Conserved Domain (CD)-hit clustering was performed between each isolate and its closest relative, using a 40% sequence similarity threshold. Thus, for each isolate a subgroup of unique genes (with no counterparts in their closest relative) was found (Supplementary Tables S2–S11). A comparison between these genes revealed the presence of 74 and 49 MQ and HQ common annotations, respectively (309 total annotations, Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table S13). Fig. 3.

Mma, Microbacterium mcarthurae (magenta); Mme, Microbacterium meiriae (orange); pLDDT, predicted local-distance difference test; pTM, predicted template modeling; TM, template modeling, see [26, 27]When aligning the novel genes in the genome context, we found the presence of potential novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in all species. These BGCs encode secondary metabolites such as terpenes, carotenes, betalactones, lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, non-ribosomal metallophores, furans, non-alpha poly-amino acids (NAPAA), type 3 polyketide synthase (T3PKS), ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPP), proteusins (Supplementary Fig. S1), Our findings of BGCs are complimentary to the previously reported BGCs in A. burdickii, L. williamsii, and P. vandeheii [28]. We also expand the BGCs classification of the studied ISS species into the “novel” category, which are not found in the genomes of their closest terrestrial relatives. In this study, we report small molecule biosynthetic pathways, metal ion transporters and other transmembrane transporters. Furthermore, transcription factors associated with environmental stress have been found (Supplementary Table S14). Given the difference in ANI for each ISS-species:closest-relative pair, a different number of novel gens was obtained in each case, proportional to the phylogenetic distance (the lower the ANI, the more novel genes were found). We therefore focused on the two Microbacteria species, as their ANI to the closest relative was higher than 98%. Using Muscle, we aligned sequences of novel genes from each species together. We found an example of novel genes (Mma_002827 and Mme_000934) being present in both species with high (52.8%) sequence similarity. Given that initial annotation (“heavy metal associated domain,” “response to copper ion,” see Supplementary Tables S2 and S6), was sequence-based (see the “Methods\" for details), another approach was assayed, with structure prediction, followed by a functional annotation. Superpositions of predicted structures (both with pTM > 0.7 and pLDDT > 80) are almost identical (Fig. 3c). The structure-based deepFRI annotations reveal that these proteins have oxidoreductase activity (acting on CH-NH2 group of donors) and that are located in the extracellular layer of the cell (Supplementary Table S15). When compared to the proteome of D. radiodurans, weak structural homology was found to extracellular protein WP_027479552.1 (TM-score 0.34, see Supplementary Fig. S2). Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as transposases were also found in all species except L. williamsii. There is also evidence of plasmid in some of the species (M. mcarthurae, M. meiriae), due to the presence of relaxosome encoding genes, such as MobC/L family relaxase (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table S16). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Heatmap representing abundance of annotations of interest in the studied species Comparison of proteome-level mutations in the ISS species and within pangenome context Several groups of proteins, important for adaptation to space environmental conditions were analyzed between ISS species and their closest Earth relatives. In metallopeptidases, the mutation rate of hydrophobic amino acids and glycine are higher than 1 in this protein group, suggesting an enrichment of these amino acids in the metallopeptidase proteins of ISS bacteria. These mutations might enhance the stability of these proteins under space environmental conditions (Fig. 4A). Glycine enrichment is a measure of how often the amino acid glycine appears in a protein sequence compared to what would be expected by chance (see the “Methods\" for more details). Significant glycine enrichment in a protein can suggest evolutionary pressures and adaptive responses to make proteins more flexible via mutation to glycine [29]. The metallopeptidase activity stands out as it exhibits consistent glycine enrichment across all strains, suggesting it may play a critical role in universal adaptive mechanisms (Fig. 4B). Other molecular functions, such as “ATP-dependent peptidase activity” and “2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase activity,” show high glycine enrichment, but only in both Microbaterium species, indicating potential taxonomy-based adaptations (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of mutation enrichment in ISS species across different protein families. A Clustering dendrogram representing enrichment in protein mutations (wrt closest relative) related to the protein group and type of mutation. B Mutation enrichment of selected proteins (wrt Uniprot database) with their significance scoresCertain molecular functions, such as “5 formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo ligase activity,” “ATP dependent peptidase activity,” and “ATP phosphoribosyltransferase activity,” display a high degree of hydrophobic amino acid enrichment, but only in M. meiriae and L. williamsii. This could suggest convergent adaptations involving changes in hydrophobicity of aforementioned proteins. Interestingly, “metallopeptidase activity” shows hydrophobic amino acid enrichment across all ISS species, albeit at a lower level than glycine enrichment. This could suggest a universal, but less dominant, adaptive strategy involving changes in protein hydrophobicity. These patterns underscore the complexity of potential adaptive strategies, highlighting the interplay between different types of amino acid changes in response to ISS environments (Fig. 4B). Metallopeptidases play role in celluar stress response [15], biofilm formation [30], as well as virulence [31] and hence are important factors in microbial adaptations to space conditions. Therefore, comparative analysis of sequences and structures of selected metallopeptidases from M. meiriae and its closest relative will be further discussed in the section below. Case studies of adaptations The functional annotations were further investigated to search for genes that would allow adaptation to life in space. The genes of interest were summarized in Fig. 5. Energy metabolism As previously reported [8–10, 12, 13, 18] metabolic rearrangements are essential part of adaptations to life in space (see overview in Fig. 1). Common annotations show the presence of genes encoding proteins related to carbohydrate, cofactors and coenzymes metabolism (Figs. 2c and 3b). Apart from genomic annotation (Supplementary Table S12), metabolic tests conducted on the ISS bacterial species reveal their ability to grow on a broad range of carbon sources, including cyclic compounds, oligo- and polysaccharides (Supplementary Fig. S3a–b). All species are capable of growing on 27 substrates being the sole carbon source, including carbohydrates (pectin, dextrin, mannose, fucose, gentibiose, lactose, melibiose, glucose, galactose, fructose as well as their branched and glycosylated derivatives), fatty acids (acetic acid, L-malic acid, sodium lactate and butyrate), amino acids (L-glutamic acid), alcohols (glycerol) and antibiotics (vancomycin and aztreonam). They can also grow at 1% NaCl concentration and pH6. Apart from the spore-forming P. vandeheii, the other bacteria can also utilize tween 40, gelatin, D-malic acid, L-lactic acid, propionic acid, D/L-serine, L-alanine, sorbitol, lincomycin, minocycline, nalidixic acid, rifamycin, as well as grow in the presence of lithium chloride. On the other hand, only P. vandeheii is able to grow in the presence of sodium bromate. Additionally to the species described by Simpson and colleagues [28], two species of Microbacterium were characterized for the first time. These species are able to utilize 72 carbon sources altogether (80 and 73 substrates for M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae, respectively), grow at 8% NaCl concentration, as well as in the presence of lithium chloride and potassium tellurite. Unlike other species, either M. mcarthurae or M. meiriae can utilize α-keto-glutaric acid and citric acid.Mechanosensitive ion channels (Msc) and osmoprotectants Except for A. burdickii, each of the studied organisms has at least one copy of mscS gene annotated. Msc proteins are known to play a crucial role in adapting cells to the osmotic pressure [32]. Overall, two variants of Msc proteins exist: large conductance (3.6 nS) MscL and small conductance (1 nS) MscS. Large conductance channels are generally conserved and present in most bacteria as well as eukaryotes, although they are not found in deep sea species, where no pressure changes occur. Conversely, MscS are diverse structurally and functionally and occur in those organisms, which exhibit hypo-osmotic stress periodically (e.g., desiccation). MscS proteins have a common core architecture but show different gating mechanisms and conductive properties. Because low gravity conditions can be viewed as decrease in osmotic pressure, leading to the hypo-osmotic stress, their presence is therefore crucial for survival in ISS. All terrestrial relatives have a copy of mscS gene with over 90% sequence similarity to their homologous gene from the ISS species (Supplementary Fig. S4), except for L. williamsii, where there is an additional copy of the mscS with no homology in the genome of Leifsonia sp. ku-ls. Nevertheless, the presence of an additional copy of mscS gene could be due to the larger phylogenetic distance, as indicated by ANI (Fig. 3A). As for the osmoprotectants, there is no commonly shared metabolite, as genes related to betaine, choline, ectoine and trehalose synthesis are not present in all five species.Redox stress Changes in osmotic pressure, as well as exposure to ionizing radiation may lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have detrimental effects on cells. From the studies on Deinococcus it was found that it has elevated intracellular concentrations of Mn as well as Fe [33]. All studied ISS strains show an elevated number of metalloproteins compared to their closest terrestrial counterparts (Supplementary Table S12). In the case of M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae, there are 27 and 25 unique metalloproteins, respectively (Supplementary Table S14), which include metallopeptidases, thioredoxins, metalloregulated transcription factors and heavy metal associated P-type ATPases. Metallopeptidases were of our special interest, as they showed certain adaptive mutations in all studied species (as described in previous section). Therefore, we decided to further analyze the metallopeptidase pair from M. meiriae and its terrestrial relative Microbacterium sp. LTR1. We found aminopeptidases in two of these species (Mme_001931 and WP_268776344.1 from M. meiriae and its terrestrial relative Microbacterium sp. LTR1, respectively), which share only 44% protein sequence similarity (58.4% nucleotide similarity, Supplementary Fig. S5). When structural models were calculated for these proteins (both with pTM-score ≫ 0.9), their superposition is almost identical (Fig. 6A), despite the low sequence similarity. When analyzing enrichment of the amino acids in Mme_001931 with WP_268776344.1 as a baseline, we observed enrichment of arginine and methionine, which were over 1.5 times more abundant compared to terrestrial protein. Opposite case was observed for lysine, which was over 2 times less abundant in ISS organism (Fig. 6B). When superimposed to deinococcal aminopeptidase (WP_0516188611), Mme_001931 exhibited similarly high TM-score (0.83), although the latter’s size is 1.81 times bigger than WP_0516188611 (Supplementary Fig. S6). In terms of amino acid enrichment, WP_051618861 also showed an elevated amount of arginines (8.3% wrt 5.5%) with subsequent decrease of lysines (1.1% wrt 2.6%) and increase in methionine with decrease of negatively charged amino acids, but also increase in glycines, histidines and prolines. Nonetheless, there is almost two times the size difference and further phylogenetic distance than in the case of M. meiriae (Supplementary Figure S6). Fig. 6.

Deinococcus radiodurans was extensively tested for its ability to protect and repair damaged DNA, which was due to its homologous recombination (HR) kit. All ISS species encode 10–14 genes related to HR, compared to 10 genes identified in D. radiodurans (Fig. 5). Similarly, all of the genomes share the set of rec, ruv, rad and uvr genes. In terms of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), all ISS strains share at least one gene. When compared with the Rec protein family from D. radiodurans and B. pumilus (Supplementary Fig. S7), clusters reflect phylogenetic distances. Moreover, all ISS strains share the LexA repressor (EC 3.4.21.88), which is part of the SOS response.Phage elements Phage elements were found in all genomes of ISS strains, with at least two phage-related genes found in each strain. Holin is a short protein containing few transmembrane regions. Although holin is usually accompanied by endolysin, there is no evidence of phage-related endolysin in any of the genome of ISS strains, suggesting that the phage elements could have been domesticated or removed. When tested with PHASTER software, prophage elements were detected only in the genome of P. vandeheii, as well as in its closest Earth relative (Supplementary Table S16).Potential pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance Common annotations (Supplementary Table S2) indicate the presence of genes with virulence potential, such as metallophores and hemolysins (including the group III family, which forms oligomeric complexes), which are present in all ISS strains. However, ISS strains often exhibit enhanced expression of these virulence genes due to the unique selective pressures of the space environment, such as microgravity and increased radiation. In contrast, Earth analogous strains show a greater diversity in these genes, driven by varied environmental challenges and human influences like antibiotic use and pollution ([34]. Genomes of all ISS bacterial species contain genes involved in biofilm formation, potentially posing a pathogenic risk to humans under specific conditions, even though these genera and their closest terrestrial relatives are not typically known to be infectious agents. Comparatively, Earth counterparts also form biofilms, but the selective pressures driving this ability differ. On Earth, biofilm formation is often a response to environmental challenges such as antibiotic exposure and surface colonization in diverse habitats. In contrast, ISS bacteria have shown adaptations favoring biofilm formation and surface interactions due to the unique conditions of the space environment, such as microgravity and limited nutrient availability [35]. Additionally, as Mora et al. highlighted in their work [36], the genomic and physiological features selected by ISS conditions, though not directly pertinent to human health, exhibit considerable adaptations for biofilm formation and surface interactions. Their research underscores the importance of minimizing local moisture to prevent the formation of potentially harmful biofilms. Metabolic assays indicate that all ISS bacterial species have the ability to degrade at least two antimicrobial compounds (Supplementary Fig. S3ab), showcasing their resilience in a controlled, high-stress environment. These bacteria also harbor various P-type translocating transportases and metallopeptidases within their pool of novel genes (Supplementary Table S12), suggesting advanced mechanisms for survival and resistance. Similarly, Earth analogs have evolved to degrade antimicrobial compounds, especially in environments heavily influenced by human activity, such as hospitals and agricultural sites [31].",
    "discussion": "Discussion The thorough examination of genomes of five novel ISS bacterial species, when compared with their closest terrestrial counterparts, unveiled clear adaptations to the rigors of ISS space environment. Notably, significant shifts in cell physiology and metabolism were seen. The extent to which genes lacked homologs in their terrestrial relatives was found to be associated with their phylogenetic distance. A specific set of genes was discovered to be present in all isolates but absent in their closest terrestrial relatives. This observation is consistent with earlier findings on the ISS-specific evolutionary patterns [37, 38]. Mannose is a known substrate of glycosylation in prokaryotes [39] and thus may play a role in cell wall modifications, cell adhesion and biofilm formation. Moreover, genes related to beta-mannosidase and mannose activities were up-regulated in high salinity media in the brine shrimp Artemia salina [40], suggesting that mannose and its derivatives may be accumulated as organic osmolytes. Clusters associated with small molecule and peptide biosynthesis in fungi were found in abundance, reaffirming earlier studies into molecular responses to microgravity [11]. The pool of novel genes unique to the ISS species (Supplementary Table S13) showed an abundance of genes related to peptide and small molecule synthesis, transmembrane secretion/transport, and mechanosensitive ion channels. This suggests they might have a defense mechanism against hypoosmotic shocks. Furthermore, novel surface oxidoreductases have been identified in M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae which are not present in their terrestrial analogs. In light of these findings, a deeper investigation using comparative transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is recommended. To perform meta-omic analysis while cultivating these microorganisms on ISS would be very challenging. Nevertheless, such studies were conducted before, e.g., Tanpopo mission [15], although this study focused on meta-omic analyses post-exposure. Conducting in vivo experiments on microogranisms could be performed via simulating some of the conditions experienced in ISS, e.g., increased radiation, vacuum or microgravity. Ground facilities to recreate these conditions exist and has been utilized in such experiments before ([41–43], also reviewed in [10]). It would therefore be possible to compare gene expression profile under these conditions, protein activity (e.g., extracellular metallopeptidases) or even assay secretion of certain metabolites (e.g., chelators, antibiotics) on indicative media. Efficient DNA repair and its impact on survival in the extreme conditions has long been studied in many organisms [41, 44, 45]. LexA repressor-mediated response is known to be crucial to DNA protection and repair process [46]. Studies on extremophilic bdelloid rotifers highlighted the linkage of efficient DNA repair mechanisms with the presence of high rates of HGT [47, 48]. The detection of MGEs underscores a significant genetic factor hinting at the selective pressures faced by species isolated from the ISS. Interestingly, the quantity of annotated transposases seems to be in proportion to genome size, with P. vandeheii genome showcasing the most substantial presence of MGEs. On the other hand, transposable elements were not detected in all ISS species, thus suggesting that TE-mediated genome rearrangements are not a common route for genomic adaptations to space environment. Given that microgravity and hypoosmotic shock may induce dessication stress, the adaptation mechanisms may be similar to dessication-tolerant organisms, e.g., bdelloid rotifers, where TEs are highly diverged [49] and containing unique ORFs, thus indicating a domestication. Hence, it is possible that in the species described in this study the TEs are significantly diverged. Extremophilic lifestyle provides selective pressure on maintaining genome integrity. Therefore, TEs disruptive activity is expected to be quenched, at least in the non-spore forming species. On the other hand, P. vandeheii may have a different adaptation system, being a spore-former (such as D. radiodurans, which is known to contain TEs that are a part of stress-response [50]). Notably, sequences tied to plasmid-specific genes, such as mobC and relaxase, were discerned in both Microbacterium species, a feature absent in their terrestrial analogs. This emphasizes the potential unique genetic adaptations of these space-borne bacteria. Building upon established research [33, 47], our analysis of proteomic alterations points to a significant enrichment across various protein classes. A particularly noteworthy observation is the global glycine enrichment, a phenomenon that aligns with findings from earlier studies on Acinetobacter sp., a desiccation-tolerant organism [17, 37, 51]. Historically, these organisms have not only displayed enhanced hydrophilicity but have also shown a fortified resistance to ionizing radiation, a stress factor intrinsically tied to redox reactions. The emphasis on these genetic mechanisms holds paramount importance, especially in the context of space-related stress factors. As organisms venture into space, they confront an array of unique and potent stressors, including elevated radiation, microgravity, and vacuum conditions. The genetic adaptability and resilience exhibited by certain organisms, as demonstrated by their proteomic profiles and specific enrichments, provide invaluable insights. These genetic mechanisms might well be the key to understanding how life can persist, and perhaps thrive, in the harsh environs of space. Such knowledge not only expands our understanding of extremophile biology but also informs potential biotechnological applications and space colonization strategies in the future. When looking at the singular case of metallopeptidase (aminopeptidase N) from M. meiriae and its closely-related Earth counterpart Microbacterium sp. LTR1, we observed almost perfect structure alignment, despite 43% sequence similarity. The changes in amino acid composition reflect the adaptations to the lifestyle of M. meiriae, with enrichment of arginine(s) and methionine(s), with the subsequent reduction of lysine and asparagine. Arginine is known to provide more stability to the structure than lysine [52–54]. Methionine in proteins plays an important role in cellular antioxidant activity, protein structure stabilization, and sequence-independent recognition of protein surfaces. It can also act as a regulatory switch through reversible oxidation and reduction (reviewed in [55]). This could hence explain its presence in the catalytic site (HEXXH motif) of aminopeptidase N. Drawing from foundational work such as that by Daly et al. [33], metalloproteins stand out as a consistently enriched protein class in strains adapted to space conditions. This enrichment pattern mirrors the remarkable adaptations seen in organisms like D. radiodurans, which has gained attention for its extraordinary radiation resistance [41]. The prominence of these metal-dependent enzymes in space-adapted strains is not merely a coincidence. These enzymes play a pivotal role in efficiently managing the redox stress that such microorganisms face in space. Their enrichment suggests an enhanced capability for early stress detection, with these enzymes acting as both environmental sensors and transcription factors. This is a vital adaptation, as space presents a plethora of unique stressors, with redox imbalances being a major concern. The ability of certain strains to bolster their defense mechanisms, as evidenced by the enrichment of specific proteins, reveals the intricate genetic adaptations that enable survival in such hostile settings. These findings not only deepen our grasp of astrobiology but also have profound implications for potential biotechnological applications, hinting at ways to engineer organisms or systems for better resilience in space or other extreme conditions. The extreme ISS environment explains the need for metals scavenging to balance the redox stress, e.g., in the form of metalloproteins. The study of metallopeptidases is essential in the context of microbial adaptation to space conditions due to their significant roles in protein degradation, regulation of biological functions, and contribution to microbial virulence and biofilm formation [30]. This research is vital for ensuring the health and safety of astronauts, maintaining the integrity of space missions, and exploring new biotechnological applications. On the other hand, the prevalence of genes such as hemolysins, ferrochelatases, as well as protein glycosylation (mannose), antibiotic resistance and biofilm pathways indicates the risk of potential pathogenicity of the ISS-inhabiting microorganisms. These genes also appear in the genomes of their closest terrestrial relatives, but more studies needed to validate whether microgravity enhance the antibiotic resistance and biofilm production [56]. Conversely, these observations highlight the importance of metal uptake systems, which could lead to the development of antimicrobial agents utilized in the space habitat. Hemolysins are known to be repressed upon high Fe concentrations, as they are tools to scavenge it from the environment. On the other hand, LexA-mediated stress response is known to initiate bacteriocin synthesis [57]. Thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161 has been detected in the ISS organism A. burdickii [28] and the presence of BGCs encoding potentially novel antimicrobial molecules in the genomes of remaining four ISS species has been confirmed. Therefore, these organisms may serve as a source of potential new antimicrobial agents available upon spaceflight. In summary, the present study underscored the benefits of deep learning-based annotations, here using DeepFRI [58], which are able to go beyond the limitations of homology-based tools like PGAP and eggNOG [59]. In fact, DeepFRI enabled the construction of a comprehensive and cohesive picture of adaptations to space conditions. Nevertheless, combined use of annotations derived from all tools was applied to, e.g., mechanosensitive ion channel proteins (see Section 2.3.2). While traditional tools often relegated these genes to the ambiguous “hypothetical” category, DeepFRI was adept at providing precise annotations. This allowed for the discernment of novel BGCs, a finding that was further corroborated using specialized tools such as antiSMASH [28, 60]. In addition, a significant portion of these novel annotations pertained to membrane-associated proteins. This resonates with prior observations highlighting membrane-related adjustments. The challenge of studying the membrane proteome cannot be understated. Yet, with the recent augmentation of databases like AlphaFold [27] and ESM atlas [61], the scientific community has been endowed with a richer repository of membrane-bound protein structures. This surge in data availability paves the way for more refined structure-based annotations of novel genomes. This deep dive into the genetic underpinnings bears profound significance, especially when contextualized within space-related stress factors. As organisms confront the multifaceted challenges of space, their genetic machinery undergoes intricate recalibrations. By harnessing sophisticated annotation tools, we gain unparalleled insights into these genetic adaptations, potentially unlocking the secrets of space resilience.

Copyright notice ID: 11451251 PMID: 39363369 Abstract Background The extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.Results In this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool—deepFRI—we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.Conclusion Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.

Despite this, microorganisms have demonstrated a remarkable adaptability to these extreme space environments. Organisms known as extremophiles, such as bacteria (e.g., Bacillus, Deinococcus species) [1, 2], fungi [3], tardigrades [4], bdelloid rotifers [5], and many others, are well-documented for their ability to survive in space conditions. As such, it is virtually impossible to prevent the transfer of microbial life to exploratory space vessels or planets [6, 7]. In addition to microorganisms potentially hitching a ride with robotic components, the microbiomes of humans also travel to space. This not only includes the microbiomes of space crew members, but also free-living microorganisms associated with cargo, science instruments, and test animals, including potential pathogens which should be considered for their potential to adapt to space conditions [8–13]. The exposure of microbes to outer space, or simulated versions of these conditions, has been extensively studied to test survival capabilities and assess the panspermia hypothesis. Over several decades, various microbial samples have been exposed to space conditions via balloons, rockets, and spacecraft as part of the pioneering experiments in astrobiology (reviewed in [14]). For example, after 18 months of exposure, Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032, a bacterium isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF), exhibited 10–40% survivability when UV was masked [1]. However, when these SAFR-032 spores were exposed to UV light (above 110 nm) and vacuum in space for 18 months, except for a few spores, there was a roughly 7-log reduction in viability. Similarly, dried Deinococcus cell pellets, particularly those 500 μm in thickness, remained viable after three years of space exposure due to a shadowing effect. Moreover, D. radiodurans after being subjected to 1-year exposure to outer space during Tanpopo mission [15], showed a collection of molecular alterations, e.g., DNA damage and oxidative stress response and accumulation of metal transporters. In a recent study, a survival of D. radiodurans exposed to near space conditions was correlated with a growth condition prior to the exposure [16]. A comparative proteomics analysis of B. pumilus SAFR-032 revealed that proteins conferring resistance traits, such as superoxide dismutase, were present in higher concentrations in the vegetative cells derived from spores exposed to space compared to ground controls. Furthermore, the first-generation spores of B. pumilus SAFR-032 resulting from space-exposed samples demonstrated increased UVC resistance (around 4000 J/m2) compared to their ground control counterparts [1]. The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed environment that houses a diverse range of microorganisms, including potential pathogens [17]. As we prepare for long-term space explorations, understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow microorganisms to survive and adapt during spaceflight is becoming increasingly important [10, 15]. Monitoring the microbial population onboard the ISS is crucial for safeguarding astronaut health and preventing contamination of both the spacecraft and its equipment [7]. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species discovered on the ISS can help identify potential pathogens and comprehend their impact on the closed habitat and crew health [7]. However, to accurately identify potential microbial threats, it is essential to maintain a current and comprehensive database of microbial genomes, detailing both their species identities and phenotypic traits. This database, continuously updated through WGS of pure cultures, is crucial for gathering genetic data and assisting in the identification of microbial threats via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Moreover, the active initiatives to characterize the cultivable microbiome of previously not sequenced space habitats contribute to decreasing the unidentified microbial ‘dark matter’ in metagenomic sequencing outcomes. Research conducted in space or using ground-based simulators has shown that microgravity conditions can alter various biological processes, including growth, morphology, gene expression, virulence, drug resistance, biofilm formation, and secondary metabolism [8–10, 12, 18]. Studies focusing on the microbiome have reported an increase in antibiotic resistance markers in astronauts’ saliva [19], although these changes were temporary and reversed upon returning to Earth. Other research has indicated that microbial isolates from space environments are differentiating themselves from their Earth-bound counterparts, showing signs of adaptation to their new environment [17, 20–23]. Interestingly, under spaceflight conditions, one species, Bacillus safensis JPL-MERTA-8-2, exhibited a 60% improvement in growth compared to its Earth-based growth [24]. This study focused on the genomic peculiarities of novel species isolated from the ISS and compared WGS of the closest relatives found in Earth environments. A thorough analysis was conducted on genes associated with DNA repair, radiation resistance, microgravity adaptation, stress responses, and metabolic changes (Fig. 1). These genes were compared to their terrestrial counterparts, and potential variations induced by space conditions were observed. The protein-coding sequences from each species pair were compared using a set of similarity metrics, unearthing potentially novel genes and clusters that might have been evolved in space. Furthermore, mutations within these sequences were rigorously analyzed, and their protein structures were predicted using in silico models. This approach illuminates the genetic adaptations undertaken in stringent conditions of the space environment. In essence, by comparing space and Earth genomes and identifying mutation patterns, a clearer insight into genetic evolution influenced by space conditions has been obtained. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Overview of the project. Scheme created with BioRender.comResults Comparison of different annotations and between the isolates and within pangenome context Five novel species of Gram-positive bacteria that were isolated from the ISS were analyzed. Their generic features and the results of other molecular analyses are presented in Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1. These bacteria were obtained from various flights, locations, and time periods, and are associated with different phylogenetic groups. The strain F6_3S_P_1C, which belongs to the Paenibacillus genus, has been identified as a spore-former, while the other four species were identified as non-spore-forming Actinobacteria. Through ANI and AAI analysis, we established closest Earth relatives (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Additionally, we performed synteny analysis [25] using all top ANI hits for each of the five organisms (Supplementary Table S1), but yielded no results (data not shown), thus indicating all ISS isolates are distinct species.

In total, the genomes of the novel species encompassed 1290 and 1184 shared MQ and HQ annotations (1778 all annotations, Fig. 2a, b). The majority of shared annotations were related to metabolism, followed by cellular processing and signaling and information storage and processing (Fig. 2c; all common annotations (GO terms) are detailed in Supplementary Table S12 in the Supplementary material). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Overview of the annotations common in all ISS species. A Number of unique, common annotations found in all species (BP, biological process; CC, cell component; EC, enzyme commission; MF, molecular function; MQ, medium quality; HQ, high quality). B Upset plot showing common annotations (derived from DeepFRI) with different groups of interests. C Clustering all isolates’ common annotations in the form of clusters of orthologous genes (COG) categories. See the “Methods” for more detailsAnnotations unique to ISS bacterial species All curated  () genomes were used to find the closest terrestrial relatives for the novel ISS bacterial species and the genome that exhibited the highest average nucleotide identity (ANI) value was further compared with genomes of ISS strains to characterize unique annotation. When compared with their closest terrestrial relatives all ISS species have different numbers of unique annotations (Fig. 3a), which corresponds to their ANI (the higher the ANI, the fewer unique annotations). Additionally, two-dimensional Conserved Domain (CD)-hit clustering was performed between each isolate and its closest relative, using a 40% sequence similarity threshold. Thus, for each isolate a subgroup of unique genes (with no counterparts in their closest relative) was found (Supplementary Tables S2–S11). A comparison between these genes revealed the presence of 74 and 49 MQ and HQ common annotations, respectively (309 total annotations, Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table S13). Fig. 3.

C Structure alignment of novel genes with 52.8% similarity found in both Microbacteria species. Mma, Microbacterium mcarthurae (magenta); Mme, Microbacterium meiriae (orange); pLDDT, predicted local-distance difference test; pTM, predicted template modeling; TM, template modeling, see [26, 27]When aligning the novel genes in the genome context, we found the presence of potential novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in all species. These BGCs encode secondary metabolites such as terpenes, carotenes, betalactones, lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, non-ribosomal metallophores, furans, non-alpha poly-amino acids (NAPAA), type 3 polyketide synthase (T3PKS), ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPP), proteusins (Supplementary Fig. S1), Our findings of BGCs are complimentary to the previously reported BGCs in A. burdickii, L. williamsii, and P. vandeheii [28]. We also expand the BGCs classification of the studied ISS species into the “novel” category, which are not found in the genomes of their closest terrestrial relatives. In this study, we report small molecule biosynthetic pathways, metal ion transporters and other transmembrane transporters. Furthermore, transcription factors associated with environmental stress have been found (Supplementary Table S14). Given the difference in ANI for each ISS-species:closest-relative pair, a different number of novel gens was obtained in each case, proportional to the phylogenetic distance (the lower the ANI, the more novel genes were found). We therefore focused on the two Microbacteria species, as their ANI to the closest relative was higher than 98%. Using Muscle, we aligned sequences of novel genes from each species together. We found an example of novel genes (Mma_002827 and Mme_000934) being present in both species with high (52.8%) sequence similarity. Given that initial annotation (“heavy metal associated domain,” “response to copper ion,” see Supplementary Tables S2 and S6), was sequence-based (see the “Methods\" for details), another approach was assayed, with structure prediction, followed by a functional annotation. Superpositions of predicted structures (both with pTM > 0.7 and pLDDT > 80) are almost identical (Fig. 3c). The structure-based deepFRI annotations reveal that these proteins have oxidoreductase activity (acting on CH-NH2 group of donors) and that are located in the extracellular layer of the cell (Supplementary Table S15). When compared to the proteome of D. radiodurans, weak structural homology was found to extracellular protein WP_027479552.1 (TM-score 0.34, see Supplementary Fig. S2). Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as transposases were also found in all species except L. williamsii. There is also evidence of plasmid in some of the species (M. mcarthurae, M. meiriae), due to the presence of relaxosome encoding genes, such as MobC/L family relaxase (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table S16). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Heatmap representing abundance of annotations of interest in the studied speciesComparison of proteome-level mutations in the ISS species and within pangenome context Several groups of proteins, important for adaptation to space environmental conditions were analyzed between ISS species and their closest Earth relatives. In metallopeptidases, the mutation rate of hydrophobic amino acids and glycine are higher than 1 in this protein group, suggesting an enrichment of these amino acids in the metallopeptidase proteins of ISS bacteria. These mutations might enhance the stability of these proteins under space environmental conditions (Fig. 4A). Glycine enrichment is a measure of how often the amino acid glycine appears in a protein sequence compared to what would be expected by chance (see the “Methods\" for more details). Significant glycine enrichment in a protein can suggest evolutionary pressures and adaptive responses to make proteins more flexible via mutation to glycine [29]. The metallopeptidase activity stands out as it exhibits consistent glycine enrichment across all strains, suggesting it may play a critical role in universal adaptive mechanisms (Fig. 4B). Other molecular functions, such as “ATP-dependent peptidase activity” and “2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase activity,” show high glycine enrichment, but only in both Microbaterium species, indicating potential taxonomy-based adaptations (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of mutation enrichment in ISS species across different protein families. A Clustering dendrogram representing enrichment in protein mutations (wrt closest relative) related to the protein group and type of mutation. B Mutation enrichment of selected proteins (wrt Uniprot database) with their significance scoresCertain molecular functions, such as “5 formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo ligase activity,” “ATP dependent peptidase activity,” and “ATP phosphoribosyltransferase activity,” display a high degree of hydrophobic amino acid enrichment, but only in M. meiriae and L. williamsii. This could suggest convergent adaptations involving changes in hydrophobicity of aforementioned proteins. Interestingly, “metallopeptidase activity” shows hydrophobic amino acid enrichment across all ISS species, albeit at a lower level than glycine enrichment. This could suggest a universal, but less dominant, adaptive strategy involving changes in protein hydrophobicity. These patterns underscore the complexity of potential adaptive strategies, highlighting the interplay between different types of amino acid changes in response to ISS environments (Fig. 4B). Metallopeptidases play role in celluar stress response [15], biofilm formation [30], as well as virulence [31] and hence are important factors in microbial adaptations to space conditions. Therefore, comparative analysis of sequences and structures of selected metallopeptidases from M. meiriae and its closest relative will be further discussed in the section below.Case studies of adaptations The functional annotations were further investigated to search for genes that would allow adaptation to life in space. The genes of interest were summarized in Fig. 5. Energy metabolism As previously reported [8–10, 12, 13, 18] metabolic rearrangements are essential part of adaptations to life in space (see overview in Fig. 1). Common annotations show the presence of genes encoding proteins related to carbohydrate, cofactors and coenzymes metabolism (Figs. 2c and 3b). Apart from genomic annotation (Supplementary Table S12), metabolic tests conducted on the ISS bacterial species reveal their ability to grow on a broad range of carbon sources, including cyclic compounds, oligo- and polysaccharides (Supplementary Fig. S3a–b). All species are capable of growing on 27 substrates being the sole carbon source, including carbohydrates (pectin, dextrin, mannose, fucose, gentibiose, lactose, melibiose, glucose, galactose, fructose as well as their branched and glycosylated derivatives), fatty acids (acetic acid, L-malic acid, sodium lactate and butyrate), amino acids (L-glutamic acid), alcohols (glycerol) and antibiotics (vancomycin and aztreonam). They can also grow at 1% NaCl concentration and pH6. Apart from the spore-forming P. vandeheii, the other bacteria can also utilize tween 40, gelatin, D-malic acid, L-lactic acid, propionic acid, D/L-serine, L-alanine, sorbitol, lincomycin, minocycline, nalidixic acid, rifamycin, as well as grow in the presence of lithium chloride. On the other hand, only P. vandeheii is able to grow in the presence of sodium bromate. Additionally to the species described by Simpson and colleagues [28], two species of Microbacterium were characterized for the first time. These species are able to utilize 72 carbon sources altogether (80 and 73 substrates for M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae, respectively), grow at 8% NaCl concentration, as well as in the presence of lithium chloride and potassium tellurite. Unlike other species, either M. mcarthurae or M. meiriae can utilize α-keto-glutaric acid and citric acid.Mechanosensitive ion channels (Msc) and osmoprotectants Except for A. burdickii, each of the studied organisms has at least one copy of mscS gene annotated. Msc proteins are known to play a crucial role in adapting cells to the osmotic pressure [32]. Overall, two variants of Msc proteins exist: large conductance (3.6 nS) MscL and small conductance (1 nS) MscS. Large conductance channels are generally conserved and present in most bacteria as well as eukaryotes, although they are not found in deep sea species, where no pressure changes occur. Conversely, MscS are diverse structurally and functionally and occur in those organisms, which exhibit hypo-osmotic stress periodically (e.g., desiccation). MscS proteins have a common core architecture but show different gating mechanisms and conductive properties. Because low gravity conditions can be viewed as decrease in osmotic pressure, leading to the hypo-osmotic stress, their presence is therefore crucial for survival in ISS. All terrestrial relatives have a copy of mscS gene with over 90% sequence similarity to their homologous gene from the ISS species (Supplementary Fig. S4), except for L. williamsii, where there is an additional copy of the mscS with no homology in the genome of Leifsonia sp. ku-ls. Nevertheless, the presence of an additional copy of mscS gene could be due to the larger phylogenetic distance, as indicated by ANI (Fig. 3A). As for the osmoprotectants, there is no commonly shared metabolite, as genes related to betaine, choline, ectoine and trehalose synthesis are not present in all five species.Redox stress Changes in osmotic pressure, as well as exposure to ionizing radiation may lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have detrimental effects on cells. From the studies on Deinococcus it was found that it has elevated intracellular concentrations of Mn as well as Fe [33]. All studied ISS strains show an elevated number of metalloproteins compared to their closest terrestrial counterparts (Supplementary Table S12). In the case of M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae, there are 27 and 25 unique metalloproteins, respectively (Supplementary Table S14), which include metallopeptidases, thioredoxins, metalloregulated transcription factors and heavy metal associated P-type ATPases. Metallopeptidases were of our special interest, as they showed certain adaptive mutations in all studied species (as described in previous section). Therefore, we decided to further analyze the metallopeptidase pair from M. meiriae and its terrestrial relative Microbacterium sp. LTR1. We found aminopeptidases in two of these species (Mme_001931 and WP_268776344.1 from M. meiriae and its terrestrial relative Microbacterium sp. LTR1, respectively), which share only 44% protein sequence similarity (58.4% nucleotide similarity, Supplementary Fig. S5). When structural models were calculated for these proteins (both with pTM-score ≫ 0.9), their superposition is almost identical (Fig. 6A), despite the low sequence similarity. When analyzing enrichment of the amino acids in Mme_001931 with WP_268776344.1 as a baseline, we observed enrichment of arginine and methionine, which were over 1.5 times more abundant compared to terrestrial protein. Opposite case was observed for lysine, which was over 2 times less abundant in ISS organism (Fig. 6B). When superimposed to deinococcal aminopeptidase (WP_0516188611), Mme_001931 exhibited similarly high TM-score (0.83), although the latter’s size is 1.81 times bigger than WP_0516188611 (Supplementary Fig. S6). In terms of amino acid enrichment, WP_051618861 also showed an elevated amount of arginines (8.3% wrt 5.5%) with subsequent decrease of lysines (1.1% wrt 2.6%) and increase in methionine with decrease of negatively charged amino acids, but also increase in glycines, histidines and prolines. Nonetheless, there is almost two times the size difference and further phylogenetic distance than in the case of M. meiriae (Supplementary Figure S6). Fig. 6.

Deinococcus radiodurans was extensively tested for its ability to protect and repair damaged DNA, which was due to its homologous recombination (HR) kit. All ISS species encode 10–14 genes related to HR, compared to 10 genes identified in D. radiodurans (Fig. 5). Similarly, all of the genomes share the set of rec, ruv, rad and uvr genes. In terms of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), all ISS strains share at least one gene. When compared with the Rec protein family from D. radiodurans and B. pumilus (Supplementary Fig. S7), clusters reflect phylogenetic distances. Moreover, all ISS strains share the LexA repressor (EC 3.4.21.88), which is part of the SOS response.Phage elements Phage elements were found in all genomes of ISS strains, with at least two phage-related genes found in each strain. Holin is a short protein containing few transmembrane regions. Although holin is usually accompanied by endolysin, there is no evidence of phage-related endolysin in any of the genome of ISS strains, suggesting that the phage elements could have been domesticated or removed. When tested with PHASTER software, prophage elements were detected only in the genome of P. vandeheii, as well as in its closest Earth relative (Supplementary Table S16).Potential pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance Common annotations (Supplementary Table S2) indicate the presence of genes with virulence potential, such as metallophores and hemolysins (including the group III family, which forms oligomeric complexes), which are present in all ISS strains. However, ISS strains often exhibit enhanced expression of these virulence genes due to the unique selective pressures of the space environment, such as microgravity and increased radiation. In contrast, Earth analogous strains show a greater diversity in these genes, driven by varied environmental challenges and human influences like antibiotic use and pollution ([34]. Genomes of all ISS bacterial species contain genes involved in biofilm formation, potentially posing a pathogenic risk to humans under specific conditions, even though these genera and their closest terrestrial relatives are not typically known to be infectious agents. Comparatively, Earth counterparts also form biofilms, but the selective pressures driving this ability differ. On Earth, biofilm formation is often a response to environmental challenges such as antibiotic exposure and surface colonization in diverse habitats. In contrast, ISS bacteria have shown adaptations favoring biofilm formation and surface interactions due to the unique conditions of the space environment, such as microgravity and limited nutrient availability [35]. Additionally, as Mora et al. highlighted in their work [36], the genomic and physiological features selected by ISS conditions, though not directly pertinent to human health, exhibit considerable adaptations for biofilm formation and surface interactions. Their research underscores the importance of minimizing local moisture to prevent the formation of potentially harmful biofilms. Metabolic assays indicate that all ISS bacterial species have the ability to degrade at least two antimicrobial compounds (Supplementary Fig. S3ab), showcasing their resilience in a controlled, high-stress environment. These bacteria also harbor various P-type translocating transportases and metallopeptidases within their pool of novel genes (Supplementary Table S12), suggesting advanced mechanisms for survival and resistance. Similarly, Earth analogs have evolved to degrade antimicrobial compounds, especially in environments heavily influenced by human activity, such as hospitals and agricultural sites [31].Discussion The thorough examination of genomes of five novel ISS bacterial species, when compared with their closest terrestrial counterparts, unveiled clear adaptations to the rigors of ISS space environment. Notably, significant shifts in cell physiology and metabolism were seen. The extent to which genes lacked homologs in their terrestrial relatives was found to be associated with their phylogenetic distance. A specific set of genes was discovered to be present in all isolates but absent in their closest terrestrial relatives. This observation is consistent with earlier findings on the ISS-specific evolutionary patterns [37, 38]. Mannose is a known substrate of glycosylation in prokaryotes [39] and thus may play a role in cell wall modifications, cell adhesion and biofilm formation. Moreover, genes related to beta-mannosidase and mannose activities were up-regulated in high salinity media in the brine shrimp Artemia salina [40], suggesting that mannose and its derivatives may be accumulated as organic osmolytes. Clusters associated with small molecule and peptide biosynthesis in fungi were found in abundance, reaffirming earlier studies into molecular responses to microgravity [11]. The pool of novel genes unique to the ISS species (Supplementary Table S13) showed an abundance of genes related to peptide and small molecule synthesis, transmembrane secretion/transport, and mechanosensitive ion channels. This suggests they might have a defense mechanism against hypoosmotic shocks. Furthermore, novel surface oxidoreductases have been identified in M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae which are not present in their terrestrial analogs. In light of these findings, a deeper investigation using comparative transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is recommended. To perform meta-omic analysis while cultivating these microorganisms on ISS would be very challenging. Nevertheless, such studies were conducted before, e.g., Tanpopo mission [15], although this study focused on meta-omic analyses post-exposure. Conducting in vivo experiments on microogranisms could be performed via simulating some of the conditions experienced in ISS, e.g., increased radiation, vacuum or microgravity. Ground facilities to recreate these conditions exist and has been utilized in such experiments before ([41–43], also reviewed in [10]). It would therefore be possible to compare gene expression profile under these conditions, protein activity (e.g., extracellular metallopeptidases) or even assay secretion of certain metabolites (e.g., chelators, antibiotics) on indicative media. Efficient DNA repair and its impact on survival in the extreme conditions has long been studied in many organisms [41, 44, 45]. LexA repressor-mediated response is known to be crucial to DNA protection and repair process [46]. Studies on extremophilic bdelloid rotifers highlighted the linkage of efficient DNA repair mechanisms with the presence of high rates of HGT [47, 48]. The detection of MGEs underscores a significant genetic factor hinting at the selective pressures faced by species isolated from the ISS. Interestingly, the quantity of annotated transposases seems to be in proportion to genome size, with P. vandeheii genome showcasing the most substantial presence of MGEs. On the other hand, transposable elements were not detected in all ISS species, thus suggesting that TE-mediated genome rearrangements are not a common route for genomic adaptations to space environment. Given that microgravity and hypoosmotic shock may induce dessication stress, the adaptation mechanisms may be similar to dessication-tolerant organisms, e.g., bdelloid rotifers, where TEs are highly diverged [49] and containing unique ORFs, thus indicating a domestication. Hence, it is possible that in the species described in this study the TEs are significantly diverged. Extremophilic lifestyle provides selective pressure on maintaining genome integrity. Therefore, TEs disruptive activity is expected to be quenched, at least in the non-spore forming species. On the other hand, P. vandeheii may have a different adaptation system, being a spore-former (such as D. radiodurans, which is known to contain TEs that are a part of stress-response [50]). Notably, sequences tied to plasmid-specific genes, such as mobC and relaxase, were discerned in both Microbacterium species, a feature absent in their terrestrial analogs. This emphasizes the potential unique genetic adaptations of these space-borne bacteria. Building upon established research [33, 47], our analysis of proteomic alterations points to a significant enrichment across various protein classes. A particularly noteworthy observation is the global glycine enrichment, a phenomenon that aligns with findings from earlier studies on Acinetobacter sp., a desiccation-tolerant organism [17, 37, 51]. Historically, these organisms have not only displayed enhanced hydrophilicity but have also shown a fortified resistance to ionizing radiation, a stress factor intrinsically tied to redox reactions. The emphasis on these genetic mechanisms holds paramount importance, especially in the context of space-related stress factors. As organisms venture into space, they confront an array of unique and potent stressors, including elevated radiation, microgravity, and vacuum conditions. The genetic adaptability and resilience exhibited by certain organisms, as demonstrated by their proteomic profiles and specific enrichments, provide invaluable insights. These genetic mechanisms might well be the key to understanding how life can persist, and perhaps thrive, in the harsh environs of space. Such knowledge not only expands our understanding of extremophile biology but also informs potential biotechnological applications and space colonization strategies in the future. When looking at the singular case of metallopeptidase (aminopeptidase N) from M. meiriae and its closely-related Earth counterpart Microbacterium sp. LTR1, we observed almost perfect structure alignment, despite 43% sequence similarity. The changes in amino acid composition reflect the adaptations to the lifestyle of M. meiriae, with enrichment of arginine(s) and methionine(s), with the subsequent reduction of lysine and asparagine. Arginine is known to provide more stability to the structure than lysine [52–54]. Methionine in proteins plays an important role in cellular antioxidant activity, protein structure stabilization, and sequence-independent recognition of protein surfaces. It can also act as a regulatory switch through reversible oxidation and reduction (reviewed in [55]). This could hence explain its presence in the catalytic site (HEXXH motif) of aminopeptidase N. Drawing from foundational work such as that by Daly et al. [33], metalloproteins stand out as a consistently enriched protein class in strains adapted to space conditions. This enrichment pattern mirrors the remarkable adaptations seen in organisms like D. radiodurans, which has gained attention for its extraordinary radiation resistance [41]. The prominence of these metal-dependent enzymes in space-adapted strains is not merely a coincidence. These enzymes play a pivotal role in efficiently managing the redox stress that such microorganisms face in space. Their enrichment suggests an enhanced capability for early stress detection, with these enzymes acting as both environmental sensors and transcription factors. This is a vital adaptation, as space presents a plethora of unique stressors, with redox imbalances being a major concern. The ability of certain strains to bolster their defense mechanisms, as evidenced by the enrichment of specific proteins, reveals the intricate genetic adaptations that enable survival in such hostile settings. These findings not only deepen our grasp of astrobiology but also have profound implications for potential biotechnological applications, hinting at ways to engineer organisms or systems for better resilience in space or other extreme conditions. The extreme ISS environment explains the need for metals scavenging to balance the redox stress, e.g., in the form of metalloproteins. The study of metallopeptidases is essential in the context of microbial adaptation to space conditions due to their significant roles in protein degradation, regulation of biological functions, and contribution to microbial virulence and biofilm formation [30]. This research is vital for ensuring the health and safety of astronauts, maintaining the integrity of space missions, and exploring new biotechnological applications. On the other hand, the prevalence of genes such as hemolysins, ferrochelatases, as well as protein glycosylation (mannose), antibiotic resistance and biofilm pathways indicates the risk of potential pathogenicity of the ISS-inhabiting microorganisms. These genes also appear in the genomes of their closest terrestrial relatives, but more studies needed to validate whether microgravity enhance the antibiotic resistance and biofilm production [56]. Conversely, these observations highlight the importance of metal uptake systems, which could lead to the development of antimicrobial agents utilized in the space habitat. Hemolysins are known to be repressed upon high Fe concentrations, as they are tools to scavenge it from the environment. On the other hand, LexA-mediated stress response is known to initiate bacteriocin synthesis [57]. Thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161 has been detected in the ISS organism A. burdickii [28] and the presence of BGCs encoding potentially novel antimicrobial molecules in the genomes of remaining four ISS species has been confirmed. Therefore, these organisms may serve as a source of potential new antimicrobial agents available upon spaceflight. In summary, the present study underscored the benefits of deep learning-based annotations, here using DeepFRI [58], which are able to go beyond the limitations of homology-based tools like PGAP and eggNOG [59]. In fact, DeepFRI enabled the construction of a comprehensive and cohesive picture of adaptations to space conditions. Nevertheless, combined use of annotations derived from all tools was applied to, e.g., mechanosensitive ion channel proteins (see Section 2.3.2). While traditional tools often relegated these genes to the ambiguous “hypothetical” category, DeepFRI was adept at providing precise annotations. This allowed for the discernment of novel BGCs, a finding that was further corroborated using specialized tools such as antiSMASH [28, 60]. In addition, a significant portion of these novel annotations pertained to membrane-associated proteins. This resonates with prior observations highlighting membrane-related adjustments. The challenge of studying the membrane proteome cannot be understated. Yet, with the recent augmentation of databases like AlphaFold [27] and ESM atlas [61], the scientific community has been endowed with a richer repository of membrane-bound protein structures. This surge in data availability paves the way for more refined structure-based annotations of novel genomes. This deep dive into the genetic underpinnings bears profound significance, especially when contextualized within space-related stress factors. As organisms confront the multifaceted challenges of space, their genetic machinery undergoes intricate recalibrations. By harnessing sophisticated annotation tools, we gain unparalleled insights into these genetic adaptations, potentially unlocking the secrets of space resilience. Such revelations not only propel our understanding of astrobiology forward but also spotlight the potential of genetic mechanisms in tailoring organisms for optimal performance in extraterrestrial environments.Methods Bacteria isolation, genome assembly and annotation Sample collection and bacterial isolation from ISS were performed as previously described [23, 62]. Biochemical tests were performed using a Gram-positive identification card (Vitek 2 GP ID, bioMérieux) and phenotypic fingerprint was generated through GNIII MicroPlate according to BioLog’s protocol as described elsewhere [28]. We assembled the genomes of five novel bacterial species isolated from various surfaces of the ISS (specifically strains IF8SW-P5, IIF3SC_B10, F6_8S_P_1B, F6_8S_P_2B, F6_3S_P_1C), using the SPAdes workflow [63]. Phylogenetic affiliations are as outlined in [28] and presented in Table 1.DNA extraction The ISS isolates (n = 5) were grown on R2A medium and incubated at 30 °C, for 2 to 7 days. For WGS, DNA was isolated with the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit, and WGS libraries prepared using the Illumina Nextera DNA Flex kit. Sequencing on the NovaSeq 6000 platform involved paired-end, 2 × 150 bp reads. FastQC (https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC) and fastp [64] ensured data quality. WGS reads were assembled using SPAdes [63], with genome statistics from QUAST [65] and quality checks from CheckM [66]. Species verification through fastANI [67] and fastAAI (https://github.com/cruizperez/FastAAI) confirmed identities with over 95% identity, and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) was estimated with GGDC using Formula 2 [68]. For genome synteny analysis, we used SynTracker [25].Genome annotation Following assembly, the contigs were subjected to the  Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) [69], available at https://github.com/ncbi/pgap/wiki, in order to obtain draft genomes and proteomes. Genomes were further investigated for their functions, where all identified genes (bearing PGAP descriptions in their names) underwent homology-based annotation using eggNOG v5.0, accessible at https://github.com/eggnogdb/eggnog-mapper. Genomes of closest relatives of the ISS species (highest ANI) were also subjected to PGAP and eggNOG annotation. Proteomes with the PGAP identifiers were used as input for DeepFRI analysis [58], available on github: (https://github.com/bioinf-mcb/Metagenomic-DeepFRI/), which generated query contact map using results from mmseqs2 target database [70] search for similar protein sequences with known structures and with v 1.0 model weights. For reference database, we combined structures from Swissprot (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/download), microbiome immunity project (MIP) [71] and protein databank (PDB, https://www.rcsb.org). Next, the contact map alignment was performed to use it as input to DeepFRI’s Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and annotations without the alignment to known structures were processed with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For MQ and HQ annotation, scores higher than or equal to 0.3 (50% of prediction confidence; MQ) and 0.5 (90% of prediction confidence; HQ) were used respectively (Figs. 2-3). All annotations for ISS strains and their terrestrial relatives are provided in Supplementary Tables S2–S11. Phylogenetically close relatives from Earth for each tested species were identified using ANI (Table 1). Their genomes were annotated using DeepFRI as described above. Protein sequences from the aforementioned five species were aligned and conducted two-dimensional clustering using CD-HIT [72], available at https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit, employing a 40% similarity threshold. Genes below that threshold were considered “novel” and subjected to analysis shown in Fig. 3A–B. Annotations (GO terms) were then compared between ISS strains (Supplementary Table S12) and their terrestrial counterparts (Supplementary Table S13). Common annotations were aggregated according to clusters of orthologous genes (COG) categories [73] using go2cog mapper (https://github.com/Tomasz-Lab/go2cog). GO terms that could be assigned to more than 3 COG categories were grouped as category R—“general function prediction” (Figs. 2 and 3). Heatmaps were generated using seaborn (https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn). Venn diagrams and Upsetplot were generated using matplotlib (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). Using a knowledge-based approach, a set of genes was selected for further analysis. Protein structures were modeled using in silico structure prediction tool—AlphaFold Colab [27]—and hence obtained protein databank (PDB) format structures were aligned using Geneious Prime 2023.1.1 (Biomatters). Structures were aligned using TM-align tool [26]. Based on the predicted structure, novel functional annotation was performed using DeepFRI. All the annotation data and scripts are placed in the repository on github (https://github.com/lmszydlowski/Adaptation-of-novel-bacterial-species-isolated-from-the-International-Space-Station).Sequence alignments, functional annotations for plasmids, phage elements and biosynthetic gene clusters in the genome Sequences of selected proteins were aligned using Muscle 5.1 [74]. Clustering dendrograms were built using PhyML 3.3, [75] using LG amino acid substitution model and approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) for branch support. All contigs generated for each genome were scanned for potential plasmids using PLASme software (https://github.com/HubertTang/PLASMe), phage-related elements using PHASTER software [76, 77] and results provided in the Supplementary Tables S15–S16. Genome sequences were also processed through the AntiSMASH 7.0 software [60] to look for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Supplementary Table S14).Protein mutation and enrichment analysis To investigate the roles and processes of proteins highly enriched in bacteria from the ISS, we specifically focused on the enrichment of certain amino acids, especially proline and glycine, which belong to unique amino acid change groups. The amino acid compositions of proteins from the ISS strains were compared with those proteins found in the closest terrestrial species through global alignment methods [78]. This facilitates the identification and quantification of any shifts in the amino acid composition. These shifts were evaluated by calculating the mutation rate, which is achieved by dividing the number of amino acid substitutions in the ISS bacteria by the number of amino acid substitutions in their closest terrestrial relatives. Proteins with normalized amino acid mutation rate and Z-score above 1.96 or below − 1.96 were classified as enriched. To investigate the functions and pathways of these proteins, we utilize the g:Profiler enrichment tool (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost [79]). Custom gene sets for bacteria were created using UniProt’s [80] predicted GO term associations [81] for bacterial proteins. The tool was configured to include a minimum gene set size of 5 and a maximum of 10,000, focusing on molecular function GO terms. Shared gene sets between samples were filtered using a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05 in 1424 molecular function GO terms. Data visualization was enhanced through ete3 (https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw046) for constructing phylogenetic trees and seaborn (https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) for generating heatmaps. The phylogenetic distance between bacterial species was calculated using ’s distance calculations, with the closest terrestrial bacteria as a reference.Supplementary Information 40168_2024_1916_MOESM1_ESM.zip (44.9MB, zip) Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 1.

    "abstract": "We have demonstrated that spatial regulation of the same product from two distinct genes generates metabolite diversity.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Filamentous fungi, such as species found within the genus Aspergillus, are well known producers of secondary metabolites (SMs) with interesting biological activities. The genome sequencing of Aspergillus species revealed that the number of putative SM genes greatly exceeds the number of identified SMs, suggesting many novel types of SMs still remain to be discovered.1 In general, these SM genes are clustered in the genome.2 A typical cluster contains one key gene required for the synthesis of the precursor skeleton. These genes usually encode large multidomain enzymes belonging to the polyketide synthase (PKS) or non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) class.3 Other adjacent genes encode enzymes that are involved in tailoring modifications, transport of the product, or co-regulation of the cluster genes.4 In a given fungal species, the SM arsenal is usually governed by the number of key synthetic genes in the genome, and this diversity is multiplied by various tailoring enzymes that give rise to a considerable number of different natural products.5 For instance, the fungus A. nidulans has 27 PKS genes, 12 NRPS genes, 14 NRPS-like genes and one PKS/NRPS hybrid gene.6 In a previous study, Ahuja et al. systematically characterized the polyketide products of eight non reducing PKSs (NR-PKSs) in A. nidulans.5 In combination with the six previously characterized NR-PKS genes, the study demonstrated that the 14 NR-PKS genes in A. nidulans could be divided into seven groups based on phylogenetic analysis. More importantly, each of these NR-PKSs produces a unique product which can be modified by other tailoring enzymes and incorporate into various SM biosynthetic pathways, indicating the potential of A. nidulans for biosynthesizing a large variety of different PKS-derived SMs.5 Recently, application of an efficient gene targeting system enabled us to link two NRPS-like genes apvA and btyA to their corresponding SMs, aspulvinones and butyrolactones, respectively, in A. terreus strain  2624.7 In this study, we demonstrated that one NRPS-like gene, atmelA, is involved in the synthesis of a brown conidial melanin in this fungus.7 Compared to typical NRPSs, NRPS-like genes encode single module (A-T-TE) proteins missing the condensation (C) domain.3,8 The adenylation (A) domain is responsible for aryl acid substrate recognition and activation. The activated substrate is loaded onto the thiolation (T) domain. The thioesterase (TE) domain is suggested to be involved in the condensation and releasing of the final product.8 Therefore, the diversity of NRPS-like products is expanded by a combination of different A domains (substrate selection and activation) and TE domains (various cyclization and release mechanisms). The A. terreus genome contains 14 NRPS-like genes with predicted A-T-TE or similar domain architecture and the SM products for the majority of these are unknown. Here we report our efforts to systematically characterize the products of these 14 NRPS-like genes. We heterologously expressed each gene in A. nidulans under the control of the inducible alcA promoter. Surprisingly, our study reveals that two NRPS-like genes, apvA and atmelA, are responsible for the formation of the same intermediate, aspulvinone E (1, Fig. 1A). The aspulvinone E produced by AtmelA is further modified by a tyrosinase, AtmelB, and is incorporated into the brown melanin biosynthesis pathway in A. terreus (Fig. 1A). In parallel, the aspulvinone E synthesized by ApvA is further prenylated by a trans-prenyltransferase (AbpB) to produce aspulvinones (Fig. 1B). AbpB also prenylates butyrolactones, and this reveals that modifying genes outside of specific clusters can be responsible for modifying compounds from more than one SM gene cluster, thus expanding the diversity of SMs produced by an organism (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1. (A) AtmelA and ApvA may synthesize the identical natural product 1 accumulated in different fungal tissues. (B) A trans-prenyltransferase, AbpB, prenylates two substrates, aspulvinones and butyrolactones. Open in a new tab Our results suggest that the promoter of apvA drives expression in hyphae resulting in the production of aspulvinone E (1), which is modified to produce aspulvinone variants. The atmelA promoter drives expression in conidia, also resulting in the production of aspulvinone E (1) but in this cell type it is converted to melanin. Further genetic analysis of apvA and atmelA indicates that these two genes may share a common ancestral gene. The gene apvA, which may result from duplication of the ancestral gene, is inserted in a genomic region consisting of genes that codes for life-essential proteins. Our study suggests an unprecedented pathway for conidial pigment biosynthesis in A. terreus that incorporates an NRPS-like product aspulvinone E (1) as its substrate (Fig. 1). Our data also demonstrated how the SM diversity can be expanded by (1) allocating the same natural product in different fungal compartments to produce molecules with different functions; (2) encoding tailoring enzyme that is capable of chemically modifying more than one type of SMs.",

In a previous study, targeted deletion of apvA depleted production of aspulvinones in A. terreus indicating that this NRPS-like gene is responsible for the biosynthesis of the aspulvinone core.7 As expected, heterologous expression of apvA results in accumulation of aspulvinone E (1) which is speculated to be the first intermediate in the aspulvinone pathway (Fig. 1 and 2A and B).7 Unexpectedly, our HE experiments revealed that AtmelA produces the same compound (Fig. 2A and B). The gene apvA is responsible for aspulvinone biosynthesis while atmelA is involved in the synthesis of the brown conidial pigment.7 The brown conidial melanin is still produced in the apvA deletant strain as shown in Fig. 3A. In contrast, deletion of atmelA generates an albino mutant that is still capable of synthesizing aspulvinones.7 Together, these data reveal that despite having the same activity (i.e. synthesis of aspulvinone E), ApvA and AtmelA function in different roles in the fungus.

The aspulvinone E (1) and its related natural products can be detected in LC/MS traces Bi, Bii, Biii, Ciii, Di, Dii, and Diii. Trace amount of 1 identified in D iii is due to the diffusion of this compound synthesized in the conidia of the mutant strain. *This metabolite is related with aspulvinones according to its UV absorption and MS spectrum. Open in a new tab Aspulvinone E occurs as a precursor in both aspulvinone and melanin pathways To test our hypothesis that the aspulvinone E is an intermediate in two different pathways, the aspulvinone pathway and melanin pathway, we wished to delete the first tailoring gene in each pathway to accumulate the precursor produced by the gene responsible for the backbone metabolite. Since we have established the genetic linkage between apvA and aspulvinones,7 we set out to identify the first tailoring enzyme, which we presumed was responsible for prenylating 1 to give 2 (Fig. 2A). However, we could not locate a prenyl transferase (PT) gene proximal to apvA.7 We then targeted each of the putative PT genes in the A. terreus genome for deletion (Fig. 4). The individual genes were knocked out using fragments created by fusion PCR.7 The SM profiles of the correct mutants were examined by LC-MS, and of the 11 different mutants, only the ATEG_01730.1Δ strain accumulated aspulvinone E (1) (Fig. 4). Unexpectedly, removal of ATEG_01730.1 leads to the accumulation of butyrolactone II (5) as well (Fig. 4). A previous study showed that the NRPS-like gene btyA is responsible for the biosynthesis of butyrolactone core.7 The expression of three genes, apvA, btyA, and abpB were also analyzed using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). (Fig. S2C†) Our data showed that these three genes are co-expressed under aspulvinone and butyrolactone producing conditions. These pieces of evidence suggest that this single PT is responsible for the prenylation of two different metabolites, aspulvinone E (1) and butyrolactone II (5). Thus, we name the gene a (aspulvinone) b (butyrolactone) p (PT) B. Fig. 4. HPLC profiles of extracts of A. terreus prenyltransferase (PT) genes deletants as detected by UV at 330 nm and 370 nm. The numbering of the peaks corresponds to the natural products shown in Fig. 2A. Compounds 3 and 4 are prenylated derivatives of compound 5. The “*” compound is an aspulvinone derivative according to its UV absorption spectrum. ATXXXXX is abbreviated for “ATEG_XXXXX.1”. Deletion of the gene ATEG_00702.1, a homolog of tdiB involved in the asterriquinone biosynthesis, was not achieved due to the unsuccessful PCR amplification of its flanking region. Open in a new tabDefinitively establishing the role of AtmelA in the synthesis of aspulvinone E (1) required additional gene deletion experiments. We first deleted the gene apvA using the direct repeat (DR) strategy10 followed by the recycling of the AfpyrG marker (Fig. S1B†). This ensures that aspulvinone E (1) identified in the later mutants is not from ApvA. However, limited information is available about the biosynthesis of the brown conidial melanin in A. terreus. Our study suggests that the melanin pathway originates from the NRPS-like product aspulvinone E (1), which is unlike the two main precursors [di-hydroxyphenylalanin (DOPA) and dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)] of currently known melanins.11 The biosynthesis of DOPA melanin starts with a tyrosine that is oxidized to either DOPA or dopaquinone (DAQ) by a tyrosinase.11 Considering that aspulvinone E (1) shares the same phenol moiety as tyrosine, we speculate that a similar tyrosinase might catalyze the hydroxylation of 1 at the ortho position to give a dihydroxylated intermediate that becomes incorporated into the brown melanin (Fig. 1). Following the cluster paradigm, we examined the genes surrounding atmelA and identified one gene ATEG_03564.1 (atmelB) that encodes a putative tyrosinase. Removal of this gene in the apvAΔ background changed the strain's phenotype: the brown melanin was no longer synthesized and the conidia became bright yellow (Fig. 3A). As expected, the yellow material is aspulvinone E (1), which accumulated in the metabolite profiles of the apvA and atmelB double deletion strain (Fig. 3B). We next deleted the gene atmelA in the double apvAΔ, atmelBΔ strain. The LC-MS profile of this triple deletion mutant shows the abrogation of the aspulvinone E (1) which had reappeared in the double mutant (Fig. 3B), in accord with our HE results that AtmelA was also capable of producing Aspulvinone E (1). Aspulvinone E (1) produced by ApvA and AtmelA accumulates in different fungal tissues Our studies indicate that ApvA and AtmelA synthesize the same product aspulvinone E (1). We next asked how the fungus is able to allocate the same chemical synthesized by different proteins into their own specific pathway without cross-interference. Previous literature reports have shown that the production of SMs and/or their precursors can be specific to both cellular organelle and fungal tissue.12,13 We speculated that the aspulvinone E (1) from the two genes might be generated in different fungal tissues. Since removal of atmelA or atmelB changes the phenotype of A. terreus conidia (Fig. 3A), it is likely that aspulvinone E (1) from AtmelA might be produced in conidia. Likewise aspulvinones, derived from 1 that is produced by ApvA, might be produced inside the hyphae and secreted into the medium. To test this hypothesis, we performed tissue-specific extraction12,13 to reinvestigate the SM profiles of the four strains ((1) wild type; (2) abpBΔ; (3) apvAΔ, atmelBΔ; (4) apvAΔ, atmelBΔ, atmelAΔ). Fungal cultures were divided into three fractions: (1) conidial (mostly conidia and minor conidiophore), (2) top layer agar (mixture of conidiophore, vegetative hyphae, minor invasive hyphae), (3) lower layer agar (mostly invasive hyphae) (Fig. 3C and D). Compared to the SM profiles of total extracts (Fig. 3B), extraction of the conidia showed the accumulation of 1 only in the apvAΔ, atmelBΔ strain (Fig. 3C), not in strains carrying abpBΔ or atmelAΔ. This result indicates that aspulvinone E (1) from AtmelA is produced in conidia. Extraction of the hyphal (mostly invasive) fraction showed the production of 1 in the abpBΔ strain and compound 2 in wild type, indicating that aspulvinone E (1) from ApvA and its derivative 2 are specifically produced in hyphae. Exchanging atmelA with apvA, under control of the atmelA promoter, restores melanin production in A. terreus Next, we asked about the molecular mechanism for regulating the tissue-specific production of 1. We first examined the expression profiling of atmelA and apvA in different tissues using Real-Time qRT-PCR (Fig. S2, see ESI† for experimental details). As expected, the gene atmelA is specifically expressed in conidia compartment (Fig. S2B†) while the gene apvA is locally expressed in hyphae (Fig. S2C†). We then probed this question by determining whether ApvA could replace AtmelA in brown melanin biosynthesis. We assumed that tailoring enzymes like AtmelB could still recognize aspulvinone E (1) generated from either ApvA or AtmelA. Another study suggests that the products of two tubulin genes, benA and tubC, are functionally interchangeable. The method they used was to disrupt benA and then put tubC under control of the benA promoter.14,15 Herein we implemented a similar strategy by replacing the coding region of atmelA with that of apvA, placing apvA under control of the atmelA promoter (atmelAp) in the apvAΔ background (Fig. S1Ci†). As shown in Fig. 5A, the mutant stain (apvAΔ, atmelA::apvA) produces brownish conidia indicating that the brown conidial pigment is produced in the mutant strain (apvAΔ, atmelA::apvA). As anticipated, the production of aspulvinones (1 or 2) were not detected (Fig. S3†). The pigment is not produced as much as in the wild type (Fig. 5A) probably because atmelAp, after all, is not the native promoter of ApvA. Quantitative analysis of their expression using Real-Time qRT-PCR reveals that the expression level of apvA, which is under the control of atmelA promoter, is lower than that of atmelA. (Fig. S2B†) This could be one of the reasons for reduced production of the conidial melanin in the mutant strain (apvAΔ, atmelA::apvA). But more importantly, our experiment shows that compound 1 from apvA can be incorporated into the melanin pathway when apvA is regulated by atmelAp. As mentioned earlier, the production of 1 from atmelA is conidia-specific. Thus, this experiment shows that the product of ApvA can also be produced inside conidia and incorporated into melanin, suggesting that the tissue specific allocation of their products may be due to cell-type specific expression of the genes atmelA and apvA under regulation of their specific promoters. Fig. 5. (A) Phenotype of the A. terreus mutant strain apvAΔ, atmelA::apvA (the A. terreus wild type is used as positive control that produces melanin, the atmelAΔ strain is used as negative control). (B) Replacing atmelA and apvA with gfp. Top column: conidia. Bottom column: hyphae. Top row: GFP. Middle row: differential interference contrast (DIC). Bottom row: merged GFP. Open in a new tab Tissue specific expression of gfp occurs when the coding sequence of gfp replaces atmelA and apvA To test our hypothesis, we generated two mutants (atmelAp-gfp, apvAp-gfp) in which the coding regions of apvA and atmelA were replaced by the green fluorescent protein coding sequence (gfp), placing gfp under control of their specific promoters (Fig. S1Cii†). Both the melanin pathway and aspulvinones biosynthetic pathways are active when A. terreus is cultivated on LCMM agar. Under this culture condition, we hypothesized that atmelAp would turn on the expression of gfp specifically inside the conidia while the gfp regulated by apvAp would display a green fluorescent signal in the hyphae. As expected, we were able to visualize localization of GFP within the conidia only in the strain carrying atmelAp-gfp but not in the parental strain (used as control) or the strain apvAp-gfp. (Fig. 5B) In comparison, hyphal localization of GFP fluorescence was observed only in strain apvAp-gfp. (Fig. 5B) Thus, the tissue specific accumulation of aspulvinone E (1) is probably due to cell-type-specific expression of the two genes apvA and atmelA.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Our study suggests that metabolite diversity can be expanded by spatial regulation of the same precursor biosynthesized by two distinct genes. Melanin plays an important role in fungal pathogenesis as well as in the protection of the producing organisms from ultraviolet radiation.11,16,17 No definite structures for melanins have been elucidated due to their large molecular weight, insolubility in aqueous or organic solvents, and heterogeneity.11 The characterized conidial melanin of most Aspergillus species belongs to the dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin class.11 Our study reports a unique and unprecedented pathway of conidial pigment biosynthesis in A. terreus that originates from the NRPS-like product aspulvinone E (1) (Fig. 1). We also identified one putative tyrosinase encoded by the gene atmelB that is involved in a tailoring modification of aspulvinone E (1) to yield the brown conidial pigment (Fig. 1). We speculate that the function of the tyrosinase, AtmelB, might resemble that of its homolog which participates in dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-melanin biosynthesis11 and catalyzes the ortho hydroxylation of the phenol moiety in the aspulvinone E (1) core (Fig. 1). It is entirely possible that other genes are involved in the polymerization of the dual hydroxylated aspulvinone E and more efforts will be needed to decipher the complete biosynthetic pathway of the brown conidial melanin in A. terreus. Compounds in the aspulvinone family have been found to have anti-influenza A viral (H1N1) activity and are potent inhibitors of firefly luciferase.18,19 The production of aspulvinones, as revealed in a previous study, is a general stress response of A. terreus.20 The biological functions of aspulvinones, and what role they play in the biology of A. terreus, remain elusive. AtmelA shares 73% sequence similarity with ApvA. We noted that there is a 63 bp sequence in atmelA, corresponding to the TE domain of AtmelA, that has strong nucleotide identity with a portion of apvA, indicating that these two genes may share a common origin (Fig. S5C†). Interestingly, homology analysis of apvA and its surrounding genes showed that apvA is inserted into a conserved genome region consisting of genes that are essential for fungal survival (Fig. S4†). It is possible that the insertion of apvA is due to the duplication and translocation of its ancestral homolog. The production of aspulvinone-type SMs by A. terreus, in response to general stress, could be related to the chromosomal location of its producing gene apvA. However, more experiments are definitely necessary to elucidate the exact role the aspulvinone-type metabolites play in the growth, survival or metabolic processes of the fungus A. terreus. Previous literature suggested that p-hydroxylphenylpyruvate (HPP), which originates from the shikimate pathway, is the biosynthetic precursor of aspulvinones.21,22 The shikimate pathway, highly conserved in bacteria, fungi, and plant species, generates carbon skeletons for the aromatic amino acids including tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine.23 HPP is proposed to be an intermediate in the conversion of prephenate to l-tyrosine in the shikimate pathway. Limited information has been reported regarding the tissue localization of HPP in fungi. Our study suggests that the distribution of HPP is not limited to certain types of fungal compartments since both the biosynthesis of brown conidial melanin and hyphae specific aspulvinones requires the presence of HPP. Our data indicate that the tissue-specific expression of apvA and atmelA are due to the promoters of the two genes. The promoter of apvA drives expression specifically in hyphae while the promoter of atmelA drives expression in conidia. There are many examples of hyphal versus spore specific gene regulation. For example, the expression of the melanin synthesis gene atmelA might regulated by spore specific transcriptional regulators as demonstrated in a recent study showing that BrlA, the transcription factor required to initiate conidiophore development in Aspergillus spp., is necessary for fumiquinazoline gene expression and product production.13 The fact that atmelAp is capable of turning on the expression of both apvA (SM gene) and the gfp (reporter gene), suggests that it might be a useful tool for directing the expression of genes specifically inside of conidia. Besides spatial regulation of the intermediate, the SM diversity can be further expanded, as shown in our study, through tailoring enzymes that are capable of modifying SMs with different chemical scaffolds. Early literature reported the enzymatic characterization of aspulvinone dimethylallyltransferase in A. terreus. This enzyme is capable of catalyzing the mono or dual prenylation of aspulvinone E (1).24 The substrate promiscuity of some PTs has also been tested in vitro by feeding experiments.25 Our study reveals the in vivo versatility of AbpB, as it accepts substrates with different chemical scaffolds. Interestingly, the three genes are dispersed in the A. terreus genome (abpB on chromosome II; apvA on chromosome III; btyA on chromosome IV), representing another deviation from the SM gene cluster paradigm. We have discovered in A. nidulans that in some cases, the corresponding PT genes are not located in the same cluster as the core PKS genes.26,27 Further comparison of the butyrolactones with aspulvinones shows that the chemical modifications after prenylation, including epoxidation and dehydrogenation, are very similar (Fig. S6†). Thus, these two natural product families may share the same set of tailoring enzymes that specifically modifies the prenyl groups attached by AbpB. Fungi are capable of producing a large variety of SMs with unique chemical scaffolds. It is usually expected that core synthetic genes, in a given species, are behind the biosynthesis of different core intermediates, as demonstrated in a study showing that all individual NRPKS in A. nidulans generate a unique PKS product.5 Phylogenetic analysis, using the protein sequences of those NRPS-like homologs obtained from the Broad Institute Aspergillus comparative database, revealed several other characterized NRPS-like homologs including TdiA (terrequinone A biosynthesis in A. nidulans),8 RalA (ralfuranone biosynthesis in Ralstonia solanacearum),28 MicA (microperfuranone biosynthesis in A. nidulans),29 AtqA (asterriquinone biosynthesis in A. terreus),7 BtyA (butyrolactone biosynthesis in A. terreus),7 and EchA (echosides biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. LZ35)30 (Fig. S5†). These NRPS-like enzymes, with A-T-TE domain architecture, fall within Clade I of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S5†). They are capable of synthesizing natural products with various chemical scaffolds using similar substrates like phenylpyruvic acid. Previous literature suggested that these pyruvic acid substrates could be produced via the shikimate pathway.21,31,32 The TE domains are proposed to catalyze various condensation, cyclization and releasing reactions to yield different chemical backbones.8 In comparison, another characterized NRPS-like protein (encoded by ATEG_03630.1), with A-T-R domain arrangement, belongs to Clade V (Fig. S5†).33 In this case, the aryl acid substrate, generated by an adjacent PKS (encoded by ATEG_03629.1), is loaded onto the A domain and is reduced to its aryl-aldehyde precursor by the R domain. Thus, SM diversity is enriched from these disparate starting points. It is also common to identify two highly homologous core synthetic genes, in different species, that produces the same precursor. For example, in the biosynthesis of the meroterpenoids austinol (A. nidulans) and terretonin (A. terreus), the two PKS genes ausA and trt4 synthesize the same intermediate 3, 5-dimethylorsellinic acid.34",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion Our work indicates that chemical diversity in SM biosynthesis can be expanded via multiple dimensions. Prior to our work, the richness of the fungal SM pool was presumed to be determined by the number of SM gene clusters while the clustered genes are associated with the biosynthesis of a distinct type of SM, with some exceptions.12,13,35 In our study, we have shown that A. terreus deploys an additional strategy to enrich its natural product pool. Although the same precursor aspulvinone E (1) is shared in two pathways (the aspulvinone pathway, a typical SM pathway and the melanin pathway, producing a self-protection pigment that might also be involved in the pathogenicity of this fungus), the tissue specific expression of their biosynthetic genes results in the production of the same compound in different fungal tissues and allows it to be modified into two different products that, we assume, confer selective advantages in the specific tissues in which they are produced. The localization of production is possibly regulated by their specific promoters, but it is entirely possible that a more complex regulatory mechanism underlies this phenomenon. This expands our insight into spatial regulation of SMs in fungi.36 More investigation into these promoters might provide a means to the cell-type-directed biosynthesis of SMs or manipulating the location of the expression of some genes responsible for products with interesting biological activities. Finally, our data demonstrate that AbpB prenylates compounds in two pathways revealing that two pathways may share the same tailoring genes. It will be of interest to determine if this characteristic is common to, and specific to, prenyl transferases.",

Copyright notice ID: 5523082 PMID: 28791090 We have demonstrated that spatial regulation of the same product from two distinct genes generates metabolite diversity.Abstract In secondary metabolite biosynthesis, core synthetic genes such as polyketide synthase genes usually encode proteins that generate various backbone precursors. These precursors are modified by other tailoring enzymes to yield a large variety of different secondary metabolites. The number of core synthesis genes in a given species correlates, therefore, with the number of types of secondary metabolites the organism can produce. In our study, heterologous expression of all the A. terreus NRPS-like genes showed that two NRPS-like proteins, encoded by atmelA and apvA, release the same natural product, aspulvinone E. In hyphae this compound is converted to aspulvinones whereas in conidia it is converted to melanin. The genes are expressed in different tissues and this spatial control is probably regulated by their own specific promoters. Comparative genomics indicates that atmelA and apvA might share a same ancestral gene and the gene apvA is located in a highly conserved region in Aspergillus species that contains genes coding for life-essential proteins. Our data reveal the first case in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in which the tissue specific production of a single compound directs it into two separate pathways, producing distinct compounds with different functions. Our data also reveal that a single trans-prenyltransferase, AbpB, prenylates two substrates, aspulvinones and butyrolactones, revealing that genes outside of contiguous secondary metabolism gene clusters can modify more than one compound thereby expanding metabolite diversity. Our study raises the possibility of incorporation of spatial, cell-type specificity in expression of secondary metabolites of biological interest and provides new insight into designing and reconstituting their biosynthetic pathways.Introduction Filamentous fungi, such as species found within the genus Aspergillus, are well known producers of secondary metabolites (SMs) with interesting biological activities. The genome sequencing of Aspergillus species revealed that the number of putative SM genes greatly exceeds the number of identified SMs, suggesting many novel types of SMs still remain to be discovered.1 In general, these SM genes are clustered in the genome.2 A typical cluster contains one key gene required for the synthesis of the precursor skeleton. These genes usually encode large multidomain enzymes belonging to the polyketide synthase (PKS) or non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) class.3 Other adjacent genes encode enzymes that are involved in tailoring modifications, transport of the product, or co-regulation of the cluster genes.4 In a given fungal species, the SM arsenal is usually governed by the number of key synthetic genes in the genome, and this diversity is multiplied by various tailoring enzymes that give rise to a considerable number of different natural products.5 For instance, the fungus A. nidulans has 27 PKS genes, 12 NRPS genes, 14 NRPS-like genes and one PKS/NRPS hybrid gene.6 In a previous study, Ahuja et al. systematically characterized the polyketide products of eight non reducing PKSs (NR-PKSs) in A. nidulans.5 In combination with the six previously characterized NR-PKS genes, the study demonstrated that the 14 NR-PKS genes in A. nidulans could be divided into seven groups based on phylogenetic analysis. More importantly, each of these NR-PKSs produces a unique product which can be modified by other tailoring enzymes and incorporate into various SM biosynthetic pathways, indicating the potential of A. nidulans for biosynthesizing a large variety of different PKS-derived SMs.5 Recently, application of an efficient gene targeting system enabled us to link two NRPS-like genes apvA and btyA to their corresponding SMs, aspulvinones and butyrolactones, respectively, in A. terreus strain  2624.7 In this study, we demonstrated that one NRPS-like gene, atmelA, is involved in the synthesis of a brown conidial melanin in this fungus.7 Compared to typical NRPSs, NRPS-like genes encode single module (A-T-TE) proteins missing the condensation (C) domain.3,8 The adenylation (A) domain is responsible for aryl acid substrate recognition and activation. The activated substrate is loaded onto the thiolation (T) domain. The thioesterase (TE) domain is suggested to be involved in the condensation and releasing of the final product.8 Therefore, the diversity of NRPS-like products is expanded by a combination of different A domains (substrate selection and activation) and TE domains (various cyclization and release mechanisms). The A. terreus genome contains 14 NRPS-like genes with predicted A-T-TE or similar domain architecture and the SM products for the majority of these are unknown. Here we report our efforts to systematically characterize the products of these 14 NRPS-like genes. We heterologously expressed each gene in A. nidulans under the control of the inducible alcA promoter. Surprisingly, our study reveals that two NRPS-like genes, apvA and atmelA, are responsible for the formation of the same intermediate, aspulvinone E (1, Fig. 1A). The aspulvinone E produced by AtmelA is further modified by a tyrosinase, AtmelB, and is incorporated into the brown melanin biosynthesis pathway in A. terreus (Fig. 1A). In parallel, the aspulvinone E synthesized by ApvA is further prenylated by a trans-prenyltransferase (AbpB) to produce aspulvinones (Fig. 1B). AbpB also prenylates butyrolactones, and this reveals that modifying genes outside of specific clusters can be responsible for modifying compounds from more than one SM gene cluster, thus expanding the diversity of SMs produced by an organism (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1. (A) AtmelA and ApvA may synthesize the identical natural product 1 accumulated in different fungal tissues. (B) A trans-prenyltransferase, AbpB, prenylates two substrates, aspulvinones and butyrolactones. Open in a new tabOur results suggest that the promoter of apvA drives expression in hyphae resulting in the production of aspulvinone E (1), which is modified to produce aspulvinone variants. The atmelA promoter drives expression in conidia, also resulting in the production of aspulvinone E (1) but in this cell type it is converted to melanin. Further genetic analysis of apvA and atmelA indicates that these two genes may share a common ancestral gene. The gene apvA, which may result from duplication of the ancestral gene, is inserted in a genomic region consisting of genes that codes for life-essential proteins. Our study suggests an unprecedented pathway for conidial pigment biosynthesis in A. terreus that incorporates an NRPS-like product aspulvinone E (1) as its substrate (Fig. 1). Our data also demonstrated how the SM diversity can be expanded by (1) allocating the same natural product in different fungal compartments to produce molecules with different functions; (2) encoding tailoring enzyme that is capable of chemically modifying more than one type of SMs.Results Heterologous expression of the NRPS-like genes apvA and atmelA in A. nidulans both result in aspulvinone E production Using a recently reported efficient heterologous expression (HE) system in A. nidulans,9 the individual NRPS-like genes identified in the A. terreus genome were expressed at either the wA or yA locus of A. nidulans under regulation of the inducible alcA promoter (Fig. S1A†). In a previous study, targeted deletion of apvA depleted production of aspulvinones in A. terreus indicating that this NRPS-like gene is responsible for the biosynthesis of the aspulvinone core.7 As expected, heterologous expression of apvA results in accumulation of aspulvinone E (1) which is speculated to be the first intermediate in the aspulvinone pathway (Fig. 1 and 2A and B).7 Unexpectedly, our HE experiments revealed that AtmelA produces the same compound (Fig. 2A and B). The gene apvA is responsible for aspulvinone biosynthesis while atmelA is involved in the synthesis of the brown conidial pigment.7 The brown conidial melanin is still produced in the apvA deletant strain as shown in Fig. 3A. In contrast, deletion of atmelA generates an albino mutant that is still capable of synthesizing aspulvinones.7 Together, these data reveal that despite having the same activity (i.e. synthesis of aspulvinone E), ApvA and AtmelA function in different roles in the fungus.

Total extracts (B), conidial extracts (C) and hyphal extracts (D) of A. terreus wild type and mutant strains as detected by UV at 370 nm. Aspulvinone related natural products are labeled in red. In B–D, the black box represents the top layer agar as described in tissue-specific extraction. The green box represents the bottom layer agar in tissue-specific extraction. The numbering of the peaks corresponds to the natural products shown in Fig. 2A. The aspulvinone E (1) and its related natural products can be detected in LC/MS traces Bi, Bii, Biii, Ciii, Di, Dii, and Diii. Trace amount of 1 identified in D iii is due to the diffusion of this compound synthesized in the conidia of the mutant strain. *This metabolite is related with aspulvinones according to its UV absorption and MS spectrum. Open in a new tabAspulvinone E occurs as a precursor in both aspulvinone and melanin pathways To test our hypothesis that the aspulvinone E is an intermediate in two different pathways, the aspulvinone pathway and melanin pathway, we wished to delete the first tailoring gene in each pathway to accumulate the precursor produced by the gene responsible for the backbone metabolite. Since we have established the genetic linkage between apvA and aspulvinones,7 we set out to identify the first tailoring enzyme, which we presumed was responsible for prenylating 1 to give 2 (Fig. 2A). However, we could not locate a prenyl transferase (PT) gene proximal to apvA.7 We then targeted each of the putative PT genes in the A. terreus genome for deletion (Fig. 4). The individual genes were knocked out using fragments created by fusion PCR.7 The SM profiles of the correct mutants were examined by LC-MS, and of the 11 different mutants, only the ATEG_01730.1Δ strain accumulated aspulvinone E (1) (Fig. 4). Unexpectedly, removal of ATEG_01730.1 leads to the accumulation of butyrolactone II (5) as well (Fig. 4). A previous study showed that the NRPS-like gene btyA is responsible for the biosynthesis of butyrolactone core.7 The expression of three genes, apvA, btyA, and abpB were also analyzed using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). (Fig. S2C†) Our data showed that these three genes are co-expressed under aspulvinone and butyrolactone producing conditions. These pieces of evidence suggest that this single PT is responsible for the prenylation of two different metabolites, aspulvinone E (1) and butyrolactone II (5). Thus, we name the gene a (aspulvinone) b (butyrolactone) p (PT) B. Fig. 4. HPLC profiles of extracts of A. terreus prenyltransferase (PT) genes deletants as detected by UV at 330 nm and 370 nm. The numbering of the peaks corresponds to the natural products shown in Fig. 2A. Compounds 3 and 4 are prenylated derivatives of compound 5. The “*” compound is an aspulvinone derivative according to its UV absorption spectrum. ATXXXXX is abbreviated for “ATEG_XXXXX.1”. Deletion of the gene ATEG_00702.1, a homolog of tdiB involved in the asterriquinone biosynthesis, was not achieved due to the unsuccessful PCR amplification of its flanking region. Open in a new tabDefinitively establishing the role of AtmelA in the synthesis of aspulvinone E (1) required additional gene deletion experiments. We first deleted the gene apvA using the direct repeat (DR) strategy10 followed by the recycling of the AfpyrG marker (Fig. S1B†). This ensures that aspulvinone E (1) identified in the later mutants is not from ApvA. However, limited information is available about the biosynthesis of the brown conidial melanin in A. terreus. Our study suggests that the melanin pathway originates from the NRPS-like product aspulvinone E (1), which is unlike the two main precursors [di-hydroxyphenylalanin (DOPA) and dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)] of currently known melanins.11 The biosynthesis of DOPA melanin starts with a tyrosine that is oxidized to either DOPA or dopaquinone (DAQ) by a tyrosinase.11 Considering that aspulvinone E (1) shares the same phenol moiety as tyrosine, we speculate that a similar tyrosinase might catalyze the hydroxylation of 1 at the ortho position to give a dihydroxylated intermediate that becomes incorporated into the brown melanin (Fig. 1). Following the cluster paradigm, we examined the genes surrounding atmelA and identified one gene ATEG_03564.1 (atmelB) that encodes a putative tyrosinase. Removal of this gene in the apvAΔ background changed the strain's phenotype: the brown melanin was no longer synthesized and the conidia became bright yellow (Fig. 3A). As expected, the yellow material is aspulvinone E (1), which accumulated in the metabolite profiles of the apvA and atmelB double deletion strain (Fig. 3B). We next deleted the gene atmelA in the double apvAΔ, atmelBΔ strain. The LC-MS profile of this triple deletion mutant shows the abrogation of the aspulvinone E (1) which had reappeared in the double mutant (Fig. 3B), in accord with our HE results that AtmelA was also capable of producing Aspulvinone E (1).Aspulvinone E (1) produced by ApvA and AtmelA accumulates in different fungal tissues Our studies indicate that ApvA and AtmelA synthesize the same product aspulvinone E (1). We next asked how the fungus is able to allocate the same chemical synthesized by different proteins into their own specific pathway without cross-interference. Previous literature reports have shown that the production of SMs and/or their precursors can be specific to both cellular organelle and fungal tissue.12,13 We speculated that the aspulvinone E (1) from the two genes might be generated in different fungal tissues. Since removal of atmelA or atmelB changes the phenotype of A. terreus conidia (Fig. 3A), it is likely that aspulvinone E (1) from AtmelA might be produced in conidia. Likewise aspulvinones, derived from 1 that is produced by ApvA, might be produced inside the hyphae and secreted into the medium. To test this hypothesis, we performed tissue-specific extraction12,13 to reinvestigate the SM profiles of the four strains ((1) wild type; (2) abpBΔ; (3) apvAΔ, atmelBΔ; (4) apvAΔ, atmelBΔ, atmelAΔ). Fungal cultures were divided into three fractions: (1) conidial (mostly conidia and minor conidiophore), (2) top layer agar (mixture of conidiophore, vegetative hyphae, minor invasive hyphae), (3) lower layer agar (mostly invasive hyphae) (Fig. 3C and D). Compared to the SM profiles of total extracts (Fig. 3B), extraction of the conidia showed the accumulation of 1 only in the apvAΔ, atmelBΔ strain (Fig. 3C), not in strains carrying abpBΔ or atmelAΔ. This result indicates that aspulvinone E (1) from AtmelA is produced in conidia. Extraction of the hyphal (mostly invasive) fraction showed the production of 1 in the abpBΔ strain and compound 2 in wild type, indicating that aspulvinone E (1) from ApvA and its derivative 2 are specifically produced in hyphae.Exchanging atmelA with apvA, under control of the atmelA promoter, restores melanin production in A. terreus Next, we asked about the molecular mechanism for regulating the tissue-specific production of 1. We first examined the expression profiling of atmelA and apvA in different tissues using Real-Time qRT-PCR (Fig. S2, see ESI† for experimental details). As expected, the gene atmelA is specifically expressed in conidia compartment (Fig. S2B†) while the gene apvA is locally expressed in hyphae (Fig. S2C†). We then probed this question by determining whether ApvA could replace AtmelA in brown melanin biosynthesis. We assumed that tailoring enzymes like AtmelB could still recognize aspulvinone E (1) generated from either ApvA or AtmelA. Another study suggests that the products of two tubulin genes, benA and tubC, are functionally interchangeable. The method they used was to disrupt benA and then put tubC under control of the benA promoter.14,15 Herein we implemented a similar strategy by replacing the coding region of atmelA with that of apvA, placing apvA under control of the atmelA promoter (atmelAp) in the apvAΔ background (Fig. S1Ci†). As shown in Fig. 5A, the mutant stain (apvAΔ, atmelA::apvA) produces brownish conidia indicating that the brown conidial pigment is produced in the mutant strain (apvAΔ, atmelA::apvA). As anticipated, the production of aspulvinones (1 or 2) were not detected (Fig. S3†). The pigment is not produced as much as in the wild type (Fig. 5A) probably because atmelAp, after all, is not the native promoter of ApvA. Quantitative analysis of their expression using Real-Time qRT-PCR reveals that the expression level of apvA, which is under the control of atmelA promoter, is lower than that of atmelA. (Fig. S2B†) This could be one of the reasons for reduced production of the conidial melanin in the mutant strain (apvAΔ, atmelA::apvA). But more importantly, our experiment shows that compound 1 from apvA can be incorporated into the melanin pathway when apvA is regulated by atmelAp. As mentioned earlier, the production of 1 from atmelA is conidia-specific. Thus, this experiment shows that the product of ApvA can also be produced inside conidia and incorporated into melanin, suggesting that the tissue specific allocation of their products may be due to cell-type specific expression of the genes atmelA and apvA under regulation of their specific promoters. Fig. 5. (A) Phenotype of the A. terreus mutant strain apvAΔ, atmelA::apvA (the A. terreus wild type is used as positive control that produces melanin, the atmelAΔ strain is used as negative control). (B) Replacing atmelA and apvA with gfp. Top column: conidia. Bottom column: hyphae. Top row: GFP. Middle row: differential interference contrast (DIC). Bottom row: merged GFP. Open in a new tabTissue specific expression of gfp occurs when the coding sequence of gfp replaces atmelA and apvA To test our hypothesis, we generated two mutants (atmelAp-gfp, apvAp-gfp) in which the coding regions of apvA and atmelA were replaced by the green fluorescent protein coding sequence (gfp), placing gfp under control of their specific promoters (Fig. S1Cii†). Both the melanin pathway and aspulvinones biosynthetic pathways are active when A. terreus is cultivated on LCMM agar. Under this culture condition, we hypothesized that atmelAp would turn on the expression of gfp specifically inside the conidia while the gfp regulated by apvAp would display a green fluorescent signal in the hyphae. As expected, we were able to visualize localization of GFP within the conidia only in the strain carrying atmelAp-gfp but not in the parental strain (used as control) or the strain apvAp-gfp. (Fig. 5B) In comparison, hyphal localization of GFP fluorescence was observed only in strain apvAp-gfp. (Fig. 5B) Thus, the tissue specific accumulation of aspulvinone E (1) is probably due to cell-type-specific expression of the two genes apvA and atmelA.Discussion Our study suggests that metabolite diversity can be expanded by spatial regulation of the same precursor biosynthesized by two distinct genes. Melanin plays an important role in fungal pathogenesis as well as in the protection of the producing organisms from ultraviolet radiation.11,16,17 No definite structures for melanins have been elucidated due to their large molecular weight, insolubility in aqueous or organic solvents, and heterogeneity.11 The characterized conidial melanin of most Aspergillus species belongs to the dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin class.11 Our study reports a unique and unprecedented pathway of conidial pigment biosynthesis in A. terreus that originates from the NRPS-like product aspulvinone E (1) (Fig. 1). We also identified one putative tyrosinase encoded by the gene atmelB that is involved in a tailoring modification of aspulvinone E (1) to yield the brown conidial pigment (Fig. 1). We speculate that the function of the tyrosinase, AtmelB, might resemble that of its homolog which participates in dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-melanin biosynthesis11 and catalyzes the ortho hydroxylation of the phenol moiety in the aspulvinone E (1) core (Fig. 1). It is entirely possible that other genes are involved in the polymerization of the dual hydroxylated aspulvinone E and more efforts will be needed to decipher the complete biosynthetic pathway of the brown conidial melanin in A. terreus. Compounds in the aspulvinone family have been found to have anti-influenza A viral (H1N1) activity and are potent inhibitors of firefly luciferase.18,19 The production of aspulvinones, as revealed in a previous study, is a general stress response of A. terreus.20 The biological functions of aspulvinones, and what role they play in the biology of A. terreus, remain elusive. AtmelA shares 73% sequence similarity with ApvA. We noted that there is a 63 bp sequence in atmelA, corresponding to the TE domain of AtmelA, that has strong nucleotide identity with a portion of apvA, indicating that these two genes may share a common origin (Fig. S5C†). Interestingly, homology analysis of apvA and its surrounding genes showed that apvA is inserted into a conserved genome region consisting of genes that are essential for fungal survival (Fig. S4†). It is possible that the insertion of apvA is due to the duplication and translocation of its ancestral homolog. The production of aspulvinone-type SMs by A. terreus, in response to general stress, could be related to the chromosomal location of its producing gene apvA. However, more experiments are definitely necessary to elucidate the exact role the aspulvinone-type metabolites play in the growth, survival or metabolic processes of the fungus A. terreus. Previous literature suggested that p-hydroxylphenylpyruvate (HPP), which originates from the shikimate pathway, is the biosynthetic precursor of aspulvinones.21,22 The shikimate pathway, highly conserved in bacteria, fungi, and plant species, generates carbon skeletons for the aromatic amino acids including tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine.23 HPP is proposed to be an intermediate in the conversion of prephenate to l-tyrosine in the shikimate pathway. Limited information has been reported regarding the tissue localization of HPP in fungi. Our study suggests that the distribution of HPP is not limited to certain types of fungal compartments since both the biosynthesis of brown conidial melanin and hyphae specific aspulvinones requires the presence of HPP. Our data indicate that the tissue-specific expression of apvA and atmelA are due to the promoters of the two genes. The promoter of apvA drives expression specifically in hyphae while the promoter of atmelA drives expression in conidia. There are many examples of hyphal versus spore specific gene regulation. For example, the expression of the melanin synthesis gene atmelA might regulated by spore specific transcriptional regulators as demonstrated in a recent study showing that BrlA, the transcription factor required to initiate conidiophore development in Aspergillus spp., is necessary for fumiquinazoline gene expression and product production.13 The fact that atmelAp is capable of turning on the expression of both apvA (SM gene) and the gfp (reporter gene), suggests that it might be a useful tool for directing the expression of genes specifically inside of conidia. Besides spatial regulation of the intermediate, the SM diversity can be further expanded, as shown in our study, through tailoring enzymes that are capable of modifying SMs with different chemical scaffolds. Early literature reported the enzymatic characterization of aspulvinone dimethylallyltransferase in A. terreus. This enzyme is capable of catalyzing the mono or dual prenylation of aspulvinone E (1).24 The substrate promiscuity of some PTs has also been tested in vitro by feeding experiments.25 Our study reveals the in vivo versatility of AbpB, as it accepts substrates with different chemical scaffolds. Interestingly, the three genes are dispersed in the A. terreus genome (abpB on chromosome II; apvA on chromosome III; btyA on chromosome IV), representing another deviation from the SM gene cluster paradigm. We have discovered in A. nidulans that in some cases, the corresponding PT genes are not located in the same cluster as the core PKS genes.26,27 Further comparison of the butyrolactones with aspulvinones shows that the chemical modifications after prenylation, including epoxidation and dehydrogenation, are very similar (Fig. S6†). Thus, these two natural product families may share the same set of tailoring enzymes that specifically modifies the prenyl groups attached by AbpB. Fungi are capable of producing a large variety of SMs with unique chemical scaffolds. It is usually expected that core synthetic genes, in a given species, are behind the biosynthesis of different core intermediates, as demonstrated in a study showing that all individual NRPKS in A. nidulans generate a unique PKS product.5 Phylogenetic analysis, using the protein sequences of those NRPS-like homologs obtained from the Broad Institute Aspergillus comparative database, revealed several other characterized NRPS-like homologs including TdiA (terrequinone A biosynthesis in A. nidulans),8 RalA (ralfuranone biosynthesis in Ralstonia solanacearum),28 MicA (microperfuranone biosynthesis in A. nidulans),29 AtqA (asterriquinone biosynthesis in A. terreus),7 BtyA (butyrolactone biosynthesis in A. terreus),7 and EchA (echosides biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. LZ35)30 (Fig. S5†). These NRPS-like enzymes, with A-T-TE domain architecture, fall within Clade I of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S5†). They are capable of synthesizing natural products with various chemical scaffolds using similar substrates like phenylpyruvic acid. Previous literature suggested that these pyruvic acid substrates could be produced via the shikimate pathway.21,31,32 The TE domains are proposed to catalyze various condensation, cyclization and releasing reactions to yield different chemical backbones.8 In comparison, another characterized NRPS-like protein (encoded by ATEG_03630.1), with A-T-R domain arrangement, belongs to Clade V (Fig. S5†).33 In this case, the aryl acid substrate, generated by an adjacent PKS (encoded by ATEG_03629.1), is loaded onto the A domain and is reduced to its aryl-aldehyde precursor by the R domain. Thus, SM diversity is enriched from these disparate starting points. It is also common to identify two highly homologous core synthetic genes, in different species, that produces the same precursor. For example, in the biosynthesis of the meroterpenoids austinol (A. nidulans) and terretonin (A. terreus), the two PKS genes ausA and trt4 synthesize the same intermediate 3, 5-dimethylorsellinic acid.34 Conclusion Our work indicates that chemical diversity in SM biosynthesis can be expanded via multiple dimensions. Prior to our work, the richness of the fungal SM pool was presumed to be determined by the number of SM gene clusters while the clustered genes are associated with the biosynthesis of a distinct type of SM, with some exceptions.12,13,35 In our study, we have shown that A. terreus deploys an additional strategy to enrich its natural product pool. Although the same precursor aspulvinone E (1) is shared in two pathways (the aspulvinone pathway, a typical SM pathway and the melanin pathway, producing a self-protection pigment that might also be involved in the pathogenicity of this fungus), the tissue specific expression of their biosynthetic genes results in the production of the same compound in different fungal tissues and allows it to be modified into two different products that, we assume, confer selective advantages in the specific tissues in which they are produced. The localization of production is possibly regulated by their specific promoters, but it is entirely possible that a more complex regulatory mechanism underlies this phenomenon. This expands our insight into spatial regulation of SMs in fungi.36 More investigation into these promoters might provide a means to the cell-type-directed biosynthesis of SMs or manipulating the location of the expression of some genes responsible for products with interesting biological activities. Finally, our data demonstrate that AbpB prenylates compounds in two pathways revealing that two pathways may share the same tailoring genes. It will be of interest to determine if this characteristic is common to, and specific to, prenyl transferases.Materials and methods Strains and molecular manipulations Primers used in this study are listed in Table S1.† The fungal strains used in this study are listed in Table S2.† The scheme for heterologously expressing the NRPS-like genes of A. terreus in A. nidulans is shown in Fig. S1.† The direct repeat (DR) deletion and AfpyG marker recycling experimental design is shown in Fig. S1.† The construction of fusion PCR products, protoplast generation, and transformation were carried out as previously described.7,9 The scheme of diagnostic PCR is shown in Fig. S8.† For real time qRT-PCR, the A. terreus wild type strain and the mutant strain (apvAΔ, atmelA::apvA) were cultivated on LCMM agar for mRNA extraction from conidia. The A. terreus wild type strain was cultivated in LCMM liquid broth for mRNA extraction from hyphae. Total mRNA was extracted by using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit. The cDNA was made from the equal amount of mRNA. The expression of every gene was analyzed with the ABI 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (see ESI for experimental details†).Fermentation and LC-MS analysis (1) A. nidulans strain LO4389 and other HE mutant strains were cultivated at 37 °C in 50 ml LMM liquid medium (6 g l–1 NaNO3, 0.52 g l–1 KCl, 0.52 g l–1 MgSO4·7H2O, 1.52 g l–1 KH2PO4, 20 g l–1 lactose supplemented with 1 ml l–1 of trace element solution) at 1 × 106 spore per ml per 125 ml flask with shaking at 180 rpm. The nutrients uridine, uracil, pyridoxine and riboflavin were supplemented if necessary. As previously reported,9 44 μl (10 mM) cyclopentanone was added into the medium after 18 h of incubation. The incubator temperature was then changed to 30 °C and the culture medium was collected 72 h after cyclopentanone induction. The medium was filtrated and extracted twice with ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 50 ml). Preparation of the HPLC-MS samples and the condition for MS analysis were as previously described.7 (2) For the prenyltransferase screening experiment, A. terreus  2624 and the mutant strains were point inoculated at 30 °C on LCMM agar plates (6 g l–1 NaNO3, 0.52 g l–1 KCl, 0.52 g l–1 MgSO4·7H2O, 1.52 g l–1 KH2PO4, 10 g l–1 d-glucose, 20 g l–1 lactose, 15 g l–1 agar supplemented with 1 ml l–1 of trace element solution) per plate (D = 10 cm). After 5 days, agar was chopped into small pieces and extracted with 50 ml MeOH followed by 60 ml 1 : 1 CH2Cl2/MeOH. The extract was evaporated in vacuo to yield a water residue, which was suspended in 25 ml H2O and partitioned with 25 ml EtOAc, twice. Preparation of the HPLC-MS samples and the condition for MS analysis were the same as previously described.7 (3) For the extraction of different fungal tissues for aspulvinone production, the procedure was similar to a previously reported procedure.12,13 Plates containing 20 ml LCMM agar (1.5% agar) were overlaid with another 10 ml of LCMM agar (0.75% agar). Plates were point inoculated with wild type or the DR mutant strains and grown at 30 °C for 4 days. Conidia were harvested by adding 7 ml salt solution (8.5 g l–1 NaCl) followed by gently scraping with a sterile spreader. The conidial solution was inspected under the microscope to be largely free of hyphae and conidiophores. The conidial fraction was sonicated for 1 h and extracted twice with an equal volume of EtOAc. The top layer was then washed with 10 ml sterile water twice and removed with a sterile spatula. The bottom agar layer was then chopped into small pieces and extracted as previously described. Preparation of the HPLC-MS samples from different tissues and the conditions for MS analysis were as previously described.7 Isolation of secondary metabolites For scale up, A. nidulans HE strains were cultivated at 37 °C in 1 liter LMM liquid medium (∼100 ml per flask) at 1 × 106 spores per ml with shaking at 180 rpm. The nutrients uridine, uracil, pyridoxine and riboflavin were supplemented if necessary. To induce expression, 88 μl cyclopentanone was added into the medium after 18 h of incubation. The incubator temperature was then changed to 30 °C and the culture medium was collected 72 h after cyclopentanone induction. The medium was filtrated and extracted three times with equal volume of EtOAc. The combined EtOAc layers were evaporated to a crude extract. Further purification of fractions with targeted compounds was carried out by gradient HPLC on a C18 reverse phase column [Phenomenex Luna 5 μm C18, 250 × 10 mm] with a flow rate of 5.0 ml min–1 and measured by a UV detector at 254 nm.Fluorescence microscopy The wild type and two mutant strains (atmelAp-gfp, apvAp-gfp) were cultivated on the two-layer agar plates as mentioned. Plates were point inoculated with wild type or the mutant strains and grown at 30 °C for 5 days. The conidia were collected as previously described and the conidial solution was diluted 10 times with sterile water. A 10 μl portion of the diluted solution was placed on a pre-cleaned microscope slide and covered with a coverslip. For imaging of the hyphal GFP fluorescence signal, the top layer was removed as previously described. A small portion of hyphae containing agar (<10 μl) was placed on a pre-cleaned microscope slide and covered with a coverslip. All the samples were examined under an optical microscope to confirm that the conidia and hyphae could be clearly visualized. Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta NLO (Thornwood, NY) confocal imaging system equipped with Argon, red HeNe, and green HeNe lasers and a Coherent Chameleon Ti–Sapphire laser mounted on a vibration-free table.Acknowledgments We thank Dr James F.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Filamentous fungi, including those within the Aspergillus genus, are known to produce a vast array of secondary metabolites (SMs) that exhibit a broad range of biological activities. SMs are organic small molecules that confer selective advantage to the organism despite not being directly required for survival. In nature, SMs function as weapons to eliminate neighboring competition, chemical signals in microbial cell communication, agents of symbiosis and transportation, sexual hormones, or differentiation effectors.1 However, SMs also possess various characteristics that make them great drug candidates, which has resulted in their extensive use in the pharmaceutical industry. For example, they exhibit enormous structural and chemical diversity due to the enzymatic nature of their biosynthesis, in which the core backbone of the SM is often biosynthesized by either a polyketide synthase (PKS), which can be either non-reducing (NR-PKS) or highly-reducing (HR-PKS), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), a PKS–NRPS hybrid, a dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase (DMATS), or a terpene cyclase (TC). The carbon skeleton is then further diversified by various tailoring enzymes encoded by genes that are usually clustered in the genome with the SM core backbone gene.2 Tailoring enzymes may include oxidoreductases, oxygenases, dehydrogenases, reductases, and transferases. This process facilitates many reactions that are not possible synthetically and therefore SMs often feature more chiral centers and increased steric complexity than synthetic molecules. Further, because SMs have evolved within a biological setting, they usually possess many favorable drug-like properties. SMs currently represent a significant source of antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, anti-infective, anticancer, and antidiabetic drugs.3 Notable examples include the antibiotic penicillin, the cholesterol-lowering statin lovastatin, the antitumor agent paclitaxel,4 and the immunosuppressant cyclosporine.5 Additionally, the majority of small-molecule drugs introduced between 1981 and 2010 were either SMs, SM derivatives, SM mimics, or possessed a SM pharmacophore, and approximately 49% of all anticancer drugs are SMs or were inspired by SMs.3 Genome sequencing of Aspergillus species has greatly illuminated the potential for further drug discovery within the Aspergillus genus, revealing that the number of predicted SM biosynthetic genes or gene clusters considerably exceeds the number of identified SMs. A primary reason for this is that the majority of genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions.6 This is a logical phenomenon given the natural functions of SMs, as laboratory culture conditions lack the life-threatening or competitive circumstances likely to trigger SM production. Expression of these genes sometimes requires exposure to a specific condition or stressful environment, and therefore culturing fungi in various conditions can result in the production of different SMs.7 Other times, genetic engineering techniques, such as heterologous expression or the use of inducible promoters, are required. Since the sequencing of the first Aspergillus genome in 2005,8 researchers have used bioinformatics to identify and characterize the SM biosynthetic gene clusters present in various species of Aspergillus.9 There have been considerable efforts to activate silent clusters and link them to their downstream products, as genome mining these “cryptic” pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery.10 Further, linking known therapeutically-relevant SMs to their biosynthesis genes facilitates genetic manipulation efforts to optimize product yields of first-generation compounds and engineer second-generation compounds. In 2012, a comprehensive review depicting the status Aspergillus SM research was published by J. F. Sanchez et al.11 Building on this previous work, this review examines advances made in Aspergillus SM genome mining efforts since 2012. Specifically, it focuses on progress made within the species of Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus, which are distinguished for their significant use in research, medicine, and biotechnology. The well-characterized fungus A. nidulans has been extensively used as a model organism to study genetics and cell biology. Additionally, the development of A. nidulans “clean background” strains, which are lacking production of common SMs, combined with the availability of regulatable promoters and several genetic selection markers have facilitated its wide use as a heterologous expression host.12 The common airborne pathogen A. fumigatus threatens immunocompromised individuals and is responsible for most invasive aspergillosis infections, although infections can also be caused by A. flavus, A. terreus, A. niger, and A. nidulans.13,14 Nevertheless, A. fumigatus is known to produce biologically useful SMs, including fumitremorgin C, which exhibits potent activity against the breast cancer resistance protein.15 Melanized A. niger is used extensively in the biotechnology industry for production of citric acid and enzymes.16 Additionally, it produces an array of therapeutically relevant SMs, including the antimicrobial aurasperone A,17 the antioxidant and antifungal aurasperone B,18 the human cancer cytotoxic agent bicoumanigrin A,19 and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A.20A. terreus is used for biotechnological production of the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin21,22 and the industrial polymer precursor itaconic acid.23,24",

    "conclusion": "7. Conclusion In the post-genomic era, fungal sequencing initiatives have accelerated our ability to link SMs to their biosynthetic gene clusters. Further, they have enhanced our understanding of fungal SM biosynthetic processes and the underpinning genes that define them. Such knowledge can have enormous applications for pharmaceutical production and industrial processes, as genetic engineering can be used to optimize SM production levels or to generate useful second-generation analogs. Despite the significant progress made in the past six years, many SMs that Aspergillus species have the capacity to produce still have not been identified or linked to their biosynthetic gene clusters, which remains true for many other fungal species. Thorough characterization of the Aspergillus secondary metabolome will require a combination of approaches, including the use of inducible promoters, overexpression of pathway-specific regulators, growth in various conditions, heterologous expression, and gene knockout techniques, along with the collaborative effort of the research community.",

Specifically, it focuses on progress made within the species of Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus, which are distinguished for their significant use in research, medicine, and biotechnology.

The status of genome mining Aspergillus secondary metabolites The overall status of linking predicted SM core backbone synthase enzymes to their downstream products in A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, A. niger, and A. terreus is summarized in Table 1. Of the 66 predicted core synthase enzymes in the A. nidulans genome, 29 (43.9%) have been linked to downstream SM products. Similarly, of the 40 predicted SM core synthase enzyme-encoding genes in A. fumigatus, 19 (47.5%) have been linked to downstream SM products. While the A. niger and A. terreus genomes contains 99 and 74 predicted SM synthase enzymes, only 14 (14.1%) and 20 (27.0%) have been linked to their products, respectively. Tables 2–5 list the predicted SM core synthase genes and linked cluster products in A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, A. niger, and A. terreus, respectively. The following sections review the specific advances made in the genetic characterization and biosynthetic pathway elucidation of SMs produced by these four species in the past six years (2012–2018). It is important to note that the levels of details that have been clarified for these pathways varies quite significantly, as some pathways have been proposed with considerable detail while others involve sole characterization of the core synthase enzyme.

Genetic characterization of secondary metabolites in Aspergillus nidulans 3.1. Biosynthesis of ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene The silent SM gene cluster of the novel diterpene ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene was activated through overexpression of the Zn(ii)2Cys6 transcription factor PbcR present in the cluster.25 This led to high up-regulation of 7 adjacent genes encoding a diterpene synthase, a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, a HMG-CoA reductase, a translation elongation factor, a short-chain dehydrogenase, a hypothetical protein with partial similarity to methyltransferase, and a cytochrome P450, as well as the production of ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene. Based on this information, the biosynthesis of ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene was proposed to involve HMG-CoA reductase AN1593 to generate mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase AN1592 to generate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (Scheme 1). Next, the diterpene synthase AN1594 was proposed to catalyze two cyclization reactions to generate ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene through a ent-copalyl diphosphate intermediate. Scheme 1.

Biosynthesis of asperniduglene A1 The asperniduglenes were discovered upon activation of the sdg gene cluster in A. nidulans, which harbors genes with similarity to the citreoviridin (ctv) gene cluster in A. terreus.26 Interestingly, despite the similarity of the cluster to the ctv cluster, the asperniduglenes fall into a different class of compounds than citreoviridin. The cluster was activated by replacing the promoters of genes within the sdg cluster with the inducible alcA promoter. Large-scale cultivation and examination of SMs and intermediates produced by mutant strains enabled the biosynthetic pathway of asperniduglene A1 to be proposed (Scheme 2). First, the polyketide product is biosynthesized by the HR-PKS SdgA, followed by epoxidation by SdgC, and subsequent ketone formation via Meinwald rearrangement, likely catalyzed by SdgF. Next, SdgC catalyzes a second epoxidation on the last olefin, followed by stereospecific cyclization and hydrolytic cleavage, both of which may be catalyzed by SdgD, to form asperniduglene A1. Scheme 2. Biosynthesis of asperniduglene A1 in A. nidulans.26. Open in a new tab3.3. Biosynthesis of aspernidine A The biosynthetic gene cluster of aspernidine A, which has exhibited antiproliferative activity against tumor cell lines,27 was identified following construction of a genome-wide kinase knockout library in A. nidulans.28 Screening of the library, which consisted of 98 deletion strains, revealed that deficiency of the mitogen-activated protein kinase MpkA resulted in the production of aspernidines A and C. Structural analysis indicated that aspernidines A and C are likely derived from orsellinaldehyde, which suggested the involvement of the NR-PKS PkfA in their biosynthesis.29 Individual deletion of genes within the pkf cluster in the mpkA-genetic background strain resulted in the discovery of related compounds aspernidines D and E and allowed a biosynthetic pathway for aspernidine A to be partially proposed (Scheme 3). Following biosynthesis by PkfA, orsellinaldehyde undergoes O-methylation, hydroxylation, and prenylation to yield aspernidine D, which is likely catalyzed, in part, by the prenyltransferase PkfE. Aspernidine D is then hydroxylated by cytochrome P450 PkfB to form aspernidine E, which is oxidized by PkfF to generate a dialdehyde intermediate that is subsequently transformed to aspernidine A in a manner that has not been fully clarified yet.

Biosynthesis of microperfuranone To investigate SMs produced by NRPS-like genes, scientists replaced the native promoters of the 13 predicted NRPS-like genes in A. nidulans with the inducible alcA promoter.30 Induction of NRPS-like MicA resulted in enhanced production of microperfuranone, which has previously been isolated from Anixiella micropertusa and Emericella nidulans.31,32 Heterologous expression of micA in A. niger confirmed that MicA is solely responsible for the biosynthesis of microperfuranone, which was proposed to involve the joining of two units of phenylpyruvic acid via an aldol condensation reaction while tethered to MicA (Scheme 4). Next, the tethered intermediate undergoes sulfur-mediated cyclization to yield a furan ring, followed by decarboxylation and keto–enol tautomerization to form microperfuranone. Scheme 4. Biosynthesis of microperfuranone in A. nidulans.30. Open in a new tab3.5. Biosynthesis of fellutamide B Fellutamide B, which was originally isolated from Penicillium fellutanum, is a potent proteasome inhibitor that also induces nerve growth factor release.33 In the past decade proteasome inhibitors have emerged as effective anticancer agents, with several second-generation proteasome inhibitors currently being tested in clinical settings.34–36 To identify biosynthetic gene clusters that may be involved in the production of proteasome inhibitors, researchers searched for potential resistance genes harbored within SM gene clusters in A. nidulans.37 Interestingly, they found that within the inp cluster, inpE encoded a putative proteasome component, which has no obvious role in SM biosynthesis. The silent inp cluster was activated by replacing the promoters of six genes within the cluster with the inducible promoter alcA, which revealed that fellutamide B is the SM cluster's final product. The fellutamide B biosynthetic gene cluster contains two NRPS genes, a predicted fatty-acyl-AMP ligase, a NRPS product release/transfer protein, a transporter, and inpE, which was found to confer resistance to internally produced fellutamide B.37 Biosynthesis of fellutamide B was proposed to involve initial activation of 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid by IncP to form 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-AMP, which undergoes addition of l-Asn and l-Gln while tethered to InpB, followed by addition of l-Leu while tethered to InpA (Scheme 5). The product is then released to yield fellutamide B. Scheme 5. Biosynthesis of fellutamide B in A. nidulans.37. Open in a new tab3.6. Biosynthesis cichorine Culturing of A. nidulans on yeast extract sucrose (YES) led to the production of cichorine, which is a phytotoxin that possesses activity against corn, soybeans, and knapweed.38,39 The cichorine biosynthetic gene cluster was identified using targeted individual gene deletions, revealing that the gene cluster consisted of NR-PKS-encoding pkbA, regulatory protein-encoding cicD, transporter-encoding cicA, and four tailing protein-encoding genes.38 Analysis of extracts produced by deletion strains enabled some insights into the cichorine biosynthetic pathway (Scheme 6), which involves initial production of 3-methyl-orsellinic acid by the PKS PkbA, which undergoes a ring-closing transformation by CicB and/or CicH, followed by phenol group methylation by CicE to yield nidulol. The remaining steps in cichorine biosynthesis involve a lactone to lactam conversion carried genes found outside the cic SM gene cluster, perhaps by genes within a different cluster, such as the case with xanthone and terpene biosynthesis in A. nidulans.40,41 Scheme 6.

Biosynthesis aspercryptin Researchers generated a “genetic dereplication” strain, which is deficient in production of most A. nidulans SMs, including sterigmatocystin,42 the emericellamides,43 asperfurnanone,44 the prenyl xanthones,40 terrequinone,45 F9775A and B,46 asperthecin,47 austinol,41 and dehydroaustinol.41 The clean SM background facilitated the detection of a novel SM, designated as aspercryptin.48 The structure of aspercryptin indicated that it is biosynthesized by a NRPS pathway and involves the incorporation of six amino acids, including threonine, isoleucine, aspartic acid/asparagine, serine, lysine-like, and one unidentified amino acid. NRPS enzymes feature adenylation domains responsible for the correct identification and incorporation of amino acid monomers during SM biosynthesis. Often times, each adenylation domain present within an NRPS is responsible for the incorporation of a different amino acid.49 Therefore, scientists searched for an NRPS containing six adenylation domains in silico, which revealed NRPS-encoding AN7884. Microarray expression array data had previously revealed that AN7884 was co-regulated with 13 adjacent genes, including genes encoding for a short chain dehydrogenase, a cytochrome P450 hydroxylase, a fatty acid synthase, amino acid aminotransferase, and transporters. Targeted gene deletions confirmed the involvement of these genes in the biosynthesis of aspercryptin, which were designated as atnA–atnN, and evaluation of biosynthetic intermediates in deletion strains facilitated the elucidation of the aspercryptin biosynthetic pathway (Scheme 7). Interestingly, the proposed pathway uses cichorine as a precursor, which was confirmed by deleting the NR-PKS involved in cichorine biosynthesis, which eliminated production of aspercryptin.

Biosynthesis of felinone A To search for negative regulators of secondary metabolism, researchers generated auxotrophic mutants by replacing the coding sequences of target SM core synthase enzymes with the A. fumigatus riboB gene (AfriboB).50 Thus, when the target SM cluster is inactive, the fungus will not be able to survive without media supplementation of riboflavin. The strain was then mutagenized with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (NQO), which causes base-pair substitutions, and subsequent growth without riboflavin enabled the detection of strains in which the induced mutations resulted in SM cluster activation. This technique enabled the identification of the transcription factor mcrA. Investigation of SM production in mutant strains lacking and overexpressing mcrA revealed that it is a negative regulator of at least ten SM clusters in A. nidulans. Additionally, large-scale cultivation of the mcrA-deletion strain enabled the isolation of the antibiotic felinone A.51 Examination of the structure of felinone A, combined with products previously reported to be produced by the dba cluster,29,52 enabled the biosynthetic pathway for felinone A to be proposed (Scheme 8). The pathway involves generation of the polyketide product by the NR-PKS DbaI, followed by dearomatization via hydroxylation by the FAD-binding monooxygenase DbaH. The final steps of the pathway include a ring closure to generate an azaphilone ring system followed by several reductive steps that have not been clarified yet. Scheme 8.

Biosynthesis 4′-methoxyviridicatin Quinolone alkaloids are a class of SMs that exhibit a broad range of medicinally relevant characteristics, including antibiotic, antiviral, antimalarial, and antitumor activities.53 A 6,6-quinolone scaffold is present in a variety of quinolone alkaloids, including 4′-methoxyviridicatin and structurally similar viridicatin, which exhibits strong activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.54 To elucidate the biosynthetic nature of this class of compounds, a silent candidate cluster containing genes encoding an NRPS, a prenyltransferase, terpene cyclases, and redox enzymes was activated through overexpression of the NRPS AsqK.55 A combination of in vivo and in vitro assays were conducted to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of 4′-methoxyviridicatin (Scheme 9). The proposed pathway involves an anthranilic acid and O-methyl-l-tyrosine precursor, which undergo conversion to 4′-methoxycyclopeptin by NRPS AsqK. Next, the dioxygenase AsqJ catalyzes two distinct oxidation reactions, the first being a desaturation reaction to form a double bond and yield 4′-methoxydehydrocyclopeptine, followed by monooxygenation of that double bond to form an epoxide and yield (–)-4′-methoxycyclopenine. Interestingly, this epoxide formation then facilitates subsequent non-enzymatic rearrangement to form the 6,6-quinolone viridiatin scaffold from the 6,7-bicyclic core of (–)-4′-methoxycyclopenine, yielding 4′-methoxyviridicatin.

Biosynthesis of grey-brown conidiophore pigment Fungal pigments have a wide range of beneficial properties, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities, and can act as natural alternatives to chemically synthesized colorants.56 Historically, the NRPS IvoA and the phenol oxidase IvoB were known to be involved in grey-brown condidiophore pigment production,57 although its biosynthetic pathway had not been fully elucidated. Additionally, microarray expression data had revealed that the gene adjacent to ivoA, ivoC, was coregulated with ivoA.58 Researchers therefore replaced the native promoters of ivoA, ivoB, and ivoC with the inducible promoter alcA, which resulted in hyphal accumulation of dark pigments.59 The biosynthetic pathway was reconstructed in a stepwise manner to assign functions to each involved gene, revealing that IvoA is the first NRPS known to acetylate tryptophan, leading to N-acetyltryptophan. IvoC is then responsible for 6-hydroxylation of N-tryptophan, followed by subsequent oxidation by IvoB to yield grey-brown conidiophore pigment (Scheme 10). Scheme 10.

Biosynthesis of (+)-asperlin The SM (+)-asperlin, whose production has been reported in A. nidulans, Aspergillus caespitosus, and Aspergillus versicolor, possesses antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activity.60–64 The biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for (+)-asperlin production was recently identified in A. nidulans using a novel cluster activation method that features the use of a hybrid transcription factor,65 as previous attempts to activate this cluster through overexpression of the cluster's transcription factor were unsuccessful.29 Up-regulation of the hybrid transcription factor, which featured the DNA-binding domain of the cluster's native transcription factor fused to the activation domain of the asperfuranone gene cluster transcription factor AfoA, led to production of (+)-asperlin. Targeted gene deletions in combination with RNA-seq confirmed the involvement of 10 genes in the biosynthesis of (+)-asperlin, which were designated as alnA–alnI and alnR. Additionally, (2Z,4Z,6E)-octa-2,4,6-trienoic acid, which exhibits photoprotectant properties,66 was identified as a biosynthetic pathway intermediate (Scheme 11). The individual steps involved in the biosynthesis of (+)-asperlin remain to be fully elucidated. Scheme 11. Biosynthesis of (+)-asperlin in A. nidulans.65. Open in a new tab4. Genetic characterization of secondary metabolites in Aspergillus fumigatus 4.1. Biosynthesis of hexadehydroastechrome The positive global regulator of secondary metabolism LaeA has been shown to also play a major role in positive regulation of virulence genes in A. fumigatus.67 One way that LaeA alters virulence is through up-regulation of SM gene clusters responsible for biosynthesis of toxins, such as the epipolythiodioxopiperazine gliotoxin.13,68 To search for other SM virulence factors in A. fumigatus, scientists reasoned that such SMs would be up-regulated by both LaeA and exposure to host/hypoxia environments. Microarrays were compared to identify gene clusters that exhibited down-regulation in laeA-deletion strains and up-regulation in response to host exposure/hypoxia.69–72 Such comparison revealed the identification of the has eight-gene cluster, harboring genes encoding the NRPS HasD, the DMATS HasE, two C6 transcription factors HasA and HasF, the transporter HasB, the O-methyltransferase HasC, the FAD binding protein HasG, and the cytochrome P450 HasH.73 C6 transcription factors commonly regulate expression of genes within a SM cluster and hasA was highly down-regulated in the laeA-mutant strain. Researchers therefore overexpressed hasA by replacing its promoter with the constitutive gdpA promoter, which led to activation of the has gene cluster and production of the Fe(iii) complex hexadehydroastechrome. Interestingly, activation of the has cluster enhanced the virulence of A. fumigatus, significantly decreasing the survival of infected mice.73 To investigate the biosynthetic pathway of hexadehydroastechrome, individual gene knockout mutants were generated for hasB–hasE in the OE::hasA genetic background strain. Biosynthesis of hexadehydroastechrome initiates by loading the NRPS HasD with l-tryptophan and l-alanine, followed by prenylation of the Trp-Ala-dipeptide (Scheme 12). The subsequent biosynthetic tailoring reactions performed by HasH, HasC, and HasG were proposed to occur while the intermediate remains tethered to the NRPS. Next, the NRPS releases a O-methylated diketopiperazine derivative, which then forms a trimeric complex with Fe(iii). Scheme 12. Biosynthesis of hexadehydroastechrome in A. fumigatus.73. Open in a new tab4.2. Biosynthesis of endocrocin The anthraquinone endocrocin has been isolated from a broad range of species, including various fungi,74,75 plants,76 and insects.77 Historically, anthraquinones have been known to display various medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antitumor bioactivities, and have been used in dyes, cosmetics, paper manufacturing, and as food additives.76,78,79 However, more recently endocrocin was found to contribute to the pathogenicity of A. fumigatus through inhibition of neutrophil recruitment.80 Interestingly, endocrocin was found to be biosynthesized through two distinct routes by physically discrete clusters enc and tpc in A. fumigatus.81,82 Biosynthesis by the enc cluster was initially reported in A. fumigatus CEA10-derived strains,81 which did not produce trypacidin due to a single nucleotide mutation present in PKS-encoding tpcC.83 To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of endocrocin in A. fumigatus, the genome was surveyed for a candidate NR-PKS. Endocrocin was previously identified as a biosynthetic intermediate of monodictyphenone that was only produced in strains lacking the activity of the decarboxylase MdpH.84 Bioinformatics were therefore used to search for proteins with similarity to the monodictyphenone-producing NR-PKS MdpG in A. nidulans, which revealed the identification of three NR-PKS genes within the A. fumigatus genome. The biosynthetic gene clusters of two of the NR-PKSs suggested a final product more complex than endocrocin, so researchers focused on the third NR-PKS, which they named EncA. The NR-PKS EncA lacked the thioesterase (TE) or Claisen cyclase (CLC) domain that is usually responsible for releasing the nascent polyketide product in this class of enzymes.85,86 In such TE-less enzymes, the polyketide product is instead released by metallo-β-lactamase-type thioesterases enzymes.87 To confirm involvement of EncA in the biosynthesis of endocrocin, a encA-mutant was generated, which resulted in a strain deficient in endocrocin production.81 Subsequent deletion of tailoring genes revealed the involvement of the metallo-β-lactamase domain protein EncB and the anthrone oxidase EncC in endocrocin biosynthesis, which enabled its biosynthetic pathway to be proposed (Scheme 13). Surprisingly, deletion of the cluster gene encD resulted in increased production of endocrocin, which could have occurred for two reasons: EncD may catalyze the formation of an unknown product from endocrocin or EncD may inhibit endocrocin biosynthesis by converting an intermediate to an unknown product.81 Scheme 13. Biosynthesis of endocrocin in A. fumigatus.81. Open in a new tabRedundant biosynthesis of endocrocin by the tpc cluster was later revealed upon elucidation of the trypacidin biosynthetic pathway in A. fumigatus strain Af293, which will be discussed more thoroughly in the following section.82 To investigate any interrelationships between endocrocin and trypacidin, encA was deletion in the trypacidin-producing Af293 strain. In contrast to the previous study conducted in CEA10-derived strains with an inactive tpc cluster, deletion of encA did not result in complete loss of endocrocin production, although production yields decreased.81,82 Subsequent generation of a mutant strain deficient in both encA and tpcA resulted in a complete loss of endocrocin production. To further investigate the biosynthesis of endocrocin by tpc-encoded enzymes, genes within the tpc cluster were individually deleted in the encA-background, which revealed a second pathway for endocrocin biosynthesis in A. fumigatus (Scheme 13). Endocrocin is likely a shunt product of the trypacidin biosynthesis, as the beginning pathway steps both involve the production of atrochrysone carboxylic acid from TpcC and TpcB, which then undergoes a loss of H2O to yield endocrocin anthrone. Formation of endocrocin is then catalyzed by TpcL.4.3. Biosynthesis of trypacidin The spore metabolite trypacidin, which was initially identified as an anti-protozoal agent,88,89 was more recently shown to be cytotoxic against human lung cells.90 A candidate cluster for trypacidin biosynthesis was identified as a cluster harboring the TE-less NR-PKS TpcC,82 which belongs to the same NR-PKS clade as the endocrocin PKS in A. fumigatus,81 the monodicyphenone PKS in A. nidulans,84 and the geodin PKS in A. terreus.91 The 13 genes within the cluster, 12 of which displayed high sequence homology to the geodin-producing cluster,91 were individually deleted and mutant strains were analyzed for the production of pathway intermediates,82 which enabled proposal of the trypacidin biosynthetic pathway (Scheme 14). The first few steps are identical to that of endocrocin biosynthesis, with the generation of atrochrysone carboxylic acid from NR-PKS TpcC and metallo-β-lactamase TpcB. TpcK then catalyzes decarboxylation to yield atrochrysone, which then undergoes dehydration to yield emodin anthrone. The anthrone oxygenase TpcL catalyzes the addition of a ketone functional group to yield emodin, followed by activity of the O-methyltransferase TpcA to yield questin. The remaining steps in the pathway were proposed based on comparison to similar pathways, and involve a ring opening catalyzed by TpcG, TpcI, and TpcF, followed by O-methylation by both TpcM and TpcH to generate monomethylsulochrin, which is then converted to trypacidin by TpcJ. Scheme 14. Biosynthesis of trypacidin in A. fumigatus.82. Open in a new tab4.4. Biosynthesis of helvolic acid Fusidane-type antibiotics are a class of fungi-derived triterpenes that include helvolic acid,92 fusidic acid,93 and cephalosporin P1,94 all which display potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria.95 Structurally, they have a characteristic tetracyclic core that is generated from enzymatic cyclization of (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene.96 Notably, fusidane-type antibiotics have exhibited no cross-resistance to commonly used antibiotics,97,98 which has drawn the attention of scientists to search for analogs with increased bioactivity.99 Researchers therefore investigated the full biosynthetic pathway of helvolic acid, as such understanding can facilitate the development of useful fusidane-type antibiotic derivatives. A portion of genes within the helvolic-acid-producing hel cluster had previously been identified. To further characterize the cluster, its nine genes were heterologously introduced stepwise in Aspergillus oryzae, which resulted in the production and of helvolic acid and 21 derivatives, three of which exhibited increased antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus when compared to helvolic acid.100 A biosynthetic pathway was proposed for helvolic acid (Scheme 15), which involves initial cyclization of (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene by oxidosqualene cyclase HelA to yield protosta-17(20)Z,24-dien-3β-ol. The intermediate then undergoes two rounds of oxidation by HelB1 and HelB2, followed by acetylation by HelD2, oxidation by HelB4, and oxidative decarboxylation by HelC. Next, HelB3 mediates two oxidative reactions which result in hydroxyl and ketone formation, followed by O-acetylation by HelD1, and dehydrogenation by HelE to yield helvolic acid. Interestingly, this study revealed unique roles for HelB1 and HelC, which work together to remove the C-4β methyl group through oxidation followed by decarboxylation, a mechanism distinct from the similar demethylation reaction that occurs during sterol biosynthesis. Scheme 15. Biosynthesis of helvolic acid in A. fumigatus.100. Open in a new tab4.5. Biosynthesis of fumipyrrole A. fumigatus is capable of surviving in a myriad of distinct niches, ranging from the human lung, where it can cause invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals, to decaying vegetation, where it plays important roles in breaking down organic matter.101 The capacity to readily survive in different habitats, which correlates with pathogenicity in physiological environments, is largely dependent on the ability to sense external stimuli and respond with different signal transduction cascades, including the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway.102 To explore the targets of the cAMP/PKA pathway, the catalytic subunit 1 of PKA was overexpressed, which resulted in induction of the pathway and differential expression of various genes, including high up-regulation of the transcription factor fmpR, which is harbored in a SM gene cluster.103 To identify the SM produced by this cluster, fmpR was overexpressed using the Tet-on system,104 which led to activation of six other cluster genes encoding the NRPS FmpE, the fructosyl amino acid oxidase FmpA, hypothetical proteins FmpB and FmpC, ABC multidrug transporter FmpD, and the phenol-2-monooxygenase FmpF. The product produced by this biosynthetic gene cluster was identified as the novel SM fumipyrrole (Scheme 16). Scheme 16. Biosynthesis of fumipyrrole in A. fumigatus.103. Open in a new tab4.6. Biosynthesis of neosartoricin and fumicyclines The meroterpenoid neosartoricin was first isolated following activation of the six-gene nsc/fcc cluster in both A. fumigatus and Neosartorya fischeri, which harbors genes encoding the TE-less NR-PKS NscA/FccA, the metallo-β-lactamase-type thioesterase NscB/FccB, the Flavin-dependent monooxygenase NscC/FccC, the polycyclic prenyltransferase NscD/FccD, the NAD-dependent dehydratase NscE/FccE, and the pathway-specific Zn(ii)2Cys6 transcription factor NscR/FccR.105 In both species, the cluster was activated through overexpression of NscR/FccR. Shortly after, related fumicyclines A and B were isolated from A. fumigatus following cocultivation with Streptomyces rapamycinicus.106 Full genome microarrays were used to identify the gene cluster responsible for production of fumicyclines, which revealed up-regulation of the nsc/fcc gene cluster following cocultivation. To confirm the involvement of this cluster, NR-PKS-encoding nscA/fccA was deleted, which resulted in complete elimination of fumicycline production. For both studies, the biosynthetic pathway of neosartoricin and fumicyclines was proposed based on the detection of intermediates and shunt products (Scheme 17). Biosynthesis initiates with reactions catalyzed by the NR-PKS NscA/FccA and release of the nascent polyketide product by NscB/FccB. The intermediate then undergoes a loss of CO2, followed by prenylation catalyzed by NscD/FccD and hydroxylation by NscC/FccC to yield fumicycline B. Fumicycline B then undergoes O-acetylation to yield neosartoricin or dehydration to yield fumicycline A. Scheme 17. Biosynthesis of neosartoricin and fumicyclines in A. fumigatus.105,106 . Open in a new tab4.7. Biosynthesis of fumagillin Since its discovery in 1951, the antibiotic fumagillin has been extensively studied for its medicinal applications, which include anti-angiogenic activity through inhibition of human type 2 methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP-2) and potential use for treatment of amebiasis and microsporidiosis.107–110 Fumagillin is a meroterpenoid that possesses a highly-oxygenated cyclohexane ring esterified with a decatetraenedioic acid. Interestingly, although the total synthesis of fumagillin has been well-studied,111,112 its biosynthetic pathway had not been elucidated. Researchers therefore examined SM clusters harboring genes encoding HR-PKSs in A. fumigatus, and identified a candidate cluster containing genes encoding MetAP-2 and a type 1 MetAP, which they hypothesized might be involved in self-resistance against fumgaillin.113 To confirm that this cluster was responsible for fumagillin production, the cluster's HR-PKS, designated fma-PKS, was deleted, which resulted in complete elimination of fumagillin production. In vitro assays were used to decipher the functions of other enzymes encoded within the fma cluster, which enabled the biosynthetic pathway of fumagillin to be proposed (Scheme 18). Biosynthesis of the terpenoid portion of the carbon backbone involves initial generation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which is converted to sesquiterpene β-trans-bergamotene by the terpene cyclase fma-TC, which then undergoes two rounds of epoxidation, dihydroxylation, and O-methylation to yield fumagillol. In parallel, the HR-PKS fma-PKS biosynthesizes the polyketide product, which is then combined with fumagillol in a reaction catalyzed by fma-AT. The intermediate's terminal alkene is then epoxidated, followed by hydrolysis to yield a vicinal diol, followed by cleavage to yield an aldehyde, and oxidation to generate fumagillin. Scheme 18.

Biosynthesis of kotanin To identify the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of the bicoumarin kotanin in A. niger, scientists searched for gene clusters containing NR-PKS genes, since formation of the monomeric coumarin does not require any reduction steps.114 The candidate clusters were further narrowed down to include only clusters harboring cytochrome P450 or monooxygenases, which would be required for kotanin production. The NR-PKS required for kotanin biosynthesis was confirmed to be KtnS through targeted gene deletion, which led to complete loss of coumarin production. The functions of the other genes within the cluster were investigated using targeted gene deletions, which confirmed the involvement of the O-methyltransferase KtnB and the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase KtnC in kotanin biosynthesis, and allowed the biosynthetic pathway for kotanin to be proposed (Scheme 19). The pathway is initially catalyzed by KtnS to synthesize the pentaketidic dihydroxycoumarin, followed by O-methylation by KtnB to yield a siderin derivative. Next, KtnC catalyzes an oxidative phenol coupling reaction while controlling regio- and stereoselectivity to generate P-(+)-orlandin. Docking experiments were performed to explore the mechanism of regio- and stereoselectivity, which revealed that it is likely dependent on substrate orientation in the active site of KtnC.114P-(+)-kotanin is then generated following O-methylation of P-(+)-orlandin. Scheme 19. Biosynthesis of kotanin in A. niger.114. Open in a new tab5.2. Biosynthesis of azanigerones Although many SM gene clusters contain only one encoding PKS, others contain two that can either work in sequence or in convergence to biosynthesize the polyketide product.44,115,116 When two PKS enzymes work in sequence, the polyketide chain biosynthesized from the first PKS is transferred to the second PKS, which continues the chain elongation process. Two PKSs working in convergence function independently of one another, and the polyketide products generated from each enzyme are ultimately connected by other pathway enzymes. To explore similar PKS–PKS partnerships in A. niger, researchers overexpressed a pathway-specific transcription factor that was present in a cluster that also harbored the NR-PKS AzaA and the HR-PKS AzaB, which led to the production of previously unknown azaphilone SMs.117 Azaphilones are a class of compounds that consist of a highly-oxygenated bicyclic core and a chiral quaternary center.118 They are structurally diverse and feature a wide range of bioactivities, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and nematicidal properties.118 The most abundant azaphilone produced in the overexpression strain was designated as azanigerone A. Other related compounds were produced at earlier time points, including FK17-P2a and azanigerones B and C, and azanigerone D was observed to replace azanigerone A at later time points. To further explore the mechanism of collaboration between NR-PKS AzaA and HR-PKS AzaB in azanigerone biosynthesis, an azaB-deletion strain was generated, which upon culturing led to the accumulation of two new compounds, designated as azanigerones E and F. This suggests a convergence biosynthesis model, in which AzaA and AzaB biosynthesize two discrete polyketide products which are combined at later step in the pathway. Interestingly, this is the first report of convergent collaboration between an NR-PKS and a HR-PKS in SM biosynthesis. These findings, combined with subsequent in vitro experiments to confirm the role of tailoring enzyme AzaH, enabled scientists to propose a pathway for azaphilone biosynthesis in A. niger (Scheme 20). The NR-PKS AzaA catalyzes biosynthesis of a hexaketide precursor, which then undergoes a terminal ketone reduction catalyzed by the ketoreductase AzaE to yield FK17-P2a. Next, the monooxygenase AzaH hydroxylates FK17-P2a, which facilitates formation of the pyran-ring and generation of azanigerone E. In parallel, the HR-PKS AzaB biosynthesizes a 2,4-dimethylhexanoyl chain, which is combined with FK17-P2a to generate azanigerone B in a reaction facilitated by the acyltransferase AzaD. Next, azanigerone B is hydroxylated by FAD-dependent monooxygenase AzaG or AzaL to yield azanigerone C, followed by C–C oxidative cleavage by cytochrome P450 AzaI, and oxidation of the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid by AzaJ, yielding azanigerone A. Azanigerone A can then undergo addition of NH3 to generate azanigerone D, which was observed to replace azanigerone A production at later time points. Scheme 20. Biosynthesis of azanigerones in A. niger.117. Open in a new tab5.3. Biosynthesis of yanuthone D The yanuthones comprise a group of SMs that feature an epoxylated six-member ring with a sesquiterpene and two other varying side chains.119 The core structure of yanuthones can be derived from the polyketide 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA), which are distinguished as class I yanuthones, or from an unknown precursor that generates a C6-core scaffold, which are distinguished as class II yanuthones.120 The class I yanuthone, yanuthone D, has displayed potent antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.119,121 To investigate the capacity of A. niger to produce 6-MSA-derived SMs, the A. niger PKS-encoding YanA was heterologously expressed in A. nidulans to confirm its involvement in the biosynthesis of the polyketide 6-MSA.121 To identify the final SM product of the 10-gene yan cluster, a yanA-deletion strain was generated and screened on various media, which revealed a loss of production of two SMs that were identified as yanuthones D and E. The biosynthetic pathway of yanuthone D was further investigated by individually deleting genes within the yan cluster which resulted in the accumulation of yanuthone intermediates, and enabled a biosynthetic pathway to be proposed (Scheme 21). The pathway initiates with the biosynthesis of 6-MSA by the PKS YanA, followed by decarboxylation by YanB, and hydroxylation by the cytochrome P450 YanC, yielding toluquinol. Epoxide formation is then catalyzed by YanD and/or YanE, followed by prenylation by YanG to form 7-deacetoxyyanuthone A. Next, cytochrome P450 YanH catalyzes conversion to 22-deacetylyanuthone A, followed by conversion to yanuthone E by the O-mevalon transferase YanI. Interestingly, this is the first time that O-mevalon transferase activity has been molecularly characterized. Lastly, the oxidase YanF catalyzes the formation of yanuthone D from yanuthone E. Scheme 21. Biosynthesis of yanuthone D in A. niger.121. Open in a new tab5.4. Biosynthesis of the pyranonigrins The pyranonigrins are a group of compounds produced by A. niger with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging antioxidant activity.20,122 The pyn gene cluster was activated by introducing a plasmid containing the pathway-specific Zn2Cys6 transcriptional regulator pynR under control of the arginase (aga) promoter.123 Cluster activation resulted in induced transcription of PKS–NRPS-encoding pynA, FAD-dependent oxidoreductase-encoding pynB, N-methyltransferase-encoding pynC, cytochrome P450 oxidase-encoding pynD, and NAD-binding protein-encoding pynE, along with production of the SM pyranonigrin E. In a subsequent study, the pyn cluster was activated by replacing the pynR promoter with the robust glaA promoter,124 and the biosynthetic pathway of pyranonigrin E was investigated using cluster gene deletion mutants in combination with in vivo and in vitro assays.125 Researchers identified three additional pyn cluster genes, including flavin-dependent oxidase-encoding pynG, aspartase protease-encoding pynH, and thioesterase-encoding pynI. The proposed biosynthetic pathway initiates with biosynthesis of the polyketide–nonribosomal peptide hybrid product by PynA, followed by release of the intermediate from PynA by PynI, generating pyranonigrin J (Scheme 22). Next PynC catalyzes N-methylation of pyranonigin J, followed by epoxidation by PynG, which facilitates the subsequent ring closure. PynD and PynH then catalyze the formation of pyranonigrin E, which can then dimerize to form pyranonigrin F. Alternatively, PynE can catalyze the conversion of pyranonigrin E to pyranonigrin G, which can be reversed by the PynB. Scheme 22. Biosynthesis of pyranonigrins E–J in A. niger.123,125 . Open in a new tabThe potent antioxidant pyranonigrin A, whose production was previously reported in A. niger,126,127 was found to be biosynthesized by a PKS–NRPS gene cluster different from the pyn cluster.128 The biosynthetic pathway of pyranonigrin A, which was elucidated in Penicillium thymicola, involves initial biosynthesis of the polyketide–nonribosomal peptide product by the PKS–NRPS PyrA, followed by product release catalyzed by either a Dieckmann cyclase (DKC) and/or the hydrolase PyrD (Scheme 23). Next, FAD-binding monooxygenase PyrC may catalyze epoxidation followed by subsequent ring closure to form the pyrano[2,3-c]pyrrole core, followed by conversion to pyranonigrin S and pyranonigrin A by cytochrome P450 PyrB.

Genetic characterization of secondary metabolites in Aspergillus terreus In 2014, a review summarizing advances in SM genome mining in A. terreus was published by C. J. Guo et al.,129 which included the genetic characterization of terretonin,130 asperfuranone,12 terrein,131 terreic acid,132 and acetylaranotin.133 This section focuses on discoveries made in A. terreus SM biosynthesis research since that review was published. 6.1. Biosynthesis of aspterric acid The gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the potent herbicide aspterric acid was identified using a resistance-gene-directed approach.134 Scientists focused on identifying SMs that would target the dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) enzyme within the branched chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthetic pathway, which is necessary for plant growth and considered a specific target for weed-control agents.135 They reasoned that gene clusters responsible for biosynthesis of a DHAD inhibitor may also include a self-resistance gene, such as an additional copy of DHAD that is not sensitive to the produced inhibitor. Such a cluster was identified in A. terreus, which included genes encoding the sesquiterpene cyclase AstA, cytochrome P450 enzymes AstB and AstC, and a homolog of DHAD AstD. Interestingly, this cluster is conserved across multiple fungal genomes, including Neosartorya fischeri NRRL 181, Penicillium brasilianum, and Penicillium solitum strain RS1.134 To activate the silent gene cluster, astA, astB, and astC were heterologously expressed stepwise in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RC01, which resulted in the production of the sesquiterpenoid aspterric acid and its biosynthetic intermediates, and enabled researchers to propose the biosynthetic pathway for aspterric acid (Scheme 24). Its biosynthesis initiates with the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate by AstA to yield (–)-daucane, followed by AstB-catalyzed oxidation to convert a methyl group to a carboxylic acid and form an epoxide. Next, the oxidation of a methyl group by AstC yields an alcohol, which facilitates an intramolecular epoxide opening to generate aspterric acid. Aspterric acid was found to inhibit DHAD at sub-micromolar levels, highlighting its capacity for use as a potent herbicidal agent. Additionally, the ability of the DHAD AstD to confer self-resistance to aspterric acid was confirmed. Scheme 24. Biosynthesis of aspterric acid in A. terreus.134. Open in a new tab6.2. Biosynthesis of phenguignardic acid The NRPS-like-encoding gene pgnA was activated in A. terreus using a doxycycline-dependent inducible Tet-on expression system that had previously been developed for the activation of genes in A. niger.104,136 The system involves gdpA-mediated constitutive expression of the doxycycline-dependent transcriptional activator rtTA fused to tetO7 sites and a Pmin promoter sequence that precedes the target gene. In the presence of doxycycline, rtRA binds to tetO7-Pmin and activates transcription of the target gene. The study revealed that activation of the pgnA resulted in the production of phenguignardic acid,136 which has displayed non-host-specific phytotoxic activity.137 Heterologous expression in A. nidulans confirmed that PgnA is independently responsible for phenguignardic acid production (Scheme 25).

Biosynthesis of asperphenamate The amino acid ester asperphenamate and its derivatives have displayed potent activity against breast cancer cell lines.138,139 The structure of asperphenamate consists of N-benzoylphenylalanine and N-benzoylphenylalaninol subunits, which are linked together by an ester. Its bioactivity and rare structure prompted the molecular characterization of asperphenamate. Targeted gene deletions in asperphenamate-producing Penicillium brevicompactum confirmed that the apm cluster, which harbors two NRPSs and is conserved across the genomes of A. terreus and Aspergillus aculeatus, is responsible for asperphenamate biosynthesis.140 The biosynthetic pathway of asperphenamate was elucidated by examining the production of biosynthetic intermediates in deletion strains and by conducting feeding studies in heterologous hosts. This study confirmed that NRPSs ApmA and ApmB are sufficient for biosynthesis of asperphenamate, despite the presence of potential tailoring enzymes within the cluster (Scheme 26). First, ApmA biosynthesizes an amide intermediate from phenylalanine and benzoic acid precursors. ApmB activates the same substrates and accepts the ApmA-biosynthesized linear dipeptidyl precursor, which are combined through inter-molecular ester bond formation to generate asperphenamate. Interestingly, this was the first study to reveal a two-module NRPS system responsible for the biosynthesis of an amino acid ester. Scheme 26. Biosynthesis of asperphenamate in A. terreus.140.

Biosynthesis of citreoviridin Citreoviridin is an ATP synthase inhibitor that has been investigated as a therapeutic agent to target breast cancer.141 To identify its biosynthetic gene cluster in A. terreus, a resistance-gene-driven approach was utilized.142 One such cluster contained the F1-ATPase β-chain-encoding CtvE, which is a subunit of the target of citreoviridin, along with genes encoding the HR-PKS CtvA, the SAM-dependent methyltransferase CtvB, the flavin-dependent monooxygenase CtvC, and the hydrolase CtvD. To investigate the biosynthetic pathway of citreoviridin, the genes within the ctv cluster were heterologously expressed stepwise in A. nidulans, which resulted in the production of intermediates and allowed a biosynthetic pathway to be proposed (Scheme 27). CtvA first biosynthesizes an α-pyrone intermediate, which undergoes hydroxyl group methylation by CtvB to yield citreomontanin. Next, the citreomontanin terminal alkenes undergo isomerization to form a (17Z)-hexaene, which is bisepoxidated by CtvC. CtvD then catalyzes formation of the tetrahydrofuran ring, resulting in citreoviridin production. Scheme 27. Biosynthesis of citreoviridin in A. terreus.142. Open in a new tab7. Conclusion In the post-genomic era, fungal sequencing initiatives have accelerated our ability to link SMs to their biosynthetic gene clusters. Further, they have enhanced our understanding of fungal SM biosynthetic processes and the underpinning genes that define them. Such knowledge can have enormous applications for pharmaceutical production and industrial processes, as genetic engineering can be used to optimize SM production levels or to generate useful second-generation analogs. Despite the significant progress made in the past six years, many SMs that Aspergillus species have the capacity to produce still have not been identified or linked to their biosynthetic gene clusters, which remains true for many other fungal species. Thorough characterization of the Aspergillus secondary metabolome will require a combination of approaches, including the use of inducible promoters, overexpression of pathway-specific regulators, growth in various conditions, heterologous expression, and gene knockout techniques, along with the collaborative effort of the research community.Conflicts of interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest.Acknowledgments Research in the Wang group is supported in part by R21 AI127640 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, by NNX15AB49G from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and by WP-2339 from the U.S. Department of Defense, Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program.
