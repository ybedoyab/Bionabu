    "introduction": "Introduction As the goal for human space exploration moves farther from Earth, relying on a constant resupply of resources from Earth becomes less viable. In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) approaches have the aim of enabling sustainable exploration and settlement of space, by mitigating the need of importing goods and materials from Earth (NASA-ASEE 1992; Anand et al. 2012; Montague et al. 2012; Menezes et al. 2015b; Verseux et al. 2016). Microbial-based biotechnologies and biomanufacturing approaches have demonstrated their high efficacy in several applications and may become a key component of future ISRU strategies (Brown et al. 2008; Slenzka and Kempf 2010; Montague et al. 2012; Verseux et al. 2016; Nangle et al. 2020; Volponi and Lasseur 2020; Berliner et al. 2021; Castelein et al. 2021; Keller et al. 2021). Minerals and metals will be necessary resources for construction, infrastructure and manufacturing. Water, oxygen, volatiles, essential nutrients for human nutrition and soil fertilization, are all elements which will be essential to establish self-sufficient settlements, and that could be obtained from extraterrestrial rocks (Cockell 2011). Mining of these resources will therefore be a priority for an extraterrestrial settlement. Microorganisms can be applied to these needs, extracting useful elements by a technique called biomining or bioleaching. Currently on Earth around 20–25% of copper and 5% of gold are extracted using biomining (Johnson et al. 2013). Bioleaching can provide economic and environmental advantages compared to other methods (Srichandan et al. 2019) and can be used as a complementary technique to extract trace metals from mine waste, or recover low-grade ores which cannot be treated by conventional methods (Bosecker 1997). Mining processes produce an enormous amount of waste low-grade rock material and mill tailings, which often still contain useful trace elements that cannot be further recovered by traditional methods. However, these can be accessible to small microbial cells, as an effect of specific types of metabolism (Blowes et al. 2003; Schippers et al. 2013; Johnson 2014; Jerez 2017a). With the same principle, bioleaching techniques can be applied to the recycling of useful metals from secondary solid waste (Schippers et al. 2013; Johnson 2014; Jerez 2017b). A good example is provided by the recovery of rare earth elements (REEs, Reed et al. 2016) or copper from electronic waste (Srichandan et al. 2019). Many advantages of biomining over traditional techniques on Earth also apply to space. For instance, biomining generally requires lower energy compared to traditional mining (Schippers et al. 2013), which will be an advantage in space, where resources are limited and many engineering constraints may be in place. Nevertheless, space conditions and available rock materials are different from those present on Earth and which are commonly used in terrestrial biomining. On one hand, traditional autotrophic and chemolithotrophic microbes used for terrestrial biomining do not need to rely on organic compounds as nutrients, which are very scarce in extraterrestrial environments, to grow (Johansson 1992; Fahrion et al. 2021). On the other hand, rocks present on celestial bodies of mining interest have very diverse compositions. In some cases (e.g., the Moon and some asteroids) sulphide-containing minerals are scarce compared to ore-grade sulphide minerals which are the focus of terrestrial biomining (Lewis 1992; Anand et al. 2012; Righter et al. 2017; Steenstra et al. 2018, 2020; Brounce et al. 2019, 2020). This poses restrictions on the possibility of directly transferring our current knowledge on bioleaching, which is mainly based on chemolithoautotrophic iron- and/or sulphur-oxidising microorganisms, to space. This review explores the topic of space biomining, discussing the main principles and feasibility, and analyses possible applications. We discuss limitations and highlight that, considering the materials available in space, it is necessary to expand our knowledge on organotrophic, cyanobacteria and community-based bioleaching mechanisms. Finally, we propose to consider the addition of biomining compartments to supply basic chemical requirements for Biological Life-Support Systems (BLSS), and vice versa.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions As the goal for space exploration expands toward establishing permanent settlements in space, space biomining is generating an increasing interest. The main space agencies have recognized its potential in their roadmaps. Many are the advantages, as terrestrial biomining is considered a sustainable approach in both the economic and environmental terms (Jerez 2017a). Moreover, many rocks in the Solar System would be considered low-grade ores for terrestrial standards (Cockell and Santomartino, in press), and biomining on Earth is commonly used to process mine waste, dumps and tailings (Bosecker 1997; Mishra and Rhee 2014). The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to bioremediation, recycling of waste and to support BLSS. Although promising, the science around space biomining is still relatively young. Considering the differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions, including rock type and ore availability, a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be always possible. Energetic and metabolic demands need to be taken into account. Engineering requirements for space biomining reactors will require temperature controls, aeration and stirring under complex and harsh conditions. While most terrestrial biomining knowledge is based on autotrophic microorganisms able to break down sulphidic minerals without the need of carbon compounds, many rocks in the Solar Systems may present a low sulphur content. In these cases, heterotrophic microorganisms could be a better choice, but they would require organic compounds. Moreover, most bioleaching reactions are aerobic, and oxygen itself will be a commodity in space. A careful selection of the most appropriate techniques and microorganisms will be required for any given application, and the optimal solution could include complementary systems (Averesch 2021). Ethic and planetary protection discussions are outside of the aim of this review. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take them into account when planning the preferred method for mining or ISRU in a specific region or planetary body, as they could pose a further limitation. Biomining is one of the possible approaches to achieve ISRU, and its selection over other methods should at least consider all the parameters discussed here. Nevertheless, its advantages make it pivotal to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications. This includes learning more on the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expanding our knowledge on organotrophic, cyanobacteria and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, on anaerobic biomining, and investigating the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations.",

This review explores the topic of space biomining, discussing the main principles and feasibility, and analyses possible applications. We discuss limitations and highlight that, considering the materials available in space, it is necessary to expand our knowledge on organotrophic, cyanobacteria and community-based bioleaching mechanisms. Finally, we propose to consider the addition of biomining compartments to supply basic chemical requirements for Biological Life-Support Systems (BLSS), and vice versa.Space biomining principles When talking about space biomining for ISRU, the following three main questions have to be addressed: (1) What elements do we need to obtain for a given application? (2) Where can we find them? (3) Which mining strategy would work best (this could exclude biomining in some cases)? We will try to address these questions, to the best of our knowledge, in this section. Answering these questions can be complex, as it involves an interdisciplinary knowledge of the space conditions present on the planetary body we want to mine, the type of rocks and mineral compositions available (including their intrinsic leachability and toxicity), the engineering technologies and biotechnologies required, in-space operational approach (a thorough discussion on the requirements for life support systems and ISRU for space exploration, although focused on cyanobacteria-based structures, has been reported in Keller et al. 2021), and the appropriate microorganism(s) and its metabolism(s) (Averesch 2021). The situation becomes even more complicated when discussing asteroid biomining, given that the mined resources would likely not be used in situ, therefore requiring additional transport to the location of utilization (see Sect. 4.3). To answer the first question, elements of high interest from the space biomining perspective vary depending on the aim (Cockell 2011; Raafat et al. 2013). Generally speaking, elements and molecules of interest for the establishment of a human settlements are water, molecular oxygen, essential mineral nutrients (e.g., potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, sulphur), gaseous volatiles (e.g., hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, helium), structural metals such as iron, copper, nickel and vanadium, and elements useful for electronic devices such as silicon and REEs (Menezes et al. 2015a, b). Some of these, especially volatiles, could be used to produce fuel or water (such as hydrogen, Klas et al. 2015). Of great economic interest are also elements as platinum group elements (PGE), gold, and silver, which are currently expensive. This list is not intended to be complete. It must be noted that many rocks in the Solar System would be regarded as low-grade ores, in respect to those considered suitable for mining on Earth (Cockell and Santomartino, in press). However, biomining on Earth is often used to process mine waste, dumps and tailings which cannot be easily treated by conventional methods (Bosecker 1997; Mishra and Rhee 2014; Klas et al. 2015). Growth, and in some cases bioleaching, of diverse microorganisms on extraterrestrial rocks or simulants have been demonstrated (Gronstal et al. 2009; Olsson-Francis and Cockell 2010; Kölbl et al. 2017; Metzger et al. 2020; Volger et al. 2020; Milojevic et al. 2021), suggesting that, with the appropriate selection of species or consortia and conditions, microbial interaction with extraterrestrial substrate is possible. Moreover, space biomining experiments have been already performed in space. These include BioRock (Cockell et al. 2020, 2021; Santomartino et al. 2020) and BioAsteroid (2020/2021, data analysis in preparation), both performed onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and a preparative mission for BioRock (Byloos et al. 2017). Although not intended as fully scaled-up biomining experiments, they first demonstrated the feasibility of biomining in space using heterotrophic microorganisms (bacteria and fungi), and basalt or meteorite as substrates. Space conditions and effects on biomining Environments outside Earth show a variety of conditions which differ from those present on Earth’s surface. Their effects on microbial behaviour at different levels (e.g., growth, survival, resistance, virulence, biofilm formation) have been widely reported (reviewed in Horneck et al. 2010; Senatore et al. 2018), and still there is much yet to be understood (Cockell 2021). Space can be considered an umbrella term which includes a variety of environments, each one with its own characteristics. For the aim of this review, we will report the following conditions present in three different space environments of relevance for the space biomining perspective: Mars, the Moon and asteroids (Table 1). On asteroids, given their small mass, we can generally assume conditions equivalent to that of spaceflight beyond Earth’s Van Allen belts, as described below. Table 1. Conditions on Moon, Mars and asteroids that could influence space biomining, compared to those on Earth Condition Planetary body Mars Moon Asteroids Earth Gravity 0.38×g 0.16×g Micro to centigravity 1×g Ionizing radiations ~ 20 µGy/hour (GCR, SEP) ~ 13.2 µGy/hour (GCR, SEP) (GCR, SEP) 0.034–0.114 µGy/hour (Baumstark-Khan and Facius 2002) Atmosphere composition 95% CO2, 2.8% N2, 2.1% Ar, trace gases Negligible Absent 78% N2, 20.9% O2, 0.9% Ar, 0.04% CO2, trace gases Pressure 6.1 mbar 3 × 10–15 bar Vacuum 1 bar (at sea level) Temperature − 153 °C to + 20 °C − 178 °C to + 124 °C Depends on the asteroid.

GCR galactic cosmic rays, SEP Solar energetic particlesAll the conditions described here assume that the biomining operation has access to liquid water, an essential requirement for life (Cockell 2021). Water must either be obtained on the body of interest or imported. Although this is critical for biomining operations, here we focus on the other environmental conditions within a biomining reactor that influence growth within a liquid environment. i.Gravity Gravity is proportional to the mass of the celestial body under examination. As a consequence, gravities at the surface of Mars, the Moon and asteroids are lower than on Earth (9.8 m/s2, or 1×g). Mars has a gravity regimen of 3.7 m/s2 (~ 0.38×g), the Moon 1.62 m/s2 (~ 0.16×g). Microgravity (µg or ~ 10–6×g) is the gravity condition generally experienced in a spacecraft in a free trajectory (either in transit from one celestial body to another, or in orbit around one; Horneck et al. 2010; Zea et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2018). Gravitational levels at the surface of an asteroid depend on the mass and the irregularity of its shape. While for more massive objects such as Ceres (0.27 m/s2, or ~ 0.03×g), now considered a dwarf planet, gravity may be slightly higher (centigravity, in fact), the majority of asteroids are expected to have a gravity regimen similar to microgravity (Klas et al. 2015). It has been reported that cells with a diameter of less than 10 µm, which is the case for bacteria, archaea and many fungi, are too small to be directly affected by gravity or the lack thereof (Pollard 1965; Horneck et al. 2010; Zea et al. 2017). Instead, the responses observed are likely to be the indirect effects of altered extracellular environment where mass transport to and from the cell is limited to Brownian motion, limiting nutrient availability and resulting in the build-up of metabolic by-products with respect to 1×g (Bosecker 1997; Zea 2015; Zea et al. 2016). However, microbial structures, namely biofilms, can be orders of magnitude larger. While biofilm growth is well known to occur on spacecraft components during spaceflight (McLean et al. 2001; Zea et al. 2020), controlled experiments have not shown consistent results, as increase, decrease, and no changes on biofilms grown in microgravity with respect to controls on Earth have been reported (reviewed in Zea et al. 2018). However, the effects of gravity on microbe-mineral interaction have not been characterized yet and should be further investigated. BioRock, a recent space biomining experiment mentioned above, showed no difference in final cell concentrations for three biomining bacterial species after 3 weeks of growth under terrestrial, Martian and micro-gravity (Santomartino et al. 2020). This result suggests that space microbial biotechnologies, including biomining, could be indifferent to gravitational conditions. Nevertheless, various hardware settings and reactor volumes may lead to divergent results, and other microbial species could react differently. Furthermore, processes that require gravity (e.g. sedimentation) will be impacted by changes in gravitational conditions. ii.Radiation Earth’s magnetosphere and atmosphere protect us on the surface from most of the radiation environment experienced in space. Beyond the Van Allen belts (Prölss 2004), usually referred to as ‘deep space’, a radiation environment, mostly consisting of (i) galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and (ii) Solar energetic particles (SEP), exists (Zeitlin et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2020). In the case of the lunar surface, neutrons as secondary particles arising from the interaction of GCRs and SEP’s and the regolith may have an impact on biological systems that is yet unknown (Horneck et al. 2010; Klas et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2020). Hence, biomining operations beyond the Van Allen belts (i.e., on the Moon, Mars, and asteroids) need to consider the higher radiation environment. A wide literature studied microbial response and resistance to high dose of space radiations, including long-term exposure experiments outside the ISS (Horneck et al. 2012). Many of these studies focused on resistance and survival after exposure in a dried or dormant state. Among the microorganisms that showed a higher resistance to space radiations we can find Chrooccocidiopsis (Cockell et al. 2005; Billi et al. 2019), Bacillus subtilis (Moeller et al. 2014; Ulrich et al. 2018; Nicholson and Ricco 2020) and Deinococcus radiodurans (Mattimore and Battista 1996; Minton 1996), and some fungi as Aspergillus niger (Cortesão et al. 2020). Many of these have been also tested for their biomining (Brandl et al. 1999; Rozas et al. 2017; Faraji et al. 2018; Giese et al. 2019) or biosorption (Liu et al. 2012; Jaafar et al. 2015) capacity, suggesting a possible role for biomining in space. It must be noted that some of the molecular mechanisms of radiation (and related stresses) tolerance require the entrance of the cell in a dormant state (e.g., endospore formation, desiccation). These may not be useful in a context of space biomining, in which metabolically active cells are required. Further research is, therefore, necessary to link these two fields of study, in order to understand the most suitable microorganisms or mechanisms for long-term biomining operations. iii.Atmosphere composition and pressure Mars has a thin atmosphere, composed of approximately 95% of CO2, 2.8% of N2, 2,1% Ar, trace gases including oxygen (0.13%) and hydrogen (Franz et al. 2017), and dust, with an average pressure at the surface of 6.1 mbar (Haberle 2015). Lunar atmosphere (composed of argon, helium, neon, sodium, potassium, hydrogen, trace elements and dust), with a pressure at the surface of 3 × 10–15 bar and an average abundance at the surface of 2 × 105 particles/cm3, is considered negligible (Stern 1999; Lawson et al. 2005). Asteroids, including Ceres, possess no atmosphere (Hughes 1994, Table 1). From a biomining perspective, the absence of oxygen constitutes a clear problem for those applications requiring aerobic microorganisms. The majority of bioleaching mechanisms elucidated so far occur in aerobic conditions. Nevertheless, anaerobic bioleaching has been demonstrated for some bacteria, although the mechanisms are not fully understood yet (Singh and Cameotra 2015). In anaerobic reductive dissolution, Fe3+ is used as electron acceptor. A. ferrooxidans, for instance, can catalyse the reduction of Fe3+ under anaerobic and acidic conditions, coupled with oxidation of a c-type cytochrome (Ohmura et al. 2002; Hallberg et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2013; Singh and Cameotra 2015; Marrero et al. 2020). Shewanella onediensis, a facultative anaerobe, could extract iron from lunar and Martian simulants under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Castelein et al. 2021). Microorganisms with alternative types of metabolism, or bioengineering approaches, may also be used. More problematic may be the low pressure or, in the case of the Moon and asteroids, vacuum. Pressure is one of the parameters that can profoundly influence microbial proliferation, mostly due to desiccation and reduced gas concentration, and Martian atmospheric pressure is already too low to support most microbial growth (Schwendner and Schuerger 2020; Verseux 2020). The current lowest pressure recorded for microbial growth is 0.7 kPa (7 mbar; Schuerger and Nicholson 2016). Nevertheless, low-pressure vacuum is used in biotechnologies, including biomining (Gnida 2020), and a bioreactor using low-pressure Mars-similar gas composition was successfully developed for cyanobacterial growth (Verseux et al. 2021). This suggests that, with the appropriate adaptation and engineering, challenges posed by extraterrestrial atmospheric composition and pressure could be overcome not to limit biomining applications. Low pressure could, indeed, reduce the engineering requirements of bioreactors. iv.Temperature Temperature can influence not only microbial growth, but also the availability of liquid water for medium growth. Considering the prohibitive space temperatures and variations, discussed below, any space biotechnological application will need to use temperature-controlled bioreactors. However, temperatures of biological-based processes are generally lower than those using chemical or physical processes (Johnson 2014), and bioengineering and synthetic biology approaches could improve biomining capacity at low temperatures in order to decrease energy requirements. Martian surface temperature undergo considerable variations, leading to values varying from − 153 to + 20 °C (Murphy et al. 1990; Haberle 2015). Due to the negligible atmosphere, surface temperature on the Moon varies between − 178 °C and + 124 °C (Williams et al. 2017). Asteroid surface temperatures depend on the distance from the Sun as well as from local differences in composition and topographic features, and they can vary largely among asteroids. On Ceres, surface temperatures oscillates between − 143 and − 73 °C, and similar conditions can be expected on smaller asteroids. For example, the highest surface temperature on asteroid 21 Lutetia, measured by Visible, InfraRed, and Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) on Rosetta, was − 28 °C (Coradini et al. 2011), and the surface temperature of Ryugu, measured by the Japanese Hayabusa2 orbiter, varies between − 50 °C and + 60 °C (Okada et al. 2020). In other words, on all extraterrestrial bodies known, temperatures tend to generally exceed the known limits to life, implying that biomining operations will need to be conducted under strict temperature control. v.Rock composition, regolith and minerals Regolith and rock composition need to be taken into account when deciding which biomining microorganism or technique to use in a given region of a planetary body, to extract the desired element(s), especially considering that they could also contain toxic compounds, for instance perchlorates (Hecht et al. 2009; Linnarsson et al. 2012; Kounaves et al. 2014; Wadsworth and Cockell 2017). Fine regolith is particularly interesting from the mining perspective, as extracting elements from it would spare the energy required for rock crushing (Carter 1992). The composition of Mars and Moon crusts have been highly studied and characterized. This allowed the preparation of several Martian and lunar analogue materials, which can be used to test if they could provide good substrates for microbial growth and elemental extraction (Olsson-Francis and Cockell 2010). A variety of meteorites are available to study asteroid composition, and microbial growth on meteorites has been demonstrated (Tait et al. 2017; Milojevic et al. 2019). Our knowledge on Martian rock composition comes from landers, orbiting spacecrafts and Martian meteorite data. Martian bulk crust is mostly igneous and basaltic (McSween et al. 2009; Ehlmann and Edwards 2014; Yoshizaki and McDonough 2020), with a high level of oxidized iron and magnesium (Clark 1993; Rieder et al. 1997; Yen et al. 2005; McSween et al. 2009). Major minerals present in the Martian crust are silicates such as plagioclase, pyroxene and olivine (Ehlmann and Edwards 2014). FeO is also particularly abundant (Taylor 2013). Previous studies reported a high sulphur composition in Martian surface, mostly in the form of sulphate minerals (Greenwood et al. 2000; Franz et al. 2019). Clay, carbonate and sulphate deposits have been found, and calcium, iron and magnesium sulphate minerals have been identified from landers and orbital data (Ehlmann and Edwards 2014). However, recent estimations on sulphur abundance in Martian interiors suggest that sulphur and volatile content could be much less than previously indicated (Wang and Becker 2017; Franz et al. 2019; Yoshizaki and McDonough 2020), and sulphur has been found in small scale in certain zones of Martian surface (Ehlmann and dwards 2014). Zinc content is quite high while copper may be less present than on Earth, although copper-rich deposits could exist in specific Martian regions (Payré et al. 2019). Lunar composition is largely silica-saturated basalts, anorthosite and breccia (Jolliff 2008); however, specific compositions differ around the crust, and between highlands and maria (Jolliff et al. 2000; Arai et al. 2008). Therefore, the relative abundance of minerals in lunar rocks or regolith depends on the location (Sivakumar et al. 2017). They include plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, ilmenite, spinel and less abundant minerals (Meyer 2003; Ohtake et al. 2009; Anand et al. 2012; Sivakumar et al. 2017), and they are anhydrous and reduced (Jolliff 2008). Interestingly, new mineral species have been identified on the Moon, for instance tranquillityite (Jolliff 2008). Sulphide-bearing apatite was also discovered in lunar rocks, although apatite is present only as accessory phases (Brounce et al. 2019, 2020), as well as sulphides (Anand et al. 2012). Therefore, sulphur appears to be less abundant on the Moon compared to Mars and some asteroids (Righter et al. 2017; Steenstra et al. 2018). Lunar regolith follows a similar composition dominated by aluminosilicate basic rocks (anorthosites, nortic anorthosites, gabbroic anorthosite; Ohtake et al. 2009), with particle size between 10 nm and 100 µm. Mining fine lunar regolith has been proposed as particularly interesting from the mining perspective, because it would not require rock crushing (Carter 1992). Moreover, lunar regolith presents solar wind implanted volatiles of great interest for ISRU, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon and helium (Anand et al. 2012). The presence of helium has attracted interest, as initial calculations estimated a possible cost-efficient transport to Earth as a source of clean energy (Wittenberg et al. 1986). However, more recent evaluations are less positive (Carter 1992; Anand et al. 2012). Particularly promising from a biomining perspective is also a region named Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT), characterized by high percentage of potassium, REEs, phosphorus and thorium (Taylor et al. 2006). Owing to the large number of different types of asteroids, specific cases should be considered when discussing asteroid biomining. Meteorites are made of material from diverse planetary bodies, including asteroids (Housen et al. 1979), but asteroid composition varies widely depending on the type. A complete description of asteroidal composition is beyond the scope of this review; however, information comes largely from the analysis of available meteorites, which are mainly chondrites (Lewis 1992; Yoshizaki and McDonough 2021). Meteorites can be divided into stony, stony-iron and iron. Stony chondritic meteorites are a class of undifferentiated meteorites that are highly interesting from the biomining perspective and compose the large part of those that fall on Earth. Composition varies largely between types. Carbonaceous chondrites (C chondrites) are particularly rich in organic compounds, nitrogen and sulphur; enstatite chondrites (E chondrites) are highly reduced and contain silicon, iron, nickel and sulphides; the most abundant group falls in the intermediate categories of H, L and LL chondrites, with free metal elements, decreasing iron content and a lower presence of sulphur in respect to the former two (Lewis 1992). Water, volatiles, organic compounds, elements as the platinum group elements (PGE: platinum, osmium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and iridium) and more common metals such as iron or nickel can be present, in quantities depending on the asteroid type (Klas et al. 2015; Steenstra et al. 2018, 2020). Sulphur depletion on some asteroids and meteorite surfaces has been documented, as a consequence of space weathering of iron sulphides (Matsumoto et al. 2020). To mention a few notable asteroid examples, 21 Lutetia has a metal-rich composition with mafic silicate minerals poor in iron and hydrated minerals (Coradini et al. 2011), Ceres is rich in hydrated minerals, ammoniated phyllosilicates and carbonates, salts and organic material (De Sanctis et al. 2017). Similarly, 24 Themis (Campins et al. 2010) and Bennu (Lauretta et al. 2019) have water and organic compounds on their surface. Samples from Itokawa (S-type asteroid), obtained in the Hayabusa mission, revealed not only a composition similar to LL-chondrites, but also provided insights into regolith composition and properties (Tsuchiyama et al. 2011).We will shortly have data from the JAXA Hayabusa2 and the NASA OSIRIS-Rex missions on the returning samples from Ryugu and Bennu, respectively. Crucial within the context of all these materials is that, when they are added to a liquid water environment for biomining, they do not result in water activity levels or toxicity that makes them uninhabitable for biomining organisms. Unless the parent material contains high concentrations of salts (e.g., NaCl) there is no a priori reason why any of the materials discussed above should result in unsuitable water activities. The potential toxicity caused by ions (e.g., heavy metals) will depend on the material and the organisms used, but clearly this must be considered for any given combination of minerals and biomining organisms proposed (Averesch 2021). Terrestrial biomining mechanisms and space applicability Bioleaching can be performed by chemolithotrophic and organotrophic microorganisms (Asghari et al. 2013; Srichandan et al. 2019). In most cases, consortia of microorganisms and biofilm formation have an important role in improving and enhancing biomining, compared to single-species approaches. Moreover, biotechnological and synthetic biology techniques can be applied to ameliorate microbial resistance to toxic compounds and enhance metal extraction. All these concepts can be applied to space biomining. Chemolithotroph microorganisms This first group includes the most commonly used and characterized biomining organisms, autotrophic iron-oxidising and/or sulphur-oxidising microorganisms which thrive at low pH. Low pH allows many metal ions, such as iron, to remain in solution, although neutral-pH biomining is possible (Blowes et al. 2003). These microorganisms include mesophilic bacteria (optimum 28–37 °C), moderate thermophilic bacteria (40–60 °C) and thermophile chemolithotrophs (60–80 °C), which commonly belong to archaea (Bosecker 1997; Asghari et al. 2013; Srichandan et al. 2019). The genera Acidithiobacillus, Thiobacillus and Leptospirillium contain a large proportion of these microorganisms, and they have been often isolated from mine-drainage sites (Blowes et al. 2003). Some archaea include the genera Acidianus, Ferroplasma, Metallosphaera and Sulfolobus (Schippers et al. 2013). Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, an iron and sulphur oxidizing microorganism, and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, a strictly sulphur oxidizing bacterium, are two of the most commonly used bacteria in bioleaching (Levicán et al. 2008). On Earth, metals of interest are often embedded into sulphidic minerals (e.g., iron in pyrite FeS2, copper in chalcopyrite CuFeS2, and molybdenum in molybdenite MoS2). The processes of metal dissolution performed by chemolithotrophs includes the biological oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, which in turn oxidises the sulphide mineral to sulphate and sulphuric acid. This latter maintains the low pH required to improve metal solubilisation (Olson et al. 2003; Asghari et al. 2013; Schippers et al. 2013; Singh and Cameotra 2015; Marrero et al. 2020). Metal sulphide dissolution can occur by two main pathways, depending on the mineral species (i.e., electronic configuration and consequent reactivity to proton attack) and named after the intermediate that is formed: (a) thiosulphate (S2O32−) pathway, enabling the solubilization of acid-insoluble metal sulphides minerals, and (b) polysulphide (H2Sn) pathway, which can solubilize acid-soluble minerals (Schippers and Sand 1999; Rohwerder et al. 2003; Marrero et al 2020). The latter can be solubilized by sulphur-oxidizing bacteria, since the process does not necessarily require Fe3+. These microorganisms are also required to dissolve the elemental sulphur which is formed during the process (Rohwerder et al. 2003). Metal sulphide dissolution can occur by contact and non-contact mechanisms, although it has been recently suggested that the two mechanisms are similar (Sand et al. 2001; Rohwerder et al. 2003; Srichandan et al. 2019). Details on these, and on the importance of biofilms for bioleaching, are discussed in Sect. 3.2.4. More recently, reductive dissolution of ferric ion in oxidized ores (e.g. laterites) from A. ferrooxidans has been demonstrated. In this process, anaerobic conditions can be used as Fe3+ is the terminal electron acceptor (Hallberg et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2013; Singh and Cameotra 2015). Elemental sulphur is, however, required as an energy source (Hallberg et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2013; Singh and Cameotra 2015), and the mechanisms still need to be fully elucidated (Singh and Cameotra 2015; Marrero et al. 2020). The use of chemolithotroph microorganisms in space biomining has two main advantages: first, the mechanisms have been widely characterized and second, they do not require the presence of organic compounds to grow (Averesch 2021). Growth, interaction and metal extraction from space rocks/regolith or analogues using chemolithotroph microorganisms have been demonstrated (González-Toril et al. 2005; Gronstal et al. 2009; Kölbl et al. 2017; Tait et al. 2017; Milojevic et al. 2021). However, as discussed in Sect. 3.1, mineral composition of space rocks of biomining interest can differ widely not only among planetary bodies, but also within the same planet or asteroid. This type of bioleaching microorganisms could not be applied, or be less efficient, to space rocks with low sulphur content, for instance the Moon, some asteroids and potentially some Martian regions (Fig. 1, see also Sect. 3.1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Diagram summarizing the main types of biomining/bioleaching microorganisms and mechanisms, and their potential space applicability taking into account the general surface composition and mineral content of Mars, Moon and asteroids. The central ‘bioengineering’ panel highlights the potential use of bioengineering and synthetic biology approaches to enhance and overcome possible limitations of wild type microorganisms. Sphere colour indicates the tentative applicability to planetary bodies, based on the general crust composition. Other parameters (atmosphere, pressure, gravity, temperature, etc.) have not been considered hereOrganotroph microorganisms The second group of bioleaching microorganisms includes organotrophic bacteria and fungi. These are heterotrophic organisms which require organic compounds as a source of carbon for their metabolism, and they can solubilize oxidic, silicious and carbonaceous materials (Asghari et al. 2013). The metal solubilization of the ore occurs by the action of (i) organic acids or (ii) hydrogen cyanide produced by the bacterial or fungal cell. In this case, bioleaching can occur at circumneutral or slightly alkaline pH (Bosecker 1997). (i) Regarding the first mechanism, fungi have been particularly characterized for their organic acid-mediated bioleaching capacity, which can occur by (a) acidolysis, (b) complexolysis, (c) redoxolysis and (d) bioaccumulation (Asghari et al. 2013; Srichandan et al. 2019). (a) In acidolysis, protons from the organic acid react with the mineral surface, weakening the bonds and consequently releasing the metal of interest. Concurrently, (b) complexolysis can also happen, in which complexation between the metal and the organic acid, or more rarely amminoacids (Maneesuwannarat et al. 2019), occurs. (c) During redoxolysis, metal solubilization is promoted by its enzymatic oxidation or reduction, while in (d) bioaccumulation the soluble metal ions can be transported through the cell membrane and accumulate as solid particle within the cell or in vacuoles (Asghari et al. 2013; Srichandan et al. 2019). The organic acids identified to be associated with bioleaching include citric acid, gluconic acid, oxalic acid, citramalic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid and itaconic acid (Gadd 1999; Adeleke et al. 2010; Amin et al. 2014; Brisson et al. 2016, 2020). Fungal bioleaching species include, but is not limited to, Penicillium spp. (Franz et al. 1991; Bosecker 1997; Ambreen et al. 2002; Adeleke et al. 2010), Aspergillus spp, (Brisson et al. 2016; Din et al. 2020) and Paecilomyces spp. (Brisson et al. 2016, 2020). Bacterial species include Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Bacillus spp. (Reed et al. 2016; Rozas et al. 2017; Barnett et al. 2018; Giese et al. 2019). Brisson and colleagues (Brisson et al. 2020) recently performed a thorough metabolomic study which suggested that bioleaching of a given element could be mediated by specific organic acids, rather than organic acids in general. (ii) The second group of organotrophic bioleaching microorganisms include species producing hydrogen cyanide (HCN, also called cyanogenic microorganisms), that use glycine for its production. HCN formation is usually an aerobic process (Srichandan et al. 2019). These organisms can perform bioleaching at mild temperatures (25–35 °C) and a circum-neutral to basic pH (7–11; Valix 2017). Cyanide forms complexes with the metals, whose solubility in water and chemical stability are highly increased. Many metal and metalloids, including precious elements such as gold, platinum and silver, have been successfully extracted from electronic waste using cyanogenic microorganisms, which include Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli and Chromobacterium violaceum (Valix 2017). Notably, cyanobacteria have been shown to perform bioleaching as well (Cecal et al. 2000; Singh 2020). Despite being autotrophic organisms, their bioleaching mechanisms are similar to those of organotrophic microorganisms and involve biosorption through polysaccharides and organic acids (containing amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl and carbonyl groups) present on the cell surface and in biofilms (Huang et al. 2020; Singh 2020). Extraction of REEs and vanadium from basalt (Mars and Moon analogue rock) using organotrophic bacteria (Sphingomonas desiccabilis and Bacillus subtilis) was successfully performed on the ISS under Martian gravity and microgravity (Cockell et al. 2020, 2021), while copper, iron and magnesium were extracted by Cupriavidus metallidurans from basalt after three months of spaceflight (Byloos et al. 2017). Although used also for extraction from sulphide minerals (Johnson and Roberto 1997), these microorganisms are particularly useful for recovery of metals from non-sulphidic minerals and industrial waste that do not contain the sulphur necessary to sustain chemolithotroph growth (Asghari et al. 2013; Hosseini Nasab et al. 2020). Hence, organotrophic microorganisms with demonstrated biomining capacity could be applied to space biomining to extract elements from those rocks and regolith with low sulphur content, for instance lunar rocks (see also Sect. 3.1). A tentative diagram showing potential applications of biomining mechanisms to space, based on general surface composition of planetary bodies, is shown in Fig. 1. The diagram is not intended as exhaustive or definitive, as other parameters have not been considered, but it shows that careful selection of biomining mechanisms and microorganisms is needed when planning for space applications, as indeed for any space bioengineering and biomanufacturing process (Averesch 2021).Biomining consortia Consortia of microorganisms, rather than single species, are often used in biomining, as they can perform different reactions which eventually lead to the metal extraction (Rawlings and Johnson 2007). In many cases the consortium has increased bioleaching efficacy. Qiu et al. (2015) showed how bioleaching of copper from chalcopyrite was enhanced in a co-culture of A. ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans compared to single cultures (Qiu et al. 2005). The roles that microorganisms can perform in a consortium include the oxidation of the ferrous fraction, the generation of a low pH by oxidation of the sulphur moiety and consequent acidification of the solutions, and the degradation of the organic compounds formed in the process (Johnson 2018). Although some bioleaching microorganisms can perform multiple roles (e.g., A. ferrooxidans), others can perform a single role in the process, such as A. thiooxidans, being a strict sulphur-oxidizing bacterium (Blowes et al. 2003; Levicán et al. 2008). Heterotrophic consortia and mixes of heterotrophic–autotrophic consortia have also been studied (Bryan et al. 2015; Valix 2017). Selection of the appropriate consortium for a given biomining application can occur by a “top-down” approach, in which a mix of microorganisms is naturally selected by growing in the presence of a certain mineral, or by a “bottom-up” approach, in which a consortium is designed by selecting required parameters (Rawlings and Johnson 2007). Bioengineering of consortia has been also attempted (Rawlings and Johnson 2007; Brune and Bayer 2012; Gumulya et al. 2018). All these approaches are promising from a space biomining perspective, although they may be limited by the necessity to optimize consortia using rock and regolith simulant, when real space samples are not available. The possibility to use heterotrophic organisms for non-sulphidic mineral dissolution in space biomining has been discussed. While using these microorganisms may present many other advantages (Averesch 2021), one disadvantage is certainly their requirement for a carbon source. This could be overcome by using a consortium containing heterotrophic biomining microorganisms and cyanobacteria: the latter could produce the organic compounds, and the oxygen, necessary to sustain growth and organic acid production (Verseux et al. 2016; Billi et al. 2021) necessary for biomining in space, without the need to provide these nutrients from external sources. The oxygen production would be useful, as it could sustain aerobic biomining in general. Moreover, cyanobacteria (particularly Anabaena cylindrica) have been demonstrated to successfully leach mineral elements from basalt and anorthosite (Olsson-Francis and Cockell 2010). An attempt to test the efficacy of bioleaching of asteroidal material performed by a small artificial heterotrophic consortium (the bacterium S. desiccabilis plus the fungus P. simplicissimum) in microgravity has been completed on the ISS (BioAsteroid, data in preparation).The role of biofilm formation Microbially mediated leaching of sulphidic minerals can occur by contact and non-contact interaction, although it has been recently suggested that the two mechanisms overlap. In the case of direct interaction, the microbial cell is in contact with the mineral surface through the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and the sulphur fraction is oxidised to sulphate by the Fe3+-glucuronic acids complex in the EPS. In the non-contact mechanism, instead, the microbial planktonic cell acts by oxidizing the Fe2+ and reduced sulphur species that are dissolved in the solution (Sand et al. 2001; Blowes et al. 2003). Biofilm formation is important for both interactions, as it not only enhances the contact of microbial cells with the rock surface, but also increases the concentration of ions and compounds that allow bioleaching, the communication between cells of same or different species, and the resistance to toxic metals and compounds (Noël et al. 2010; Bellenberg et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2014; Gumulya et al. 2018). Indeed, biofilm enhances organotrophic bioleaching as well, through the action of the compounds embedded in the matrix (EPS), including polysaccharides and organic acids (Rohwerder et al. 2003; Yu et al. 2014; Gumulya et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2020). When biofilms may limit the access to the substrate, microorganisms have been demonstrated to modify EPS accordingly (Rohwerder et al. 2003). Many studies on biofilm formation in space demonstrated the production of thicker or structural different biofilms during spaceflights (McLean et al. 2001; Zea et al. 2018, 2020). A study conducted on board the ISS interrogated biofilm formation and found that, under certain conditions, a novel “column and canopy” structure was observed in microgravity (Kim et al. 2013). The BioRock experiment studied microbe–mineral interaction and bioleaching from basalt rock of three heterotrophic bacterial species, showing a positive biofilm formation for S. desiccabilis and C. metallidurans within the rock surface under all the gravity condition tested (microgravity, Martian and terrestrial gravities), particularly around edges and cavities (Santomartino et al. in preparation). S. desiccabilis and B. subtilis were able to extract useful elements under different gravity regimens during the same experiment, suggesting an uninfluential role of gravity on microbial bioleaching mechanisms (Cockell et al. 2020, 2021). The data on biofilm formation and growth will, therefore, provide useful insights into the effects of biofilm formation in space biomining.Bioengineering In the presence of mine ore or waste, microbial growth can be hindered by toxic compounds, heavy metals and stressor factors. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that many extremotolerant and extremophilic microorganisms have been isolated as bioleaching agents. This characteristic of bioleaching organisms is, by itself, of great use when considering space biomining, since extraterrestrial regolith can often bear toxic compounds, such as perchlorates (Hecht et al. 2009; Wadsworth and Cockell 2017). When not endogenous, resistance could be developed by adaptive evolution, random mutagenesis or bioengineering and synthetic biology approaches (Gumulya et al. 2018). Engineering of single species or a microbial consortium to enhance desired characteristics, or reduce the impact of the undesired ones, is possible, although the success rate of the engineering approach depend on the recalcitration of some microorganisms to genetic manipulation (Rawlings and Johnson 2007; Brune and Bayer 2012; Johnson et al. 2013). Synthetic biology approaches can be used to improve the tolerance, and therefore the output, of biomining microorganisms. The concept is not trivial, as bioengineering has been optimized for a few microbial species (e.g., E. coli strains), mainly heterotrophic (Averesch 2021), while tools are rarely available for environmental and undomesticated samples. Gumulya et al. (2018) provides a list of tools developed specifically for a few biomining microorganisms, including A. ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans. In many cases, synthetic biology has been used to improve the resistance of E. coli strains to acid, thermal or heavy metal stress, to mention a few. This is achieved by heterologous expression of proteins of interest, often isolated from bioleaching microorganisms (Gumulya et al. 2018). Nevertheless, attempts to engineer specific biomining microorganisms (Gumulya et al. 2018) and biofilms for biomining applications (Buetti-Dinh et al. 2020) have been performed as well. Deinococcus radiodurans, also known for its astrobiological relevant properties such as resistance to polyextremes and space conditions, has been engineered to enhance its bioremediation capacity (Daly 2000). Attempts to genetically enhance acidophilic biomining microorganisms have been reported (reviewed in Gumulya et al. 2018), for instance by expressing arsenic resistance and rusticyanin proteins in A. ferrooxidans (Liu et al. 2011, 2013). Although synthetic biology applications to biomining are still young, approaches to ameliorate resistance to space conditions, to enhance extraction of elements under these, or overcome issues, could be an excellent opportunity for space biomining, and a wide variety of possible applications have been reported (Cockell 2011; Montague et al. 2012; Menezes et al. 2015b; Rothschild 2016; Verseux et al. 2016). Notably, the importance of synthetic biology approaches for ISRU has been proposed (Cockell 2011; Menezes et al. 2015b; Rothschild 2016; Nangle et al. 2020; Averesch 2021).Space biomining applications Biomining in the context of ISRU and self-sustaining extraterrestrial settlements One of the most relevant applications for space biomining is in ISRU. In particular, Bio-ISRU refers to the use of biotechnologies to achieve the exploitation of resources from planetary bodies (Brown et al. 2008). However, myriad resources will need to be acquired and processed in situ to enable self-sustaining settlements in space, and many commodities will likely require a combination of physico-chemical and biological approaches (Keller et al. 2021). Transportation to and from the settlement and Earth, and between settlements, will require fuel for the transport vehicles. While methane production for Martian architecture (Ash et al. 1978; Musk 2017) may be partly done via biological methods (Klas et al. 2015), oxygen and hydrogen extraction from lunar regolith for chemically based propulsion (Jamanca-Lino 2021) will likely be performed via physico-chemical processes (Schwandt et al. 2012). Other essential resources arise from human needs: water, oxygen, atmospheric pressure, food and waste management. Water can be found in permanently shadowed craters on the Moon and in different locations on Mars and asteroids; this water can also serve to meet oxygen needs. Oxygen and an inert gas like N2 will be needed to reach required atmospheric pressures (Niederwieser et al. 2019). In this context, biomining could be one of the methods to provide the structural metals (e.g., iron, nickel, vanadium, copper) for construction of buildings and machinery, or to build electronic devices and magnets (e.g., REEs, silicon; Cockell 2010, 2011; Montague et al. 2012; Menezes et al. 2015b; Rothschild 2016; Verseux et al. 2016). Bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to recycle useful elements from electric waste (Brandl et al. 1999; Rozas et al. 2017; Srichandan et al. 2019). Apart from structural materials, bioleaching of regolith and rocks could provide water, useful volatiles (e.g., oxygen from the dissolution of oxide minerals, hydrogen, carbon, sulphur) and mineral nutrients (e.g., potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, sulphur) essential for life (Cockell 2010, 2011; Montague et al. 2012; Menezes et al. 2015b; Rothschild 2016; Verseux et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2020). Biomining is not intrinsically a traditional part of BLSS (Eckart 1992). However, the principal and secondary (e.g., waste) products from bioleaching discussed so far could be used to sustain biological compartments in life-support systems, including human crew (see for instance the ESA’s MELiSSA life support project; Gòdia et al. 2002; Lasseur and Mergeay 2021). In turn, bioleaching microorganisms (particularly aerobic and heterotrophic ones) could benefit from waste materials produced from the regenerative support system (Billi et al. 2021; Keller et al. 2021). Considering all this, the addition of a biomining/bioleaching compartment could be a beneficial addition to supply basic chemical requirements for a BLSS, and vice versa (Fig. 2). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Conceptual figure of a biomining/bioleaching compartment in the context of BLSS, based on the regenerative life-support systems MELiSSA project design (Gòdia et al. 2002; Lasseur and Mergeay 2021). Potential useful elements produced by this compartment are shown in orangeBioremediation Similar chemical reactions to those involved in biomining are used to perform bioremediation on Earth, to eliminate toxic and polluting compounds from soil and waters (Gadd 2010). Extremophiles and extremotolerant microorganisms (Jeong and Choi 2020), fungi (e.g., Aspergillus and Penicillium spp.; Yamada-Onodera et al. 2002; Din et al. 2020) and other bacterial species (for instance Sphingomonas; Chen 2012) are often used. The capacity to remove heavy metals, radioactive species (uranium), acids (including acid mine drainage produced through mining and biomining processes), organic pollutants and salts has been demonstrated (Gadd 2010; Brune and Bayer 2012). It is worth mentioning that many of these species can indeed thrive in (extremophiles and polyextremophiles) or tolerate (extremotolerant and polyextremotolerant) a variety of extreme conditions, which might come in handy in space. To mention a few examples, many chemolithotrophic microorganisms used in biomining, such as Acidithiobacillus and Ferroplasma, are acidophiles, while Sulfolobus and Metallosphaera are both acidophiles and thermophiles (Rohwerder et al. 2003; Coker 2016). Regarding organotrophic microorganisms, A. niger spores demonstrated resistance to high doses of radiations (Cortesão et al. 2020), while S. desiccabilis biofilms could withstand desiccation and Martian brines (Stevens et al. 2019), for instance. The lunar and Martian surfaces contain a number of toxic compounds that could hinder not only biomining, but also the settlement itself. Examples include perchlorates on Mars (Hecht et al. 2009; Kounaves et al. 2014) and toxic lunar dusts (Linnarsson et al. 2012). Microorganisms performing biomining could also be selected for bioremediation approaches to ameliorate these components by making them less toxic or removing them. A recent study identified the genes involved in perchlorate resistance from microorganisms isolated from the Atacama desert (Díaz-Rullo et al. 2021). A Chroococcidiopsis species and its derivate (CCMEE 029 and CCMEE 029 P-MRS, respectively) had no negative effect to perchlorate exposure, and the biomass produced could be used to feed an heterotrophic bacterial species (E. coli; Billi et al. 2021). A new record for perchlorate tolerance was reported for the fungus Planococcus halocryophilus (Heinz et al. 2020). Shewanella onediensis was found slightly impacted by perchlorates (Volger et al. 2020), and it was able to reduce chromium, although growth was inhibited at high concentrations of this metal (Middleton et al. 2003). Moreover, biofilms could be used to settle dangerous dusts and enrich regolith with nutritious elements, which will allow the fertilization of soils (Liu et al. 2008; Cockell 2011; Mergelov et al. 2018; Eichler et al. 2021).Asteroid biomining The concept of asteroid mining is slightly different and deserves a separate discussion. While biomining on Mars and the Moon will likely have the aim to directly sustain extraterrestrial settlements located on these planetary bodies, there is no current interest in creating a stable human presence on asteroids (although in the long term this could change). This poses the problem of transporting the extracted materials to their final destination, hence the viability of the process depends on the costs, which depend on the richness of elements and their location (Gertsch 1992), and of course on the engineering constraints. Asteroids of interest from the biomining perspective belong to either the near-Earth objects or the asteroid belt, beyond Mars orbit. For lunar settlements or return to Earth, near-Earth objects could be more appropriate, while for Martian settlements objects from asteroid belt could be used (Gaffey 1992; Gertsch 1992). Molecules of interest from the asteroid biomining perspective are water, volatiles and carbon compounds, expensive (PGE, gold, silver) and common metals (Klas et al. 2015). We discussed in Sect. 3.1.v the wide variety of asteroids and their composition, as well as the fact that our knowledge on these is limited by data coming from the available meteorites and the few returning samples from space missions (Metzger and Britt 2020). It has been estimated that the total number of minor asteroids in the asteroid belt is highly underestimated (Krasinsky et al. 2002). These considerations imply that a wider knowledge on asteroid type and composition is necessary to select objects of interest for space biomining. Asteroid biomining is gaining increasing interest, and a variety of companies are forming to develop engineering strategies (Lewicki et al. 2013), and scientists are assessing microbial growth and colonization of meteorites (Klas et al. 2015; Tait et al. 2017; Milojevic et al. 2019), including the abovementioned BioAsteroid experiment, showing bacterial and fungal mediated leaching of an L-chondrite on the ISS (data under analysis).Benefits for Earth Scientific research topics are naturally interconnected. Owing to the harshness of the space environment, space exploration requires the most advanced human ingenuity and scientific technologies. Once these are developed, they would be available for terrestrial applications and benefit the quality of life on Earth (ISECG 2013). Space microbiology also has a significant impact in our everyday life (Horneck et al. 2010). With this view in mind, it is expected that advances in space biomining will eventually benefit terrestrial biomining technologies (Metzger 2016). It has been proposed that biomining of specific planetary bodies, for instance some asteroids and even the Moon (Carter 1992), could provide useful elements for terrestrial use. However, at present this has not been found to be a viable opportunity. Nevertheless, many realistic benefits can be listed. As mentioned before, the BioRock experiment demonstrated the ability of S. desiccabilis to extract REEs and vanadium under a variety of gravity conditions on the ISS (Cockell et al. 2020, 2021). This was the first demonstration of the ability of S. desiccabilis to perform biomining, providing a novel microorganism for terrestrial applications. Improvement of biomining technologies, including amelioration of strains for the extraction of elements from low-grade ores and under extreme conditions could provide tools for similar aims on Earth. Designing of highly efficient biomining reactors and hardware would be another applicable benefit. The same concept could be easily applied to bioremediation, hence to environmental issues as follows: microorganisms with demonstrated tolerance and capacity to bioaccumulate and remediate toxic compounds under the harsh Martian and lunar conditions could be used for terrestrial purposes, or inform us on how to achieve similar goals here. Augmentation of sustainable approaches by learning from space biotechnologies will be a great benefit for Earth. The major space agencies aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (https://sdgs.un.org/goals), and these principles can be applied to human space exploration. Biomining is widely recognized to be more environmental friendly in respect to traditional mining approaches (Jerez 2017a); hence learning how to improve bioleaching from advancements in the challenging field of space biomining would also have a positive environmental impact on Earth. Moreover, improving the design of self-sustaining extraterrestrial settlements, for instance by including a biomining compartment, electronic waste recycling and synthetic biology approaches to engineer biomining microorganisms to use different waste as nutrients (e.g., plastics), would inform on terrestrial strategies to improve circular economy approaches.Conclusions As the goal for space exploration expands toward establishing permanent settlements in space, space biomining is generating an increasing interest. The main space agencies have recognized its potential in their roadmaps. Many are the advantages, as terrestrial biomining is considered a sustainable approach in both the economic and environmental terms (Jerez 2017a). Moreover, many rocks in the Solar System would be considered low-grade ores for terrestrial standards (Cockell and Santomartino, in press), and biomining on Earth is commonly used to process mine waste, dumps and tailings (Bosecker 1997; Mishra and Rhee 2014). The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to bioremediation, recycling of waste and to support BLSS. Although promising, the science around space biomining is still relatively young. Considering the differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions, including rock type and ore availability, a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be always possible. Energetic and metabolic demands need to be taken into account. Engineering requirements for space biomining reactors will require temperature controls, aeration and stirring under complex and harsh conditions. While most terrestrial biomining knowledge is based on autotrophic microorganisms able to break down sulphidic minerals without the need of carbon compounds, many rocks in the Solar Systems may present a low sulphur content. In these cases, heterotrophic microorganisms could be a better choice, but they would require organic compounds. Moreover, most bioleaching reactions are aerobic, and oxygen itself will be a commodity in space. A careful selection of the most appropriate techniques and microorganisms will be required for any given application, and the optimal solution could include complementary systems (Averesch 2021). Ethic and planetary protection discussions are outside of the aim of this review. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take them into account when planning the preferred method for mining or ISRU in a specific region or planetary body, as they could pose a further limitation. Biomining is one of the possible approaches to achieve ISRU, and its selection over other methods should at least consider all the parameters discussed here. Nevertheless, its advantages make it pivotal to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications. This includes learning more on the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expanding our knowledge on organotrophic, cyanobacteria and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, on anaerobic biomining, and investigating the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations.Acknowledgements Rosa Santomartino and Charles S.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacterial behavior has been studied under microgravity conditions, but very little is known about it under lunar and Martian gravitational regimes. An Earth-based approach was designed and implemented using inclined clinostats and an in-house-developed code to determine the optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures of 5 RPM. With this setup, growth dynamics, phenotypic changes, and sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for three Escherichia coli strains (including uropathogenic) were examined under simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. The results included increased growth under simulated micro- and lunar gravities for some strains, and higher concentrations of antibiotics needed under simulated lunar gravity with respect to simulated micro- and Martian gravities. Clinostat-produced results can be considered suggestive but not determinative of what might be expected in altered gravity, as there is still a need to systematically verify these simulation devices’ ability to accurately replicate phenomena observed in space. Nevertheless, this approach serves as a baseline to start interrogating key cellular and molecular aspects relevant to microbial processes on the lunar and Martian surfaces.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Humans carry roughly as many bacterial cells in and on our bodies as we have total mammalian cells [1]. By the nature of this, we will ubiquitously share space habitats with bacteria. Hence, it is important to understand how an altered gravitational environment may affect bacterial behavior and, in the context of human health concerns, the efficacy of antibiotics. Although no overarching definitive conclusions have yet been reached [2,3], many studies performed in space have shown altered bacterial behavior in microgravity with respect to 1 g on Earth [4], including modified cell and biofilm phenotype [5,6,7,8], increased virulence [9], and reduced bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics [7,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. While these studies have interrogated bacterial behavior and its potential consequences for crew health in the microgravity environment of orbital flight, very little is known on these topics under lunar and Martian gravitational regimes, 1.62 m/s2 (~⅙ g) and 3.72 m/s2 (~⅜ g), respectively. Of particular interest are processes related to urinary tract infections (UTI) given that urosepsis (which can occur if a UTI is not treated properly) is the third most likely reason for emergent medical evacuation from the International Space Station (ISS) [23]. Escherichia coli is the most commonly isolated UTI pathogen [24], and is also typically used as a bacterial model organism for spaceflight research [19]. As part of a NASA-funded study using ten microbes (results of other species to be published separately), this manuscript describes experiments focused on characterizing growth dynamics (lag phase duration, exponential growth rate, and final cell counts at stationary phase), phenotypic changes (cell diameter and length and aggregation), and the sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for three E. coli strains cultured under simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. Our methodology to simulate some aspects of these gravitational conditions—inclined clinostats and a code to determine an optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures—are also explained.",
    "methods": "3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Setup E. coli AMG1 and its mutant strain were cultured in modified artificial urine medium supplemented with glucose and a high concentration of phosphate (mAUMg hi-Pi) [5,44] to replicate human urine. While glucose concentrations in human urine are usually 0 to 0.8 mM or lower [45], our growth medium had a higher concentration, 2 mM, for comparison against our group’s other spaceflight studies (to be published separately) and to ensure bacterial growth would take place, enabling us to interrogate the role of simulated gravitational conditions. E. coli 4157 was cultured in LB lennox broth (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, L3022). All strains were grown at 37 °C. Cultures were housed in BioServe’s FPAs, enclosed by rubber septa, and then loaded into BioServe’s FPA clinostats (Figure 1). Washing, sigmacoting®, and sterilization was performed on all hardware prior to experimentation, per Zea et al. [20]. 3.2. Bacterial Motility To determine the motility of each strain, a needle dipped in bacterial culture was inserted into motility tubes (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. R061410) and was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. A motile culture was indicated by a dispersion of pink color resulting from the bacterial reduction of Tetrazolium (TTC), a metabolite within the agar (Figure 3). The motility tests showed that E. coli AMG1 was semi motile, E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS was motile, and E. coli ATCC 4157 was non-motile. Figure 3. Open in a new tab AMG1 was semi motile, AMG1 ∆rpoS was motile, and ATCC 4157 was non-motile. 3.3. Experimental Approach A 24-h culture was diluted by 1:100 and loaded into the FPAs. The optical density (OD)595 at the start of the experiment was 0.002 on average. The FPA consisted of four independent chambers, each containing 1.3 mL of culture, segregated by rubber septa. One FPA was sacrificed at each timestamp for OD data acquisition (the last timestamp had eight replicates for improved statistics). Timestamps were determined by preliminary growth curve experiments conducted at 1 g, and in the case of the E. coli AMG1 and E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS strains, were based on the timeline presented in Pagden et al. [40]. Additional FPAs were loaded with 10 mL of culture each for supplemental analyses, including microscopy. For the antibiotic sensitivity experiments, each FPA had two independent chambers, each containing 3 mL of culture, and enough FPAs were loaded so that there were four replicates for each tested antibiotic concentration, per each gravitational condition. The desired antibiotic concentration was prepared with the same media used in the bacterial culture as diluent and was filter sterilized. In each test, four concentrations were assessed. Drugs (Ciprofloxacin (Fisher Sci., Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. AC456880050) or Gentamicin Sulfate (Fisher Sci., Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. BP918-1)) were introduced in the bacterial culture when they reached exponential phase. At this time, two FPAs per gravitational regime were sacrificed for OD data acquisition to quantify cell concentration at the time of antibiotic introduction. Then, the four antibiotic concentrations were introduced to their respective FPAs by injecting 1 mL of antibiotic into each chamber. All FPAs were returned to their FPA Clinostat and environmental test chamber at 37 °C for 12 additional hours, following the MIC protocol described by Andrews [46], adapted to be implementable in this spaceflight hardware. In this assay, bacterial cultures are challenged with increasing concentrations of antibiotics to find the minimum concentration of a given drug sufficient to inhibit bacterial growth under those conditions. Growth inhibition is determined by statistically comparing cell concentration after 12 h of drug challenge against the cell concentration at the time of antibiotic introduction. 3.4. Code to Determine Clinostat Rotational Speed One of the unique attributes of microgravity at the cellular level in a liquid medium is an altered extracellular mass transport profile. On Earth, a cell in a liquid medium will be subject to gravity-driven forces and resultant flows, including sedimentation, buoyancy, and convection, which help transport molecules from one location to another. In microgravity, however, and for non-motile cells in particular, mass transport is limited to diffusion arising from Brownian motion, surface effects, and/or gradient-driven transport phenomena, translating into a quiescent, quasi-stable extracellular environment where incoming substrate is thought to become limited, and excreted metabolic byproducts accumulate around a cell [20,33]. Some aspects of this quiescent environment can be replicated using a clinostat on Earth to continuously rotate a vessel filled with a liquid culture, with the caveat that the 1 g vector is never removed as it is operated on Earth. Thus, the suspended cells still experience their full weight. The angular speed (ω) at which this vessel is rotated is a function of cellular and medium properties, including but not limited to cell length and diameter (normalized into an equivalent Stoke’s radius (a), mass (m), buoyancy-corrected mass (m*), particle density (ρp), medium density (ρf), viscosity (ν), and Stoke’s drag constant (f), as well as the vessel diameter (d). If the vessel is rotated too slowly, the cell will sediment away from the quiescent zone; if it is rotated too quickly, however, the cell will be centrifuged out of the quiescent zone. The position of a particle at a given time (t) can be modeled based on the aforementioned parameters via two second order, linear, separable, non-homogenous stiff differential equations [25,27,47]: x¨+fmx˙−m*mω2x=−m*gmsinωt (1) y¨+fmy˙−m*mω2y=−m*gmcosωt (2) where x and y refer to the axes of a coordinate system upon which the vessel’s circular cross section is centered at the (0,0) position. We developed a MATLAB® code based on the ode15 s ordinary differential equation solver [27], to determine the longest duration a cell would stay within the putative quiescent zone under these conditions as a function of angular speed (accessible here: https://github.com/SpaceLuisZea/Clinostat) (accessed on 9 August 2022). As inputs to the code, we used a bacterial Stoke’s diameter of 5.6×10−5 cm, cell mass of 4.0×10−13 g, growth medium viscosity of 0.0102 g/cm·s and density of 1.011 g/cm3 (for reference, water’s viscosity at 25 °C and density are 0.0091 g/cm·s and 1.000 g/cm3, respectively), and an arbitrary quiescent zone diameter of 10 µm. This information (as well as recommended rotational speed) has been shared with other groups who have used our clinostats and FPAs [48]. 3.5. Data Acquisition Cultures were extracted and transferred into a 24-well plate for mixing, and from there aliquots were transferred to a 96-well plate. OD was measured at 595 nm for the growth curve and at 600 nm for MIC experiments. Cultures from the last timestamp of the growth curve for each regime were preserved by mixing 1 mL of 4% PFA (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. AAJ61899AK) and 1 mL of sample. For microscopy, samples were centrifuged for two to three minutes at 900 g’s and an aliquot was transferred to a slide. Microscopy was performed on an OLYMPUS.IX81 Inverted Widefield Microscope with a 100X 1.40NA SAPO objective lens and images were captured via a Hamamatsu Orca R2 CCD camera. 3.6. Statistical Analysis At each timestamp and for each gravitational regime, four replicates were sacrificed to acquire OD data. For each replicate, four aliquots were assessed, hence the OD for each regime at each timestamp was the mean of the averages of four aliquots per each of the four replicates. To determine if there were statistical differences between the gravitational regimes at 24 h, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for parametric datasets or Dunn test for nonparametric data sets was performed. Slopes between the beginning and end of the exponential phase were found using Microsoft Excel’s “slope” function. These slopes were compared to the 1 g control (slopegravitational regime/slope1 g). R2 values were found by using Excel’s RSQ function. This same process was used to calculate the “death rate” via the slope between the stationary phase and the last timepoint in the experiment. The average length and width were calculated for 50 measurements of each condition, preserved at the last timestamp. For MIC tests, a Tukey, Kruskal, or Dunn test was performed between OD at the time of antibiotic introduction and after 12 h of being challenged with antibiotics. The lowest concentration for which there was no significance with respect to the OD at time of drug introduction was the MIC.",
    "results": "4. Results 4.1. Calculated Time to Depart a Putative 10 µm Depletion Zone We used our MATLAB® code to simulate and subsequently determine how long it would take a non-motile bacterial cell to leave a depletion zone of 10 µm in diameter as a function of rotational speed and vessel diameter. Figure 4 shows the code output in this regard, indicating that for an FPA-like vessel (1 cm in diameter) and 5 RPM rotational speed, a non-motile bacterial cell could be expected to remain within this depletion zone (i.e., it would not sediment or be centrifuged away from it) for ~220 h, or just over nine days. Given that this was longer than our expected two-day long test, this RPM was chosen. Figure 4.

AMG1 and ∆rpoS Results 4.2.1. Growth Dynamics Figure 5 shows the growth dynamics of E. coli AMG1 and E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS under various simulated gravities. Limited by the times of data collection, the OD data indicate that the lag phase lasted to at least 1.25 h and 1 h for E. coli AMG1 and AMG1 ∆rpoS, respectively. The beginning and end of the exponential growth phase were 1.25 and 4.5 h for E. coli AMG1, and 3 and 5 h for AMG1 ∆rpoS, respectively. Slopes between these points are summarized in Table 1. Figure 5. Open in a new tab E. coli AMG1 and E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS growth in mAUMg-high Pi in various simulated gravities. Circles indicate E. coli AMG1, and triangles indicate the mutant strain. Error bars are standard error with a 95% confidence interval for this figure and all other data figures (n = 4 for all data points except the last timestamp, which has n = 8). Timestamps 6 and 24 h of the E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS dataset were moved to the right for clarity.Table 1.

At the 6 h timepoint, significance was only observed between simulated microgravity and the 1 g control (13% increase under simulated microgravity with respect to 1 g, p = 0.036). To maintain consistency between the strains, statistical analysis was performed at the 12 h timepoint as well. No significant differences were observed between any regimes for E. coli AMG1. For E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS, cultures grown under simulated lunar gravity and at 1 g reached the stationary phase at 6 h. Under simulated micro and Martian gravities, growth continued until at least 11.25 h. Statistical analysis was performed on data from 11.25 h and significant increases in OD were observed in simulated microgravity with respect to the other three gravitational conditions: simulated lunar (8% increase, p = 0.0099), simulated Martian gravity (15% increase, p < 0.001), and 1 g (35% increase, p < 0.001). When compared to the 1 g control, simulated lunar gravity exhibited significant differences (25% increase, p < 0.001), but not when compared to simulated Martian gravity. Finally, simulated Martian gravity exhibited significant differences when compared to the 1 g control (17% increase, p < 0.001). Comparison of OD between the strains under each gravitational condition shows significance only for the simulated microgravity regime (34% increase of AMG1 ∆rpoS with respect to AMG1, p = 0.003) (orange line in Figure 6). Figure 6. Open in a new tab E. coli AMG1 and E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS ODs at 12 h and 11.25 h (respectively) for each gravitational regime. Bars with the symbol ‘∆’ are data for the mutant strain.

Death rate slopes were calculated between these last two timepoints for each strain. This information is summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

Similarly, simulated lunar and Martian gravity showed significant increases when compared to the 1 g control (36% increase, p = 0.0037; 33% increase, p = 0.0132, respectively). No significance was observed when comparing simulated lunar to simulated Martian gravity. For the mutant strain, while no significant differences in OD were observed between the three reduced gravitational conditions at 24 h, each of them did show statistical differences with respect to the 1 g control. Simulated microgravity had a 44% increase (p < 0.001), simulated lunar gravity also had a 44% increase (p < 0.001), and simulated Martian gravity had a 31% increase (p < 0.001). Comparison between strains under each gravitational condition showed significantly higher ODs for the mutant with respect to AMG1 under simulated lunar (23% increase, p = 0.003) and under simulated Martian gravities (12% increase, p = 0.045) (orange lines in Figure 7).

Cell Size and Aggregation Length and width were measured for both strains at the last timestamp, 24 h. Table 3 indicates average cell length and width for each gravitational regime and strain, and how each compares to the 1 g controls. The simulated microgravity regime for the wild-type had the biggest size difference for both length (17% greater) and width (11% greater) compared to the 1 g control. The Dunn test was used to identify statistically significant differences in cell length and width as a function of gravitational regime and strain. Table 3.

For both strains, no aggregation was observed. Settling however did occur most of all in the 1 g control (FPAs oriented upright) and no settling was observed in simulated microgravity (FPAs oriented horizontally).4.2.3. MIC of Ciprofloxacin E. coli AMG1 and E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS were challenged, separately, with increasing concentrations of Ciprofloxacin (0, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.50 mg/L) to determine the minimum concentration of antibiotic needed to inhibit their growth under each gravitational condition. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic under which no statistical difference in OD600 (via Kruskal and Dunn tests) was observed between the time of drug introduction and 12 h later. As summarized in Table 4, lower concentrations of Ciprofloxacin were needed to inhibit E. coli AMG1 growth under the simulated reduced gravities with respect to the 1 g control, which continued growing under the highest concentration tested. It is noteworthy that the simulated microgravity and simulated Martian gravity conditions required half of what was needed under simulated lunar gravity to inhibit E. coli AMG1′s growth. Similarly, E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS growth was inhibited under simulated microgravity at a 0.50 mg/L concentration—a concentration that was not inhibitory under the other four tested gravitational conditions.

Exponential growth slopes were calculated between t = 1.5 and 6 h, and were compared to the 1 g control, as summarized in Table 5. The rate of growth during the exponential phase for each regime showed faster growth under the simulated reduced gravities with respect to 1 g, with no specific pattern: simulated lunar gravity had the highest growth rate, 14% greater than the 1 g control, followed by simulated Martian and microgravity (8 and 5% greater than the 1 g control, respectively).

    "discussion": "5. Discussion A clinostat may replicate certain aspects of the quiescent extracellular environment experienced in actual microgravity, but it is not the same as microgravity, as it operates on Earth, and thus weightlessness is not achieved. Furthermore, there are key aspects that need to be taken into account when designing reduced gravity experiments on Earth using simulation devices such as clinostats and rotating wall vessels. Namely, the importance of (i) the appropriate angular speed to minimize centrifugation and sedimentation of cells out of their proposed extracellular depletion zone, and of (ii) the use of the smallest diameter vessel possible. Our code indicated that clinorotating a 1 cm diameter vessel at 5 RPM would allow for bacteria to stay within a 10 µm depletion zone for about a week, more than sufficient for our two-day experiment. Given that centrifugal forces are dependent upon the distance between a cell and the axis of rotation, there is an advantage to having the smallest diameter culture vessel as possible, as a cell farther away from this axis will be centrifuged away from its depletion zone faster, hence limiting the duration of the clinostat experiment. In terms of the inclination of clinostats to simulate some aspects of gravity levels between micro and 1 g, the collinearity between cellular sedimentation and the axis of rotation, regardless of the angle of inclination, is a visual indication that this approach achieves the goal of effective axial g-vector alignment (see Figure 2). While our code has its limitations, namely that it does not include Brownian motion or cellular motility when applicable, nor does it take into account cellular aggregation, which is initially unknown, it serves as a first-order analysis to determine the best angular speed based on cellular and media parameters. We recommend that future iterations of this code—which is accessible here: https://github.com/SpaceLuisZea/Clinostat (accessed on 9 August 2022)—include Brownian motion, and that Monte Carlo simulations be run to obtain further numerical results. More importantly, it is acknowledged that a systematic verification of the validity of clinostats (and rotating wall vessels like HARV, and of random positioning machines, for that matter) needs to be performed by either including clinostat sets in spaceflight experiments, or flying experiments with clinorotated Earth controls (varying angular velocity, for example) with this very specific goal. Otherwise, simulated reduced gravity research performed in any of these types of simulation devices needs to be considered exploratory in nature and remains suggestive of what may be expected in microgravity, not determinative or conclusive in this regard, which also applies to this study. The growth dynamics results of our experiments indicate there is a direct correlation between motility and lag phase duration: the non-motile strain (4157) took less time to leave the lag phase (0.75 h), the semi motile strain (AMG1) took 1 h, and the motile strain (∆rpoS) took the longest (1.25 h). This correlation supports the theory that non-motile cells, in a quiescent extracellular environment like the one experienced in microgravity, are exposed to a relatively high concentration of their own byproducts and secondary metabolites [19,20,22], which may include quorum sensing molecules instructing the culture to begin exponential growth [4]. Comparing these results with those from spaceflight show that our observed reduced lag phase of E. coli 4157 matches our previous studies performed on the Space Shuttle [11,34,49]. This correlation may also be non-conclusively interpreted as an indication that the use of clinostats (specifically at 5 RPM and 1 cm diameter vessel), may indeed replicate certain aspects of microbial response in true microgravity. An important caveat to this comparative analysis is that the AMG1 and ∆rpoS strains were cultured in minimal media, whereas 4157 was in rich medium. Analyses of exponential growth rates showed that the AMG1 and ∆rpoS strains grew faster under simulated microgravity (17–23% increase with respect to 1 g); simulated lunar and Martian gravities either grew just as fast as simulated microgravity, or somewhere in between simulated microgravity and 1 g. The 4157 strain also showed a faster growth rate under the simulated reduced gravities with respect to 1 g, but in this case, simulated lunar gravity was the fastest growing (14% with respect to 1 g). Comparing these results with spaceflight data shows that these increases in exponential growth rate do not agree with the EcAMSat spaceflight mission, which found that the growth rate of AMG1 and ∆rpoS strains was unaltered by the microgravity environment [40], although it should be noted that it was acknowledged that their cells may have been under stress from the culturing hardware, and that different media were used in the two experiments. Similarly, Klaus et al. [34] found that the rate of growth for cells grown in microgravity was ‘unaffected (or slightly slower)’, again contrary to our results, albeit under different experimental conditions. The exposure to cell byproducts and waste described in the latter paragraph has also been discussed to moderate growth during the exponential phase for E. coli 4157 [20,34,50]. This model suggests that nonmotile cells may experience a decrease in exponential growth because of an altered metabolism due to a lack of sedimentation. The results of cultures grown under simulated microgravity do not support this theory, as the nonmotile E.coli 4157 strain experienced a slightly higher exponential growth rate in simulated microgravity than the 1 g control. Meanwhile, the sedimentation that occurred in simulated lunar gravity was potentially sufficient to allow cells to ‘escape’ byproducts and have access to more nutrients, thus yielding the highest observed growth rate when compared to the 1 g control for this strain. In our study, the three strains reached the stationary phase by 12 h. The AMG1 and 4157 strains showed no significant differences in OD as a function of gravitational condition at this time. On the other hand, the ∆rpoS strain had the highest OD under simulated microgravity (35% increase with respect to 1 g), the lowest at 1 g, and sLg and sMg in between. At experiment end (t = 24 h), the highest growth was observed under simulated microgravity on the AMG1 strain (48% increase with respect to 1 g) (with simulated lunar and Martian gravities in between), and under simulated micro and Lunar gravities on the ∆rpoS strain (44% increase with respect to 1 g) (with simulated Martian gravity in between). The 4157 strain showed the opposite: the highest growth was at 1 g, and the lowest under simulated microgravity (17% decrease with respect to 1 g). In this case, and keeping in mind the caveat regarding different media used for 4157, a correlation was observed that the non-motile strain had less growth in simulated microgravity and most in 1 g, while the opposite was true for the semi-motile and motile strains. The observed higher yield in simulated microgravity with respect to 1 g of the 4157 strain also contradicts observations made on the same flight hardware (albeit in minimal media) in actual microgravity, where a 13 fold increase was observed in the spaceflight samples with respect to Earth controls [7]. If the increase in growth under simulated micro- and lunar gravities of the uropathogenic strains (AMG1 and AMG1 ∆rpoS) holds true in these environments, this may have a negative impact by increasing the likelihood of crewmembers developing UTIs, a problem frequently reported by astronauts [51]. Cellular size measurements, taken from samples fixed at experiment end (t = 24 h), showed that AMG1 cells grown under simulated microgravity were 17% longer and 11% wider with respect to 1 g controls. In the case of the ∆rpoS strain, the only difference in cell size observed was a 6% increase in length with respect to 1 g on the cells cultured under simulated Martian gravities. No statistical differences were observed on E.coli 4157 cell length or diameter as a function of gravitational condition. Our overall cell size observations are not in agreement with our previous spaceflight results, where E. coli 4157 cells cultured in space were 59% the length, and 83% the diameter, of their Earth controls [21]. In terms of aggregation, none was observed in the AMG1 and ∆rpoS strains, and it was present in 4157 cultures, but exclusively those cultured under simulated microgravity. This is in agreement with our previous 4157 study, where cellular aggregation was observed in spaceflight samples fixed in PFA upon return to Earth, while none was seen in the Earth controls [21]. Regarding the MICs, the uropathogenic AMG1 strain showed that lower concentrations of Ciprofloxacin, the most commonly used antibiotic against UTIs on Earth [43], were needed under the three simulated reduced gravities with respect to 1 g, despite the fact that these gravitational conditions yielded higher cell counts in the growth dynamics study. Significantly, it was observed that cultures grown in simulated lunar gravity needed twice the concentration of simulated micro and Martian gravities, but still less than 1 g. Similarly, the ∆rpoS strain needed a lower concentration of antibiotics to inhibit growth under simulated microgravity with respect to the other three gravitational conditions. Finally, for the 4157 strain, the simulated lunar gravity cultures required the highest concentration of Gentamicin for growth to be inhibited: 18 mg/L, compared to 12 mg/L needed for the other three gravitational conditions. Hence, this study showed differences in growth dynamics, cellular size, and aggregation as a function of time and E. coli strain under clinorotation, results that may be verified and further studied under axial centrifugation in microgravity, in order to more realistically achieve simulated lunar and Martian gravities. Nevertheless, our inclined clinostat and in-house code methodology may enable preliminary partial gravity studies to be performed on Earth by other teams, with the caveat that this methodology (just like all reduced gravity simulation devices including clinostats, rotating wall vessels, and random positioning machines) still need to go through a thorough verification and validation process using spaceflight assets.",

Copyright notice ID: 9502502 PMID: 36143436 Abstract Bacterial behavior has been studied under microgravity conditions, but very little is known about it under lunar and Martian gravitational regimes. An Earth-based approach was designed and implemented using inclined clinostats and an in-house-developed code to determine the optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures of 5 RPM. With this setup, growth dynamics, phenotypic changes, and sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for three Escherichia coli strains (including uropathogenic) were examined under simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. The results included increased growth under simulated micro- and lunar gravities for some strains, and higher concentrations of antibiotics needed under simulated lunar gravity with respect to simulated micro- and Martian gravities. Clinostat-produced results can be considered suggestive but not determinative of what might be expected in altered gravity, as there is still a need to systematically verify these simulation devices’ ability to accurately replicate phenomena observed in space. Nevertheless, this approach serves as a baseline to start interrogating key cellular and molecular aspects relevant to microbial processes on the lunar and Martian surfaces.

Introduction Humans carry roughly as many bacterial cells in and on our bodies as we have total mammalian cells [1]. By the nature of this, we will ubiquitously share space habitats with bacteria. Hence, it is important to understand how an altered gravitational environment may affect bacterial behavior and, in the context of human health concerns, the efficacy of antibiotics. Although no overarching definitive conclusions have yet been reached [2,3], many studies performed in space have shown altered bacterial behavior in microgravity with respect to 1 g on Earth [4], including modified cell and biofilm phenotype [5,6,7,8], increased virulence [9], and reduced bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics [7,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. While these studies have interrogated bacterial behavior and its potential consequences for crew health in the microgravity environment of orbital flight, very little is known on these topics under lunar and Martian gravitational regimes, 1.62 m/s2 (~⅙ g) and 3.72 m/s2 (~⅜ g), respectively. Of particular interest are processes related to urinary tract infections (UTI) given that urosepsis (which can occur if a UTI is not treated properly) is the third most likely reason for emergent medical evacuation from the International Space Station (ISS) [23]. Escherichia coli is the most commonly isolated UTI pathogen [24], and is also typically used as a bacterial model organism for spaceflight research [19]. As part of a NASA-funded study using ten microbes (results of other species to be published separately), this manuscript describes experiments focused on characterizing growth dynamics (lag phase duration, exponential growth rate, and final cell counts at stationary phase), phenotypic changes (cell diameter and length and aggregation), and the sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for three E. coli strains cultured under simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. Our methodology to simulate some aspects of these gravitational conditions—inclined clinostats and a code to determine an optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures—are also explained.2. Background Although some mechanistic observations have been made [19,20,22], it is not yet clearly elucidated how biophysical and molecular genetic phenomena—such as the activation of antibiotic resistant pathways—change within gravitational regimes between microgravity and 1 g, or how these environments impact bacterial phenotype, physiology, or behavior. To further interrogate the effects of reduced gravities, lunar and Martian gravitational regimes were simulated on Earth to the extent possible, using BioServe’s in-house developed clinostats. While rotating wall vessels and clinostats allows for the simulation of some aspects of the microgravity environment (also called ‘low-shear modeled microgravity’), the replication of regimes between microgravity and 1 g requires an additional step. Clinostats continuously rotate a container fully loaded with a liquid culture at a constant speed with the goal of maintaining cells within a determined depletion zone [25,26]. To ensure the rotation is not so fast that cells are centrifuged away from this zone, or too slow so that they would sediment out of suspension, a code was developed to determine the angular velocity to be used based on parameters such as cell length, diameter, mass, buoyancy-corrected mass, density, medium density and viscosity, and vessel diameter via a set of second order, linear, separable, non-homogeneous stiff differential equations [27]. These ‘FPA Clinostats’ could be set horizontally (to simulate microgravity), vertically (for 1 g controls), or at an angle in between to replicate certain aspects of regimes between micro- and 1 g (see Figure 1 and Figure 2) [28,29,30,31,32,33]. It is acknowledged that, just as clinostat-produced environments are not the same as actual microgravity (they cannot remove Earth’s gravity and can introduce confounding factors), inclined clinostats are not the same as the actual lunar or Martian surface. Nevertheless, they serve as a reasonable baseline to start interrogating key cellular and molecular aspects relevant to microbial processes on the lunar and Martian surfaces. Figure 1.

Shown here are cultures from a study reported separately using non-motile Salmonella are shown, as no images were taken of this particular study. Cellular sedimentation (indicated by cyan lines) can be observed being collinear to the axis of rotation, regardless of the angle of clinostat inclination.The E. coli strains chosen for this study were (i) ATCC® 4157™, previously flown by our group on eight space shuttle flights aboard STS-37, -43, -50, -54, -57, -60, -62, and -95 [28,34] and to the ISS [19], (ii) AMG1, a uropathogenic clinical isolate from the Stanford Medical Center [35], and (iii) an rpoS knockout mutant of AMG1 to study this regulator gene’s pathways (associated with resistance to multiple types of stresses and resistance to some antibiotics on Earth via its product, the σS sigma factor [36,37,38,39,40]. The latter two strains were flown to space on NASA’s EcAMSat [40,41,42]. The uropathogens were challenged with Ciprofloxacin, the most commonly prescribed drug for UTI [43]. ATCC® 4157™ was challenged with Gentamicin sulfate as in [19].3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Setup E. coli AMG1 and its mutant strain were cultured in modified artificial urine medium supplemented with glucose and a high concentration of phosphate (mAUMg hi-Pi) [5,44] to replicate human urine. While glucose concentrations in human urine are usually 0 to 0.8 mM or lower [45], our growth medium had a higher concentration, 2 mM, for comparison against our group’s other spaceflight studies (to be published separately) and to ensure bacterial growth would take place, enabling us to interrogate the role of simulated gravitational conditions. E. coli 4157 was cultured in LB lennox broth (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, L3022). All strains were grown at 37 °C. Cultures were housed in BioServe’s FPAs, enclosed by rubber septa, and then loaded into BioServe’s FPA clinostats (Figure 1). Washing, sigmacoting®, and sterilization was performed on all hardware prior to experimentation, per Zea et al. [20].3.2. Bacterial Motility To determine the motility of each strain, a needle dipped in bacterial culture was inserted into motility tubes (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. R061410) and was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. A motile culture was indicated by a dispersion of pink color resulting from the bacterial reduction of Tetrazolium (TTC), a metabolite within the agar (Figure 3). The motility tests showed that E. coli AMG1 was semi motile, E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS was motile, and E. coli ATCC 4157 was non-motile. Figure 3. Open in a new tab AMG1 was semi motile, AMG1 ∆rpoS was motile, and ATCC 4157 was non-motile.3.3. Experimental Approach A 24-h culture was diluted by 1:100 and loaded into the FPAs. The optical density (OD)595 at the start of the experiment was 0.002 on average. The FPA consisted of four independent chambers, each containing 1.3 mL of culture, segregated by rubber septa. One FPA was sacrificed at each timestamp for OD data acquisition (the last timestamp had eight replicates for improved statistics). Timestamps were determined by preliminary growth curve experiments conducted at 1 g, and in the case of the E. coli AMG1 and E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS strains, were based on the timeline presented in Pagden et al. [40]. Additional FPAs were loaded with 10 mL of culture each for supplemental analyses, including microscopy. For the antibiotic sensitivity experiments, each FPA had two independent chambers, each containing 3 mL of culture, and enough FPAs were loaded so that there were four replicates for each tested antibiotic concentration, per each gravitational condition. The desired antibiotic concentration was prepared with the same media used in the bacterial culture as diluent and was filter sterilized. In each test, four concentrations were assessed. Drugs (Ciprofloxacin (Fisher Sci., Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. AC456880050) or Gentamicin Sulfate (Fisher Sci., Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. BP918-1)) were introduced in the bacterial culture when they reached exponential phase. At this time, two FPAs per gravitational regime were sacrificed for OD data acquisition to quantify cell concentration at the time of antibiotic introduction. Then, the four antibiotic concentrations were introduced to their respective FPAs by injecting 1 mL of antibiotic into each chamber. All FPAs were returned to their FPA Clinostat and environmental test chamber at 37 °C for 12 additional hours, following the MIC protocol described by Andrews [46], adapted to be implementable in this spaceflight hardware. In this assay, bacterial cultures are challenged with increasing concentrations of antibiotics to find the minimum concentration of a given drug sufficient to inhibit bacterial growth under those conditions. Growth inhibition is determined by statistically comparing cell concentration after 12 h of drug challenge against the cell concentration at the time of antibiotic introduction.3.4. Code to Determine Clinostat Rotational Speed One of the unique attributes of microgravity at the cellular level in a liquid medium is an altered extracellular mass transport profile. On Earth, a cell in a liquid medium will be subject to gravity-driven forces and resultant flows, including sedimentation, buoyancy, and convection, which help transport molecules from one location to another. In microgravity, however, and for non-motile cells in particular, mass transport is limited to diffusion arising from Brownian motion, surface effects, and/or gradient-driven transport phenomena, translating into a quiescent, quasi-stable extracellular environment where incoming substrate is thought to become limited, and excreted metabolic byproducts accumulate around a cell [20,33]. Some aspects of this quiescent environment can be replicated using a clinostat on Earth to continuously rotate a vessel filled with a liquid culture, with the caveat that the 1 g vector is never removed as it is operated on Earth. Thus, the suspended cells still experience their full weight. The angular speed (ω) at which this vessel is rotated is a function of cellular and medium properties, including but not limited to cell length and diameter (normalized into an equivalent Stoke’s radius (a), mass (m), buoyancy-corrected mass (m*), particle density (ρp), medium density (ρf), viscosity (ν), and Stoke’s drag constant (f), as well as the vessel diameter (d). If the vessel is rotated too slowly, the cell will sediment away from the quiescent zone; if it is rotated too quickly, however, the cell will be centrifuged out of the quiescent zone. The position of a particle at a given time (t) can be modeled based on the aforementioned parameters via two second order, linear, separable, non-homogenous stiff differential equations [25,27,47]: x¨+fmx˙−m*mω2x=−m*gmsinωt (1) y¨+fmy˙−m*mω2y=−m*gmcosωt (2) where x and y refer to the axes of a coordinate system upon which the vessel’s circular cross section is centered at the (0,0) position. We developed a MATLAB® code based on the ode15 s ordinary differential equation solver [27], to determine the longest duration a cell would stay within the putative quiescent zone under these conditions as a function of angular speed (accessible here: https://github.com/SpaceLuisZea/Clinostat) (accessed on 9 August 2022). As inputs to the code, we used a bacterial Stoke’s diameter of 5.6×10−5 cm, cell mass of 4.0×10−13 g, growth medium viscosity of 0.0102 g/cm·s and density of 1.011 g/cm3 (for reference, water’s viscosity at 25 °C and density are 0.0091 g/cm·s and 1.000 g/cm3, respectively), and an arbitrary quiescent zone diameter of 10 µm. This information (as well as recommended rotational speed) has been shared with other groups who have used our clinostats and FPAs [48].3.5. Data Acquisition Cultures were extracted and transferred into a 24-well plate for mixing, and from there aliquots were transferred to a 96-well plate. OD was measured at 595 nm for the growth curve and at 600 nm for MIC experiments. Cultures from the last timestamp of the growth curve for each regime were preserved by mixing 1 mL of 4% PFA (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. AAJ61899AK) and 1 mL of sample. For microscopy, samples were centrifuged for two to three minutes at 900 g’s and an aliquot was transferred to a slide. Microscopy was performed on an OLYMPUS.IX81 Inverted Widefield Microscope with a 100X 1.40NA SAPO objective lens and images were captured via a Hamamatsu Orca R2 CCD camera.3.6. Statistical Analysis At each timestamp and for each gravitational regime, four replicates were sacrificed to acquire OD data. For each replicate, four aliquots were assessed, hence the OD for each regime at each timestamp was the mean of the averages of four aliquots per each of the four replicates. To determine if there were statistical differences between the gravitational regimes at 24 h, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for parametric datasets or Dunn test for nonparametric data sets was performed. Slopes between the beginning and end of the exponential phase were found using Microsoft Excel’s “slope” function. These slopes were compared to the 1 g control (slopegravitational regime/slope1 g). R2 values were found by using Excel’s RSQ function. This same process was used to calculate the “death rate” via the slope between the stationary phase and the last timepoint in the experiment. The average length and width were calculated for 50 measurements of each condition, preserved at the last timestamp. For MIC tests, a Tukey, Kruskal, or Dunn test was performed between OD at the time of antibiotic introduction and after 12 h of being challenged with antibiotics. The lowest concentration for which there was no significance with respect to the OD at time of drug introduction was the MIC.4. Results 4.1. Calculated Time to Depart a Putative 10 µm Depletion Zone We used our MATLAB® code to simulate and subsequently determine how long it would take a non-motile bacterial cell to leave a depletion zone of 10 µm in diameter as a function of rotational speed and vessel diameter. Figure 4 shows the code output in this regard, indicating that for an FPA-like vessel (1 cm in diameter) and 5 RPM rotational speed, a non-motile bacterial cell could be expected to remain within this depletion zone (i.e., it would not sediment or be centrifuged away from it) for ~220 h, or just over nine days. Given that this was longer than our expected two-day long test, this RPM was chosen. Figure 4.

AMG1 and ∆rpoS Results 4.2.1. Growth Dynamics Figure 5 shows the growth dynamics of E. coli AMG1 and E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS under various simulated gravities. Limited by the times of data collection, the OD data indicate that the lag phase lasted to at least 1.25 h and 1 h for E. coli AMG1 and AMG1 ∆rpoS, respectively. The beginning and end of the exponential growth phase were 1.25 and 4.5 h for E. coli AMG1, and 3 and 5 h for AMG1 ∆rpoS, respectively. Slopes between these points are summarized in Table 1.

At the 6 h timepoint, significance was only observed between simulated microgravity and the 1 g control (13% increase under simulated microgravity with respect to 1 g, p = 0.036). To maintain consistency between the strains, statistical analysis was performed at the 12 h timepoint as well. No significant differences were observed between any regimes for E. coli AMG1. For E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS, cultures grown under simulated lunar gravity and at 1 g reached the stationary phase at 6 h. Under simulated micro and Martian gravities, growth continued until at least 11.25 h. Statistical analysis was performed on data from 11.25 h and significant increases in OD were observed in simulated microgravity with respect to the other three gravitational conditions: simulated lunar (8% increase, p = 0.0099), simulated Martian gravity (15% increase, p < 0.001), and 1 g (35% increase, p < 0.001). When compared to the 1 g control, simulated lunar gravity exhibited significant differences (25% increase, p < 0.001), but not when compared to simulated Martian gravity. Finally, simulated Martian gravity exhibited significant differences when compared to the 1 g control (17% increase, p < 0.001). Comparison of OD between the strains under each gravitational condition shows significance only for the simulated microgravity regime (34% increase of AMG1 ∆rpoS with respect to AMG1, p = 0.003) (orange line in Figure 6).

Similarly, simulated lunar and Martian gravity showed significant increases when compared to the 1 g control (36% increase, p = 0.0037; 33% increase, p = 0.0132, respectively). No significance was observed when comparing simulated lunar to simulated Martian gravity. For the mutant strain, while no significant differences in OD were observed between the three reduced gravitational conditions at 24 h, each of them did show statistical differences with respect to the 1 g control. Simulated microgravity had a 44% increase (p < 0.001), simulated lunar gravity also had a 44% increase (p < 0.001), and simulated Martian gravity had a 31% increase (p < 0.001). Comparison between strains under each gravitational condition showed significantly higher ODs for the mutant with respect to AMG1 under simulated lunar (23% increase, p = 0.003) and under simulated Martian gravities (12% increase, p = 0.045) (orange lines in Figure 7).

Table 3 indicates average cell length and width for each gravitational regime and strain, and how each compares to the 1 g controls. The simulated microgravity regime for the wild-type had the biggest size difference for both length (17% greater) and width (11% greater) compared to the 1 g control. The Dunn test was used to identify statistically significant differences in cell length and width as a function of gravitational regime and strain. Table 3.

MIC of Ciprofloxacin E. coli AMG1 and E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS were challenged, separately, with increasing concentrations of Ciprofloxacin (0, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.50 mg/L) to determine the minimum concentration of antibiotic needed to inhibit their growth under each gravitational condition. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic under which no statistical difference in OD600 (via Kruskal and Dunn tests) was observed between the time of drug introduction and 12 h later. As summarized in Table 4, lower concentrations of Ciprofloxacin were needed to inhibit E. coli AMG1 growth under the simulated reduced gravities with respect to the 1 g control, which continued growing under the highest concentration tested. It is noteworthy that the simulated microgravity and simulated Martian gravity conditions required half of what was needed under simulated lunar gravity to inhibit E. coli AMG1′s growth. Similarly, E. coli AMG1 ∆rpoS growth was inhibited under simulated microgravity at a 0.50 mg/L concentration—a concentration that was not inhibitory under the other four tested gravitational conditions. Table 4.

Growth Dynamics E. coli 4157 was cultured over the course of 24 h as shown in Figure 8. The data indicated that the lag phase lasted 0.75 h for all simulated gravities. Exponential growth slopes were calculated between t = 1.5 and 6 h, and were compared to the 1 g control, as summarized in Table 5. The rate of growth during the exponential phase for each regime showed faster growth under the simulated reduced gravities with respect to 1 g, with no specific pattern: simulated lunar gravity had the highest growth rate, 14% greater than the 1 g control, followed by simulated Martian and microgravity (8 and 5% greater than the 1 g control, respectively).

MIC of Gentamicin Sulfate E. coli 4157 was challenged with increasing concentrations (0, 6, 12, 18 mg/L) of Gentamicin Sulfate to determine the MIC. Simulated microgravity, simulated Martian gravity, and the 1 g controls required a 12 mg/L concentration of Gentamicin Sulfate to inhibit E. coli 4157 growth.

Discussion A clinostat may replicate certain aspects of the quiescent extracellular environment experienced in actual microgravity, but it is not the same as microgravity, as it operates on Earth, and thus weightlessness is not achieved. Furthermore, there are key aspects that need to be taken into account when designing reduced gravity experiments on Earth using simulation devices such as clinostats and rotating wall vessels. Namely, the importance of (i) the appropriate angular speed to minimize centrifugation and sedimentation of cells out of their proposed extracellular depletion zone, and of (ii) the use of the smallest diameter vessel possible. Our code indicated that clinorotating a 1 cm diameter vessel at 5 RPM would allow for bacteria to stay within a 10 µm depletion zone for about a week, more than sufficient for our two-day experiment. Given that centrifugal forces are dependent upon the distance between a cell and the axis of rotation, there is an advantage to having the smallest diameter culture vessel as possible, as a cell farther away from this axis will be centrifuged away from its depletion zone faster, hence limiting the duration of the clinostat experiment. In terms of the inclination of clinostats to simulate some aspects of gravity levels between micro and 1 g, the collinearity between cellular sedimentation and the axis of rotation, regardless of the angle of inclination, is a visual indication that this approach achieves the goal of effective axial g-vector alignment (see Figure 2). While our code has its limitations, namely that it does not include Brownian motion or cellular motility when applicable, nor does it take into account cellular aggregation, which is initially unknown, it serves as a first-order analysis to determine the best angular speed based on cellular and media parameters. We recommend that future iterations of this code—which is accessible here: https://github.com/SpaceLuisZea/Clinostat (accessed on 9 August 2022)—include Brownian motion, and that Monte Carlo simulations be run to obtain further numerical results. More importantly, it is acknowledged that a systematic verification of the validity of clinostats (and rotating wall vessels like HARV, and of random positioning machines, for that matter) needs to be performed by either including clinostat sets in spaceflight experiments, or flying experiments with clinorotated Earth controls (varying angular velocity, for example) with this very specific goal. Otherwise, simulated reduced gravity research performed in any of these types of simulation devices needs to be considered exploratory in nature and remains suggestive of what may be expected in microgravity, not determinative or conclusive in this regard, which also applies to this study. The growth dynamics results of our experiments indicate there is a direct correlation between motility and lag phase duration: the non-motile strain (4157) took less time to leave the lag phase (0.75 h), the semi motile strain (AMG1) took 1 h, and the motile strain (∆rpoS) took the longest (1.25 h). This correlation supports the theory that non-motile cells, in a quiescent extracellular environment like the one experienced in microgravity, are exposed to a relatively high concentration of their own byproducts and secondary metabolites [19,20,22], which may include quorum sensing molecules instructing the culture to begin exponential growth [4]. Comparing these results with those from spaceflight show that our observed reduced lag phase of E. coli 4157 matches our previous studies performed on the Space Shuttle [11,34,49]. This correlation may also be non-conclusively interpreted as an indication that the use of clinostats (specifically at 5 RPM and 1 cm diameter vessel), may indeed replicate certain aspects of microbial response in true microgravity. An important caveat to this comparative analysis is that the AMG1 and ∆rpoS strains were cultured in minimal media, whereas 4157 was in rich medium. Analyses of exponential growth rates showed that the AMG1 and ∆rpoS strains grew faster under simulated microgravity (17–23% increase with respect to 1 g); simulated lunar and Martian gravities either grew just as fast as simulated microgravity, or somewhere in between simulated microgravity and 1 g. The 4157 strain also showed a faster growth rate under the simulated reduced gravities with respect to 1 g, but in this case, simulated lunar gravity was the fastest growing (14% with respect to 1 g). Comparing these results with spaceflight data shows that these increases in exponential growth rate do not agree with the EcAMSat spaceflight mission, which found that the growth rate of AMG1 and ∆rpoS strains was unaltered by the microgravity environment [40], although it should be noted that it was acknowledged that their cells may have been under stress from the culturing hardware, and that different media were used in the two experiments. Similarly, Klaus et al. [34] found that the rate of growth for cells grown in microgravity was ‘unaffected (or slightly slower)’, again contrary to our results, albeit under different experimental conditions. The exposure to cell byproducts and waste described in the latter paragraph has also been discussed to moderate growth during the exponential phase for E. coli 4157 [20,34,50]. This model suggests that nonmotile cells may experience a decrease in exponential growth because of an altered metabolism due to a lack of sedimentation. The results of cultures grown under simulated microgravity do not support this theory, as the nonmotile E.coli 4157 strain experienced a slightly higher exponential growth rate in simulated microgravity than the 1 g control. Meanwhile, the sedimentation that occurred in simulated lunar gravity was potentially sufficient to allow cells to ‘escape’ byproducts and have access to more nutrients, thus yielding the highest observed growth rate when compared to the 1 g control for this strain. In our study, the three strains reached the stationary phase by 12 h. The AMG1 and 4157 strains showed no significant differences in OD as a function of gravitational condition at this time. On the other hand, the ∆rpoS strain had the highest OD under simulated microgravity (35% increase with respect to 1 g), the lowest at 1 g, and sLg and sMg in between. At experiment end (t = 24 h), the highest growth was observed under simulated microgravity on the AMG1 strain (48% increase with respect to 1 g) (with simulated lunar and Martian gravities in between), and under simulated micro and Lunar gravities on the ∆rpoS strain (44% increase with respect to 1 g) (with simulated Martian gravity in between). The 4157 strain showed the opposite: the highest growth was at 1 g, and the lowest under simulated microgravity (17% decrease with respect to 1 g). In this case, and keeping in mind the caveat regarding different media used for 4157, a correlation was observed that the non-motile strain had less growth in simulated microgravity and most in 1 g, while the opposite was true for the semi-motile and motile strains. The observed higher yield in simulated microgravity with respect to 1 g of the 4157 strain also contradicts observations made on the same flight hardware (albeit in minimal media) in actual microgravity, where a 13 fold increase was observed in the spaceflight samples with respect to Earth controls [7]. If the increase in growth under simulated micro- and lunar gravities of the uropathogenic strains (AMG1 and AMG1 ∆rpoS) holds true in these environments, this may have a negative impact by increasing the likelihood of crewmembers developing UTIs, a problem frequently reported by astronauts [51]. Cellular size measurements, taken from samples fixed at experiment end (t = 24 h), showed that AMG1 cells grown under simulated microgravity were 17% longer and 11% wider with respect to 1 g controls. In the case of the ∆rpoS strain, the only difference in cell size observed was a 6% increase in length with respect to 1 g on the cells cultured under simulated Martian gravities. No statistical differences were observed on E.coli 4157 cell length or diameter as a function of gravitational condition. Our overall cell size observations are not in agreement with our previous spaceflight results, where E. coli 4157 cells cultured in space were 59% the length, and 83% the diameter, of their Earth controls [21]. In terms of aggregation, none was observed in the AMG1 and ∆rpoS strains, and it was present in 4157 cultures, but exclusively those cultured under simulated microgravity. This is in agreement with our previous 4157 study, where cellular aggregation was observed in spaceflight samples fixed in PFA upon return to Earth, while none was seen in the Earth controls [21]. Regarding the MICs, the uropathogenic AMG1 strain showed that lower concentrations of Ciprofloxacin, the most commonly used antibiotic against UTIs on Earth [43], were needed under the three simulated reduced gravities with respect to 1 g, despite the fact that these gravitational conditions yielded higher cell counts in the growth dynamics study. Significantly, it was observed that cultures grown in simulated lunar gravity needed twice the concentration of simulated micro and Martian gravities, but still less than 1 g. Similarly, the ∆rpoS strain needed a lower concentration of antibiotics to inhibit growth under simulated microgravity with respect to the other three gravitational conditions. Finally, for the 4157 strain, the simulated lunar gravity cultures required the highest concentration of Gentamicin for growth to be inhibited: 18 mg/L, compared to 12 mg/L needed for the other three gravitational conditions. Hence, this study showed differences in growth dynamics, cellular size, and aggregation as a function of time and E. coli strain under clinorotation, results that may be verified and further studied under axial centrifugation in microgravity, in order to more realistically achieve simulated lunar and Martian gravities. Nevertheless, our inclined clinostat and in-house code methodology may enable preliminary partial gravity studies to be performed on Earth by other teams, with the caveat that this methodology (just like all reduced gravity simulation devices including clinostats, rotating wall vessels, and random positioning machines) still need to go through a thorough verification and validation process using spaceflight assets.Acknowledgments The authors thank BioServe’s Pamela Flores for her support setting up experiments and guidance through her extensive biology and statistics knowledge, Paul Koenig for the development and maturation of the FPA Clinostats, Fredy España for his valuable work on the FPA Clinostats prototype during his internship at BioServe, Katherinne Herrera for cellular and media parameters information, and James Orth for his guidance on microscopy.

    "abstract": "Abstract The undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial biofilms in spacecraft poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to astronauts’ health. To mitigate the risks that arise from them, it is important to understand biofilms’ behavior in microgravity. As part of the Space Biofilms project, biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in spaceflight over material surfaces. Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use. Transcriptomic profiles for the different conditions are presented, and potential mechanisms of biofilm reduction on LIS are discussed. Subject terms: Microbiology, Molecular biology, Aerospace engineering",
    "introduction": "Introduction In previous and current spaces stations (Salyut-6 and -7, Mir, and the International Space Station (ISS)), damage caused by bacterial biofilms on hardware have resulted in function disruption and failures of myriad equipment (summarized in Zea et al., 2018, 20201,2). On the ISS, biofilms are a concern for the water recovery system, particularly for the water processing assembly’s wastewater tank and its downstream filter3,4, as well as for the hoses linking the distillation assembly to the purge and fluid pumps, which have needed to be returned to Earth for unclogging and reprocessing before sent back to ISS (Y.A. Velez-Justiniano, personal communication, June 10, 2022). Biofilms are communities of microbes attached to each other and to surfaces which can cause damage to materials either directly by using it as food, or indirectly via their metabolic byproducts5,6. While pre-planned biofilms may enable useful processes in space7–9, uncontrolled growth—especially of opportunistic or pathogenic microbes—may have another deleterious effect for space missions: increased risk of infections to the crew. Microbial communities living as biofilms can have increased tolerance to disinfectants and antibiotics10, which may contribute to recurrent infections. On Earth, biofilms are associated with 65% and 80% of infectious and chronic diseases, respectively11. Materials can profoundly influence biofilm growth, and it is possible to design surfaces that either prevent microbial adhesion or that have antimicrobial properties. Antimicrobial surfaces include those with metallic nanoparticles with biocidal effects12 and strongly oxidizing materials that destroy cell membranes13. However, biocidal surfaces have a critical failure mechanism when a layer of destroyed cells forms on the initial surface. This layer can provide a safe harbor for new microbes to colonize. Preventing initial adhesion of microbes via engineering of surface properties addresses this limitation. Surface roughness provides initial colonizers with favorable positions to adhere to a surface, and therefore smooth surfaces tend to be more successful at preventing adhesion14. Hydrophobicity is another property that is particularly focused on in the context of creating adhesion-free surfaces; however, the influence is a complicated one. In general, hydrophobic surfaces may cause greater initial attachment due to hydrophobic interactions between the surface and the cell membranes, but also allow larger detachment rates14. The fast pace of microbial adaptation and changes in gene expression also presents a significant challenge for creation of anti-biofouling materials. Microorganism behavior is significantly altered by the presence of different surfaces. For example, biofilm morphologies differ strongly across steel and polypropylene surfaces15, and gene expression is altered for microbes exposed to less habitable surfaces16,17. Therefore, even surfaces engineered to resist biofilms may not be immune to bacteria colonization. Biofilm growth in space stations and surface habitat components can decrease the probability of mission success and increase that of medical risks to the crew. Crewed missions to the Lunar surface and Mars, the latter requiring several years in space, warrant understanding of how biofilms grow differently in microgravity, as system functionality is of even higher importance when receiving spare parts from Earth or returning crew to Earth promptly is not possible. To address this, the NASA-funded Space Biofilms project was designed as described in Zea et al. 20181, and prepared and performed on board the ISS as reported in Flores et al., 202218. In brief, samples of Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 (PA14) were sent to the ISS and biofilms were allowed to grow on different surfaces for either one, two, or three days at 37 °C. Equivalent biofilms grown on Earth at 1 g were used as controls. The six material surfaces tested were stainless steel 316 (SS316), passivated SS316 (pSS316), a silicon wafer impregnated with silicone oil as a lubricant-impregnated surface (LIS)19, cellulose membrane, silicone, and silicone with a microtopography. Each condition tested had four replicates fixed in 4% PFA for morphology analysis, and other four preserved in RNAlater for gene expression analysis. Here, we report the morphological and transcriptomic results of SS316, pSS316, and LIS grown in nutrient-rich medium (to replicate wastewater); the rest are reported elsewhere20. SS316 and pSS316 were assessed given their common use for spacecraft components and for elements of the Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), respectively. LIS was tested as a potential alternative for future spacecraft parts most susceptible to biofilm formation. SS316 is an iron alloy containing chromium, nickel, and molybdenum characteristic for its increased resistance to corrosion compared to iron21. The passivation of SS316 uses a nitric or citric acid treatment to eliminate iron from the surface and generate an oxide passive layer to prevent corrosion22. LISs are a class of textured surfaces that are stably impregnated with a lubricant (e.g., oils) to render the surface with super-slippery properties19,23 (Fig. 1). The lubricant is held within the texture by capillary and intermolecular forces. A drop on LIS can exist in one of twelve different thermodynamic states depending on the properties of the solid texture, lubricant, droplet, and environment. Stable impregnation of the lubricant requires the contact angle of the lubricant on solid surface to be below a critical value set by the texture parameters. For the case of stable LIS, the texture tops can remain exposed or covered by a thin van der Waals lubricant film depending on the spreading coefficient of the lubricant on the solid surface (in the presence of droplet phase). A detailed discussion of the thermodynamic states, stable impregnation criteria, and droplet mobility are provided in Smith et al. (2013)19. Because a significant portion of the surface texture can stay submerged in the lubricant (except for texture tops) for stable LIS, these surfaces can achieve significant reduction in adhesion and have been shown to have remarkable antifouling properties24–30.

    "methods": "Methods Reagents and hardware The reagents and hardware were prepared as described in Flores et al. (2022)18. In brief, the PBS was prepared with PBS pellets (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. P4417) and autoclaved. The 1X LBK medium was LB Lennox (Sigma, Cat. L3022) supplemented with 0.86% potassium nitrate (Sigma, Cat. P8291) and filter sterilized with 0.22 µm filters (Nalgene, Cat. 566-0020). LBK medium was prepared at 1.18X concentration to load in the hardware to account for dilution during experiment activation. The 11.4% PFA solution was prepared by diluting 16% PFA (Alfa Aesar, Cat. 43368) with PBS. When mixed with the sample it yields a final concentration of 4% PFA. The RNAlater (Invitrogen, Cat. AM7021) was refrigerated prior to loading it in the hardware to induce the formation of RNAlater crystals. These crystals were then pulverized and the RNAlater was loaded cold into the hardware. Preemptive formation and pulverization of the RNAlater crystals avoided the formation of long crystals during launch (4 °C) that could cause sample loss, early activation, and leaks by displacing the hardware chambers. After sample incubation, the RNAlater was still efficient at preserving RNA from biofilms18. BioServe’s FPA housed in the Group Activation Pack (GAP) were used as both ground and flight sample hardware. The FPA hardware components were cleaned with 1% Liquinox (Alconox, Cat. 1201-1), coated with sigmacote (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. SL2), and dried at 100 °C for 30 min to siliconize the glass and facilitate sample assembly. Bacterial strain and Inoculum All the biofilm experiments were performed using Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 strain, which was kindly provided by Dr. George O’Toole. This strain was selected for the project to replicate the column-and-canopy biofilm structure previously observed in microgravity by Kim et al. (2013)31 when growing PA14 biofilms over cellulose membrane. The results of the biofilms grown over cellulose membrane are reported in a separate publication20. The bacterial inoculum was prepared with 6 ml of LBK media inoculated with PA14 and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h (final OD595 0.706). The overnight inoculum was diluted 1:100 with PBS (final OD595 0.001) to maintain cells in stasis. The diluted inoculum was used to load the second chamber of FPAs. Test surface preparation Biofilms were grown on 1 cm2 material coupons of SS316 (MPPR-311-6), pSS316, and LIS. SS316 coupons were cleaned with 1% Liquinox (Alconox Cat. 1201-1). For the pSS316, clean SS316 coupons were passivated with citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. C-8385). Preparation of LIS coupons (silicon wafer impregnated with silicone oil) has been described in detail previously1,18,19. LIS coupons were not cleaned, to avoid removing the silicone oil, but they were prepared in sterile conditions. LIS’s silicone oil layer (0.5–1.5 µm in thickness) has no bactericidal nor growth boost effect on P. aeruginosa PA1418. Sample preparation A total of 144 samples were prepared, 72 for flight and 72 for corresponding ground controls. All coupons were prepared in the same fashion. Each gravitational condition tested three material surfaces (SS316, pSS316, and LIS), three biofilm incubation times (1, 2, or 3 days), and two termination reagents (PFA for morphology analysis and RNAlater for transcriptomics) with four replicates per condition. Flight samples were sent to the ISS on the Cygnus NG-12 spacecraft. Double-sided tape (3 M, Cat. 9731) was placed on the backside of the coupons to adhere them onto the inserts. Adhered coupons on inserts were installed in the FPAs and autoclaved. FPAs were loaded with 2.75 ml of sterile 1.18X LBK and the first chamber was closed with a second insert. The use of solid inserts prevents gas exchange and forces anaerobic growth of P. aeruginosa. The first chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h as a contamination check. Afterward, the second chamber was loaded with 0.5 ml of the PA14 inoculum in stasis and closed with a rubber septum. The third and last chamber was filled with 1.75 ml of PFA or RNAlater and closed with a rubber septum. Eight FPAs with the three-chamber configuration were assembled into each GAP and transferred to 4 °C. Biofilm formation assays Spaceflight samples were launched in stasis (in PBS and at 4 °C) to the ISS to avoid bacterial growth before microgravity conditions were achieved. Once in microgravity, astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch activated the spaceflight samples by combining the first and second chambers of the FPAs, which introduced the inoculum into the culture media. Samples were incubated at 37 °C inside BioServe’s Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) for the designated incubation times (1, 2, or 3 days) in anaerobic conditions. At the end of incubation, the third chamber was introduced to fix (PFA) or preserve (RNAlater) the samples in microgravity, and samples were transferred to 4 °C or −80 °C, respectively, until unberthing. Fixed and preserved samples then returned to Earth at 4 °C and −20 °C, respectively. Once on Earth, samples were stored at 4 °C (fixed) and −80 °C (preserved) until sample processing. Ground samples were performed asynchronously, activating and terminating two hours later to replicate the order of flight procedures. The temperature profile of spaceflight samples was also reproduced for the ground samples. When spaceflight samples returned to Earth, all coupons (both flight and ground) were recovered from the FPAs and processed for morphology analysis (PFA) or transcriptomic analysis (RNAlater). Planktonic cell analysis Despite biofilms being the focus of our experiment, the planktonic cell culture of the samples was visually inspected with the naked eye for notorious changes between samples. In addition, the liquid cultures’ optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured. Samples were vortexed prior to measuring the OD600 to avoid cell clumping. Due to spaceflight constraints and the interest of fixing the samples while in microgravity, it was not possible to measure CFU/mL at experiment’s end. However, for P. aeruginosa PA14 in our experimental configuration, the OD600 measurements allow correct distinction of the bacterial stages of growth and are correlated to the viable cell density (Supplementary Figures 3 and 4). Biofilm morphology analysis To eliminate the planktonic cells, the coupons fixed in PFA were washed three times with 1 mL of PBS which was slowly poured on the walls of the wells to avoid disturbing the biofilm. The samples were stained with PI [15 µM] (PromoKine Cat. PK-CA707-40017 diluted with water) for 15 min and with FilmTracer™ FM™ 1-43 Green Biofilm [10 µg/ml] (Invitrogen Cat. F10317 diluted with DMSO and water as per manufacturer’s instructions) for 30 min under light-protected conditions. After each stain the samples were washed with 1 ml of PBS. Immediately after the wash, the PBS was removed and the stained samples were mounted onto glass slides; gorilla glue was used to adhere the coupon to the slide and the biofilm on top was covered with one drop of VectaShield HardSet™ Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Cat. H-1400-10) and a coverslip. Mounted samples were stored at 4 °C for 20 h protected from light prior to imaging, this allowed the mounting medium and glue to harden in order to avoid smearing the biofilm while imaging. Samples were imaged in groups of 4 per session (spaceflight samples with their corresponding ground controls in the same session). The Nikon SIM/A1 Laser scanning Confocal Microscope (inverted) of CU Boulder Light Microcopy Core Facility was used to take four 125 × 125 µm Z-stacks (30–40 slices with step size ranging from 0.1–1.5 µm, average 0.5 µm) per coupon, aligning the four fields of view to the center of the coupon. The biofilms were imaged with 100X SR Apo immersion oil objective (NA = 1.49 WD = 120 µm), using lasers 488 nm (green, emission filter 500–550 nm) and 561 nm (red, emission filter 575–625 nm). All images were acquired with 1.2 pinhole, laser power range (green and red = 0.1 to 2.3), offset range (green = −48 to 4, and red = −45 to 6), and PMT HV range (green = 3.0 to 86, red = 2.0 to 82) using the NIS Elements software. Images were taken with laser powers that avoided photobleaching and HV sensitivity settings that maximized the dynamic range without saturation. Resulting biofilm images were pseudo-colored with red (PI, nucleic acids) and green (Green Biofilm, lipids) for display with a linear LUT covering the full range of the data. Raw image files were used for quantitative analysis. First, Image J was used to merge both fluorescent channels and convert files from nd2 to tiff format. Then, the “Slice Remover” plugin was used to eliminate the slices with no biofilm signal from each Z-stack. The “Convert to OME-Tiff” macro was used to generate compatible files for analysis with the publicly available COMSTAT2 software90–92. COMSTAT2 calculated biofilm mass (µm3/µm2), thickness (µm), and surface area coverage (%) of the biofilms with automatic thresholding. Biofilm transcriptomic analyses Samples preserved in RNAlater were thawed at room temperature and washed 3 times with 1 ml PBS to get rid of any planktonic cells. PBS was removed and 1 ml of fresh RNAlater was added. The samples were ultrasonicated for 15 min at 40 kHz, followed by 5 min of vortexing to detach biofilm bacterial cells from the surface materials. RNA extraction was performed by University of Colorado Boulder BioFrontiers Sequencing Core and the sequencing by the Anschutz Genomics Shared Resource. The RNAlater with the suspended biofilm cells was centrifuged, and the pellet was used to extract total RNA using the Quick-RNA Fungal/Bacterial microprep Kit (Zymo Research Cat. R2010). RIN values were measured for the RNA extracted (Supplementary Table 12) RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3 (Takara Cat. 634485) and paired-end sequencing was performed on Illumina NOVASeq 6000 with 40 million reads per sample (Additional Transcriptomic information presented in Supplementary Table 13). Transcriptomic analysis was performed on CU Boulder’s RMACC Summit supercomputing cluster. Raw sequencing files were checked for quality control using FastQC (version 0.11.9)93 and multiQC (version 1.0.dev0)94. Then Illumina adapter contamination was eliminated using Trimgalore (version 0.6.6) with cutadapt (version 2.6)95, after which quality control was performed again. Trimmed reads were mapped to PA14 rRNA sequences to remove the contamination, the resulting unmapped reads were then mapped to the Ensembl Bacteria reference genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 (accession number GCA_000014625), both mapping steps were performed using Bowtie2 (version 2.4.4)96. The mapping results were sorted, indexed, and converted from .sam files to .bam files using SAMtools (version 1.11)97. The reads per gene were counted with Feature Counts (Rsubread package version 2.8.2)98, and differential gene expression analyses were done in an R (version 4.1.1)99 with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0)100. Pathways enrichment analyses were performed online using ESKAPE Act PLUS101 and the whole list of DEG (including ≤2-fold change genes) per condition as input. Statistics Morphology data was tested for parametric assumption compliance using Shapiro Wilk and Levene’s tests. The data did not comply with all the assumptions, thus non-parametric tests were used for all statistical analyses. Biofilm biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage data was compared between groups using two-sided Kruskal Wallis and Dunn’s (with Bonferroni correction) tests to determine if differences observed were significant. Significant differences have the significance level specified in parenthesis or in the plot (minimum of p-value < 0.05), while the non-significant values correspond to p-value > 0.05. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 using p-value < 0.05 as significance threshold, except for comparison between SS316 and pSS316 which used p-adj ≤ 0.05. Pathways enrichment analysis was performed with ESKAPE Act PLUS using a binomial test (FDR-corrected) with α = 0.05.

    "results": "Results The biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage of biofilms formed on SS316 were not statistically different from those of biofilms grown on pSS316 (α = 0.05) at any incubation day (Supplementary Figure 1 and raw data in Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, no morphological differences were observed between biofilms formed on the two materials (Supplementary Figure 2) for either Earth-based or microgravity cultures. In addition, there were no differentially expressed genes (DEG) between SS316 and pSS316 biofilms in any conditions tested (α = 0.05) except for microgravity day 2 where pSS316 had 44 DEG (Supplementary Table 2). Based on this, SS316 and pSS316 were pooled into one “SS” data set which is hereon compared and contrasted to that of biofilms formed on LIS. Biofilm morphology and observations from the liquid cultures In 1 g, biofilms on SS grew throughout the surface with no marked boundaries, usually creating conglomerates that formed ‘mounts’ of biofilm with dispersed single cells in between (Fig. 2a). Conversely, the few biofilms grown on LIS were restricted to certain areas with sharp edges, had a more compact appearance, and looked thicker (not significant) than those grown on SS (Fig. 2b). In addition, the LIS surface showed individual cells or small multiple cell groups attached in random isolated areas and a thin layer of nucleic acids in the areas where there was no biofilm. Bacterial cells attached on LIS were often found growing in the perimeter or inside of a circle (as seen for 1-day-old biofilms on 1 g) as well as small, connected clusters. Overall, biofilms on LIS seemed to be restricted to grow in smaller areas than on SS. Fig. 2. P. aeruginosa biofilm morphology on SS and LIS in 1 g or microgravity. Open in a new tab Representative confocal microscopy images of 1-, 2-, and 3-day-old biofilms formed over SS and LIS. Nucleic acids were stained with PI (red) and lipids were stained with Green Biofilm (green). First row per material is a bottom slice image with side-view panels of a cross-section point in the biofilm (specific section marked by the orange lines). Second row per material is a volume view of the complete z-stack image. Images correspond to biofilms grown in 1 g over a SS and b LIS, or for biofilms grown in microgravity over c SS and d LIS. Negative controls of the material surfaces, stained with both PI and Green Biofilm stains, are presented in panel (e). Scale bars are 20 µm. Biofilms form without boundaries on SS while on LIS they have sharp edges. Biofilms had significantly reduced surface area coverage on LIS, especially in microgravity where biofilms were minimized and mostly present as small groups of cells. The thin layer of nucleic acids on LIS surface could be DNA, RNA, or both as PI does not differentiate between them.The morphology of biofilms formed on SS in space was similar to that of the Earth controls, in that the space samples also exhibited a lack of clear boundaries and biofilm ‘mounts’ were also observed, albeit with bigger gaps between them (Fig. 2c). Biofilms grown on LIS in microgravity did not form as many sharp, compact, and thick biofilms (only a few in smaller size) compared to those formed in 1 g (Fig. 2d). The thickness of these smaller biofilms decreased in time (p < 0.001). Most of the surface of LIS was covered with a thin layer of nucleic acids (red signal from the propidium iodide (PI) stain). The PI did not partition to LIS’s silicone oil in the absence of bacteria, nor did the Green Biofilm stain (green signal to label lipids) (Fig. 2e) confirming that the signal on the biofilm samples corresponds to adsorbed nucleic acids on LIS’s surface. The PA14 liquid cultures in which the coupons were submerged became more turbid (turbidity correlation with viable cell count available in Supplementary Figure 3) for the microgravity set than for the 1 g controls (not significant for SS day 1 and SS day 2). Specifically, for the samples cultured for three days, when OD600 in microgravity had an increase of 41.3% for SS (p = 2.9e−08) and 23.4% for LIS (p = 0.0204) (Supplementary Figure 4 and raw data in Supplementary Table 3). In addition, it is worth noting that the color of the liquid culture changed as well. In microgravity, the cultures were light green on day 1, light brown on day 2, and light pink on day 3, while the ground cultures remained clear for days 1 and 2 and then turned light yellow on day 3 (Supplementary Figure 5). The increased culture turbidity in microgravity could suggest more bacterial growth in general; however, microgravity biofilms exhibited the opposite trend. Biofilm biomass, thickness, and surface coverage PA14 biofilms formed in microgravity had significantly lower (p ≤ 0.05) biomass (Fig. 3), and thickness (Fig. 4) than those formed at 1 g. This is true for both SS and LIS, the only exception being for the biofilms formed on LIS at one day of incubation, which exhibited no difference between gravitational regimes. In the case of SS, by day 3 biofilms formed in microgravity had only 17.6% and 53.6% of the ground control biomass and thickness, respectively. The same phenomenon was observed on LIS, where biofilms formed in space had 8.7% and 21.3% of the ground control biomass and thickness. Furthermore, biofilms formed in space covered significantly less surface than their 1 g counterparts (31.4% and 33.0% of surface area for SS and LIS, respectively) (Fig. 5). The median values for the three parameters assessed are summarized in Table 1 and the raw data in Supplementary Table 4. Fig. 3. P. aeruginosa biofilm mass on SS and LIS in 1 g or microgravity.

The SS and LIS biofilms on 1 g appeared to grow in size with time, with the largest growth observed between day 1 and day 2 (Figs. 2a,b, 3, 4, 5). This trend also held true for SS in microgravity; although with a lower growth rate (Figs. 2c, 3, 4, 5). For biofilms on LIS in microgravity, there was little to no change in mass and surface area coverage as a function of time. Biofilms grown on SS were significantly different than biofilms grown on LIS in terms of mass and surface area coverage. On both Earth and in microgravity, at day 3, the median of biomass and surface area coverage in LIS was significantly lower (p ≤ 0.001) than in SS biofilms (Table 1). Gene expression of biofilms in microgravity vs biofilms on 1 g Bacteria adapt to their environment through gene expression modulation. The mechanisms used by bacteria to adapt to changes can be observed in their transcriptomic profile. The following paragraphs compare 3-day-old biofilms formed in microgravity against matched Earth controls (baseline) for either SS or LIS surfaces. When available, the PAO1 ortholog gene numbers are listed in the brackets at the first mention of the corresponding PA14 gene. For SS, biofilms showed five DEG in microgravity with a fold change ≥2 (Fig. 6a, b, raw data in Supplementary Table 5). Three had increased expression (rsmY [PA0527.1], rmf [PA3049], pchB [PA4230]), and the remaining two had decreased expression in microgravity (PA14_63220 [PA4782], PA14_21970 [PA3249]). A KEGG pathways enrichment analysis was performed to understand at a bigger scale the more subtle changes (including the <2-fold changes) caused by microgravity (Supplementary Figure 6). No significant enrichments were found with >2-fold, but it showed the “nitrogen metabolism” pathway enriched (Supplementary Figure 7) in the space samples (1.02-fold). In addition, analyses were focused on genes involved in P. aeruginosa virulence and antimicrobial resistance. Despite pchB (2.2-fold) being the only gene in the virulome differentially expressed >2-fold, the other five genes involved in pyochelin production also had significant increased expression in microgravity for biofilms grown over SS (Fig. 6c): pchI (1.4-fold) [PA4222], pchE (1.9-fold) [PA4226], pchD (1.5-fold) [PA4228], pchC (1.9-fold) [PA4229], and fptA (1.8-fold) [PA4221]. There was no significant effect >2-fold in the resistome. Fig. 6. Transcriptional differences between P. aeruginosa biofilms formed on SS in space with respect to Earth.

Sample F16.5 was not considered an outlier because the expression of the rest of the genes was similar to the other samples and no problems were found in the quality control steps. n = 7 biological replicates per gravitational condition.For LIS, biofilms in microgravity had only one DEG – PA14_08190 (−6.4-fold, raw data in Supplementary Table 6)—which codes for a hypothetical protein. This suggests that biofilms on Earth and in space formed over LIS have virtually the same transcriptome. Futures tests in microgravity should confirm if this holds true at the protein level and should consider studying the function of PA14_08190. Gene expression of biofilms on LIS vs biofilms on SS The following paragraphs describe the results of the gene expression analyses performed to compare 3-day-old biofilms grown on LIS with respect to 3-day-old biofilms grown on SS (baseline). The first paragraph focuses on results under Earth’s gravity and the second paragraph for results in microgravity. On Earth, biofilms grown on LIS had 310 DEG with a fold change ≥2 (Fig. 7a, b, raw data in Supplementary Table 7) when compared to SS biofilms. The top five DEG were PA14_09380 [PA4218], pchC, PA14_06170 [PA1911], PA14_52500 [PA0909], and pchE; all with increased expression on LIS. Gene PA14_52500 is annotated as coding for a hypothetical protein and had the highest fold change (3.9) of all. Some of the genes that code for alginate production had significantly increased expression on LIS (below 2-fold): mucB (1.2-fold) [PA0764], mucD (1.1-fold) [PA0766], algR (1.5-fold) [PA5261], mucE (1.9-fold) [PA4033], mucP (1.4-fold) [PA3649]. The pathways enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure 8) showed the “carbon metabolism” pathway as the most enriched on LIS (1.1-fold) (Supplementary Figure 9). On Earth, the virulome presented several genes of Hcp secretion island I (HSI-I), type three secretion systems (TTSS), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and pyocyanin with decreased expression in LIS with respect to SS (Fig. 7c). Conversely, almost all the genes involved in synthesis of pyochelin had increased expression on LIS (>2.5-fold): pchI (3.1-fold), pchH (2.6-fold) [PA4223], pchG (2.7-fold) [PA4224], pchF (3.1-fold) [PA4225], pchE (3.1-fold), pchD (2.5-fold), pchC (3.1-fold), pchB (3.2-fold), pchA (3.0-fold) [PA4231], fptA (2.6-fold). In the resistome, gene nouJ [PA2645] had 2.2-fold increased expression on LIS. In addition, genes involved in apoptosis were differentially expressed on LIS biofilms, rpoS [PA3622] had increased expression (2.4-fold) and the antitoxins higA [PA4674] and PA14_21720 [PA2489] had decreased expression (−1.4 and −2.4-fold, respectively).

Open in a new tab Transcriptomic data from 3-day-old biofilms. a Volcano plot and b MA plot of differential gene expression. c Heatmap of normalized counts for relevant genes involved in P. aeruginosa virulome, significant differentially expressed genes with fold change ≥2 in bold. For SS, n = 7 biological replicates. For LIS, n = 4 biological replicates.In microgravity, biofilms grown on LIS had 425 DEG with a fold change >2 (Fig. 8a, b, raw data in Supplementary Table 8) when compared to SS. The top five DEG were PA14_27520 (−5.5-fold) [PA2826], PA14_44920 (−3.1-fold) [PA1509], PA14_20060 (3.7-fold), PA14_51580 (−4.0-fold), and estA (3.1-fold) [PA5112]. Three of these top five DEG code for hypothetical proteins that have not been characterized. In microgravity, no pathways were significantly enriched or depleted for LIS vs SS. Interestingly, the observations made on the virulome when comparing LIS with SS on Earth, remain true for biofilms on LIS in microgravity: HSI-I, TTSS, LPS, and pyocyanin-synthesis associated genes had reduced expression while genes associated with pyochelin and rhamnolipids had increased expression (Fig. 8c) with respect to SS. There was no increased expression of alginate-associated genes on LIS in microgravity, which differs to what was seen on Earth. In microgravity, the resistome of biofilms on LIS had increased expression of mexT (2.3-fold) [PA2492] and galU (2.1-fold) [PA2023], and decreased expression of ampD (−3.1) [PA4522]. Finally, when comparing LIS with respect to SS, no significant differences in gene expression of rpoS or higA were observed in microgravity, but one putative toxin (PA14_28120 [PA2781]) presented a 1.4-fold increased expression. Shared DEG in both gravitational regimes of biofilms on LIS with respect to SS at day 3 presented in Supplementary Table 9. Fig. 8.

Gene expression of 3-day-old biofilms vs 1-day-old biofilms Changes in the transcriptome between 3- and 1-day-old biofilms provide insight into the biofilm formation process. The following paragraphs describe the results of the gene expression analyses performed to compare biofilms grown on SS for 3 days with respect to biofilms grown on SS for 1 day (baseline). The first paragraph focuses on results under Earth’s gravity and the second paragraph for results in microgravity. On Earth, 3-day-old biofilms exhibited 115 DEG with fold change >2 (Supplementary Figure 10a, 10b, raw data in Supplementary Table 10) with respect to 1-day-old biofilms. The top five DEG at day three had decreased expression (PA14_40310 [PA1869], trxB2 [PA0849], PA14_39700, PA14_10380 [PA4139], nirN [PA0509]). PA14_10380, the most differentially expressed (−5.2-fold), codes for a hypothetical protein. With respect to day one, day three had increased expression of several genes involved in production of Psl extracellular matrix polysaccharide, in particular pslO (3.1-fold) [PA2245]. The pathways enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure 11) showed several depleted pathways at day three; “sulfur relay system” was the most depleted (−2.0-fold) (Supplementary Figure 12), followed by “nitrogen metabolism” (−1.7-fold) (Supplementary Figure 13). In the virulome of day three (Supplementary Figure 10c) there was a reduction in expression of genes in the Las (lasA −2.2-fold [PA1871], lasB −2.3-fold [PA3724]) and Rhl systems (rhlA −2.3-fold [PA3479], rhlB −2.2-fold [PA3478]), and of gene algP/algR3 (−2.1-fold) involved in alginate synthesis. Regarding the resistome on Earth, day three presented decreased expression of genes that code for RND efflux pumps and outer membrane proteins: mexH (−2.1-fold) [PA4206], ompA (−2.6-fold) [PA3692], opmD (−2.3-fold) [PA4208]. In microgravity, 3-day-old biofilms showed 70 DEG with fold change ≥2 (Supplementary Figure S14a, S14b, raw data in Supplementary Table 11) with respect to 1-day-old biofilms. The top five DEG at day three correspond to: PA14_40310 (−2.6-fold), malQ (−3.1-fold) [PA2163], PA14_36650 (−3.7-fold) [PA2159], PA14_72370 (−5.1-fold) [PA5482] and pchF (3.2-fold). Again, the most differentially (under)expressed gene (PA14_72370) codes for a hypothetical protein. There was no systemic increased expression of extracellular matrix polysaccharides on day three in microgravity, but as on the ground, the gene trxB2 (−2.3-fold) and the cytochrome c gene cluster (including nirN −2.1-fold) had decreased expression. The pathways enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure 15) showed three depleted pathways at day three in microgravity; “Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism” is the most depleted (−2.0-fold) (Supplementary Figure 16). In the virulome (Supplementary Figure 14c), rhlA (−2.2-fold) was less expressed on day three (as seen on Earth) while all pyochelin-associated genes had increased expression (pchI 2.1-fold, pchH 2.4-fold, pchG 3.5-fold, pchF 3.2-fold, pchE 3.2-fold, pchR 1.3-fold [PA4227], pchD 2.6-fold, pchC 2.8-fold, pchB 3.3-fold, pchA 3.5-fold, fptA 2.5-fold). In the resistome, ompA (−2.4-fold) showed a reduced expression on day three in microgravity, as seen in the ground samples.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this experiment, biofilm shape and general structure appearance was not affected by gravitational regime. Contrary to what has been previously reported for anaerobic P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm growth in space31, we observed less robust biofilms in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage in microgravity with respect to 1 g. In microgravity, the increased expression of rmf, in charge of ribosomal hibernation32 during stationary phase33, could be indicative of a substrate-limited and byproduct-abundant extracellular environment for biofilms over SS, as the one theorized to occur in microgravity for non-motile planktonic cells34,35. Such an environment could be partially attributed to the increased planktonic cell growth in microgravity, increasing the accumulation of metabolic byproducts and depletion of nutrients, and potentially the cause of reduced biofilm formation. Proteomic analysis and functional analysis are needed to confirm these hypotheses. Starvation environmental conditions can trigger biofilm dispersal in P. aeruginosa36,37. However, the genes known to be involved in biofilm dispersion38—dipA [PA5017]39,40, rbdA [PA0861]41, nbdA [PA3311]42,43, gcbA [PA4843]44, and bdlA [PA1423]39—were not differentially expressed in microgravity. Thus, biofilm dispersal could be regulated by other gene(s) in microgravity. Potentially, the increased planktonic growth and decreased biofilm formation are not a consequence of biofilm dispersion. For SS, the most DEG in microgravity was rsmY. RsmY (small non-coding RNA) controls broad gene expression in P. aeruginosa through the sequestering of RsmA (gene repressor)45. RsmA targets the mRNAs of genes mvaT [PA4315], pchB, pchC, pchD, and pchE46 and, those genes demonstrated increased expression in microgravity. We hypothesize that RsmY could be regulating some of the biggest transcriptional changes observed in biofilms grown over SS in microgravity. It is worth nothing that DEG PA14_63220 and PA14_21970 code for a hypothetical protein and a transcriptional regulator, respectively, that have not yet been characterized and whose functions could shed light to the changes observed in microgravity. Moreover, this could be specific for biofilms growing on SS, only for biofilms past microcolony stages, or both, as biofilms on LIS did not have increased expression of rsmY in microgravity. Our results suggest potential increased virulence of PA14 3-day-old biofilms on SS in microgravity through increased expression of pyochelin. Pyochelin is secreted to chelate iron for bacterial use47 and the outer membrane receptor, FptA, internalizes it. In addition, pyochelin production in biofilms is characteristic of aggressive and chronic infections48,49. Proteomic tests should confirm these results at protein level and on different surfaces. The green, brown, and pink colors of the liquid culture in microgravity could be attributed to the production of pigmented virulence factors such as pyoverdine (green-brown to green-yellow), pyorubin (red), pyocyanin (deep blue), pyomelanin (black)50. It appears that P. aeruginosa had an increased production of pyoverdine in the first days which then transitioned to an increased production of pyorubin. Interestingly biofilms in microgravity had no increased expression of pyoverdine, so the green-brown color in the liquid culture could be attributed to a higher production of this virulence factor by the planktonic cells. On the other hand, the pink color, possibly reflecting the production of pyorubin, could not be assessed as the genes involved in pyorubin production have not been identified in PA14, to our knowledge. These hypotheses need to be confirmed with transcriptomics and proteomics analyses of the planktonic cultures in future experiments. Nevertheless, the potential increased production of pigmented virulence factors of P. aeruginosa PA14 planktonic cells in microgravity, when grown in nutrient-rich medium, may pose a health risk for infections in space. Remarkably, LIS’s biofilm inhibition on Earth, was even greater in microgravity. Not only were biomass and surface area minimized, but these parameters stayed almost constant in time for microgravity biofilms on LIS. Coupled with the significant biofilm thickness reduction in time in microgravity, contrary to the increasing thickness trend on Earth, LIS performance in space makes it suitable to reduce biofilm formation in spacecraft components. Previous studies with different LISs show that this type of surfaces greatly reduce the attachment of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including P. aeruginosa)25,51–55. The liquid-like properties of LISs are believed to be the essential for the bacterial attachment inhibition56. Interestingly, biofilm formation on LIS was observed only in areas without the nucleic acid layer. We hypothesize that the thin layer of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or both) contributes to attachment inhibition. Nucleic acids have a hydrophilic phosphate backbone (negatively charged), and hydrophobic nitrogen bases57–59. It is possible that the interface between liquid culture and oil layer provided an ideal zone for DNA/RNA interaction, leading to their immobilization on the surface. It is well-established that oil/water interfaces can capture protein and nucleic acids60; and in some cases, the surface forces are strong enough to denature proteins60–67. Characterization of the protein adsorption/denaturing process on oil-infused textured surfaces, as LIS, remains to be done68,69. Thus, we hypothesize that the oil/water interface forces could be enough to destabilize extracellular DNA (eDNA), inducing conformational changes that result in its unzipping to ssDNA70, and that the DNA-associated proteins can be denatured to expose the DNA charges. Such that the hydrophobic portions of DNA/RNA partition into the oil of the LIS, leaving the hydrophilic phosphate backbone facing toward the aqueous culture. The mechanism of nucleic acid adsorption onto LIS surface and the exact composition of this layer remains to be elucidated and more tests are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (negatively charged due to its LPS) could be repelled by the phosphates of the nucleic acid layer (Fig. 9). Recent studies show reduced attachment of P. aeruginosa on surfaces with covalently attached and adsorbed DNA71, and on surfaces with DNA-poly(ethyleneimine) multilayers72. Staphylococcus was also repelled by multilayer chitosan-DNA coatings73. This hypothesis implies that DNA/RNA was released by the planktonic cells and attached to LIS early in the experiment. On LIS, biofilm’s reduced expression of LPS-related genes (on Earth and in microgravity) and increased expression of alginate (only on Earth)—a secreted polyanionic polysaccharide that helps mask LPS’s charge—could be related to the presence of nucleic acid repulsion forces. Fig. 9. Proposed mechanism contributing to biofilm inhibition on LIS surface. Open in a new tab Both bacteria and nucleic acids possess a negative charge. a When the nucleic acids get immobilized on the LIS surface, this creates a layer of negatively charged molecules that can repel bacteria through ionic forces. b Bacteria can attach to areas of the LIS where there is a gap in the oil coat, previously destabilized. c Biofilms form in these gap areas but grow with sharp edges due to the repulsive forces on the borders. In solid abiotic surfaces, the deposition of eDNA is required for initial microcolony formation in P. aeruginosa biofilms74–77. The eDNA is located in the active migration zone of the biofilm and plays a role in its expansion78. Thus, the nucleic acid layer on LIS could represent a risk of delayed/increased biofilm formation for long term. However, it is possible that the orientation and immobilization of DNA/RNA plays a role in adhesion inhibition. In addition, the physics of bacterial interactions at interfaces (specially oil/water interfaces) is unclear and can differ from usual biofilm formation79. More tests with longer incubation periods are needed to determine the time limit (if any) of the observed biofilm inhibition on LIS. Although LIS is typically stable, it is possible that protein/RNA acted as a surfactant and led to destabilization of the oil80. The biofilm increased expression of rhlC in microgravity could have resulted in increased rhamnolipid (biosurfactants)81 production, contributing to such destabilization. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa planktonic cells in microgravity have been reported to produce larger amounts of rhamnolipids and this could be the case for biofilms on LIS as well82. The gene expression analysis of biofilms formed on LIS with respect to SS suggests several other hypotheses of mechanisms contributing to the reduced biofilm formation: (1) Increased expression of pyochelin genes (on Earth and in microgravity) and of rhamnolipid genes (only on Earth), which are produced in nitrogen-limited environments83, could reflect exacerbated nutrient depletion in the extracellular environment of LIS biofilms in comparison with SS. It is possible that the lubricant oil could be self-spreading over the biofilms19 and thereby limiting nutrient transport. (2) Increased expression of rhamnolipid genes, including estA, an esterase that promotes rhamnolipid production84. Rhamnolipids sometimes lead to biofilm detachment83. (3) Increased apoptosis as observed in previous spaceflight studies34. Apoptosis of biofilms on LIS could be mediated by the increased expression of rpoS on Earth (global stress regulator), underexpression of antitoxins on Earth (higA, PA14_21720) or increased expression of toxins in microgravity (PA14_28120) with respect to SS. We acknowledge that transcriptome changes are not direct evidence of protein levels nor cell functions, and that more tests are needed to confirm these hypotheses. It is important to consider that growing biofilms over LIS could affect virulence and antimicrobial resistance. However, predicting such an effect is complicated as there is gene expression evidence for increasing and decreasing effects compared to SS. On one side, biofilms on LIS had increased expression of the virulence factors pyochelin and rhamnolipids. On the other side, biofilms on LIS presented a general decreased expression of type 6 secretion systems from the HSI-I loci, which could make them less capable of establishing chronic infections85. LIS seems to prevent the first stage of biofilm formation: cell attachment. Nevertheless, more tests and analysis are needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. In parallel, elucidating the functions of the uncharacterized genes that were differentially expressed on LIS with respect to SS can provide further insight. Based on the minimized biofilm formation on LIS in microgravity, it presents itself as a good option for use in spacecraft components. In addition, the use of directly immobilized DNA/RNA over surfaces (e.g., using covalent bonding, physical adsorption, or streptavidin-biotin immobilization86,87) should also be explored to reduce bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in susceptible spacecraft components. Biofilms on LIS in microgravity seemed to remain in the microcolony stage for days 2 and 3, which could explain the limited differential gene expression between 1-day-old biofilms and 3-day-old biofilms. 3-day-old SS biofilm gene expression profile suggests a potential decrease in metabolic activity (reduced nitrogen metabolism) and quorum sensing signaling (reduced expression of Las and Rhl systems) with respect to 1-day-old biofilms. Further tests are needed to confirm such hypothesis but it agrees with SS biofilm morphology, as expression of these systems decreases as biofilm height increases88. Bacterial growth dynamics can differ in space with respect to behavior observed on Earth89. Hence, it must be noted that comparing bacterial cultures and biofilms from a given moment in time (e.g., “day 3”) may be doing so at different stages of growth, e.g., in a gravitational condition it may still be at the end of exponential phase while at another it may already be stationary. Acknowledging the limitation of getting data from three instantaneous moments in time in our experiment, we recommend that future studies (i) acquire continuous data as possible, and (ii) also characterize the growth stage and gene expression of the planktonic cell culture. Staining protocols may be improved with the use of a third dye to target polysaccharides. Furthermore, future studies may interrogate our observations further by determining the precise composition of the nucleic acid layer observed on LIS. Future studies, namely those focused on spacecraft water processing assemblies may improve on the fidelity of their study by using Ersatz Wastewater formulation to replicate the wastewater as received on the ISS’ system, extend the duration of the experiment to multiples of months as applicable, and the substrate material may be changed to that of the specific component being studied.",

Copyright notice ID: 10432549 PMID: 37587131 Abstract The undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial biofilms in spacecraft poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to astronauts’ health. To mitigate the risks that arise from them, it is important to understand biofilms’ behavior in microgravity. As part of the Space Biofilms project, biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in spaceflight over material surfaces. Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use. Transcriptomic profiles for the different conditions are presented, and potential mechanisms of biofilm reduction on LIS are discussed. Subject terms: Microbiology, Molecular biology, Aerospace engineeringIntroduction In previous and current spaces stations (Salyut-6 and -7, Mir, and the International Space Station (ISS)), damage caused by bacterial biofilms on hardware have resulted in function disruption and failures of myriad equipment (summarized in Zea et al., 2018, 20201,2). On the ISS, biofilms are a concern for the water recovery system, particularly for the water processing assembly’s wastewater tank and its downstream filter3,4, as well as for the hoses linking the distillation assembly to the purge and fluid pumps, which have needed to be returned to Earth for unclogging and reprocessing before sent back to ISS (Y.A. Velez-Justiniano, personal communication, June 10, 2022). Biofilms are communities of microbes attached to each other and to surfaces which can cause damage to materials either directly by using it as food, or indirectly via their metabolic byproducts5,6. While pre-planned biofilms may enable useful processes in space7–9, uncontrolled growth—especially of opportunistic or pathogenic microbes—may have another deleterious effect for space missions: increased risk of infections to the crew. Microbial communities living as biofilms can have increased tolerance to disinfectants and antibiotics10, which may contribute to recurrent infections. On Earth, biofilms are associated with 65% and 80% of infectious and chronic diseases, respectively11. Materials can profoundly influence biofilm growth, and it is possible to design surfaces that either prevent microbial adhesion or that have antimicrobial properties. Antimicrobial surfaces include those with metallic nanoparticles with biocidal effects12 and strongly oxidizing materials that destroy cell membranes13. However, biocidal surfaces have a critical failure mechanism when a layer of destroyed cells forms on the initial surface. This layer can provide a safe harbor for new microbes to colonize. Preventing initial adhesion of microbes via engineering of surface properties addresses this limitation. Surface roughness provides initial colonizers with favorable positions to adhere to a surface, and therefore smooth surfaces tend to be more successful at preventing adhesion14. Hydrophobicity is another property that is particularly focused on in the context of creating adhesion-free surfaces; however, the influence is a complicated one. In general, hydrophobic surfaces may cause greater initial attachment due to hydrophobic interactions between the surface and the cell membranes, but also allow larger detachment rates14. The fast pace of microbial adaptation and changes in gene expression also presents a significant challenge for creation of anti-biofouling materials. Microorganism behavior is significantly altered by the presence of different surfaces. For example, biofilm morphologies differ strongly across steel and polypropylene surfaces15, and gene expression is altered for microbes exposed to less habitable surfaces16,17. Therefore, even surfaces engineered to resist biofilms may not be immune to bacteria colonization. Biofilm growth in space stations and surface habitat components can decrease the probability of mission success and increase that of medical risks to the crew. Crewed missions to the Lunar surface and Mars, the latter requiring several years in space, warrant understanding of how biofilms grow differently in microgravity, as system functionality is of even higher importance when receiving spare parts from Earth or returning crew to Earth promptly is not possible. To address this, the NASA-funded Space Biofilms project was designed as described in Zea et al. 20181, and prepared and performed on board the ISS as reported in Flores et al., 202218. In brief, samples of Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 (PA14) were sent to the ISS and biofilms were allowed to grow on different surfaces for either one, two, or three days at 37 °C. Equivalent biofilms grown on Earth at 1 g were used as controls. The six material surfaces tested were stainless steel 316 (SS316), passivated SS316 (pSS316), a silicon wafer impregnated with silicone oil as a lubricant-impregnated surface (LIS)19, cellulose membrane, silicone, and silicone with a microtopography. Each condition tested had four replicates fixed in 4% PFA for morphology analysis, and other four preserved in RNAlater for gene expression analysis. Here, we report the morphological and transcriptomic results of SS316, pSS316, and LIS grown in nutrient-rich medium (to replicate wastewater); the rest are reported elsewhere20. SS316 and pSS316 were assessed given their common use for spacecraft components and for elements of the Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), respectively. LIS was tested as a potential alternative for future spacecraft parts most susceptible to biofilm formation. SS316 is an iron alloy containing chromium, nickel, and molybdenum characteristic for its increased resistance to corrosion compared to iron21. The passivation of SS316 uses a nitric or citric acid treatment to eliminate iron from the surface and generate an oxide passive layer to prevent corrosion22. LISs are a class of textured surfaces that are stably impregnated with a lubricant (e.g., oils) to render the surface with super-slippery properties19,23 (Fig. 1). The lubricant is held within the texture by capillary and intermolecular forces. A drop on LIS can exist in one of twelve different thermodynamic states depending on the properties of the solid texture, lubricant, droplet, and environment. Stable impregnation of the lubricant requires the contact angle of the lubricant on solid surface to be below a critical value set by the texture parameters. For the case of stable LIS, the texture tops can remain exposed or covered by a thin van der Waals lubricant film depending on the spreading coefficient of the lubricant on the solid surface (in the presence of droplet phase). A detailed discussion of the thermodynamic states, stable impregnation criteria, and droplet mobility are provided in Smith et al. (2013)19. Because a significant portion of the surface texture can stay submerged in the lubricant (except for texture tops) for stable LIS, these surfaces can achieve significant reduction in adhesion and have been shown to have remarkable antifouling properties24–30.

Scale bars are 400 nm.Results The biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage of biofilms formed on SS316 were not statistically different from those of biofilms grown on pSS316 (α = 0.05) at any incubation day (Supplementary Figure 1 and raw data in Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, no morphological differences were observed between biofilms formed on the two materials (Supplementary Figure 2) for either Earth-based or microgravity cultures. In addition, there were no differentially expressed genes (DEG) between SS316 and pSS316 biofilms in any conditions tested (α = 0.05) except for microgravity day 2 where pSS316 had 44 DEG (Supplementary Table 2). Based on this, SS316 and pSS316 were pooled into one “SS” data set which is hereon compared and contrasted to that of biofilms formed on LIS. Biofilm morphology and observations from the liquid cultures In 1 g, biofilms on SS grew throughout the surface with no marked boundaries, usually creating conglomerates that formed ‘mounts’ of biofilm with dispersed single cells in between (Fig. 2a). Conversely, the few biofilms grown on LIS were restricted to certain areas with sharp edges, had a more compact appearance, and looked thicker (not significant) than those grown on SS (Fig. 2b). In addition, the LIS surface showed individual cells or small multiple cell groups attached in random isolated areas and a thin layer of nucleic acids in the areas where there was no biofilm. Bacterial cells attached on LIS were often found growing in the perimeter or inside of a circle (as seen for 1-day-old biofilms on 1 g) as well as small, connected clusters. Overall, biofilms on LIS seemed to be restricted to grow in smaller areas than on SS. Fig. 2. P. aeruginosa biofilm morphology on SS and LIS in 1 g or microgravity. Open in a new tab Representative confocal microscopy images of 1-, 2-, and 3-day-old biofilms formed over SS and LIS. Nucleic acids were stained with PI (red) and lipids were stained with Green Biofilm (green). First row per material is a bottom slice image with side-view panels of a cross-section point in the biofilm (specific section marked by the orange lines). Second row per material is a volume view of the complete z-stack image. Images correspond to biofilms grown in 1 g over a SS and b LIS, or for biofilms grown in microgravity over c SS and d LIS. Negative controls of the material surfaces, stained with both PI and Green Biofilm stains, are presented in panel (e). Scale bars are 20 µm. Biofilms form without boundaries on SS while on LIS they have sharp edges. Biofilms had significantly reduced surface area coverage on LIS, especially in microgravity where biofilms were minimized and mostly present as small groups of cells. The thin layer of nucleic acids on LIS surface could be DNA, RNA, or both as PI does not differentiate between them.The morphology of biofilms formed on SS in space was similar to that of the Earth controls, in that the space samples also exhibited a lack of clear boundaries and biofilm ‘mounts’ were also observed, albeit with bigger gaps between them (Fig. 2c). Biofilms grown on LIS in microgravity did not form as many sharp, compact, and thick biofilms (only a few in smaller size) compared to those formed in 1 g (Fig. 2d). The thickness of these smaller biofilms decreased in time (p < 0.001). Most of the surface of LIS was covered with a thin layer of nucleic acids (red signal from the propidium iodide (PI) stain). The PI did not partition to LIS’s silicone oil in the absence of bacteria, nor did the Green Biofilm stain (green signal to label lipids) (Fig. 2e) confirming that the signal on the biofilm samples corresponds to adsorbed nucleic acids on LIS’s surface. The PA14 liquid cultures in which the coupons were submerged became more turbid (turbidity correlation with viable cell count available in Supplementary Figure 3) for the microgravity set than for the 1 g controls (not significant for SS day 1 and SS day 2). Specifically, for the samples cultured for three days, when OD600 in microgravity had an increase of 41.3% for SS (p = 2.9e−08) and 23.4% for LIS (p = 0.0204) (Supplementary Figure 4 and raw data in Supplementary Table 3). In addition, it is worth noting that the color of the liquid culture changed as well. In microgravity, the cultures were light green on day 1, light brown on day 2, and light pink on day 3, while the ground cultures remained clear for days 1 and 2 and then turned light yellow on day 3 (Supplementary Figure 5). The increased culture turbidity in microgravity could suggest more bacterial growth in general; however, microgravity biofilms exhibited the opposite trend.Biofilm biomass, thickness, and surface coverage PA14 biofilms formed in microgravity had significantly lower (p ≤ 0.05) biomass (Fig. 3), and thickness (Fig. 4) than those formed at 1 g. This is true for both SS and LIS, the only exception being for the biofilms formed on LIS at one day of incubation, which exhibited no difference between gravitational regimes. In the case of SS, by day 3 biofilms formed in microgravity had only 17.6% and 53.6% of the ground control biomass and thickness, respectively. The same phenomenon was observed on LIS, where biofilms formed in space had 8.7% and 21.3% of the ground control biomass and thickness. Furthermore, biofilms formed in space covered significantly less surface than their 1 g counterparts (31.4% and 33.0% of surface area for SS and LIS, respectively) (Fig. 5).

The SS and LIS biofilms on 1 g appeared to grow in size with time, with the largest growth observed between day 1 and day 2 (Figs. 2a,b, 3, 4, 5). This trend also held true for SS in microgravity; although with a lower growth rate (Figs. 2c, 3, 4, 5). For biofilms on LIS in microgravity, there was little to no change in mass and surface area coverage as a function of time. Biofilms grown on SS were significantly different than biofilms grown on LIS in terms of mass and surface area coverage. On both Earth and in microgravity, at day 3, the median of biomass and surface area coverage in LIS was significantly lower (p ≤ 0.001) than in SS biofilms (Table 1).Gene expression of biofilms in microgravity vs biofilms on 1 g Bacteria adapt to their environment through gene expression modulation. The mechanisms used by bacteria to adapt to changes can be observed in their transcriptomic profile. The following paragraphs compare 3-day-old biofilms formed in microgravity against matched Earth controls (baseline) for either SS or LIS surfaces. When available, the PAO1 ortholog gene numbers are listed in the brackets at the first mention of the corresponding PA14 gene. For SS, biofilms showed five DEG in microgravity with a fold change ≥2 (Fig. 6a, b, raw data in Supplementary Table 5). Three had increased expression (rsmY [PA0527.1], rmf [PA3049], pchB [PA4230]), and the remaining two had decreased expression in microgravity (PA14_63220 [PA4782], PA14_21970 [PA3249]). A KEGG pathways enrichment analysis was performed to understand at a bigger scale the more subtle changes (including the <2-fold changes) caused by microgravity (Supplementary Figure 6). No significant enrichments were found with >2-fold, but it showed the “nitrogen metabolism” pathway enriched (Supplementary Figure 7) in the space samples (1.02-fold). In addition, analyses were focused on genes involved in P. aeruginosa virulence and antimicrobial resistance. Despite pchB (2.2-fold) being the only gene in the virulome differentially expressed >2-fold, the other five genes involved in pyochelin production also had significant increased expression in microgravity for biofilms grown over SS (Fig. 6c): pchI (1.4-fold) [PA4222], pchE (1.9-fold) [PA4226], pchD (1.5-fold) [PA4228], pchC (1.9-fold) [PA4229], and fptA (1.8-fold) [PA4221]. There was no significant effect >2-fold in the resistome. Fig. 6. Transcriptional differences between P. aeruginosa biofilms formed on SS in space with respect to Earth.

Sample F16.5 was not considered an outlier because the expression of the rest of the genes was similar to the other samples and no problems were found in the quality control steps. n = 7 biological replicates per gravitational condition.For LIS, biofilms in microgravity had only one DEG – PA14_08190 (−6.4-fold, raw data in Supplementary Table 6)—which codes for a hypothetical protein. This suggests that biofilms on Earth and in space formed over LIS have virtually the same transcriptome. Futures tests in microgravity should confirm if this holds true at the protein level and should consider studying the function of PA14_08190.Gene expression of biofilms on LIS vs biofilms on SS The following paragraphs describe the results of the gene expression analyses performed to compare 3-day-old biofilms grown on LIS with respect to 3-day-old biofilms grown on SS (baseline). The first paragraph focuses on results under Earth’s gravity and the second paragraph for results in microgravity. On Earth, biofilms grown on LIS had 310 DEG with a fold change ≥2 (Fig. 7a, b, raw data in Supplementary Table 7) when compared to SS biofilms. The top five DEG were PA14_09380 [PA4218], pchC, PA14_06170 [PA1911], PA14_52500 [PA0909], and pchE; all with increased expression on LIS. Gene PA14_52500 is annotated as coding for a hypothetical protein and had the highest fold change (3.9) of all. Some of the genes that code for alginate production had significantly increased expression on LIS (below 2-fold): mucB (1.2-fold) [PA0764], mucD (1.1-fold) [PA0766], algR (1.5-fold) [PA5261], mucE (1.9-fold) [PA4033], mucP (1.4-fold) [PA3649]. The pathways enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure 8) showed the “carbon metabolism” pathway as the most enriched on LIS (1.1-fold) (Supplementary Figure 9). On Earth, the virulome presented several genes of Hcp secretion island I (HSI-I), type three secretion systems (TTSS), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and pyocyanin with decreased expression in LIS with respect to SS (Fig. 7c). Conversely, almost all the genes involved in synthesis of pyochelin had increased expression on LIS (>2.5-fold): pchI (3.1-fold), pchH (2.6-fold) [PA4223], pchG (2.7-fold) [PA4224], pchF (3.1-fold) [PA4225], pchE (3.1-fold), pchD (2.5-fold), pchC (3.1-fold), pchB (3.2-fold), pchA (3.0-fold) [PA4231], fptA (2.6-fold). In the resistome, gene nouJ [PA2645] had 2.2-fold increased expression on LIS. In addition, genes involved in apoptosis were differentially expressed on LIS biofilms, rpoS [PA3622] had increased expression (2.4-fold) and the antitoxins higA [PA4674] and PA14_21720 [PA2489] had decreased expression (−1.4 and −2.4-fold, respectively).

For SS, n = 7 biological replicates. For LIS, n = 4 biological replicates.In microgravity, biofilms grown on LIS had 425 DEG with a fold change >2 (Fig. 8a, b, raw data in Supplementary Table 8) when compared to SS. The top five DEG were PA14_27520 (−5.5-fold) [PA2826], PA14_44920 (−3.1-fold) [PA1509], PA14_20060 (3.7-fold), PA14_51580 (−4.0-fold), and estA (3.1-fold) [PA5112]. Three of these top five DEG code for hypothetical proteins that have not been characterized. In microgravity, no pathways were significantly enriched or depleted for LIS vs SS. Interestingly, the observations made on the virulome when comparing LIS with SS on Earth, remain true for biofilms on LIS in microgravity: HSI-I, TTSS, LPS, and pyocyanin-synthesis associated genes had reduced expression while genes associated with pyochelin and rhamnolipids had increased expression (Fig. 8c) with respect to SS. There was no increased expression of alginate-associated genes on LIS in microgravity, which differs to what was seen on Earth. In microgravity, the resistome of biofilms on LIS had increased expression of mexT (2.3-fold) [PA2492] and galU (2.1-fold) [PA2023], and decreased expression of ampD (−3.1) [PA4522]. Finally, when comparing LIS with respect to SS, no significant differences in gene expression of rpoS or higA were observed in microgravity, but one putative toxin (PA14_28120 [PA2781]) presented a 1.4-fold increased expression.

The following paragraphs describe the results of the gene expression analyses performed to compare biofilms grown on SS for 3 days with respect to biofilms grown on SS for 1 day (baseline). The first paragraph focuses on results under Earth’s gravity and the second paragraph for results in microgravity. On Earth, 3-day-old biofilms exhibited 115 DEG with fold change >2 (Supplementary Figure 10a, 10b, raw data in Supplementary Table 10) with respect to 1-day-old biofilms. The top five DEG at day three had decreased expression (PA14_40310 [PA1869], trxB2 [PA0849], PA14_39700, PA14_10380 [PA4139], nirN [PA0509]). PA14_10380, the most differentially expressed (−5.2-fold), codes for a hypothetical protein. With respect to day one, day three had increased expression of several genes involved in production of Psl extracellular matrix polysaccharide, in particular pslO (3.1-fold) [PA2245]. The pathways enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure 11) showed several depleted pathways at day three; “sulfur relay system” was the most depleted (−2.0-fold) (Supplementary Figure 12), followed by “nitrogen metabolism” (−1.7-fold) (Supplementary Figure 13). In the virulome of day three (Supplementary Figure 10c) there was a reduction in expression of genes in the Las (lasA −2.2-fold [PA1871], lasB −2.3-fold [PA3724]) and Rhl systems (rhlA −2.3-fold [PA3479], rhlB −2.2-fold [PA3478]), and of gene algP/algR3 (−2.1-fold) involved in alginate synthesis. Regarding the resistome on Earth, day three presented decreased expression of genes that code for RND efflux pumps and outer membrane proteins: mexH (−2.1-fold) [PA4206], ompA (−2.6-fold) [PA3692], opmD (−2.3-fold) [PA4208]. In microgravity, 3-day-old biofilms showed 70 DEG with fold change ≥2 (Supplementary Figure S14a, S14b, raw data in Supplementary Table 11) with respect to 1-day-old biofilms. The top five DEG at day three correspond to: PA14_40310 (−2.6-fold), malQ (−3.1-fold) [PA2163], PA14_36650 (−3.7-fold) [PA2159], PA14_72370 (−5.1-fold) [PA5482] and pchF (3.2-fold). Again, the most differentially (under)expressed gene (PA14_72370) codes for a hypothetical protein. There was no systemic increased expression of extracellular matrix polysaccharides on day three in microgravity, but as on the ground, the gene trxB2 (−2.3-fold) and the cytochrome c gene cluster (including nirN −2.1-fold) had decreased expression. The pathways enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure 15) showed three depleted pathways at day three in microgravity; “Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism” is the most depleted (−2.0-fold) (Supplementary Figure 16). In the virulome (Supplementary Figure 14c), rhlA (−2.2-fold) was less expressed on day three (as seen on Earth) while all pyochelin-associated genes had increased expression (pchI 2.1-fold, pchH 2.4-fold, pchG 3.5-fold, pchF 3.2-fold, pchE 3.2-fold, pchR 1.3-fold [PA4227], pchD 2.6-fold, pchC 2.8-fold, pchB 3.3-fold, pchA 3.5-fold, fptA 2.5-fold). In the resistome, ompA (−2.4-fold) showed a reduced expression on day three in microgravity, as seen in the ground samples.Discussion In this experiment, biofilm shape and general structure appearance was not affected by gravitational regime. Contrary to what has been previously reported for anaerobic P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm growth in space31, we observed less robust biofilms in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage in microgravity with respect to 1 g. In microgravity, the increased expression of rmf, in charge of ribosomal hibernation32 during stationary phase33, could be indicative of a substrate-limited and byproduct-abundant extracellular environment for biofilms over SS, as the one theorized to occur in microgravity for non-motile planktonic cells34,35. Such an environment could be partially attributed to the increased planktonic cell growth in microgravity, increasing the accumulation of metabolic byproducts and depletion of nutrients, and potentially the cause of reduced biofilm formation. Proteomic analysis and functional analysis are needed to confirm these hypotheses. Starvation environmental conditions can trigger biofilm dispersal in P. aeruginosa36,37. However, the genes known to be involved in biofilm dispersion38—dipA [PA5017]39,40, rbdA [PA0861]41, nbdA [PA3311]42,43, gcbA [PA4843]44, and bdlA [PA1423]39—were not differentially expressed in microgravity. Thus, biofilm dispersal could be regulated by other gene(s) in microgravity. Potentially, the increased planktonic growth and decreased biofilm formation are not a consequence of biofilm dispersion. For SS, the most DEG in microgravity was rsmY. RsmY (small non-coding RNA) controls broad gene expression in P. aeruginosa through the sequestering of RsmA (gene repressor)45. RsmA targets the mRNAs of genes mvaT [PA4315], pchB, pchC, pchD, and pchE46 and, those genes demonstrated increased expression in microgravity. We hypothesize that RsmY could be regulating some of the biggest transcriptional changes observed in biofilms grown over SS in microgravity. It is worth nothing that DEG PA14_63220 and PA14_21970 code for a hypothetical protein and a transcriptional regulator, respectively, that have not yet been characterized and whose functions could shed light to the changes observed in microgravity. Moreover, this could be specific for biofilms growing on SS, only for biofilms past microcolony stages, or both, as biofilms on LIS did not have increased expression of rsmY in microgravity. Our results suggest potential increased virulence of PA14 3-day-old biofilms on SS in microgravity through increased expression of pyochelin. Pyochelin is secreted to chelate iron for bacterial use47 and the outer membrane receptor, FptA, internalizes it. In addition, pyochelin production in biofilms is characteristic of aggressive and chronic infections48,49. Proteomic tests should confirm these results at protein level and on different surfaces. The green, brown, and pink colors of the liquid culture in microgravity could be attributed to the production of pigmented virulence factors such as pyoverdine (green-brown to green-yellow), pyorubin (red), pyocyanin (deep blue), pyomelanin (black)50. It appears that P. aeruginosa had an increased production of pyoverdine in the first days which then transitioned to an increased production of pyorubin. Interestingly biofilms in microgravity had no increased expression of pyoverdine, so the green-brown color in the liquid culture could be attributed to a higher production of this virulence factor by the planktonic cells. On the other hand, the pink color, possibly reflecting the production of pyorubin, could not be assessed as the genes involved in pyorubin production have not been identified in PA14, to our knowledge. These hypotheses need to be confirmed with transcriptomics and proteomics analyses of the planktonic cultures in future experiments. Nevertheless, the potential increased production of pigmented virulence factors of P. aeruginosa PA14 planktonic cells in microgravity, when grown in nutrient-rich medium, may pose a health risk for infections in space. Remarkably, LIS’s biofilm inhibition on Earth, was even greater in microgravity. Not only were biomass and surface area minimized, but these parameters stayed almost constant in time for microgravity biofilms on LIS. Coupled with the significant biofilm thickness reduction in time in microgravity, contrary to the increasing thickness trend on Earth, LIS performance in space makes it suitable to reduce biofilm formation in spacecraft components. Previous studies with different LISs show that this type of surfaces greatly reduce the attachment of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including P. aeruginosa)25,51–55. The liquid-like properties of LISs are believed to be the essential for the bacterial attachment inhibition56. Interestingly, biofilm formation on LIS was observed only in areas without the nucleic acid layer. We hypothesize that the thin layer of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or both) contributes to attachment inhibition. Nucleic acids have a hydrophilic phosphate backbone (negatively charged), and hydrophobic nitrogen bases57–59. It is possible that the interface between liquid culture and oil layer provided an ideal zone for DNA/RNA interaction, leading to their immobilization on the surface. It is well-established that oil/water interfaces can capture protein and nucleic acids60; and in some cases, the surface forces are strong enough to denature proteins60–67. Characterization of the protein adsorption/denaturing process on oil-infused textured surfaces, as LIS, remains to be done68,69. Thus, we hypothesize that the oil/water interface forces could be enough to destabilize extracellular DNA (eDNA), inducing conformational changes that result in its unzipping to ssDNA70, and that the DNA-associated proteins can be denatured to expose the DNA charges. Such that the hydrophobic portions of DNA/RNA partition into the oil of the LIS, leaving the hydrophilic phosphate backbone facing toward the aqueous culture. The mechanism of nucleic acid adsorption onto LIS surface and the exact composition of this layer remains to be elucidated and more tests are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (negatively charged due to its LPS) could be repelled by the phosphates of the nucleic acid layer (Fig. 9). Recent studies show reduced attachment of P. aeruginosa on surfaces with covalently attached and adsorbed DNA71, and on surfaces with DNA-poly(ethyleneimine) multilayers72. Staphylococcus was also repelled by multilayer chitosan-DNA coatings73. This hypothesis implies that DNA/RNA was released by the planktonic cells and attached to LIS early in the experiment. On LIS, biofilm’s reduced expression of LPS-related genes (on Earth and in microgravity) and increased expression of alginate (only on Earth)—a secreted polyanionic polysaccharide that helps mask LPS’s charge—could be related to the presence of nucleic acid repulsion forces. Fig. 9. Proposed mechanism contributing to biofilm inhibition on LIS surface. Open in a new tab Both bacteria and nucleic acids possess a negative charge. a When the nucleic acids get immobilized on the LIS surface, this creates a layer of negatively charged molecules that can repel bacteria through ionic forces. b Bacteria can attach to areas of the LIS where there is a gap in the oil coat, previously destabilized. c Biofilms form in these gap areas but grow with sharp edges due to the repulsive forces on the borders.In solid abiotic surfaces, the deposition of eDNA is required for initial microcolony formation in P. aeruginosa biofilms74–77. The eDNA is located in the active migration zone of the biofilm and plays a role in its expansion78. Thus, the nucleic acid layer on LIS could represent a risk of delayed/increased biofilm formation for long term. However, it is possible that the orientation and immobilization of DNA/RNA plays a role in adhesion inhibition. In addition, the physics of bacterial interactions at interfaces (specially oil/water interfaces) is unclear and can differ from usual biofilm formation79. More tests with longer incubation periods are needed to determine the time limit (if any) of the observed biofilm inhibition on LIS. Although LIS is typically stable, it is possible that protein/RNA acted as a surfactant and led to destabilization of the oil80. The biofilm increased expression of rhlC in microgravity could have resulted in increased rhamnolipid (biosurfactants)81 production, contributing to such destabilization. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa planktonic cells in microgravity have been reported to produce larger amounts of rhamnolipids and this could be the case for biofilms on LIS as well82. The gene expression analysis of biofilms formed on LIS with respect to SS suggests several other hypotheses of mechanisms contributing to the reduced biofilm formation: (1) Increased expression of pyochelin genes (on Earth and in microgravity) and of rhamnolipid genes (only on Earth), which are produced in nitrogen-limited environments83, could reflect exacerbated nutrient depletion in the extracellular environment of LIS biofilms in comparison with SS. It is possible that the lubricant oil could be self-spreading over the biofilms19 and thereby limiting nutrient transport. (2) Increased expression of rhamnolipid genes, including estA, an esterase that promotes rhamnolipid production84. Rhamnolipids sometimes lead to biofilm detachment83. (3) Increased apoptosis as observed in previous spaceflight studies34. Apoptosis of biofilms on LIS could be mediated by the increased expression of rpoS on Earth (global stress regulator), underexpression of antitoxins on Earth (higA, PA14_21720) or increased expression of toxins in microgravity (PA14_28120) with respect to SS. We acknowledge that transcriptome changes are not direct evidence of protein levels nor cell functions, and that more tests are needed to confirm these hypotheses. It is important to consider that growing biofilms over LIS could affect virulence and antimicrobial resistance. However, predicting such an effect is complicated as there is gene expression evidence for increasing and decreasing effects compared to SS. On one side, biofilms on LIS had increased expression of the virulence factors pyochelin and rhamnolipids. On the other side, biofilms on LIS presented a general decreased expression of type 6 secretion systems from the HSI-I loci, which could make them less capable of establishing chronic infections85. LIS seems to prevent the first stage of biofilm formation: cell attachment. Nevertheless, more tests and analysis are needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. In parallel, elucidating the functions of the uncharacterized genes that were differentially expressed on LIS with respect to SS can provide further insight. Based on the minimized biofilm formation on LIS in microgravity, it presents itself as a good option for use in spacecraft components. In addition, the use of directly immobilized DNA/RNA over surfaces (e.g., using covalent bonding, physical adsorption, or streptavidin-biotin immobilization86,87) should also be explored to reduce bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in susceptible spacecraft components. Biofilms on LIS in microgravity seemed to remain in the microcolony stage for days 2 and 3, which could explain the limited differential gene expression between 1-day-old biofilms and 3-day-old biofilms. 3-day-old SS biofilm gene expression profile suggests a potential decrease in metabolic activity (reduced nitrogen metabolism) and quorum sensing signaling (reduced expression of Las and Rhl systems) with respect to 1-day-old biofilms. Further tests are needed to confirm such hypothesis but it agrees with SS biofilm morphology, as expression of these systems decreases as biofilm height increases88. Bacterial growth dynamics can differ in space with respect to behavior observed on Earth89. Hence, it must be noted that comparing bacterial cultures and biofilms from a given moment in time (e.g., “day 3”) may be doing so at different stages of growth, e.g., in a gravitational condition it may still be at the end of exponential phase while at another it may already be stationary. Acknowledging the limitation of getting data from three instantaneous moments in time in our experiment, we recommend that future studies (i) acquire continuous data as possible, and (ii) also characterize the growth stage and gene expression of the planktonic cell culture. Staining protocols may be improved with the use of a third dye to target polysaccharides. Furthermore, future studies may interrogate our observations further by determining the precise composition of the nucleic acid layer observed on LIS. Future studies, namely those focused on spacecraft water processing assemblies may improve on the fidelity of their study by using Ersatz Wastewater formulation to replicate the wastewater as received on the ISS’ system, extend the duration of the experiment to multiples of months as applicable, and the substrate material may be changed to that of the specific component being studied.Methods Reagents and hardware The reagents and hardware were prepared as described in Flores et al. (2022)18. In brief, the PBS was prepared with PBS pellets (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. P4417) and autoclaved. The 1X LBK medium was LB Lennox (Sigma, Cat. L3022) supplemented with 0.86% potassium nitrate (Sigma, Cat. P8291) and filter sterilized with 0.22 µm filters (Nalgene, Cat. 566-0020). LBK medium was prepared at 1.18X concentration to load in the hardware to account for dilution during experiment activation. The 11.4% PFA solution was prepared by diluting 16% PFA (Alfa Aesar, Cat. 43368) with PBS. When mixed with the sample it yields a final concentration of 4% PFA. The RNAlater (Invitrogen, Cat. AM7021) was refrigerated prior to loading it in the hardware to induce the formation of RNAlater crystals. These crystals were then pulverized and the RNAlater was loaded cold into the hardware. Preemptive formation and pulverization of the RNAlater crystals avoided the formation of long crystals during launch (4 °C) that could cause sample loss, early activation, and leaks by displacing the hardware chambers. After sample incubation, the RNAlater was still efficient at preserving RNA from biofilms18. BioServe’s FPA housed in the Group Activation Pack (GAP) were used as both ground and flight sample hardware. The FPA hardware components were cleaned with 1% Liquinox (Alconox, Cat. 1201-1), coated with sigmacote (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. SL2), and dried at 100 °C for 30 min to siliconize the glass and facilitate sample assembly.Bacterial strain and Inoculum All the biofilm experiments were performed using Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 strain, which was kindly provided by Dr. George O’Toole. This strain was selected for the project to replicate the column-and-canopy biofilm structure previously observed in microgravity by Kim et al. (2013)31 when growing PA14 biofilms over cellulose membrane. The results of the biofilms grown over cellulose membrane are reported in a separate publication20. The bacterial inoculum was prepared with 6 ml of LBK media inoculated with PA14 and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h (final OD595 0.706). The overnight inoculum was diluted 1:100 with PBS (final OD595 0.001) to maintain cells in stasis. The diluted inoculum was used to load the second chamber of FPAs.Test surface preparation Biofilms were grown on 1 cm2 material coupons of SS316 (MPPR-311-6), pSS316, and LIS. SS316 coupons were cleaned with 1% Liquinox (Alconox Cat. 1201-1). For the pSS316, clean SS316 coupons were passivated with citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. C-8385). Preparation of LIS coupons (silicon wafer impregnated with silicone oil) has been described in detail previously1,18,19. LIS coupons were not cleaned, to avoid removing the silicone oil, but they were prepared in sterile conditions. LIS’s silicone oil layer (0.5–1.5 µm in thickness) has no bactericidal nor growth boost effect on P. aeruginosa PA1418.Sample preparation A total of 144 samples were prepared, 72 for flight and 72 for corresponding ground controls. All coupons were prepared in the same fashion. Each gravitational condition tested three material surfaces (SS316, pSS316, and LIS), three biofilm incubation times (1, 2, or 3 days), and two termination reagents (PFA for morphology analysis and RNAlater for transcriptomics) with four replicates per condition. Flight samples were sent to the ISS on the Cygnus NG-12 spacecraft. Double-sided tape (3 M, Cat. 9731) was placed on the backside of the coupons to adhere them onto the inserts. Adhered coupons on inserts were installed in the FPAs and autoclaved. FPAs were loaded with 2.75 ml of sterile 1.18X LBK and the first chamber was closed with a second insert. The use of solid inserts prevents gas exchange and forces anaerobic growth of P. aeruginosa. The first chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h as a contamination check. Afterward, the second chamber was loaded with 0.5 ml of the PA14 inoculum in stasis and closed with a rubber septum. The third and last chamber was filled with 1.75 ml of PFA or RNAlater and closed with a rubber septum. Eight FPAs with the three-chamber configuration were assembled into each GAP and transferred to 4 °C.Biofilm formation assays Spaceflight samples were launched in stasis (in PBS and at 4 °C) to the ISS to avoid bacterial growth before microgravity conditions were achieved. Once in microgravity, astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch activated the spaceflight samples by combining the first and second chambers of the FPAs, which introduced the inoculum into the culture media. Samples were incubated at 37 °C inside BioServe’s Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) for the designated incubation times (1, 2, or 3 days) in anaerobic conditions. At the end of incubation, the third chamber was introduced to fix (PFA) or preserve (RNAlater) the samples in microgravity, and samples were transferred to 4 °C or −80 °C, respectively, until unberthing. Fixed and preserved samples then returned to Earth at 4 °C and −20 °C, respectively. Once on Earth, samples were stored at 4 °C (fixed) and −80 °C (preserved) until sample processing. Ground samples were performed asynchronously, activating and terminating two hours later to replicate the order of flight procedures. The temperature profile of spaceflight samples was also reproduced for the ground samples. When spaceflight samples returned to Earth, all coupons (both flight and ground) were recovered from the FPAs and processed for morphology analysis (PFA) or transcriptomic analysis (RNAlater).Planktonic cell analysis Despite biofilms being the focus of our experiment, the planktonic cell culture of the samples was visually inspected with the naked eye for notorious changes between samples. In addition, the liquid cultures’ optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured. Samples were vortexed prior to measuring the OD600 to avoid cell clumping. Due to spaceflight constraints and the interest of fixing the samples while in microgravity, it was not possible to measure CFU/mL at experiment’s end. However, for P. aeruginosa PA14 in our experimental configuration, the OD600 measurements allow correct distinction of the bacterial stages of growth and are correlated to the viable cell density (Supplementary Figures 3 and 4).Biofilm morphology analysis To eliminate the planktonic cells, the coupons fixed in PFA were washed three times with 1 mL of PBS which was slowly poured on the walls of the wells to avoid disturbing the biofilm. The samples were stained with PI [15 µM] (PromoKine Cat. PK-CA707-40017 diluted with water) for 15 min and with FilmTracer™ FM™ 1-43 Green Biofilm [10 µg/ml] (Invitrogen Cat. F10317 diluted with DMSO and water as per manufacturer’s instructions) for 30 min under light-protected conditions. After each stain the samples were washed with 1 ml of PBS. Immediately after the wash, the PBS was removed and the stained samples were mounted onto glass slides; gorilla glue was used to adhere the coupon to the slide and the biofilm on top was covered with one drop of VectaShield HardSet™ Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Cat. H-1400-10) and a coverslip. Mounted samples were stored at 4 °C for 20 h protected from light prior to imaging, this allowed the mounting medium and glue to harden in order to avoid smearing the biofilm while imaging. Samples were imaged in groups of 4 per session (spaceflight samples with their corresponding ground controls in the same session). The Nikon SIM/A1 Laser scanning Confocal Microscope (inverted) of CU Boulder Light Microcopy Core Facility was used to take four 125 × 125 µm Z-stacks (30–40 slices with step size ranging from 0.1–1.5 µm, average 0.5 µm) per coupon, aligning the four fields of view to the center of the coupon. The biofilms were imaged with 100X SR Apo immersion oil objective (NA = 1.49 WD = 120 µm), using lasers 488 nm (green, emission filter 500–550 nm) and 561 nm (red, emission filter 575–625 nm). All images were acquired with 1.2 pinhole, laser power range (green and red = 0.1 to 2.3), offset range (green = −48 to 4, and red = −45 to 6), and PMT HV range (green = 3.0 to 86, red = 2.0 to 82) using the NIS Elements software. Images were taken with laser powers that avoided photobleaching and HV sensitivity settings that maximized the dynamic range without saturation. Resulting biofilm images were pseudo-colored with red (PI, nucleic acids) and green (Green Biofilm, lipids) for display with a linear LUT covering the full range of the data. Raw image files were used for quantitative analysis. First, Image J was used to merge both fluorescent channels and convert files from nd2 to tiff format. Then, the “Slice Remover” plugin was used to eliminate the slices with no biofilm signal from each Z-stack. The “Convert to OME-Tiff” macro was used to generate compatible files for analysis with the publicly available COMSTAT2 software90–92. COMSTAT2 calculated biofilm mass (µm3/µm2), thickness (µm), and surface area coverage (%) of the biofilms with automatic thresholding.Biofilm transcriptomic analyses Samples preserved in RNAlater were thawed at room temperature and washed 3 times with 1 ml PBS to get rid of any planktonic cells. PBS was removed and 1 ml of fresh RNAlater was added. The samples were ultrasonicated for 15 min at 40 kHz, followed by 5 min of vortexing to detach biofilm bacterial cells from the surface materials. RNA extraction was performed by University of Colorado Boulder BioFrontiers Sequencing Core and the sequencing by the Anschutz Genomics Shared Resource. The RNAlater with the suspended biofilm cells was centrifuged, and the pellet was used to extract total RNA using the Quick-RNA Fungal/Bacterial microprep Kit (Zymo Research Cat. R2010). RIN values were measured for the RNA extracted (Supplementary Table 12) RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3 (Takara Cat. 634485) and paired-end sequencing was performed on Illumina NOVASeq 6000 with 40 million reads per sample (Additional Transcriptomic information presented in Supplementary Table 13). Transcriptomic analysis was performed on CU Boulder’s RMACC Summit supercomputing cluster. Raw sequencing files were checked for quality control using FastQC (version 0.11.9)93 and multiQC (version 1.0.dev0)94. Then Illumina adapter contamination was eliminated using Trimgalore (version 0.6.6) with cutadapt (version 2.6)95, after which quality control was performed again. Trimmed reads were mapped to PA14 rRNA sequences to remove the contamination, the resulting unmapped reads were then mapped to the Ensembl Bacteria reference genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 (accession number GCA_000014625), both mapping steps were performed using Bowtie2 (version 2.4.4)96. The mapping results were sorted, indexed, and converted from .sam files to .bam files using SAMtools (version 1.11)97. The reads per gene were counted with Feature Counts (Rsubread package version 2.8.2)98, and differential gene expression analyses were done in an R (version 4.1.1)99 with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0)100. Pathways enrichment analyses were performed online using ESKAPE Act PLUS101 and the whole list of DEG (including ≤2-fold change genes) per condition as input.Statistics Morphology data was tested for parametric assumption compliance using Shapiro Wilk and Levene’s tests. The data did not comply with all the assumptions, thus non-parametric tests were used for all statistical analyses. Biofilm biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage data was compared between groups using two-sided Kruskal Wallis and Dunn’s (with Bonferroni correction) tests to determine if differences observed were significant. Significant differences have the significance level specified in parenthesis or in the plot (minimum of p-value < 0.05), while the non-significant values correspond to p-value > 0.05. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 using p-value < 0.05 as significance threshold, except for comparison between SS316 and pSS316 which used p-adj ≤ 0.05. Pathways enrichment analysis was performed with ESKAPE Act PLUS using a binomial test (FDR-corrected) with α = 0.05.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplemental Information (1.4MB, pdf) Supplementary Table 1 (21.2KB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 2 (14.7KB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 3 (14.9KB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 4 (20.3KB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 5 (1.1MB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 6 (400.2KB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 7 (922.4KB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 8 (801.1KB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 9 (41.9KB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 10 (1.7MB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 11 (1.7MB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 13 (5MB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (104.1KB, pdf) Acknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge the support and contributions from Rylee Schauer, Christina Koch, Jessica Meir, Carla Hoehn, Maggie Kolicko, Louis Stodieck, Stefanie Countryman, Joella Delheimer, Rebecca Bryan, Melissa Dunivant, Jim Wright, James Orth, Katrina Diener, Lily Allen, Amir Kalani, Anissa Becerra, Jim Voss, Shankini Doraisingam, Sridahr Gorti, Shawn Reagan, Stuart Tozer, Mark Rupert, Zeena Nisar, and Shilpi Ganguly.

    "abstract": "Abstract A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains at the start of the assay. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These data suggest that modification of DNA repair, signal transduction, and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this spaceflight production system. Keywords: algae, space environment, genetic fitness, population genetics, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii",
    "introduction": "Introduction Microalgae grow by converting light, water, and CO2 into biomass. Algae have long been proposed for space life support systems to recycle CO2 and provide food either directly or indirectly to astronauts (Brechignac and Schiller, 1992; Ai et al., 2008; Niederwieser et al., 2018; Matula and Nabity, 2019). Many species of microalgae are photosynthetically efficient under the limiting light and low volume conditions necessary in space production (Kliphuis et al., 2012). As single cell organisms, microalgae are easy to cultivate with minimal requirements, and have great potential to yield value-added products. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, such as Chlorella vulgaris and Arthrospira platensis, respectively, are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) for human consumption (Caporgno and Mathys, 2018). Algae have nutritional benefits with high levels of antioxidants and protein with essential amino acids (Buono et al., 2014). Algae are also rich in ω-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (Salem and Eggersdorfer, 2015). The red algal carotenoid, astaxanthin, has multiple uses including the ability to protect against retinal damage in animals (Wang et al., 2000; Katagiri et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2016; Otsuka et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2016). Algal oils may be used in future astronaut diets to help mitigate harmful effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation during spaceflight. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model organism for unicellular algae with a well-annotated genome sequence (Merchant et al., 2007). Although Chlamydomonas is not designated as a GRAS organism, feeding studies show no harmful effects of including significant amounts of algae biomass in animal feed (Baek et al., 2018; Murbach et al., 2018). Consequently, Chlamydomonas can be used as a model for other microalgae species, an animal feed for space food systems, or a feedstock for manufacturing. A few past studies exposed or grew algal species in space conditions (Mergenhagen and Mergenhagen, 1989; Wang et al., 2006; Giardi et al., 2013; Niederwieser et al., 2018). A Space Shuttle mission in 1985 used C. reinhardtii to examine phototaxic responses in microgravity (Mergenhagen and Mergenhagen, 1989). Microgravity allowed cells to remain close to light sources in spaceflight suggesting that photosynthetic productivity could be higher in space. By contrast, Wang et al. (2006) grew cyanobacteria for 15 days in a satellite and found reduced growth relative to a ground control. However, the ground control temperature and light cycles were not adjusted to the space conditions. The satellite had two temperature drops and two missed day photoperiods preventing strong conclusions from being drawn about growth rates. Giardi et al. (2013) compared Chlamydomonas photosynthetic responses for wild-type and photosystem II (PSII) D1 mutants in stationary cultures. Spaceflight had a greater negative effect on PSII fluorescence in wild-type cells and negatively impacted cell growth upon return to Earth. Soviet and Russian spaceflight experiments indicate that C. vulgaris has similar growth kinetics in space and on Earth, but the cells experience spaceflight as a stress (reviewed in Niederwieser et al., 2018). The impact of the spaceflight environment for larger scale production of algae is currently unknown. To test larger scale microalgae production, the European Space Agency (ESA) has developed a photobioreactor that pumps liquid media through a meandering path, pipe-reactor (Bretschneider et al., 2016). Gas exchange is mediated by fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) membranes that allow CO2 and O2 diffusion, while algae are continuously mixed with a peristaltic pump (Helisch et al., 2019). This photobioreactor is currently being tested on the International Space Station (ISS) for long-term growth of C. vulgaris. A significant challenge of maintaining photosynthetic productivity is regular removal of stationary cells and addition of new media to maintain photoautotrophic growth without forming excessive biofilms within the raceway. In addition, this photobioreactor experiment is not focusing on understanding genes required for growth in spaceflight conditions (Helisch et al., 2019). In yeast, competitive growth experiments in liquid culture were used to identify genes needed for survival in spaceflight conditions (Nislow et al., 2015). We are completing spaceflight experiments to determine similar gene sets for Chlamydomonas via competitive growth of mutagenized cells. Here we report results from our development of methods and experiment verification test (EVT). We describe a simple batch culture protocol using commercial FEP tissue culture bags that is adapted to the Veggie plant growth chambers on the ISS. Shortwave ultraviolet (UVC) light mutagenesis and full genome sequencing enabled the detection of new mutations in two microalgae strains. The spectrum of mutations identified suggests that UVC primarily induces DNA damage in Chlamydomonas via errors in translesion synthesis and double strand break repair. In addition, a variety of cellular information processing functions may need to be modified to adapt Chlamydomonas to this batch culture system.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Strains and Culturing Conditions Strains CC-5082 (WT) and CC-1883 (cw15) were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Resource Center. CC-5082 is a sequence-verified clone of CC-1690, which is a wild-type strain of mating type mt+ (Gallaher et al., 2015). CC-1883 is an mt– cw15 cell wall mutant, which allows transformation of exogenous DNA by vortexing with cells and glass beads (Kindle et al., 1989). Strains were maintained at room temperature (20–25°C) on agar plates with Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium (Gorman and Levine, 1965), under 50–100 μmol/m2/s continuous photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from daylight fluorescent bulbs (6500 K). To initiate liquid cultures, 1–2 mm colonies were scraped from TAP agar plate and inoculated into 50–100 mL TAP media. Traditional liquid cultures were grown with continuous light in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 100 r/min gyratory shaking. For spaceflight analogs, liquid cultures were grown with continuous light in 120 mL PermaLife cell culture bags (OriGen Biomedical, Austin, TX, United States). Liquid cultures were grown in daylight fluorescent lighting or in the Veggie Vegetable Production System at the Kennedy Space Center (Merritt Island, FL, United States) with a ratio of red (630 nm): green (525 nm): blue (450 nm) of 8:1:1 (Massa et al., 2016). The Veggie reservoir was set at the maximum distance from the LED lightcap. All lighting was 80–100 μmol/m2/s. The UVC mutagenesis dose that caused ∼10% cell survival was determined by transferring 7 mL of early-log phase culture at OD600 = 0.45 to 15 cm sterile petri plates in a sterile laminar flow hood. The petri plates were opened in a GS Gene Linker UV Chamber (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and exposed to increasing doses of UVC light from germicidal bulbs. Petri plates were closed, wrapped in aluminum foil, and agitated overnight in the dark at 50 r/min. Mutagenized cultures were plated on TAP agar plates with non-treated samples diluted 1:5 prior to plating. Colonies were grown under continuous light, counted, and normalized relative to non-mutagenized cultures. EVT Mutagenesis Colonies from TAP agar plates were scraped and suspended in 600 μL liquid TAP media and adjusted to an optical density of 1 at 600 nm using a visible light spectrophotometer (SmartSpec 3000, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). The Chlamydomonas suspension was used to inoculate TAP liquid media at a 1:250 dilution, i.e., 0.2 mL of OD600 = 1 suspension was added to 50 mL TAP media. WT was inoculated on day 1 of the experiment and cw15 was inoculated on day 2. The cultures were grown in flasks until reaching an OD600 of 0.4–0.5 on day 4. Non-mutagenized cells from the culture were sampled for whole genome sequencing by centrifuging 2 mL of the culture and freezing the cell pellet at −80°C until DNA was extracted. For each mutagenesis, 7 mL of early-log phase culture was exposed to 8 mJ of UV light. The mutagenized cells were then used to inoculate 100 mL of TAP media in a PermaLife tissue culture bag in a sterile laminar flow hood. Inoculated tissue culture bags were held at room temperature in the dark for 7 days and then transferred to the Veggie growth chamber. EVT Culture Conditions and Selection The Veggie chamber was set with the reservoir at maximum distance from the lighting (Massa et al., 2016). The 630 nm red light was set to “medium”; the 450 nm blue light was set to “low”; and the 525 nm green light was set to “on.” The bellows were closed during growth cycles, and the fan was set to “low.” The initial mutagenized cultures were grown for 7 days in Veggie. The cultures were then passaged by transferring 1 mL of culture to a bag containing fresh TAP media using a sterile syringe. The second culture was grown for 6 days and then passaged to a third tissue culture bag for 6 days of growth. During each passage, 2 mL of culture was sampled, centrifuged, and the cell pellet was frozen at −80°C until DNA was extracted. The remaining cultures were stored in a soft stowage, Cargo Transport Bag (CTB) until 36 days after the initial inoculation. For each dark-stored culture, 2 mL was sampled for DNA extraction. Growth Assays Growth curves for non-mutagenized cells were determined by sampling 1 mL of culture each day and reading the absorbance at 600 and 750 nm. Culture samples were diluted if optical density measurements were greater than 1. Cell density was counted using a hemocytometer and light microscopy. Dry biomass was determined by transferring all of the remaining culture volume into two 50 mL centrifuge tubes. The cells were centrifuged with the supernatant media removed and the cell pellets were lyophilized overnight. Dry weights were measured on an analytical balance. Biomass for each culture is the average of the two technical replicates. Whole Genome Sequencing DNA was extracted from the flash-frozen and dark-stored cell pellets as described with some minor modifications (Newman et al., 1990). Cell pellets were resuspended in 150 μL H2O on ice, and 300 μL of SDS-EB buffer (2% SDS, 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was added and vortexed. The cell suspension was then extracted with 350 μL phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1 (v:v) for 2–5 min by intermittent mixing using a vortex. The organic and aqueous phases were separated with a 5 min centrifugation at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. The aqueous phase was then extracted with 300 μL chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The RNA in the aqueous phase was digested with RNase A at room temperature for 10 min. DNA was precipitated by adding 1 mL 100% ethanol, incubating on ice for 30 min, and centrifuging for 10 min. The pellet was washed with 200 μL 70% ethanol, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and resuspended in 30 μL H2O. DNA sample integrity was evaluated with an Agilent TapeStation (Santa Clara, CA, United States), and concentration was determined with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each library, 3 μg of DNA was sheared to 350 bp average size using an S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA, United States). Barcoded TruSeq PCR-Free Low Throughput libraries were prepared for each DNA sample following the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Each sample had a unique index from Illumina TruSeq DNA CD Indexes (96 indexes/samples). The libraries were split into two pools to sequence a total of 38 samples: nine dark-stored and nine flash-frozen samples for each strain, growth cycle, and biological replicate as well as the two non-mutagenized initial cultures. Library pools were color-balanced and sequenced with paired-end 150 bp reads on the Illumina HiSeq X platform at MedGenome (Foster City, CA, United States). Read Processing and Genome Alignment The raw sequence reads were filtered using Trimmomatic v.0.38 to remove barcode and adaptor sequences in paired-end mode (Bolger et al., 2014). High quality reads were aligned to the C. reinhardtii reference genome (Merchant et al., 2007), v.5.6 from Phytozome, using BWA-mem (Li, 2013). Duplicate reads were removed using Picard MarkDuplicates, v.2.19.11 with default parameters. Reads near insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphisms were realigned using GATK v.3.8.1 RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner (McKenna et al., 2010; DePristo et al., 2011). Identifying Sequence Variants Three software packages for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indels were compared. FreeBayes v.1.2.0 (Garrison and Marth, 2012) was implemented with the pooled continuous option. LoFreq v. 2.1.3.1 used default parameters (Wilm et al., 2012), while CRISP pooled, discrete parameters were: –poolsize 5 –perms 100000 –mmq 10 –minc 3 (Bansal, 2010; Bansal et al., 2011). FreeBayes called more variants for libraries with the lowest depth giving a negative correlation between the number of mapped reads and number of variants detected. LoFreq is restricted to calling variants for single samples and not detecting variants at a population level. Consequently, CRISP was determined to be the optimal approach for variant detection. For each strain, CRISP genotyping results were filtered to remove variants with a call rate below 70% (i.e., missing data ≥ 30%) and monomorphic variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of zero. Monomorphic variants revealed non-mutated, natural variants relative to the reference genome. In addition, variants with low depth and low-quality mapped reads were removed based on CRISP assignments of “LowDepth, LowMQ10 and LowMQ20.” Finally, novel variants were scored by identifying exact matches to natural variants reported from whole genome sequencing of 39 Chlamydomonas laboratory strains (Gallaher et al., 2015). Variant density was visualized by plotting SNPs detected in windows of 100, 400, 500, and 1000 kb. A window size of 400 kb was selected visually as showing the highest resolution of natural variant SNP clusters. Determining Protein Coding Variants and Selection The effect of each variant on protein coding regions was predicted using SnpEff v.4.3t (Cingolani et al., 2012). Synonymous and non-synonymous mutations from the primary SnpEff call were used to estimate the overall impact of UVC mutagenesis on protein coding genes. Synonymous (πS) and non-synonymous (πN) nucleotide diversity was estimated for each gene using SNPGenie (Nelson et al., 2015). SNPGenie was run for all high-quality and novel variants independently, using both the forward strand and reverse complement strand. Positive selection was inferred when πN > πS, and purifying selection was inferred when πN < πS. Genes showing positive or purifying selection were tested for gene ontology (GO) term enrichment using AgriGO v2.0 with default parameters except for the “Hochberg (FDR)” multi-test adjustment method for the default false discovery rate of 0.05 (Tian et al., 2017).",
    "results": "Results We tested commercial FEP tissue culture bags for the ability to support microalgae growth without agitation or active mixing of gases with liquids. Under daylight fluorescent lighting, the bags are able to support robust growth for both cw15 and WT strains (Figures 1A–D). Time courses of growth show a 1 day delay in the bags (Figures 1E–H). Logistic growth curve regressions of optical density estimated the maximum doubling time for cw15 was 5.32 h in flasks and 8.01 h in FEP bags (Figure 1E). For WT, maximal doubling time was 7.42 h for flasks and 8.98 h for FEP bags (Figure 1F). Similar doubling times were estimated from cell counts: 5.7 versus 7.65 h for cw15 and 7.3 versus 8.73 h for WT (Figures 1G,H). Cell counts estimated a 600- to 1450-fold increase in cell number during the culture indicating 9–11 cell doublings in the batch cultures. Dry weight biomass was in rank order with the measurements of optical density and cell density at the 6 days time point. The cw15 flask cultures had the lowest biomass at 0.61 g/L, and the WT flask cultures had the highest biomass at 0.95 g/L (Figure 1I). The FEP tissue culture bags grew to a cell density in-between flask cultures for cw15 and WT. These data indicate the bags provide sufficient gas exchange to support microalgae, but that Chlamydomonas laboratory strains grow faster in flasks. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Microalgae growth in FEP plastic culture bags. (A) Flask and (B) FEP bag culture of cw15, CC-1883. (C) Flask and (D) FEP bag culture of wild-type (WT), CC-5082.

Trend lines are logistic growth curve regressions. (I) Average biomass produced after 6 days of culture. (J) Dose-response of WT algae to UVC light. Trend line is an exponential regression. Error bars in all panels are standard deviation. To identify genes required for growth in tissue culture bags, we mutagenized the strains prior to competitive growth assays. We first determined the dose-response for cell lethality in a UVC light chamber. Figure 1J shows that 6–10 mJ of UVC exposure is sufficient to kill ∼90% of WT cells. Similar results were obtained for cw15, and we concluded that 8 mJ of UVC would give sufficient DNA damage to induce mutations in both strains without risking excessive cell death and culture failure during spaceflight. An EVT was completed at the Kennedy Space Center (Figure 2). Three biological replicates of WT and cw15 were mutagenized at the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States. The mutagenized cells were transferred to tissue culture bags with TAP media and stored at room temperature in the dark for 7 days to emulate a late load and storage during a resupply mission to the ISS. The cultures were then transferred to a Veggie unit to provide light and stimulate photosynthesis. The culture bags were placed under bungee cords that hold plant pillows in the Veggie reservoir (Figure 2B). The bags were left without any agitation except during passages (Figure 2C). To complete a passage, culture bags were removed from the reservoir, agitated manually, and 1 mL of culture was transferred to fresh media for a new growth cycle (Figures 2D–F). An additional 2 mL of culture was sampled and cell pellets were frozen to preserve a DNA sample without dark storage. FIGURE 2.

(B) Initial installation of mutagenized culture bags in the Veggie reservoir. (C) Veggie chamber with algae bags and closed bellows. (D) Algae cultures prior to passage. (E,F) Passage of culture using sterile syringes. The remaining culture was stored in a closed CTB to simulate ambient storage on the ISS and return of live cultures to Earth (Figure 3A). At 36 days after the initial inoculation, all culture bags were sampled for DNA extraction and biomass assessment (Figure 3B). The WT strain showed higher biomass compared to the cw15 cell wall mutant (p = 0.01, paired Student’s t-test). Within each strain, there was a significant trend for increased biomass with additional culture passages (p < 0.01, ANOVA). However, all biomass levels were lower than immediate harvest of cells after 6 days of culture without UV mutagenesis or dark storage (Figure 1I). The biomass trends observed most likely reflect loss of biomass due to respiration during dark storage. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab (A) Storage of live algae cultures in CTB soft stowage bag. (B) Biomass yield after dark storage. Average and standard deviation of three biological replicates are plotted. Lowercase letters indicate statistically significant groups of culture passages based on ANOVA of each strain and a Tukey HSD test. Whole genome sequencing of the pre-mutagenized cultures, frozen cell pellets, and dark stored cultures was completed with an average read depth of 16x. Variants consisting of SNPs and short InDel polymorphisms were called with CRISP using pooled sample parameters (Figure 4). After removing missing data (≥30%) and monomorphic polymorphisms (MAF = 0), we detected 73,573 WT variants and 79,455 cw15 variants. Filtering to remove low-depth and low-quality reads reduced WT and cw15 polymorphic variants to 48,380 and 53,939, respectively. This represents an average of one variant per 2.24 kbp in WT and 2.01 kbp in cw15. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Sequence analysis pipeline with key parameters for variant calling and quality filtering. Plotting the variant density across the genome identified known hotspots of natural variation among laboratory strains (Figure 5, Gallaher et al., 2015). The WT strain is a sequence-verified clone of CC-1690, and the polymorphic variants identified overlapping peaks on chromosomes 2, 6, and 9. In addition, there were peaks that overlapped with other natural variants on chromosomes 3 and 12. The cw15 strain derives from a cross with CC-1690 and a similar pattern of natural variant peaks was observed. These natural variants may represent spontaneous mutations that are easily tolerated in Chlamydomonas or regions of the genome that are difficult to align with high confidence. In either case, known natural variants are likely to have little signal of selection due to induced UVC mutagenesis. We removed all exact matches to natural variants to obtain 5286 WT and 5873 cw15 novel variants, which are more evenly distributed across the genome (Figure 5). The average genomic density for the novel variants were one variant per 20.83 kbp in WT and 18.75 kbp in cw15. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Density of SNP and indel variants in the Chlamydomonas genome. The Y-axis is the number of variants per 400 kb, and the X-axis is the physical distance of each chromosome. The variant dataset plotted is labeled on the right of each panel. Variants from 39 laboratory strains (black, top panel) and CC-1690 (black, second panel) sequenced by Gallaher et al. (2015). Light and dark gray show all high quality variants (step 4 in Figure 4) in the WT and cw15 strains. Orange (WT) and green (cw15) plot novel variants after filtering identical matches to polymorphisms in the Gallaher et al. (2015) study (step 5 in Figure 4). The novel variants show a different spectrum of base changes than natural variants (Figure 6A). There is a relative decrease in transitions and an increase in transversions with the complementary mutations of A > C and T > G as well as C > G and G > C predominating. These data suggest the novel variants represent mutations caused by induced mutagenesis instead of the endogenous spectrum of Chlamydomonas variants. In addition, the novel mutations are found at a higher allele frequency indicating that the novel mutations have more sequence read support across samples than natural variants (Figure 6B). We conclude that novel variants better represent the UVC mutagenized sites. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Effects of variant filtering and live culture storage on mutations detected. (A) Relative frequency of base changes and indels for natural variants found by Gallaher et al. (2015) and the novel variants after UV mutagenesis. (B) Minor allele frequency distribution for all variants and novel variants. (C,D) Average sequencing depth of three biological replicate libraries prepared from dark stored cultures and algae pellets that were frozen at the time of passage. (E,F) Average number of novel mutations detected in libraries from dark stored and frozen tissues. Error bars are standard deviations. Centrifugation and freezing cell pellets for DNA sampling requires more extensive astronaut time and limiting resources on the ISS. We compared the mutations recovered from samples that had been frozen at the time of passage and those from live cultures that had been stored in the dark. There were no significant differences in sequencing depth based on the storage conditions (Figures 6C,D). However, dark storage decreased the number of mutations recovered in passage 1, which were cultures stored for 22 days prior to sampling (Figures 6E,F). Student’s t-tests showed a significant reduction of mutations detected for the WT strain (p = 0.003), but the reduction was non-significant for cw15 (p = 0.07). For frozen stored libraries, the number of novel mutations detected in each passage was nearly constant indicating sequencing depth was limiting for mutant detection. These results suggest that changes in allele frequency over culture passages are not a reliable indicator of selection for this experiment. To assess the effects of novel mutation on protein coding sequences, SnpEff was used to identify protein coding changes. Natural variants were enriched for synonymous mutations, while the novel variants were enriched for protein coding changes (Figure 7A). These results are consistent with an increased frequency of deleterious mutations after UV mutagenesis. Individual genes were tested for selection based on nucleotide diversity (π) using SNPGenie. Novel variants were enriched for genes showing evidence of positive selection with about 46% of genes tested having πN > πS, compared to 29% of all variants (Figure 7B). These results are consistent with the enrichment for non-synonymous mutations resulting from UV mutagenesis. FIGURE 7.

White and gray show natural variants detected. Orange and green show novel variants. (B) Average fraction of genes showing positive selection of all genes tested with SNPGenie. Averages are from six libraries per passage. Error bars are standard deviations. (C) Enriched GO terms for genes with positive selection. Based on GO term enrichment analyses, the positively selected genes in WT and cw15 both show significant enrichments for terms associated with purine nucleotide binding and hydrolase activity (Figure 7C). The individual genes with these GO terms represent information processing functions in DNA damage repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, and signal transduction (Supplementary Table S1). The WT libraries also had enrichment for terms associated with small molecule transporters with individual genes predominantly being ABC transporters. The WT strain also had significant enrichments for genes under purifying selection (Figure 8). More than half of these genes are predicted to function in regulating the levels of cyclic nucleotide second messengers suggesting that second messenger signal transduction may be under selective pressure in in the culture bag growth system. The cw15 strain had no significantly-enriched GO terms for genes under purifying selection. FIGURE 8.

    "discussion": "Discussion This EVT validated a strategy for identifying genes required by Chlamydomonas during log phase growth in spaceflight. We have shown that commercial FEP tissue culture bags can be used for batch culture of microalgae and result in 9–11 cell doublings during a 6 day culture. Cells in these cultures that divide normally will be at least 1000 fold enriched at stationary phase over cells with genetic variants that prevent mitotic division. Competition through multiple passages will eliminate mutations that prevent mitotic growth. Chlamydomonas is viable in these bags after prolonged dark storage, which enables full genome sequencing and identification of mutant genes in the culture. We have since used this strategy to grow the WT and cw15 strains during the SpaceX CRS-15 mission; analysis of the spaceflight experiment is on-going. Whole genome sequencing has been used to assess the mutagenic load of the bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, in a 2 week spaceflight exposure (Guo et al., 2015). Less than 40 SNPs were detected in the genome from spaceflight with similar numbers of SNPs detected on ground and in spaceflight. These data suggest that exogenous mutagenesis is necessary to gain adequate signal of selection in short-term competitive growth experiments. A yeast selection experiment was completed in spaceflight by using a genome-wide deletion collection (Nislow et al., 2015). The competitive growth experiment measured the reduction in representation of bar-coded mutants over the course of ∼21 mitotic generations. This type of competitive growth identifies individual genes needed for growth. By contrast, UVC mutagenesis has a higher genetic load and generates a more diverse array of allele types to compete within the culture. Moreover, three serial batch cultures of Chlamydomonas are expected to give ∼30 mitotic generations potentially giving more signal of selection within the genome sequence data. There are several limitations to the design of this competitive growth assay. The algae were grown in mixotrophic conditions with both acetate and light as sources of energy. The addition of acetate to the media promotes rapid growth of the cultures allowing up to four passages to be completed in a 1-month SpaceX commercial resupply mission. Consequently, genes under purifying selection are expected to include pathways to utilize acetate. Similarly, the Veggie growth chamber has a limited spectrum of lighting with three narrow wavelengths that do not include far-red light (Massa et al., 2016). Each wavelength has two to four light level settings, and the lighting needed to be enriched for red light to provide 80–100 μmol/m2/s of light to the culture bags. Limitations to random mutagenesis are that loss-of-function mutations in all genes are not represented in each biological replicate of the experiment and that multiple mutations are simultaneously selected in individual cells during mitotic divisions. Moreover, we found that all cultures had a high level of polymorphisms that were identical to previously described natural variants in laboratory strains (Gallaher et al., 2015). The sequencing depth and 30 mitotic generations of the experiment did not provide sufficient sensitivity to detect changes in allele frequencies of individual natural variants. Consequently, we focused on selection signatures in novel mutations that were unique to UV mutagenized cultures. Ultraviolet light causes direct DNA damage to create cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and the UV mutation signature is typically biased toward C > T transitions (Ikehata and Ono, 2011). Chlamydomonas DNA readily forms pyrimidine dimers, and WT strains have a robust dark-repair pathway to repair 90–95% of the DNA damage directly within 24 h (Small, 1987). With whole genome sequencing, we observed enrichment for T > G and C > G transversions in the mutations resulting from the UV treatment instead of the expected C > T transitions. Incorporation of several oxidative products of guanine can promote C > G transversions in response to a variety of mutagens, including UV (Kino and Sugiyama, 2005). In human cancers, C > G base changes are associated with activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases followed by error-prone translesion synthesis (Forbes et al., 2017). Human cancers also have base substitution signatures that are enriched for T > G, such as COSMIC signatures 17b and 28 (Forbes et al., 2017). However, no specific mechanisms have been proposed for the specific enrichment of T > G transversions. Intriguingly, we observed signatures of selection in DNA polymerase ζ, θ, and REV1 (Supplementary Table S1), which are associated with translesion synthesis (Sakamoto, 2019). In the human germ line, C > G mutations have been suggested to be caused by errors in double-stand break repair (Gao et al., 2019). DNA polymerase θ and DNA ligase 4 function in the non-homologous end joining double strand break repair pathway, and we found evidence of selection for both of these enzymes in the EVT (Pannunzio et al., 2018). Evidence for selection in double-strand break repair and translesion synthesis suggests that these pathways are likely relevant to the UV-induced mutations observed. The low sequence coverage of this experiment creates risk in using the frequency of recovery for specific mutant alleles in determining whether specific genes are under positive or purifying selection. The number of alleles discovered is limited by the sequencing depth, and higher coverage is necessary to increase the power of the statistics to detect selection at a genome-wide level. Nevertheless, we were able to classify 476 genes in the WT strain and 503 genes in the cw15 strain for purifying or positive selection based on mutations within coding sequences. Among these, 104 genes were enriched for molecular functions based on GO terms. In addition to DNA repair pathways, these analyses revealed signal transduction and other information processing functions including, chromatin reading, RNA processing, and translation to be enriched within selected genes. The enriched molecular functions are predicted to be processes necessary for Chlamydomonas to adapt to the UV mutagenesis, lack of media agitation, the diffusion of gases across the FEP membrane, and the lighting conditions in the Veggie unit. Scalable production of Chlamydomonas in spaceflight has multiple potential applications. The species will accumulate lipids to about 20–25% of total biomass, which can be used as an organic chemical feedstock (Becker, 2007; Xu et al., 2018). Chlamydomonas also has high protein content of 40–60% of biomass making it a potential source of food. Although it is not yet designated as a GRAS organism by the FDA, Chlamydomonas is non-toxic; animal feeding studies show no harmful effects at 4 g algae biomass per kg body weight per day, the highest consumption levels tested (Murbach et al., 2018). Equivalent consumption for a 65 kg person would be approximately 260 g of algae powder per day. As a genetic model organism, Chlamydomonas biomass composition can be further modified by mutagenesis or targeted gene editing. For example, starch over-accumulation mutants have been isolated that shift starch content from 15 to 30–35% of biomass (Koo et al., 2017). Likewise, CRISPR gene editing of the Chlamydomonas zeaxanthin epoxidase gene significantly increases carotenoids needed to prevent macular degeneration (Baek et al., 2018). The modified algae strain was used to supplement chicken feed to increase the zeaxanthin content of eggs. The myriad of potential applications for microalgae production in spaceflight justify direct investigation of the genes needed for liquid culture production. Our current study shows both feasibility for a spaceflight experiment and identifies a series of cellular information processing genes that are likely required for Chlamydomonas to adapt to batch culture in breathable plastic bags.",

Copyright notice ID: 7261848 PMID: 32523594 Abstract A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains at the start of the assay. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These data suggest that modification of DNA repair, signal transduction, and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this spaceflight production system. Keywords: algae, space environment, genetic fitness, population genetics, Chlamydomonas reinhardtiiIntroduction Microalgae grow by converting light, water, and CO2 into biomass. Algae have long been proposed for space life support systems to recycle CO2 and provide food either directly or indirectly to astronauts (Brechignac and Schiller, 1992; Ai et al., 2008; Niederwieser et al., 2018; Matula and Nabity, 2019). Many species of microalgae are photosynthetically efficient under the limiting light and low volume conditions necessary in space production (Kliphuis et al., 2012). As single cell organisms, microalgae are easy to cultivate with minimal requirements, and have great potential to yield value-added products. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, such as Chlorella vulgaris and Arthrospira platensis, respectively, are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) for human consumption (Caporgno and Mathys, 2018). Algae have nutritional benefits with high levels of antioxidants and protein with essential amino acids (Buono et al., 2014). Algae are also rich in ω-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (Salem and Eggersdorfer, 2015). The red algal carotenoid, astaxanthin, has multiple uses including the ability to protect against retinal damage in animals (Wang et al., 2000; Katagiri et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2016; Otsuka et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2016). Algal oils may be used in future astronaut diets to help mitigate harmful effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation during spaceflight. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model organism for unicellular algae with a well-annotated genome sequence (Merchant et al., 2007). Although Chlamydomonas is not designated as a GRAS organism, feeding studies show no harmful effects of including significant amounts of algae biomass in animal feed (Baek et al., 2018; Murbach et al., 2018). Consequently, Chlamydomonas can be used as a model for other microalgae species, an animal feed for space food systems, or a feedstock for manufacturing. A few past studies exposed or grew algal species in space conditions (Mergenhagen and Mergenhagen, 1989; Wang et al., 2006; Giardi et al., 2013; Niederwieser et al., 2018). A Space Shuttle mission in 1985 used C. reinhardtii to examine phototaxic responses in microgravity (Mergenhagen and Mergenhagen, 1989). Microgravity allowed cells to remain close to light sources in spaceflight suggesting that photosynthetic productivity could be higher in space. By contrast, Wang et al. (2006) grew cyanobacteria for 15 days in a satellite and found reduced growth relative to a ground control. However, the ground control temperature and light cycles were not adjusted to the space conditions. The satellite had two temperature drops and two missed day photoperiods preventing strong conclusions from being drawn about growth rates. Giardi et al. (2013) compared Chlamydomonas photosynthetic responses for wild-type and photosystem II (PSII) D1 mutants in stationary cultures. Spaceflight had a greater negative effect on PSII fluorescence in wild-type cells and negatively impacted cell growth upon return to Earth. Soviet and Russian spaceflight experiments indicate that C. vulgaris has similar growth kinetics in space and on Earth, but the cells experience spaceflight as a stress (reviewed in Niederwieser et al., 2018). The impact of the spaceflight environment for larger scale production of algae is currently unknown. To test larger scale microalgae production, the European Space Agency (ESA) has developed a photobioreactor that pumps liquid media through a meandering path, pipe-reactor (Bretschneider et al., 2016). Gas exchange is mediated by fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) membranes that allow CO2 and O2 diffusion, while algae are continuously mixed with a peristaltic pump (Helisch et al., 2019). This photobioreactor is currently being tested on the International Space Station (ISS) for long-term growth of C. vulgaris. A significant challenge of maintaining photosynthetic productivity is regular removal of stationary cells and addition of new media to maintain photoautotrophic growth without forming excessive biofilms within the raceway. In addition, this photobioreactor experiment is not focusing on understanding genes required for growth in spaceflight conditions (Helisch et al., 2019). In yeast, competitive growth experiments in liquid culture were used to identify genes needed for survival in spaceflight conditions (Nislow et al., 2015). We are completing spaceflight experiments to determine similar gene sets for Chlamydomonas via competitive growth of mutagenized cells. Here we report results from our development of methods and experiment verification test (EVT). We describe a simple batch culture protocol using commercial FEP tissue culture bags that is adapted to the Veggie plant growth chambers on the ISS. Shortwave ultraviolet (UVC) light mutagenesis and full genome sequencing enabled the detection of new mutations in two microalgae strains. The spectrum of mutations identified suggests that UVC primarily induces DNA damage in Chlamydomonas via errors in translesion synthesis and double strand break repair. In addition, a variety of cellular information processing functions may need to be modified to adapt Chlamydomonas to this batch culture system.Materials and Methods Strains and Culturing Conditions Strains CC-5082 (WT) and CC-1883 (cw15) were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Resource Center. CC-5082 is a sequence-verified clone of CC-1690, which is a wild-type strain of mating type mt+ (Gallaher et al., 2015). CC-1883 is an mt– cw15 cell wall mutant, which allows transformation of exogenous DNA by vortexing with cells and glass beads (Kindle et al., 1989). Strains were maintained at room temperature (20–25°C) on agar plates with Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium (Gorman and Levine, 1965), under 50–100 μmol/m2/s continuous photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from daylight fluorescent bulbs (6500 K). To initiate liquid cultures, 1–2 mm colonies were scraped from TAP agar plate and inoculated into 50–100 mL TAP media. Traditional liquid cultures were grown with continuous light in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 100 r/min gyratory shaking. For spaceflight analogs, liquid cultures were grown with continuous light in 120 mL PermaLife cell culture bags (OriGen Biomedical, Austin, TX, United States). Liquid cultures were grown in daylight fluorescent lighting or in the Veggie Vegetable Production System at the Kennedy Space Center (Merritt Island, FL, United States) with a ratio of red (630 nm): green (525 nm): blue (450 nm) of 8:1:1 (Massa et al., 2016). The Veggie reservoir was set at the maximum distance from the LED lightcap. All lighting was 80–100 μmol/m2/s. The UVC mutagenesis dose that caused ∼10% cell survival was determined by transferring 7 mL of early-log phase culture at OD600 = 0.45 to 15 cm sterile petri plates in a sterile laminar flow hood. The petri plates were opened in a GS Gene Linker UV Chamber (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and exposed to increasing doses of UVC light from germicidal bulbs. Petri plates were closed, wrapped in aluminum foil, and agitated overnight in the dark at 50 r/min. Mutagenized cultures were plated on TAP agar plates with non-treated samples diluted 1:5 prior to plating. Colonies were grown under continuous light, counted, and normalized relative to non-mutagenized cultures.EVT Mutagenesis Colonies from TAP agar plates were scraped and suspended in 600 μL liquid TAP media and adjusted to an optical density of 1 at 600 nm using a visible light spectrophotometer (SmartSpec 3000, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). The Chlamydomonas suspension was used to inoculate TAP liquid media at a 1:250 dilution, i.e., 0.2 mL of OD600 = 1 suspension was added to 50 mL TAP media. WT was inoculated on day 1 of the experiment and cw15 was inoculated on day 2. The cultures were grown in flasks until reaching an OD600 of 0.4–0.5 on day 4. Non-mutagenized cells from the culture were sampled for whole genome sequencing by centrifuging 2 mL of the culture and freezing the cell pellet at −80°C until DNA was extracted. For each mutagenesis, 7 mL of early-log phase culture was exposed to 8 mJ of UV light. The mutagenized cells were then used to inoculate 100 mL of TAP media in a PermaLife tissue culture bag in a sterile laminar flow hood. Inoculated tissue culture bags were held at room temperature in the dark for 7 days and then transferred to the Veggie growth chamber.EVT Culture Conditions and Selection The Veggie chamber was set with the reservoir at maximum distance from the lighting (Massa et al., 2016). The 630 nm red light was set to “medium”; the 450 nm blue light was set to “low”; and the 525 nm green light was set to “on.” The bellows were closed during growth cycles, and the fan was set to “low.” The initial mutagenized cultures were grown for 7 days in Veggie. The cultures were then passaged by transferring 1 mL of culture to a bag containing fresh TAP media using a sterile syringe. The second culture was grown for 6 days and then passaged to a third tissue culture bag for 6 days of growth. During each passage, 2 mL of culture was sampled, centrifuged, and the cell pellet was frozen at −80°C until DNA was extracted. The remaining cultures were stored in a soft stowage, Cargo Transport Bag (CTB) until 36 days after the initial inoculation. For each dark-stored culture, 2 mL was sampled for DNA extraction.Growth Assays Growth curves for non-mutagenized cells were determined by sampling 1 mL of culture each day and reading the absorbance at 600 and 750 nm. Culture samples were diluted if optical density measurements were greater than 1. Cell density was counted using a hemocytometer and light microscopy. Dry biomass was determined by transferring all of the remaining culture volume into two 50 mL centrifuge tubes. The cells were centrifuged with the supernatant media removed and the cell pellets were lyophilized overnight. Dry weights were measured on an analytical balance. Biomass for each culture is the average of the two technical replicates.Whole Genome Sequencing DNA was extracted from the flash-frozen and dark-stored cell pellets as described with some minor modifications (Newman et al., 1990). Cell pellets were resuspended in 150 μL H2O on ice, and 300 μL of SDS-EB buffer (2% SDS, 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was added and vortexed. The cell suspension was then extracted with 350 μL phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1 (v:v) for 2–5 min by intermittent mixing using a vortex. The organic and aqueous phases were separated with a 5 min centrifugation at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. The aqueous phase was then extracted with 300 μL chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The RNA in the aqueous phase was digested with RNase A at room temperature for 10 min. DNA was precipitated by adding 1 mL 100% ethanol, incubating on ice for 30 min, and centrifuging for 10 min. The pellet was washed with 200 μL 70% ethanol, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and resuspended in 30 μL H2O. DNA sample integrity was evaluated with an Agilent TapeStation (Santa Clara, CA, United States), and concentration was determined with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each library, 3 μg of DNA was sheared to 350 bp average size using an S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA, United States). Barcoded TruSeq PCR-Free Low Throughput libraries were prepared for each DNA sample following the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Each sample had a unique index from Illumina TruSeq DNA CD Indexes (96 indexes/samples). The libraries were split into two pools to sequence a total of 38 samples: nine dark-stored and nine flash-frozen samples for each strain, growth cycle, and biological replicate as well as the two non-mutagenized initial cultures. Library pools were color-balanced and sequenced with paired-end 150 bp reads on the Illumina HiSeq X platform at MedGenome (Foster City, CA, United States).Read Processing and Genome Alignment The raw sequence reads were filtered using Trimmomatic v.0.38 to remove barcode and adaptor sequences in paired-end mode (Bolger et al., 2014). High quality reads were aligned to the C. reinhardtii reference genome (Merchant et al., 2007), v.5.6 from Phytozome, using BWA-mem (Li, 2013). Duplicate reads were removed using Picard MarkDuplicates, v.2.19.11 with default parameters. Reads near insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphisms were realigned using GATK v.3.8.1 RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner (McKenna et al., 2010; DePristo et al., 2011).Identifying Sequence Variants Three software packages for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indels were compared. FreeBayes v.1.2.0 (Garrison and Marth, 2012) was implemented with the pooled continuous option. LoFreq v. 2.1.3.1 used default parameters (Wilm et al., 2012), while CRISP pooled, discrete parameters were: –poolsize 5 –perms 100000 –mmq 10 –minc 3 (Bansal, 2010; Bansal et al., 2011). FreeBayes called more variants for libraries with the lowest depth giving a negative correlation between the number of mapped reads and number of variants detected. LoFreq is restricted to calling variants for single samples and not detecting variants at a population level. Consequently, CRISP was determined to be the optimal approach for variant detection. For each strain, CRISP genotyping results were filtered to remove variants with a call rate below 70% (i.e., missing data ≥ 30%) and monomorphic variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of zero. Monomorphic variants revealed non-mutated, natural variants relative to the reference genome. In addition, variants with low depth and low-quality mapped reads were removed based on CRISP assignments of “LowDepth, LowMQ10 and LowMQ20.” Finally, novel variants were scored by identifying exact matches to natural variants reported from whole genome sequencing of 39 Chlamydomonas laboratory strains (Gallaher et al., 2015). Variant density was visualized by plotting SNPs detected in windows of 100, 400, 500, and 1000 kb. A window size of 400 kb was selected visually as showing the highest resolution of natural variant SNP clusters.Determining Protein Coding Variants and Selection The effect of each variant on protein coding regions was predicted using SnpEff v.4.3t (Cingolani et al., 2012). Synonymous and non-synonymous mutations from the primary SnpEff call were used to estimate the overall impact of UVC mutagenesis on protein coding genes. Synonymous (πS) and non-synonymous (πN) nucleotide diversity was estimated for each gene using SNPGenie (Nelson et al., 2015). SNPGenie was run for all high-quality and novel variants independently, using both the forward strand and reverse complement strand. Positive selection was inferred when πN > πS, and purifying selection was inferred when πN < πS. Genes showing positive or purifying selection were tested for gene ontology (GO) term enrichment using AgriGO v2.0 with default parameters except for the “Hochberg (FDR)” multi-test adjustment method for the default false discovery rate of 0.05 (Tian et al., 2017).Results We tested commercial FEP tissue culture bags for the ability to support microalgae growth without agitation or active mixing of gases with liquids. Under daylight fluorescent lighting, the bags are able to support robust growth for both cw15 and WT strains (Figures 1A–D). Time courses of growth show a 1 day delay in the bags (Figures 1E–H). Logistic growth curve regressions of optical density estimated the maximum doubling time for cw15 was 5.32 h in flasks and 8.01 h in FEP bags (Figure 1E). For WT, maximal doubling time was 7.42 h for flasks and 8.98 h for FEP bags (Figure 1F). Similar doubling times were estimated from cell counts: 5.7 versus 7.65 h for cw15 and 7.3 versus 8.73 h for WT (Figures 1G,H). Cell counts estimated a 600- to 1450-fold increase in cell number during the culture indicating 9–11 cell doublings in the batch cultures. Dry weight biomass was in rank order with the measurements of optical density and cell density at the 6 days time point. The cw15 flask cultures had the lowest biomass at 0.61 g/L, and the WT flask cultures had the highest biomass at 0.95 g/L (Figure 1I). The FEP tissue culture bags grew to a cell density in-between flask cultures for cw15 and WT. These data indicate the bags provide sufficient gas exchange to support microalgae, but that Chlamydomonas laboratory strains grow faster in flasks. FIGURE 1.

Trend lines are logistic growth curve regressions. (I) Average biomass produced after 6 days of culture. (J) Dose-response of WT algae to UVC light. Trend line is an exponential regression. Error bars in all panels are standard deviation.To identify genes required for growth in tissue culture bags, we mutagenized the strains prior to competitive growth assays. We first determined the dose-response for cell lethality in a UVC light chamber. Figure 1J shows that 6–10 mJ of UVC exposure is sufficient to kill ∼90% of WT cells. Similar results were obtained for cw15, and we concluded that 8 mJ of UVC would give sufficient DNA damage to induce mutations in both strains without risking excessive cell death and culture failure during spaceflight. An EVT was completed at the Kennedy Space Center (Figure 2). Three biological replicates of WT and cw15 were mutagenized at the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States. The mutagenized cells were transferred to tissue culture bags with TAP media and stored at room temperature in the dark for 7 days to emulate a late load and storage during a resupply mission to the ISS. The cultures were then transferred to a Veggie unit to provide light and stimulate photosynthesis. The culture bags were placed under bungee cords that hold plant pillows in the Veggie reservoir (Figure 2B). The bags were left without any agitation except during passages (Figure 2C). To complete a passage, culture bags were removed from the reservoir, agitated manually, and 1 mL of culture was transferred to fresh media for a new growth cycle (Figures 2D–F). An additional 2 mL of culture was sampled and cell pellets were frozen to preserve a DNA sample without dark storage. FIGURE 2.

(E,F) Passage of culture using sterile syringes.The remaining culture was stored in a closed CTB to simulate ambient storage on the ISS and return of live cultures to Earth (Figure 3A). At 36 days after the initial inoculation, all culture bags were sampled for DNA extraction and biomass assessment (Figure 3B). The WT strain showed higher biomass compared to the cw15 cell wall mutant (p = 0.01, paired Student’s t-test). Within each strain, there was a significant trend for increased biomass with additional culture passages (p < 0.01, ANOVA). However, all biomass levels were lower than immediate harvest of cells after 6 days of culture without UV mutagenesis or dark storage (Figure 1I). The biomass trends observed most likely reflect loss of biomass due to respiration during dark storage. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab (A) Storage of live algae cultures in CTB soft stowage bag. (B) Biomass yield after dark storage. Average and standard deviation of three biological replicates are plotted. Lowercase letters indicate statistically significant groups of culture passages based on ANOVA of each strain and a Tukey HSD test.Whole genome sequencing of the pre-mutagenized cultures, frozen cell pellets, and dark stored cultures was completed with an average read depth of 16x. Variants consisting of SNPs and short InDel polymorphisms were called with CRISP using pooled sample parameters (Figure 4). After removing missing data (≥30%) and monomorphic polymorphisms (MAF = 0), we detected 73,573 WT variants and 79,455 cw15 variants. Filtering to remove low-depth and low-quality reads reduced WT and cw15 polymorphic variants to 48,380 and 53,939, respectively. This represents an average of one variant per 2.24 kbp in WT and 2.01 kbp in cw15. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Sequence analysis pipeline with key parameters for variant calling and quality filtering.Plotting the variant density across the genome identified known hotspots of natural variation among laboratory strains (Figure 5, Gallaher et al., 2015). The WT strain is a sequence-verified clone of CC-1690, and the polymorphic variants identified overlapping peaks on chromosomes 2, 6, and 9. In addition, there were peaks that overlapped with other natural variants on chromosomes 3 and 12. The cw15 strain derives from a cross with CC-1690 and a similar pattern of natural variant peaks was observed. These natural variants may represent spontaneous mutations that are easily tolerated in Chlamydomonas or regions of the genome that are difficult to align with high confidence. In either case, known natural variants are likely to have little signal of selection due to induced UVC mutagenesis. We removed all exact matches to natural variants to obtain 5286 WT and 5873 cw15 novel variants, which are more evenly distributed across the genome (Figure 5). The average genomic density for the novel variants were one variant per 20.83 kbp in WT and 18.75 kbp in cw15. FIGURE 5.

The variant dataset plotted is labeled on the right of each panel. Variants from 39 laboratory strains (black, top panel) and CC-1690 (black, second panel) sequenced by Gallaher et al. (2015). Light and dark gray show all high quality variants (step 4 in Figure 4) in the WT and cw15 strains. Orange (WT) and green (cw15) plot novel variants after filtering identical matches to polymorphisms in the Gallaher et al. (2015) study (step 5 in Figure 4).The novel variants show a different spectrum of base changes than natural variants (Figure 6A). There is a relative decrease in transitions and an increase in transversions with the complementary mutations of A > C and T > G as well as C > G and G > C predominating. These data suggest the novel variants represent mutations caused by induced mutagenesis instead of the endogenous spectrum of Chlamydomonas variants. In addition, the novel mutations are found at a higher allele frequency indicating that the novel mutations have more sequence read support across samples than natural variants (Figure 6B). We conclude that novel variants better represent the UVC mutagenized sites. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Effects of variant filtering and live culture storage on mutations detected.

(B) Minor allele frequency distribution for all variants and novel variants. (C,D) Average sequencing depth of three biological replicate libraries prepared from dark stored cultures and algae pellets that were frozen at the time of passage. (E,F) Average number of novel mutations detected in libraries from dark stored and frozen tissues. Error bars are standard deviations.Centrifugation and freezing cell pellets for DNA sampling requires more extensive astronaut time and limiting resources on the ISS. We compared the mutations recovered from samples that had been frozen at the time of passage and those from live cultures that had been stored in the dark. There were no significant differences in sequencing depth based on the storage conditions (Figures 6C,D). However, dark storage decreased the number of mutations recovered in passage 1, which were cultures stored for 22 days prior to sampling (Figures 6E,F). Student’s t-tests showed a significant reduction of mutations detected for the WT strain (p = 0.003), but the reduction was non-significant for cw15 (p = 0.07). For frozen stored libraries, the number of novel mutations detected in each passage was nearly constant indicating sequencing depth was limiting for mutant detection. These results suggest that changes in allele frequency over culture passages are not a reliable indicator of selection for this experiment. To assess the effects of novel mutation on protein coding sequences, SnpEff was used to identify protein coding changes. Natural variants were enriched for synonymous mutations, while the novel variants were enriched for protein coding changes (Figure 7A). These results are consistent with an increased frequency of deleterious mutations after UV mutagenesis. Individual genes were tested for selection based on nucleotide diversity (π) using SNPGenie. Novel variants were enriched for genes showing evidence of positive selection with about 46% of genes tested having πN > πS, compared to 29% of all variants (Figure 7B). These results are consistent with the enrichment for non-synonymous mutations resulting from UV mutagenesis. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Novel variants are enriched for predicted protein coding changes. (A) Ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous variants based on SnpEff annotations. White and gray show natural variants detected. Orange and green show novel variants. (B) Average fraction of genes showing positive selection of all genes tested with SNPGenie. Averages are from six libraries per passage. Error bars are standard deviations. (C) Enriched GO terms for genes with positive selection.Based on GO term enrichment analyses, the positively selected genes in WT and cw15 both show significant enrichments for terms associated with purine nucleotide binding and hydrolase activity (Figure 7C). The individual genes with these GO terms represent information processing functions in DNA damage repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, and signal transduction (Supplementary Table S1). The WT libraries also had enrichment for terms associated with small molecule transporters with individual genes predominantly being ABC transporters. The WT strain also had significant enrichments for genes under purifying selection (Figure 8). More than half of these genes are predicted to function in regulating the levels of cyclic nucleotide second messengers suggesting that second messenger signal transduction may be under selective pressure in in the culture bag growth system. The cw15 strain had no significantly-enriched GO terms for genes under purifying selection. FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab Enriched GO terms for genes showing evidence of purifying selection in the WT strain.Discussion This EVT validated a strategy for identifying genes required by Chlamydomonas during log phase growth in spaceflight. We have shown that commercial FEP tissue culture bags can be used for batch culture of microalgae and result in 9–11 cell doublings during a 6 day culture. Cells in these cultures that divide normally will be at least 1000 fold enriched at stationary phase over cells with genetic variants that prevent mitotic division. Competition through multiple passages will eliminate mutations that prevent mitotic growth. Chlamydomonas is viable in these bags after prolonged dark storage, which enables full genome sequencing and identification of mutant genes in the culture. We have since used this strategy to grow the WT and cw15 strains during the SpaceX CRS-15 mission; analysis of the spaceflight experiment is on-going. Whole genome sequencing has been used to assess the mutagenic load of the bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, in a 2 week spaceflight exposure (Guo et al., 2015). Less than 40 SNPs were detected in the genome from spaceflight with similar numbers of SNPs detected on ground and in spaceflight. These data suggest that exogenous mutagenesis is necessary to gain adequate signal of selection in short-term competitive growth experiments. A yeast selection experiment was completed in spaceflight by using a genome-wide deletion collection (Nislow et al., 2015). The competitive growth experiment measured the reduction in representation of bar-coded mutants over the course of ∼21 mitotic generations. This type of competitive growth identifies individual genes needed for growth. By contrast, UVC mutagenesis has a higher genetic load and generates a more diverse array of allele types to compete within the culture. Moreover, three serial batch cultures of Chlamydomonas are expected to give ∼30 mitotic generations potentially giving more signal of selection within the genome sequence data. There are several limitations to the design of this competitive growth assay. The algae were grown in mixotrophic conditions with both acetate and light as sources of energy. The addition of acetate to the media promotes rapid growth of the cultures allowing up to four passages to be completed in a 1-month SpaceX commercial resupply mission. Consequently, genes under purifying selection are expected to include pathways to utilize acetate. Similarly, the Veggie growth chamber has a limited spectrum of lighting with three narrow wavelengths that do not include far-red light (Massa et al., 2016). Each wavelength has two to four light level settings, and the lighting needed to be enriched for red light to provide 80–100 μmol/m2/s of light to the culture bags. Limitations to random mutagenesis are that loss-of-function mutations in all genes are not represented in each biological replicate of the experiment and that multiple mutations are simultaneously selected in individual cells during mitotic divisions. Moreover, we found that all cultures had a high level of polymorphisms that were identical to previously described natural variants in laboratory strains (Gallaher et al., 2015). The sequencing depth and 30 mitotic generations of the experiment did not provide sufficient sensitivity to detect changes in allele frequencies of individual natural variants. Consequently, we focused on selection signatures in novel mutations that were unique to UV mutagenized cultures. Ultraviolet light causes direct DNA damage to create cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and the UV mutation signature is typically biased toward C > T transitions (Ikehata and Ono, 2011). Chlamydomonas DNA readily forms pyrimidine dimers, and WT strains have a robust dark-repair pathway to repair 90–95% of the DNA damage directly within 24 h (Small, 1987). With whole genome sequencing, we observed enrichment for T > G and C > G transversions in the mutations resulting from the UV treatment instead of the expected C > T transitions. Incorporation of several oxidative products of guanine can promote C > G transversions in response to a variety of mutagens, including UV (Kino and Sugiyama, 2005). In human cancers, C > G base changes are associated with activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases followed by error-prone translesion synthesis (Forbes et al., 2017). Human cancers also have base substitution signatures that are enriched for T > G, such as COSMIC signatures 17b and 28 (Forbes et al., 2017). However, no specific mechanisms have been proposed for the specific enrichment of T > G transversions. Intriguingly, we observed signatures of selection in DNA polymerase ζ, θ, and REV1 (Supplementary Table S1), which are associated with translesion synthesis (Sakamoto, 2019). In the human germ line, C > G mutations have been suggested to be caused by errors in double-stand break repair (Gao et al., 2019). DNA polymerase θ and DNA ligase 4 function in the non-homologous end joining double strand break repair pathway, and we found evidence of selection for both of these enzymes in the EVT (Pannunzio et al., 2018). Evidence for selection in double-strand break repair and translesion synthesis suggests that these pathways are likely relevant to the UV-induced mutations observed. The low sequence coverage of this experiment creates risk in using the frequency of recovery for specific mutant alleles in determining whether specific genes are under positive or purifying selection. The number of alleles discovered is limited by the sequencing depth, and higher coverage is necessary to increase the power of the statistics to detect selection at a genome-wide level. Nevertheless, we were able to classify 476 genes in the WT strain and 503 genes in the cw15 strain for purifying or positive selection based on mutations within coding sequences. Among these, 104 genes were enriched for molecular functions based on GO terms. In addition to DNA repair pathways, these analyses revealed signal transduction and other information processing functions including, chromatin reading, RNA processing, and translation to be enriched within selected genes. The enriched molecular functions are predicted to be processes necessary for Chlamydomonas to adapt to the UV mutagenesis, lack of media agitation, the diffusion of gases across the FEP membrane, and the lighting conditions in the Veggie unit. Scalable production of Chlamydomonas in spaceflight has multiple potential applications. The species will accumulate lipids to about 20–25% of total biomass, which can be used as an organic chemical feedstock (Becker, 2007; Xu et al., 2018). Chlamydomonas also has high protein content of 40–60% of biomass making it a potential source of food. Although it is not yet designated as a GRAS organism by the FDA, Chlamydomonas is non-toxic; animal feeding studies show no harmful effects at 4 g algae biomass per kg body weight per day, the highest consumption levels tested (Murbach et al., 2018). Equivalent consumption for a 65 kg person would be approximately 260 g of algae powder per day. As a genetic model organism, Chlamydomonas biomass composition can be further modified by mutagenesis or targeted gene editing. For example, starch over-accumulation mutants have been isolated that shift starch content from 15 to 30–35% of biomass (Koo et al., 2017). Likewise, CRISPR gene editing of the Chlamydomonas zeaxanthin epoxidase gene significantly increases carotenoids needed to prevent macular degeneration (Baek et al., 2018). The modified algae strain was used to supplement chicken feed to increase the zeaxanthin content of eggs. The myriad of potential applications for microalgae production in spaceflight justify direct investigation of the genes needed for liquid culture production. Our current study shows both feasibility for a spaceflight experiment and identifies a series of cellular information processing genes that are likely required for Chlamydomonas to adapt to batch culture in breathable plastic bags.Data Availability Statement The whole-genome sequences generated for this study can be found in the GeneLab database https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-265/.Author Contributions JZ, BR, KT, HH, FB, and AS developed and performed the batch culture and mutagenesis.

    "abstract": "Abstract The establishment of steady-state continuous crop production during long-term deep space missions is critical for providing consistent nutritional and psychological benefits for the crew, potentially improving their health and performance. Three technology demonstrations were completed achieving simultaneous multi-species plant growth and the concurrent use of two Veggie units on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapa var japonica); and green leaf lettuce, (Lactuca sativa cv. Waldmann’s) and associated rooting pillow components and Veggie chamber surfaces. Culture based enumeration and pathogen screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. Surface samples of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick. This work provides valuable information for food production-related research on the ISS and the impact of the plant microbiome on this unique closed environment.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Future space missions and habitats will likely include crop production systems designed to provide a fresh, nutritious component to the crew diet. Understanding the complexities of plant growth systems designed with the unique challenges of space exploration missions and the associated plant microbiome is essential for sustaining the health of crop systems as well as the human consumer [1,2]. Molecular biology methods to characterize whole microbial communities through omics approaches have led to the understanding of organism and habitat-specific microbiomes. Plants and their associated microbiota exist in a complex association with important functions critical to plant growth and health. Microbes are recruited and assembled on or in plant tissues and organs from reservoirs such as the soil, rhizosphere, and phyllosphere [3,4,5,6]. Soil microbial communities are highly diverse and are horizontally transferred to the root where, at the rhizosphere, a dynamic and complex ecosystem develops [7,8,9,10,11,12]. Initial soil microbiome composition can influence plant pathogen interaction and disease resistance [13]. A plant’s phyllosphere hosts a diverse community of microbes that can also influence plant health and physiology [14,15,16,17]. Plant colonizing microorganisms are affected not only by abiotic environmental conditions such as CO2 concentration, temperature, spectral radiation, and humidity, but specific host leaf surface characteristics [14,18,19]. Studies have shown inter-plant species variability in the phyllosphere microbiome [14,16,20] and microbial colonization of the phylloplane is dependent on transmission of organisms from the environment such as aerosols, soils or other plant growth medium, and animal contact [21,22,23,24]. Conversely, it has been demonstrated that plants can influence the microbiome of the indoor built environment significantly contributing to the bacterial and fungal abundance and diversity on the surrounding surfaces [23]. The International Space Station (ISS) is an inimitable, closed environment that has been continuously inhabited by astronauts starting with Expedition 1 in November of 2000. Unlike terrestrial, built environments, the exchange of microbes from outside the ISS is infrequent and primarily limited to the exchange of international crews after months of residency on the space station, along with re-supply missions. Since 2014, plants, primarily leafy greens, have been grown in the NASA Veggie hardware which are small growth chambers on the ISS (ORBITEC now Sierra Space., Madison, WI, United States) [25,26]. Fifteen technology demonstrations directed by NASA to grow a variety of crops have been completed to date and currently there are two Veggie units (Serial number (SN) 001 and Serial number 002) in operation on ISS. The Veggie chambers (Figure 1) utilize a fan to circulate the air from outside of the chamber throughout the plant growth area facilitating an exchange of airborne microbes between the ISS atmosphere and the chamber interior. Air drawn from the ISS cabin flows from the bottom of the plant canopy to the top of the growth chamber volume. Air filtration is not present apart from screens to filter out large particles within the Veggie facility before entering the cabin [27]. Environmental conditions in which ISS grown crops have been cultivated are unlike terrestrial counterparts, in addition to an absence of gravity and natural convection. Carbon dioxide levels can reach approximately 7 to 10 times higher than ambient earth atmosphere in the closed atmosphere of the ISS, temperatures are typically between 18 °C and 23 °C and humidity is low (40–50%), however temperature and humidity can be higher inside the Veggie chamber. A collapsible, transparent bellows contains the plant growing area and any plant debris. During the on-orbit operation, the plant crops are tended, harvested, and consumed by the crew and are intended to provide a nutritional supplement to their diet. At the completion of a harvest, all plant growth containers, known as plant pillows, are discarded, or stored frozen for return to Earth and the bellows and other surfaces are cleaned with disinfectant wipes in preparation for the next crop. Figure 1. Open in a new tab (A) VEG-03D (SN 002) with ambient light and bellows down. (B) VEG-03E (SN 001) with bellows lowered and plant base plate raised to a more vertical position and VEG-03F (SN 002) partially visible on the right of VEG-03E with bellows raised. Microbial analyses using culture-based and culture-independent methods of Veggie-grown crops and growth chamber components have been completed to provide baseline data to ensure the microbiological safety for consumption by the astronauts. Subsequently, an in-depth characterization of bacterial and fungal communities associated with three crop grow-outs of red romaine lettuce that may impact astronaut and plant health has been reported [28]. Plants grown in Veggie are susceptible to abiotic factors inherent in microgravity plant cultivation such as water stress and humidity control. Without careful control and monitoring, the environmental conditions within Veggie can promote undesirable levels of microbial growth. Zinnia hybrida, a flowering plant grown in Veggie in 2015–2016 became infected with the plant opportunistic pathogen Fusarium oxysporum after failure of the ventilation system led to an increase in humidity inside the chamber [29]. The source of the fungus was not determined definitively, however F. oxysporum has been isolated on surfaces on the ISS [29,30,31,32,33]. Furthermore, F. oxysporum was among the fungal isolates identified from leaves and roots from two out of three Veggie demonstrations growing red romaine lettuce [28]. The introduction of microbes from the air, water, or human interaction onto the plant surfaces of an edible crop potentially establishes a risk to the consumer. Crew safety and health is of paramount consideration when supplying a fresh food source through Veggie crop production and the characterization of the microbial communities in Veggie furthers the assurance that these crops are appropriate and safe for human consumption. The VEG-03D, E, and F series of technology demonstrations discussed in this work are the first mixed crop use of the Veggie facility with the growth of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapa var japonica); and green leaf lettuce, (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Waldmann’s Green’). In addition to the demonstration of a mixed cultivar approach and continuous harvest using two Veggie systems, the objective of this study was to characterize and compare the bioburden and composition of the microbial communities within the Veggie plant growth units at different locations including above ground plant tissues, roots of 3 plant cultivars, Veggie facility surfaces, and plant pillow materials. We identified through culture- based and culture-independent methods dominant and shared genera of bacteria and fungi in plants, growth substrate, and Veggie facility surfaces. This study demonstrated simultaneous multi-species leafy green growth and the influence of the plant leaf and root associated microbial communities across plant species and Veggie growth chamber components.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods The VEG-03D, VEG-03E, and VEG-03F technical demonstrations aboard ISS present a mixed, multi-crop study with the inclusion of a “cut-and-come-again” component where plants were partially harvested and then re-grown to yield more produce for a given the amount of resources and to determine effects on the harvest. A total of four harvests were conducted for each grow-out, with the second and half of the fourth/final harvest preserved for later microbial analysis, and the remaining harvests consumed by astronauts. The leafy greens included were red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapa var japonica); and green leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Waldmann’s Green’). Three separate grow-outs were conducted in the two Veggie production systems on ISS with initiation in September 2017 (VEG-03D) and February 2018 (VEG-03E and F). VEG-03E and F were grown three days apart in different Veggie units to test the concept of sustainable cultivation and continuous harvest for provision of fresh produce (Table 1). Table 1. Technical demonstration scheduling for VEG-03D, VEG-03E, and VEG-03F grown aboard ISS.

Seed Preparation Seeds for each crop were surface sanitized using a chlorine gas fuming method as described by Massa et al. [34]. Briefly, seeds were batch sanitized by adding 0.5 mL HCL to 30 mL bleach in a 250 mL container by placing an open Petri dish containing the seeds into the container, without submersion, and sealing. Seeds were sanitized for one hour, removed from the container and allowed to off-gas overnight. Seed germination tests were performed to verify seed viability. Sanitization was confirmed for bacteria on Trypticase Soy Agar plates (TSA) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and mold/fungi were confirmed on Inhibitory Mold Agar (IMA) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24–48 h for observation of bacterial growth and up to 120 h for fungal growth. 2.2. Pillow Assembly, Layout, and Processing All pillows were assembled at Kennedy Space Center, FL and prepared for flight as described in detail by Massa et al., 2017 [34]. Briefly, the Veggie pillows contained 250 mL of autoclaved, porous, arcillite substrate with controlled release fertilizer (Nutricote 18-6-8, type 100, Florikan ESA, Sarasota, FL, USA) mixed at 7.5 g/L dry substrate. Two surface sanitized seeds were attached with guar gum to germination wicks in each plant pillow. The mixed crop pillow layout for each study is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Veggie technical demonstrations on ISS (VEG-03D, VEG-03E, and VEG-03F) showing the pillow and plant layout for each. The ‘*’ indicates pillows returned from ISS for analysis. ‘OL’ is ‘Outredgeous’ red romaine lettuce; ‘WG’ is ‘Waldmann’s Green’ leaf lettuce; ‘Mizuna’ is mizuna mustard greens.The Veggie production system is a small plant growth chamber. Designed and built by ORBITEC (Madison, WI, US) to grow crops in space, it is equipped with LED lighting, a passive watering system and a fan to generate airflow [25,26]. The SN 002 system was launched to the ISS in 2014 aboard Space X CRS-3, while the SN 001 unit was launched aboard Orbital ATK OA-7 in 2017. A HOBO (honest observer by onset) data logger (Onset, Bourne, MA, US) was placed in the Veggie units used for VEG-03D and VEG-03E to record humidity, dew point, and temperature data (Figure S1). HOBO data were not collected from VEG-03F. 2.3. On-Orbit Operations On-orbit operations for VEG-03D, E, and F were similar to previous Veggie tech demo missions [28,35] with the exception of (1) 160 mL water injection for initiation; and (2) the root mat was installed without being filled with water to mitigate potential overwatering observed in previous missions. Because these growth tests were conducted by the crew autonomously using their own time, there were no ground control experiments conducted. During VEG-03D operation, a fan anomaly occurred, causing a rise in humidity to 100% for approximately 25 days inside the Veggie facility and condensation on the bellows surface (Table S1). During the growth tests, wipes containing Pro-San (Microcide, Sterling Heights, MI, USA), an organic acid-based food surface sanitizer had been used one or two times to sanitize any obvious fungal growth on the surface of pillows and/or on the threads that hold the pillows together. The crew followed the Veggie tech demo protocols to harvest samples for analyses and to sanitize the surface of fresh leaves with Pro-San wipes before consumption. Pictures were taken for the Veggie team to evaluate plant health and other potential issues, and watering dates and volumes were documented. 2.4. Surface Sample Collection Surface swab samples were collected by the crew from 8 different sites within or on the Veggie facility using self-contained sterile swabs (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), three from the interior bellows, one from the upper one-third of the bellows, one in the middle, and the third from the lower portion, three plant pillow top surfaces, one from the internal fan screen, and one from the fan outlet vent ports. After sample collection, the swabs were returned to the sterile container and stored frozen at −80 °C in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer on ISS (MELFI). 2.5. Sample Processing Leaves from the second and final harvests, swabs and selected plant pillows were maintained at −80 °C in MELFI until returned to Earth. Upon return all samples were stored at −80 °C until processing. Plant leaf samples and swabs were removed from the freezer and processed immediately. Pillows were thawed at 4 °C overnight. Substrate, wicks, and roots were removed from each pillow and divided for microbiological and molecular analyses (Figure 3). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Veggie pillow after return from ISS; (A) top and (B) bottom, (C) root and arcillite substrate sample collection, (D) frozen leaf tissue sample. 2.6. Microbiological Analysis Leaf and pillow samples were placed into 50 mL centrifuge tubes with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 3–4 mm sterile glass beads, weighed then shaken for 2 cycles at 5 m/s for 30 s each on the Omni BeadRuptor (OMNI, Kennesaw, GA, USA). Swabs were placed into tubes containing sterile PBS with 0.3% Tween 80 and vortexed at high speed for 30 s before plating. All samples were diluted with PBS and plated in duplicate onto TSA for bacteria and IMA for fungi. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h for TSA and 72–120 h for IMA and enumerated. Colony phenotypes were selected from each sample and isolated on the respective agars. Bacterial colonies were identified using the Biolog Micro ID System (Biolog, Hayward, CA, USA). The MicroSEQ 16S rDNA sequencing kit was also utilized to identify bacterial isolates while fungal and yeast colonies were identified using the MicroSEQ D2 LSU rDNA kit for fungi (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA was extracted from isolates using Prepman System for bacteria or the Qiagen Powerlyzer Soil Kit for fungi. All MicroSeq sequencing was completed on the ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Bacterial and fungal DNA sequences were identified using the MicroSeq ID Software V2.0 (Bacterial Library, 2009 and Fungal Library 2011) followed by  Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Petrifilms were also used to identify and enumerate Escherichia coli/coliform and Staphylococcus aureus for microbial food safety screening (3M, St. Paul, MN, USA). Petrifilms were incubated at 35 °C for 24 h per manufacturer’s guidelines and any colonies positive for E. coli/coliform and S. aureus were enumerated and re-isolated. Re-isolated colonies were identified using Biolog GEN III plates. To screen for Salmonella, 1 mL of sample extract was added to an additional volume of buffered peptone water (BPW) and incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. A 1 mL aliquot was then transferred into 5 mL of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) broth or Tetrathionate broth (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and incubated for an additional 24 h at 35 °C. The broth cultures were then streaked onto selective media for Salmonella and incubated at 35 °C for 24–48 h [36]. 2.7. Molecular Community Analysis Upon processing, components for all samples were placed in RNAlater for preservation and frozen at −20 °C until DNA isolation was completed using the Qiagen Microbial Cell DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was quantified with the QUBIT 2.0 and the double stranded high sensitivity DNA assay (Invitrogen, Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA) then diluted to 0.5 ng/µL for downstream polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was completed for each sample in triplicate with barcoded primers from the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and barcoded primers for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for fungi. Unique barcodes were assigned for both forward and reverse primers (300 nM) to multiplex samples [28,37,38]. The PCR cycling conditions in a Bio-Rad C-1000 thermocycler included enzyme activation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min for extension. A final 10 min extension at 72 °C concluded the PCR. PCR products were cleaned with the Min-Elute PCR Cleanup Kit to remove excess primers and dNTPs (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and sequenced as an equimolar library spiked with 10% PhiX DNA [28]. Sequencing was completed as paired end on the Illumina MiSeq Next Generation Sequencer (NGS) [28]. FastQ sequences were identified to the genus level using the RDP/GreenGenes and SILVA (bacteria) and Unite (fungal) databases. 2.8. Data Analysis Data from microbiological counts (log transformed) were compared using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Alpha diversity was determined using the Shannon Diversity Index and beta diversity of community sequencing was determined with Bray–Curtis dissimilarity [39] using a one-way ANOVA (QIIME 2.0) [40]. Venn diagrams were created using Venny 2.1. [41].",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Plant Germination and Growth VEG-03D was designed with a mixed horticulture layout of two pillows for each cultivar to examine the interaction of all three crop types (Figure 2). In Veg-03D, we found that the more rapidly growing mizuna plants overshadowed adjacent lettuce plants, causing watering and accessibility issues for plant maintenance. Therefore, for the VEG-03E and F growth tests, the layout was adjusted for easy access, observation, and plant maintenance (Figure 2). The overall emergence rates for mizuna and red romaine lettuce were 91.6% and 83.3%, respectively. Green leaf lettuce seeds averaged 66.6 percent germination (75% in VEG-03D vs. 62.5% in VEG-03E/F) with two stunted seedlings. After thinning, one healthy green leaf lettuce seedling failed to develop further, resulting in only two out of four pillows with healthy green leaf lettuce plants in VEG-03E and F compared to two out of two pillows with healthy green leaf lettuce plants in VEG-03D. Except for the two green leaf lettuce plants, all other plants appeared healthy. Tip burn was observed later during the grow-outs in red romaine lettuce plants. In addition, older mizuna leaves also turned yellowish with a dry edge. All these signs occurred after the 30–31-day harvest, and increased with time, especially for mizuna, indicating a possible lack of nutrients with the age of the plant. No signs of disease were found in these plants. Water usage was relatively constant with about one liter consumed per plant per 30 days (Table S1). Mizuna required a slightly higher water volume to maintain hydration and plant health compared to both lettuces. These experiments were performed by the crew in a semi-autonomous manner; the water volume was adequate for maintaining plant health, but may not have been optimal, and may have varied among the crew members who tended these plants. 3.2. Bacterial and Fungal Counts on Leaves Aerobic plate counts (APC) of bacteria on leaves from Veg-03D, E, and F harvests of the three leafy greens were in the range of 4.3 × 102 (red romaine in VEG-03E) to 3.5 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram (g) of leaf tissue. Average counts on mizuna leaves from both harvests grown in VEG-03D and E were not significantly different from each other, ranging from 1.4 × 103 to 2.6 × 107 CFU/g. The average counts on green leaf lettuce across experiments D, E, and F were 7.9 × 106, 3.5 × 107, and 5.9 × 105 CFU/g, respectively. Only one harvest was completed on the green leaf lettuce plant from E. Red romaine lettuce grown in VEG-03E had lower counts than those harvested from D and F (p ≤ 0.05). Average bacterial counts from red romaine lettuce leaves from D, E, and F were 6.9 × 106, 5.7 × 103, and 6.1 × 106 CFU/g, respectively (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Bacterial counts (CFU on TSA per gram of frozen tissue) on leaves from plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F for three crops. (A) mizuna, (B) red romaine lettuce, (C) green leaf lettuce. Open circles represent counts from the first harvest, closed circles the final harvest. Bars represent the mean and error bars are standard error of the mean. Statistical differences (p < 0.05) are indicated with an asterisk.Yeast and mold counts from the leaves grown in VEG-03D were lowest on average on mizuna, 2.4 × 104 CFU/g followed by 5.1 × 106 CFU/g on red romaine lettuce leaves and green leaf lettuce with the highest average counts at 9.8 × 109 CFU/g, however the difference between plant types was not significant. The fungal counts were higher on the second harvest leaves from all three plant types grown in VEG-03D (Figure 5). The fan anomaly may have contributed to this trend, which was not found in VEG-03E and F. All screening tests for potential food borne pathogens, E. coli, S. aureus and Salmonella sp. showed negative results. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Fungal counts (CFU on IMA per gram of frozen tissue) on leaves from plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F for three crops. (A) mizuna, (B) red romaine lettuce, (C) green leaf lettuce. Open circles represent counts from the first harvest, closed circles the final harvest. Bars represent the mean and error bars are standard error of the mean. 3.3. Bacterial and Fungal Counts on Pillow Components Plant pillows were investigated for bacterial and fungal counts from the wicking material, the roots, and the substrate inside the pillow. Figure 3 illustrates a plant pillow after the plant had been harvested and before sampling including the wicking material (Figure 3A) that initially holds the seed and wicks water from the substrate to the germinating seedling, and the substrate and roots after removal from the pillow (Figure 3C). Four pillow samples from VEG-03D (2 red romaine, 1 mizuna and 1 green leaf lettuce), 2 from VEG-03E (mizuna) and 2 from VEG-03F (red romaine) were processed for analysis. Bacterial counts on the wicking material and arcillite substrate were not influenced by plant type or Veggie facility (SN 001 or SN 002) used in the tech demo (Figure 6A). The wick samples had APC counts ranging from 1.9 × 108 to 1.8 × 109 CFU/g. Average counts from the substrate samples (n = 3) ranged from 2.6 × 106 to 2.2 × 107 CFU/g. CFU/g values on the red romaine lettuce roots grown in VEG-03F were the lowest of the root bacterial counts, 9.3 × 106 and 2.6 × 107 compared to 3.4 × 107 and 7.1 × 107 CFU/g from the red romaine lettuce roots grown in VEG-03D. Bacterial counts from mizuna and green leaf lettuce roots were all higher than the red romaine lettuce counts. Two mizuna plant roots grown in VEG-03E yielded 8.7 × 107 and 2.5 × 108 CFU/g while the mizuna roots grown in VEG-03D had the highest bacterial counts of the mizuna, 2.6 × 108 CFU/g. Only one sample of roots from the green leaf lettuce grown in VEG-03D was returned for analysis, yielding 1.3 × 108 CFU/g bacteria. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Bacterial (A) and fungal (B) counts (CFU per gram) on plant pillow components from VEG-03D, E, and F. Bars represent the median.Fungal counts are illustrated in Figure 6B. The lowest and highest counts on the wicks 4.7 × 106 to 2.2 ×108 CFU/g were from the 2 red romaine pillows from VEG-03D. Fungal counts were highest in mizuna roots and substrate from the same VEG-03E pillow with the highest bacterial counts, however, the lowest fungal counts were from the VEG-03D pillow that also had similarly high bacterial counts, indicating no correlation. 3.4. Bacterial and Fungal Counts on Surface Samples Swab samples were collected after the harvest was complete but before wiping down of the interior bellows with disinfectant wipes. While each sample site is a different location, distinct sample sites are the same across the three tech demos. Bacteria were recovered and cultivated from all 8 sample sites from VEG-03D, 3 out of 8 samples in VEG-03E and 5 out of 8 in VEG-03F (Table 2). Fungi were recovered from 5, 3, and 7 samples out of 8 from VEG-03D, E, and F, respectively. Bacteria and fungi were recovered from the fan screen and at least two of the pillow surfaces across all the experiments (Table 3). VEG-03E was run in SN 001 Veggie facility, a unit that was just installed and had not been used before on ISS, had the fewest locations with recovery of bacteria and fungi. VEG-03D and F were run in the same Veggie SN 002 facility, the older Veggie on ISS. Bacterial counts (CFU/swab) on surfaces from VEG-03D ranged from 3.5 × 101 on the fan screen to 6.0 × 104 on the pillow surface. Several samples from VEG-03E were below the detection limit with the exception of the fan screen and two pillow samples. VEG-03F had the highest CFUs on the pillow surfaces ranging from 1.3 × 105 to 4.0 × 106/swab. Fungi from VEG-03D samples ranged from below detection to 4.5 × 103 CFU per swab.

Cultivated Bacteria and Fungi Isolate Identification Cultivation and recovery of the bacteria and fungi present in all samples was dependent on survival during sample storage as well as growth medium and incubation conditions and represents a fraction of the taxa present, however community sequencing verified the presence of each of the cultivated bacterial and fungal genera. A total of 30 bacterial genera were isolated on TSA and identified from VEG-03D, E, and F plant, pillow, and surface samples (Table 3). Several genera were isolated from samples from all three Veggie sample sets including Burkholderia, Chryseobacterium, Leifsonia, Microbacterium, Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus. More genera were recovered and identified from VEG-03D (20) than from E or F, and eight of the 30 isolates were unique to VEG-03D samples (Table 3). The fungi, Aspergillus spp., Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium spp. and Rhodotorula spp. where ubiquitous across samples from all three tech demos (Table 4). Exophiala spp. was identified in only one sample from VEG-03E, the substrate, and swab samples from E and F recovered Purpureocillium lilacinum. All fungi, except the Purpureocillium isolated only from swab samples, were verified by community sequencing. Because swab samples yielded no DNA, we were not able to verify the presence of Purpureocillium. An additional 26 genera of fungi were identified in samples using community sequencing of the ITS region (Table S5). Table 4.

Microbial Diversity Alpha and beta diversity represent the variation within and between samples. Alpha diversity of VEG-03D, E, and F, determined by the Shannon Index, ranged between 0.1 (very low) and 2.0 (Tables S2–S4). Arcillite substrate and root tissue had the highest diversity indices followed by the wick, then leaf tissue. Leaf tissue for all plant types had the lowest alpha diversity. Alpha diversity for the swabs taken for the three experiments fell between 0.8 and 1.4. The distribution as determined by the Pielou Evenness Index measurement indicated the genera present were not evenly distributed with values ranging from 0.3 for substrate to 0.1 for leaf tissue. This trend was consistent between all three experiments (Tables S2–S4). Beta diversity as determined between samples with the Bray–Curtis calculation in QIIME 2.0 was conceptualized as PCoA plots (Figure 7 and Figure 8A–E). Beta diversity was calculated between all leaf tissues returned from ISS (Figure 7 and Table S6). Just over 50% of the variation between plant types could be explained in the 2 axes of the PCoA (Figure 7). Plants from VEG-03D presented a visual clustering of leaves for all plant types with the exception one green lettuce leaf demonstrating similarity of the microbial communities. VEG-03E and F grown later do not cluster tightly indicating potential diversity differences. The corresponding Adonis statistics provides a permutation statistic of the analysis of variance which provides an R2 value indicating the % variance explained by each group. The lower the R2 value the more similar the samples. The R2 value for all plant types (0.397) indicated that approximately 40% of the variation is derived from the influence of the tech demo (p = 0.001) versus only 10% (0.101) was due to the plant type. The influence of the plant type was not significant. Figure 7. Open in a new tab PCoA plot represents the plant leaf tissue returned from VEG-03D, E, and F on the ISS. Plant type MM is mizuna mustard, OL is ‘Outredgeous’ red romaine lettuce and WG is ‘Waldmann’s Green’ leaf lettuce.Figure 8. Open in a new tab PCoA plots represent the plant and pillow components for VEG-03D, E and F tech demonstrations performed on ISS. (A) is VEG-03D mizuna mustard, (B) is red romaine lettuce, (C) is green lettuce, (D) is VEG-03E mizuna mustard and (E) is VEG-03F red romaine lettuce.Beta diversity was also compared among the plant types to include the plant leaf and root and the Veggie pillow substrate and wick. Each crop type was considered separately within the three experiments (Figure 8). VEG-03D contained the following: one pillow with mizuna mustard (Figure 8A), two pillows with red romaine lettuce (Figure 8B) and one pillow with green leaf lettuce (Figure 8C). The PCoA of the three plant types with their associated pillow components in VEG-03D captured a high percentage of the variation within a single axis, with 67%, 76%, and 79%, respectively. The PCoAs for VEG-03D indicate that the green leaf lettuce leaf microbiome was more dissimilar from the root, wick, and substrate. However, the root and substrate were similar. Approximately 99% of the variation accounted for within the pillow sample set was due to the sample type itself (Figure 8C and Table S6). The additional two crops grown in VEG-03D displayed the same trends with root and substrate microbiomes more similar while the plant leaf microbiomes were dissimilar containing a greater amount of variation (97% and 84% for mizuna and red romaine lettuce, respectively) (Figure 8 and Table S6). In all pillow samples, the wick, which did not cluster with root and substrate, appeared to be more variable. The variation captured for the VEG-03E and F experiments was lower than seen in VEG-03D with approximately 40% of the variation explained in the first principle component for VEG-03E (Figure 8D) and approximately 50% for VEG-03F (Figure 8E). In these two experiments, the wick again appeared to have the greatest variance from other components. Leaf, root, and substrate were more similar. The R2 values for VEG-03E indicated 63% of the variation was due to the sample type, whereas in VEG-03F, 77% of the variation was attributed to the sample type. All comparisons were significant (p < 0.05) (Figure 8 and Table S6). 3.7. Community Characterization Community characterization of the pillow components and plant tissue (leaf, root, substrate, and wick) was analyzed at the genus level to determine unique and shared genera (Figure 9). There were few genera common to all four components in each of the three technical demonstrations, (VEG-03D, E, F) and ranged between one and nine genera. VEG-03D green leaf lettuce plant and pillow samples had the highest number of shared genera with nine (Figure 9A). In all three tech demos the wick component revealed a high number of unique genera between 2–19; the highest number of unique genera occurring in VEG-03E mizuna mustard pillow wicks (Figure 9B). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Venn diagrams revealing unique and shared genera across the 3 tech demos and crop types. (A) VEG-03D samples, (B) VEG-03E samples, (C) VEG-03F samples. Diagrams depict plant and corresponding pillow components (wick, substrate, and root tissue). Numbers are the number of genera with greater than 50 sequencing reads. The % is the percent total reads. Venn diagrams were completed with Venny v 2.1.Figure 9A illustrates a high number of genera shared between wick, substrate, and root tissue in VEG-03D with 26 in mizuna, 22 and 31 in red romaine lettuce, and 27 in green leaf lettuce. The number of shared genera among VEG-03E components was higher for mizuna mustard at 31 and VEG-03F had 30 shared genera between wick, substrate, and root tissue (Figure 9C). Root tissue had few unique genera, but in all crops the root had high numbers of shared genera with substrate (6–28) and between root, substrate, and wick (22–31) which included more than 40% of the genera present (Figure 9). Leaf tissue had a variable number of unique species with VEG-03D having the highest with 11 in red romaine lettuce, followed by 10 in mizuna in VEG-03E. Overall, characterization of genera in the four plant and pillow components revealed few unique species in each of the components but indicated a higher number of shared species especially among root, substrate, and wick (Figure 9). A closer inspection of the top community constituents revealed that variations in the bacterial makeup between pillow sections (wick, substrate, and root) differed from the leaf tissue (Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12). VEG-03D which included analysis of all three leafy green crops grown yielded several bacterial constituents seen in all plant types (Figure 10). These included Burkholderia, Enterobacter, Erwinia and Pseudomonas. However, there were fewer numbers of genera in leaves than in the root, wick, or substrate, which is not unexpected. There were more similar constituents in the wick, substrate, and root with Burkholderia and Novosphingobium identified in each component for all crops (Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12). The wick material appeared to present a higher variation in genera than did root or substrate. Figure 10. Open in a new tab VEG-03D technical demonstration.

Percent is based upon the abundance of sequencing reads.The VEG-03E samples and pillows returned from ISS were mizuna mustard (Figure 11) while VEG-03F were red romaine lettuce (Figure 12). Again, all samples contained Burkholderia with some samples containing up to 50% of the total abundance of sequencing reads. VEG-03E mizuna mustard pillow substrate and root tissues contained higher levels of Novosphingobium than seen in the VEG-03D tech demo. Staphylococcus was present in mizuna leaf from one VEG-03E pillow accounting for a large percent of the 15 listed and present in small fraction in the wick although was not detectable in the root or substrate. The wick material had a higher level of variability in the bacterial genera detected (Figure 11). The VEG-03F tech demo comparing red romaine lettuce plant and pillow samples showed less variation in the bacterial genera in the wick and leaf compared to VEG-03D and E. Pseudomonas which was prevalent in most wick materials in VEG-03D, E and F could also be detected in leaf tissue (Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12). Ralstonia, and Pseudomonas were also present in all samples from all three tech demos. (Figure 10 and Figure 12). Several genera were present in VEG-03D (Figure 10) and F (Figure 12) but not in E. The genera Enterobacter, Chitinophaga, Novosphingobium and Bradyrhizobium are a few that were identified in all of the Veg-03D samples as well as some of the VEG-03F samples. In VEG-03D Methylobacterium was identified in red romaine lettuce and mizuna while Janthinobacterium was identified in red romaine.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion The Veggie plant growth units deployed on the ISS have provided a platform to grow leafy greens for astronaut consumption since 2014. This series of tech demonstrations was the first time that mixed cropping was tested in Veggie, with three leafy greens. Plant growth was successful, however, there may have been an influence on growth based on plant type and position in the Veggie. It was observed in VEG 03-D that the mizuna canopy shaded the adjacent red romaine lettuce plant possibly limiting exposure to light and effecting maintenance. Germination was lower with the green leaf lettuce resulting in fewer and smaller plants. Mixed cropping could also have an impact on the transfer of plant-specific phyllosphere microbiota between crop types [14,16,20]. Microbiological food safety of Veggie-grown crops is assured by routine culture-based pathogen screening and bacterial and fungal enumeration on crops grown in ground analogs as well as samples returned from ISS. The bacterial and fungal count data and pathogen screening performed on the plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F indicates from a microbial food safety perspective, the crops are low risk to the crew. With approximately 10% of a microbial community identified with culturable methods, sequencing of both bacterial and fungal constituents provides additional identification of the community microbiota [42]. These data allow for the identification of the non-culturable microbes including the identification of beneficial microbes and microbes of concern and the confirmation of the negative culture-based screening results for E. coli and Salmonella. Many of the genera isolated and identified from the Veggie plant phyllosphere are present in terrestrially grown leafy greens. Several surveys of leafy greens revealed that Pseudomonas species dominate the phyllosphere. A study done on two types of leafy greens, rocket salad and lettuce, showed that Pseudomonas, was the most abundant genera present, followed by Pantoea, Arthrobacter and Acinetobacter [14]. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. was identified by culture independent methods on all samples except one mizuna plant in VEG-03E. Burkholderia was identified in all plant samples by culture and culture independent methods. This is in contrast with other surveys of field grown leafy greens where Burkholderia is not a dominant member of the core microbiome [14,15,16]. However, Burkholderia was found on both ISS grown and ground controls in an earlier study done on Veggie grown red romaine lettuce [28]. Bacterial counts (CFU/g) from field and hydroponic grown lettuce have been reported in the range of 4 × 104 to 2 × 108 and fungal counts (CFU/g) between 8 × 102 and 2 × 106 [43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51]. The bacterial and fungal counts on leaves of plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F were in the range of the reported values for farm or market produce counts of similar type. However, when compared to the analysis of red romaine lettuce from previous Veggie tech demos [28], the bacterial and fungal counts per gram of red romaine lettuce leaf tissue from VEG-03D and F were higher. As with previous ISS grown leafy greens [28,51] an increase in fungal counts was observed in some of the samples with repeated harvests especially in VEG-03D. VEG-03A and VEG-03D were run in the same Veggie facility (SN 002) and during plant growth, in both cases, the humidity was higher than other grow-outs. Humidity is a factor that can influence the microbial density and community in the phyllosphere and the surface of the leaf. It has been demonstrated that higher humidity and leaf wetness increases fungal abundance on plants including fungal plant pathogens [29,52,53]. The characterization of the spatial distribution of microbiota on the Veggie facility surfaces, plant growth pillows, and multi-species plant tissues was performed to elucidate possible sources and routes of transfer of microbes around the Veggie facility and plants. Generally, surface sample microbial count data showed low counts on the interior bellows surfaces, and below detection level counts mostly in VEG-03E. After harvest, the bellows are cleaned thoroughly by the crew with disinfectant wipes, perhaps minimizing microbial proliferation. The pillow surfaces had the highest counts of all surfaces sampled and are in close proximity with the moist wicking material, the plant and any plant debris which could facilitate inoculation and growth. Bacteria and fungi were recovered from the fan screen in all cases. The genera of bacteria and fungi cultured and identified have also been identified in studies to monitor the microbial profiles of the ISS. Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Aspergillus and Penicillium were all identified in an examination of ISS air filters and dust samples [54]. Several of the same genera from the previous study were isolated and identified from the ISS vacuum cleaner bag, and also included Paenibacillus, Methylobacterium, Klebsiella, and Azospirillum [55]. In addition, studies done on the microbial communities associated with surfaces on the ISS identify many of the same genera identified from the Veggie surface samples collected in this study [30,32]. We compared bacterial genera from Avila-Herrera et al. [56] comprehensive characterization of ISS surface and crew samples with the Veggie facility surfaces and leaves characterized in the current study and found 250 genera shared between the Veggie facility surfaces and ISS samples. The leaves, Veggie surfaces and ISS samples had 47 common genera suggesting microbial transfer and colonization between these locations (Figure S2). Beta diversity analysis of all plants grown in the three tech demos resulted in a tight clustering of plants from VEG-03D with the exception of one green lettuce leaf demonstrating similarity of the microbial communities within VEG-03D. VEG-03E and F grown later do not cluster tightly indicating potential diversity differences (Figure 8). These differences could be the result of many factors, including the different configuration of the three crops in each Veggie, the environmental conditions present at the time of the grow-out, i.e., temperature, CO2 and humidity, crew interaction, microbes present in the surrounding air, and irrigation water. Previous studies on field-grown leafy greens have shown that seasonal and temporal variation exists on the phyllosphere microbial communities, effected by leaf age, weather, location and soil type [14,15,57]. Unlike terrestrial agriculture, a sanitized, soilless substrate is used in Veggie to support root growth. It is aseptically packed into sterile “pillows” along with controlled release fertilizer [34]. The seeds are surface sanitized before planting, removing most epiphytes from the seed surface, and the water used to hydrate the plant pillows is relatively clean water from the ISS potable water system [35,58]. Consequently, the horticultural practices employed in Veggie may limit the sources of microbiota contributing to the development of the plant microbiome. As a whole, the phytomicrobiome is shaped and recruited by the plant from its associated habitat [3,4,6,10,59]. Rhizosphere microbiomes assemble through the selection of soil microorganisms by the production of plant root exudates [60,61,62]. The Veggie soilless substrate is essentially microbe free until the introduction of water, seed germination and exposure to the ISS environment. Water and air from the ISS have been monitored by NASA for many years and two genera commonly identified from the potable water are Burkholderia and Ralstonia [58,63]. The dominant bacterial genera in Veggie samples analyzed in this study, Burkholderia, was found across plant types and Veggie facility materials in both culture and molecular assays. The genus Burkholderia contains over 60 known species and was abundant in many of the Veggie samples, primarily in the pillow substrate, root tissue, and wicks, but in very low abundance or was absent in leaf tissue indicating the genus may have been introduced through the water source or possibly was present in the seed. Burkholderia has been identified as a potential, beneficial plant-associated microbe, however some species are implicated in human opportunistic infections [21,64,65] Ralstonia, also found in ISS water, was identified in community sequencing across all plant type roots, wicks, and substrate. Some species of Ralstonia have the potential to cause stress in plants or may be an opportunistic pathogen [66,67,68]. Pseudomonas sp., present in the top 15 genera in community sequencing in all samples but one mizuna plant and pillow from VEG-03E may be a saprophytic epi-endophyte on plant tissue [16,64,69,70,71]. It has been reported to be a potential promotor of plant growth by producing plant stimulating hormones as well as increasing disease resistance [71]. These demonstrations, D and F were completed in the same Veggie unit, SN 002, and therefore not surprising that similar microbes would be detected. Several genera were identified by sequencing in VEG-03D and F but not in E. The genera Enterobacter, Chitinophaga, Novosphingobium, and Bradyrhizobium are a few that were identified in all of the Veg-03D samples as well as some of the VEG-03F samples. Chitinophaga sp., works with certain fungal species as an endosymbiont to enhance nutrient uptake and growth [66,72]. The presence of Chitinophaga could be correlated with stress conditions and environmental disturbances [66,72]. In VEG-03D Methylobacterium was identified in red romaine and mizuna while Janthinobacterium was isolated in red romaine only. Recently it was reported that 4 strains of Methylobacterium, one a newly characterized strain, were isolated on the ISS with the Microbial Monitoring experiments [73]. Methylobacterium are involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens [74,75] and is a methylotrophic with the ability to utilize methanol produced by plants as a carbon source [76] Janthinobacterium is a soil bacterium with a wide range of metabolic activities, including antimicrobial properties and resistance to stressors such as UV radiation and cold temperatures providing a benefit to plants [77,78,79]. During the grow outs of VEG-03E and F, the genera Nevskia and Spirosoma were present in VEG-03E but not seen in VEG-03F. This could be due to a natural variation between mizuna and red romaine lettuce as each plant may have its own native microbiota, or it may have been introduced. These bacteria were detected in root and leaf samples from previous Veggie tech demos, VEG-01A, B and VEG-03A [28]. If the source of these bacteria is the water initially introduced into the soilless substrate and subsequently wicked to the seeds, this suggests possible mechanisms of transfer of water borne bacteria from the seed to the root or recruitment by the root from the surrounding substrate. An in-depth genomic analysis would have to be performed to elucidate possible sources of microbial transfer. All the bacteria cultured and identified from root samples, Burkholderia, Flavomonas, Leifsonia, Methylobacterium, Microbacterium and Rhizobium were also identified in the wick samples. Presumably, the sources of these bacteria are the ISS water, the endophytic seed population, circulating air, and/or human interaction with the plants, therefore diversity of the root microbiome could be limited by the populations in these sources. Eleven of the 12 identified isolates found on the leaf samples were not isolated from the roots, in corroboration with the 16S rRNA analysis of community comparison which revealed no shared species between the leaf and root. In the culture-based assays, 6 of the leaf-isolated bacteria were also found on the wicks. Different parts of the plant, i.e., leaves and roots support distinct microbial communities [80,81]. Patterns of genera common across the substrate, root, wicks, and leaves suggest alternate modes of bacterial and fungal transmission. For example, the substrate, roots, and wicks share the highest number of genera for all pillow sample sets tested while the leaves share a higher number of genera with the wicking material (Figure 9). This suggests the possibility of horizontal transfer of bacteria from substrate to root or the converse. The substrate starts as a sterile matrix therefore the introduction of microbes could be primarily limited to the ISS potable water, microbes within the ISS, those harbored on the Veggie surfaces, or the endophytic seed microbiota. The seed microbiome of two of the three crops, red romaine lettuce and mizuna mustard, have been investigated at KSC in numerous studies since the inception of the Veggie technology demonstrations. The microbiome of both sanitized and unsanitized seeds indicated that in all seeds, abundance of microbial communities/genera was low and the genus Thermogemmatispora predominated, and then declined post-germination., In addition, Trichodesmium and some genera of cyanobacteria were detected along with low abundance of Burkholderia, Acinetobacter, and Corynebacterium. These latter three appear to persist in the plants after germination [82]. Very few genera are shared between the leaf and substrate and the leaf and root whereas the wick has more genera in common with the leaf than the substrate and root, indicating a vertical transfer from the above “ground” wick material and the shoot of the plant. Resident microbial populations on the leaf may be transported from the ISS environment, including the circulating air and human interaction. Human associated Staphylococcus was identified on the leaves, surfaces, and wicks from cultured isolates and for 16S community sequencing, it was the dominant bacteria among the top 15 identified in one VEG-03E mizuna leaf sample. Other potential human and plant associated bacterial genera identified were Erwinia, Burkholderia, and Clavibacter. Extensive genotyping of these isolates would be required to evaluate the strain and the ability to infect the host. Four of the fungal species identified, Aspergillus spp., Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium spp., Rhodotorula spp. were found in all tech demos. In previous studies of Veggie-grown plants, Fusarium oxysporum was not found on the first growth of lettuce or surfaces of Veggie from the tech demo designated VEG-01A but has since been isolated in all subsequent tech demos [28] (unpublished data). This suggests that once bacteria or fungi become established in Veggie units and the ISS environment, unless eliminated by the cleaning and maintenance protocols, they could persist as members of the facility microbiome and consequently the plant microbiome. In conclusion, characterization of the microbiome of ISS plant growth systems and crops is critical, not only for near term assurance of crop food safety, but also for the understanding and development of sustainable crop systems for space exploration missions. Sources of external contamination, i.e., irrigation water, air, and human handling can be monitored and controlled. Strategies, such as the introduction of defined beneficial microbes to enhance plant growth and prevent human and plant pathogen invaders may need to be evaluated and implemented after careful study of the impact to these unique space agricultural systems.",

Copyright notice ID: 8537831 PMID: 34685431 Abstract The establishment of steady-state continuous crop production during long-term deep space missions is critical for providing consistent nutritional and psychological benefits for the crew, potentially improving their health and performance. Three technology demonstrations were completed achieving simultaneous multi-species plant growth and the concurrent use of two Veggie units on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapa var japonica); and green leaf lettuce, (Lactuca sativa cv. Waldmann’s) and associated rooting pillow components and Veggie chamber surfaces. Culture based enumeration and pathogen screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. Surface samples of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick. This work provides valuable information for food production-related research on the ISS and the impact of the plant microbiome on this unique closed environment. Keywords: veggie, ISS, microbiome, lettuce, mizuna, phyllosphere, rhizosphere, microgravity1. Introduction Future space missions and habitats will likely include crop production systems designed to provide a fresh, nutritious component to the crew diet. Understanding the complexities of plant growth systems designed with the unique challenges of space exploration missions and the associated plant microbiome is essential for sustaining the health of crop systems as well as the human consumer [1,2]. Molecular biology methods to characterize whole microbial communities through omics approaches have led to the understanding of organism and habitat-specific microbiomes. Plants and their associated microbiota exist in a complex association with important functions critical to plant growth and health. Microbes are recruited and assembled on or in plant tissues and organs from reservoirs such as the soil, rhizosphere, and phyllosphere [3,4,5,6]. Soil microbial communities are highly diverse and are horizontally transferred to the root where, at the rhizosphere, a dynamic and complex ecosystem develops [7,8,9,10,11,12]. Initial soil microbiome composition can influence plant pathogen interaction and disease resistance [13]. A plant’s phyllosphere hosts a diverse community of microbes that can also influence plant health and physiology [14,15,16,17]. Plant colonizing microorganisms are affected not only by abiotic environmental conditions such as CO2 concentration, temperature, spectral radiation, and humidity, but specific host leaf surface characteristics [14,18,19]. Studies have shown inter-plant species variability in the phyllosphere microbiome [14,16,20] and microbial colonization of the phylloplane is dependent on transmission of organisms from the environment such as aerosols, soils or other plant growth medium, and animal contact [21,22,23,24]. Conversely, it has been demonstrated that plants can influence the microbiome of the indoor built environment significantly contributing to the bacterial and fungal abundance and diversity on the surrounding surfaces [23]. The International Space Station (ISS) is an inimitable, closed environment that has been continuously inhabited by astronauts starting with Expedition 1 in November of 2000. Unlike terrestrial, built environments, the exchange of microbes from outside the ISS is infrequent and primarily limited to the exchange of international crews after months of residency on the space station, along with re-supply missions. Since 2014, plants, primarily leafy greens, have been grown in the NASA Veggie hardware which are small growth chambers on the ISS (ORBITEC now Sierra Space., Madison, WI, United States) [25,26]. Fifteen technology demonstrations directed by NASA to grow a variety of crops have been completed to date and currently there are two Veggie units (Serial number (SN) 001 and Serial number 002) in operation on ISS. The Veggie chambers (Figure 1) utilize a fan to circulate the air from outside of the chamber throughout the plant growth area facilitating an exchange of airborne microbes between the ISS atmosphere and the chamber interior. Air drawn from the ISS cabin flows from the bottom of the plant canopy to the top of the growth chamber volume. Air filtration is not present apart from screens to filter out large particles within the Veggie facility before entering the cabin [27]. Environmental conditions in which ISS grown crops have been cultivated are unlike terrestrial counterparts, in addition to an absence of gravity and natural convection. Carbon dioxide levels can reach approximately 7 to 10 times higher than ambient earth atmosphere in the closed atmosphere of the ISS, temperatures are typically between 18 °C and 23 °C and humidity is low (40–50%), however temperature and humidity can be higher inside the Veggie chamber. A collapsible, transparent bellows contains the plant growing area and any plant debris. During the on-orbit operation, the plant crops are tended, harvested, and consumed by the crew and are intended to provide a nutritional supplement to their diet. At the completion of a harvest, all plant growth containers, known as plant pillows, are discarded, or stored frozen for return to Earth and the bellows and other surfaces are cleaned with disinfectant wipes in preparation for the next crop. Figure 1. Open in a new tab (A) VEG-03D (SN 002) with ambient light and bellows down. (B) VEG-03E (SN 001) with bellows lowered and plant base plate raised to a more vertical position and VEG-03F (SN 002) partially visible on the right of VEG-03E with bellows raised.Microbial analyses using culture-based and culture-independent methods of Veggie-grown crops and growth chamber components have been completed to provide baseline data to ensure the microbiological safety for consumption by the astronauts. Subsequently, an in-depth characterization of bacterial and fungal communities associated with three crop grow-outs of red romaine lettuce that may impact astronaut and plant health has been reported [28]. Plants grown in Veggie are susceptible to abiotic factors inherent in microgravity plant cultivation such as water stress and humidity control. Without careful control and monitoring, the environmental conditions within Veggie can promote undesirable levels of microbial growth. Zinnia hybrida, a flowering plant grown in Veggie in 2015–2016 became infected with the plant opportunistic pathogen Fusarium oxysporum after failure of the ventilation system led to an increase in humidity inside the chamber [29]. The source of the fungus was not determined definitively, however F. oxysporum has been isolated on surfaces on the ISS [29,30,31,32,33]. Furthermore, F. oxysporum was among the fungal isolates identified from leaves and roots from two out of three Veggie demonstrations growing red romaine lettuce [28]. The introduction of microbes from the air, water, or human interaction onto the plant surfaces of an edible crop potentially establishes a risk to the consumer. Crew safety and health is of paramount consideration when supplying a fresh food source through Veggie crop production and the characterization of the microbial communities in Veggie furthers the assurance that these crops are appropriate and safe for human consumption. The VEG-03D, E, and F series of technology demonstrations discussed in this work are the first mixed crop use of the Veggie facility with the growth of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapa var japonica); and green leaf lettuce, (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Waldmann’s Green’). In addition to the demonstration of a mixed cultivar approach and continuous harvest using two Veggie systems, the objective of this study was to characterize and compare the bioburden and composition of the microbial communities within the Veggie plant growth units at different locations including above ground plant tissues, roots of 3 plant cultivars, Veggie facility surfaces, and plant pillow materials. We identified through culture- based and culture-independent methods dominant and shared genera of bacteria and fungi in plants, growth substrate, and Veggie facility surfaces. This study demonstrated simultaneous multi-species leafy green growth and the influence of the plant leaf and root associated microbial communities across plant species and Veggie growth chamber components.2. Materials and Methods The VEG-03D, VEG-03E, and VEG-03F technical demonstrations aboard ISS present a mixed, multi-crop study with the inclusion of a “cut-and-come-again” component where plants were partially harvested and then re-grown to yield more produce for a given the amount of resources and to determine effects on the harvest. A total of four harvests were conducted for each grow-out, with the second and half of the fourth/final harvest preserved for later microbial analysis, and the remaining harvests consumed by astronauts. The leafy greens included were red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapa var japonica); and green leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Waldmann’s Green’). Three separate grow-outs were conducted in the two Veggie production systems on ISS with initiation in September 2017 (VEG-03D) and February 2018 (VEG-03E and F). VEG-03E and F were grown three days apart in different Veggie units to test the concept of sustainable cultivation and continuous harvest for provision of fresh produce (Table 1). Table 1.

Seed Preparation Seeds for each crop were surface sanitized using a chlorine gas fuming method as described by Massa et al. [34]. Briefly, seeds were batch sanitized by adding 0.5 mL HCL to 30 mL bleach in a 250 mL container by placing an open Petri dish containing the seeds into the container, without submersion, and sealing. Seeds were sanitized for one hour, removed from the container and allowed to off-gas overnight. Seed germination tests were performed to verify seed viability. Sanitization was confirmed for bacteria on Trypticase Soy Agar plates (TSA) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and mold/fungi were confirmed on Inhibitory Mold Agar (IMA) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24–48 h for observation of bacterial growth and up to 120 h for fungal growth. 2.2. Pillow Assembly, Layout, and Processing All pillows were assembled at Kennedy Space Center, FL and prepared for flight as described in detail by Massa et al., 2017 [34]. Briefly, the Veggie pillows contained 250 mL of autoclaved, porous, arcillite substrate with controlled release fertilizer (Nutricote 18-6-8, type 100, Florikan ESA, Sarasota, FL, USA) mixed at 7.5 g/L dry substrate. Two surface sanitized seeds were attached with guar gum to germination wicks in each plant pillow. The mixed crop pillow layout for each study is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Veggie technical demonstrations on ISS (VEG-03D, VEG-03E, and VEG-03F) showing the pillow and plant layout for each. The ‘*’ indicates pillows returned from ISS for analysis. ‘OL’ is ‘Outredgeous’ red romaine lettuce; ‘WG’ is ‘Waldmann’s Green’ leaf lettuce; ‘Mizuna’ is mizuna mustard greens.The Veggie production system is a small plant growth chamber. Designed and built by ORBITEC (Madison, WI, US) to grow crops in space, it is equipped with LED lighting, a passive watering system and a fan to generate airflow [25,26]. The SN 002 system was launched to the ISS in 2014 aboard Space X CRS-3, while the SN 001 unit was launched aboard Orbital ATK OA-7 in 2017. A HOBO (honest observer by onset) data logger (Onset, Bourne, MA, US) was placed in the Veggie units used for VEG-03D and VEG-03E to record humidity, dew point, and temperature data (Figure S1). HOBO data were not collected from VEG-03F.2.3. On-Orbit Operations On-orbit operations for VEG-03D, E, and F were similar to previous Veggie tech demo missions [28,35] with the exception of (1) 160 mL water injection for initiation; and (2) the root mat was installed without being filled with water to mitigate potential overwatering observed in previous missions. Because these growth tests were conducted by the crew autonomously using their own time, there were no ground control experiments conducted. During VEG-03D operation, a fan anomaly occurred, causing a rise in humidity to 100% for approximately 25 days inside the Veggie facility and condensation on the bellows surface (Table S1). During the growth tests, wipes containing Pro-San (Microcide, Sterling Heights, MI, USA), an organic acid-based food surface sanitizer had been used one or two times to sanitize any obvious fungal growth on the surface of pillows and/or on the threads that hold the pillows together. The crew followed the Veggie tech demo protocols to harvest samples for analyses and to sanitize the surface of fresh leaves with Pro-San wipes before consumption. Pictures were taken for the Veggie team to evaluate plant health and other potential issues, and watering dates and volumes were documented.2.4. Surface Sample Collection Surface swab samples were collected by the crew from 8 different sites within or on the Veggie facility using self-contained sterile swabs (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), three from the interior bellows, one from the upper one-third of the bellows, one in the middle, and the third from the lower portion, three plant pillow top surfaces, one from the internal fan screen, and one from the fan outlet vent ports. After sample collection, the swabs were returned to the sterile container and stored frozen at −80 °C in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer on ISS (MELFI).2.5. Sample Processing Leaves from the second and final harvests, swabs and selected plant pillows were maintained at −80 °C in MELFI until returned to Earth. Upon return all samples were stored at −80 °C until processing. Plant leaf samples and swabs were removed from the freezer and processed immediately. Pillows were thawed at 4 °C overnight. Substrate, wicks, and roots were removed from each pillow and divided for microbiological and molecular analyses (Figure 3). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Veggie pillow after return from ISS; (A) top and (B) bottom, (C) root and arcillite substrate sample collection, (D) frozen leaf tissue sample.2.6. Microbiological Analysis Leaf and pillow samples were placed into 50 mL centrifuge tubes with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 3–4 mm sterile glass beads, weighed then shaken for 2 cycles at 5 m/s for 30 s each on the Omni BeadRuptor (OMNI, Kennesaw, GA, USA). Swabs were placed into tubes containing sterile PBS with 0.3% Tween 80 and vortexed at high speed for 30 s before plating. All samples were diluted with PBS and plated in duplicate onto TSA for bacteria and IMA for fungi. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h for TSA and 72–120 h for IMA and enumerated. Colony phenotypes were selected from each sample and isolated on the respective agars. Bacterial colonies were identified using the Biolog Micro ID System (Biolog, Hayward, CA, USA). The MicroSEQ 16S rDNA sequencing kit was also utilized to identify bacterial isolates while fungal and yeast colonies were identified using the MicroSEQ D2 LSU rDNA kit for fungi (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA was extracted from isolates using Prepman System for bacteria or the Qiagen Powerlyzer Soil Kit for fungi. All MicroSeq sequencing was completed on the ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Bacterial and fungal DNA sequences were identified using the MicroSeq ID Software V2.0 (Bacterial Library, 2009 and Fungal Library 2011) followed by  Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Petrifilms were also used to identify and enumerate Escherichia coli/coliform and Staphylococcus aureus for microbial food safety screening (3M, St. Paul, MN, USA). Petrifilms were incubated at 35 °C for 24 h per manufacturer’s guidelines and any colonies positive for E. coli/coliform and S. aureus were enumerated and re-isolated. Re-isolated colonies were identified using Biolog GEN III plates. To screen for Salmonella, 1 mL of sample extract was added to an additional volume of buffered peptone water (BPW) and incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. A 1 mL aliquot was then transferred into 5 mL of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) broth or Tetrathionate broth (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and incubated for an additional 24 h at 35 °C. The broth cultures were then streaked onto selective media for Salmonella and incubated at 35 °C for 24–48 h [36]. 2.7. Molecular Community Analysis Upon processing, components for all samples were placed in RNAlater for preservation and frozen at −20 °C until DNA isolation was completed using the Qiagen Microbial Cell DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was quantified with the QUBIT 2.0 and the double stranded high sensitivity DNA assay (Invitrogen, Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA) then diluted to 0.5 ng/µL for downstream polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was completed for each sample in triplicate with barcoded primers from the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and barcoded primers for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for fungi. Unique barcodes were assigned for both forward and reverse primers (300 nM) to multiplex samples [28,37,38]. The PCR cycling conditions in a Bio-Rad C-1000 thermocycler included enzyme activation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min for extension. A final 10 min extension at 72 °C concluded the PCR. PCR products were cleaned with the Min-Elute PCR Cleanup Kit to remove excess primers and dNTPs (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and sequenced as an equimolar library spiked with 10% PhiX DNA [28]. Sequencing was completed as paired end on the Illumina MiSeq Next Generation Sequencer (NGS) [28]. FastQ sequences were identified to the genus level using the RDP/GreenGenes and SILVA (bacteria) and Unite (fungal) databases. 2.8. Data Analysis Data from microbiological counts (log transformed) were compared using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Alpha diversity was determined using the Shannon Diversity Index and beta diversity of community sequencing was determined with Bray–Curtis dissimilarity [39] using a one-way ANOVA (QIIME 2.0) [40]. Venn diagrams were created using Venny 2.1. [41].3. Results 3.1. Plant Germination and Growth VEG-03D was designed with a mixed horticulture layout of two pillows for each cultivar to examine the interaction of all three crop types (Figure 2). In Veg-03D, we found that the more rapidly growing mizuna plants overshadowed adjacent lettuce plants, causing watering and accessibility issues for plant maintenance. Therefore, for the VEG-03E and F growth tests, the layout was adjusted for easy access, observation, and plant maintenance (Figure 2). The overall emergence rates for mizuna and red romaine lettuce were 91.6% and 83.3%, respectively. Green leaf lettuce seeds averaged 66.6 percent germination (75% in VEG-03D vs. 62.5% in VEG-03E/F) with two stunted seedlings. After thinning, one healthy green leaf lettuce seedling failed to develop further, resulting in only two out of four pillows with healthy green leaf lettuce plants in VEG-03E and F compared to two out of two pillows with healthy green leaf lettuce plants in VEG-03D. Except for the two green leaf lettuce plants, all other plants appeared healthy. Tip burn was observed later during the grow-outs in red romaine lettuce plants. In addition, older mizuna leaves also turned yellowish with a dry edge. All these signs occurred after the 30–31-day harvest, and increased with time, especially for mizuna, indicating a possible lack of nutrients with the age of the plant. No signs of disease were found in these plants. Water usage was relatively constant with about one liter consumed per plant per 30 days (Table S1). Mizuna required a slightly higher water volume to maintain hydration and plant health compared to both lettuces. These experiments were performed by the crew in a semi-autonomous manner; the water volume was adequate for maintaining plant health, but may not have been optimal, and may have varied among the crew members who tended these plants. 3.2. Bacterial and Fungal Counts on Leaves Aerobic plate counts (APC) of bacteria on leaves from Veg-03D, E, and F harvests of the three leafy greens were in the range of 4.3 × 102 (red romaine in VEG-03E) to 3.5 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram (g) of leaf tissue. Average counts on mizuna leaves from both harvests grown in VEG-03D and E were not significantly different from each other, ranging from 1.4 × 103 to 2.6 × 107 CFU/g. The average counts on green leaf lettuce across experiments D, E, and F were 7.9 × 106, 3.5 × 107, and 5.9 × 105 CFU/g, respectively. Only one harvest was completed on the green leaf lettuce plant from E. Red romaine lettuce grown in VEG-03E had lower counts than those harvested from D and F (p ≤ 0.05). Average bacterial counts from red romaine lettuce leaves from D, E, and F were 6.9 × 106, 5.7 × 103, and 6.1 × 106 CFU/g, respectively (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Bacterial counts (CFU on TSA per gram of frozen tissue) on leaves from plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F for three crops. (A) mizuna, (B) red romaine lettuce, (C) green leaf lettuce. Open circles represent counts from the first harvest, closed circles the final harvest. Bars represent the mean and error bars are standard error of the mean. Statistical differences (p < 0.05) are indicated with an asterisk.Yeast and mold counts from the leaves grown in VEG-03D were lowest on average on mizuna, 2.4 × 104 CFU/g followed by 5.1 × 106 CFU/g on red romaine lettuce leaves and green leaf lettuce with the highest average counts at 9.8 × 109 CFU/g, however the difference between plant types was not significant. The fungal counts were higher on the second harvest leaves from all three plant types grown in VEG-03D (Figure 5). The fan anomaly may have contributed to this trend, which was not found in VEG-03E and F. All screening tests for potential food borne pathogens, E. coli, S. aureus and Salmonella sp. showed negative results. Figure 5.

Bacterial and Fungal Counts on Pillow Components Plant pillows were investigated for bacterial and fungal counts from the wicking material, the roots, and the substrate inside the pillow. Figure 3 illustrates a plant pillow after the plant had been harvested and before sampling including the wicking material (Figure 3A) that initially holds the seed and wicks water from the substrate to the germinating seedling, and the substrate and roots after removal from the pillow (Figure 3C). Four pillow samples from VEG-03D (2 red romaine, 1 mizuna and 1 green leaf lettuce), 2 from VEG-03E (mizuna) and 2 from VEG-03F (red romaine) were processed for analysis. Bacterial counts on the wicking material and arcillite substrate were not influenced by plant type or Veggie facility (SN 001 or SN 002) used in the tech demo (Figure 6A). The wick samples had APC counts ranging from 1.9 × 108 to 1.8 × 109 CFU/g. Average counts from the substrate samples (n = 3) ranged from 2.6 × 106 to 2.2 × 107 CFU/g. CFU/g values on the red romaine lettuce roots grown in VEG-03F were the lowest of the root bacterial counts, 9.3 × 106 and 2.6 × 107 compared to 3.4 × 107 and 7.1 × 107 CFU/g from the red romaine lettuce roots grown in VEG-03D. Bacterial counts from mizuna and green leaf lettuce roots were all higher than the red romaine lettuce counts. Two mizuna plant roots grown in VEG-03E yielded 8.7 × 107 and 2.5 × 108 CFU/g while the mizuna roots grown in VEG-03D had the highest bacterial counts of the mizuna, 2.6 × 108 CFU/g. Only one sample of roots from the green leaf lettuce grown in VEG-03D was returned for analysis, yielding 1.3 × 108 CFU/g bacteria. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Bacterial (A) and fungal (B) counts (CFU per gram) on plant pillow components from VEG-03D, E, and F. Bars represent the median.Fungal counts are illustrated in Figure 6B. The lowest and highest counts on the wicks 4.7 × 106 to 2.2 ×108 CFU/g were from the 2 red romaine pillows from VEG-03D. Fungal counts were highest in mizuna roots and substrate from the same VEG-03E pillow with the highest bacterial counts, however, the lowest fungal counts were from the VEG-03D pillow that also had similarly high bacterial counts, indicating no correlation.3.4. Bacterial and Fungal Counts on Surface Samples Swab samples were collected after the harvest was complete but before wiping down of the interior bellows with disinfectant wipes. While each sample site is a different location, distinct sample sites are the same across the three tech demos. Bacteria were recovered and cultivated from all 8 sample sites from VEG-03D, 3 out of 8 samples in VEG-03E and 5 out of 8 in VEG-03F (Table 2). Fungi were recovered from 5, 3, and 7 samples out of 8 from VEG-03D, E, and F, respectively. Bacteria and fungi were recovered from the fan screen and at least two of the pillow surfaces across all the experiments (Table 3). VEG-03E was run in SN 001 Veggie facility, a unit that was just installed and had not been used before on ISS, had the fewest locations with recovery of bacteria and fungi. VEG-03D and F were run in the same Veggie SN 002 facility, the older Veggie on ISS. Bacterial counts (CFU/swab) on surfaces from VEG-03D ranged from 3.5 × 101 on the fan screen to 6.0 × 104 on the pillow surface. Several samples from VEG-03E were below the detection limit with the exception of the fan screen and two pillow samples. VEG-03F had the highest CFUs on the pillow surfaces ranging from 1.3 × 105 to 4.0 × 106/swab. Fungi from VEG-03D samples ranged from below detection to 4.5 × 103 CFU per swab. The highest fungal load, 4.0 × 106 CFU/swab was found on samples from VEG-03F on a pillow sample (Table 2). Table 2.

Cultivated Bacteria and Fungi Isolate Identification Cultivation and recovery of the bacteria and fungi present in all samples was dependent on survival during sample storage as well as growth medium and incubation conditions and represents a fraction of the taxa present, however community sequencing verified the presence of each of the cultivated bacterial and fungal genera. A total of 30 bacterial genera were isolated on TSA and identified from VEG-03D, E, and F plant, pillow, and surface samples (Table 3). Several genera were isolated from samples from all three Veggie sample sets including Burkholderia, Chryseobacterium, Leifsonia, Microbacterium, Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus. More genera were recovered and identified from VEG-03D (20) than from E or F, and eight of the 30 isolates were unique to VEG-03D samples (Table 3). The fungi, Aspergillus spp., Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium spp. and Rhodotorula spp. where ubiquitous across samples from all three tech demos (Table 4). Exophiala spp. was identified in only one sample from VEG-03E, the substrate, and swab samples from E and F recovered Purpureocillium lilacinum. All fungi, except the Purpureocillium isolated only from swab samples, were verified by community sequencing. Because swab samples yielded no DNA, we were not able to verify the presence of Purpureocillium. An additional 26 genera of fungi were identified in samples using community sequencing of the ITS region (Table S5). Table 4.

Microbial Diversity Alpha and beta diversity represent the variation within and between samples. Alpha diversity of VEG-03D, E, and F, determined by the Shannon Index, ranged between 0.1 (very low) and 2.0 (Tables S2–S4). Arcillite substrate and root tissue had the highest diversity indices followed by the wick, then leaf tissue. Leaf tissue for all plant types had the lowest alpha diversity. Alpha diversity for the swabs taken for the three experiments fell between 0.8 and 1.4. The distribution as determined by the Pielou Evenness Index measurement indicated the genera present were not evenly distributed with values ranging from 0.3 for substrate to 0.1 for leaf tissue. This trend was consistent between all three experiments (Tables S2–S4). Beta diversity as determined between samples with the Bray–Curtis calculation in QIIME 2.0 was conceptualized as PCoA plots (Figure 7 and Figure 8A–E). Beta diversity was calculated between all leaf tissues returned from ISS (Figure 7 and Table S6). Just over 50% of the variation between plant types could be explained in the 2 axes of the PCoA (Figure 7). Plants from VEG-03D presented a visual clustering of leaves for all plant types with the exception one green lettuce leaf demonstrating similarity of the microbial communities. VEG-03E and F grown later do not cluster tightly indicating potential diversity differences. The corresponding Adonis statistics provides a permutation statistic of the analysis of variance which provides an R2 value indicating the % variance explained by each group. The lower the R2 value the more similar the samples. The R2 value for all plant types (0.397) indicated that approximately 40% of the variation is derived from the influence of the tech demo (p = 0.001) versus only 10% (0.101) was due to the plant type. The influence of the plant type was not significant. Figure 7. Open in a new tab PCoA plot represents the plant leaf tissue returned from VEG-03D, E, and F on the ISS. Plant type MM is mizuna mustard, OL is ‘Outredgeous’ red romaine lettuce and WG is ‘Waldmann’s Green’ leaf lettuce.Figure 8. Open in a new tab PCoA plots represent the plant and pillow components for VEG-03D, E and F tech demonstrations performed on ISS. (A) is VEG-03D mizuna mustard, (B) is red romaine lettuce, (C) is green lettuce, (D) is VEG-03E mizuna mustard and (E) is VEG-03F red romaine lettuce.Beta diversity was also compared among the plant types to include the plant leaf and root and the Veggie pillow substrate and wick. Each crop type was considered separately within the three experiments (Figure 8). VEG-03D contained the following: one pillow with mizuna mustard (Figure 8A), two pillows with red romaine lettuce (Figure 8B) and one pillow with green leaf lettuce (Figure 8C). The PCoA of the three plant types with their associated pillow components in VEG-03D captured a high percentage of the variation within a single axis, with 67%, 76%, and 79%, respectively. The PCoAs for VEG-03D indicate that the green leaf lettuce leaf microbiome was more dissimilar from the root, wick, and substrate. However, the root and substrate were similar. Approximately 99% of the variation accounted for within the pillow sample set was due to the sample type itself (Figure 8C and Table S6). The additional two crops grown in VEG-03D displayed the same trends with root and substrate microbiomes more similar while the plant leaf microbiomes were dissimilar containing a greater amount of variation (97% and 84% for mizuna and red romaine lettuce, respectively) (Figure 8 and Table S6). In all pillow samples, the wick, which did not cluster with root and substrate, appeared to be more variable. The variation captured for the VEG-03E and F experiments was lower than seen in VEG-03D with approximately 40% of the variation explained in the first principle component for VEG-03E (Figure 8D) and approximately 50% for VEG-03F (Figure 8E). In these two experiments, the wick again appeared to have the greatest variance from other components. Leaf, root, and substrate were more similar. The R2 values for VEG-03E indicated 63% of the variation was due to the sample type, whereas in VEG-03F, 77% of the variation was attributed to the sample type. All comparisons were significant (p < 0.05) (Figure 8 and Table S6). 3.7. Community Characterization Community characterization of the pillow components and plant tissue (leaf, root, substrate, and wick) was analyzed at the genus level to determine unique and shared genera (Figure 9). There were few genera common to all four components in each of the three technical demonstrations, (VEG-03D, E, F) and ranged between one and nine genera. VEG-03D green leaf lettuce plant and pillow samples had the highest number of shared genera with nine (Figure 9A). In all three tech demos the wick component revealed a high number of unique genera between 2–19; the highest number of unique genera occurring in VEG-03E mizuna mustard pillow wicks (Figure 9B). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Venn diagrams revealing unique and shared genera across the 3 tech demos and crop types. (A) VEG-03D samples, (B) VEG-03E samples, (C) VEG-03F samples. Diagrams depict plant and corresponding pillow components (wick, substrate, and root tissue). Numbers are the number of genera with greater than 50 sequencing reads. The % is the percent total reads. Venn diagrams were completed with Venny v 2.1.Figure 9A illustrates a high number of genera shared between wick, substrate, and root tissue in VEG-03D with 26 in mizuna, 22 and 31 in red romaine lettuce, and 27 in green leaf lettuce. The number of shared genera among VEG-03E components was higher for mizuna mustard at 31 and VEG-03F had 30 shared genera between wick, substrate, and root tissue (Figure 9C). Root tissue had few unique genera, but in all crops the root had high numbers of shared genera with substrate (6–28) and between root, substrate, and wick (22–31) which included more than 40% of the genera present (Figure 9). Leaf tissue had a variable number of unique species with VEG-03D having the highest with 11 in red romaine lettuce, followed by 10 in mizuna in VEG-03E. Overall, characterization of genera in the four plant and pillow components revealed few unique species in each of the components but indicated a higher number of shared species especially among root, substrate, and wick (Figure 9). A closer inspection of the top community constituents revealed that variations in the bacterial makeup between pillow sections (wick, substrate, and root) differed from the leaf tissue (Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12). VEG-03D which included analysis of all three leafy green crops grown yielded several bacterial constituents seen in all plant types (Figure 10). These included Burkholderia, Enterobacter, Erwinia and Pseudomonas. However, there were fewer numbers of genera in leaves than in the root, wick, or substrate, which is not unexpected. There were more similar constituents in the wick, substrate, and root with Burkholderia and Novosphingobium identified in each component for all crops (Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12). The wick material appeared to present a higher variation in genera than did root or substrate. Figure 10. Open in a new tab VEG-03D technical demonstration.

Percent is based upon the abundance of sequencing reads.The VEG-03E samples and pillows returned from ISS were mizuna mustard (Figure 11) while VEG-03F were red romaine lettuce (Figure 12). Again, all samples contained Burkholderia with some samples containing up to 50% of the total abundance of sequencing reads. VEG-03E mizuna mustard pillow substrate and root tissues contained higher levels of Novosphingobium than seen in the VEG-03D tech demo. Staphylococcus was present in mizuna leaf from one VEG-03E pillow accounting for a large percent of the 15 listed and present in small fraction in the wick although was not detectable in the root or substrate. The wick material had a higher level of variability in the bacterial genera detected (Figure 11). The VEG-03F tech demo comparing red romaine lettuce plant and pillow samples showed less variation in the bacterial genera in the wick and leaf compared to VEG-03D and E. Pseudomonas which was prevalent in most wick materials in VEG-03D, E and F could also be detected in leaf tissue (Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12). Ralstonia, and Pseudomonas were also present in all samples from all three tech demos. (Figure 10 and Figure 12). Several genera were present in VEG-03D (Figure 10) and F (Figure 12) but not in E. The genera Enterobacter, Chitinophaga, Novosphingobium and Bradyrhizobium are a few that were identified in all of the Veg-03D samples as well as some of the VEG-03F samples. In VEG-03D Methylobacterium was identified in red romaine lettuce and mizuna while Janthinobacterium was identified in red romaine.4. Discussion The Veggie plant growth units deployed on the ISS have provided a platform to grow leafy greens for astronaut consumption since 2014. This series of tech demonstrations was the first time that mixed cropping was tested in Veggie, with three leafy greens. Plant growth was successful, however, there may have been an influence on growth based on plant type and position in the Veggie. It was observed in VEG 03-D that the mizuna canopy shaded the adjacent red romaine lettuce plant possibly limiting exposure to light and effecting maintenance. Germination was lower with the green leaf lettuce resulting in fewer and smaller plants. Mixed cropping could also have an impact on the transfer of plant-specific phyllosphere microbiota between crop types [14,16,20]. Microbiological food safety of Veggie-grown crops is assured by routine culture-based pathogen screening and bacterial and fungal enumeration on crops grown in ground analogs as well as samples returned from ISS. The bacterial and fungal count data and pathogen screening performed on the plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F indicates from a microbial food safety perspective, the crops are low risk to the crew. With approximately 10% of a microbial community identified with culturable methods, sequencing of both bacterial and fungal constituents provides additional identification of the community microbiota [42]. These data allow for the identification of the non-culturable microbes including the identification of beneficial microbes and microbes of concern and the confirmation of the negative culture-based screening results for E. coli and Salmonella. Many of the genera isolated and identified from the Veggie plant phyllosphere are present in terrestrially grown leafy greens. Several surveys of leafy greens revealed that Pseudomonas species dominate the phyllosphere. A study done on two types of leafy greens, rocket salad and lettuce, showed that Pseudomonas, was the most abundant genera present, followed by Pantoea, Arthrobacter and Acinetobacter [14]. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. was identified by culture independent methods on all samples except one mizuna plant in VEG-03E. Burkholderia was identified in all plant samples by culture and culture independent methods. This is in contrast with other surveys of field grown leafy greens where Burkholderia is not a dominant member of the core microbiome [14,15,16]. However, Burkholderia was found on both ISS grown and ground controls in an earlier study done on Veggie grown red romaine lettuce [28]. Bacterial counts (CFU/g) from field and hydroponic grown lettuce have been reported in the range of 4 × 104 to 2 × 108 and fungal counts (CFU/g) between 8 × 102 and 2 × 106 [43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51]. The bacterial and fungal counts on leaves of plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F were in the range of the reported values for farm or market produce counts of similar type. However, when compared to the analysis of red romaine lettuce from previous Veggie tech demos [28], the bacterial and fungal counts per gram of red romaine lettuce leaf tissue from VEG-03D and F were higher. As with previous ISS grown leafy greens [28,51] an increase in fungal counts was observed in some of the samples with repeated harvests especially in VEG-03D. VEG-03A and VEG-03D were run in the same Veggie facility (SN 002) and during plant growth, in both cases, the humidity was higher than other grow-outs. Humidity is a factor that can influence the microbial density and community in the phyllosphere and the surface of the leaf. It has been demonstrated that higher humidity and leaf wetness increases fungal abundance on plants including fungal plant pathogens [29,52,53]. The characterization of the spatial distribution of microbiota on the Veggie facility surfaces, plant growth pillows, and multi-species plant tissues was performed to elucidate possible sources and routes of transfer of microbes around the Veggie facility and plants. Generally, surface sample microbial count data showed low counts on the interior bellows surfaces, and below detection level counts mostly in VEG-03E. After harvest, the bellows are cleaned thoroughly by the crew with disinfectant wipes, perhaps minimizing microbial proliferation. The pillow surfaces had the highest counts of all surfaces sampled and are in close proximity with the moist wicking material, the plant and any plant debris which could facilitate inoculation and growth. Bacteria and fungi were recovered from the fan screen in all cases. The genera of bacteria and fungi cultured and identified have also been identified in studies to monitor the microbial profiles of the ISS. Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Aspergillus and Penicillium were all identified in an examination of ISS air filters and dust samples [54]. Several of the same genera from the previous study were isolated and identified from the ISS vacuum cleaner bag, and also included Paenibacillus, Methylobacterium, Klebsiella, and Azospirillum [55]. In addition, studies done on the microbial communities associated with surfaces on the ISS identify many of the same genera identified from the Veggie surface samples collected in this study [30,32]. We compared bacterial genera from Avila-Herrera et al. [56] comprehensive characterization of ISS surface and crew samples with the Veggie facility surfaces and leaves characterized in the current study and found 250 genera shared between the Veggie facility surfaces and ISS samples. The leaves, Veggie surfaces and ISS samples had 47 common genera suggesting microbial transfer and colonization between these locations (Figure S2). Beta diversity analysis of all plants grown in the three tech demos resulted in a tight clustering of plants from VEG-03D with the exception of one green lettuce leaf demonstrating similarity of the microbial communities within VEG-03D. VEG-03E and F grown later do not cluster tightly indicating potential diversity differences (Figure 8). These differences could be the result of many factors, including the different configuration of the three crops in each Veggie, the environmental conditions present at the time of the grow-out, i.e., temperature, CO2 and humidity, crew interaction, microbes present in the surrounding air, and irrigation water. Previous studies on field-grown leafy greens have shown that seasonal and temporal variation exists on the phyllosphere microbial communities, effected by leaf age, weather, location and soil type [14,15,57]. Unlike terrestrial agriculture, a sanitized, soilless substrate is used in Veggie to support root growth. It is aseptically packed into sterile “pillows” along with controlled release fertilizer [34]. The seeds are surface sanitized before planting, removing most epiphytes from the seed surface, and the water used to hydrate the plant pillows is relatively clean water from the ISS potable water system [35,58]. Consequently, the horticultural practices employed in Veggie may limit the sources of microbiota contributing to the development of the plant microbiome. As a whole, the phytomicrobiome is shaped and recruited by the plant from its associated habitat [3,4,6,10,59]. Rhizosphere microbiomes assemble through the selection of soil microorganisms by the production of plant root exudates [60,61,62]. The Veggie soilless substrate is essentially microbe free until the introduction of water, seed germination and exposure to the ISS environment. Water and air from the ISS have been monitored by NASA for many years and two genera commonly identified from the potable water are Burkholderia and Ralstonia [58,63]. The dominant bacterial genera in Veggie samples analyzed in this study, Burkholderia, was found across plant types and Veggie facility materials in both culture and molecular assays. The genus Burkholderia contains over 60 known species and was abundant in many of the Veggie samples, primarily in the pillow substrate, root tissue, and wicks, but in very low abundance or was absent in leaf tissue indicating the genus may have been introduced through the water source or possibly was present in the seed. Burkholderia has been identified as a potential, beneficial plant-associated microbe, however some species are implicated in human opportunistic infections [21,64,65] Ralstonia, also found in ISS water, was identified in community sequencing across all plant type roots, wicks, and substrate. Some species of Ralstonia have the potential to cause stress in plants or may be an opportunistic pathogen [66,67,68]. Pseudomonas sp., present in the top 15 genera in community sequencing in all samples but one mizuna plant and pillow from VEG-03E may be a saprophytic epi-endophyte on plant tissue [16,64,69,70,71]. It has been reported to be a potential promotor of plant growth by producing plant stimulating hormones as well as increasing disease resistance [71]. These demonstrations, D and F were completed in the same Veggie unit, SN 002, and therefore not surprising that similar microbes would be detected. Several genera were identified by sequencing in VEG-03D and F but not in E. The genera Enterobacter, Chitinophaga, Novosphingobium, and Bradyrhizobium are a few that were identified in all of the Veg-03D samples as well as some of the VEG-03F samples. Chitinophaga sp., works with certain fungal species as an endosymbiont to enhance nutrient uptake and growth [66,72]. The presence of Chitinophaga could be correlated with stress conditions and environmental disturbances [66,72]. In VEG-03D Methylobacterium was identified in red romaine and mizuna while Janthinobacterium was isolated in red romaine only. Recently it was reported that 4 strains of Methylobacterium, one a newly characterized strain, were isolated on the ISS with the Microbial Monitoring experiments [73]. Methylobacterium are involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens [74,75] and is a methylotrophic with the ability to utilize methanol produced by plants as a carbon source [76] Janthinobacterium is a soil bacterium with a wide range of metabolic activities, including antimicrobial properties and resistance to stressors such as UV radiation and cold temperatures providing a benefit to plants [77,78,79]. During the grow outs of VEG-03E and F, the genera Nevskia and Spirosoma were present in VEG-03E but not seen in VEG-03F. This could be due to a natural variation between mizuna and red romaine lettuce as each plant may have its own native microbiota, or it may have been introduced. These bacteria were detected in root and leaf samples from previous Veggie tech demos, VEG-01A, B and VEG-03A [28]. If the source of these bacteria is the water initially introduced into the soilless substrate and subsequently wicked to the seeds, this suggests possible mechanisms of transfer of water borne bacteria from the seed to the root or recruitment by the root from the surrounding substrate. An in-depth genomic analysis would have to be performed to elucidate possible sources of microbial transfer. All the bacteria cultured and identified from root samples, Burkholderia, Flavomonas, Leifsonia, Methylobacterium, Microbacterium and Rhizobium were also identified in the wick samples. Presumably, the sources of these bacteria are the ISS water, the endophytic seed population, circulating air, and/or human interaction with the plants, therefore diversity of the root microbiome could be limited by the populations in these sources. Eleven of the 12 identified isolates found on the leaf samples were not isolated from the roots, in corroboration with the 16S rRNA analysis of community comparison which revealed no shared species between the leaf and root. In the culture-based assays, 6 of the leaf-isolated bacteria were also found on the wicks. Different parts of the plant, i.e., leaves and roots support distinct microbial communities [80,81]. Patterns of genera common across the substrate, root, wicks, and leaves suggest alternate modes of bacterial and fungal transmission. For example, the substrate, roots, and wicks share the highest number of genera for all pillow sample sets tested while the leaves share a higher number of genera with the wicking material (Figure 9). This suggests the possibility of horizontal transfer of bacteria from substrate to root or the converse. The substrate starts as a sterile matrix therefore the introduction of microbes could be primarily limited to the ISS potable water, microbes within the ISS, those harbored on the Veggie surfaces, or the endophytic seed microbiota. The seed microbiome of two of the three crops, red romaine lettuce and mizuna mustard, have been investigated at KSC in numerous studies since the inception of the Veggie technology demonstrations. The microbiome of both sanitized and unsanitized seeds indicated that in all seeds, abundance of microbial communities/genera was low and the genus Thermogemmatispora predominated, and then declined post-germination., In addition, Trichodesmium and some genera of cyanobacteria were detected along with low abundance of Burkholderia, Acinetobacter, and Corynebacterium. These latter three appear to persist in the plants after germination [82]. Very few genera are shared between the leaf and substrate and the leaf and root whereas the wick has more genera in common with the leaf than the substrate and root, indicating a vertical transfer from the above “ground” wick material and the shoot of the plant. Resident microbial populations on the leaf may be transported from the ISS environment, including the circulating air and human interaction. Human associated Staphylococcus was identified on the leaves, surfaces, and wicks from cultured isolates and for 16S community sequencing, it was the dominant bacteria among the top 15 identified in one VEG-03E mizuna leaf sample. Other potential human and plant associated bacterial genera identified were Erwinia, Burkholderia, and Clavibacter. Extensive genotyping of these isolates would be required to evaluate the strain and the ability to infect the host. Four of the fungal species identified, Aspergillus spp., Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium spp., Rhodotorula spp. were found in all tech demos. In previous studies of Veggie-grown plants, Fusarium oxysporum was not found on the first growth of lettuce or surfaces of Veggie from the tech demo designated VEG-01A but has since been isolated in all subsequent tech demos [28] (unpublished data). This suggests that once bacteria or fungi become established in Veggie units and the ISS environment, unless eliminated by the cleaning and maintenance protocols, they could persist as members of the facility microbiome and consequently the plant microbiome. In conclusion, characterization of the microbiome of ISS plant growth systems and crops is critical, not only for near term assurance of crop food safety, but also for the understanding and development of sustainable crop systems for space exploration missions. Sources of external contamination, i.e., irrigation water, air, and human handling can be monitored and controlled. Strategies, such as the introduction of defined beneficial microbes to enhance plant growth and prevent human and plant pathogen invaders may need to be evaluated and implemented after careful study of the impact to these unique space agricultural systems.Acknowledgments This work was funded by the NASA Space Biology Program.

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the major concerns for long-term exploration missions beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere is consequences from exposures to solar particle event (SPE) protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). For long-term crewed Lunar and Mars explorations, the production of fresh food in space will provide both nutritional supplements and psychological benefits to the astronauts. However, the effects of space radiation on plants and plant propagules have not been sufficiently investigated and characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effect of two different compositions of charged particles-simulated GCR, and simulated SPE protons on dry and hydrated seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the crop plant Mizuna mustard [Brassica rapa var. japonica]. Exposures to charged particles, simulated GCRs (up to 80 cGy) or SPEs (up to 200 cGy), were performed either acutely or at a low dose rate using the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). Control and irradiated seeds were planted in a solid phytogel and grown in a controlled environment. Five to seven days after planting, morphological parameters were measured to evaluate radiation-induced damage in the seedlings. After exposure to single types of charged particles, as well as to simulated GCR, the hydrated Arabidopsis seeds showed dose- and quality-dependent responses, with heavier ions causing more severe defects. Seeds exposed to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had significant, although much less damage than seeds exposed to heavier and higher linear energy transfer (LET) particles. In general, the extent of damage depends on the seed type. Keywords: space radiation, galactic cosmic rays, solar particle event, Arabidopsis, mizuna mustard, seeds",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction A long-duration mission to Mars will require humans to live in space for up to 2.5 years. The distance of Mars from Earth changes with planetary physics limiting launch opportunities and preventing resupply. Consequently, food may have to be sent years ahead of the crew. Shelf-stable food systems may be five years old by the end of the mission. Under expected ambient storage conditions, critical nutrients and quality factors may degrade over this period of time [1,2]. This possibility creates a critical risk to the provision of adequate food and nutrition to support crew health and performance through such missions. Food crops grown in-mission have the potential to supplement crew nutritional requirements and to act as a psychological countermeasure for the crew by providing a familiar aspect of Earth in the isolation and confinement of deep space [3]. However, seeds and plant growth supplies may also have to be sent ahead of the crew and would need to remain viable for the length of the mission. Deep-space radiation is one of the major factors that could impact the viability of food crops. Deep-space radiation is composed primarily of protons released from large solar particle events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). GCR consists of approximately 85–90% protons, and 10–13% helium ions (alpha particles), with the remaining 1–2% consisting of high atomic number and energy (HZE) nuclei particles and electrons [4]. For future missions back to the Moon or on to Mars, astronauts and other organisms onboard these deep space missions will be exposed constantly to GCR and occasionally to protons from SPEs. Life on Earth is well protected from these components of deep-space radiation for two reasons: (1) the Earth’s global magnetic field deflects energetic charged particles, and (2) Earth’s atmosphere interacts with them resulting in attenuated energy levels and secondary particles [5]. However, during a mission beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), living organisms will be exposed to more intense deep-space radiation, in addition to secondary particles generated by the shielding materials, the atmosphere, and regolith if near the Lunar or Martian surface. During a long-term deep space mission, it is expected that crew members in space will be exposed to 1–2 mSv/day dose equivalent rate of GCR and approximately half this amount on planetary surfaces [6,7,8]. Even though the flux levels of GCR particles are very low, GCR contains high linear energy transfer (LET) particles that produce intense ionization as they penetrate through matter. Compared to low LET radiation (e.g., gamma radiation), the estimated average biological effectiveness (or the quality factor) of radiation received on the Martian surface and during transit are 3.05 and 3.82, respectively, primarily due to the Martian atmosphere [6,7,8]. The effective Mars atmospheric shielding is about 21 g/cm2, which is much thicker than the spacecraft shielding of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)’s Curiosity Rover during its transportation from Earth to Mars [7,8]. For Lunar missions, there is no atmospheric shielding effect. Using data obtained during the MSL mission, it was estimated that a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 Sv would be experienced during a round trip Mars surface mission consisting of a 180-day transit (each way) and 500 days on the Martian surface with solar activity similar to that of 2011–2012 [7,8]. For plant seeds, these dose equivalent rates and quality factors may not be applicable because they refer to the biological effectiveness of a given absorbed dose of a specific type of radiation based on human tissue responses. Therefore, in this study, we designed the experiment based on the measurements of the absorbed dose during the MSL mission, which is 400–560 µGy/day during transit and 170–250 µGy/day on the Martian surface at the Gale crater region [7,8]. At the cellular level, radiation induces DNA damage, which to some extent is successfully handled by cellular repair machinery. To counteract DNA damage, a network of cellular pathways, defined as the DNA damage response (DDR) network, mitigates DNA damage by detecting and repairing DNA lesions. These mechanisms consist of cell-cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The basic DDR networks in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are similar, but significant differences exist in the radiosensitivity among different species and the mechanisms that allow access to the lesions by repair enzymes [9]. Plants share many features of chromatin organization and DNA repair with fungi and animals [9,10]. Numerous studies have shown that the effect of ionizing radiation on plants depends upon species, cultivar, development stage, tissue architecture and genome organization, as well as radiation features, e.g., quality, dose, and duration of exposure [11]. Plant seeds have been flown on the ISS and on other venues beyond LEO [12,13,14], however, the radiation environment reported in most of these published studies is not comparable to deep- space radiation, neither in quality nor quantity. Therefore, whether crop seeds, plant growth, and produce quality are significantly affected by long-term exposure to deep-space radiation has yet to be adequately investigated and characterized. Although current Earth-based radiation facilities can only approximately reproduce the space-radiation environment, recent improvements in technology can be utilized to improve our knowledge about the effect of space radiation on crop plants [15]. This information would in turn address the question of whether fresh food production could provide an important nutritional and psychological contribution on long-duration missions. In this study, two types of plant seeds were included. The first were seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism that does not have properties that would contribute to a bioregenerative or food capability, but which is currently the most extensively studied plant in spaceflight [16] partially due to the availability of its whole genome sequence and a wide range of genetically modified strains. The second were seeds from an edible mustard plant, Mizuna, Brassica rapa var. japonica, which has been identified as a candidate space crop and grown for research and crew consumption on the International Space Station (ISS) [17,18,19,20]. Seeds from both species were irradiated, and subsequently planted and grown to seedlings to demonstrate the impact of the space radiation environment on seeds and their ability to germinate and develop. The range of outcomes between Arabidopsis and Mizuna indicates the potential challenges with transferring model organism information to usable systems, and a need to focus research on crops most likely to contribute to spaceflight missions.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Plants Seeds of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0, and Mizuna (Brassica rapa var. japonica), a mustard leafy green, were used for this study. Arabidopsis thaliana has been widely used as a model plant organism for microgravity research. Arabidopsis seeds were obtained from in-house culture, while Mizuna seeds were purchased from Johnny’s Selected Seeds (Waterville, ME, USA). 2.2. Radiation Scenarios Selected radiation scenarios are summarized in Table 1. Seeds, dry or imbibed, were exposed to protons and titanium ions individually, or using two simulated GCR scenarios (GCR1 or GCR2) and one simulated SPE event. For both GCR scenarios, ions including protons, helium, oxygen, titanium or silicon, and iron were sequentially delivered. GCR1 was a complex mixed radiation field with a similar spectrum of particles identified in GCR. This simulation was designed by Dr. Hada’s team and generated after the above primary beams passed through 20 g/cm2 aluminum and high-density polyethylene at 10.345 g/cm2 [21]. Under the GCR1 environment, seeds were exposed to a mixture of non-directional secondary particles in which 250 MeV/n protons predominated [21]. The GCR2 scenario was a standard GCR simulation scenario provided by the NSRL physics team for space-radiation risk assessment research without the shielding material [22]. Simulated SPE exposure was achieved using sequential exposures to protons with a broad energy range of 50–150 MeV/n, simulating the August 1972 SPE event [22,23]. Exposures to all radiation scenarios were conducted acutely (within minutes for each single beam, leading to a total of about 20 min. for all particle components) or at a relatively low dose rate (LDR) over a 2–4 h time period (Table 1).

Preparation of Seeds for Irradiation and Growth Study Mizuna seeds were sanitized by 1 h-hypochlorite fuming (30 mL bleach: 0.5 mL HCL) [24,25], while Arabidopsis seeds were sanitized using a standard 70% ethanol method [24]. Sanitized dry seeds for each condition were then transferred to packets prepared from sterile germination paper. For imbibed seed treatments, twenty-four hours before irradiation, 0.9 mL of water was added to each packet to imbibe the seeds, and seed packets with imbibed seeds were then wrapped with several more layers of brown kraft paper sheet to prevent light exposure. All the seed packets, each containing about 25 dry or imbibed seeds, were kept in the dark at approximately 4 °C in a refrigerator, except during the periods of actual or sham (i.e., for controls) radiation exposures when both irradiated and control seed packets were still in the dark, but at room temperature. Depending on the experimental conditions (Table 1), 26–72 dry or 24 h-imbibed Arabidopsis and Mizuna seeds were subject to each radiation exposure treatment, while similar numbers of seeds were retained as non-irradiated controls for comparison with acute or LDR irradiated seeds. For evaluating germination and early seedling development, two days after irradiation, control and irradiated seeds were planted onto a 0.5% Murishige and Skoog (MS) phytogel media either individually within a pipette tip holder (titanium, proton, and GCR1 experiments) or six to twelve seeds within a 10 cm × 10 cm Petri plate (GCR2 and SPE experiments) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Growth conditions approximating those on the ISS (except for CO2 concentration) were maintained in a controlled environment chamber (22 °C, 40–45% RH, 150 μmol·m2·s−1 light, ambient CO2 at about 400 ppm, 16 h/8 h photoperiod). Seedlings were harvested at 6–7 days after planting (DAP) for Arabidopsis, and 5 DAP for Mizuna for morphological analyses. Images were acquired for evaluating signs of stress and deformation. Seeds were defined as having germinated upon observation of any early sign of germination, including seed coat rupture and radicle emergence. For purposes of assessing viability rates in seeds exposed to Ti-ion exposure, non-germinated seeds as well as germinated seeds without cotyledons, or with radical emergence or showing severely deformed cotyledons without sign of true leaf development were considered non-viable. Imagery analysis for determining cotyledon deformation was conducted only for Ti-ion irradiated Arabidopsis seedlings and mizuna experiments. In the titanium-ion irradiation experiment, deformation data were obtained for all seedlings; however, root length measurements for several seedlings were missing due to their roots being broken during the harvest. As a result, the number of plants available for analysis of root length was fewer than the number with deformation data for the titanium-ion experiment. Root length was measured using Rootnav v1.8.1 and Image J software. Root length data are presented in millimeters. 2.4. Mathematical Simulation and Radiation Track Analysis The simulations were conducted with the code RITRACKS [26]. Briefly, a simulation volume is defined, and its base is irradiated by n tracks. The number of tracks is determined from sampling of the Poisson distribution, p(n) = λn e−λ/n!, where λ = ϕA is the average number of tracks, A is the area of the irradiated volume surface, and ϕ is obtained from a given dose D using the well-known equation, D(Gy) = 1.6 × 109 ϕ(cm−2) × LET(keV/μm). (1) The LET of a particle is calculated using the Bethe’s equation, with corrections [27]. To mimic the contributions of energy deposition from electron tracks of neighboring volumes, periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) were used. Briefly, the electrons that leave the irradiated volume are put back on the opposite side, with the same energy and direction vector [28]. 2.5. Statistical Analysis For discrete outcomes, such as viability, germination or deformed cotyledon counts, Fisher’s exact test was used to compare radiation exposure methods (control, acute, or low-dose rate) or to compare doses within each radiation scenario. For comparisons with root length as an outcome, quantile regression was used to compare medians, taking into account the possibility of non-germination and the generally left-skewed distribution of root lengths even if germination had occurred. For defining median root length, non-germination was treated as a length of zero. In other words, a median length of x0 is taken to mean 50% of plants had root lengths > x0, while the other 50% either did not germinate or if they did, had lengths < x0.",

Effect of Titanium Ion and Proton Exposure on Imbibed Arabidopsis Seeds Irradiation of imbibed Arabidopsis seeds was delivered acutely (within minutes), or over a longer duration at a low dose rate (LDR) of 0.166 cGy/min for 40 cGy 300 MeV/n titanium ions (Ti), or 40 cGy 250 MeV/n protons. Mathematical simulations showed that the fluence of these particles over an Arabidopsis embryo reached 1750 to 2000 hits/seed for titanium ions (approximately 0.5 hits/cell) and over 800,000 hits/seed for protons (approximately over 200 hits/cell). Examples of simulated Ti, proton, and simulated GCR1 and 2 particle tracks within the volume of one cell (12 μm × 12 μm × 12 μm) are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.

In addition, there were obvious increases in the percentage of cotyledon deformation in the irradiated groups (Figure 2A right panel, Figure 2D). Furthermore (Figure 2A, right panel), exposure to titanium ions had a noticeable effect on root development alone, with no measurable roots in 13 of 25 (52%) germinated seeds (LDR group) as compared with 8 of 25 (32%) seeds (acute group) and only 1 of 28 (3.6%) seeds (control group) (p < 0.001, Fisher exact test).

(D) Examples of cotyledon deformation. * Indicates p < 0.05 compared to controls.Overall, the distribution of root length in seedlings was shifted downwards (Figure 2C) relative to the control distribution in the two irradiated groups with median lengths of 22.2, 6.4, and 0 mm, for the control, acute, and LDR groups respectively. (The median length was zero for the LDR group because for more than half (14 of 27) of these seeds, germination did not occur or roots did not develop to the point where they were measurable). Even when comparing the upper parts of the root length distribution, we observed a similar pattern; for example, 75th-percentile root lengths were 24, 19, and 14 mm for control, acute, and LDR groups, respectively (Figure 2B). Similarly, when considering only plants with measurable root lengths, estimated median root length ± 1SE was 22.2 ± 2.8 mm for control seeds, decreasing to 17.3 ± 3.0 mm after acute exposure and to 9.5 ± 3.1 mm (LDR exposure). Exposure to protons had virtually no effect on the ability of seeds to germinate with more than 90% germination rates for all experimental conditions: control seeds (98%, 55/56), acute exposure (95%, 38/40), and LDR exposure (92.8%, 39/42) (Figure 3A). However estimated median root lengths differed markedly between the experimental groups: (F(2, 135) = 38.4; p < 0.0001). Estimates of median lengths and standard errors were: 24.1 ± 0.6 mm (control), 16.7 ± 0.7 mm (acute exposure), and 18.6 ± 0.6 mm (LDR exposure) (Figure 3B). Figure 3C shows the effects of irradiation on the distribution of root lengths in plants from germinated seeds. Furthermore, exposure to protons, as low as 20 cGy (data not shown), also resulted in significantly shorter and more under-developed roots without obvious deformation of leaf and root tissue. These results suggest that SPEs, which contain protons with a broad energy spectrum, may have a potential impact on plant growth after germination as was also seen for GCR exposures (next section).

Effect of GCR-1 Scenario on Imbibed Arabidopsis Seeds About 85% of imbibed Arabidopsis seeds germinated in all treatment groups, regardless of exposure to CGR1 radiation (Figure 4A). The relatively large number of non-germinated seeds (six in each group) resulted in a loss of power to discriminate between treatment groups with respect to median root length. Median root lengths were similar for control plants and for plants grown from seeds exposed to simulated acute or LDR GCR1 radiation at 29 cGy, but appeared reduced after exposure to 59 cGy GCR1 radiation (Figure 4B). Considering only the germinated seeds, the median root lengths of plants from seeds exposed to acute 59 cGy GCR1 radiation were noticeably shorter (median length = 15.7 mm as compared with controls, median length = 19.8 mm; p = 0.007). The distribution of the root length data from germinated seeds is displayed in Figure 4C. Figure 4.

Effect of GCR2 on Dry Arabidopsis and Mizuna Seeds Dry Arabidopsis and Mizuna seeds were exposed to GCR2 radiation, a simplified and standard six-beam simulation scenario recommended by the NSRL, rather than the GCR1 scenario, which generated a much more complex radiation field for post-irradiation analysis. For Arabidopsis seeds, the effect of GCR2 radiation was negligible in that 401 of the 406 seeds planted germinated with notable root development (Figure 5A). For LDR exposure, estimated median root lengths were virtually the same for all dose groups. For acute exposure, there was only a slight indication of a tendency for plants to have degraded root lengths (p = 0.04, p = 0.02 for doses of 40 and 80 cGy respectively; Figure 5B). In the case of Mizuna, although virtually all seeds (356 of 360) also germinated with root development (Figure 5C), we observed evidence of an acute irradiation effect on the incidence of plants with deformed leaves, with 7 of 59 (11.9%) control plants having deformed leaves (control), as compared with 23 of 59 (39.0%) and 14 of 59 (23.7%) for 40 cGy and 80 cGy exposures (p = 0.003, Fisher exact test) (Figure 5D). No such effect was seen after LDR exposure. Similarly, we observed a 17% reduction in median root length of Mizuna plants after acute irradiation compared to the control (95% conf (-27.6%, -7.4%), p = 0.001), whereas there was no noticeable effect of LDR irradiation on root length (Figure 5E).

Effect of SPE on Imbibed Arabidopsis and Mizuna For imbibed Arabidopsis seeds, there was no noticeable effect of simulated-SPE dose on percentages of germination) for either acute or LDR exposures (Figure 6A) or on median root length (p = 0.35 and p = 0.06, comparing all doses, Acute and LDR respectively) (Figure 6B). However, for imbibed Mizuna seeds exposed to acute simulated SPE radiation (Figure 6C), percentages of negative outcomes (non-germinated seeds or plants with deformed cotyledon structure) tended to increase with dose (Fisher’s exact test comparing all doses including control; p = 0.0011, Figure 6D). For LDR exposure, percentages of negative outcomes also tended to increase with dose, however the effect was not as striking (Figure 6C, Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.034). There was no noticeable effect of dose on median root length for either type of exposure (p = 0.40 and p = 0.97, comparing all doses, acute and LDR respectively) (Figure 6E). Figure 6.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion For future missions back to the Moon or on to Mars, living organisms will be exposed constantly to GCR and occasionally to particles from large solar particle events (SPE), even with effective shielding from the structural materials of vehicles, surface bases, the Martian atmosphere, and the Moon and Mars themselves. Transit vehicles will include protected spaces for astronauts with significantly heavier shielding; however, there are currently no requirements being developed for shielding plant growth or seed storage areas, not only for transit vehicles, but also for Lunar or Martian surface bases. Our study focused on anticipated radiation exposure for long-duration deep space missions such as a 3-year Mars mission. Table 2 summarizes estimates of total GCR dose equivalent rates for different space environments [6,7,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36]. For comparison purposes and due to the availability of the data, we presented the dose equivalent rates in Table 2 even though these dose equivalent rates were estimated based on human biological effectiveness, which may not be applicable to plants. Table 2. GCR dose equivalent rate (mSv/day) at different locations.

For our study, we used 40 cGy to simulate the total GCR dose expected to be experienced during a 3-year Mars mission based on the measurements from the MSL Curiosity Rover Mission during 2011–2012 [7,8]. We also chose a higher dose point of 80 cGy for all simulated GCR irradiation experiments to evaluate the dose response and possible maximum GCR impact on seeds. For some experiments, 20 cGy exposures were used as well. Compared to GCR, the occurrence time, duration, and fluence of an SPE are not predictable. Therefore, for the SPE simulation, we used the model developed by the NSRL based on combining characteristics of two large historical events, namely the fluence of the August 1972 event along with an energy spectrum similar to the March 1989 event [22,23]. We selected three dose points, 40, 80, and 200 cGy, based on the estimated skin doses with 5 g/cm2 to 20 g/cm2 shielding during the August 1972 SPE [37]. These dose points allow us to determine potential dose response and compare it with the GCR effects. Our study investigated two fundamental questions: (1) whether deep space GCR or SPE protons impacts plant seeds and their growth, and (2) which factors such as species, dose, dose rate, particle type, or some combination of these produce the most detrimental effects. Seeds received either acute exposure within 10–15 min (40–50 mGy/min), or relatively LDR exposures (1.66–3.33 mGy/min and 4.44 mGy/min for GCR and SPE, respectively). Due to facility constraints, the resulting LDR dose for simulated GCR is higher than the dose rate in deep space, but chronic exposure is more relevant in deep-space scenarios than is acute exposure. 4.1. Charged Particle Exposure and Hydrated Arabidopsis Seeds In the first part of this study, we chose hydrated Arabidopsis seeds to expose to various single particles (protons and titanium ions), as well as the more complex GCR1 scenario. The GCR1 scenario was developed by Dr. Hada’s group [21] using sequential primary beams and shielding materials to generate a complex mixed radiation field. This was the first time a simulated GCR scenario has been utilized for plant research. Hydrated seeds contain growing embryos that are presumably more sensitive to radiation damage than dry seeds and mature plants, therefore, we expected the radiation impact, if any, would be shown in these hydrated seeds. In our study, the seeds were hydrated 24 h before irradiation and maintained at 4 °C in the dark. This experimental condition was developed to maintain the seeds in a hydrated, but still relatively dormant stage, to avoid the influence of environmental fluctuations that might interfere with the seeds’ responses to radiation. In particular, temperature can affect both the germination process and DNA repair efficiency. Another factor is the light level that hydrated seeds are exposed to before, during, and after irradiation. Light regimes have been shown to dictate the specific activation and efficiency of some DNA repair pathways such as recombination or photo-repair in various plants [38,39,40]. In this study, we maintained all dry and hydrated samples in the dark to avoid the effects of different light regimes, which may generate significant variations among different samples and experiments. Exposure of hydrated seeds to these radiation scenarios had little impact on the rate of any signs of germination (including seed coat rupture), which is consistent with other studies. However, morphological changes, especially on root length measurements, of the seedlings cultured from irradiated seeds were found to be dose- and quality-dependent, suggesting that heavier ions cause more severe damage (Figure 7). Because of logistical constraints, we only evaluated seeds subjected to a 24-h imbibition interval. It is possible that at different growing stages with rapidly dividing and differentiating cells of different plant organs, seedlings may show different radiosensitivities [41,42]. The possibility of differential effects of irradiation depending on growth stage needs to be tested further. Figure 7. Open in a new tab A plot of estimated ratios (treatment to control) of median root length (proton and CGR) or 75th percentiles (Ti) along with 95% confidence intervals showing that the Arabidopsis seedlings from irradiated seeds generally have shortened root length. Larger uncertainties for Ti exposure reflect the smaller sample size as well as the failure of many seeds to germinate or produce measurable roots. * Indicates p < 0.05 compared to controls. 4.2. Space Mission Relevant Experiments In actual deep space radiation scenarios, GCR presents a constant extremely low dose rate background radiation field. Because seed imbibition occurs over a relatively short interval (hours to days depending on seed types), maximum cumulative GCR dose during imbibition is expected to be at the milligray range for a 10-day exposure. Therefore, protons released from a large SPE, typically delivered within a couple of days, pose a more significant impact for imbibed seeds than GCR exposure. On the other hand, dry seeds in long-term storage during deep space missions would be exposed to a much higher accumulative GCR dose, which may affect seed viability over long-duration missions. Therefore, we evaluated GCR impact on dry seeds of Arabidopsis and Mizuna, and SPE effect on imbibed seeds. For dry Arabidopsis seeds, the GCR-2 scenario did not cause significant changes in germination, viability, or morphology. Root length was impacted more in imbibed seeds by exposure to GCR1 (59 cGy) than in dry seeds by exposure to GCR2 (80 cGy), indicating hydrated seeds are more sensitive to radiation damage as expected. Furthermore, radiation quality plays an important role because 250 MeV/n proton (40 cGy) showed more significant impact on hydrated Arabidopsis seeds than simulated SPE (40 cGy) with spectra ranging from 50 to 150 MeV/n, even though both radiation scenarios cause shortened root length. Interestingly, in Mizuna seeds, for the first time, we found a significantly increased abnormality rate in the seedlings developed from both GCR2 and SPE irradiated dry seeds. In contrast to Arabidopsis seeds, dry Mizuna seeds showed an increase in cotyledon deformation with increasing levels of acute GCR2 exposure. This difference between species highlights the need to identify and focus research on crops most likely to contribute to spaceflight missions, as outcomes from model organisms are not universal and may not be applicable. Increased cotyledon deformation was not significant following LDR, indicating potential activation of DNA repair mechanisms. Further evaluation of various crops may help to identify those most resistant to DNA damage and enable identification and screening for the most efficient repair mechanisms. 4.3. Comparison with Other Studies Numerous studies have shown that the effects of ionizing radiation on plants are significantly influenced by species, cultivar, development stage, tissue architecture and genome organization, as well as radiation features, e.g., quality, dose, and duration of exposure [11]. However, very few of these studies used radiation fields that are comparable to deep space radiation in quality and quantity. Plant seeds have been flown on the ISS and beyond LEO spaceflight missions [12,13,14], which are mostly short-duration experiments. There have been several long-duration exposures of seeds to the space environment using different platforms such as the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) facility, the EXPOSE facility, and the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). MISSE and EXPOSE are multi-user facilities designed to operate outside of the ISS. The LDEF was deployed to low-Earth orbit (LEO) at approximately 250 nautical miles in 1984 and had orbited the Earth for about 5.7 years. It was retrieved in 1990 at about 178 nautical miles. At present, MISSE and EXPOSE are still operational. The reports of these studies are not quite consistent. In a 27-month EXPOSE-R experiment stationed outside the ISS, analysis of the germination results revealed that the tomato seeds did not survive the exposure to radiation with or without UV. Arabidopsis seeds survived only in a dark layer shielded from UV exposure and were able to germinate and further develop [43]. In another report from Tepfer et al. [44], the EXPOSE-R exposure (without UV) significantly reduced the germination rate of seeds from two wild type Arabidopsis lines: Columbia (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (Ws-2), with Ws-2 showing more sensitivity to space radiation exposure than Col-0. DNA degradation was found in the seeds exposed to UV, but not significantly in those shielded from UV exposure [44]. In contrast, under a different space environmental condition in the LDEF flight, tomato seeds maintained at a controlled climate of 14 psi with 15% humidity at an altitude between 175 to 275 nautical miles only showed that the pores of the strophiole region of the flight seeds were larger in size than those in the ground control seeds, which might affect germination [12]. For other space radiation related research platforms, in a very recent experiment using the Cosmic Ray Exposure Sequencing Science (CRESS) payload system, a 1U CubeSat design, Arabidopsis seeds (under 1 atm) were exposed to the stratosphere (36–40 km) environment above Antarctica in a 30-day, long-duration high altitude balloon mission [45]. In a parallel experiment, dry seeds were exposed to a 40 cGy GCR1 simulation at NSRL. GCR and stratosphere exposed seeds showed significantly reduced germination rates of 76.4% and 82.5%, respectively compared to 98% for the controls. Significantly elevated somatic mutation rates (and developmental aberrations) were also revealed in these GCR or stratosphere exposed seeds with the GCR exposure generating significantly higher mutation rates than that of Antarctica. These mutations also resulted in the death or delayed growth of certain plant organs. Heritable mutations were found in the second generation of the GCR irradiated seeds [45]. DNA damage, degradation, and mutation are the major findings of radiation impacts on seeds and plants in many studies [9,10,11,44,45]. Further investigations are needed to fully characterize DNA damage and DNA damage repair in response to space radiation, as well as the multigenerational effects. In addition to flight studies, numerous ground radiation studies have been conducted using ground-based radiation sources. Many of these studies did not target space exploration but aimed to evaluate impacts of radiation accidents on the environment, as well as using radiation as a tool to generate desired mutations to benefit agriculture. Among these studies, those conducted in highly contaminated radiation background areas at a dose rate relevant to deep space are particularly of interest. Many studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of chronic low-dose rate exposure on biological organisms including plants. Some have reported significant genotypic and phenotypic changes in plants within the exclusion zone with a relatively low dose-rate [46,47,48]. In general, our findings are in agreement with these studies, and by using ground based GCR and SPE simulations, we provided further evidence that space radiation exposures affect both dry and imbibed seeds.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions and Future Work In our study, we have confirmed for the first-time ground-based simulation of GCR and SPE has an impact on Arabidopsis and Mizuna seeds. We observed dependence of outcome measures on dose, dose rate, and radiation quality, with heavier ions causing more severe damage. Exposures to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had much less effect compared to exposures to heavier and higher LET particles, but there were significant impacts that appear to be dependent on the seed type. As expected, hydrated seeds were more sensitive to radiation exposure than were dry seeds. Complementary to the results we presented here, it is very important to understand the cellular and molecular basis of these findings. Numerous parameters can be evaluated in future studies to provide deeper insights in the mechanisms behind these reported findings, from analyzing relative sizes and cellular organization of the apical meristem and elongation zone, to conducting multi-omics analyses. Plant DNA damage response and repair mechanisms in response to space radiation also need to be fully characterized. To this end, we are currently conducting an RNAseq analysis using the harvested seedling samples from this study. In addition, we are in the process of evaluating the degree to which GCR and SPE radiation exposures affect the ability of seeds of mizuna, lettuce, and tomato to develop into adult plants and edible fresh produce. In space, plant seeds are exposed to multiple space environmental factors, such as altered gravity, suboptimal growth conditions including water stress, high CO2 and environmental volatile organic compound (VOC) levels, ethylene generation, and altered air pressure that may cause stress and impact plant growth. Furthermore, plants developed from sanitized seeds may be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens from the unique microbiome of a transit vehicle. The space radiation environment may further impair the ability of seeds and plants to adapt to these environmental challenges during long-duration missions. In order to support successful integration of fresh food production systems in future spaceflight missions, more studies need to be conducted to understand radiation impacts on a wider variety of space crop candidates and other developmental stages in the plant life cycle, such as young seedling growth, embryogenesis, and seed maturation. More studies are also needed to identify physical or biological methods that efficiently protect or repair seeds from deep space radiation.",

Copyright notice ID: 8879990 PMID: 35207432 Abstract One of the major concerns for long-term exploration missions beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere is consequences from exposures to solar particle event (SPE) protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). For long-term crewed Lunar and Mars explorations, the production of fresh food in space will provide both nutritional supplements and psychological benefits to the astronauts. However, the effects of space radiation on plants and plant propagules have not been sufficiently investigated and characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effect of two different compositions of charged particles-simulated GCR, and simulated SPE protons on dry and hydrated seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the crop plant Mizuna mustard [Brassica rapa var. japonica]. Exposures to charged particles, simulated GCRs (up to 80 cGy) or SPEs (up to 200 cGy), were performed either acutely or at a low dose rate using the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). Control and irradiated seeds were planted in a solid phytogel and grown in a controlled environment. Five to seven days after planting, morphological parameters were measured to evaluate radiation-induced damage in the seedlings. After exposure to single types of charged particles, as well as to simulated GCR, the hydrated Arabidopsis seeds showed dose- and quality-dependent responses, with heavier ions causing more severe defects. Seeds exposed to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had significant, although much less damage than seeds exposed to heavier and higher linear energy transfer (LET) particles. In general, the extent of damage depends on the seed type. Keywords: space radiation, galactic cosmic rays, solar particle event, Arabidopsis, mizuna mustard, seeds1. Introduction A long-duration mission to Mars will require humans to live in space for up to 2.5 years. The distance of Mars from Earth changes with planetary physics limiting launch opportunities and preventing resupply. Consequently, food may have to be sent years ahead of the crew. Shelf-stable food systems may be five years old by the end of the mission. Under expected ambient storage conditions, critical nutrients and quality factors may degrade over this period of time [1,2]. This possibility creates a critical risk to the provision of adequate food and nutrition to support crew health and performance through such missions. Food crops grown in-mission have the potential to supplement crew nutritional requirements and to act as a psychological countermeasure for the crew by providing a familiar aspect of Earth in the isolation and confinement of deep space [3]. However, seeds and plant growth supplies may also have to be sent ahead of the crew and would need to remain viable for the length of the mission. Deep-space radiation is one of the major factors that could impact the viability of food crops. Deep-space radiation is composed primarily of protons released from large solar particle events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). GCR consists of approximately 85–90% protons, and 10–13% helium ions (alpha particles), with the remaining 1–2% consisting of high atomic number and energy (HZE) nuclei particles and electrons [4]. For future missions back to the Moon or on to Mars, astronauts and other organisms onboard these deep space missions will be exposed constantly to GCR and occasionally to protons from SPEs. Life on Earth is well protected from these components of deep-space radiation for two reasons: (1) the Earth’s global magnetic field deflects energetic charged particles, and (2) Earth’s atmosphere interacts with them resulting in attenuated energy levels and secondary particles [5]. However, during a mission beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), living organisms will be exposed to more intense deep-space radiation, in addition to secondary particles generated by the shielding materials, the atmosphere, and regolith if near the Lunar or Martian surface. During a long-term deep space mission, it is expected that crew members in space will be exposed to 1–2 mSv/day dose equivalent rate of GCR and approximately half this amount on planetary surfaces [6,7,8]. Even though the flux levels of GCR particles are very low, GCR contains high linear energy transfer (LET) particles that produce intense ionization as they penetrate through matter. Compared to low LET radiation (e.g., gamma radiation), the estimated average biological effectiveness (or the quality factor) of radiation received on the Martian surface and during transit are 3.05 and 3.82, respectively, primarily due to the Martian atmosphere [6,7,8]. The effective Mars atmospheric shielding is about 21 g/cm2, which is much thicker than the spacecraft shielding of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)’s Curiosity Rover during its transportation from Earth to Mars [7,8]. For Lunar missions, there is no atmospheric shielding effect. Using data obtained during the MSL mission, it was estimated that a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 Sv would be experienced during a round trip Mars surface mission consisting of a 180-day transit (each way) and 500 days on the Martian surface with solar activity similar to that of 2011–2012 [7,8]. For plant seeds, these dose equivalent rates and quality factors may not be applicable because they refer to the biological effectiveness of a given absorbed dose of a specific type of radiation based on human tissue responses. Therefore, in this study, we designed the experiment based on the measurements of the absorbed dose during the MSL mission, which is 400–560 µGy/day during transit and 170–250 µGy/day on the Martian surface at the Gale crater region [7,8]. At the cellular level, radiation induces DNA damage, which to some extent is successfully handled by cellular repair machinery. To counteract DNA damage, a network of cellular pathways, defined as the DNA damage response (DDR) network, mitigates DNA damage by detecting and repairing DNA lesions. These mechanisms consist of cell-cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The basic DDR networks in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are similar, but significant differences exist in the radiosensitivity among different species and the mechanisms that allow access to the lesions by repair enzymes [9]. Plants share many features of chromatin organization and DNA repair with fungi and animals [9,10]. Numerous studies have shown that the effect of ionizing radiation on plants depends upon species, cultivar, development stage, tissue architecture and genome organization, as well as radiation features, e.g., quality, dose, and duration of exposure [11]. Plant seeds have been flown on the ISS and on other venues beyond LEO [12,13,14], however, the radiation environment reported in most of these published studies is not comparable to deep- space radiation, neither in quality nor quantity. Therefore, whether crop seeds, plant growth, and produce quality are significantly affected by long-term exposure to deep-space radiation has yet to be adequately investigated and characterized. Although current Earth-based radiation facilities can only approximately reproduce the space-radiation environment, recent improvements in technology can be utilized to improve our knowledge about the effect of space radiation on crop plants [15]. This information would in turn address the question of whether fresh food production could provide an important nutritional and psychological contribution on long-duration missions. In this study, two types of plant seeds were included. The first were seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism that does not have properties that would contribute to a bioregenerative or food capability, but which is currently the most extensively studied plant in spaceflight [16] partially due to the availability of its whole genome sequence and a wide range of genetically modified strains. The second were seeds from an edible mustard plant, Mizuna, Brassica rapa var. japonica, which has been identified as a candidate space crop and grown for research and crew consumption on the International Space Station (ISS) [17,18,19,20]. Seeds from both species were irradiated, and subsequently planted and grown to seedlings to demonstrate the impact of the space radiation environment on seeds and their ability to germinate and develop. The range of outcomes between Arabidopsis and Mizuna indicates the potential challenges with transferring model organism information to usable systems, and a need to focus research on crops most likely to contribute to spaceflight missions.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Plants Seeds of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0, and Mizuna (Brassica rapa var. japonica), a mustard leafy green, were used for this study. Arabidopsis thaliana has been widely used as a model plant organism for microgravity research. Arabidopsis seeds were obtained from in-house culture, while Mizuna seeds were purchased from Johnny’s Selected Seeds (Waterville, ME, USA).2.2. Radiation Scenarios Selected radiation scenarios are summarized in Table 1. Seeds, dry or imbibed, were exposed to protons and titanium ions individually, or using two simulated GCR scenarios (GCR1 or GCR2) and one simulated SPE event. For both GCR scenarios, ions including protons, helium, oxygen, titanium or silicon, and iron were sequentially delivered. GCR1 was a complex mixed radiation field with a similar spectrum of particles identified in GCR. This simulation was designed by Dr. Hada’s team and generated after the above primary beams passed through 20 g/cm2 aluminum and high-density polyethylene at 10.345 g/cm2 [21]. Under the GCR1 environment, seeds were exposed to a mixture of non-directional secondary particles in which 250 MeV/n protons predominated [21]. The GCR2 scenario was a standard GCR simulation scenario provided by the NSRL physics team for space-radiation risk assessment research without the shielding material [22]. Simulated SPE exposure was achieved using sequential exposures to protons with a broad energy range of 50–150 MeV/n, simulating the August 1972 SPE event [22,23]. Exposures to all radiation scenarios were conducted acutely (within minutes for each single beam, leading to a total of about 20 min. for all particle components) or at a relatively low dose rate (LDR) over a 2–4 h time period (Table 1).

Preparation of Seeds for Irradiation and Growth Study Mizuna seeds were sanitized by 1 h-hypochlorite fuming (30 mL bleach: 0.5 mL HCL) [24,25], while Arabidopsis seeds were sanitized using a standard 70% ethanol method [24]. Sanitized dry seeds for each condition were then transferred to packets prepared from sterile germination paper. For imbibed seed treatments, twenty-four hours before irradiation, 0.9 mL of water was added to each packet to imbibe the seeds, and seed packets with imbibed seeds were then wrapped with several more layers of brown kraft paper sheet to prevent light exposure. All the seed packets, each containing about 25 dry or imbibed seeds, were kept in the dark at approximately 4 °C in a refrigerator, except during the periods of actual or sham (i.e., for controls) radiation exposures when both irradiated and control seed packets were still in the dark, but at room temperature. Depending on the experimental conditions (Table 1), 26–72 dry or 24 h-imbibed Arabidopsis and Mizuna seeds were subject to each radiation exposure treatment, while similar numbers of seeds were retained as non-irradiated controls for comparison with acute or LDR irradiated seeds. For evaluating germination and early seedling development, two days after irradiation, control and irradiated seeds were planted onto a 0.5% Murishige and Skoog (MS) phytogel media either individually within a pipette tip holder (titanium, proton, and GCR1 experiments) or six to twelve seeds within a 10 cm × 10 cm Petri plate (GCR2 and SPE experiments) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Growth conditions approximating those on the ISS (except for CO2 concentration) were maintained in a controlled environment chamber (22 °C, 40–45% RH, 150 μmol·m2·s−1 light, ambient CO2 at about 400 ppm, 16 h/8 h photoperiod). Seedlings were harvested at 6–7 days after planting (DAP) for Arabidopsis, and 5 DAP for Mizuna for morphological analyses. Images were acquired for evaluating signs of stress and deformation. Seeds were defined as having germinated upon observation of any early sign of germination, including seed coat rupture and radicle emergence. For purposes of assessing viability rates in seeds exposed to Ti-ion exposure, non-germinated seeds as well as germinated seeds without cotyledons, or with radical emergence or showing severely deformed cotyledons without sign of true leaf development were considered non-viable. Imagery analysis for determining cotyledon deformation was conducted only for Ti-ion irradiated Arabidopsis seedlings and mizuna experiments. In the titanium-ion irradiation experiment, deformation data were obtained for all seedlings; however, root length measurements for several seedlings were missing due to their roots being broken during the harvest. As a result, the number of plants available for analysis of root length was fewer than the number with deformation data for the titanium-ion experiment. Root length was measured using Rootnav v1.8.1 and Image J software. Root length data are presented in millimeters.2.4. Mathematical Simulation and Radiation Track Analysis The simulations were conducted with the code RITRACKS [26]. Briefly, a simulation volume is defined, and its base is irradiated by n tracks. The number of tracks is determined from sampling of the Poisson distribution, p(n) = λn e−λ/n!, where λ = ϕA is the average number of tracks, A is the area of the irradiated volume surface, and ϕ is obtained from a given dose D using the well-known equation, D(Gy) = 1.6 × 109 ϕ(cm−2) × LET(keV/μm). (1) The LET of a particle is calculated using the Bethe’s equation, with corrections [27]. To mimic the contributions of energy deposition from electron tracks of neighboring volumes, periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) were used. Briefly, the electrons that leave the irradiated volume are put back on the opposite side, with the same energy and direction vector [28].2.5. Statistical Analysis For discrete outcomes, such as viability, germination or deformed cotyledon counts, Fisher’s exact test was used to compare radiation exposure methods (control, acute, or low-dose rate) or to compare doses within each radiation scenario. For comparisons with root length as an outcome, quantile regression was used to compare medians, taking into account the possibility of non-germination and the generally left-skewed distribution of root lengths even if germination had occurred. For defining median root length, non-germination was treated as a length of zero. In other words, a median length of x0 is taken to mean 50% of plants had root lengths > x0, while the other 50% either did not germinate or if they did, had lengths < x0.3. Results 3.1. Effect of Titanium Ion and Proton Exposure on Imbibed Arabidopsis Seeds Irradiation of imbibed Arabidopsis seeds was delivered acutely (within minutes), or over a longer duration at a low dose rate (LDR) of 0.166 cGy/min for 40 cGy 300 MeV/n titanium ions (Ti), or 40 cGy 250 MeV/n protons. Mathematical simulations showed that the fluence of these particles over an Arabidopsis embryo reached 1750 to 2000 hits/seed for titanium ions (approximately 0.5 hits/cell) and over 800,000 hits/seed for protons (approximately over 200 hits/cell). Examples of simulated Ti, proton, and simulated GCR1 and 2 particle tracks within the volume of one cell (12 μm × 12 μm × 12 μm) are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.

In addition, there were obvious increases in the percentage of cotyledon deformation in the irradiated groups (Figure 2A right panel, Figure 2D). Furthermore (Figure 2A, right panel), exposure to titanium ions had a noticeable effect on root development alone, with no measurable roots in 13 of 25 (52%) germinated seeds (LDR group) as compared with 8 of 25 (32%) seeds (acute group) and only 1 of 28 (3.6%) seeds (control group) (p < 0.001, Fisher exact test).

(D) Examples of cotyledon deformation. * Indicates p < 0.05 compared to controls.Overall, the distribution of root length in seedlings was shifted downwards (Figure 2C) relative to the control distribution in the two irradiated groups with median lengths of 22.2, 6.4, and 0 mm, for the control, acute, and LDR groups respectively. (The median length was zero for the LDR group because for more than half (14 of 27) of these seeds, germination did not occur or roots did not develop to the point where they were measurable). Even when comparing the upper parts of the root length distribution, we observed a similar pattern; for example, 75th-percentile root lengths were 24, 19, and 14 mm for control, acute, and LDR groups, respectively (Figure 2B). Similarly, when considering only plants with measurable root lengths, estimated median root length ± 1SE was 22.2 ± 2.8 mm for control seeds, decreasing to 17.3 ± 3.0 mm after acute exposure and to 9.5 ± 3.1 mm (LDR exposure). Exposure to protons had virtually no effect on the ability of seeds to germinate with more than 90% germination rates for all experimental conditions: control seeds (98%, 55/56), acute exposure (95%, 38/40), and LDR exposure (92.8%, 39/42) (Figure 3A). However estimated median root lengths differed markedly between the experimental groups: (F(2, 135) = 38.4; p < 0.0001). Estimates of median lengths and standard errors were: 24.1 ± 0.6 mm (control), 16.7 ± 0.7 mm (acute exposure), and 18.6 ± 0.6 mm (LDR exposure) (Figure 3B). Figure 3C shows the effects of irradiation on the distribution of root lengths in plants from germinated seeds. Furthermore, exposure to protons, as low as 20 cGy (data not shown), also resulted in significantly shorter and more under-developed roots without obvious deformation of leaf and root tissue. These results suggest that SPEs, which contain protons with a broad energy spectrum, may have a potential impact on plant growth after germination as was also seen for GCR exposures (next section).

Effect of GCR-1 Scenario on Imbibed Arabidopsis Seeds About 85% of imbibed Arabidopsis seeds germinated in all treatment groups, regardless of exposure to CGR1 radiation (Figure 4A). The relatively large number of non-germinated seeds (six in each group) resulted in a loss of power to discriminate between treatment groups with respect to median root length. Median root lengths were similar for control plants and for plants grown from seeds exposed to simulated acute or LDR GCR1 radiation at 29 cGy, but appeared reduced after exposure to 59 cGy GCR1 radiation (Figure 4B). Considering only the germinated seeds, the median root lengths of plants from seeds exposed to acute 59 cGy GCR1 radiation were noticeably shorter (median length = 15.7 mm as compared with controls, median length = 19.8 mm; p = 0.007). The distribution of the root length data from germinated seeds is displayed in Figure 4C. Figure 4.

Effect of GCR2 on Dry Arabidopsis and Mizuna Seeds Dry Arabidopsis and Mizuna seeds were exposed to GCR2 radiation, a simplified and standard six-beam simulation scenario recommended by the NSRL, rather than the GCR1 scenario, which generated a much more complex radiation field for post-irradiation analysis. For Arabidopsis seeds, the effect of GCR2 radiation was negligible in that 401 of the 406 seeds planted germinated with notable root development (Figure 5A). For LDR exposure, estimated median root lengths were virtually the same for all dose groups. For acute exposure, there was only a slight indication of a tendency for plants to have degraded root lengths (p = 0.04, p = 0.02 for doses of 40 and 80 cGy respectively; Figure 5B). In the case of Mizuna, although virtually all seeds (356 of 360) also germinated with root development (Figure 5C), we observed evidence of an acute irradiation effect on the incidence of plants with deformed leaves, with 7 of 59 (11.9%) control plants having deformed leaves (control), as compared with 23 of 59 (39.0%) and 14 of 59 (23.7%) for 40 cGy and 80 cGy exposures (p = 0.003, Fisher exact test) (Figure 5D). No such effect was seen after LDR exposure. Similarly, we observed a 17% reduction in median root length of Mizuna plants after acute irradiation compared to the control (95% conf (-27.6%, -7.4%), p = 0.001), whereas there was no noticeable effect of LDR irradiation on root length (Figure 5E).

Effect of SPE on Imbibed Arabidopsis and Mizuna For imbibed Arabidopsis seeds, there was no noticeable effect of simulated-SPE dose on percentages of germination) for either acute or LDR exposures (Figure 6A) or on median root length (p = 0.35 and p = 0.06, comparing all doses, Acute and LDR respectively) (Figure 6B). However, for imbibed Mizuna seeds exposed to acute simulated SPE radiation (Figure 6C), percentages of negative outcomes (non-germinated seeds or plants with deformed cotyledon structure) tended to increase with dose (Fisher’s exact test comparing all doses including control; p = 0.0011, Figure 6D). For LDR exposure, percentages of negative outcomes also tended to increase with dose, however the effect was not as striking (Figure 6C, Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.034). There was no noticeable effect of dose on median root length for either type of exposure (p = 0.40 and p = 0.97, comparing all doses, acute and LDR respectively) (Figure 6E). Figure 6.

Discussion For future missions back to the Moon or on to Mars, living organisms will be exposed constantly to GCR and occasionally to particles from large solar particle events (SPE), even with effective shielding from the structural materials of vehicles, surface bases, the Martian atmosphere, and the Moon and Mars themselves. Transit vehicles will include protected spaces for astronauts with significantly heavier shielding; however, there are currently no requirements being developed for shielding plant growth or seed storage areas, not only for transit vehicles, but also for Lunar or Martian surface bases. Our study focused on anticipated radiation exposure for long-duration deep space missions such as a 3-year Mars mission. Table 2 summarizes estimates of total GCR dose equivalent rates for different space environments [6,7,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36]. For comparison purposes and due to the availability of the data, we presented the dose equivalent rates in Table 2 even though these dose equivalent rates were estimated based on human biological effectiveness, which may not be applicable to plants. Table 2. GCR dose equivalent rate (mSv/day) at different locations.

We also chose a higher dose point of 80 cGy for all simulated GCR irradiation experiments to evaluate the dose response and possible maximum GCR impact on seeds. For some experiments, 20 cGy exposures were used as well. Compared to GCR, the occurrence time, duration, and fluence of an SPE are not predictable. Therefore, for the SPE simulation, we used the model developed by the NSRL based on combining characteristics of two large historical events, namely the fluence of the August 1972 event along with an energy spectrum similar to the March 1989 event [22,23]. We selected three dose points, 40, 80, and 200 cGy, based on the estimated skin doses with 5 g/cm2 to 20 g/cm2 shielding during the August 1972 SPE [37]. These dose points allow us to determine potential dose response and compare it with the GCR effects. Our study investigated two fundamental questions: (1) whether deep space GCR or SPE protons impacts plant seeds and their growth, and (2) which factors such as species, dose, dose rate, particle type, or some combination of these produce the most detrimental effects. Seeds received either acute exposure within 10–15 min (40–50 mGy/min), or relatively LDR exposures (1.66–3.33 mGy/min and 4.44 mGy/min for GCR and SPE, respectively). Due to facility constraints, the resulting LDR dose for simulated GCR is higher than the dose rate in deep space, but chronic exposure is more relevant in deep-space scenarios than is acute exposure. 4.1. Charged Particle Exposure and Hydrated Arabidopsis Seeds In the first part of this study, we chose hydrated Arabidopsis seeds to expose to various single particles (protons and titanium ions), as well as the more complex GCR1 scenario. The GCR1 scenario was developed by Dr. Hada’s group [21] using sequential primary beams and shielding materials to generate a complex mixed radiation field. This was the first time a simulated GCR scenario has been utilized for plant research. Hydrated seeds contain growing embryos that are presumably more sensitive to radiation damage than dry seeds and mature plants, therefore, we expected the radiation impact, if any, would be shown in these hydrated seeds. In our study, the seeds were hydrated 24 h before irradiation and maintained at 4 °C in the dark. This experimental condition was developed to maintain the seeds in a hydrated, but still relatively dormant stage, to avoid the influence of environmental fluctuations that might interfere with the seeds’ responses to radiation. In particular, temperature can affect both the germination process and DNA repair efficiency. Another factor is the light level that hydrated seeds are exposed to before, during, and after irradiation. Light regimes have been shown to dictate the specific activation and efficiency of some DNA repair pathways such as recombination or photo-repair in various plants [38,39,40]. In this study, we maintained all dry and hydrated samples in the dark to avoid the effects of different light regimes, which may generate significant variations among different samples and experiments. Exposure of hydrated seeds to these radiation scenarios had little impact on the rate of any signs of germination (including seed coat rupture), which is consistent with other studies. However, morphological changes, especially on root length measurements, of the seedlings cultured from irradiated seeds were found to be dose- and quality-dependent, suggesting that heavier ions cause more severe damage (Figure 7). Because of logistical constraints, we only evaluated seeds subjected to a 24-h imbibition interval. It is possible that at different growing stages with rapidly dividing and differentiating cells of different plant organs, seedlings may show different radiosensitivities [41,42]. The possibility of differential effects of irradiation depending on growth stage needs to be tested further. Figure 7. Open in a new tab A plot of estimated ratios (treatment to control) of median root length (proton and CGR) or 75th percentiles (Ti) along with 95% confidence intervals showing that the Arabidopsis seedlings from irradiated seeds generally have shortened root length. Larger uncertainties for Ti exposure reflect the smaller sample size as well as the failure of many seeds to germinate or produce measurable roots. * Indicates p < 0.05 compared to controls.4.2. Space Mission Relevant Experiments In actual deep space radiation scenarios, GCR presents a constant extremely low dose rate background radiation field. Because seed imbibition occurs over a relatively short interval (hours to days depending on seed types), maximum cumulative GCR dose during imbibition is expected to be at the milligray range for a 10-day exposure. Therefore, protons released from a large SPE, typically delivered within a couple of days, pose a more significant impact for imbibed seeds than GCR exposure. On the other hand, dry seeds in long-term storage during deep space missions would be exposed to a much higher accumulative GCR dose, which may affect seed viability over long-duration missions. Therefore, we evaluated GCR impact on dry seeds of Arabidopsis and Mizuna, and SPE effect on imbibed seeds. For dry Arabidopsis seeds, the GCR-2 scenario did not cause significant changes in germination, viability, or morphology. Root length was impacted more in imbibed seeds by exposure to GCR1 (59 cGy) than in dry seeds by exposure to GCR2 (80 cGy), indicating hydrated seeds are more sensitive to radiation damage as expected. Furthermore, radiation quality plays an important role because 250 MeV/n proton (40 cGy) showed more significant impact on hydrated Arabidopsis seeds than simulated SPE (40 cGy) with spectra ranging from 50 to 150 MeV/n, even though both radiation scenarios cause shortened root length. Interestingly, in Mizuna seeds, for the first time, we found a significantly increased abnormality rate in the seedlings developed from both GCR2 and SPE irradiated dry seeds. In contrast to Arabidopsis seeds, dry Mizuna seeds showed an increase in cotyledon deformation with increasing levels of acute GCR2 exposure. This difference between species highlights the need to identify and focus research on crops most likely to contribute to spaceflight missions, as outcomes from model organisms are not universal and may not be applicable. Increased cotyledon deformation was not significant following LDR, indicating potential activation of DNA repair mechanisms. Further evaluation of various crops may help to identify those most resistant to DNA damage and enable identification and screening for the most efficient repair mechanisms.4.3. Comparison with Other Studies Numerous studies have shown that the effects of ionizing radiation on plants are significantly influenced by species, cultivar, development stage, tissue architecture and genome organization, as well as radiation features, e.g., quality, dose, and duration of exposure [11]. However, very few of these studies used radiation fields that are comparable to deep space radiation in quality and quantity. Plant seeds have been flown on the ISS and beyond LEO spaceflight missions [12,13,14], which are mostly short-duration experiments. There have been several long-duration exposures of seeds to the space environment using different platforms such as the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) facility, the EXPOSE facility, and the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). MISSE and EXPOSE are multi-user facilities designed to operate outside of the ISS. The LDEF was deployed to low-Earth orbit (LEO) at approximately 250 nautical miles in 1984 and had orbited the Earth for about 5.7 years. It was retrieved in 1990 at about 178 nautical miles. At present, MISSE and EXPOSE are still operational. The reports of these studies are not quite consistent. In a 27-month EXPOSE-R experiment stationed outside the ISS, analysis of the germination results revealed that the tomato seeds did not survive the exposure to radiation with or without UV. Arabidopsis seeds survived only in a dark layer shielded from UV exposure and were able to germinate and further develop [43]. In another report from Tepfer et al. [44], the EXPOSE-R exposure (without UV) significantly reduced the germination rate of seeds from two wild type Arabidopsis lines: Columbia (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (Ws-2), with Ws-2 showing more sensitivity to space radiation exposure than Col-0. DNA degradation was found in the seeds exposed to UV, but not significantly in those shielded from UV exposure [44]. In contrast, under a different space environmental condition in the LDEF flight, tomato seeds maintained at a controlled climate of 14 psi with 15% humidity at an altitude between 175 to 275 nautical miles only showed that the pores of the strophiole region of the flight seeds were larger in size than those in the ground control seeds, which might affect germination [12]. For other space radiation related research platforms, in a very recent experiment using the Cosmic Ray Exposure Sequencing Science (CRESS) payload system, a 1U CubeSat design, Arabidopsis seeds (under 1 atm) were exposed to the stratosphere (36–40 km) environment above Antarctica in a 30-day, long-duration high altitude balloon mission [45]. In a parallel experiment, dry seeds were exposed to a 40 cGy GCR1 simulation at NSRL. GCR and stratosphere exposed seeds showed significantly reduced germination rates of 76.4% and 82.5%, respectively compared to 98% for the controls. Significantly elevated somatic mutation rates (and developmental aberrations) were also revealed in these GCR or stratosphere exposed seeds with the GCR exposure generating significantly higher mutation rates than that of Antarctica. These mutations also resulted in the death or delayed growth of certain plant organs. Heritable mutations were found in the second generation of the GCR irradiated seeds [45]. DNA damage, degradation, and mutation are the major findings of radiation impacts on seeds and plants in many studies [9,10,11,44,45]. Further investigations are needed to fully characterize DNA damage and DNA damage repair in response to space radiation, as well as the multigenerational effects. In addition to flight studies, numerous ground radiation studies have been conducted using ground-based radiation sources. Many of these studies did not target space exploration but aimed to evaluate impacts of radiation accidents on the environment, as well as using radiation as a tool to generate desired mutations to benefit agriculture. Among these studies, those conducted in highly contaminated radiation background areas at a dose rate relevant to deep space are particularly of interest. Many studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of chronic low-dose rate exposure on biological organisms including plants. Some have reported significant genotypic and phenotypic changes in plants within the exclusion zone with a relatively low dose-rate [46,47,48]. In general, our findings are in agreement with these studies, and by using ground based GCR and SPE simulations, we provided further evidence that space radiation exposures affect both dry and imbibed seeds.5. Conclusions and Future Work In our study, we have confirmed for the first-time ground-based simulation of GCR and SPE has an impact on Arabidopsis and Mizuna seeds. We observed dependence of outcome measures on dose, dose rate, and radiation quality, with heavier ions causing more severe damage. Exposures to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had much less effect compared to exposures to heavier and higher LET particles, but there were significant impacts that appear to be dependent on the seed type. As expected, hydrated seeds were more sensitive to radiation exposure than were dry seeds. Complementary to the results we presented here, it is very important to understand the cellular and molecular basis of these findings. Numerous parameters can be evaluated in future studies to provide deeper insights in the mechanisms behind these reported findings, from analyzing relative sizes and cellular organization of the apical meristem and elongation zone, to conducting multi-omics analyses. Plant DNA damage response and repair mechanisms in response to space radiation also need to be fully characterized. To this end, we are currently conducting an RNAseq analysis using the harvested seedling samples from this study. In addition, we are in the process of evaluating the degree to which GCR and SPE radiation exposures affect the ability of seeds of mizuna, lettuce, and tomato to develop into adult plants and edible fresh produce. In space, plant seeds are exposed to multiple space environmental factors, such as altered gravity, suboptimal growth conditions including water stress, high CO2 and environmental volatile organic compound (VOC) levels, ethylene generation, and altered air pressure that may cause stress and impact plant growth. Furthermore, plants developed from sanitized seeds may be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens from the unique microbiome of a transit vehicle. The space radiation environment may further impair the ability of seeds and plants to adapt to these environmental challenges during long-duration missions. In order to support successful integration of fresh food production systems in future spaceflight missions, more studies need to be conducted to understand radiation impacts on a wider variety of space crop candidates and other developmental stages in the plant life cycle, such as young seedling growth, embryogenesis, and seed maturation. More studies are also needed to identify physical or biological methods that efficiently protect or repair seeds from deep space radiation.Acknowledgments We appreciate all the support from the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Lab.Author Contributions Conceptualization, Y.Z.; methodology, Y.Z., J.T.R. and M.H.

Copyright notice ID: 10472590 PMID: 37662183 Plants were essential to the early evolution of terrestrial life and colonization of the young Earth (Kapoor et al., 2023). Plant communities continue to colonize and transform our planet including the newest ecosystems formed post-glaciation, restoring those degraded by human activities and adapting to changing ecological conditions (Huston and Smith, 1987; Chapin et al., 1994; Yuan et al., 2020; Heim et al., 2021). Plants cannot move away from a harmful stimulus, and thus, have evolved remarkable strategies to survive and eventually thrive in harsh environments. Today, humanity is on the verge of exploring our solar system and beyond, eager to discover, answer fundamental questions, and search for extraterrestrial forms of life. Undoubtedly, plants are key organisms to successful deep space missions and independence from the provision of terrestrial resources, whether for long duration interplanetary travel or establishing permanent settlements. We can employ terrestrial bio-design principles to mimic plant colonization on Earth and explore adaptations to novel ecosystems. This can be combined with precise molecular tools to enable long-term human space exploration. With this thought in mind, we have collated articles focusing on terrestrial plants from extreme environments and their adaptations to harsh conditions. This collective knowledge will advance the selection of desired plant characteristics relevant to human space missions and assist in the identification of valuable adaptive mechanisms that can be genetically engineered in targeted space food plants. Furthermore, terrestrial plants from the edge of habitability define limits for terrestrial forms of life and thus can direct efforts for the search for life beyond Earth (McKay, 2014; Huwe et al., 2019). In this Research Topic, De Micco et al. present an exhaustive review on the hazards of cosmic ionizing radiation to human exploration and discuss potential roles for plants in mitigating this Research Topic. The authors highlight difficulties in studying ionizing radiation in deep space that stem from deploying inadequate radiation sources, limited access to ion beam accelerators, and lack of uniformity in radiation doses and dose rates (acute, chronic) across studies. The authors expand on the remarkable resistance of plants growing in regions of high radioactivity and the possibility of using such plants in shielding or for pharmaceutical countermeasures. Next, Molina-Montenegro et al. demonstrate the benefits of co-culturing relevant crops with endophytic fungi in simulated deep space environments to augment plant performance in high UV radiation, low temperature, and low water availability. In this instance, plants from mesic habitats were combined with fungi from the extreme environment of the Atacama Desert, which as the driest place in the world and also experiences excessive solar irradiance. Increased survival in crops inoculated with desert fungi was related to higher biomass, antioxidant content and nutritional quality in deep space-like environmental conditions compared to non-inoculated plants. Thus, Molina- Montenegro et al. contribute to developing the use of symbionts from extreme terrestrial environments to improve the efficiency of crop cultivation in space. In another study, Gong et al. challenged emerging seedlings with growth mediums of varying particle size, porosity, and compactness, which is pivotal to understanding the intricacies of germinating seeds in extraterrestrial regolith in future space farms. Extraterrestrial regolith on anhydrous and airless celestial bodies is formed by vastly different processes than terrestrial soils. These processes include large and small meteoroid impacts, star plasma winds, and cosmic ionizing radiation, and cause distinct mechanical, physical, and hydraulic properties. Gravitational effects further impact regolith formation by affecting collision and aggregation velocities, which influences the values of bulk densities and the porosity of the outermost regolith layers. Using CT scans corroborated by mathematical models, Gong et al. demonstrate that underground seedlings search for a path of least resistance irrespective of the distance to the surface, and that high porosity and low compactness of the growth medium are conducive to seedling emergence. This finding informs plant cultivation on the Moon using in situ regolith. Due to micrometeoroid impacts, lunar regolith has very fine, low- density particles with complex shapes, sharp jagged edges, and a high angular surface. According to Gong et al., these tight and abrasive pore spaces could impede seedling path to the surface. However, the lower gravitational field on the Moon results in much lower regolith bulk densities, hence low compactness, which, according to the findings of Gong et al., is likely to promote seedling emergence. Another study in this Research Topic addressed the quest for extraterrestrial life. Battistuzzi et al. explore if the light spectrum emissions from faint and cool stars is sufficient for oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. This is relevant to the search for oxygen biosignatures on exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf or Red Dwarf stars in habitable zones. These stars emit light at the far-red (700–750nm) and infrared (750–1000nm) wavelengths, unlike the Sun, which emits light predominantly in the visible and UV spectrum. On Earth, photosynthesizing plants harvest solar blue and red light for the light reactions of photosynthesis, so the capacity for low energy photons at longer wavelengths to photolyze H2O was unknown. Battistuzzi et al. show that cyanobacteria can acclimate to the simulated M-dwarf light spectrum by elevating the concentration of pigments capable of quenching low-energy photons and by increasing the efficiency of utilizing the sparse high-energy photons. There was no difference in biomass production nor O2 release between cyanobacteria grown under either light spectrum. This demonstrates that the photosynthetic apparatus, which evolved in the earliest terrestrial life forms, could perform in the presence of cool and dim starlight. As such, Battistuzzi et al. contribute a rare physiological analysis to theoretical models evaluating the feasibility of M-dwarf stars to support photosynthesis. This informs and legitimizes the search for oxygen biosignatures. This Research Topic was conceived with the intent to present research, methods, and reviews to further our understanding of plant survival in harsh or novel environments, and that can be extrapolated to the conditions found in deep space. As humanity leaves Earth’s protective influence to explore the solar system and beyond, we require the knowledge and ideas developed by plant scientists, such as those assembled in this Research Topic, to take plants with us and deploy them to perform mission-critical functions. Once at the destination, guided by the knowledge of plant evolutionary solutions, we will know where to look for extraterrestrial life. Author contributions AZ: Writing – original draft.

    "introduction": "Introduction Historical background of the gowanus canal The Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, NY, USA is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund site (Miller 2015) which contains significant amounts of chemicals of concern (Mandigo et al. 2016). These include heavy metals like arsenic, copper, lead, and iron; halogenated compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB); chlorinated solvents and fungicides, including carbon tetrachloride and ethylene dibromide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); volatile organic compounds (VOC) and semivolatile organic compounds; petroleum products; and dissolved salts, including brine and other acids such as tartaric acid (U.S. EPA 2011). Following the 2010 designation of the canal as a Superfund site on the National Priorities List, plans were announced to dredge and sub-aquatically cap the waterway over a decade (U.S. EPA 2012) in a multiphase project expected to finish in mid-2025 (Krisel 2015). Microbial response to anthropogenic contamination The Gowanus Canal is an extreme environment with both built and natural components in the most populated city in the U.S. (U.S. Census Bureau 2025), and provides a testbed for studying the impact of engineered environments on resident ecosystems. Studies have shown that microorganisms, especially extremophiles, respond to the challenge of anthropogenic contaminants through adaptive degradation and biosorption (Xu et al. 2010, Ghosh and Das 2018, McCutcheon et al. 2021, Sharma et al. 2021). One such example includes the rapid shifts in marine microbial population observed after the DeepWater Horizon Spill both in open ocean (Mason et al. 2012, Redmond and Valentine 2012, Kimes et al. 2014) and coastal wetlands (King et al. 2015), where the relative abundance of petrochemical-degrading species increased significantly after the spill. In addition to natural adaptation of endogenous species, microbial remediation can occur by introducing target species to an environment. For example, introduction of a consortium consisting of probiotic bacteria efficient in degrading naturally occurring petroleum hydrocarbons to coral environments was shown to be effective in remediating oil spills without negatively impacting the coral holobiont, unlike using chemical dispersants (Fragoso ados Santos et al. 2015). A two-stage fungal remediation study to tackle textile industry dye effluent utilizing both adsorption and accumulation illustrated the potential of integrated approaches in bioremediation (Mathur et al. 2018). Microbial bioremediation, while presenting constraints of efficacy and scale, can be considered preferable over physico-chemical remediation as it does not leave further residues (Das and Dash 2014). Superfund sites, with their high concentrations of toxic compounds, can be considered an extreme environment and extremophiles are known for their potential for bioremediation (Kaushik et al. 2021). While every Superfund site is unique in its composition of contaminants, a growing body of literature has shown that microbial bioremediation often develops spontaneously. While microbial diversity can be decreased at a toxic site, the abundance of bioremediation-related species increases (Lowe et al. 2002) with specific functions such as the microbial dechlorination of compounds, including PCBs (Rodenburg et al. 2015). Microbial bioremediation is a long standing practice (Antizar-Ladislao 2010), and more recently sequencing technologies and metagenomic analyses have enabled the identification of genes and species responsible for observed remediation-related metabolisms (Dangi et al. 2019, Gupta et al. 2020). These observations, in addition to the accelerated evolution of microbial communities in extreme environments (Li et al. 2014), make Superfund sites candidates for metabolism mining—both with respect to contaminant-related functions, such as metal rare earth element binding, and also for discovery of novel functions or metabolites of potential biotechnological interest. Indeed, microorganisms in the environment can produce a wealth of secondary metabolites (SMs) which have been historically used for various biotechnological applications, including production of antibiotics, anticancer agents, and agrochemicals (Katz and Baltz 2016). SMs synthesized through the expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) can be hard to identify using bioactivity screens as BGCs are often silent, only activated under pleiotropic environmental triggers such as growth condition variation or introduction of competing species (Rutledge and Challis 2015). Genome mining using high-throughput sequencing approaches has been used to identify BGCs responsible for encoding these SMs without the need for identifying the appropriate activation triggers (Udwary et al. 2021). In particular, environmental microbiomes, even urban ones, can be a rich substrate for the discovery of such molecules (Charlop-Powers et al. 2016). Given the Gowanus Canal’s unique—and extreme—environment, we hypothesize that its microbiome might be a source of novel BGCs. To provide a detailed molecular portrait of the microbial adaptations in the Canal, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and a suite of bioinformatic tools with the goals to (i) characterize species diversity, (ii) assess potential for bioremediation, and (iii) discover novel BGCs. As a community that has thrived in a highly contaminated environment for over a century and a half, this microbiome may hold keys for living and thriving under uniquely toxic selection pressures as particular to the putative Anthropocene era (Waters and Turner 2022).",

    "results": "Results Microbial community characteristics as related to environmental context Microbial community metrics Species abundance was computed for all the samples. Kendall correlation (Fig. S1) shows groupings of Gowanus samples into two broad sets, the Core Samples and the Sediment Samples. UMAP dimensional reduction (Fig. 2a) reflects a differential distribution of species based on both location and data type, and groups the samples as Core, Sediment_Winter14 and Sediment_Spring_15, with an overlap between the two Sediment samples. In order to investigate sequencing depth as a factor in this grouping (Core samples were sequenced at higher depth that the Sediment samples, see Table S1 for read depths), we downsampled the Core reads to the average Sediment read depth to generate a normalized dataset. This normalized dataset also generates a similar UMAP plot as seen in Fig. S2, and the full dataset was used for all subsequent analyses. Of a total of 455 species identified across all samples (Table S2), we identified including 13 archaeal species, 241 species of bacteria, and 201 viruses/phages. Of these, 85 species are shared across all the 3 sample sets, and the 2 sediment sample sets share 128 species (Fig. 2d). Figure 2. Open in a new tab (a) UMAP dimension reduction visualization of taxonomic profiles based on MetaPhlAn3 species abundance profiles. Color legend is shared with Fig. 2b. Axes are arbitrary and without meaningful scale. (b) NMDS visualization of Beta Diversity using the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity metric separating sample sets. Ellipses represent 99.99% confidence intervals. (c) Alpha Diversity according to Shannon and Simpson indices. Each plot includes a scatter plot, a box plot, and a half violin plot. (d) Venn Diagram of species identified across different sample sets.We next evaluated intra-sample alpha and beta taxonomic diversity of our collections. We found that samples from the Core set were different from Sediment samples with lower alpha-diversity (Fig. 2c). While the Shannon index accounts for species richness by including rare species, the Simpson index gives more weight to evenness and common species. Both metrics are independent of group size, therefore the uneven distribution of sample numbers in Core and Sediment sets does not affect the alpha diversity metric (Roswell et al. 2021). Shannon [Kruskal–Wallis, chi-squared = 16.202, P-value = 0.0003033] and Simpson indices [Kruskal–Wallis, chi-squared = 16.022, P-value = 0.0003318] attain statistical significance. Beta-diversity was calculated by Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index and scaled using NDMS (Fig. 2b). The NDMS plot of the taxonomic profiles showed slight separation between the two groups of Sediment sample sets; however, these differences were minor. The samples in the Core set are different from the samples in the Sediment set according to this metric, also previously observed in the UMAP plot (Fig. 2a).Species characterization according to environmental and historical context Marine organisms related to geographic environment Originally in a productive tidal estuary stewarded by the Lenni Lenape people for over 9000 years before colonial contact (Doyle 1996), the present-day environment of the canal is a combination of original sediment, over 150 years of industrial waste, inputs from surrounding runoff and combined sewage overflows (CSOs), and tidal influx. Accordingly, many species found in the Gowanus Canal were previously identified in either marine or freshwater sediment, water or soil. (See Methods for microbial characterization strategies.) Marine sediment species identified include Modestobacter marinus [also radiation-tolerant (Normand et al. 2012)], Labilibaculum filiforme, Draconibacterium orientale (Du et al. 2014), Maribacter arcticus, Sedimentitalea nanhaiensis, Halioglobus lutimaris, Shimia aestuarii, and Thiobacillus denitrificans; and Planktomarina temperata from sea water. Fewer freshwater sediment species were identified, including Methanobacterium lacus and Xanthobacter autotrophicus. Known soil microbes identified include Micrococcus aloeverae and Mycolicibacterium chubuense.Extremophiles related to contamination Given their high concentrations of contaminants, Superfund sites are considered to be extreme environments (Tighe et al. 2017). We identified a number of extremophiles in the Canal, including psychrophilic, thermophilic, and halophilic organisms. Psychrophiles (cryophiles) are organisms capable of surviving in low temperatures especially in deep sea beds and sediments. We identified psychrophiles such as Cryobacterium arcticum (Bajerski et al. 2011), Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus, Hyphomonas jannaschiana (also a barophile), Labilibaculum filiforme, Ma. arcticus, and Thiobacillus denitrificans. The EPA and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation has classified Gowanus as Class SD type saline environment (GEI Consultants 2009). Consistent with this, we observed halophiles, defined as organisms tolerant to hyper saline environments, including Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, Mi. aloeverae (also an alkaliphile), Se. nanhaiensis, and Vibrio diazotrophicus. We also observed a few thermophiles which are organisms adapted for survival in higher temperatures such as Lachnospira pectinoschiza and Thermoleophilum album. On a species level, some of the extremotolerant organisms identified are known for their bioremediation properties. Microbacterium laevaniformans, which has been identified across multiple samples, has previously been isolated from areas contaminated with heavy metals (Brown et al. 2012).Microbial species related to the human gut Consistent with the frequent CSO from the 11 sewage outfalls (see report “Gowanus Canal—DEP” by U.S. EPA 2025) that can release untreated waste into the Canal, we have identified species usually associated with the human gut. In the following list of species, those known for their potential for developing resistance to clinically used antimicrobial drugs are starred (*). These include Gram-negative bacteria like Acinetobacter johnsonii, Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Gemmiger formicilis, and Tyzzerella nexilis and Gram-positive human gastrointestinal bacteria, including Clostridium leptum, Anaerostipes hadrus, Blautia obeum, Holdemanella biformis, Bulleidia extructa*, Collinsella aerofaciens*, Collinsella intestinalis*, ​​Enorma massiliensis*, Gardnerella vaginalis*, Mycobacterium gordonae*, Lach. pectinoschiza*, and Streptococcus salivarius*. Lactobacillus animalis* also isolated from the Canal, is a commonly consumed probiotic. Archaeal commensal species known to be components of the gut microbiome were identified, including Methanobrevibacter smithii* and Methanobacterium formicicum. See Table S3 for annotation of microbial characteristics generated through the Microbe Directory (Sierra et al. 2019).Gowanus canal as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance Investigating further the potential for the Gowanus Canal to be a reservoir of AMR, we characterized the known classes and mechanisms using the database MEGARes (Table S4 for list of genes associated with AMR, Table S5 for their mechanisms and Table S6 for their classification). We identified 28 genes within 8 classes of antibiotic resistance, the major ones being Rifamycin (which includes Rifampin) and Aminoglycosides, and others, including Tetracyclines, Elfamycins, Phenicol, Sulfonamides, Multi-Drug Resistance, and MLS as shown in Figure S3a. Of these, the most frequently identified gene (ARO:3 003 465, confiring rifampicin resistance) has been identified in 15 out of the 37 samples. The common drug-class mechanisms through which the above noted genes confer resistance is shown in Figure S3b. The above analysis attributes genus-level classification when possible to the identified genes, and in this analysis, two of the AMR genes were attributed to Mycobacterium (one Aminoglycoside and one Rifampin, Table S4). While we might assume that these AMR all come from human gut species as those flagged above, some environmental species identified in this dataset are known to harbor resistance genes as well. These include species previously isolated from water and sediment such as the sulfate-reducing Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus and Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, as well as Thermoleophilum album, Se. nanhaiensis, My. gilvum, and My. fallax. Other species potentially harboring AMR have been previously isolated from soil (My. chubuense and My. obuense), and plants (Mi. aloeverae) (Prakash et al. 2014). Characterization of bioremediation metabolisms Bioremediation pathways overview To further understand the relationship between the Canal microbiome and its environment, we classified metabolic pathways as defined by the MetaCYC (Caspi et al. 2020) database using the software HumanN3 (Beghini et al. 2021), (Table S7 for pathway list). Among them, we identified 64 pathways related to the Canal’s history of contamination, using the list of biotransformation pathways compiled by EAWAG (Gao et al. 2010) as keywords. Among these, 61 pathways fall within the MetaCyc superclass of Degradation/Utilization/Assimilation (DUA), two pathways belonging to the Biosynthesis superclass and one in Detoxification (Table S8). Within the DUA superclass, Aromatic Degradation is the most represented with 52 pathways, including compounds of historical relevance such as toluene, cresols, catechol and phenolic compounds (Fig. 3a). Figure 3. Open in a new tab (a) Relative abundance of metabolic pathways identified across all samples related to aromatic compound degradation (within the sub-class of DUA). (b) Correlation plot depicting the subset of pathways within the class of Aromatic Compound Degradation that were attributed to specific species.Bioremediation pathways of historical relevance and potential biotech applications Aromatic compound degradation Within the Aromatic Degradation class, toluene degradation is the most prevalent subclass (28%), followed by catechol (23%) and phenolic compound degradation (12%) (Fig. 3a). Seven of the bioremediation pathways were attributed to specific microbial species (7 species) (Fig. 3b). In two cases, we observe a one-to-many relationship: a given pathway is attributed to multiple species (e.g. “4-methylcatechol degradation” is associated to My. chlorophenicum and Mycobacterium sp Root135) and in one case, a many-to-one, i.e. a given species is associated with multiple pathways (e.g. Cycloclasticus zancles is associated to “catechol degradation to 2-oxopent-4-enoate II”, “catechol degradation I”, and “catechol degradation II”). In three cases, we observe a one-to-one relationship. Most of the pathways identified here are related to compounds identified by the EPA Superfund study (see report “Gowanus Canal Site Profile” by U.S. EPA 2025); however, some metabolisms relate to compounds that are not reported in this assessment, such as the PAHs mandelate and gallate. Besides aromatic compound degradation, the DUA pathways identified also fall in the C1 compound (Lee et al. 2019) utilization and alcohol degradation classes. Relevant to historical contaminants, these include formaldehyde assimilation, also not listed in the EPA site profile report.Heavy metal superstar In addition to organic contaminants, we assessed the metabolic potential of the Gowanus Canal microbiome for response to inorganic contaminants, specifically heavy metals. Of the 2 808 569 total genes identified by HumanN3 (available at https://github.com/HenaffLab/2023_Gowanus_Publication), 3153 encode proteins that are associated with heavy metals, with the largest number of genes associated with Iron (1743 genes) followed by Cobalt (446), Copper (441), and Nickel (286). Cadmium, Chromate, Lead, Mercury, Vanadium, Arsenic, and Aluminum all counted <100 genes for a given metal. Mechanisms include resistance (141 genes), oxidation/reduction (299), chelation (88), efflux (43), transport (939), and binding (752) (Table S10). Of the 3153 total metal-associated genes, 1172 are associated with one or more of 201 unique bacterial species (Table S12). Some of these species are associated with a large number of these genes, covering multiple metals (top species are Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, Methanobacterium lacus, Desulfococcus oleovorans, Ruminococcus torques, Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus, Methanosarcina_sp_MTP4, each encoding more than 20 metal related genes). BGC discovery Our approach to BGC discovery differs from the sequence similarity based functional analyses described above, since our method (1) identifies gene cluster structures in genomic data, as well as the sequence characteristics, and (2) utilizes assembled scaffolded contigs, rather than using single reads. SM compounds were divided into six classes depending on their biosynthetic origin: polyketides (PKs), non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs), Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), terpenoids, saccharides, and indole alkaloids (Keller et al. 2005, Medema et al. 2015). Overall, we identified 2319 assembled BGCs in our 37 total samples, including both sediment and core samples [using AntiSMASH5 (Blin et al. 2019) on assembled contigs, see Methods for more details]. Of the 2319 assembled BGCs, 1600 (69%) were classified into 5 predominant classes [using Big-SCAPE (Navarro-Muñoz et al. 2020), which represents a broad range of structural classes], with the remaining 719 unclassified (31%). The SM classes identified include Polyketides (PKS1 and PKSOthers, 18%), Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified Peptides (RiPPs, 21%), followed by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS, 15%), Terpenes (14%), and PKS-NRP Hybrids (<1%). BGCs can be grouped into gene cluster families (GCFs, or “families” hereon) that are functionally closely related and encode the production of the same or very similar molecules, which Big-SCAPE characterizes according to structural and sequence characteristics. Of the 2319 BGCs identified in our samples, 44% (1005) exhibited homology with at least one other BGC, grouping into 309 families, while 56% (1314) were singletons (considered as 1314 families of one). These total to 1623 families defining the 2319 total gene clusters identified (Fig. 4a). The largest family counts 28 BGCs, found in the group PKSOthers, followed by 12 in the RiPPs group. The average number of BGCs per family is 1 or 2 in every group. Figure 4. Open in a new tab (a) Stacked bar plot representing the number of BGC families by BGC class, differentiating singleton and non-singleton families. (b) Subset of gene cluster families characterized according to the MIBiG reference. Circle size depicts the number of BGCs belonging to the family, the color represents the type of BGC, position along the X axis depicts functional genes identified.While many families of BGCs have been computationally defined, few have been associated with specific SM compounds experimentally. The Minimum Information about a BGC (MIBiG 2.0) database (Kautsar et al. 2020) records such BGCs with known outputs, and among the 1623 families in our dataset, 13 of these display high similarity (>80%) with BGCs in MiBIG (calculated as the % of genes in the query cluster that have significant BLAST hits with a gene in the target cluster) (Fig. 4b). The remaining 1610 are not associated with a specific compound, and could potentially encode unknown (novel) compounds.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Here, we present the first in-depth metagenomic study of the Gowanus Canal, a Superfund site embedded in a residential/light manufacturing neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, USA. Taxonomic classification shows that this contaminated environment hosts a rich and diverse microbial population. The composition of this community includes species previously identified in marine sediment, as well as the human gut, reflecting both the estuarine environment and the presence of CSO outfalls. Collectively, the microbiome of the canal encodes a wide range of antimicrobial resistance genes, including some related to human pharmaceutical use. While some AMR alleles come from human gut species, some environmental species identified in this dataset are also known to harbor resistance genes. These include species previously isolated from water and sediment such as the sulfate-reducing Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus and Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, as well as Thermoleophilum album, Se. nanhaiensis, My. gilvum, and My. fallax. Other species potentially harboring AMR have been previously isolated from soil (My. chubuense and My. obuense), and plants (Mi. aloeverae). Of note, the material sampled in this study was sediment and this substrate contained both human gut related microbes as well as human related AMRs. This means that to a certain extent, human gut microbes from untreated waste streams are persisting in the sediment. Further research could address the fate of waste stream related microbes in the environment, their interactions with chemical contaminants, and the potential of CSOs to develop environmental AMR reservoirs. Recently literature has accumulated that points to contaminants’ effect on ARG persistence in the environment (Fletcher 2015), including historical industrial contaminants as well as emerging organic contaminants (Alderton et al. 2021). One such mechanism for this impact is that the prevalence of ARGs carried by live bacteria is impacted by the selection pressures their hosts are subject to (Mathur et al. 2018). Microbes evolve faster under stress (Li et al. 2014), and the Canal microbiome has been challenged with industrial contaminants since before the canal was dredged in 1853. We assessed the potential for this microbiome to be a reservoir of remediation-related functions through functional analysis, identifying gene coding potential and metabolic pathways encoded in this dataset. We identified bioremediation pathways related to degradation of VOCs and complex hydrocarbons, consistent with the historical industries of coal extraction and paint making at the site (Miller 2015). Interestingly, our data suggests that a given microbial species usually uses multiple mechanisms for degradation of a particular aromatic compound, and targets just one group of hydrocarbons. For example, Pseudomonas fluorescens encodes degradation of catechol through three pathways, including meta-cleavage and through the intermediate 2-oxoent-4-enoate. We also identified gene interactions related to heavy metals. In the case of metal related functions, a given species may encode molecular functionality related to multiple metals. Top species are Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, Methanobacterium lacus, Desulfococcus oleovorans, Ruminococcus torques, Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus, Methanosarcina_sp_MTP4, each encoding more than 20 metal related genes. While heavy metals are essential cofactors in many cellular processes, high heavy metal concentrations are also a stressor and microbes adapt by developing resistance mechanisms, including chelation and efflux (Anastassopoulou and Theophanides 1995, Lemire et al. 2013, Oves and Khan 2016, Panda et al. 2021). As such, these resistance mechanisms can be applied to biotech applications such as remediation through biosorption and bioaccumulation (Chojnacka 2010). Additionally, there is an interesting potential for using microbial mechanisms to recover rare earth metals from contaminated environments, as these metals are both contaminant and valuable resource (Jyothi et al. 2020). These studies encourage further research to gain insight on the biochemical potential of Superfund sites from the perspective of remediation and resource recovery. The current gold standard for characterization of new SMs is through metabolomic discovery. However, recent efforts to identify useful SMs leverage computational methods to mine metagenomic datasets for BGCs. These efforts are concentrating on soils as environments with potential for pharmacologically relevant molecules (Charlop-Powers et al. 2016, Negri et al. 2022, Waschulin et al. 2022) and on human body environments with potential to relate to disease phenotypes (Donia et al. 2014, Aleti et al. 2019). Here, we show that the Gowanus Canal depicts its own microenvironment encoding novel BGCs. This distribution of BGC families mirrors that reported by Nayfach et al. (2021) for the “bioremediation” category, as compared with other sources including aquatic, wastewater or terrestrial environments. The BGC family distribution observed in the Gowanus, however, differs from that reported in another Superfund site in Vermont, the Ely Copper Mines (Giddings et al. 2020). Indeed, the top two classes of the BGCs in Ely Copper Mines included NRPS and Terpenes. Of note, water and sediment can often have separate BGC profiles such as those described by Nayfach et al., and those from Lake Hillier, a hypersaline environment with distinctive pink color (Sierra et al. 2022). This signifies that irrespective of similarities between multiple extreme environments, the BGC characterization of each environment is unique. The results detailed in this manuscript point to the microbiome of the Gowanus Canal, an urban EPA Superfund site, as a reservoir for microbial mechanisms potentially important for biotechnological applications. Indeed, these microbes harbor bioremediation functions, degrading complex hydrocarbons as well as fixing heavy metals while also surviving in extreme conditions as a complex community. These functions can be seen as a resource, and further studied for potential biotechnological and engineering applications. One can imagine at least two avenues for augmenting the bioremediation potential of this resident microbiome. On one hand, one can isolate and characterize specific strains with functions of interest and culture them in bioreactors (Navina et al. 2024), perhaps engineering them to overexpress these genes for accelerated degradation (Dangi et al. 2019). This can be implemented in treating isolated waste, but poses challenges when scaling up and/or releasing genetically engineered strains into the environment (Navina et al. 2024). On the other hand, one can consider altering the environment in which these consortia have evolved, to help overcome limiting steps or apply principles of directed evolution. This has been successfully implemented in the context of microbial treatment of wastewater (Saravanan et al. 2023a), and biochar has been shown to effectively augment bioremediation performance due to its properties in altering microbial habitats on a micro scale (Saravanan et al. 2023b). Moving forward with either of these options requires considering the ethics of interventions on non-human organisms, because even though we can’t relate to microbes in the way we can to beasts of burden, “harnessing” them still implies making resources through labor (Krzywoszynska 2020). This work shows the co-occurence of ARGs and bioremediation metabolisms, and exciting future perspectives emerge from this research. In particular, an open question posed by this work and to be addressed in future studies is: what is the impact of industrial contaminants on the persistence of antimicrobial resistance genes in environmental reservoirs? These results outline the potential of this Superfund site and other contaminated sites across the world to be case studies to uncover the mechanics of interactions between antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination, and microbial community dynamics. We anticipate to follow up with this work with long-read sequencing approaches, contaminant quantifications, and co-culture experiments that would be able to reveal interactions within the consortia and their impact on metabolisms and ARG persistence.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion Once an ecologically diverse estuary and home to the Lenni-Lenape people, the Gowanus Creek was dredged in 1853 as part of ongoing colonial and industrial disruption to the land to become the Gowanus Canal. Its environment today is emblematic of the many post-industrial Superfund sites across the country. Like Gowanus, many of these locations were important sites for production and manufacturing industries that have now moved elsewhere leaving a material, economic, and social legacy of toxicity not only in the canal itself but also the surrounding areas As a result of the EPA’s remediation proposals (U.S. EPA 2012), the communities surrounding the Gowanus Canal (notably, those historically disproportionately affected by the contaminated environment) are now vulnerable to residential displacement, and deepening economic inequality (Krisel 2015) in addition to ongoing possible toxic exposure. The Gowanus Canal is considered a forsaken environment from our human perspective: the Superfund cleanup plan is to dredge the canal and cap it with an impermeable layer. Yet, this study shows that this environment is thriving from a microbial perspective. These microbes have evolved to survive harsh conditions, and have shown capability of not only remediate contaminants in the environment, but also produce novel SMs. These data show there is still much we can learn from these lifeforms who have evolved to inhabit industrial ruins. At a time where human disturbance has become a geological force, these results further suggest that we should redefine our relationship to the lifeforms we live amongst, with a responsibility for stewardship and reciprocity. These microscopic neighbors not only serve as a genetic catalog of bioremediation functions, but open our imagination to new modes of what theorist Anna Tsing calls “collaborative survival”—of ways to live together on a damaged planet (Tsing 2015).",

Copyright notice ID: 11999716 PMID: 40233938 Abstract Aims We investigate the bioremediation potential of the microbiome of the Gowanus Canal, a contaminated waterway in Brooklyn, NY, USA, designated a Superfund site by the US Environmental Protection Agency due to high concentrations of contaminants, including polychlorinated biphenyls, petrochemicals, and heavy metals.Methods and results We present a metagenomic analysis of the Gowanus Canal sediment, consisting of a longitudinal study of surface sediment and a depth-based study of sediment core samples. We demonstrate that the resident microbiome includes 455 species, including extremophiles across a range of saltwater and freshwater species, which collectively encode 64 metabolic pathways related to organic contaminant degradation and 1171 genes related to heavy metal utilization and detoxification. Furthermore, our genetic screening reveals an environmental reservoir of antimicrobial resistance markers falling within 8 different classes of resistance, as well as de-novo characterization of 2319 biosynthetic gene clusters and diverse groups of secondary metabolites with biomining potential.Conclusion The microbiome of the Gowanus Canal is a biotechnological resource of novel metabolic functions that could aid in efforts for bioremediation, AMR reservoir mapping, and heavy metal mitigation.Keywords: EPA Superfund, environmental contamination, metagenomics, bioremediation, antimicrobial resistance, biomining Impact Statement. The Gowanus Canal Superfund site is emblematic of the many post-industrial sites facing a legacy of hazardous pollutants, and its resident microbiome harbors the potential to remediate anthropogenic contaminants.Introduction Historical background of the gowanus canal The Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, NY, USA is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund site (Miller 2015) which contains significant amounts of chemicals of concern (Mandigo et al. 2016). These include heavy metals like arsenic, copper, lead, and iron; halogenated compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB); chlorinated solvents and fungicides, including carbon tetrachloride and ethylene dibromide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); volatile organic compounds (VOC) and semivolatile organic compounds; petroleum products; and dissolved salts, including brine and other acids such as tartaric acid (U.S. EPA 2011). Following the 2010 designation of the canal as a Superfund site on the National Priorities List, plans were announced to dredge and sub-aquatically cap the waterway over a decade (U.S. EPA 2012) in a multiphase project expected to finish in mid-2025 (Krisel 2015).Microbial response to anthropogenic contamination The Gowanus Canal is an extreme environment with both built and natural components in the most populated city in the U.S. (U.S. Census Bureau 2025), and provides a testbed for studying the impact of engineered environments on resident ecosystems. Studies have shown that microorganisms, especially extremophiles, respond to the challenge of anthropogenic contaminants through adaptive degradation and biosorption (Xu et al. 2010, Ghosh and Das 2018, McCutcheon et al. 2021, Sharma et al. 2021). One such example includes the rapid shifts in marine microbial population observed after the DeepWater Horizon Spill both in open ocean (Mason et al. 2012, Redmond and Valentine 2012, Kimes et al. 2014) and coastal wetlands (King et al. 2015), where the relative abundance of petrochemical-degrading species increased significantly after the spill. In addition to natural adaptation of endogenous species, microbial remediation can occur by introducing target species to an environment. For example, introduction of a consortium consisting of probiotic bacteria efficient in degrading naturally occurring petroleum hydrocarbons to coral environments was shown to be effective in remediating oil spills without negatively impacting the coral holobiont, unlike using chemical dispersants (Fragoso ados Santos et al. 2015). A two-stage fungal remediation study to tackle textile industry dye effluent utilizing both adsorption and accumulation illustrated the potential of integrated approaches in bioremediation (Mathur et al. 2018). Microbial bioremediation, while presenting constraints of efficacy and scale, can be considered preferable over physico-chemical remediation as it does not leave further residues (Das and Dash 2014). Superfund sites, with their high concentrations of toxic compounds, can be considered an extreme environment and extremophiles are known for their potential for bioremediation (Kaushik et al. 2021). While every Superfund site is unique in its composition of contaminants, a growing body of literature has shown that microbial bioremediation often develops spontaneously. While microbial diversity can be decreased at a toxic site, the abundance of bioremediation-related species increases (Lowe et al. 2002) with specific functions such as the microbial dechlorination of compounds, including PCBs (Rodenburg et al. 2015). Microbial bioremediation is a long standing practice (Antizar-Ladislao 2010), and more recently sequencing technologies and metagenomic analyses have enabled the identification of genes and species responsible for observed remediation-related metabolisms (Dangi et al. 2019, Gupta et al. 2020). These observations, in addition to the accelerated evolution of microbial communities in extreme environments (Li et al. 2014), make Superfund sites candidates for metabolism mining—both with respect to contaminant-related functions, such as metal rare earth element binding, and also for discovery of novel functions or metabolites of potential biotechnological interest. Indeed, microorganisms in the environment can produce a wealth of secondary metabolites (SMs) which have been historically used for various biotechnological applications, including production of antibiotics, anticancer agents, and agrochemicals (Katz and Baltz 2016). SMs synthesized through the expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) can be hard to identify using bioactivity screens as BGCs are often silent, only activated under pleiotropic environmental triggers such as growth condition variation or introduction of competing species (Rutledge and Challis 2015). Genome mining using high-throughput sequencing approaches has been used to identify BGCs responsible for encoding these SMs without the need for identifying the appropriate activation triggers (Udwary et al. 2021). In particular, environmental microbiomes, even urban ones, can be a rich substrate for the discovery of such molecules (Charlop-Powers et al. 2016). Given the Gowanus Canal’s unique—and extreme—environment, we hypothesize that its microbiome might be a source of novel BGCs. To provide a detailed molecular portrait of the microbial adaptations in the Canal, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and a suite of bioinformatic tools with the goals to (i) characterize species diversity, (ii) assess potential for bioremediation, and (iii) discover novel BGCs. As a community that has thrived in a highly contaminated environment for over a century and a half, this microbiome may hold keys for living and thriving under uniquely toxic selection pressures as particular to the putative Anthropocene era (Waters and Turner 2022).Materials and methods Site selection and sample collection Sediment sampling was performed across fourteen sites along the length (2.9 km) of the Canal (numbered 01–14 in Fig. 1). Sediment was sampled from a canoe, using a 4.5 m long PVC (PolyVinyl Chloride) pipe as a sampling device. The pipe was driven approximately 10–15 cm into the sediment, capped, and pulled up to the surface. Upon uncapping, the retained sediment was dispensed into a 50 ml sterile tube. Core samples were obtained through the EPA and private stakeholders during the feasibility study for the EPA Superfund site cleanup. The GPS coordinates of the fourteen sediment sample locations, as well as the core sample location and additional metadata are reported in Table S1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab (a) Map of sampling locations along the Gowanus Canal. The 14 surface sediment samples are marked with “+” signs, and the core sample location is marked with an arrow. (b) Process documentation shots of surface sediment sampling. Photo credit: Dave Rife.Sampling scheme Samples were collected from the sediment surface as well as one sediment core. Surface sediment samples were collected in 14 different locations along the length of the Canal, at two different timepoints (December 2014 and April 2015). These are samples from the top 15 cm of sediment, under 1–5 m of water. These will be referred to as “sediment samples” throughout this paper. Core samples were collected at a single location, from a core taken 3.5 m deep from the surface of the sediment, in 0.5 m depth increments (Fig. 1a for a map of these locations, and Fig. 1b for images of the process). These were collected from a core taken by the Department of Environmental Protection, and depth refers to the depth under the surface of the sediment. These will be referred to as “core samples.” See sample metadata in Table S1.DNA extraction and sequencing Sediment and core samples were stored at −80°C until processing. DNA was extracted using the MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (catalog no. 12888–50) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with 250 mg of starting material and lysis step performed on the Qiagen PowerLyzer (3 × 30 s agitation) then purified with Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter A63881). Sediment sample libraries were prepared using the Qiagen GeneRead DNA Library I Core Kit (180 432) with the Qiagen GeneRead DNA Library I Amp Kit (180455) along with Qiagen Adapter I Set A 12-plex (180985) and Qiagen Adapter I Set B 12-plex (180986) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. Core sample libraries were prepared with the Roche KAPA HyperPrep Kit (KK8504, 07962363 001) and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. For both platforms, paired-end 150 bp reads were generated, with an average of 26.5 million read pairs (53 million total reads) per sample. Sample metadata, including sequencing platform and read numbers are reported in Table S1.Bioinformatics analysis All bioinformatic analyses were performed on the High Performance Computing cluster at New York University. Preprocessing and AMR was calculated using the MetaSUB CAP pipeline (https://github.com/MetaSUB/MetaSUB_CAP) (Danko et al. 2021). Unless specified otherwise, default settings were used for the tools listed below.Preprocessing Shotgun metagenome raw sequence data, available as pair-end reads, was first processed with AdapterRemoval (v2.2.2) (Schubert et al. 2016), for the removal of low-quality reads and reads with ambiguous bases. This was followed by using Bowtie2 (v2.2.3) (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) for the alignment to the human genome (hg38, including alternate contigs). Read pairs where one or both ends mapped to the human genome were discarded while read pairs where neither mate mapped (referred to as “non-human reads” hereafter) were used for further analysis.Statistical analysis and visualization All statistical analysis and visualization was done in RStudio v4.1.2 (RStudio Team 2020). The statistical tests performed are reported in scripts (see github repository below) as well as figures. Packages used for plotting include Vennerable (Jia et al. 2021), igraph (Csárdi and Nepusz 2006), ggraph (Pedersen 2025), circlize (Gu et al. 2014), ggPlot2 (Wickham 2011), and RainCloudPlots (Allen et al. 2019). The code for the plots is available at https://github.com/HenaffLab/2023_Gowanus_Publication.Taxonomic assignment Non-human reads were used for taxonomic profiling using MetaPhlAn3 (v3.0.7) (Beghini et al. 2021), which produces species-level resolution using clade-specific marker genes for profiling taxonomy. MetaPhlAn was run with the flags “—add_viruses” to include viral markers and “—tax_lev ‘s’” to specify taxonomic resolution at the species level, with taxonomy distributions reported as relative abundance (Table S2).Dimensionality reduction Dimensionality reduction of taxonomic data was performed using the R package Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP) (Becht et al. 2019) as it not only preserves the global structure, but also performs a non-parametric mapping. In order to investigate sequencing depth as a factor in UMAP groupings (core samples were sequenced at higher depth that the Sediment samples, see Table S1 for read depths), we downsampled the core reads to the average sediment read depth to generate a normalized dataset. This normalized dataset also generates a similar UMAP plot as seen in Figure S2, and the full dataset was used for all subsequent analyses.Diversity metrics The R Vegan package (Dixon 2003) was used for calculation of diversity metrics. Alpha diversity was calculated using the Simpson and Shannon (also referred to as Shannon–Wiener) indices. The Simpson index or the dominance index accounts for the proportionality of a species in the sample. The Shannon–Wiener index takes into account the randomness present at the site. It also accounts for both the species’ equitability and richness. We report species richness which refers to the total number of different species present in an ecological community. We use Bray–Curtis dissimilarity to report Beta diversity, which quantifies the compositional differences between two sites, accounting for species counts. We use non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) for visualization of beta diversity using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity.Microbial species annotation We used The Microbe Directory v2 (TMD) (Shaaban et al. 2018, Sierra et al. 2019) to annotate species based on ecological and phenotypical features. TMD is a machine readable and hand curated database consisting of taxonomic annotation of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and eukaryotes. The features we reported include extremophilic nature, type of metabolism, and known microbiome isolation location. Automatic characterization of microbes remains challenging, and the breadth and depth of current TMD results can vary based on emerging literature and as more microbes are characterized and accessioned. We have used TMD v2 for characterizing most of the microbes referred to in Table S3, but for some species, we have collected additional literature review, which is referenced in the body of this manuscript.Bioremediation and metabolic studies Non-human reads were used to characterize metabolic function using the Human Microbiome Project Unified Metabolic Analysis Network3 (HUMAnN3) (v3.0.0.alpha.4) (Beghini et al. 2021), specifying DIAMOND (Buchfink et al. 2015) as the alignment algorithm and UniRef50 (Suzek et al. 2015) as the target database. This tool references the METACYC database for assembling pathways based on genes identified. We utilized the pathway abundances (Table S9) and the pathway coverage files for further analysis (all output files available with supplementary data at https://github.com/HenaffLab/2023_Gowanus_Publication). Pathway abundance values were normalized to copies per million and stratified using the script “humann_infer_taxonomy” provided by HUMAnN3, specifying resolution at the species level (Table S7). Following this, the pathways identified by HUMAnN3 were cross-referenced with the Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (http://eawag-bbd.ethz.ch) (Gao et al. 2010), to select pathways with bioremediation potential (Table S8).Antimicrobial resistance We generated AMR profiles by using non-human reads as input to MEGARES2 v1.0.1 using Bowtie2 v2.2.3 (—end-to-end mode, very-sensitive option). MEGARes includes an ontology to group resistance genes according to gene groups (Table S4) and AMR mechanisms (Table S5) and resistance classes (Table S6). The alignment was analyzed using Resistome Analyzer (commit 15a52dd to github.com/cdeanj/resistomeanalyzer) followed by normalization using reads per kilobase million per gene. This workflow is implemented as part of the CAP pipeline (Danko et al. 2021).Genome mining Biological Gene Clusters were identified using the BioSynthetic Spades option (“spades.py –bio”) within the Spades assembler (Bankevich et al. 2012) (v3.14.1). This option produces an assembly of the sample sequences (scaffolds.fasta) as well as an assembly enriched only for the classes of non-ribosomal (NRPS) and polyketide (PKS) gene clusters (gene_clusters.fasta). As we are looking to identify BGCs across all potential classes, we proceeded with the full assembly (scaffold.fasta) for the subsequent steps. This analysis was performed separately for each sample. The standalone version of AntiSMASH5 (v5.2.0) (Blin et al. 2019) was used for identification of BGCs in the assembled scaffolds, as well as their classification corresponding to specific types of SMs, and annotation based on similarity to entries in the database of BGCs with known output compounds MIBiG2 (Kautsar et al. 2020). We used prodigal (Hyatt et al. 2010) for gene finding and concentrated on bacteria as taxa. Full specified settings are “—genefinding-tool prodigal—taxon bacteria—cb-general—asf—smcog-trees—cb-knownclusters—cb-subclusters—pfam2go”. This analysis was also performed separately for each sample. We combined the AntiSMASH output from all the samples into a list of all BGCs identified across all samples, and used BiG-SCAPE/CORASON (Navarro-Muñoz et al. 2020) to generate gene cluster families according to structural characteristics (using similarity networks) and sequence characteristics (using the Pfam directory). We also used Big-SCAPE to also annotate the families which encode a product similar to the known products in MIBiG2 using the “—mibig” setting.Results Microbial community characteristics as related to environmental context Microbial community metrics Species abundance was computed for all the samples. Kendall correlation (Fig. S1) shows groupings of Gowanus samples into two broad sets, the Core Samples and the Sediment Samples. UMAP dimensional reduction (Fig. 2a) reflects a differential distribution of species based on both location and data type, and groups the samples as Core, Sediment_Winter14 and Sediment_Spring_15, with an overlap between the two Sediment samples. In order to investigate sequencing depth as a factor in this grouping (Core samples were sequenced at higher depth that the Sediment samples, see Table S1 for read depths), we downsampled the Core reads to the average Sediment read depth to generate a normalized dataset. This normalized dataset also generates a similar UMAP plot as seen in Fig. S2, and the full dataset was used for all subsequent analyses. Of a total of 455 species identified across all samples (Table S2), we identified including 13 archaeal species, 241 species of bacteria, and 201 viruses/phages. Of these, 85 species are shared across all the 3 sample sets, and the 2 sediment sample sets share 128 species (Fig. 2d). Figure 2.

Ellipses represent 99.99% confidence intervals. (c) Alpha Diversity according to Shannon and Simpson indices. Each plot includes a scatter plot, a box plot, and a half violin plot. (d) Venn Diagram of species identified across different sample sets.We next evaluated intra-sample alpha and beta taxonomic diversity of our collections. We found that samples from the Core set were different from Sediment samples with lower alpha-diversity (Fig. 2c). While the Shannon index accounts for species richness by including rare species, the Simpson index gives more weight to evenness and common species. Both metrics are independent of group size, therefore the uneven distribution of sample numbers in Core and Sediment sets does not affect the alpha diversity metric (Roswell et al. 2021). Shannon [Kruskal–Wallis, chi-squared = 16.202, P-value = 0.0003033] and Simpson indices [Kruskal–Wallis, chi-squared = 16.022, P-value = 0.0003318] attain statistical significance. Beta-diversity was calculated by Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index and scaled using NDMS (Fig. 2b). The NDMS plot of the taxonomic profiles showed slight separation between the two groups of Sediment sample sets; however, these differences were minor. The samples in the Core set are different from the samples in the Sediment set according to this metric, also previously observed in the UMAP plot (Fig. 2a).Species characterization according to environmental and historical context Marine organisms related to geographic environment Originally in a productive tidal estuary stewarded by the Lenni Lenape people for over 9000 years before colonial contact (Doyle 1996), the present-day environment of the canal is a combination of original sediment, over 150 years of industrial waste, inputs from surrounding runoff and combined sewage overflows (CSOs), and tidal influx. Accordingly, many species found in the Gowanus Canal were previously identified in either marine or freshwater sediment, water or soil. (See Methods for microbial characterization strategies.) Marine sediment species identified include Modestobacter marinus [also radiation-tolerant (Normand et al. 2012)], Labilibaculum filiforme, Draconibacterium orientale (Du et al. 2014), Maribacter arcticus, Sedimentitalea nanhaiensis, Halioglobus lutimaris, Shimia aestuarii, and Thiobacillus denitrificans; and Planktomarina temperata from sea water. Fewer freshwater sediment species were identified, including Methanobacterium lacus and Xanthobacter autotrophicus. Known soil microbes identified include Micrococcus aloeverae and Mycolicibacterium chubuense.Extremophiles related to contamination Given their high concentrations of contaminants, Superfund sites are considered to be extreme environments (Tighe et al. 2017). We identified a number of extremophiles in the Canal, including psychrophilic, thermophilic, and halophilic organisms. Psychrophiles (cryophiles) are organisms capable of surviving in low temperatures especially in deep sea beds and sediments. We identified psychrophiles such as Cryobacterium arcticum (Bajerski et al. 2011), Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus, Hyphomonas jannaschiana (also a barophile), Labilibaculum filiforme, Ma. arcticus, and Thiobacillus denitrificans. The EPA and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation has classified Gowanus as Class SD type saline environment (GEI Consultants 2009). Consistent with this, we observed halophiles, defined as organisms tolerant to hyper saline environments, including Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, Mi. aloeverae (also an alkaliphile), Se. nanhaiensis, and Vibrio diazotrophicus. We also observed a few thermophiles which are organisms adapted for survival in higher temperatures such as Lachnospira pectinoschiza and Thermoleophilum album. On a species level, some of the extremotolerant organisms identified are known for their bioremediation properties. Microbacterium laevaniformans, which has been identified across multiple samples, has previously been isolated from areas contaminated with heavy metals (Brown et al. 2012).Microbial species related to the human gut Consistent with the frequent CSO from the 11 sewage outfalls (see report “Gowanus Canal—DEP” by U.S. EPA 2025) that can release untreated waste into the Canal, we have identified species usually associated with the human gut. In the following list of species, those known for their potential for developing resistance to clinically used antimicrobial drugs are starred (*). These include Gram-negative bacteria like Acinetobacter johnsonii, Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Gemmiger formicilis, and Tyzzerella nexilis and Gram-positive human gastrointestinal bacteria, including Clostridium leptum, Anaerostipes hadrus, Blautia obeum, Holdemanella biformis, Bulleidia extructa*, Collinsella aerofaciens*, Collinsella intestinalis*, ​​Enorma massiliensis*, Gardnerella vaginalis*, Mycobacterium gordonae*, Lach. pectinoschiza*, and Streptococcus salivarius*. Lactobacillus animalis* also isolated from the Canal, is a commonly consumed probiotic. Archaeal commensal species known to be components of the gut microbiome were identified, including Methanobrevibacter smithii* and Methanobacterium formicicum. See Table S3 for annotation of microbial characteristics generated through the Microbe Directory (Sierra et al. 2019).Gowanus canal as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance Investigating further the potential for the Gowanus Canal to be a reservoir of AMR, we characterized the known classes and mechanisms using the database MEGARes (Table S4 for list of genes associated with AMR, Table S5 for their mechanisms and Table S6 for their classification). We identified 28 genes within 8 classes of antibiotic resistance, the major ones being Rifamycin (which includes Rifampin) and Aminoglycosides, and others, including Tetracyclines, Elfamycins, Phenicol, Sulfonamides, Multi-Drug Resistance, and MLS as shown in Figure S3a. Of these, the most frequently identified gene (ARO:3 003 465, confiring rifampicin resistance) has been identified in 15 out of the 37 samples. The common drug-class mechanisms through which the above noted genes confer resistance is shown in Figure S3b. The above analysis attributes genus-level classification when possible to the identified genes, and in this analysis, two of the AMR genes were attributed to Mycobacterium (one Aminoglycoside and one Rifampin, Table S4). While we might assume that these AMR all come from human gut species as those flagged above, some environmental species identified in this dataset are known to harbor resistance genes as well. These include species previously isolated from water and sediment such as the sulfate-reducing Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus and Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, as well as Thermoleophilum album, Se. nanhaiensis, My. gilvum, and My. fallax. Other species potentially harboring AMR have been previously isolated from soil (My. chubuense and My. obuense), and plants (Mi. aloeverae) (Prakash et al. 2014).Characterization of bioremediation metabolisms Bioremediation pathways overview To further understand the relationship between the Canal microbiome and its environment, we classified metabolic pathways as defined by the MetaCYC (Caspi et al. 2020) database using the software HumanN3 (Beghini et al. 2021), (Table S7 for pathway list). Among them, we identified 64 pathways related to the Canal’s history of contamination, using the list of biotransformation pathways compiled by EAWAG (Gao et al. 2010) as keywords. Among these, 61 pathways fall within the MetaCyc superclass of Degradation/Utilization/Assimilation (DUA), two pathways belonging to the Biosynthesis superclass and one in Detoxification (Table S8). Within the DUA superclass, Aromatic Degradation is the most represented with 52 pathways, including compounds of historical relevance such as toluene, cresols, catechol and phenolic compounds (Fig. 3a). Figure 3. Open in a new tab (a) Relative abundance of metabolic pathways identified across all samples related to aromatic compound degradation (within the sub-class of DUA). (b) Correlation plot depicting the subset of pathways within the class of Aromatic Compound Degradation that were attributed to specific species.Bioremediation pathways of historical relevance and potential biotech applications Aromatic compound degradation Within the Aromatic Degradation class, toluene degradation is the most prevalent subclass (28%), followed by catechol (23%) and phenolic compound degradation (12%) (Fig. 3a). Seven of the bioremediation pathways were attributed to specific microbial species (7 species) (Fig. 3b). In two cases, we observe a one-to-many relationship: a given pathway is attributed to multiple species (e.g. “4-methylcatechol degradation” is associated to My. chlorophenicum and Mycobacterium sp Root135) and in one case, a many-to-one, i.e. a given species is associated with multiple pathways (e.g. Cycloclasticus zancles is associated to “catechol degradation to 2-oxopent-4-enoate II”, “catechol degradation I”, and “catechol degradation II”). In three cases, we observe a one-to-one relationship. Most of the pathways identified here are related to compounds identified by the EPA Superfund study (see report “Gowanus Canal Site Profile” by U.S. EPA 2025); however, some metabolisms relate to compounds that are not reported in this assessment, such as the PAHs mandelate and gallate. Besides aromatic compound degradation, the DUA pathways identified also fall in the C1 compound (Lee et al. 2019) utilization and alcohol degradation classes. Relevant to historical contaminants, these include formaldehyde assimilation, also not listed in the EPA site profile report.Heavy metal superstar In addition to organic contaminants, we assessed the metabolic potential of the Gowanus Canal microbiome for response to inorganic contaminants, specifically heavy metals. Of the 2 808 569 total genes identified by HumanN3 (available at https://github.com/HenaffLab/2023_Gowanus_Publication), 3153 encode proteins that are associated with heavy metals, with the largest number of genes associated with Iron (1743 genes) followed by Cobalt (446), Copper (441), and Nickel (286). Cadmium, Chromate, Lead, Mercury, Vanadium, Arsenic, and Aluminum all counted <100 genes for a given metal. Mechanisms include resistance (141 genes), oxidation/reduction (299), chelation (88), efflux (43), transport (939), and binding (752) (Table S10). Of the 3153 total metal-associated genes, 1172 are associated with one or more of 201 unique bacterial species (Table S12). Some of these species are associated with a large number of these genes, covering multiple metals (top species are Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, Methanobacterium lacus, Desulfococcus oleovorans, Ruminococcus torques, Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus, Methanosarcina_sp_MTP4, each encoding more than 20 metal related genes).BGC discovery Our approach to BGC discovery differs from the sequence similarity based functional analyses described above, since our method (1) identifies gene cluster structures in genomic data, as well as the sequence characteristics, and (2) utilizes assembled scaffolded contigs, rather than using single reads. SM compounds were divided into six classes depending on their biosynthetic origin: polyketides (PKs), non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs), Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), terpenoids, saccharides, and indole alkaloids (Keller et al. 2005, Medema et al. 2015). Overall, we identified 2319 assembled BGCs in our 37 total samples, including both sediment and core samples [using AntiSMASH5 (Blin et al. 2019) on assembled contigs, see Methods for more details]. Of the 2319 assembled BGCs, 1600 (69%) were classified into 5 predominant classes [using Big-SCAPE (Navarro-Muñoz et al. 2020), which represents a broad range of structural classes], with the remaining 719 unclassified (31%). The SM classes identified include Polyketides (PKS1 and PKSOthers, 18%), Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified Peptides (RiPPs, 21%), followed by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS, 15%), Terpenes (14%), and PKS-NRP Hybrids (<1%). BGCs can be grouped into gene cluster families (GCFs, or “families” hereon) that are functionally closely related and encode the production of the same or very similar molecules, which Big-SCAPE characterizes according to structural and sequence characteristics. Of the 2319 BGCs identified in our samples, 44% (1005) exhibited homology with at least one other BGC, grouping into 309 families, while 56% (1314) were singletons (considered as 1314 families of one). These total to 1623 families defining the 2319 total gene clusters identified (Fig. 4a). The largest family counts 28 BGCs, found in the group PKSOthers, followed by 12 in the RiPPs group. The average number of BGCs per family is 1 or 2 in every group. Figure 4. Open in a new tab (a) Stacked bar plot representing the number of BGC families by BGC class, differentiating singleton and non-singleton families. (b) Subset of gene cluster families characterized according to the MIBiG reference. Circle size depicts the number of BGCs belonging to the family, the color represents the type of BGC, position along the X axis depicts functional genes identified.While many families of BGCs have been computationally defined, few have been associated with specific SM compounds experimentally. The Minimum Information about a BGC (MIBiG 2.0) database (Kautsar et al. 2020) records such BGCs with known outputs, and among the 1623 families in our dataset, 13 of these display high similarity (>80%) with BGCs in MiBIG (calculated as the % of genes in the query cluster that have significant BLAST hits with a gene in the target cluster) (Fig. 4b). The remaining 1610 are not associated with a specific compound, and could potentially encode unknown (novel) compounds.Discussion Here, we present the first in-depth metagenomic study of the Gowanus Canal, a Superfund site embedded in a residential/light manufacturing neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, USA. Taxonomic classification shows that this contaminated environment hosts a rich and diverse microbial population. The composition of this community includes species previously identified in marine sediment, as well as the human gut, reflecting both the estuarine environment and the presence of CSO outfalls. Collectively, the microbiome of the canal encodes a wide range of antimicrobial resistance genes, including some related to human pharmaceutical use. While some AMR alleles come from human gut species, some environmental species identified in this dataset are also known to harbor resistance genes. These include species previously isolated from water and sediment such as the sulfate-reducing Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus and Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, as well as Thermoleophilum album, Se. nanhaiensis, My. gilvum, and My. fallax. Other species potentially harboring AMR have been previously isolated from soil (My. chubuense and My. obuense), and plants (Mi. aloeverae). Of note, the material sampled in this study was sediment and this substrate contained both human gut related microbes as well as human related AMRs. This means that to a certain extent, human gut microbes from untreated waste streams are persisting in the sediment. Further research could address the fate of waste stream related microbes in the environment, their interactions with chemical contaminants, and the potential of CSOs to develop environmental AMR reservoirs. Recently literature has accumulated that points to contaminants’ effect on ARG persistence in the environment (Fletcher 2015), including historical industrial contaminants as well as emerging organic contaminants (Alderton et al. 2021). One such mechanism for this impact is that the prevalence of ARGs carried by live bacteria is impacted by the selection pressures their hosts are subject to (Mathur et al. 2018). Microbes evolve faster under stress (Li et al. 2014), and the Canal microbiome has been challenged with industrial contaminants since before the canal was dredged in 1853. We assessed the potential for this microbiome to be a reservoir of remediation-related functions through functional analysis, identifying gene coding potential and metabolic pathways encoded in this dataset. We identified bioremediation pathways related to degradation of VOCs and complex hydrocarbons, consistent with the historical industries of coal extraction and paint making at the site (Miller 2015). Interestingly, our data suggests that a given microbial species usually uses multiple mechanisms for degradation of a particular aromatic compound, and targets just one group of hydrocarbons. For example, Pseudomonas fluorescens encodes degradation of catechol through three pathways, including meta-cleavage and through the intermediate 2-oxoent-4-enoate. We also identified gene interactions related to heavy metals. In the case of metal related functions, a given species may encode molecular functionality related to multiple metals. Top species are Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, Methanobacterium lacus, Desulfococcus oleovorans, Ruminococcus torques, Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus, Methanosarcina_sp_MTP4, each encoding more than 20 metal related genes. While heavy metals are essential cofactors in many cellular processes, high heavy metal concentrations are also a stressor and microbes adapt by developing resistance mechanisms, including chelation and efflux (Anastassopoulou and Theophanides 1995, Lemire et al. 2013, Oves and Khan 2016, Panda et al. 2021). As such, these resistance mechanisms can be applied to biotech applications such as remediation through biosorption and bioaccumulation (Chojnacka 2010). Additionally, there is an interesting potential for using microbial mechanisms to recover rare earth metals from contaminated environments, as these metals are both contaminant and valuable resource (Jyothi et al. 2020). These studies encourage further research to gain insight on the biochemical potential of Superfund sites from the perspective of remediation and resource recovery. The current gold standard for characterization of new SMs is through metabolomic discovery. However, recent efforts to identify useful SMs leverage computational methods to mine metagenomic datasets for BGCs. These efforts are concentrating on soils as environments with potential for pharmacologically relevant molecules (Charlop-Powers et al. 2016, Negri et al. 2022, Waschulin et al. 2022) and on human body environments with potential to relate to disease phenotypes (Donia et al. 2014, Aleti et al. 2019). Here, we show that the Gowanus Canal depicts its own microenvironment encoding novel BGCs. This distribution of BGC families mirrors that reported by Nayfach et al. (2021) for the “bioremediation” category, as compared with other sources including aquatic, wastewater or terrestrial environments. The BGC family distribution observed in the Gowanus, however, differs from that reported in another Superfund site in Vermont, the Ely Copper Mines (Giddings et al. 2020). Indeed, the top two classes of the BGCs in Ely Copper Mines included NRPS and Terpenes. Of note, water and sediment can often have separate BGC profiles such as those described by Nayfach et al., and those from Lake Hillier, a hypersaline environment with distinctive pink color (Sierra et al. 2022). This signifies that irrespective of similarities between multiple extreme environments, the BGC characterization of each environment is unique. The results detailed in this manuscript point to the microbiome of the Gowanus Canal, an urban EPA Superfund site, as a reservoir for microbial mechanisms potentially important for biotechnological applications. Indeed, these microbes harbor bioremediation functions, degrading complex hydrocarbons as well as fixing heavy metals while also surviving in extreme conditions as a complex community. These functions can be seen as a resource, and further studied for potential biotechnological and engineering applications. One can imagine at least two avenues for augmenting the bioremediation potential of this resident microbiome. On one hand, one can isolate and characterize specific strains with functions of interest and culture them in bioreactors (Navina et al. 2024), perhaps engineering them to overexpress these genes for accelerated degradation (Dangi et al. 2019). This can be implemented in treating isolated waste, but poses challenges when scaling up and/or releasing genetically engineered strains into the environment (Navina et al. 2024). On the other hand, one can consider altering the environment in which these consortia have evolved, to help overcome limiting steps or apply principles of directed evolution. This has been successfully implemented in the context of microbial treatment of wastewater (Saravanan et al. 2023a), and biochar has been shown to effectively augment bioremediation performance due to its properties in altering microbial habitats on a micro scale (Saravanan et al. 2023b). Moving forward with either of these options requires considering the ethics of interventions on non-human organisms, because even though we can’t relate to microbes in the way we can to beasts of burden, “harnessing” them still implies making resources through labor (Krzywoszynska 2020). This work shows the co-occurence of ARGs and bioremediation metabolisms, and exciting future perspectives emerge from this research. In particular, an open question posed by this work and to be addressed in future studies is: what is the impact of industrial contaminants on the persistence of antimicrobial resistance genes in environmental reservoirs? These results outline the potential of this Superfund site and other contaminated sites across the world to be case studies to uncover the mechanics of interactions between antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination, and microbial community dynamics. We anticipate to follow up with this work with long-read sequencing approaches, contaminant quantifications, and co-culture experiments that would be able to reveal interactions within the consortia and their impact on metabolisms and ARG persistence.Conclusion Once an ecologically diverse estuary and home to the Lenni-Lenape people, the Gowanus Creek was dredged in 1853 as part of ongoing colonial and industrial disruption to the land to become the Gowanus Canal. Its environment today is emblematic of the many post-industrial Superfund sites across the country. Like Gowanus, many of these locations were important sites for production and manufacturing industries that have now moved elsewhere leaving a material, economic, and social legacy of toxicity not only in the canal itself but also the surrounding areas As a result of the EPA’s remediation proposals (U.S. EPA 2012), the communities surrounding the Gowanus Canal (notably, those historically disproportionately affected by the contaminated environment) are now vulnerable to residential displacement, and deepening economic inequality (Krisel 2015) in addition to ongoing possible toxic exposure. The Gowanus Canal is considered a forsaken environment from our human perspective: the Superfund cleanup plan is to dredge the canal and cap it with an impermeable layer. Yet, this study shows that this environment is thriving from a microbial perspective. These microbes have evolved to survive harsh conditions, and have shown capability of not only remediate contaminants in the environment, but also produce novel SMs. These data show there is still much we can learn from these lifeforms who have evolved to inhabit industrial ruins. At a time where human disturbance has become a geological force, these results further suggest that we should redefine our relationship to the lifeforms we live amongst, with a responsibility for stewardship and reciprocity. These microscopic neighbors not only serve as a genetic catalog of bioremediation functions, but open our imagination to new modes of what theorist Anna Tsing calls “collaborative survival”—of ways to live together on a damaged planet (Tsing 2015).Supplementary Material lxaf076_Supplemental_Files lxaf076_supplemental_files.zip (1MB, zip) Acknowledgments This work was supported in part through the NYU IT High Performance Computing resources, services, and staff expertise.

    "abstract": "Abstract Over the past 30 years, organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have emerged as a robust alternative to address the technological challenges associated with current in vitro and in vivo options. Although OOCs offer improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity, broad adoption has remained limited. Most approaches to characterize on-chip structure and function require human intervention, limiting device translation and feasibility. Here, we introduce a new fiber optic-based sensing platform that enables automated, temporal luminescence sensing on-chip, validated for real-time readout of epithelial and endothelial barrier function under cytokine-induced inflammation. Our platform, capable of at least 1 μM resolution, tracked paracellular transport in situ for 9 days of culture under perfusion on-chip. These results offer an alternative sensing approach for continuous, non-invasive luminescence monitoring in OOCs.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have significantly advanced human disease modelling and drug development, offering improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity by integrating physical and chemical stimuli matched to physiologically relevant conditions.1–4 Although significant innovations have been made toward recreating organ-specific physiology on chip, the methods available to study the structure and function of the cell microenvironment are still limited.5–7 Established analysis approaches, such as fluorescence microscopy, often rely on laborious offline workflows that yield acute or terminal time-point data.8,9 These complex techniques require substantial manual perturbations, frequently adding environmental and user-based variability to inherently inconsistent biological samples. As the OOC field continues to evolve, there is a unique opportunity to engineer improved in situ characterization methods into organ-chip devices. It is essential to develop novel approaches that address current limitations and enable real-time readout of relevant physiological parameters in OOCs to improve the reliability and robustness of these systems. Electrochemical and optical methods are the most common approaches for integrated sensing on-chip. Numerous demonstrations of electrochemical sensors have been integrated into OOC, showing high sensitivity and specificity for a range of analytes, including pH, oxygen concentration, glucose, and lactate.10–14 Electrochemical methods have also been adapted for structural characterization of the microenvironment, tracking transient changes in barrier permeability, cell health, and differentiation state throughout culture on-chip.15–17 Van der Helm et al. integrated plated electrodes on-chip for impedance spectroscopy measurements of Caco-2 monolayers differentiated on-chip.17 Although electrochemical methods offer continuous, real-time data from the on-chip microenvironment, these approaches suffer from high costs resulting from complicated fabrication workflows for sensor integration and relatively rapid sensor fouling or site saturation.5,18 Broad adoption of OOCs will require inexpensive consumable culture ware paired with reusable sensor technologies. Optical interrogation methods have been the standard for characterizing the on-chip microenvironment, enabling direct visualization of cell structure and quantitative outputs, including viability and protein expression.7,19,20 Optical and fluorescence microscopy techniques offer non-invasive and non-destructive characterization of cellular dynamics on-chip, including oxygen consumption, calcium signalling, and barrier permeability.21–24 In a multi-organ chip system, Novak et al. tracked the distribution of inulin-FITC tracer dye with an automated fluorescence microscopy platform, demonstrating repeatable concentration profiles for each of eight organ models over 3 weeks.21 However, most experimental procedures are limited to single OOC setups and require human intervention for timepoint data collection. These requirements limit utility in drug development where high throughput is needed or requires expensive, high-content imaging systems.5,9 Recent work has attempted to address this issue by automating organ-chip handling or miniaturizing optical components for direct integration.18,21 Integrated sensing approaches are an attractive option for non-invasive characterization, combining the benefit of direct optical sensing with continuous, automated outputs.18,25,26 Despite the advantages of fully integrated optical sensing, most approaches are not amenable to on-chip integration due to the bulky equipment required for directing beam paths or the complexity of the organ-chip system used. We sought to develop a fiber optic-based sensing system to enable fully integrated on-chip sensing, isolating optical components from the sample of interest by transmitting signals across fiber optic cables. Optical cables allowing for bidirectional light transmission are coupled to high-powered LEDs, simultaneously delivering excitation and recording emitted wavelengths to a CMOS camera or photomultiplier tube. The system collects signal as an aggregate sum of luminescence from the excited area, significantly increasing the signal-to-noise ratio but sacrificing single-cell resolution. Our technology presents the unique opportunity to integrate optical fibers on-chip for in situ characterization of the cellular microenvironment using luminescent probes. We are the first to translate this technology to OOCs for in situ optical sensing. While other attempts have been made to enable real-time, fiber-optic-based fluorescence sensing in an organ chip, these approaches are limited to readout of oxygen concentration and pH only, using commercial systems with limited spectral range.25,26 To our knowledge, our fiber-based system is the first to enable real-time, spatiotemporal sensing across the visible luminescence spectrum in OOCs. Physiological barriers, for example, the intestinal epithelium and vascular endothelium, selectively regulate the flux of water, ions, and nutrients while preventing the passage of bacteria and pathogens.15,27 Disruption of barrier function in vivo leads to uninhibited, non-selective transport across the barrier and is associated with the pathophysiology of human diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease.28 In OOC systems, barrier function is commonly assessed using trans-epithelial/endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values.29–31 TEER is traditionally measured using an applied alternating current across a monolayer to determine the total ohmic resistance. Although TEER is a convenient method for characterizing barrier function on-chip, the current density applied across the barrier is dependent on electrode spatial configuration. Unequal distribution of current density across the barrier can lead to an over or underestimation of the actual TEER value. Further, with OOC platforms varying in size, shape, and orientation, it is difficult to translate measured values across systems without significant computational effort.17 Here, we report a novel optical sensing platform for automated, non-invasive sensing of barrier function in OOCs under baseline and perturbed conditions. Specifically, we validated our photometry-based platform by monitoring epithelial and endothelial cell responses to induced inflammation on-chip. This is the first report on applying photometry-based technology to OOC, offering a novel approach to study the on-chip environment in real-time, expanding on the current capabilities of optical microscopy and end-point analyses.",

    "results": "Results and discussion Fiber photometry platform and optical fiber integration Our previously established layer-by-layer gut-on-a-chip32,33 was adapted to add fiber optic insertion channels to the upper and lower fluidic layers (Fig. 1A and C). The 500 μm wide fiber channels were positioned at the outlets to detect the exit concentration of fluorophore from each fluidic layer. A 500 μm thick PMMA wall separates the fluidic channel from the fiber insertion channel for complete separation of the optical components from the culture volume. With the terminal end of the fiber optic cable in proximity (∼500 μm or less) to the culture volume of interest, excitation and emission luminescence may be sensed with a high signal-to-noise ratio, offering non-invasive delivery and collection of light with 92% visible light transmission.35 10 mm long fiber optic stubs were inserted into the channels for non-invasive sensing, delivering excitation light to the culture volume and receiving emitted light (Fig. 1B). Preliminary design testing found that orienting the fiber stubs perpendicular to the side of the culture flow channels was most effective when sensing both apical and basal fluorescence at the outlet of the chip without channel crosstalk. Other design configurations, such as positioning the excitation from the top-down, offered reasonable sensitivity despite increased measurement variability by attenuation through the cell monolayer and membrane. This optical sensing approach may be easily adapted to additional organ-chip designs and orientations, enabling optical sensing across numerous OOC models. Most OOC are fabricated from optically transparent materials for microscopy, commonly poly-dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) or thermoplastics, allowing direct adaptation to a photometry-based sensing approach. This approach enables the sensing components (ferrule coupled fiber stubs) to be reused over long lifespans and rapidly swapped between OOCs compared to embedded electrodes. Fig. 1. Optical sensing organ-on-a-chip system. A) A fabricated chip with apical and basal fiber optical ports indicated. B) An assembled chip with optical fibers inserted for noninvasive real-time sensing. Both apical and basal fibers are illuminated with 470 nm light to exhibit the excitation volume. C) An exploded view of each layer used to fabricate platform. Optical fibers may be inserted in the apical and/or basal flow layer without disrupting cell culture or flow, as shown. Open in a new tab Sensing setup and automation The fiber photometry platform utilized for barrier sensing was assembled as a mirror image, enabling independent sensing of upper and lower fluidic compartments of each OOC (Fig. 2A and S1†)—bundled fiber optic cables allowed for sensing from up to 7 OOC simultaneously. Three OOCs were cultured concurrently (1 control, 2 experimental). For multiplexed sensing, excitation light for both λs was directed through the same fiber with a 3 second delay between channels to avoid spectral overlap. Collected emission was directed to independent cameras for λ-specific signal analysis (Fig. S2†). For both barrier sensing and multiplexed sensing, fiber optic cables were routed into an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for non-invasive sensing from up to three OOCs simultaneously (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2. Fiber photometry system for optical sensing on-chip. A) Components consist of high-powered LEDs, optical filters, fiber optic cables, and CMOS cameras that simultaneously deliver excitation light and record emission from fluorophores on-chip. B) A laptop and Arduino microcontroller are used to automate LED power and image capturing. Fiber optic cables transmit excitation and emission wavelengths with minimal loss from within the incubator to the external hardware. Open in a new tabTo ensure cross-chip consistency, the intensity of light emitted from each fiber end was measured at 400 mA LED power, which was used for all sensing experiments. The measured intensity was 0.25 ± 0.04 mW cm−2, with a maximum difference of 20.3% from the mean intensity (Fig. S3†). Limiting intensity variation across individual fibers improves sensitivity and consistency when measuring across multiple OOCs since the excitation power is directly proportional to the collected emission signal. Maintaining output intensities within a reasonable range narrows the emission signal, allowing for optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio when first implementing the platform. In our experience, large variations in excitation power across fibers (>50%) may saturate some channels before acceptable signal-to-noise is achieved for other channels. The platform was connected to an Arduino microcontroller to automate and synchronize image capture with fluorophore excitation. Our custom Arduino program sent 200 ms LED excitation pulses on-chip every 10 minutes to capture time-dependent diffusion data with minimal photobleaching. Timestamped images were automatically captured by a TTL trigger sent to the CMOS camera during excitation. Microcontroller-aligned LED and camera triggers enabled completely hands-free data collection of on-chip data throughout complete experimental timelines, requiring only initial setup and baseline image collection by hand. Our compact setup, consisting of the photometry optical equipment, an Arduino microcontroller, and a laptop, enables sensing on-chip in a small footprint essential for research labs with limited free space. A preliminary calibration curve was constructed by dosing known concentrations of lucifer yellow in DPBS on blank chips to determine the relative sensing range of our optical sensing platform. Emitted fluorescence was recorded by our optical sensing platform and normalized to blanks chips containing only DPBS. The resulting calibration curve shows a robust linear relationship between fluorophore concentration and measured fluorescence, capable of detection to as low as 1 μM on-chip (R2 = 0.998, Fig. S4†). Inflammation-induced disruption and recovery of Caco-2 cells on-chip To establish the resolution of our system to measure small changes in barrier integrity, we aim to mimic an inflamed gut. A pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail was added to Caco-2 monolayers, first on semi-permeable inserts, to increase permeability without fully disrupting the cell population. Caco-2 monolayers grown for at least 21 days on filter inserts were subjected to TNF-α (200 ng mL−1), IFN-γ (200 ng mL−1), and IL-1β (100 ng mL−1) for 4 days. Cytokines were removed, and monolayers were allowed to recover for up to 5 days. Compared to control monolayers on the same day of culture, monolayers exposed to the cytokine cocktail showed a significant (p = 0.0003) increase in permeability on day 4 of inflammation and significant (p = 0.0231) recovery of barrier function 2 days after cytokine removal (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4. A) Graphical description of effluent- and photometry-based barrier function assays. Effluent was collected from chips daily and fluorescence was measured via plate reader. Fiber photometry readings were collected automatically by our novel platform. B) Relative permeability of Caco-2 monolayers exposed to the cytokine cocktail (TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-1b) on day 0.

D) Basal sensed fluorescence difference from control sensed by fiber photometry during Caco-2 monolayer inflammation and recovery.

Data is shown as mean (black) ± standard deviation (grey). n = 3, m = 3 control, 5 experimental replicates. Dotted vertical line represents the removal of the cytokine cocktail. Open in a new tabThe described cytokine concentrations were used for inflammation of Caco-2 on-chip. Caco-2 cells were cultured on-chip for 7 days under continuous perfusion at 3 μL min−1 (0.076 dyne per cm2), mimicking physiological shear stress in the intestine.3,36 Our previous work has demonstrated epithelial maturity on-chip at this timepoint. We then dosed a pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail composed of TNF-α (200 ng mL−1), IFN-γ (200 ng mL−1), and IL-1β (100 ng mL−1) to induce inflammation on-chip (Fig. 3A and B). Fig. 3. Experimental overview for real-time barrier function sensing on-chip. A) Fiber optic cables detect fluorescence from apical and basolateral chambers in our gut-on-a-chip. Inflammation was induced in mature epithelial monolayers (left), resulting in barrier disruption and increased fluorophore transport (right). B) Timeline for cytokine-induced inflammation in our gut-on-a-chip. Cells formed a mature monolayer after 7 days of culture under continuous flow. On day 0, the paracellular permeability marker lucifer yellow was added to apical media and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-1b) were dosed via basal media. Barrier function was tracked by our sensing platform. Open in a new tabBarrier function was continuously assessed by our novel sensing platform and by daily collection of chip effluent (Fig. 4A). Comparison of sensed and sampled fluorescence shows good agreement, with similar response time to the addition and removal of the pro-inflammatory cocktail (Fig. 4C). The mean increase in barrier permeability across experimental replicates (n = 5) is relatively consistent despite some distinct peaks caused by effluent sampling and syringe exchange on day 4 (Fig. 4D). Our sensing platform is robust and capable of automated data collection over at least 9 days with consistent outputs from independent experimental replicates. Further, data collected using our platform enabled real-time readout of barrier function over the 9 day experimental time course. Real-time, optical readout of barrier function in OOC has not previously been reported. Compared to daily effluent sampling, we significantly increased the temporal resolution of cellular responses to induced inflammation on-chip, observing a continuous, gradual increase in barrier permeability earlier than daily effluent sampling (Fig. 4C). Further, a change in permeability is observed as early as shortly after the day 2 sampling timepoint (Fig. 4D), while no discernible change in permeability presents till day 4 for effluent sampling. Application of this approach to time-dependent assays on shorter experimental timescales may significantly improve temporal resolution, increase sensitivity, and data quality. Effluent and sensed barrier function corroborate that the Caco-2 monolayer underwent inflammation in response to the dosed cytokine cocktail. Still, the level and kinetics of recovery did not match that observed in filter inserts; however, prolonged barrier integrity disruption measured on-chip, effluent, and optical measures matched. Qualitatively, immunofluorescence imaging suggests that the barrier had recovered partially, indicated by qualitative reorganization of ZO-1 expression to cell–cell junctions (Fig. 5). Fig. 5. Representative immunocytochemistry results on-chip from control (left column), 96 hour cytokine exposure (center column), and 120 hour recovery (right column) groups. Comparison of tight-junction expression (ZO-1) shows more diffuse expression in inflamed monolayers compared to control and recovery. Images taken at 40× magnification, maximum intensity projection of 10-slice z-stack. Open in a new tabQuantitative analysis of collected effluent and sensed data show that barrier permeability was significantly increased compared to controls from day 6 until the experiment ended. The absence of native stem cells and immune cells in this gut-on-a-chip model may prevent complete recovery from induced inflammation.37–39 Our lab has previously demonstrated that Caco-2 cells cultured on our gut-on-a-chip differentiate in 5 days, exhibiting polarization and brush borders comparable to mature epithelium.30,32 Continuous perfusion provides physiological shear stress, continuous nutrient supply, and waste removal, whereas static cultures receive fresh media intermittently. Mechanical shear stress may influence proliferation and the restructuring of tight-junctions, resulting in the differences in recovery observed across filter insert and on-chip systems (Fig. 4B and C).40–42 After cytokine-induced inflammation of differentiated Caco-2 monolayers, tight junctions must undergo replication and reorganization to return to a healthy, functional morphology.40,41 Caco-2 cultured on filter inserts may high a higher propensity to proliferate and restructure more rapidly compared to on-chip due to the lack of fluidic shear stress, as reflected in our experiments. Although previous work indicates that tight-junction reorganization and recovery on-chip is possible in less than 24 hours, these studies induced acute barrier dysfunction by the chelating agent EGTA.43,44 To our knowledge, we are the first to report on the recovery response of Caco-2 on-chip following chronically induced barrier inflammation. Additionally, excess cytokines may have remained present during the recovery phase due to the diffusion-dependent clearing of cytokines from the on-chip microenvironment. Unlike typical culture approaches that allow washing the monolayer, the cytokines could not be thoroughly flushed from the system due to the risk of destroying the fragile, inflamed monolayer under higher shear stress. The differences between filter inserts and on-chip experiments further support this hypothesis: monolayers cultured on filter inserts showed significant recovery only 48 hours after cytokine removal. In comparison, the OOC monolayers showed no significant decrease in permeability after 96 hours (Fig. 4B and C). A shift from increasing barrier permeability to constant, elevated permeability was observed following the removal of the cytokine cocktail, demonstrating the capability of this platform to observe the transient shift in cell response with high resolution. Of particular importance is that the fiber photometry platform aligns well with offline effluent analysis, the current standard approach. The platform may more accurately align temporally observed outputs with accurate on-chip cellular responses. Collection of effluent from OOC typically requires hours due to the low volumetric flow rates used during culture. Standard analysis equipment, such as fluorescence plate readers, usually needs at least 50 μL for reliable reading from a standard 96-well plate.45,46 Inflammation of HUVECs on filter inserts To assess the inflammation response of HUVECs, we dosed TNF-α at 100 ng mL−1 on HUVEC monolayers grown on semi-permeable filter inserts. Significant barrier inflammation was observed by lucifer yellow permeability assay at 1 day (p = 0.0002) and 2 days (p < 0.0001) post-dose (Fig. S5†). Morphological changes in monolayer structure were observed by immunocytochemistry, showing elongation of actin filaments in response to inflammation. Additionally, the expression of tight-junction protein ZO-1 is more diffuse at cell borders compared to controls (Fig. S6†). Inflammation of HUVECs on-chip To demonstrate the broad applicability of our novel sensing platform to cell agnostic barrier function assays, we extended our investigation to include sensed barrier formation and inflammation of HUVECs cultured on our OOC. Our established gut-on-a-chip was adapted to culture HUVECs under continuous perfusion, highlighting the versatility of our layer-by-layer design. HUVECs have been used to mimic the endothelial barrier of human vasculature, and chronic vascular inflammation is a risk factor for hypertension, kidney disease, and atherosclerosis.47–50 Continuous monitoring of endothelial barrier function may help elucidate the transient effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines with higher granularity compared to standard trans-endothelial electrical resistance or permeability assays. Our platform tracked HUVEC monolayer formation and the time-dependent increase in barrier permeability in response to dosed TNF-α (Fig. 6A and B). Significant increases in sensed fluorescence compared to control samples were observed at 24 hours (p = 0.0357) and 48 hours (p = 0.0072) after dosing TNF-α on-chip. Similar to results obtained for the inflammation and recovery of Caco-2 on a chip, a comparison of sensed and sampled fluorescence shows identical response time to the addition of TNF-α (Fig. 6A). Immunofluorescence shows more diffuse expression of ZO-1 in HUVEC monolayers exposed to TNF-α for 48 hours compared to controls cultured for the same period, qualitatively supporting the disruption of barrier function due to induced inflammation (Fig. S7†). Fig. 6.

Open in a new tabThe photometry platform is adaptable for barrier function from multiple barrier-forming cell types. Importantly, our sensing platform required no change or optimization when transitioning from Caco-2 cells to HUVECs. This technology is easily integrated into our laser cut and assemble method for fabricating OOCs. This method keeps the manufacturing costs of culture platforms down and allows fiber stubs to be swapped from one experimental OOC to another without signal degradation. Sensing is based on detected luminescence and is not dependent on the particular cell type used; however, some troubleshooting may be required for OOC systems with particularly high flow rates or fluidic channels susceptible to occlusion with cell debris or other obstructions. Multiplexed sensing Barrier function is commonly characterized with TEER. Investigating passive vs. active transport or permeability-specific analytes in vitro cannot be accomplished with TEER. To demonstrate the versatility of our novel on-chip sensing platform in combating these challenges, we investigated the diffusion rate of fluorescently labelled dextrans across our OOC's semi-permeable membrane. The platform was adapted to enable dual-sensing, simultaneously collecting fluorescence from two distinct fluorophores present on-chip. Specifically, the chosen dextrans differed either in size (10 kDa vs. 70 kDa) or in net charge (neutral vs. anionic) to detect the dependency of tracer structure on observed transport. Our sensing platform enabled direct estimation of dextran apparent permeability in our OOC system. When tracked simultaneously, the 10 kDa (2.45 × 10−4 cm s−1) dextran had a higher apparent permeability compared to the 70 kDa dextran (1.62 × 10−4 cm s−1). As expected, the larger 70 kDa dextran diffused slower through the on-chip membrane, as shown by a gradual increase in sensed fluorescence (Fig. 7A). The net charge had no discernible effect on apparent permeability across neutral (2.08 × 10−4 cm s−1) and anionic (2.09 × 10−4 cm s−1) dextrans of equivalent size (Fig. 7B). Fig. 7. Optical sensing allows real-time multiplexing of fluorescently tagged analyte. A) Size-dependent diffusion rate of fluorescently tagged dextran sensed simultaneously. A 10 kDa dextran (tagged with Alexa Fluor 647) diffused more rapidly through the semi-permeable membrane compared to the 70 kDa dextran (tagged with fluorescein). B) Charge-dependent diffusion rate of dextran of similar size (neutral: Texas Red; anionic: fluorescein). Open in a new tabAlthough no differences were observed in our empty OOC system, the presence of binding sites with high ionic affinity in other biological systems may influence diffusion kinetics, revealing system-specific transport differences.51 By utilizing our platform for multiplexed sensing, observed differences in diffusive rate kinetics may help elucidate process-specific transport in biological systems, especially where both modes of transport are of interest. For example, transport across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) has been extensively studied on-chip, where both passive and active transport influence observed barrier transport.52–56 Genetic and chemical tools may be further leveraged to monitor the transport of specific analytes, data required to yield insight into pharmacokinetics in vitro. Additionally, the hardware and utility applied to enable simultaneous, dual-channel sensing may be readily adapted to achieve multi-channel luminescence sensing, expanding on the technology demonstrated in this work. Our dual-color sensing platform recorded apical and basal channel fluorescence from a single camera, offering dual-channel detection of two distinct fluorophores. While this approach utilized only two of the seven available fibers, the described platform may be expanded to collect independent spatiotemporal luminescence from up to seven total channels in OOCs, offering multi-channel capabilities beyond the demonstrated dual-channel recordings. Our fiber optic-based platform has the potential to sense and record any luminescence, provided the appropriate excitation and emission waveguides are implemented.57 We have demonstrated our platform's versatility by sensing from four different fluorophores (lucifer yellow, fluorescein, Texas Red, Alexa Fluor 647) in this manuscript. By simple exchange of LEDs, filters, and optical waveguides, we may adapt the platform to sense across the visible range, allowing for direct use with commercial probes. As a result, our sensing capabilities may be broadened to applications beyond barrier function, such as fluorescent protein expression or calcium sensing. Further, our system has the potential for high-throughput, real-time readouts of luminescence intensity for temporal tracking of cellular responses from multiple OOCs simultaneously. We have demonstrated our platform's capability for multi-OOC sensing by monitoring barrier functions in three OOCs simultaneously. Although our platform may be capable of sensing from up to seven OOCs simultaneously using commercially available fiber bundles, our throughput is inherently limited to three OOCs by syringe-driven physiological flow in our gut-on-a-chip. Bulky syringe pumps and the routing of fluidic tubing introduce significant barriers to OOC throughput, limiting available incubator space while introducing multiple rate limiting steps in culture setup. With ongoing advancement in fluidic handling for OOCs, we hope to significantly expand our sensing throughput to approach levels comparable to effluent sampling. A recent demonstration of similar technology in freely moving animals has shown that high-density recording of transient calcium flux in up to 48 individual brain areas is possible.58 Applying custom high-density fiber arrays to organ chips may allow for whole-chip spatial sensing and high throughput data collection across numerous OOCs simultaneously, offering high-content, spatiotemporal optical sensing to address current throughput limitations.",

Copyright notice ID: 11969330 PMID: 40181784 Abstract Over the past 30 years, organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have emerged as a robust alternative to address the technological challenges associated with current in vitro and in vivo options. Although OOCs offer improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity, broad adoption has remained limited. Most approaches to characterize on-chip structure and function require human intervention, limiting device translation and feasibility. Here, we introduce a new fiber optic-based sensing platform that enables automated, temporal luminescence sensing on-chip, validated for real-time readout of epithelial and endothelial barrier function under cytokine-induced inflammation. Our platform, capable of at least 1 μM resolution, tracked paracellular transport in situ for 9 days of culture under perfusion on-chip. These results offer an alternative sensing approach for continuous, non-invasive luminescence monitoring in OOCs. Our engineered fiber optic-based sensing platform was validated for spatiotemporal monitoring of barrier function in our in-house fabricated gut-on-a-chip, offering a non-invasive approach for characterizing the on-chip microenvironment.Introduction Organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have significantly advanced human disease modelling and drug development, offering improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity by integrating physical and chemical stimuli matched to physiologically relevant conditions.1–4 Although significant innovations have been made toward recreating organ-specific physiology on chip, the methods available to study the structure and function of the cell microenvironment are still limited.5–7 Established analysis approaches, such as fluorescence microscopy, often rely on laborious offline workflows that yield acute or terminal time-point data.8,9 These complex techniques require substantial manual perturbations, frequently adding environmental and user-based variability to inherently inconsistent biological samples. As the OOC field continues to evolve, there is a unique opportunity to engineer improved in situ characterization methods into organ-chip devices. It is essential to develop novel approaches that address current limitations and enable real-time readout of relevant physiological parameters in OOCs to improve the reliability and robustness of these systems. Electrochemical and optical methods are the most common approaches for integrated sensing on-chip. Numerous demonstrations of electrochemical sensors have been integrated into OOC, showing high sensitivity and specificity for a range of analytes, including pH, oxygen concentration, glucose, and lactate.10–14 Electrochemical methods have also been adapted for structural characterization of the microenvironment, tracking transient changes in barrier permeability, cell health, and differentiation state throughout culture on-chip.15–17 Van der Helm et al. integrated plated electrodes on-chip for impedance spectroscopy measurements of Caco-2 monolayers differentiated on-chip.17 Although electrochemical methods offer continuous, real-time data from the on-chip microenvironment, these approaches suffer from high costs resulting from complicated fabrication workflows for sensor integration and relatively rapid sensor fouling or site saturation.5,18 Broad adoption of OOCs will require inexpensive consumable culture ware paired with reusable sensor technologies. Optical interrogation methods have been the standard for characterizing the on-chip microenvironment, enabling direct visualization of cell structure and quantitative outputs, including viability and protein expression.7,19,20 Optical and fluorescence microscopy techniques offer non-invasive and non-destructive characterization of cellular dynamics on-chip, including oxygen consumption, calcium signalling, and barrier permeability.21–24 In a multi-organ chip system, Novak et al. tracked the distribution of inulin-FITC tracer dye with an automated fluorescence microscopy platform, demonstrating repeatable concentration profiles for each of eight organ models over 3 weeks.21 However, most experimental procedures are limited to single OOC setups and require human intervention for timepoint data collection. These requirements limit utility in drug development where high throughput is needed or requires expensive, high-content imaging systems.5,9 Recent work has attempted to address this issue by automating organ-chip handling or miniaturizing optical components for direct integration.18,21 Integrated sensing approaches are an attractive option for non-invasive characterization, combining the benefit of direct optical sensing with continuous, automated outputs.18,25,26 Despite the advantages of fully integrated optical sensing, most approaches are not amenable to on-chip integration due to the bulky equipment required for directing beam paths or the complexity of the organ-chip system used. We sought to develop a fiber optic-based sensing system to enable fully integrated on-chip sensing, isolating optical components from the sample of interest by transmitting signals across fiber optic cables. Optical cables allowing for bidirectional light transmission are coupled to high-powered LEDs, simultaneously delivering excitation and recording emitted wavelengths to a CMOS camera or photomultiplier tube. The system collects signal as an aggregate sum of luminescence from the excited area, significantly increasing the signal-to-noise ratio but sacrificing single-cell resolution. Our technology presents the unique opportunity to integrate optical fibers on-chip for in situ characterization of the cellular microenvironment using luminescent probes. We are the first to translate this technology to OOCs for in situ optical sensing. While other attempts have been made to enable real-time, fiber-optic-based fluorescence sensing in an organ chip, these approaches are limited to readout of oxygen concentration and pH only, using commercial systems with limited spectral range.25,26 To our knowledge, our fiber-based system is the first to enable real-time, spatiotemporal sensing across the visible luminescence spectrum in OOCs. Physiological barriers, for example, the intestinal epithelium and vascular endothelium, selectively regulate the flux of water, ions, and nutrients while preventing the passage of bacteria and pathogens.15,27 Disruption of barrier function in vivo leads to uninhibited, non-selective transport across the barrier and is associated with the pathophysiology of human diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease.28 In OOC systems, barrier function is commonly assessed using trans-epithelial/endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values.29–31 TEER is traditionally measured using an applied alternating current across a monolayer to determine the total ohmic resistance. Although TEER is a convenient method for characterizing barrier function on-chip, the current density applied across the barrier is dependent on electrode spatial configuration. Unequal distribution of current density across the barrier can lead to an over or underestimation of the actual TEER value. Further, with OOC platforms varying in size, shape, and orientation, it is difficult to translate measured values across systems without significant computational effort.17 Here, we report a novel optical sensing platform for automated, non-invasive sensing of barrier function in OOCs under baseline and perturbed conditions. Specifically, we validated our photometry-based platform by monitoring epithelial and endothelial cell responses to induced inflammation on-chip. This is the first report on applying photometry-based technology to OOC, offering a novel approach to study the on-chip environment in real-time, expanding on the current capabilities of optical microscopy and end-point analyses.Experimental Chip fabrication Organ chips were assembled layer-by-layer using our established laser-cut-and-assembly method, adding fiber optic insertion channels for non-invasive fluorescence sensing.32,33 Each layer's design was created using computer-aided design software (SolidWorks, Adobe Illustrator) and converted to vector format. Layers were laser cut (Epilog Zing) from transparent, cast polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, McMaster-Carr, 8560K211, and 8560K171) sheets. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) semi-permeable membranes (It4Ip, ipCellCulture 2000M12/620M103) with 1 μm pore size were used to support the cell population and separate the apical and basal compartments. As previously described, layers were bonded with pressure-sensitive, double-sided adhesive tape (3M, 966). The chips were built on top of a no. 1 glass coverslip base layer (Fisher, 12-541-020), which sealed the bottom of the chip. Organ chips were assembled by hand, heat pressed at 55 °C for 90 seconds under moderate pressure and then placed in a vacuum oven for at least 5 days at 50 °C to allow the adhesive tape to off-gas and fully cure. Binder clips were used to apply additional pressure to the assembled chips while baking.Fiber photometry optical setup Our fiber photometry platform consists of two CMOS cameras capable of imaging the proximal end of fiber optic patch cables, with filters and dichroic mirrors to isolate excitation and emission wavelengths. The optical setup was engineered for simultaneous dual-channel recording, enabling continuous monitoring of apical and basal organ-chip compartments by independent, duplicate optical components to isolate channel recordings. The platform was assembled as follows, according to the direction of the beam path. A high-powered 430 nm LED (M430F1, Thorlabs), controlled by a 4-channel LED driver (DC4104, Thorlabs), was coupled to a collimator (F671SMA-405, Thorlabs) by a fiber optic patch cable (M59L01, Thorlabs). The collimator directed excitation light through an excitation filter (430/10 nm, 65-682, Edmund) held in a quick-release filter holder (SM1-QP, Thorlabs). A dichroic mirror (510 nm, 86-332, Edmund) directed excitation light through a 20x magnification objective (1-U2B225, Olympus) and onto the bundled optical fiber (BF74LS01, Thorlabs) held in a 5-axis translator (KC1T, Thorlabs). Excitation light is propagated through the bundled fiber to individual low-autofluorescence patch cables (MAF3L1, Thorlabs) connected by SMA to an FC/PC adapter (ADAFCSMA1, Thorlabs). The distal ends of the fiber patch cables were connected to a quick-disconnect ferrule (ADAF2, Thorlabs) and a fiber stub (CFMC54L10, Thorlabs), which was inserted into the chip for optical recording. Emitted fluorescence was recovered to the dichroic mirror, passing through an emission filter (520/10 nm, FB520-10, Thorlabs) held in a quick-release filter holder (SM1-QP, Thorlabs). Filtered emission fluorescence was focused onto a CMOS camera (BFS-PGE-31S4M-C, FLIR) by an achromatic doublet (AC254-035-A-ML, Thorlabs) and recorded for analysis. Additional instructions and considerations for platform assembly and use are described in ESI† Methods.Automated image capture and recording A 4-channel LED driver and CMOS cameras were linked to an Arduino microcontroller (Mega 2560 Rev3, Arduino) to automate image capture and recording. Square-wave TTL triggers were sent at 10 minute intervals to excite lucifer yellow on-chip and subsequently record emitted fluorescence. Each LED pulse supplied 0.2–0.3 mW cm−2 with a 200 ms pulse width. A 1 second pause between apical and basal recordings was implemented to prevent spectral overlap across channels. Although this pause time may be reduced to 100 ms for improved temporal alignment across channels (system limitations), we found that a 1 second pause sufficiently captures the dynamics of barrier transport. Captured images were automatically saved to pre-named folders on an external laptop via camera software (SpinView, FLIR).Optical readout analysis Fiber photometry recordings were analyzed, in real-time, using custom Python code to determine relative fluorescence intensity values, following each acquired image. The Python package scikit-image (https://scikit-image.org; version 0.21.0 and 0.22.0) was used to automatically detect and draw circular regions of interest (ROI) around each illuminated fiber end and measure mean pixel intensity within each ROI. Mean intensities were used to calculate dF/F for each fiber, with timestamped values exported to a CSV file for additional analysis. Additional analysis methods are described in detail in ESI† Methods.Caco-2 culture Caco-2 epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in phenol-free DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1% GlutaMAX™ Supplement (Gibco), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco), and 10 mM HEPES (Gibco). Cells were used between passages 40–57 for all experiments.Caco-2 chip seeding In preparation for cell seeding, chips were UV sterilized (300 mJ cm−2) for 10 minutes on top and bottom sides (Spectrolinker XL-1000, Spectronics Corporation, Westbury NY), followed by treatment with oxygen plasma for 90 seconds (Harrick Plasma PDC-001). UV-sterilized fluidic connections and tubing were connected to the chips. The apical channel was treated with 200 μL of 1 : 10 v/v solution of Matrigel™ (Corning) in ice-cold DPBS (Gibco) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour. Caco-2 cells were harvested from flasks via treatment with 0.25% trypsin–EDTA (Gibco) for 15 minutes at 37 °C. After cell detachment, the cell solution was diluted with an equal volume of cell culture media and centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and the pelleted cells were resuspended at 5 × 106 cells per mL in fresh cell culture media. The apical and basal fluidic inlets were clamped, and 200 μL of the cell suspension was infused into the apical channel using a sterile 1 mL pipette tip. The apical fluidic outlet was clamped, and the chips were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 hours to allow cell attachment. After attachment, all clamps were removed, and pre-heated cell culture medium was perfused through apical and basal channels at 3 μL min−1via a syringe pump (NE-1600, New Era Pump Systems, Inc).Dosing the pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail on-chip Caco-2 were cultured on organ-chips for 7 days until a confluent, differentiated monolayer formed. Perfusion was briefly paused to exchange growth media for media containing the pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail. Lucifer yellow (Invitrogen, L453) at a concentration of 100 μM in appropriate cell culture media was perfused at 1 μL min−1 through the apical channel only. Proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α (PeproTech), IFN-γ (PeproTech), and IL-1β (PeproTech) were added to the basal channel culture media and perfused at 1 μL min−1. Cytokine concentrations for TNF-α and IFN-γ were 200 ng mL−1 and 100 ng mL−1 for IL-1β. The cytokine cocktail was perfused for 4 days to disrupt barrier function without causing irreversible damage. After 4 days, for barrier function recovery, the apical media contained 100 μM of lucifer yellow, and basal media was growth media only.Culture of Caco-2 monolayers on semi-permeable filter inserts PET filter inserts in a 24-well plate were coated with 200 μL of a 10% Matrigel™ solution in DPBS and incubated at 37 °C for at least 1 hour. Caco-2 cells were harvested from a sub-confluent T-75 flask and processed as described for organ-chip seeding. The resulting cell suspension was diluted to a final concentration of 4 × 105 cells per mL. The Matrigel™ solution was removed, and 200 μL of cell suspension (80 000 cells) was seeded on each filter insert. Culture media was exchanged after 6 hours to remove non-adhered cells and prevent cell stacking. Media was exchanged every 2–3 days until day 21. Inflammation was induced on day 21 by dosing with our pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail. Briefly, media was removed, and monolayers were washed with DPBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. After washing, monolayers were dosed basally with media containing 200 ng mL−1 TNF-α, 200 ng mL−1 IFN-γ, and 100 ng mL−1 IL-1β.HUVEC culture Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in Vascular Cell Basal Medium (ATCC) supplemented with Endothelial Cell Growth Kit-BBE (ATCC) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were used between passages 4–7 for chip experiments and passage 4 for filter insert experiments.HUVEC chip seeding Chips were prepared for seeding as previously described. HUVECs were harvested from flasks via treatment with 0.25% trypsin–EDTA (Gibco) for 10 minutes at 37 °C. After cell detachment, the cell solution was diluted with an equal volume of cell culture media and centrifuged at room temperature at 200g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and the pelleted cells were resuspended at 7.5 × 106 cells per mL in fresh cell culture media. Cells were seeded on-chip as previously described and perfused through apical and basal channels at 3 μL min−1.Dosing the TNF-α on-chip HUVECs were cultured on organ-chips under 3 μL min−1 perfusion for 3 days until a confluent monolayer formed. Briefly, apical media was exchanged for 100 μM lucifer yellow media, and basal media was dosed with 100 ng mL−1 of TNF-α. Chips were perfused at 1 μL min−1 for 2 days to disrupt barrier function.Culture of HUVEC monolayers on semi-permeable filter inserts PET filter inserts in a 24-well plate were coated with 200 μL of a 10% Matrigel™ solution in DPBS and incubated at 37 °C for at least 1 hour. HUVECs were harvested from a sub-confluent T-75 flask and processed as described for organ-chip seeding. The resulting cell suspension was diluted to a final concentration of 4 × 105 cells per mL. The Matrigel™ solution was removed, and 200 μL of cell suspension (80 000 cells) was seeded on each filter insert. Media was exchanged every 2 days until a confluent monolayer was observed. Inflammation was induced by dosing with 100 ng mL−1 TNF-α.Real-time barrier function monitoring Fluorescence intensity in apical and basal channels was recorded via fiber photometry to track barrier function. Fluorescence intensity measurements were collected automatically from inserted optical fibers every 10 minutes during induced inflammation and recovery on-chip.Lucifer yellow permeability assays For on-chip experiments, apical and basal effluent were collected every 24 hours and stored at 4 °C until analysis. All effluent samples were analyzed together to avoid temperature-dependent effects on measured fluorescence. Samples were analyzed via fluorescence plate reader (Synergy HT, Bio-Tek) with 485/20 excitation 528/20 emission filter set and gain set to 50. Monolayers on permeable filter supports were washed with DPBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. After washing, pre-heated phenol-free media was added to the basal compartment, and a solution of 100 μM lucifer yellow in media was added to the apical compartment (pH = 7.2). Monolayers were incubated at 37 °C for 3 hours. As previously described, samples from apical and basal compartments were collected and analyzed by a plate reader.Immunocytochemistry Samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. After fixing, the solution was removed, and cells were washed three times with DPBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 15 minutes, followed by another three DPBS washes. Samples were blocked with filtered 4% goat serum solution in DPBS overnight at 4 °C. Zonula occludens-1 (1 : 100, ZO-1, Invitrogen, 40-2200) primary antibodies in 4% goat serum were added to the samples, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and carefully rinsed with DPBS three times. Phalloidin Alexa Fluor 647 (1 : 1000, Invitrogen A22287) and DAPI (1 : 1000, Invitrogen, D1306) were diluted in 4% goat serum, incubated at room temperature for 2 hours, and carefully rinsed three times with DPBS. Samples were imaged immediately or stored in parafilm and aluminum foil at 4 °C. For chips, monolayers were stained and imaged for tight junction protein expression to assess barrier function qualitatively. All steps were conducted via a syringe pump at a flow rate of 5 μL min−1 to minimize damage to the monolayer. Samples were fixed by perfusing 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS for 30 minutes and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 20 minutes at room temperature. Monolayers were blocked under perfusion with 4% goat serum in DPBS for 2 hours at room temperature. Chip tubing ends were clipped, all chips were covered with foil, and incubated in the fridge overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, an antibody cocktail containing 1 : 200 ZO-1 conjugated antibody (Invitrogen, MA3-39100-A647), 1 : 1000 phalloidin (Invitrogen, A12379), and 1 : 1000 DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) in 4% goat serum was perfused at 5 μL min−1 for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by static incubation overnight at 4 °C. Monolayers were washed with DPBS for at least 6 hours at 5 μL min−1 and imaged immediately.Dual-color diffusion assay The fiber photometry platform was engineered to enable sensing of fluorescein (494 ex./521 em.) and either Texas Red (595 ex./615 em.) or Alexa Fluor 647 (650 ex./668 em.) labelled dextrans. Optical components were exchanged for appropriate wavelength range delivery and recovery to enable dual-color sampling. A 470 nm LED (M470F4, Thorlabs) and 483/31 nm excitation filter (67-028, Edmund) delivered excitation light for fluorescein dextran. Either a 595 nm LED (M595F2, Thorlabs) and 590/10 nm excitation filter (FBH590-10, Thorlabs) or 625 nm LED (M625F2, Thorlabs) and 630/10 nm excitation filter (FBH630-10, Thorlabs) was used for Texas Red or Alexa Fluor 647 labelled dextrans, respectively. Dichroic mirrors (510 nm (86-332, Edmund) and either 552 nm (86-334, Edmund) or 660 nm (67-084, Edmund)) directed excitation light on-chip and emitted light to CMOS cameras. Dextrans were dosed apically onto untreated chips at a concentration of 25 μM using two combinations, varying size or charge. For varied charges, Texas Red (40 kDa, neutral, Invitrogen D1829) and fluorescein (40 kDa, anionic, Invitrogen D1844) were dosed. For varied sizes, Alexa Fluor 647 (10 kDa, anionic, Invitrogen D22914) and fluorescein (70 kDa, anionic, Invitrogen D1823) were dosed. The fluorescence intensity of each dextran was tracked by fiber photometry on-chip under static conditions for 48 hours. The apparent permeability (Papp) of each fluorescent dextran was calculated using the following equationwhere dFbasal/dt is the rate of sensed fluorescence intensity change of the dextran in the basal channel, Vbasal is the volume of the basal channel (0.3 cm3), A is the membrane surface area (0.1341 cm2), and Fapical is the sensed fluorescence intensity of the dextran in the apical channel. Only the linear portion of the fluorescence intensity change was used for calculation such that Fapical is much greater than Fbasal.34Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise specified. All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software). One-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons was applied, and p-values of <0.05 were considered significant. All chip experiments were reproduced at least three times across independent groups to confirm reliability.Results and discussion Fiber photometry platform and optical fiber integration Our previously established layer-by-layer gut-on-a-chip32,33 was adapted to add fiber optic insertion channels to the upper and lower fluidic layers (Fig. 1A and C). The 500 μm wide fiber channels were positioned at the outlets to detect the exit concentration of fluorophore from each fluidic layer. A 500 μm thick PMMA wall separates the fluidic channel from the fiber insertion channel for complete separation of the optical components from the culture volume. With the terminal end of the fiber optic cable in proximity (∼500 μm or less) to the culture volume of interest, excitation and emission luminescence may be sensed with a high signal-to-noise ratio, offering non-invasive delivery and collection of light with 92% visible light transmission.35 10 mm long fiber optic stubs were inserted into the channels for non-invasive sensing, delivering excitation light to the culture volume and receiving emitted light (Fig. 1B). Preliminary design testing found that orienting the fiber stubs perpendicular to the side of the culture flow channels was most effective when sensing both apical and basal fluorescence at the outlet of the chip without channel crosstalk. Other design configurations, such as positioning the excitation from the top-down, offered reasonable sensitivity despite increased measurement variability by attenuation through the cell monolayer and membrane. This optical sensing approach may be easily adapted to additional organ-chip designs and orientations, enabling optical sensing across numerous OOC models. Most OOC are fabricated from optically transparent materials for microscopy, commonly poly-dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) or thermoplastics, allowing direct adaptation to a photometry-based sensing approach. This approach enables the sensing components (ferrule coupled fiber stubs) to be reused over long lifespans and rapidly swapped between OOCs compared to embedded electrodes. Fig. 1. Optical sensing organ-on-a-chip system. A) A fabricated chip with apical and basal fiber optical ports indicated. B) An assembled chip with optical fibers inserted for noninvasive real-time sensing. Both apical and basal fibers are illuminated with 470 nm light to exhibit the excitation volume. C) An exploded view of each layer used to fabricate platform. Optical fibers may be inserted in the apical and/or basal flow layer without disrupting cell culture or flow, as shown. Open in a new tabSensing setup and automation The fiber photometry platform utilized for barrier sensing was assembled as a mirror image, enabling independent sensing of upper and lower fluidic compartments of each OOC (Fig. 2A and S1†)—bundled fiber optic cables allowed for sensing from up to 7 OOC simultaneously. Three OOCs were cultured concurrently (1 control, 2 experimental). For multiplexed sensing, excitation light for both λs was directed through the same fiber with a 3 second delay between channels to avoid spectral overlap. Collected emission was directed to independent cameras for λ-specific signal analysis (Fig. S2†). For both barrier sensing and multiplexed sensing, fiber optic cables were routed into an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for non-invasive sensing from up to three OOCs simultaneously (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2. Fiber photometry system for optical sensing on-chip. A) Components consist of high-powered LEDs, optical filters, fiber optic cables, and CMOS cameras that simultaneously deliver excitation light and record emission from fluorophores on-chip. B) A laptop and Arduino microcontroller are used to automate LED power and image capturing. Fiber optic cables transmit excitation and emission wavelengths with minimal loss from within the incubator to the external hardware. Open in a new tabTo ensure cross-chip consistency, the intensity of light emitted from each fiber end was measured at 400 mA LED power, which was used for all sensing experiments. The measured intensity was 0.25 ± 0.04 mW cm−2, with a maximum difference of 20.3% from the mean intensity (Fig. S3†). Limiting intensity variation across individual fibers improves sensitivity and consistency when measuring across multiple OOCs since the excitation power is directly proportional to the collected emission signal. Maintaining output intensities within a reasonable range narrows the emission signal, allowing for optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio when first implementing the platform. In our experience, large variations in excitation power across fibers (>50%) may saturate some channels before acceptable signal-to-noise is achieved for other channels. The platform was connected to an Arduino microcontroller to automate and synchronize image capture with fluorophore excitation. Our custom Arduino program sent 200 ms LED excitation pulses on-chip every 10 minutes to capture time-dependent diffusion data with minimal photobleaching. Timestamped images were automatically captured by a TTL trigger sent to the CMOS camera during excitation. Microcontroller-aligned LED and camera triggers enabled completely hands-free data collection of on-chip data throughout complete experimental timelines, requiring only initial setup and baseline image collection by hand. Our compact setup, consisting of the photometry optical equipment, an Arduino microcontroller, and a laptop, enables sensing on-chip in a small footprint essential for research labs with limited free space. A preliminary calibration curve was constructed by dosing known concentrations of lucifer yellow in DPBS on blank chips to determine the relative sensing range of our optical sensing platform. Emitted fluorescence was recorded by our optical sensing platform and normalized to blanks chips containing only DPBS. The resulting calibration curve shows a robust linear relationship between fluorophore concentration and measured fluorescence, capable of detection to as low as 1 μM on-chip (R2 = 0.998, Fig. S4†).Inflammation-induced disruption and recovery of Caco-2 cells on-chip To establish the resolution of our system to measure small changes in barrier integrity, we aim to mimic an inflamed gut. A pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail was added to Caco-2 monolayers, first on semi-permeable inserts, to increase permeability without fully disrupting the cell population. Caco-2 monolayers grown for at least 21 days on filter inserts were subjected to TNF-α (200 ng mL−1), IFN-γ (200 ng mL−1), and IL-1β (100 ng mL−1) for 4 days. Cytokines were removed, and monolayers were allowed to recover for up to 5 days. Compared to control monolayers on the same day of culture, monolayers exposed to the cytokine cocktail showed a significant (p = 0.0003) increase in permeability on day 4 of inflammation and significant (p = 0.0231) recovery of barrier function 2 days after cytokine removal (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4. A) Graphical description of effluent- and photometry-based barrier function assays. Effluent was collected from chips daily and fluorescence was measured via plate reader. Fiber photometry readings were collected automatically by our novel platform. B) Relative permeability of Caco-2 monolayers exposed to the cytokine cocktail (TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-1b) on day 0.

C) Comparison of barrier function characterization methods. dF/F (black) sensed by photometry shows a similar time course increase in barrier permeability compared to effluent (orange). One-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). n = 3, m = 3 control, 5 experimental replicates. Circles, squares, and triangles represent biological replicates 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Dotted vertical line represents the removal of the cytokine cocktail. D) Basal sensed fluorescence difference from control sensed by fiber photometry during Caco-2 monolayer inflammation and recovery. Sensed fluorescence intensity trends increasing compared to controls as exposure time to the cytokine cocktail increases. Data is shown as mean (black) ± standard deviation (grey). n = 3, m = 3 control, 5 experimental replicates. Dotted vertical line represents the removal of the cytokine cocktail. Open in a new tabThe described cytokine concentrations were used for inflammation of Caco-2 on-chip. Caco-2 cells were cultured on-chip for 7 days under continuous perfusion at 3 μL min−1 (0.076 dyne per cm2), mimicking physiological shear stress in the intestine.3,36 Our previous work has demonstrated epithelial maturity on-chip at this timepoint. We then dosed a pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail composed of TNF-α (200 ng mL−1), IFN-γ (200 ng mL−1), and IL-1β (100 ng mL−1) to induce inflammation on-chip (Fig. 3A and B). Fig. 3. Experimental overview for real-time barrier function sensing on-chip. A) Fiber optic cables detect fluorescence from apical and basolateral chambers in our gut-on-a-chip. Inflammation was induced in mature epithelial monolayers (left), resulting in barrier disruption and increased fluorophore transport (right). B) Timeline for cytokine-induced inflammation in our gut-on-a-chip. Cells formed a mature monolayer after 7 days of culture under continuous flow. On day 0, the paracellular permeability marker lucifer yellow was added to apical media and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-1b) were dosed via basal media. Barrier function was tracked by our sensing platform. Open in a new tabBarrier function was continuously assessed by our novel sensing platform and by daily collection of chip effluent (Fig. 4A). Comparison of sensed and sampled fluorescence shows good agreement, with similar response time to the addition and removal of the pro-inflammatory cocktail (Fig. 4C). The mean increase in barrier permeability across experimental replicates (n = 5) is relatively consistent despite some distinct peaks caused by effluent sampling and syringe exchange on day 4 (Fig. 4D). Our sensing platform is robust and capable of automated data collection over at least 9 days with consistent outputs from independent experimental replicates. Further, data collected using our platform enabled real-time readout of barrier function over the 9 day experimental time course. Real-time, optical readout of barrier function in OOC has not previously been reported. Compared to daily effluent sampling, we significantly increased the temporal resolution of cellular responses to induced inflammation on-chip, observing a continuous, gradual increase in barrier permeability earlier than daily effluent sampling (Fig. 4C). Further, a change in permeability is observed as early as shortly after the day 2 sampling timepoint (Fig. 4D), while no discernible change in permeability presents till day 4 for effluent sampling. Application of this approach to time-dependent assays on shorter experimental timescales may significantly improve temporal resolution, increase sensitivity, and data quality. Effluent and sensed barrier function corroborate that the Caco-2 monolayer underwent inflammation in response to the dosed cytokine cocktail. Still, the level and kinetics of recovery did not match that observed in filter inserts; however, prolonged barrier integrity disruption measured on-chip, effluent, and optical measures matched. Qualitatively, immunofluorescence imaging suggests that the barrier had recovered partially, indicated by qualitative reorganization of ZO-1 expression to cell–cell junctions (Fig. 5). Fig. 5. Representative immunocytochemistry results on-chip from control (left column), 96 hour cytokine exposure (center column), and 120 hour recovery (right column) groups. Comparison of tight-junction expression (ZO-1) shows more diffuse expression in inflamed monolayers compared to control and recovery. Images taken at 40× magnification, maximum intensity projection of 10-slice z-stack. Open in a new tabQuantitative analysis of collected effluent and sensed data show that barrier permeability was significantly increased compared to controls from day 6 until the experiment ended. The absence of native stem cells and immune cells in this gut-on-a-chip model may prevent complete recovery from induced inflammation.37–39 Our lab has previously demonstrated that Caco-2 cells cultured on our gut-on-a-chip differentiate in 5 days, exhibiting polarization and brush borders comparable to mature epithelium.30,32 Continuous perfusion provides physiological shear stress, continuous nutrient supply, and waste removal, whereas static cultures receive fresh media intermittently. Mechanical shear stress may influence proliferation and the restructuring of tight-junctions, resulting in the differences in recovery observed across filter insert and on-chip systems (Fig. 4B and C).40–42 After cytokine-induced inflammation of differentiated Caco-2 monolayers, tight junctions must undergo replication and reorganization to return to a healthy, functional morphology.40,41 Caco-2 cultured on filter inserts may high a higher propensity to proliferate and restructure more rapidly compared to on-chip due to the lack of fluidic shear stress, as reflected in our experiments. Although previous work indicates that tight-junction reorganization and recovery on-chip is possible in less than 24 hours, these studies induced acute barrier dysfunction by the chelating agent EGTA.43,44 To our knowledge, we are the first to report on the recovery response of Caco-2 on-chip following chronically induced barrier inflammation. Additionally, excess cytokines may have remained present during the recovery phase due to the diffusion-dependent clearing of cytokines from the on-chip microenvironment. Unlike typical culture approaches that allow washing the monolayer, the cytokines could not be thoroughly flushed from the system due to the risk of destroying the fragile, inflamed monolayer under higher shear stress. The differences between filter inserts and on-chip experiments further support this hypothesis: monolayers cultured on filter inserts showed significant recovery only 48 hours after cytokine removal. In comparison, the OOC monolayers showed no significant decrease in permeability after 96 hours (Fig. 4B and C). A shift from increasing barrier permeability to constant, elevated permeability was observed following the removal of the cytokine cocktail, demonstrating the capability of this platform to observe the transient shift in cell response with high resolution. Of particular importance is that the fiber photometry platform aligns well with offline effluent analysis, the current standard approach. The platform may more accurately align temporally observed outputs with accurate on-chip cellular responses. Collection of effluent from OOC typically requires hours due to the low volumetric flow rates used during culture. Standard analysis equipment, such as fluorescence plate readers, usually needs at least 50 μL for reliable reading from a standard 96-well plate.45,46Inflammation of HUVECs on filter inserts To assess the inflammation response of HUVECs, we dosed TNF-α at 100 ng mL−1 on HUVEC monolayers grown on semi-permeable filter inserts. Significant barrier inflammation was observed by lucifer yellow permeability assay at 1 day (p = 0.0002) and 2 days (p < 0.0001) post-dose (Fig. S5†). Morphological changes in monolayer structure were observed by immunocytochemistry, showing elongation of actin filaments in response to inflammation. Additionally, the expression of tight-junction protein ZO-1 is more diffuse at cell borders compared to controls (Fig. S6†).Inflammation of HUVECs on-chip To demonstrate the broad applicability of our novel sensing platform to cell agnostic barrier function assays, we extended our investigation to include sensed barrier formation and inflammation of HUVECs cultured on our OOC. Our established gut-on-a-chip was adapted to culture HUVECs under continuous perfusion, highlighting the versatility of our layer-by-layer design. HUVECs have been used to mimic the endothelial barrier of human vasculature, and chronic vascular inflammation is a risk factor for hypertension, kidney disease, and atherosclerosis.47–50 Continuous monitoring of endothelial barrier function may help elucidate the transient effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines with higher granularity compared to standard trans-endothelial electrical resistance or permeability assays. Our platform tracked HUVEC monolayer formation and the time-dependent increase in barrier permeability in response to dosed TNF-α (Fig. 6A and B). Significant increases in sensed fluorescence compared to control samples were observed at 24 hours (p = 0.0357) and 48 hours (p = 0.0072) after dosing TNF-α on-chip. Similar to results obtained for the inflammation and recovery of Caco-2 on a chip, a comparison of sensed and sampled fluorescence shows identical response time to the addition of TNF-α (Fig. 6A). Immunofluorescence shows more diffuse expression of ZO-1 in HUVEC monolayers exposed to TNF-α for 48 hours compared to controls cultured for the same period, qualitatively supporting the disruption of barrier function due to induced inflammation (Fig. S7†). Fig. 6. A) Comparison of barrier function characterization methods for HUVECs on-chip. dF/F (black) sensed by photometry shows a similar time course increase in barrier permeability compared to effluent (orange). One-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). n = 3, m = 3 control, 6 experimental replicates. Circles, squares, and triangles represent biological replicates 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Dotted vertical line represents the addition of TNF-a. B) Basal sensed fluorescence difference from control sensed by fiber photometry during HUVEC monolayer formation and inflammation. Sensed fluorescence intensity increases compared to controls as exposure time to the cytokine cocktail increases. Data is shown as mean (black) ± standard deviation (grey). n = 3, m = 3 control, 6 experimental replicates. Dotted vertical line represents the addition of TNF-a. Open in a new tabThe photometry platform is adaptable for barrier function from multiple barrier-forming cell types. Importantly, our sensing platform required no change or optimization when transitioning from Caco-2 cells to HUVECs. This technology is easily integrated into our laser cut and assemble method for fabricating OOCs. This method keeps the manufacturing costs of culture platforms down and allows fiber stubs to be swapped from one experimental OOC to another without signal degradation. Sensing is based on detected luminescence and is not dependent on the particular cell type used; however, some troubleshooting may be required for OOC systems with particularly high flow rates or fluidic channels susceptible to occlusion with cell debris or other obstructions.Multiplexed sensing Barrier function is commonly characterized with TEER. Investigating passive vs. active transport or permeability-specific analytes in vitro cannot be accomplished with TEER. To demonstrate the versatility of our novel on-chip sensing platform in combating these challenges, we investigated the diffusion rate of fluorescently labelled dextrans across our OOC's semi-permeable membrane. The platform was adapted to enable dual-sensing, simultaneously collecting fluorescence from two distinct fluorophores present on-chip. Specifically, the chosen dextrans differed either in size (10 kDa vs. 70 kDa) or in net charge (neutral vs. anionic) to detect the dependency of tracer structure on observed transport. Our sensing platform enabled direct estimation of dextran apparent permeability in our OOC system. When tracked simultaneously, the 10 kDa (2.45 × 10−4 cm s−1) dextran had a higher apparent permeability compared to the 70 kDa dextran (1.62 × 10−4 cm s−1). As expected, the larger 70 kDa dextran diffused slower through the on-chip membrane, as shown by a gradual increase in sensed fluorescence (Fig. 7A). The net charge had no discernible effect on apparent permeability across neutral (2.08 × 10−4 cm s−1) and anionic (2.09 × 10−4 cm s−1) dextrans of equivalent size (Fig. 7B). Fig. 7. Optical sensing allows real-time multiplexing of fluorescently tagged analyte. A) Size-dependent diffusion rate of fluorescently tagged dextran sensed simultaneously. A 10 kDa dextran (tagged with Alexa Fluor 647) diffused more rapidly through the semi-permeable membrane compared to the 70 kDa dextran (tagged with fluorescein). B) Charge-dependent diffusion rate of dextran of similar size (neutral: Texas Red; anionic: fluorescein). Open in a new tabAlthough no differences were observed in our empty OOC system, the presence of binding sites with high ionic affinity in other biological systems may influence diffusion kinetics, revealing system-specific transport differences.51 By utilizing our platform for multiplexed sensing, observed differences in diffusive rate kinetics may help elucidate process-specific transport in biological systems, especially where both modes of transport are of interest. For example, transport across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) has been extensively studied on-chip, where both passive and active transport influence observed barrier transport.52–56 Genetic and chemical tools may be further leveraged to monitor the transport of specific analytes, data required to yield insight into pharmacokinetics in vitro. Additionally, the hardware and utility applied to enable simultaneous, dual-channel sensing may be readily adapted to achieve multi-channel luminescence sensing, expanding on the technology demonstrated in this work. Our dual-color sensing platform recorded apical and basal channel fluorescence from a single camera, offering dual-channel detection of two distinct fluorophores. While this approach utilized only two of the seven available fibers, the described platform may be expanded to collect independent spatiotemporal luminescence from up to seven total channels in OOCs, offering multi-channel capabilities beyond the demonstrated dual-channel recordings. Our fiber optic-based platform has the potential to sense and record any luminescence, provided the appropriate excitation and emission waveguides are implemented.57 We have demonstrated our platform's versatility by sensing from four different fluorophores (lucifer yellow, fluorescein, Texas Red, Alexa Fluor 647) in this manuscript. By simple exchange of LEDs, filters, and optical waveguides, we may adapt the platform to sense across the visible range, allowing for direct use with commercial probes. As a result, our sensing capabilities may be broadened to applications beyond barrier function, such as fluorescent protein expression or calcium sensing. Further, our system has the potential for high-throughput, real-time readouts of luminescence intensity for temporal tracking of cellular responses from multiple OOCs simultaneously. We have demonstrated our platform's capability for multi-OOC sensing by monitoring barrier functions in three OOCs simultaneously. Although our platform may be capable of sensing from up to seven OOCs simultaneously using commercially available fiber bundles, our throughput is inherently limited to three OOCs by syringe-driven physiological flow in our gut-on-a-chip. Bulky syringe pumps and the routing of fluidic tubing introduce significant barriers to OOC throughput, limiting available incubator space while introducing multiple rate limiting steps in culture setup. With ongoing advancement in fluidic handling for OOCs, we hope to significantly expand our sensing throughput to approach levels comparable to effluent sampling. A recent demonstration of similar technology in freely moving animals has shown that high-density recording of transient calcium flux in up to 48 individual brain areas is possible.58 Applying custom high-density fiber arrays to organ chips may allow for whole-chip spatial sensing and high throughput data collection across numerous OOCs simultaneously, offering high-content, spatiotemporal optical sensing to address current throughput limitations.Conclusions In summary, we have developed a novel optical sensing platform for automated, non-invasive barrier function measurements in OOCs. The platform has been validated for sensing small changes in barrier integrity in real-time, improving on the current standard of effluent sampling and analysis or TEER measurements. Our platform does not interact directly with the on-chip sample, offering advantages over integrated electrochemical sensors susceptible to electrode fouling or site saturation. We have demonstrated that, by exchanging optical filters and dichroic mirrors, luminescence across the visible wavelength range may be measured. Further, the system may be utilized for multiplexed sensing of multiple fluorophores simultaneously, broadening applications to size- and process-specific transport across barriers.Author contributions B.

    "abstract": "Abstract Exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Understanding the effects of the spaceflight environment on biological systems is an important area of research because of health concerns associated with increased human spaceflight activities in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and in future deep space exploration of the Moon and Mars. Our research focuses on the skeletal bone loss observed in mammalian rodent models in response to microgravity and space radiation, including their mechanisms of action, and their relative contributions to altered skeletal homeostasis. Rigorously investigating the effects of spaceflight on bone, however, has proven to be complex because of highly variable space experiments conditions, plus technical, logistic and other limitations on the ability to control and replicate those experiments. As a result, reports of spaceflight effects on bone vary; findings range from increases in mandibular bone volume to both significant and nonsignificant changes in tibial trabeculae and various cortical sites [1–8]. Similarly, meta-analyses of spaceflight bone loss across species show variable site-specificity and magnitudes [9,10] of bone structural parameters. The NASA Rodent Research validation mission (RR-1) introduced the NASA RH as an ISS National Lab facility for rodent studies in order to standardize discrepancies between spaceflight studies (Fig 1A). Importantly for experiment design, animals can also be euthanized and dissected on orbit, avoiding potential concerns about hypergravity exposure during spacecraft reentry in live animal return experiments. The RR-1 experiment included ground-based controls in the RH, baseline controls to account for effects of aging over the 37-day study, and vivarium controls to reference results to standard vivarium cage mouse housing [11,12] (Fig 1B). In our investigation of RR-1 bone tissue samples, we focused on the hindlimb and the spine to compare sites of the skeleton predominantly loaded by weight-bearing and muscle activity, respectively (Fig 1C). The experiment used mice during the late stages of skeletal maturation, that occur between 16 and 21 weeks of age, prior to onset of femoral growth plate closure and secondary endochondral ossification (SEO) [13]. Fig 1. (A) Image of the RH used in the ground control and spaceflight conditions (credit Dominic Hart, NASA). Open in a new tab (B) Each experimental condition of the NASA RR-1 study showing the biologically relevant independent variables examined. Adapted from Choi, et al. [11]. (C) Representative studied sites of μCT analysis with type of bone and the thickness of the selected VOI. A specific focus of our study is the femur because of its major weight-bearing role in the mouse. Cancellous regions in the proximal and distal femur provide structural scaffolding during cortical bone growth [14], and are normally atrophied with aging [15,16] post skeletal maturation. Similarly to aging, spaceflight induces unrecoverable resorption of trabeculae in rodents and humans [17,18] and increases fracture risk in long bones [19]. As a primary weight-bearing center in the mouse skeleton [20], the femoral head is an important study site to understand the effects of disuse on skeletal health. Opposite the femoral head, the distal epiphysis of the femur is another site of SEO and direct loading [21] by the torsional stress of keeping the hip joint and ankle aligned [22,23]. Unlike cancellous bone, the comparably low surface area to volume ratio of cortical bone makes it more resilient to bone resorption during spaceflight [18]. Finally, the femoral neck is the thinnest cortical region in this bone, and as such, it is the site of most hip fractures in elderly patients [24], making it another important analysis site for our study. For contrast to the predominantly weight-bearing femur, we also analyzed the L2 vertebra in RR-1 mice. In bipedal humans, the spine is primarily loaded by the weight of the upper body. In quadrupedal rodents, however, the L2 vertebra is thought to be loaded mainly through the articulation of the thorax and abdomen via the lumbar and abdominal muscles, rather than serving a weight-bearing role. Thus, we hypothesize bone loss in the rodent model is a site-specific phenomenon associated with mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton, rather than other systemic factors. Using standard methodology for the quantification of bone parameters with histology and microcomputed tomography (μCT) [25], within the regions of interest described in Fig 1C, we conducted global and same-animal paired comparisons of bone parameters in the femur and L2 vertebrae sites to rigorously test the idea that bone loss in LEO is specific to mechanically unloaded skeletal sites and not due to systemic effects.",
    "methods": "Methods Animals The bone tissues used in this study were from mice in the NASA RR-1 flight experiment. 12 week old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were matched by weight and assigned to groups (n = 10/group), housed in standard vivarium cages, and acclimated for 4 weeks to control experimental conditions, as previously described [11], prior to launch at 16 weeks of age. Food and water were available ad libitum and further husbandry details have been published [11]. All animal procedures were approved and carried out by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Secondary dissection tissues used in this study were collected by astronauts on orbit and dissected by the RR-1 Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) team on the ground. Tissues were awarded by the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) for study to EACA (femur) and JSA (vertebrae). Reduced specimen numbers in certain sample groups, such as the femoral head, was due to sample damage that occurred during biospecimen sharing dissections. Rodent habitat The RR-1 study was the first to utilize and validate NASA’s RH modules for spaceflight experiments. These were modified from previous model of AEM to support long-term housing aboard the ISS after the end of the STS program. Mice were socially housed at n = 5 per side of the RH. RHs included new long-duration exhaust filters, refillable water compartments, and were equipped with four cameras each to assess rodent health and behavior during the experiments. Details of habitat upgrades are found in Table 1 of Choi, S., et al., 2020 [11]. Spaceflight Mice were launched into space at 16 weeks of age and flight conditions were replicated in controls except for transport to orbit on SpaceX Dragon at twice the normal density using a RH Transporter unit on ascent. An Animal Access Unit was used on the ISS to transfer mice from the Transporter to the RH and for accessing the mice during the experiment duration. A Mouse Transfer Box transported mice from the Transporter or the RH to the Microgravity Science Glovebox for injections and on orbit euthanasia when mice were 21 weeks of age [11]. Radiation dosimetry on ISS over the duration of the experiment was measured to be about 7.4 mGy, although shielding by the RH locker and EXPRESS rack likely reduced the radiation dose compared to the rest of the ISS [11]. Experimental protocol RR-1 spaceflight experiments were performed as previously described in detail by Choi, et al [11]. In brief, RR-1 used 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice exposed to microgravity for 37 days on-orbit (FL) in RHs (4 days in flight transit and 33 days on the ISS). A group of ground control mice was housed in standard mouse vivarium cages (VIV) while another group was housed in RHs (GC) (Fig 1A) inside ISS Environmental Simulator chambers (ISSES). The ground control mice were offset by 4 days relative to spaceflight to account for transit time. An additional group of basal control mice was euthanized 1 day after launch (BL). All mice carcasses were kept at -80oC until FL mice samples were returned to Earth (105 days). Upon thawing and dissection, femurs and a section of the lumbar vertebral column were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for μCT, and for paraffin embedding plus sectioning, followed by histological staining. Safranin-O staining The staining of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) using Safranin-O was performed on 6 μm deparaffinized sections of the femoral head and distal epiphysis to obtain a representative sampling of pre-SEO and SEO samples. Cartilage was stained using 0.1% Safranin-O. Bone tissue was visualized using polarized light and differential interference contrast (DIC). In each animal, a sagittal section of each region was selected for comparisons between experimental conditions and the femoral head plus distal epiphysis, was imaged on Zeiss Axioskop microscope in DIC mode with a 20X 0.5 NA Plan NeoFluar lens (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, New York, USA) for sGAG content evaluation. Microcomputed tomography The right femur from each sample was scanned using Bruker SkyScan 1272 μCT (Kontich, Belgium). Scans were performed at 60 kV of x-ray energy with a 0.25 mm thick aluminum filter. Images were taken every 0.5 degrees and averaged over 3 frames. Scans using the SkyScan 1272 were conducted at 0.6 μm for the femoral head, 3 μm for the femur, and 4 μm for vertebrae. Tomographies were reconstructed with Bruker SkyScan NRecon software and the Instarecon reconstruction server (Instarecon Inc., Urbana Illinois) using a ring artifact correction of 10, and a beam hardening correction of 40%. Reconstruction and segmentation Reconstructed μCT images of the femur were uploaded to DataViewer software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium), and reoriented in two parts; one where the z-axis was concentrically aligned with the midshaft and distal epiphysis, and one where the z-axis was concentrically aligned with the femoral neck. Vertebrae were oriented so both lateral pedicles were parallel. Appropriate orientation was confirmed and visualized in 3D using CTVox software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium). Fixed dimension volumes of interest (VOIs) were selected, and bone regions were segmented using CTAn software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium) for each of the five selected sites. For the L2 vertebrae, a cancellous VOI of 0.6 mm was isolated, extending from the caudal growth plate to its connection with the lateral pedicles. The femoral head was analyzed with a cancellous VOI of 0.4 mm, defined by the tissue between the end of the metaphyseal growth plate and start of the cortical femoral neck. In the femoral neck, a cortical VOI of 0.14 mm segmented the tissue connecting the end of the femoral head region to the femoral shaft. The femoral midshaft was analyzed with a cortical VOI of 0.48 mm, determined by averaging the z-position of the proximal and distal ends of the femur. Lastly, the distal femoral epiphysis had a cancellous VOI of 1.12 mm, extending from the epiphyseal growth plate towards the midshaft (Fig 1C). Digital image analysis The BATch MANager program within CTAn, was used to create task lists for 2D and 3D bone analyses and executed for each of the VOIs cancellous or cortical region [25], and output measurements were obtained for comparison between experimental groups. Cancellous bone in the proximal and distal epiphyses was evaluated using percent bone volume (BV/TV, %), number of trabeculae per mm (Tb.N, 1/mm), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm), trabecular pattern factor (Tb.Pf, 1/mm), and connectivity density (Conn.D, 1/mm3). Cortical bone was evaluated using percent bone area (BA/TA, %), average cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), endosteal perimeter (E.Pm, mm), and periosteal perimeter (P.Pm, mm). Secondary endochondral ossification was visually evaluated in cross-sectional views of the femoral head to determining if the epiphyseal growth plate and mineralized distal cartilage had been converted to the fully ossified cancellous tissue morphology characteristic of SEO. Statistical analysis We used Prism v. 10.1.0 (GraphPad Inc., Boston, Massachusetts), to conduct one-way ANOVA tests between each experimental group for each measurement to identify variability between their means, with α = 0.05 set for the threshold for significance. Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference was implemented for post-hoc analysis, and these p-values were used for significance brackets. To evaluate the magnitude of effect between housing type and spaceflight conditions, the changes of BV/TV in VIV and FL groups relative to GC was calculated. To compare percent change between groups, a one-sample t-test was implemented with a hypothetical mean of zero. A paired t-test was performed between the vertebrae, femoral head, and distal epiphysis within the same sample, which evaluated within-subject variation of bone volume at weight-bearing versus non-weight-bearing site pairs.",
    "results": "Results Bone loss in the weight bearing femoral head and distal epiphysis cancellous bone regions depends on housing type and spaceflight in microgravity In the femoral head, BV/TV was significantly decreased in spaceflight compared to all control environments (BL, −25%; VIV, −18%; GC, −27%) (Fig 2A). FL bones also had significantly fewer trabeculae than basal mice (−15%), which was unchanged in the two control habitats (Fig 2B). FL bones showed thinner trabeculae (BL, −16%; GC, −17%) (Fig 2C), an increase in separation (BL, +26%; GC, +22%) (Fig 2D), and a higher pattern factor (BL, +163%; GC, +755%) (Fig 2E) compared to BL and GC bones. Conn.D remained unchanged (Fig 2F). Interestingly, the VIV group had nonsignificant trends of similar magnitude in their trabecular metrics indicating loss as observed in the spaceflight group. VIV bones had more space between trabeculae than the BL control, which was not reflected in GC indicating a housing effect (+18%) (Fig 2D). Overall, the femoral head shows significant bone atrophy expressed in multiple bone parameters after 37 days in space (Fig 2G). Fig 2. Bone loss in the mouse femoral head is associated with weightlessness in microgravity. Open in a new tab Characterization metrics of cancellous bone in the femoral head show that (A) BV/TV is decreased in FL. Bones from FL mice have significantly lower (B) Tb.N and of those trabeculae, spaceflight reduces (C) Tb.Th. Both age and spaceflight increase (D) Tb.Sp, whereas only FL has an increase in (E) Tb.Pf. (F) Conn.D is not significantly affected; however, VIV and FL have similarly reduced Conn.D. VIV bones experience another similar increase in magnitude of Tb.Pf, which was not statistically significant. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, * : p < 0.033, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002, ****: p < 0.0001). (G) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show evident decreased cancellous bone in FL.At the distal epiphysis, BV/TV was significantly decreased in VIV and FL bones from GC levels (VIV, −41%; FL, −55%) (Fig 3A). Similarly to the femoral head, the distal epiphysis in spaceflight samples showed fewer trabeculae as compared to BL (−39%) and GC bones (−42%), which was not observed in VIV bones (Fig 3B). Though trabecular thickness was unchanged (Fig 3C), separation of trabeculae was increased in FL compared to BL and GC (BL, +16%; GC, +14%) (Fig 3D). VIV had significantly higher trabecular separation (+12%) compared to basal mice, a result which was also observed in the femoral head. Spaceflight significantly increased Tb.Pf from GC mice (+27%) (Fig 3E). The FL group had significantly lower connectivity density than BL (−50%) and GC (−52%), which was not seen in the VIV (Fig 3F). This indicates that GC housing in the RH may rescue aging-related bone loss in the distal epiphysis of vivarium cage housed mice. In all trabecular metrics, the VIV group experienced loss trends similar to those in FL bones. Collectively, the data suggest, relative to the RH, the vivarium cage housing allows aging-related bone loss to progress in the cancellous regions of weight bearing bones in the form of fewer trabeculae and fewer plate-like structures (Fig 3G). Fig 3. The loss of bone in the femoral distal epiphysis is affected by housing type and weightlessness conditions in microgravity. Open in a new tab Cancellous bone measurements in the distal epiphysis exhibit a housing-related dependency on (A) BV/TV as well as an effect from spaceflight. (B) Tb.N is decreased in FL following the same patterns as BV/TV. Interestingly, (C) Tb.Th. is not affected by age, cage type, or spaceflight, however age and spaceflight significantly increase (D) Tb.Sp (E) Tb.Pf is only effected in FL. (F) Conn.D is decreased in FL. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, * : p < 0.033, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002). (G) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show visibly decreased presence of bone in VIV and FL. Long bone cortical tissues undergo degenerative changes in space The femoral neck experiences compression and bending forces near its connection to the femoral shaft. We found that BA/TA is significantly lower in FL compared to VIV, although not by a large magnitude (−6%, p < 0.05) (Fig 4A). Ct.Th is not significantly changed between groups, though a trend exists such that the VIV group has thicker cortical bone (Fig 4B). E.Pm is significantly higher in FL than in all other groups (BL, +50%; VIV, +34%; GC, +43%) (Fig 4C), where P.Pm remains unchanged (Fig 4D). These results indicate that cancellous structures in the femoral neck endocortical region may be eroded with spaceflight (Fig 4E). Fig 4. Femoral neck marrow cavity is enlarged in spaceflight but not significantly changed with age and habitat conditions. Open in a new tab Cortical bone characterization metrics in the femoral neck indicate FL has less (A) BA/TA than VIV. Nonsignificant trends in the data show an increase in (B) Ct.Th in VIV that is opposite in FL. (C) E.Pm is significantly increased in VIV, GC, and FL from BL, though (D) P.Pm experiences no changes. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, * : p < 0.033, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002). (E) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show similar presence of bone in BL and GC, while VIV and FL demonstrate erosion in the endosteal surface.With the process of aging to skeletal maturity, cancellous scaffolding is reduced, and the cortical shell of bones becomes thicker providing more withstanding force against loading [26]. This effect is seen between the BL and VIV groups, where BA/TA (+7%, p < 0.005) and Ct.Th (+7%, p < 0.01) increase with time (Fig 5A-B). Spaceflight significantly inhibits this by reducing BA/TA (−6%, p < 0.005) and Ct.Th (−8%, p < 0.005) from VIV levels (Fig 5A-B). Unlike in the femoral neck, there were no effects seen in the E.Pm (Fig 5C), which may be due to the midshaft region lacking cancellous bone while the femoral neck has residual cancellous structures extending from the femoral head. P.Pm remained unchanged in all conditions (Fig 5D). These results indicate that the femoral midshaft experiences significant cortical thinning, which may be attributed to spaceflight (Fig 5E). Fig 5. In the femoral midshaft, spaceflight abrogates increases in bone parameters BA/TA and Ct.Th in controls. Open in a new tab Cortical bone characterization metrics in the femoral midshaft indicate the effect of age increasing (A) BA/TA and (B) Ct.Th, which is undone in FL. (C) E.Pm and (D) P.Pm are unchanged between groups. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002). (E) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show similar presence of bone in BL and GC, while FL demonstrates erosion in the endosteal surface. Load-bearing vertebrae do not show μCT parameter changes related to age, housing, or spaceflight in microgravity Within the L2 vertebrae, our analysis did not detect statistically significant changes to μCT parameters between groups, though there are several nonsignificant trends for small magnitude losses in space. Specifically, parameters like BV/TV, Tb.N, and Tb.Th in FL appear slightly decreased (Fig 6A-F), but the variance in measurements prevents any conclusions from being drawn. Thus, the L2 vertebrae is not significantly affected by housing type or spaceflight, suggesting it is not measurably responsive to weight-bearing load changes. Fig 6. Vertebral cancellous tissueμCT parameters are not significantly affected by aging from 16 to 21 weeks, housing type, or microgravity. Open in a new tab Cancellous bone characterization metrics in the L2 vertebrae demonstrate no differences between groups in (A) BV/TV, (B) Tb.N, (C) Tb.Th, (D) Tb.Sp, (E) Tb.Pf, or (F) Conn.D. Nonsignificant trends implicate an effect of spaceflight reducing BV/TV, increasing DA, and reducing Tb.N. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant). (G) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show a slight decrease in bone parameters from FL mice, which are not deemed significant by statistical testing. Decreased mechanical loading during spaceflight in microgravity only causes significant bone loss in weight-bearing skeletal sites To assess if weight-bearing bone sites in the femur would experience more loss than non-weight-bearing spine, the percent change of the BV/TV of GC samples to the average value of FL was compared using a one-sample t-test with a hypothetical mean of zero (Fig 7A). The vertebrae had an average change of −7% ± 10% (p = ns), while the femoral head lost 27% ± 9% (p < 0.0001) and the distal epiphysis lost 55% ± 10% (p < 0.0001). A paired t-test between the vertebrae and either the femoral head (Fig 7B) or distal epiphysis (Fig 7C) shows significant differences of bone loss within individual samples (p < 0.005). Throughout these results, the vivarium group in standard cages also showed bone loss effects but smaller in magnitude than spaceflight. Using a one-sample t-test and a paired t-test, these trends were quantified. The vertebrae experienced an increase in BV/TV by 8% ± 8% (p < 0.05), where the femoral head and distal epiphysis demonstrate significant bone loss of 12% ± 6% (p < 0.01) and 41% ± 14% (p < 0.0001), respectively (Fig 7D). Within samples, these effects were confirmed as all samples experienced similar degrees of loss from non-weight bearing vertebrae to the weight-bearing femoral head (p < 0.005) (Fig 7E) and distal epiphysis (p < 0.0001) (Fig 7F). Thus, the non-weight-bearing spine bone site did not experience significant change in spaceflight while weight-bearing femoral regions underwent extensive bone loss, indicating weightlessness may be the primary effector of bone loss during spaceflight in LEO. Fig 7. Bone loss in microgravity versus 1g controls in the RH is specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites. Open in a new tab Using one-sample and paired t-tests, findings revealed (A) vertebrae showed no significant change, while the (B) femoral head and (C) distal epiphysis experienced significant bone loss in spaceflight, suggesting that microgravity unloading, but not other systemic factors, caused bone loss in LEO. (D-F) The vivarium cage housing, known to provide reduced topological enrichment, also elicited bone losses of smaller magnitude than spaceflight, but only in weight-bearing bone sites. Secondary endochondral ossification is accelerated during spaceflight in microgravity Following μCT imaging, we characterized the appearance of SEO, a marker of adult skeletal maturation, at both epiphyses in the femur (Fig 8A). As SEO of the femoral head occurs between 21 and 23 weeks of age, bones from the VIV group had twice the occurrences of ossification within the femoral head than BL, and the data shows the GC habitat somewhat rescued this effect. However, FL mice had a 50% ossification rate, 20% above the VIV group, suggesting an increased prevalence of premature skeletal maturation. Interestingly, in the distal epiphysis, GC and FL, and VIV and BL groups had the same occurrences of ossification (Fig 8B), potentially related to distal epiphyseal fusion regulation predominantly by hormonal factors versus mechanotransduction [13]. Fig 8. Spaceflight in microgravity accelerates secondary endochondral ossification of the proximal epiphysis in the femur. Open in a new tab FL bones had 50% of their cohort ossified in the (A) femoral head, over twice as many as in GC cohort. Differences in ossification at BL (16 weeks) and the other groups (21 weeks) in the (B) distal epiphysis appear independent of aging. (C) μCT volumetric reconstructions of the femoral head from a representative sample from each group show increased cavitation in the mineralized cartilage of the VIV and FL groups.Safranin-O staining of the femoral head revealed that the region consisted entirely of hypertrophic cartilage region and a well-defined growth plate between articular cartilage and mineralized bone in baseline bones (Fig 9A). Within the VIV group, sGAG content was depleted in the articular cartilage due to early signs of ossification relative to other groups, although the growth plate remained active (Fig 9B). GC bones had this effect rescued with a maintenance of hypertrophic chondrocytes and cartilage (Fig 9C). The FL sample shows that complete ossification is associated with full sGAG and chondrocyte activity loss within the femoral head (Fig 9D). However, the distal epiphysis provides different results based on the state of SEO. From BL (Fig 9E) to VIV, both classified as pre-SEO with μCT, there is a decrease in sGAG content likely due to aging (Fig 9F). The GC sample, classified as SEO, has slightly less sGAG content than VIV, especially in the trabecular region at the top of the image (Fig 9G), however it does present a continuous area of mineralized tissue along the growth plate. This plate is marked by light pink staining, which is preserved between two continuous areas of bone in the FL example at late-stage SEO (Fig 9H). These observations suggest the process of SEO in the distal femur may induce more chondrocyte activity to rearrange cancellous structure and close the growth plate, however additional studies will be required to elucidate these questions. Fig 9. Spaceflight in microgravity reduces sGAG content in the femoral head and distal epiphysis. Open in a new tab Representative histology of Safranin-O staining on femoral heads, with the (A) BL as the control, show a decrease of proteoglycan content in (B) VIV, a loss of the distinct tidemark in (C) GC, and complete deficit in an ossified sample from (D) FL. The distal epiphyses show ossification-dependent changes to the growth plate. During pre-ossification at 21 weeks (F, VIV), proteoglycan content decreases and is upregulated during ossification (GC, FL) to finalize remodeling into the dual-walled gap characteristic of distal epiphysis secondary ossification.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Spaceflight in LEO is well-documented to cause significant bone loss and is often compared to physiologically aged, osteopenic phenotypes [27,28]. NASA’s early systematic studies of spaceflight effects on rodent bone physiology were conducted in short duration Space Shuttle Space Transportation System (STS) studies lasting ten to fourteen days using the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) in a mid-deck locker. More recent results, with longer durations greater than thirty days on the International Space Station (ISS) use the Rodent Habitat hardware (RH), on the EXPRESS rack and broadly show relatively smaller degenerative bone losses possibly due to rodent acclimation to microgravity [11,19,29]. These effects are thought to be caused throughout bone tissue as a result of cellular proliferation and differentiation homeostasis imbalance between bone forming osteoblasts and bone degrading osteoclasts [30] with osteocytic osteolysis [31] and apoptosis [32] also playing a role. Exceptions to this general assertion have been reported for calvariae [33,34] and mandibles [1,35] with increases or maintenance of bone volume during spaceflight, potentially due to greater mechanical stimulation from elevated intracranial pressure due to microgravity cephalic fluid shift. However, these studies mostly measured acute, short-term spaceflight effects during NASA’s Space Shuttle (STS) era and have limitations as a model for longer-term exposures more relevant to future spaceflight missions. Other experimental variables in spaceflight include species and strain, animal age at launch, experiment duration, ambient temperature, humidity, CO2 concentrations, sample collection methods during or post-flight, and habitat type used. Like the STS AEM, the ISS RH provides a wire-mesh interior, allowing group-housed mice behavior and activities with associated mechanical demands similar to ground-based enriched habitats. Such activities include grappling across the cage to access food, climbing the 3D internal structure, and uniquely for space flown mice, to run in a loop along the perimeter of the habitat [12]. However, these activities only emerged after acclimation to space on days 11 and 12 in the RR-1 mice [12], where other STS experiments would have already concluded or been within a few days of ending. A fundamental distinction between ground-based spaceflight simulations and low-Earth orbit is the type and dosage of radiation. Ground-based simulations often use low LET radiation, such as X-rays, at high acute doses of a few Gray (Gy) [36,37]. In contrast, spaceflight radiation is high linear energy transfer (LET), which has been shown to induce bone loss when acute doses of 1–2 Gy are administered [38]. However, on the ISS, the total high LET radiation dose over 37 days was only ~7.4 mGy, with an average daily dose of 207 µGy [11]. This acute dosage in ground simulations is equivalent to ~13 years of radiation exposure on the ISS delivered instantaneously. While space radiation is commonly considered a potential factor in mediating bone loss in space, the radiation measured over the duration of the RR-1 experiment in LEO is generally not considered sufficient to cause bone loss [11,39]. Therefore, conclusions drawn from ground-based simulations are not directly comparable to spaceflight conditions. Although there are other potential factors that can contribute to bone loss in space such as reactive oxygen species, calcium secretion, and hormonal imbalances [40–43], all these factors are thought to be systemic in the organism and would be expected to cause bone loss across the entire skeletal system. Current literature does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that ROS production is site-specific within bone or bone marrow. Both microgravity and radiation are systemic factors, leading to the conclusion that ROS production affects the skeletal system uniformly. Because of this, we investigated the role of site-specific microgravity mechanical unloading in mediating bone loss, and we sought to test the hypothesis that the effects observed are primarily due to decreased weight-bearing in space and not to other systemic factors. To evaluate these ideas, we conducted μCT analysis on the femoral head, neck, midshaft, distal epiphysis, and L2 vertebrae, both from space flown mice and ground control animals housed in the topologically enriched RH as well as in standard vivarium cages. Through aging, rodents experience decreased bone volume fraction and trabecular number due to remodeling of the bone favoring periosteal cortical development [44–46]. In contrast, dynamic mechanical loading via exercise significantly increases healthy biomechanical properties of bone [47–49]. The femoral head is also a key site of skeletal development and maturation [50], where secondary SEO of the epiphysis, converts the growth plate and mineralized cartilage into cancellous mineralized tissue [51,52]. Concomitantly, the femoral midshaft experiences high bending torsional loads during normal ambulation [53], making disuse of these areas interesting to compare to other sites of the skeleton that are not weight bearing. In the femur shaft, capacity to hold loads is primarily imparted by cortical bone which typically reaches maximum thickness after twelve weeks of age[44] with significant thinning of the cortical wall not occurring until after eight months of age [54]. Fracture risk is also increased with age [55,56] as cortical bone becomes brittle [57–61] with structural disruption [62], likely due to dysfunctional remodeling [63,64] that may prevent micro-fracture repair [65]. STS missions show insignificant acute changes in cortical bone [17], but long-term loss is resistant to post-flight recovery [66]. Thus, vertebrae might reveal potential systemic bone degenerative effects not associated with microgravity weightlessness unloading as expected in the femur. Furthermore, the RH wire mesh interior is associated with increased mouse physical activity that occurs during long-duration spaceflight after initial acclimation [12] and may load this region of the spine, possibly attenuating minor weightlessness unloading effects. If space radiation in LEO or other systemic factors were the primary effectors of bone loss during spaceflight, we would expect systemic changes to the skeletal system. In that context, for ionizing radiation, we might also expect that thick, minerally dense regions of cortical bone could partially shield the bone marrow cavity and cancellous bone. This, however, does not appear to be the case, as our data shows the vertebral thin cortical and cancellous bone are unchanged in spaceflight (Fig 6), but the femoral neck, which has a substantial cortical region, experiences endosteal cancellous tissue loss (Fig 4). Therefore, our data strongly indicate that spaceflight-induced bone loss, is localized to two well-established direct weight-bearing skeletal locations in the femoral head and distal epiphyses. Moreover, the absence of significant bone loss in the L2 lumbar vertebra after 37 days of spaceflight is consistent with previous scans of L4 archived on NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSD-489, Alwood, et. al.). On Earth, the mechanical loading environment within the rodent spinal column is complex, including time- and position-varying loads of lateral bending, flexion/extension, and axial rotation dependent on the task being performed [67,68]. Despite the variation in the gravity vector with respect to the spine orientation, the vertebral body in both humans and quadrupeds experiences intermittent compressive forces and display unique fabric orientation of the cancellous tissue to the gravity vector while on Earth [68]. The response to spaceflight is less understood and likely varies by habitat topology, housing density, age, and experiment duration [10]. As active behaviors are abundantly observed in the RR-1 experiment, we infer the mice are mechanically loading their vertebral body by compression. In contrast, animals housed in the Russian Bion M-1 Habitat, with three mice per enclosure and smooth tubular walls resulting in low topological complexity [69], or in the Japanese Habitat Cage Unit, with single-housed mice and perforated walls that allowed grappling resulting in medium topological complexity [70,71], do not allow for the same running activity. To this effect, mice in the Russian Bion M-1 Habitat, significantly lost cancellous bone in the vertebral body compared to standard housing conditions [72]. Additionally, previous studies from our group using the hindlimb unloading model showed cancellous bone in the lumbar vertebra of male mice to be sensitive to musculoskeletal disuse, resulting in bone loss [73]. Taken together with the running activities and resulting intermittent compression on the ventral spine during RR-1 [12], we interpret the hindlimb unloading model to place less of a mechanical demand on the vertebral column compared to space flown and running mice. Furthermore, we used same-animal paired t-test analyses of bone parameters in weight-bearing bones such as the femur and load-bearing vertebrae to establish, with greater statistical power than one-sample t-test or ANOVA alone, that while the former are subject to loss in space, the latter are not. Additionally, bones from mice in the RH show healthier parameters in directly loaded regions than those from the vivarium (Fig 7). Systemic effects in the vertebrae, if present, should result in weaker cancellous structures and cortical bone would not have experienced the magnitudes of endocortical erosion, as shown in our data. We acknowledge that other potential systemic changes in bone tissue [74,75] may affect mechanical properties of bone, but the data strongly suggest that increased activity and microgravity have opposite effects on bone health parameters only at specific locations within weight bearing bone and no significant effects in bones primarily loaded by muscle tension, as long as the habitat used, such as RH, is permissive of physical activity in space. The totality of the data compellingly supports mechanical unloading as the primary effector of bone loss during spaceflight in LEO. This study also reports a previously unknown accelerated SEO effect of spaceflight on the femur. The role of SEO is to conclude the lengthening of long bones and serves as a developmental marker for skeletal maturation [51]. This process is likely mediated by transdifferentiation from chondroprogenitors to osteoprogenitors [76,77]. The results of our study suggest the femoral head initiates SEO with an increase in chondroprogenitor expression evidenced by an increase in sGAG content. Images of ossified bone demonstrate that this tidemark is propagated through the remaining articular cartilage until mineralized trabeculae constitute the entirety of the femoral head. In the distal epiphysis, the upregulation of chondrocyte activity is also demonstrated, however the plate does not dissolve to uniform mineralization, rather it maintains a layer of sGAGs between the mineralized bone in the marrow cavity and mineralized articular cartilage in the condyles. The percentage of SEO bones increased with age from BL to VIV groups. Interestingly, the effect of spaceflight on the progression of SEO was shown to accelerate complete ossification in the femoral head above the rate observed with aging. Concurrently, increased loading via activity experienced in the GC habitat mouse bones decreased the occurrence of ossification (Fig 8). Thus, bone mineralization homeostasis and SEO onset appears dependent on the magnitude of mechanical loading and unloading. Given that accelerated SEO is a significant physiological spaceflight effect, we checked additional archival μCT datasets. The 30-day Bion M-1 spaceflight experiment 19-week male mice also showed accelerated SEO, suggesting this is not an observation unique to the RR-1 study (unpublished results). This, however, was not found in other shorter flight experiments such as in the STS-131 Mouse Immunology spaceflight experiment with younger 14-week females (results in preparation). Common factors between RR-1 and Bion M-1 spaceflight experiments include a duration greater than 30 days both with mice ages nearing the onset of normal SEO which occurs at 21–23 weeks. Additional studies are needed to fully characterize the femoral head metaphyseal plate dynamics throughout the entire SEO process in the context of age, sex, and altered weight-bearing loading in microgravity. This study supports the hypothesis that bone loss effects we observe in the 37-day RR-1 spaceflight in LEO is site-specific and likely due to mechanical unloading and not space radiation or other systemic factors. It is unlikely that low levels of space radiation, as experienced in LEO, could have systemic effects capable of mediating bone loss, as there are no reports of simulated space radiation effects at this dose and dose rate in cortical bone or lumbar vertebrae. This study, however, does not rule out the likely possibility that longer exposures, or more energetic charged particle space radiation outside of LEO will have significant bone effects. Additionally, the novel observation of accelerated epiphyseal closure in the femoral head primary weight-bearing location in mice, suggests mechanical unloading may accelerate SEO of juvenile growing long bones into a prematurely mature state. The totality of the data strongly supports mechanical unloading due to weightlessness in microgravity, not radiation or other systemic factors, as the primary effector of spaceflight-related bone loss in LEO.",

Copyright notice ID: 11940681 PMID: 40138271 Abstract Exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.Introduction Understanding the effects of the spaceflight environment on biological systems is an important area of research because of health concerns associated with increased human spaceflight activities in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and in future deep space exploration of the Moon and Mars. Our research focuses on the skeletal bone loss observed in mammalian rodent models in response to microgravity and space radiation, including their mechanisms of action, and their relative contributions to altered skeletal homeostasis. Rigorously investigating the effects of spaceflight on bone, however, has proven to be complex because of highly variable space experiments conditions, plus technical, logistic and other limitations on the ability to control and replicate those experiments. As a result, reports of spaceflight effects on bone vary; findings range from increases in mandibular bone volume to both significant and nonsignificant changes in tibial trabeculae and various cortical sites [1–8]. Similarly, meta-analyses of spaceflight bone loss across species show variable site-specificity and magnitudes [9,10] of bone structural parameters. The NASA Rodent Research validation mission (RR-1) introduced the NASA RH as an ISS National Lab facility for rodent studies in order to standardize discrepancies between spaceflight studies (Fig 1A). Importantly for experiment design, animals can also be euthanized and dissected on orbit, avoiding potential concerns about hypergravity exposure during spacecraft reentry in live animal return experiments. The RR-1 experiment included ground-based controls in the RH, baseline controls to account for effects of aging over the 37-day study, and vivarium controls to reference results to standard vivarium cage mouse housing [11,12] (Fig 1B). In our investigation of RR-1 bone tissue samples, we focused on the hindlimb and the spine to compare sites of the skeleton predominantly loaded by weight-bearing and muscle activity, respectively (Fig 1C). The experiment used mice during the late stages of skeletal maturation, that occur between 16 and 21 weeks of age, prior to onset of femoral growth plate closure and secondary endochondral ossification (SEO) [13].

(C) Representative studied sites of μCT analysis with type of bone and the thickness of the selected VOI.A specific focus of our study is the femur because of its major weight-bearing role in the mouse. Cancellous regions in the proximal and distal femur provide structural scaffolding during cortical bone growth [14], and are normally atrophied with aging [15,16] post skeletal maturation. Similarly to aging, spaceflight induces unrecoverable resorption of trabeculae in rodents and humans [17,18] and increases fracture risk in long bones [19]. As a primary weight-bearing center in the mouse skeleton [20], the femoral head is an important study site to understand the effects of disuse on skeletal health. Opposite the femoral head, the distal epiphysis of the femur is another site of SEO and direct loading [21] by the torsional stress of keeping the hip joint and ankle aligned [22,23]. Unlike cancellous bone, the comparably low surface area to volume ratio of cortical bone makes it more resilient to bone resorption during spaceflight [18]. Finally, the femoral neck is the thinnest cortical region in this bone, and as such, it is the site of most hip fractures in elderly patients [24], making it another important analysis site for our study. For contrast to the predominantly weight-bearing femur, we also analyzed the L2 vertebra in RR-1 mice. In bipedal humans, the spine is primarily loaded by the weight of the upper body. In quadrupedal rodents, however, the L2 vertebra is thought to be loaded mainly through the articulation of the thorax and abdomen via the lumbar and abdominal muscles, rather than serving a weight-bearing role. Thus, we hypothesize bone loss in the rodent model is a site-specific phenomenon associated with mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton, rather than other systemic factors. Using standard methodology for the quantification of bone parameters with histology and microcomputed tomography (μCT) [25], within the regions of interest described in Fig 1C, we conducted global and same-animal paired comparisons of bone parameters in the femur and L2 vertebrae sites to rigorously test the idea that bone loss in LEO is specific to mechanically unloaded skeletal sites and not due to systemic effects.Methods Animals The bone tissues used in this study were from mice in the NASA RR-1 flight experiment. 12 week old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were matched by weight and assigned to groups (n = 10/group), housed in standard vivarium cages, and acclimated for 4 weeks to control experimental conditions, as previously described [11], prior to launch at 16 weeks of age. Food and water were available ad libitum and further husbandry details have been published [11]. All animal procedures were approved and carried out by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Secondary dissection tissues used in this study were collected by astronauts on orbit and dissected by the RR-1 Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) team on the ground. Tissues were awarded by the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) for study to EACA (femur) and JSA (vertebrae). Reduced specimen numbers in certain sample groups, such as the femoral head, was due to sample damage that occurred during biospecimen sharing dissections.Rodent habitat The RR-1 study was the first to utilize and validate NASA’s RH modules for spaceflight experiments. These were modified from previous model of AEM to support long-term housing aboard the ISS after the end of the STS program. Mice were socially housed at n = 5 per side of the RH. RHs included new long-duration exhaust filters, refillable water compartments, and were equipped with four cameras each to assess rodent health and behavior during the experiments. Details of habitat upgrades are found in Table 1 of Choi, S., et al., 2020 [11].Spaceflight Mice were launched into space at 16 weeks of age and flight conditions were replicated in controls except for transport to orbit on SpaceX Dragon at twice the normal density using a RH Transporter unit on ascent. An Animal Access Unit was used on the ISS to transfer mice from the Transporter to the RH and for accessing the mice during the experiment duration. A Mouse Transfer Box transported mice from the Transporter or the RH to the Microgravity Science Glovebox for injections and on orbit euthanasia when mice were 21 weeks of age [11]. Radiation dosimetry on ISS over the duration of the experiment was measured to be about 7.4 mGy, although shielding by the RH locker and EXPRESS rack likely reduced the radiation dose compared to the rest of the ISS [11].Experimental protocol RR-1 spaceflight experiments were performed as previously described in detail by Choi, et al [11]. In brief, RR-1 used 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice exposed to microgravity for 37 days on-orbit (FL) in RHs (4 days in flight transit and 33 days on the ISS). A group of ground control mice was housed in standard mouse vivarium cages (VIV) while another group was housed in RHs (GC) (Fig 1A) inside ISS Environmental Simulator chambers (ISSES). The ground control mice were offset by 4 days relative to spaceflight to account for transit time. An additional group of basal control mice was euthanized 1 day after launch (BL). All mice carcasses were kept at -80oC until FL mice samples were returned to Earth (105 days). Upon thawing and dissection, femurs and a section of the lumbar vertebral column were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for μCT, and for paraffin embedding plus sectioning, followed by histological staining.Safranin-O staining The staining of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) using Safranin-O was performed on 6 μm deparaffinized sections of the femoral head and distal epiphysis to obtain a representative sampling of pre-SEO and SEO samples. Cartilage was stained using 0.1% Safranin-O. Bone tissue was visualized using polarized light and differential interference contrast (DIC). In each animal, a sagittal section of each region was selected for comparisons between experimental conditions and the femoral head plus distal epiphysis, was imaged on Zeiss Axioskop microscope in DIC mode with a 20X 0.5 NA Plan NeoFluar lens (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, New York, USA) for sGAG content evaluation.Microcomputed tomography The right femur from each sample was scanned using Bruker SkyScan 1272 μCT (Kontich, Belgium). Scans were performed at 60 kV of x-ray energy with a 0.25 mm thick aluminum filter. Images were taken every 0.5 degrees and averaged over 3 frames. Scans using the SkyScan 1272 were conducted at 0.6 μm for the femoral head, 3 μm for the femur, and 4 μm for vertebrae. Tomographies were reconstructed with Bruker SkyScan NRecon software and the Instarecon reconstruction server (Instarecon Inc., Urbana Illinois) using a ring artifact correction of 10, and a beam hardening correction of 40%.Reconstruction and segmentation Reconstructed μCT images of the femur were uploaded to DataViewer software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium), and reoriented in two parts; one where the z-axis was concentrically aligned with the midshaft and distal epiphysis, and one where the z-axis was concentrically aligned with the femoral neck. Vertebrae were oriented so both lateral pedicles were parallel. Appropriate orientation was confirmed and visualized in 3D using CTVox software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium). Fixed dimension volumes of interest (VOIs) were selected, and bone regions were segmented using CTAn software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium) for each of the five selected sites. For the L2 vertebrae, a cancellous VOI of 0.6 mm was isolated, extending from the caudal growth plate to its connection with the lateral pedicles. The femoral head was analyzed with a cancellous VOI of 0.4 mm, defined by the tissue between the end of the metaphyseal growth plate and start of the cortical femoral neck. In the femoral neck, a cortical VOI of 0.14 mm segmented the tissue connecting the end of the femoral head region to the femoral shaft. The femoral midshaft was analyzed with a cortical VOI of 0.48 mm, determined by averaging the z-position of the proximal and distal ends of the femur. Lastly, the distal femoral epiphysis had a cancellous VOI of 1.12 mm, extending from the epiphyseal growth plate towards the midshaft (Fig 1C).Digital image analysis The BATch MANager program within CTAn, was used to create task lists for 2D and 3D bone analyses and executed for each of the VOIs cancellous or cortical region [25], and output measurements were obtained for comparison between experimental groups. Cancellous bone in the proximal and distal epiphyses was evaluated using percent bone volume (BV/TV, %), number of trabeculae per mm (Tb.N, 1/mm), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm), trabecular pattern factor (Tb.Pf, 1/mm), and connectivity density (Conn.D, 1/mm3). Cortical bone was evaluated using percent bone area (BA/TA, %), average cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), endosteal perimeter (E.Pm, mm), and periosteal perimeter (P.Pm, mm). Secondary endochondral ossification was visually evaluated in cross-sectional views of the femoral head to determining if the epiphyseal growth plate and mineralized distal cartilage had been converted to the fully ossified cancellous tissue morphology characteristic of SEO.Statistical analysis We used Prism v. 10.1.0 (GraphPad Inc., Boston, Massachusetts), to conduct one-way ANOVA tests between each experimental group for each measurement to identify variability between their means, with α = 0.05 set for the threshold for significance. Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference was implemented for post-hoc analysis, and these p-values were used for significance brackets. To evaluate the magnitude of effect between housing type and spaceflight conditions, the changes of BV/TV in VIV and FL groups relative to GC was calculated. To compare percent change between groups, a one-sample t-test was implemented with a hypothetical mean of zero. A paired t-test was performed between the vertebrae, femoral head, and distal epiphysis within the same sample, which evaluated within-subject variation of bone volume at weight-bearing versus non-weight-bearing site pairs.Results Bone loss in the weight bearing femoral head and distal epiphysis cancellous bone regions depends on housing type and spaceflight in microgravity In the femoral head, BV/TV was significantly decreased in spaceflight compared to all control environments (BL, −25%; VIV, −18%; GC, −27%) (Fig 2A). FL bones also had significantly fewer trabeculae than basal mice (−15%), which was unchanged in the two control habitats (Fig 2B). FL bones showed thinner trabeculae (BL, −16%; GC, −17%) (Fig 2C), an increase in separation (BL, +26%; GC, +22%) (Fig 2D), and a higher pattern factor (BL, +163%; GC, +755%) (Fig 2E) compared to BL and GC bones. Conn.D remained unchanged (Fig 2F). Interestingly, the VIV group had nonsignificant trends of similar magnitude in their trabecular metrics indicating loss as observed in the spaceflight group. VIV bones had more space between trabeculae than the BL control, which was not reflected in GC indicating a housing effect (+18%) (Fig 2D). Overall, the femoral head shows significant bone atrophy expressed in multiple bone parameters after 37 days in space (Fig 2G). Fig 2. Bone loss in the mouse femoral head is associated with weightlessness in microgravity. Open in a new tab Characterization metrics of cancellous bone in the femoral head show that (A) BV/TV is decreased in FL. Bones from FL mice have significantly lower (B) Tb.N and of those trabeculae, spaceflight reduces (C) Tb.Th. Both age and spaceflight increase (D) Tb.Sp, whereas only FL has an increase in (E) Tb.Pf. (F) Conn.D is not significantly affected; however, VIV and FL have similarly reduced Conn.D. VIV bones experience another similar increase in magnitude of Tb.Pf, which was not statistically significant. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, * : p < 0.033, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002, ****: p < 0.0001). (G) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show evident decreased cancellous bone in FL.At the distal epiphysis, BV/TV was significantly decreased in VIV and FL bones from GC levels (VIV, −41%; FL, −55%) (Fig 3A). Similarly to the femoral head, the distal epiphysis in spaceflight samples showed fewer trabeculae as compared to BL (−39%) and GC bones (−42%), which was not observed in VIV bones (Fig 3B). Though trabecular thickness was unchanged (Fig 3C), separation of trabeculae was increased in FL compared to BL and GC (BL, +16%; GC, +14%) (Fig 3D). VIV had significantly higher trabecular separation (+12%) compared to basal mice, a result which was also observed in the femoral head. Spaceflight significantly increased Tb.Pf from GC mice (+27%) (Fig 3E). The FL group had significantly lower connectivity density than BL (−50%) and GC (−52%), which was not seen in the VIV (Fig 3F). This indicates that GC housing in the RH may rescue aging-related bone loss in the distal epiphysis of vivarium cage housed mice. In all trabecular metrics, the VIV group experienced loss trends similar to those in FL bones. Collectively, the data suggest, relative to the RH, the vivarium cage housing allows aging-related bone loss to progress in the cancellous regions of weight bearing bones in the form of fewer trabeculae and fewer plate-like structures (Fig 3G). Fig 3. The loss of bone in the femoral distal epiphysis is affected by housing type and weightlessness conditions in microgravity. Open in a new tab Cancellous bone measurements in the distal epiphysis exhibit a housing-related dependency on (A) BV/TV as well as an effect from spaceflight. (B) Tb.N is decreased in FL following the same patterns as BV/TV. Interestingly, (C) Tb.Th. is not affected by age, cage type, or spaceflight, however age and spaceflight significantly increase (D) Tb.Sp (E) Tb.Pf is only effected in FL. (F) Conn.D is decreased in FL. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, * : p < 0.033, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002). (G) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show visibly decreased presence of bone in VIV and FL.Long bone cortical tissues undergo degenerative changes in space The femoral neck experiences compression and bending forces near its connection to the femoral shaft. We found that BA/TA is significantly lower in FL compared to VIV, although not by a large magnitude (−6%, p < 0.05) (Fig 4A). Ct.Th is not significantly changed between groups, though a trend exists such that the VIV group has thicker cortical bone (Fig 4B). E.Pm is significantly higher in FL than in all other groups (BL, +50%; VIV, +34%; GC, +43%) (Fig 4C), where P.Pm remains unchanged (Fig 4D). These results indicate that cancellous structures in the femoral neck endocortical region may be eroded with spaceflight (Fig 4E). Fig 4. Femoral neck marrow cavity is enlarged in spaceflight but not significantly changed with age and habitat conditions. Open in a new tab Cortical bone characterization metrics in the femoral neck indicate FL has less (A) BA/TA than VIV. Nonsignificant trends in the data show an increase in (B) Ct.Th in VIV that is opposite in FL. (C) E.Pm is significantly increased in VIV, GC, and FL from BL, though (D) P.Pm experiences no changes. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, * : p < 0.033, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002). (E) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show similar presence of bone in BL and GC, while VIV and FL demonstrate erosion in the endosteal surface.With the process of aging to skeletal maturity, cancellous scaffolding is reduced, and the cortical shell of bones becomes thicker providing more withstanding force against loading [26]. This effect is seen between the BL and VIV groups, where BA/TA (+7%, p < 0.005) and Ct.Th (+7%, p < 0.01) increase with time (Fig 5A-B). Spaceflight significantly inhibits this by reducing BA/TA (−6%, p < 0.005) and Ct.Th (−8%, p < 0.005) from VIV levels (Fig 5A-B). Unlike in the femoral neck, there were no effects seen in the E.Pm (Fig 5C), which may be due to the midshaft region lacking cancellous bone while the femoral neck has residual cancellous structures extending from the femoral head. P.Pm remained unchanged in all conditions (Fig 5D). These results indicate that the femoral midshaft experiences significant cortical thinning, which may be attributed to spaceflight (Fig 5E). Fig 5. In the femoral midshaft, spaceflight abrogates increases in bone parameters BA/TA and Ct.Th in controls. Open in a new tab Cortical bone characterization metrics in the femoral midshaft indicate the effect of age increasing (A) BA/TA and (B) Ct.Th, which is undone in FL. (C) E.Pm and (D) P.Pm are unchanged between groups. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002). (E) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show similar presence of bone in BL and GC, while FL demonstrates erosion in the endosteal surface.Load-bearing vertebrae do not show μCT parameter changes related to age, housing, or spaceflight in microgravity Within the L2 vertebrae, our analysis did not detect statistically significant changes to μCT parameters between groups, though there are several nonsignificant trends for small magnitude losses in space. Specifically, parameters like BV/TV, Tb.N, and Tb.Th in FL appear slightly decreased (Fig 6A-F), but the variance in measurements prevents any conclusions from being drawn. Thus, the L2 vertebrae is not significantly affected by housing type or spaceflight, suggesting it is not measurably responsive to weight-bearing load changes. Fig 6. Vertebral cancellous tissueμCT parameters are not significantly affected by aging from 16 to 21 weeks, housing type, or microgravity. Open in a new tab Cancellous bone characterization metrics in the L2 vertebrae demonstrate no differences between groups in (A) BV/TV, (B) Tb.N, (C) Tb.Th, (D) Tb.Sp, (E) Tb.Pf, or (F) Conn.D. Nonsignificant trends implicate an effect of spaceflight reducing BV/TV, increasing DA, and reducing Tb.N. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant). (G) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show a slight decrease in bone parameters from FL mice, which are not deemed significant by statistical testing.Decreased mechanical loading during spaceflight in microgravity only causes significant bone loss in weight-bearing skeletal sites To assess if weight-bearing bone sites in the femur would experience more loss than non-weight-bearing spine, the percent change of the BV/TV of GC samples to the average value of FL was compared using a one-sample t-test with a hypothetical mean of zero (Fig 7A). The vertebrae had an average change of −7% ± 10% (p = ns), while the femoral head lost 27% ± 9% (p < 0.0001) and the distal epiphysis lost 55% ± 10% (p < 0.0001). A paired t-test between the vertebrae and either the femoral head (Fig 7B) or distal epiphysis (Fig 7C) shows significant differences of bone loss within individual samples (p < 0.005). Throughout these results, the vivarium group in standard cages also showed bone loss effects but smaller in magnitude than spaceflight. Using a one-sample t-test and a paired t-test, these trends were quantified. The vertebrae experienced an increase in BV/TV by 8% ± 8% (p < 0.05), where the femoral head and distal epiphysis demonstrate significant bone loss of 12% ± 6% (p < 0.01) and 41% ± 14% (p < 0.0001), respectively (Fig 7D). Within samples, these effects were confirmed as all samples experienced similar degrees of loss from non-weight bearing vertebrae to the weight-bearing femoral head (p < 0.005) (Fig 7E) and distal epiphysis (p < 0.0001) (Fig 7F). Thus, the non-weight-bearing spine bone site did not experience significant change in spaceflight while weight-bearing femoral regions underwent extensive bone loss, indicating weightlessness may be the primary effector of bone loss during spaceflight in LEO. Fig 7. Bone loss in microgravity versus 1g controls in the RH is specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites. Open in a new tab Using one-sample and paired t-tests, findings revealed (A) vertebrae showed no significant change, while the (B) femoral head and (C) distal epiphysis experienced significant bone loss in spaceflight, suggesting that microgravity unloading, but not other systemic factors, caused bone loss in LEO. (D-F) The vivarium cage housing, known to provide reduced topological enrichment, also elicited bone losses of smaller magnitude than spaceflight, but only in weight-bearing bone sites.Secondary endochondral ossification is accelerated during spaceflight in microgravity Following μCT imaging, we characterized the appearance of SEO, a marker of adult skeletal maturation, at both epiphyses in the femur (Fig 8A). As SEO of the femoral head occurs between 21 and 23 weeks of age, bones from the VIV group had twice the occurrences of ossification within the femoral head than BL, and the data shows the GC habitat somewhat rescued this effect. However, FL mice had a 50% ossification rate, 20% above the VIV group, suggesting an increased prevalence of premature skeletal maturation. Interestingly, in the distal epiphysis, GC and FL, and VIV and BL groups had the same occurrences of ossification (Fig 8B), potentially related to distal epiphyseal fusion regulation predominantly by hormonal factors versus mechanotransduction [13]. Fig 8. Spaceflight in microgravity accelerates secondary endochondral ossification of the proximal epiphysis in the femur. Open in a new tab FL bones had 50% of their cohort ossified in the (A) femoral head, over twice as many as in GC cohort. Differences in ossification at BL (16 weeks) and the other groups (21 weeks) in the (B) distal epiphysis appear independent of aging. (C) μCT volumetric reconstructions of the femoral head from a representative sample from each group show increased cavitation in the mineralized cartilage of the VIV and FL groups.Safranin-O staining of the femoral head revealed that the region consisted entirely of hypertrophic cartilage region and a well-defined growth plate between articular cartilage and mineralized bone in baseline bones (Fig 9A). Within the VIV group, sGAG content was depleted in the articular cartilage due to early signs of ossification relative to other groups, although the growth plate remained active (Fig 9B). GC bones had this effect rescued with a maintenance of hypertrophic chondrocytes and cartilage (Fig 9C). The FL sample shows that complete ossification is associated with full sGAG and chondrocyte activity loss within the femoral head (Fig 9D). However, the distal epiphysis provides different results based on the state of SEO. From BL (Fig 9E) to VIV, both classified as pre-SEO with μCT, there is a decrease in sGAG content likely due to aging (Fig 9F). The GC sample, classified as SEO, has slightly less sGAG content than VIV, especially in the trabecular region at the top of the image (Fig 9G), however it does present a continuous area of mineralized tissue along the growth plate. This plate is marked by light pink staining, which is preserved between two continuous areas of bone in the FL example at late-stage SEO (Fig 9H). These observations suggest the process of SEO in the distal femur may induce more chondrocyte activity to rearrange cancellous structure and close the growth plate, however additional studies will be required to elucidate these questions. Fig 9. Spaceflight in microgravity reduces sGAG content in the femoral head and distal epiphysis. Open in a new tab Representative histology of Safranin-O staining on femoral heads, with the (A) BL as the control, show a decrease of proteoglycan content in (B) VIV, a loss of the distinct tidemark in (C) GC, and complete deficit in an ossified sample from (D) FL. The distal epiphyses show ossification-dependent changes to the growth plate. During pre-ossification at 21 weeks (F, VIV), proteoglycan content decreases and is upregulated during ossification (GC, FL) to finalize remodeling into the dual-walled gap characteristic of distal epiphysis secondary ossification.Discussion Spaceflight in LEO is well-documented to cause significant bone loss and is often compared to physiologically aged, osteopenic phenotypes [27,28]. NASA’s early systematic studies of spaceflight effects on rodent bone physiology were conducted in short duration Space Shuttle Space Transportation System (STS) studies lasting ten to fourteen days using the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) in a mid-deck locker. More recent results, with longer durations greater than thirty days on the International Space Station (ISS) use the Rodent Habitat hardware (RH), on the EXPRESS rack and broadly show relatively smaller degenerative bone losses possibly due to rodent acclimation to microgravity [11,19,29]. These effects are thought to be caused throughout bone tissue as a result of cellular proliferation and differentiation homeostasis imbalance between bone forming osteoblasts and bone degrading osteoclasts [30] with osteocytic osteolysis [31] and apoptosis [32] also playing a role. Exceptions to this general assertion have been reported for calvariae [33,34] and mandibles [1,35] with increases or maintenance of bone volume during spaceflight, potentially due to greater mechanical stimulation from elevated intracranial pressure due to microgravity cephalic fluid shift. However, these studies mostly measured acute, short-term spaceflight effects during NASA’s Space Shuttle (STS) era and have limitations as a model for longer-term exposures more relevant to future spaceflight missions. Other experimental variables in spaceflight include species and strain, animal age at launch, experiment duration, ambient temperature, humidity, CO2 concentrations, sample collection methods during or post-flight, and habitat type used. Like the STS AEM, the ISS RH provides a wire-mesh interior, allowing group-housed mice behavior and activities with associated mechanical demands similar to ground-based enriched habitats. Such activities include grappling across the cage to access food, climbing the 3D internal structure, and uniquely for space flown mice, to run in a loop along the perimeter of the habitat [12]. However, these activities only emerged after acclimation to space on days 11 and 12 in the RR-1 mice [12], where other STS experiments would have already concluded or been within a few days of ending. A fundamental distinction between ground-based spaceflight simulations and low-Earth orbit is the type and dosage of radiation. Ground-based simulations often use low LET radiation, such as X-rays, at high acute doses of a few Gray (Gy) [36,37]. In contrast, spaceflight radiation is high linear energy transfer (LET), which has been shown to induce bone loss when acute doses of 1–2 Gy are administered [38]. However, on the ISS, the total high LET radiation dose over 37 days was only ~7.4 mGy, with an average daily dose of 207 µGy [11]. This acute dosage in ground simulations is equivalent to ~13 years of radiation exposure on the ISS delivered instantaneously. While space radiation is commonly considered a potential factor in mediating bone loss in space, the radiation measured over the duration of the RR-1 experiment in LEO is generally not considered sufficient to cause bone loss [11,39]. Therefore, conclusions drawn from ground-based simulations are not directly comparable to spaceflight conditions. Although there are other potential factors that can contribute to bone loss in space such as reactive oxygen species, calcium secretion, and hormonal imbalances [40–43], all these factors are thought to be systemic in the organism and would be expected to cause bone loss across the entire skeletal system. Current literature does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that ROS production is site-specific within bone or bone marrow. Both microgravity and radiation are systemic factors, leading to the conclusion that ROS production affects the skeletal system uniformly. Because of this, we investigated the role of site-specific microgravity mechanical unloading in mediating bone loss, and we sought to test the hypothesis that the effects observed are primarily due to decreased weight-bearing in space and not to other systemic factors. To evaluate these ideas, we conducted μCT analysis on the femoral head, neck, midshaft, distal epiphysis, and L2 vertebrae, both from space flown mice and ground control animals housed in the topologically enriched RH as well as in standard vivarium cages. Through aging, rodents experience decreased bone volume fraction and trabecular number due to remodeling of the bone favoring periosteal cortical development [44–46]. In contrast, dynamic mechanical loading via exercise significantly increases healthy biomechanical properties of bone [47–49]. The femoral head is also a key site of skeletal development and maturation [50], where secondary SEO of the epiphysis, converts the growth plate and mineralized cartilage into cancellous mineralized tissue [51,52]. Concomitantly, the femoral midshaft experiences high bending torsional loads during normal ambulation [53], making disuse of these areas interesting to compare to other sites of the skeleton that are not weight bearing. In the femur shaft, capacity to hold loads is primarily imparted by cortical bone which typically reaches maximum thickness after twelve weeks of age[44] with significant thinning of the cortical wall not occurring until after eight months of age [54]. Fracture risk is also increased with age [55,56] as cortical bone becomes brittle [57–61] with structural disruption [62], likely due to dysfunctional remodeling [63,64] that may prevent micro-fracture repair [65]. STS missions show insignificant acute changes in cortical bone [17], but long-term loss is resistant to post-flight recovery [66]. Thus, vertebrae might reveal potential systemic bone degenerative effects not associated with microgravity weightlessness unloading as expected in the femur. Furthermore, the RH wire mesh interior is associated with increased mouse physical activity that occurs during long-duration spaceflight after initial acclimation [12] and may load this region of the spine, possibly attenuating minor weightlessness unloading effects. If space radiation in LEO or other systemic factors were the primary effectors of bone loss during spaceflight, we would expect systemic changes to the skeletal system. In that context, for ionizing radiation, we might also expect that thick, minerally dense regions of cortical bone could partially shield the bone marrow cavity and cancellous bone. This, however, does not appear to be the case, as our data shows the vertebral thin cortical and cancellous bone are unchanged in spaceflight (Fig 6), but the femoral neck, which has a substantial cortical region, experiences endosteal cancellous tissue loss (Fig 4). Therefore, our data strongly indicate that spaceflight-induced bone loss, is localized to two well-established direct weight-bearing skeletal locations in the femoral head and distal epiphyses. Moreover, the absence of significant bone loss in the L2 lumbar vertebra after 37 days of spaceflight is consistent with previous scans of L4 archived on NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSD-489, Alwood, et. al.). On Earth, the mechanical loading environment within the rodent spinal column is complex, including time- and position-varying loads of lateral bending, flexion/extension, and axial rotation dependent on the task being performed [67,68]. Despite the variation in the gravity vector with respect to the spine orientation, the vertebral body in both humans and quadrupeds experiences intermittent compressive forces and display unique fabric orientation of the cancellous tissue to the gravity vector while on Earth [68]. The response to spaceflight is less understood and likely varies by habitat topology, housing density, age, and experiment duration [10]. As active behaviors are abundantly observed in the RR-1 experiment, we infer the mice are mechanically loading their vertebral body by compression. In contrast, animals housed in the Russian Bion M-1 Habitat, with three mice per enclosure and smooth tubular walls resulting in low topological complexity [69], or in the Japanese Habitat Cage Unit, with single-housed mice and perforated walls that allowed grappling resulting in medium topological complexity [70,71], do not allow for the same running activity. To this effect, mice in the Russian Bion M-1 Habitat, significantly lost cancellous bone in the vertebral body compared to standard housing conditions [72]. Additionally, previous studies from our group using the hindlimb unloading model showed cancellous bone in the lumbar vertebra of male mice to be sensitive to musculoskeletal disuse, resulting in bone loss [73]. Taken together with the running activities and resulting intermittent compression on the ventral spine during RR-1 [12], we interpret the hindlimb unloading model to place less of a mechanical demand on the vertebral column compared to space flown and running mice. Furthermore, we used same-animal paired t-test analyses of bone parameters in weight-bearing bones such as the femur and load-bearing vertebrae to establish, with greater statistical power than one-sample t-test or ANOVA alone, that while the former are subject to loss in space, the latter are not. Additionally, bones from mice in the RH show healthier parameters in directly loaded regions than those from the vivarium (Fig 7). Systemic effects in the vertebrae, if present, should result in weaker cancellous structures and cortical bone would not have experienced the magnitudes of endocortical erosion, as shown in our data. We acknowledge that other potential systemic changes in bone tissue [74,75] may affect mechanical properties of bone, but the data strongly suggest that increased activity and microgravity have opposite effects on bone health parameters only at specific locations within weight bearing bone and no significant effects in bones primarily loaded by muscle tension, as long as the habitat used, such as RH, is permissive of physical activity in space. The totality of the data compellingly supports mechanical unloading as the primary effector of bone loss during spaceflight in LEO. This study also reports a previously unknown accelerated SEO effect of spaceflight on the femur. The role of SEO is to conclude the lengthening of long bones and serves as a developmental marker for skeletal maturation [51]. This process is likely mediated by transdifferentiation from chondroprogenitors to osteoprogenitors [76,77]. The results of our study suggest the femoral head initiates SEO with an increase in chondroprogenitor expression evidenced by an increase in sGAG content. Images of ossified bone demonstrate that this tidemark is propagated through the remaining articular cartilage until mineralized trabeculae constitute the entirety of the femoral head. In the distal epiphysis, the upregulation of chondrocyte activity is also demonstrated, however the plate does not dissolve to uniform mineralization, rather it maintains a layer of sGAGs between the mineralized bone in the marrow cavity and mineralized articular cartilage in the condyles. The percentage of SEO bones increased with age from BL to VIV groups. Interestingly, the effect of spaceflight on the progression of SEO was shown to accelerate complete ossification in the femoral head above the rate observed with aging. Concurrently, increased loading via activity experienced in the GC habitat mouse bones decreased the occurrence of ossification (Fig 8). Thus, bone mineralization homeostasis and SEO onset appears dependent on the magnitude of mechanical loading and unloading. Given that accelerated SEO is a significant physiological spaceflight effect, we checked additional archival μCT datasets. The 30-day Bion M-1 spaceflight experiment 19-week male mice also showed accelerated SEO, suggesting this is not an observation unique to the RR-1 study (unpublished results). This, however, was not found in other shorter flight experiments such as in the STS-131 Mouse Immunology spaceflight experiment with younger 14-week females (results in preparation). Common factors between RR-1 and Bion M-1 spaceflight experiments include a duration greater than 30 days both with mice ages nearing the onset of normal SEO which occurs at 21–23 weeks. Additional studies are needed to fully characterize the femoral head metaphyseal plate dynamics throughout the entire SEO process in the context of age, sex, and altered weight-bearing loading in microgravity. This study supports the hypothesis that bone loss effects we observe in the 37-day RR-1 spaceflight in LEO is site-specific and likely due to mechanical unloading and not space radiation or other systemic factors. It is unlikely that low levels of space radiation, as experienced in LEO, could have systemic effects capable of mediating bone loss, as there are no reports of simulated space radiation effects at this dose and dose rate in cortical bone or lumbar vertebrae. This study, however, does not rule out the likely possibility that longer exposures, or more energetic charged particle space radiation outside of LEO will have significant bone effects. Additionally, the novel observation of accelerated epiphyseal closure in the femoral head primary weight-bearing location in mice, suggests mechanical unloading may accelerate SEO of juvenile growing long bones into a prematurely mature state. The totality of the data strongly supports mechanical unloading due to weightlessness in microgravity, not radiation or other systemic factors, as the primary effector of spaceflight-related bone loss in LEO.Acknowledgments EACA and JSA were supported by NASA Human Research Program (HRP) Cross Cutting Initiative.
