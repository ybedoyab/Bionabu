    "introduction": "Introduction During growth on the International Space Station (ISS), plants encounter a suite of abiotic stressors largely owing to the effects of microgravity, cosmic radiation, and other less-characterized stresses associated with the spaceflight environment. Similar to observations made in response to terrestrial plant stresses, exposure to the spaceflight environment triggers a unique transcriptional response.1–4 Patterns of spaceflight-induced gene expression have been analyzed in a variety of experiments carried out onboard the ISS, with focus on dissecting the transcriptome at the resolution of individual genes rather than transcript isoforms.1–4 Alternative splicing (AS) is the phenomenon by which exons and introns can be differentially joined together to result in the production of multiple distinct transcript isoforms derived from a single parent gene locus (reviewed in ref. 5). AS greatly enhances the diversity of the eukaryotic transcriptome. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, as many as 60% of intron-containing genes undergo AS.6 In addition, unique AS patterns arise in response to terrestrial plant stressors.5,7–11 To investigate the role of AS during spaceflight adaptation in plants, RNA sequencing data collected during the APEX03 experiment from A. thaliana seedlings grown on board the ISS in comparison to seedlings grown as ground controls at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) were analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline specifically developed to be aware of AS events (adapted from ref. 12). The APEX03 experiment featured two different A. thaliana ecotypes, Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (WS), and involved RNA sequencing of root tissue from both 4- and 8-day-old seedlings grown on 10 cm2 petri plates containing Phytagel then preserved in RNALater on orbit. These time points were chosen because by 8 days of growth Arabidopsis seedlings will transition to photosynthesizing using true leaves, which is a major shift during seedling development. Root morphological differences between Col-0 and WS cultivars have been studied in spaceflight previously: Col-0 is known to exhibit much weaker root skewing in microgravity, compared to the strong rightward root skewing observed in the WS ecotype.13 Following RNA sequencing, the raw reads were processed using a bioinformatics pipeline designed to analyze the transcriptome with resolution at the level of individual transcript isoforms (Fig. 1a) (adapted from ref. 12). This pipeline differs from standard pipelines utilized to assess differential gene expression in that three distinct transcript assembly programs are used to maximize the robustness of transcript isoform discovery.12 Presence/absence variation (PAV) of AS isoforms was then performed utilizing extremely stringent criteria to identify the expression level differences in AS isoforms between spaceflight and ground controls. To count an AS isoform as present in each condition, the isoform was required to be expressed at an FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) ≥10 in all four biological replicates of a given condition and was required to come from a parent gene that undergoes AS as identified by the pipeline used in this analysis. By using a high FPKM value as a strict expression level cutoff and eliminating results with biological variation, lists of AS isoforms strongly present in each condition were generated with high confidence (Supplementary Data File 1). Consequentially, AS isoforms considered absent in each condition may not be entirely absent but rather not expressed at a high enough level to be classified as present in this analysis. This PAV analysis resulted in the identification of AS isoforms with expression-level differences between spaceflight and ground control samples in both ecotypes and developmental stages tested (Fig. 1b). Orthogonal validation of AS isoforms counted as present or absent was performed by re-aligning the RNA sequencing reads to the reference genome utilizing a separate alignment program. Sequencing depth and splice junction coverage were then assessed using Integrative Genomics Viewer14 to experimentally validate a subset of the isoforms counted as present or absent in each condition (Supplementary Fig. 1–4). PAV analysis therefore enabled the identification of AS isoforms with expression-level differences in spaceflight, which reflects behavior of the transcriptional machinery within the cell. Fig. 1.

Steps inside the dashed outline were performed on each individual replicate. See Methods for more detail on gtf merging. b Comparison of alternatively spliced isoforms present or absent in spaceflight in both ecotypes and developmental ages tested. c Count of differentially alternatively spliced genes and the associated count of transcript isoforms observed in each condition. d Comparison of the differentially alternatively spliced genes observed in the Columbia-0 (Col-0) or the Wassilewskija (WS) ecotype background. Differentially alternatively spliced genes observed at both 4- and 8-day time points in either ecotype background were pooled for this analysis. (C Columbia-0, W Wassilewskija, 4 4 days of age, 8 8 days of age. C4 Columbia-0 4 days of age, W8 Wassilewskija 8 days of age) Specific genes that undergo significant differential AS (dAS) were identified using CuffDiff15 to investigate whether decisions made by the splicing machinery differ in response to spaceflight. In both ecotypes and both developmental stages tested in this analysis, genes that undergo significant dAS between spaceflight and ground control samples were identified (Fig. 1c). Genes were identified as dAS if the isoform ratio differs significantly between the conditions examined (Supplementary Data File 2). A difference in isoform ratio between conditions is indicative of a difference in splicing decision between conditions, which is independent of transcription-level differences. Interestingly, fewer genes undergo dAS in the Col-0 ecotype background collectively as compared to WS, which is opposite of the pattern observed in the literature between these two ecotypes regarding differentially expressed genes.2 Comparison of the genes that undergo dAS in either the Col-0 or the WS background reveals very little overlap in the identity of the genes alternatively spliced in response to spaceflight (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, gene ontology analysis does not reveal any obvious conclusions regarding the function or localization of the genes undergoing AS during spaceflight exposure. An example of dAS between spaceflight and ground controls in both Col-0 and WS is presented as an Integrative Genomics Viewer14 image that visualizes differences in sequencing coverage between AS isoforms of the gene AT2G33770 (Fig. 2a). This gene locus produces three AS transcript isoforms that utilize the same transcription start site—TCONS_00029094, TCONS_00029095, and TCONS_00029096. One AS isoform, TCONS_00029094, is only very lowly expressed in all conditions tested. However, AS isoform TCONS_00029095 is more common in spaceflight samples, whereas AS isoform TCONS_00029096 is more common in ground control samples (Fig. 2a, b). This example highlights a difference in pre-mRNA processing in response to spaceflight—a spliceosome-specific behavior as opposed to a difference in transcription. Fig. 2.

Isoform ratio was calculated by FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) This study represents the first observation of transcriptome-wide spaceflight-induced AS not only in plants but also in any living organism yet exposed to microgravity. The results presented here serve as strong evidence that AS has a role during the molecular adaptation process to the spaceflight environment in higher eukaryotic organisms such as plants and provides methods that can be used to identify AS isoforms from RNA sequencing datasets generated from other spaceflight-exposed organisms. However, the full role of AS during spaceflight adaptation must still be investigated by examining changes in the abundance of AS isoforms present in both conditions, the types of AS events occurring in spaceflight, and the functional implications of AS isoforms present or absent in spaceflight. In addition, it would be interesting to analyze the overlap between spaceflight differentially expressed genes and spaceflight-induced AS isoforms. Dissecting the spaceflight-induced transcriptome with both gene- and AS isoform-level resolution will elucidate better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leveraged by plants to adapt to the radically novel environment, that is, spaceflight.",
    "methods": "Methods Data acquisition—APEX03-2 spaceflight experiment A subset of the data collected during the Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2 (APEX03-2) spaceflight experiment was utilized for this analysis. The APEX03-2 experimental methods have been previously described16 including detailed descriptions of the mission in which the experiment was launched, plant material preparations, and plant growth conditions both onboard the ISS and at KSC where ground controls were comparably grown. For this analysis, the data utilized comes from two wild-type accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0 and WS) sampled at both 4 and 8 days of age during the experiment. It should be noted that the APEX03-2 experiment is also referred to as “TAGES-ISA” (Transgenic Gene Expression System-Intracellular Signaling Architecture) by NASA operations nomenclature (http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1059.html). Growth conditions and plant handling Seeds sown on 10 cm2 petri plates were kept dormant during launch. Germination was initiated after transfer to the Vegetable Production System (VEGGIE) onboard the ISS or at KSC for ground controls. The plates were kept in vertical racks perpendicularly oriented to the light source during growth in VEGGIE. Lighting within the VEGGIE unit was set to provide between 100 and 135 µmoles/m2/s PAR (photosynthetic active radiation). Telemetric data collected on board the ISS during the spaceflight experiment were utilized to precisely mimic the environment onboard the ISS during the ground control experiment, carried out in the ISS Environmental Simulation Chamber at KSC. General methods associated with harvesting plant matter while on orbit for transcriptome analyses, plate de-integration once returned back to KSC, and transport back to the laboratory of the Principal Investigators for analysis has been described in detail for previous spaceflight experiments.4 RNA extraction and sequencing Four biological replicates were analyzed for each condition tested in the APEX03-2 experiment, where one replicate corresponds to the 10–15 plants grown on one petri plate. The plant material constituting each replicate was then subdivided for use in multiple downstream applications. Five to eight individual plants from each replicate of 4-day-old seedlings were combined for RNA extraction. However, to ensure that similar RNA concentrations from replicates containing 8 day-old seedlings were obtained, only 2–3 individual plants from each replicate of 8 day-old seedlings were pooled for RNA extraction. An Olympus dissecting microscope was utilized to separate leaf and root samples, while hypocotyl regions were set aside. Total RNA was extracted from the dissected roots using the Qiashredder and RNAeasy™ kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA). Remnant DNA was removed via an on-column digestion utilizing RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). RNA quality was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A cDNA library was produced using the CloneTech SMART-Seq V4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Clonetech Laboratories, Inc, cat#: 634890). Illumina sequencing libraries were then prepared via the Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Cat#: FC-131-1024). Bioanalyzer and quantitative PCR were used to quantify the libraries produced. Pooled equimolar samples were then sequenced using the NextSeq500 instrument in five separate flow cells. AS bioinformatics pipeline and downstream processing Quality control was done to remove low quality reads and bases with Trimmomatic17 using parameters TRAILING:3, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20, MINLEN:20. Reads were aligned to the A. thaliana version 10 reference genome (accessed from https://genome.jgi.doe.gov) with Bowtie2 version 2.2.918 with parameter –fr. Low quality alignments were filtered out by piping the Bowtie2 output into Samtools19 via samtools view –q 30 –b | samtools sort. Picard 2.5.0 (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) was used with the parameter REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true to remove potential optical duplicates from the alignments. Transcript assemblies were conducted for each sample using three separate transcript assembly programs. Cufflinks15 was used with parameters –library-type fr-firststrand –u -F 0.05–max-intron-length 12000–no-faux-reads utilizing the A. thaliana version 9 reference genome and A. thaliana version 10 genome annotation (accessed from https://genome.jgi.doe.gov) to guide transcript assembly. StringTie20 was used with parameters -f 0.05 -j 2 –rf using the same genome and annotation as Cufflinks to guide assemblies. Trinity21 was used in genome guided mode with parameters –genome_guided_bam–genome_guided_max_intron 12000–full_cleanup–SS_lib_type RF–min_contig_length 50. The assemblies from Cufflinks and Stringtie were merged using the Stringtie merge function for each sample using parameters -F 1 -f 0.05. PASA22 was used to reconcile this merged assembly and the assembly from Trinity using parameters -C –R -t 〈Trinity fasta output〉 –cufflinks_gtf 〈merged gtf file〉 -I 12000–ALT_SPLICE–ALIGNER gmap, blat. The transcriptome assemblies generated by PASA for each sample were merged with Cuffmerge. The file produced by Cuffmerge was then reformatted to agree with the reference genome annotation format and then compared against the reference annotation using gffcompare (https://github.com/gpertea/gffcompare). This merged transcriptome represents all potential transcript isoforms expressed in all of the samples being studied, including both newly discovered isoforms and those previously annotated. The abundance of transcripts in each sample was then quantified with the rsem-calculate-expression functionality within RSEM23 using default parameters. The FPKM values of each transcript from each sample were parsed from the RSEM output into a matrix. This matrix was used for downstream analysis of PAV of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms. All isoforms expressed from parent genes without a minimum of two unique transcript isoforms identified within the dataset were removed. This category of discarded isoforms represents isoforms that were not produced as a product of AS as identified by the pipeline used in this analysis. In addition, within each condition all isoforms expressed at an FPKM < 10 in at least one out of four replicates were removed from the analysis. Following filtering, lists of spaceflight present, ground control present, and commonly present AS isoforms were generated. A second round of alignments was done with STAR24 version 2.5.2b using parameters –alignIntronMax 12000–outFilterMismatchNmax 8–sjdbOverhang 100–outSJfilterReads Unique–outSAMmultNmax 1–outFilterType BySJout to generate files for junction spanning alignments. These alignments were filtered for duplicate reads using Picard with the parameter REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true. STAR allows for the alignment of junction spanning reads, whereas RSEM utilizes Bowtie for alignments, which does not allow for the alignment of these reads. Sequencing depth and splice junction support for a subset of isoforms present or absent in each condition and ecotype was then visualized using Integrative Genomics Viewer14 (Supplementary Fig. 1–4). The alignments from STAR were also used as inputs into Cuffdiff.15 Cuffdiff was run using this merged transcriptome as a reference gtf file to discover differential transcription start site usage between spaceflight and ground controls in both ecotypes and developmental stages tested in this analysis. The transcription start sites of isoforms exhibiting differential splicing were parsed from the splicing.diff file output from Cuffdiff for each condition being tested. The isoforms associated with the transcription start sites were parsed from the isoforms.fpkm_tracking Cuffdiff output file and the expression, in FPKM, of these isoforms was parsed from the isoforms.read_group_tracking Cuffdiff output file. The isoform ratios were then calculated using a Python script for isoforms encoded from the same gene and sharing a transcription start site. All isoforms demonstrating an isoform ratio <0.01 in both spaceflight and ground control samples within a given condition were removed, resulting in the generation of lists of genes and their associated isoforms that undergo differential AS in each condition tested (Supplementary Data File 2).

Similar to observations made in response to terrestrial plant stresses, exposure to the spaceflight environment triggers a unique transcriptional response.1–4 Patterns of spaceflight-induced gene expression have been analyzed in a variety of experiments carried out onboard the ISS, with focus on dissecting the transcriptome at the resolution of individual genes rather than transcript isoforms.1–4 Alternative splicing (AS) is the phenomenon by which exons and introns can be differentially joined together to result in the production of multiple distinct transcript isoforms derived from a single parent gene locus (reviewed in ref. 5). AS greatly enhances the diversity of the eukaryotic transcriptome. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, as many as 60% of intron-containing genes undergo AS.6 In addition, unique AS patterns arise in response to terrestrial plant stressors.5,7–11 To investigate the role of AS during spaceflight adaptation in plants, RNA sequencing data collected during the APEX03 experiment from A. thaliana seedlings grown on board the ISS in comparison to seedlings grown as ground controls at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) were analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline specifically developed to be aware of AS events (adapted from ref. 12). The APEX03 experiment featured two different A. thaliana ecotypes, Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (WS), and involved RNA sequencing of root tissue from both 4- and 8-day-old seedlings grown on 10 cm2 petri plates containing Phytagel then preserved in RNALater on orbit. These time points were chosen because by 8 days of growth Arabidopsis seedlings will transition to photosynthesizing using true leaves, which is a major shift during seedling development. Root morphological differences between Col-0 and WS cultivars have been studied in spaceflight previously: Col-0 is known to exhibit much weaker root skewing in microgravity, compared to the strong rightward root skewing observed in the WS ecotype.13 Following RNA sequencing, the raw reads were processed using a bioinformatics pipeline designed to analyze the transcriptome with resolution at the level of individual transcript isoforms (Fig. 1a) (adapted from ref. 12).

An example of dAS between spaceflight and ground controls in both Col-0 and WS is presented as an Integrative Genomics Viewer14 image that visualizes differences in sequencing coverage between AS isoforms of the gene AT2G33770 (Fig. 2a). This gene locus produces three AS transcript isoforms that utilize the same transcription start site—TCONS_00029094, TCONS_00029095, and TCONS_00029096. One AS isoform, TCONS_00029094, is only very lowly expressed in all conditions tested. However, AS isoform TCONS_00029095 is more common in spaceflight samples, whereas AS isoform TCONS_00029096 is more common in ground control samples (Fig. 2a, b).

In addition, it would be interesting to analyze the overlap between spaceflight differentially expressed genes and spaceflight-induced AS isoforms. Dissecting the spaceflight-induced transcriptome with both gene- and AS isoform-level resolution will elucidate better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leveraged by plants to adapt to the radically novel environment, that is, spaceflight.Methods Data acquisition—APEX03-2 spaceflight experiment A subset of the data collected during the Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2 (APEX03-2) spaceflight experiment was utilized for this analysis. The APEX03-2 experimental methods have been previously described16 including detailed descriptions of the mission in which the experiment was launched, plant material preparations, and plant growth conditions both onboard the ISS and at KSC where ground controls were comparably grown.

Germination was initiated after transfer to the Vegetable Production System (VEGGIE) onboard the ISS or at KSC for ground controls. The plates were kept in vertical racks perpendicularly oriented to the light source during growth in VEGGIE. Lighting within the VEGGIE unit was set to provide between 100 and 135 µmoles/m2/s PAR (photosynthetic active radiation). Telemetric data collected on board the ISS during the spaceflight experiment were utilized to precisely mimic the environment onboard the ISS during the ground control experiment, carried out in the ISS Environmental Simulation Chamber at KSC. General methods associated with harvesting plant matter while on orbit for transcriptome analyses, plate de-integration once returned back to KSC, and transport back to the laboratory of the Principal Investigators for analysis has been described in detail for previous spaceflight experiments.4RNA extraction and sequencing Four biological replicates were analyzed for each condition tested in the APEX03-2 experiment, where one replicate corresponds to the 10–15 plants grown on one petri plate. The plant material constituting each replicate was then subdivided for use in multiple downstream applications. Five to eight individual plants from each replicate of 4-day-old seedlings were combined for RNA extraction. However, to ensure that similar RNA concentrations from replicates containing 8 day-old seedlings were obtained, only 2–3 individual plants from each replicate of 8 day-old seedlings were pooled for RNA extraction. An Olympus dissecting microscope was utilized to separate leaf and root samples, while hypocotyl regions were set aside. Total RNA was extracted from the dissected roots using the Qiashredder and RNAeasy™ kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA). Remnant DNA was removed via an on-column digestion utilizing RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany).

Reads were aligned to the A. thaliana version 10 reference genome (accessed from https://genome.jgi.doe.gov) with Bowtie2 version 2.2.918 with parameter –fr. Low quality alignments were filtered out by piping the Bowtie2 output into Samtools19 via samtools view –q 30 –b | samtools sort. Picard 2.5.0 (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) was used with the parameter REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true to remove potential optical duplicates from the alignments. Transcript assemblies were conducted for each sample using three separate transcript assembly programs. Cufflinks15 was used with parameters –library-type fr-firststrand –u -F 0.05–max-intron-length 12000–no-faux-reads utilizing the A. thaliana version 9 reference genome and A. thaliana version 10 genome annotation (accessed from https://genome.jgi.doe.gov) to guide transcript assembly. StringTie20 was used with parameters -f 0.05 -j 2 –rf using the same genome and annotation as Cufflinks to guide assemblies. Trinity21 was used in genome guided mode with parameters –genome_guided_bam–genome_guided_max_intron 12000–full_cleanup–SS_lib_type RF–min_contig_length 50. The assemblies from Cufflinks and Stringtie were merged using the Stringtie merge function for each sample using parameters -F 1 -f 0.05. PASA22 was used to reconcile this merged assembly and the assembly from Trinity using parameters -C –R -t 〈Trinity fasta output〉 –cufflinks_gtf 〈merged gtf file〉 -I 12000–ALT_SPLICE–ALIGNER gmap, blat. The transcriptome assemblies generated by PASA for each sample were merged with Cuffmerge. The file produced by Cuffmerge was then reformatted to agree with the reference genome annotation format and then compared against the reference annotation using gffcompare (https://github.com/gpertea/gffcompare). This merged transcriptome represents all potential transcript isoforms expressed in all of the samples being studied, including both newly discovered isoforms and those previously annotated. The abundance of transcripts in each sample was then quantified with the rsem-calculate-expression functionality within RSEM23 using default parameters. The FPKM values of each transcript from each sample were parsed from the RSEM output into a matrix. This matrix was used for downstream analysis of PAV of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms. All isoforms expressed from parent genes without a minimum of two unique transcript isoforms identified within the dataset were removed. This category of discarded isoforms represents isoforms that were not produced as a product of AS as identified by the pipeline used in this analysis. In addition, within each condition all isoforms expressed at an FPKM < 10 in at least one out of four replicates were removed from the analysis. Following filtering, lists of spaceflight present, ground control present, and commonly present AS isoforms were generated. A second round of alignments was done with STAR24 version 2.5.2b using parameters –alignIntronMax 12000–outFilterMismatchNmax 8–sjdbOverhang 100–outSJfilterReads Unique–outSAMmultNmax 1–outFilterType BySJout to generate files for junction spanning alignments. These alignments were filtered for duplicate reads using Picard with the parameter REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true. STAR allows for the alignment of junction spanning reads, whereas RSEM utilizes Bowtie for alignments, which does not allow for the alignment of these reads. Sequencing depth and splice junction support for a subset of isoforms present or absent in each condition and ecotype was then visualized using Integrative Genomics Viewer14 (Supplementary Fig. 1–4). The alignments from STAR were also used as inputs into Cuffdiff.15 Cuffdiff was run using this merged transcriptome as a reference gtf file to discover differential transcription start site usage between spaceflight and ground controls in both ecotypes and developmental stages tested in this analysis. The transcription start sites of isoforms exhibiting differential splicing were parsed from the splicing.diff file output from Cuffdiff for each condition being tested. The isoforms associated with the transcription start sites were parsed from the isoforms.fpkm_tracking Cuffdiff output file and the expression, in FPKM, of these isoforms was parsed from the isoforms.read_group_tracking Cuffdiff output file. The isoform ratios were then calculated using a Python script for isoforms encoded from the same gene and sharing a transcription start site. All isoforms demonstrating an isoform ratio <0.01 in both spaceflight and ground control samples within a given condition were removed, resulting in the generation of lists of genes and their associated isoforms that undergo differential AS in each condition tested (Supplementary Data File 2).Reporting Summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplemental Figures (1.6MB, pdf) Supplemental Data File 1 (606KB, xlsx) Supplemental Data File 2 (66KB, xlsx) reporting summary (1.3MB, pdf) Acknowledgements We thank the personnel at Kennedy Space Center and astronauts on board the International Space Station for their assistance with the APEX03 experiment.

    "abstract": "Abstract The EDEN ISS greenhouse is a space-analog test facility near the German Neumayer III station in Antarctica. The facility is part of the project of the same name and was designed and built starting from March 2015 and eventually deployed in Antarctica in January 2018. The nominal operation of the greenhouse started on February 7th and continued until the 20th of November. The purpose of the facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. Research on food quality and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human factors and horticultural sciences was conducted. Part of the latter is the determination of the biomass production of the different crops. The data on this topic is presented in this paper. During the first season 26 different crops were grown on the 12.5 m2 cultivation area of the greenhouse. A large number of crops were grown continuously throughout the 9 months of operation, but there were also crops that were only grown a few times for test purposes. The focus of this season was on growing lettuce, leafy greens and fresh vegetables. In total more than 268 kg of edible biomass was produced by the EDEN ISS greenhouse facility in 2018. Most of the harvest was cucumbers (67 kg), lettuces (56 kg), leafy greens (49 kg), and tomatoes (50 kg) complemented with smaller amounts of herbs (12 kg), radish (8 kg), and kohlrabi (19 kg). The environmental set points for the crops were 330–600 μmol/(m2*s) LED light, 21°C, ∼65% relative humidity, 1000 ppm and the photoperiod was 17 h per day. The overall yearly productivity of the EDEN ISS greenhouse in 2018 was 27.4 kg/m2, which is equal to 0.075 kg/(m2*d). This paper shows in detail the data on edible and inedible biomass production of each crop grown in the EDEN ISS greenhouse in Antarctica during the 2018 season. Keywords: bio-regenerative life support system (BLSS), plant cultivation chamber, space plant growth facility, space food and nutrition, space analog studies, controlled environment agriculture (CEA)",
    "introduction": "Introduction Food production during human space missions to and on Moon and Mars is a necessary step to reduce resupply mass from Earth and thus long-term mission costs. Growing plants for food production also offers the advantages of producing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as well as the recycling of water. Because of these advantages, experiments in growing plants in space began as early as the first manned space stations and continue to the present day (Zabel et al., 2016a). Several research teams conducted experiments in cultivating plants in a closed controlled environment on Earth for the application in future space missions in the past (Wheeler, 2017). Notable are NASA’s Biomass Production Chamber (Wheeler et al., 2003; Dreschel et al., 2018), the Russian BIOS facilities (Gitelson et al., 2003), the Japanese Closed Ecology Experimental Facility (Nitta, 2005) and the Chinese Lunar Palace 1 (Fu et al., 2016). The EDEN ISS project is the newest space greenhouse analog project to test subsystems, technologies, operation procedures, plant health monitoring devices and plant cultivation for future space missions. The EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility (MTF) (Figure 1) was setup in Antarctica to achieve these goals. This paper presents detailed values on food production (edible biomass) and inedible biomass production of the vegetable crops cultivated in the experimental phase in 2018. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab The EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility in Antarctica around 400 m south of the German Neumayer Station III. The difference of the EDEN ISS MTF to the other facilities is its unique location. The MTF is positioned in the vicinity of the German Neumayer Station III in Antarctica. This continent offers several conditions which are favorable for space analog test campaigns (Bubenheim et al., 1994). While most of the other facilities were built to conduct research on humans living in a closed loop life support system, EDEN ISS focuses on cultivating plants in controlled conditions, testing the necessary hardware and investigating microbiology, food quality and safety aspects. Furthermore, most of the facilities mentioned earlier were built and operated in the 1980s–2000s and are no longer available, except for Lunar Palace 1 which was built only a few years ago and is still in operation. EDEN ISS also uses technologies which were not available in the past (e.g., LED lighting for plant cultivation). The novel aspect of the EDEN ISS project is its approach to work with a compromise climate in which all crops are grown simultaneously. This is more realistic for near-term space greenhouses as compared to studies were each crop has its own optimized climate. Despite not having the optimal climate for each crop the food production of the MTF in the 2018 season was higher than expected. In 2018, for the first time a comprehensive set of measurements were performed in an analog space greenhouse. These measurements encompass the biomass production data presented in this paper, but also data on the microbial environment inside the greenhouse, the quality and safety of the produced food, the resources (e.g., carbon dioxide, nutrients, consumables) necessary to grow the crops, the amount of electrical energy and crewtime required and the acceptance of the food to the station crew. The biomass production dataset presented in this paper can be used to improve simulation models for space greenhouses. It can also be used for cultivar selection, because the dataset includes values on different cultivars (e.g., for lettuce and tomato) which is helpful to assess which cultivar should be grown in the next space greenhouse. The data is also a valuable contribution to the recently developed Crop Readiness Level evaluation method (Romeyn et al., 2019) for crop candidates for space greenhouses.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility Infrastructure The EDEN ISS MTF is located in the immediate vicinity of the Neumayer III Station which is operated by the German Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research. The MTF was designed and built as an experimental facility for plant cultivation systems, allowing the test of essential technologies and production procedures for future long-duration human space missions (Zabel et al., 2015). Detailed system analysis was conducted by the consortium partners resulting in a solid design (Bamsey et al., 2014, 2016; Zabel et al., 2016b), including a complete risk assessment (Santos et al., 2016). The MTF consists of two customized 20 foot high cube shipping containers, which are placed on top of a raised platform located ∼400 m south of Neumayer III. The research facility can be subdivided into three distinct sections: •Airlock/Cold-Porch (Blue section in Figure 2): A small room providing storage and a small air buffer to limit the entry of cold air when the main access door of the facility is used. This area is used for changing clothes. Furthermore, the main fresh water tank and the waste water tank are both located in the subfloor space of this section. •Service Section (Red section in Figure 2): This section houses the primary control, atmosphere management, thermal control, power control and nutrient delivery systems of the MTF (Vrakking et al., 2017). Additionally, this section provides a working table including sink, trash bins, and storage for tools and consumables. In addition this section houses an independent rack-like plant cultivation system as part of the plant growth demonstrator for future deployment onboard the ISS (Boscheri et al., 2016, 2017). •Future Exploration Greenhouse (FEG) (Green section in Figure 2): The main plant cultivation space of the MTF which includes multi-level plant growth racks operating in a controlled environment. The FEG is used to study plant cultivation and the related technologies for future planetary habitats (Zabel et al., 2017). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Schematic top-view of the MTF. The blue section indicates the cold porch. The red area is called service section and houses a work desk and almost all greenhouse subsystems. The green section is the main plant cultivation space, called the FEG.The technologies required to cultivate plants in a controlled environment are arranged in six different subsystems, which are briefly described in the following. Detailed information about the subsystems can be found in Zabel et al. (2017) and Vrakking et al. (2017). 1)The nutrient delivery subsystem adjusts the irrigation water’s pH and EC value. Depending on the plant type (leafy or fruit-building crop), the mixing computer provides a dedicated nutrient solution that is delivered directly to the roots. Eight high-pressure pumps spray a fine nutrient mist inside the root compartment of each plant tray. 2)The atmosphere management subsystem regulates the temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration within the FEG. Furthermore, the air flow is filtered (particle filter, HEPA, and activated carbon filter) and the humidity condensate water is recovered and fed back to the fresh water tank. 3)The thermal control subsystem is used to remove excess heat from the MTF and to provide a cool fluid for condensation of the humidity produced by the plants. 4)The illumination control subsystem consists of 42 fluid-cooled LED fixtures integrated into the FEG. The light spectrum can freely be composed of red, blue, far-red, and white for each plant tray. 5)The power distribution subsystem provides electrical energy to all subsystems of the MTF. The electrical energy is generated in the Neumayer Station III and transmitted to the MTF. 6)The control and data handling subsystem consists of a set of independent programmable logic controllers which receive information from a wide range of sensors. Based on this information and defined program logics this subsystem controls all functions of the MTF. The control and data handling subsystem sends system telemetry to the mission control center in Bremen, Germany. Furthermore, every day a set of images taken from fixed positions inside the FEG is sent to the mission control center to allow remote experts observing plant development and to assist the on-site operator. Experiment Timeframe The MTF arrived in Antarctica on the 3rd of January 2018. The deployment took around 5 weeks and was finished in early February (Schubert et al., 2018). The winter-over on-site operator remained in Antarctica for the following 10 months until December 2018. In the following chapters “experimental phase” refers to the period from mid-February 2018 to mid-November 2018. The timeline of the experiment phase is shown in Figure 3. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Timeline of the EDEN ISS experiment phase (early 2018 to early 2019).The first plants were sown on February 7th 2018. The winter-over period started with the departure of the last summer crew on February 18th. The first harvest of lettuce and leafy greens was on March 20th. The first cucumber harvest (29th of March) and first tomato harvest (16th of May) took place in the weeks that followed. The coldest temperature of the season was recorded in the morning of the 8th of October 2018 with being −43.5°C. The winter-over period ended with the arrival of the first summer crew on November 2nd. The nominal operation phase of the MTF ended with the final harvest which took place on November 20th. The EDEN ISS winter-over operator departed a few days before Christmas 2018. Crop Species The EDEN ISS project team established a crop selection methodology in order to select crop species for the experiment campaign in Antarctica (Dueck et al., 2016). The focus of the project was on fresh pick-and-eat vegetables. Consequently, the list of cultivated crop species includes various varieties of lettuce and leafy greens accompanied by some fruit crops (e.g., tomato and cucumber). The cultivated crops are organized in the five categories lettuce, leafy greens, herbs, fruit crops and tuber crops. The following crop varieties were cultivated: •Lettuce: Batavia, Expertise, Outredgeous, Waldmann’s Green •Leafy greens: Two varieties of red mustard, swiss chard, arugula, mizuna •Herbs: Basil, chives, parsley •Fruit crops: Red dwarf tomato, orange dwarf tomato, cucumber (parthenocarpic, beit alpha) •Tuber crops: Two varieties of radish, kohlrabi •Miscellaneous crops: Two varieties of indeterminate tomato, two varieties of pepper, cilantro, mint, lemon balm, celery, strawberry. Additional information (e.g., seed supplier) about the cultivated crop species can be found in Supplementary Material. Plant Treatment Most of the crop species were sown in rockwool blocks of 2 × 2 × 4 cm (L × W × H), with the exception being parsley, chives and arugula. Those crops were sown directly in the cultivation trays on mats consisting of recycled cotton fibers. The crops grown in rockwool blocks were first put into a nursery tray for 10–20 days depending on the species. Small amounts of nutrient solution were added manually to this tray in order to keep the rockwool blocks moist. Following the period in the nursery tray, the young plants were moved to the plant cultivation trays for maturation. Some crop species (cucumber, tomato, and pepper) required regular pruning of excess side shoots and leaves. Two different methods for cultivation/harvest were used. Batch cultivation means that the whole plant was harvested when the plant reached a certain age. This technique was used for the lettuce varieties, radishes, and kohlrabi. Spread harvest means that only parts of the plant (leaves, fruits) were harvested allowing the plant to continue growing. All fruit crops, all herbs and all leafy greens were harvested this way. Dates for sowing, transfer, pruning, and harvest events per cultivation tray were tracked continuously. Plant density can be determined from the type of cultivation tray which was used. Table 1 summarizes information regarding the plant treatment for each crop. Upon harvest fresh edible and inedible biomass was measured. The latter was measured separately for roots and stems/leaves. Sometimes plant material was dried using lyophilization in order to determine the dry biomass ratio which is the ratio of the dried biomass weight to the original fresh biomass weight. Drying plant material was limited due to the sizing of the equipment and due to the fact that dried material was required for each crop species. TABLE 1. Summary of plant treatment information.

From each plant cultivation tray, one photo from the top and one photo from the side were taken every day and send to a FTP server where all project partners could access the images. This way the horticulture scientists in the project team could advise the on-site operator on improvements for the cultivation of the crops. An image processing algorithm checked the photos automatically to detect issues with plant development. A multi-wavelength imaging system was setup in two positions to test whether this system can detect plant stress during growth (Zeidler et al., 2019). Environmental Conditions During Plant Cultivation Irrigation High pressure pumps in the FEG feed nutrient solution from the tanks to the plant cultivation trays via a hybrid aeroponic and nutrient film technique (Vrakking et al., 2017; Zabel et al., 2017). The solution was injected into the root zone via misting nozzles and the run-off served as a nutrient film once the roots had developed sufficiently. The irrigation schedule for the plants was a 30 s misting period every 6 min. For the initial germination phase, the on-site operator manually supplied nutrient solution to the germination tray. Two different nutrient solutions were provided to the crops, depending on their classification as either a leafy crop or a fruit crop. The two solutions were automatically mixed together in bulk solution tanks using deionized water and nutrients from concentrated stock solution bottles. The expected (initial) nutrient concentrations in the bulk solutions, based on the recipes developed for the project, can be seen in Table 2. The pH value of the solutions was managed by utilization of acid (1.25% Nitric acid) and base (1% Potassium hydroxide) stock solutions. TABLE 2.

Adjusted values are shown in italic (The adjustment was necessary because a calcium deficit could be observed on the tomato plants, which most likely was the result of a bad K:Ca ratio).Based on the plant development observed throughout the operations phase, and in communication with remote experts in Europe, it was decided part way throughout the mission to adjust the composition for the fruit crop nutrient solution to include more calcium and to reduce the amount of potassium slightly. The concrete values are given in Table 2. There are only two main points of control for the Nutrient Delivery Subsystem (NDS), pH and EC. Both of these operated as expected throughout the first season of plant production. After the initial setup and testing of the growing systems in the beginning 30 days of operation, pH control was excellent. Any deviations from the set point were due to easily diagnosed technical issues (e.g., broken connectors on the acid delivery supply lines) and pH was never beyond a level suitable for plant growth. Tank 1 followed a higher control level than that of tank 2, and this was due to a programmed offset within the control software. Tank 1 averaged pH 6.06 ± 0.18 and tank 2 averaged 5.91 ± 0.12 over the entire growing period. EC monitoring results were similar to that of pH. Control was excellent after the initial 30 day setup period. Each nutrient tank had a different EC set point, and control was tight with 2.21 ± 0.13 mS/cm and 3.49 ± 0.17 mS/cm in tanks 1 and 2, respectively. At no time did EC deviate outside of a range amenable to plant growth and productivity. Also monitored but not controlled was the nutrient solution temperature in the main nutrient tanks. Tank temperature followed that of the well-controlled room temperature and was quite stable with 19.90 ± 0.74°C in tank 1 and 19.97 ± 0.78°C in tank 2. As continuous determination of and control over individual ion concentrations was not possible, it was decided to periodically empty the bulk nutrient solution tanks and start with a new mixture. For tank 1 this procedure was done approximately once every 3 months, whereas for tank 2 the exchange was done about once every 2 months.Illumination A detailed description of the illumination subsystem is provided by Zabel et al. (2016b). Each plant cultivation tray has its own LED lamp which can be independently controlled in terms of light spectrum and light intensity. The LED lamps are of the model LX601 by the Swedish company Heliospectra which were modified with a liquid cooling system instead of the air cooling system. This way the light settings for each tray can be adjusted to the crop species and plant maturation stage. The photoperiod inside the FEG consisted of 15 h of full illumination per day and 1 h of reduced light intensity (50% of nominal intensity) before and after the full illumination period. Consequently, the dark period was 7 h per day. The light spectrum mainly consisted of blue (∼450 nm) and red (∼650 nm) light and small portions of other wavelengths. The light intensity varied between 300 and 600 μmol/(m2*s) at canopy level of a mature plant, depending on crop species and plant age. The following light intensities were measured for the different crops: 1.All four lettuce varieties: 330 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height. 2.Red mustard, swiss chard, mizuna, basil, chives, parsley: 330 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height. 3.Radish, arugula: 600 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height. 4.Tomato, Kohlrabi, pepper: 300–400 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height. 5.Cucumber: > 500 μmol/(m2*s) at top of canopy. Atmosphere The temperature set points inside the FEG were 21°C during the photoperiod and 19°C during the dark period. Relative humidity was set to 65% and CO2 concentration to 1000 ppm. Figures 4–6 show the actual values measured within the FEG throughout the first year of operations. In general it can be seen that the temperature was maintained at the set points, fluctuating between 21 degrees during the photoperiod and 19 degrees during the dark period. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab FEG air temperature during the experimental phase (one data point per minute).FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab FEG relative humidity during the experimental phase (one data point per minute).FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab FEG atmospheric CO2 level during the experiment phase (one data point per minute). Note that the sensor used had an upper limit of 2000 ppm. This value was exceeded frequently due to the presence of the on-site operator.During the Antarctic winter season, at very low external temperatures, the facility failed to maintain temperature during the dark period, resulting in temperature drops down to 16°C. Some off-nominal events with the thermal control subsystem resulted in temperature increases beyond the 21°C set point. Furthermore, a number of measurements are erroneous (showing 0°C) due to communication issues in the command and data handling subsystem. The relative humidity within the FEG showed larger deviations from the set point of 65%, in particular between April and July the relative humidity would go as high as 86% for periods of a few hours. This was the result of issues with the condensate recovery design, which had to be mitigated by adjusting flow rates and coolant temperatures within the thermal control subsystem and fine-tuning the control logic. Following the troubleshooting phase, and implementing countermeasures, the relative humidity control throughout the later phase of the experiment phase was significantly improved. The CO2 concentration within the FEG was almost always higher than the set point of 1000 ppm, due to the fact that the on-site operator frequently (almost every day) worked within the greenhouse, emitting CO2, and there is no CO2 removal system implemented within the facility. Depending on the time (e.g., 1–4 h) spent inside the FEG, the CO2 concentration went up to ∼2000 ppm or even ∼4000 ppm. Normally the plants in the FEG would need around 1 day to consume enough CO2 to bring the concentration back down to the set point of 1000 ppm. A desired maximum ethylene concentration of 15 ppb was defined for the greenhouse, with up to 100 ppb allowed for durations of no more than 30 min. An activated carbon filter was implemented into the atmosphere management subsystem to remove ethylene. However, no sensor was installed to provide measurements of the actual concentration within the facility.",
    "results": "Results Overview The FEG produced a total of around 268 kg of fresh edible biomass. Most of this food was consumed by the 10 person strong winter-over crew. Small amounts were set aside to perform a wide range of measurements (e.g., dry weight ratio, nitrate content). The fruit crops produced by far the most food (105.4 kg) followed by the lettuce (56.4 kg), leafy greens (49.1 kg), tuber crops (26.8 kg), herbs (12.2 kg), and miscellaneous crops (18.4 kg). The evaluation of the inedible biomass was rather complicated, because some of the inedible biomass was harvested wet (e.g., roots and rock wool), some fresh (e.g., radish leaves), and some dry (e.g., withered tomato leaves). Combining all three values into a single figure for all crops was challenging, because the dry biomass ratio was required. In total roughly 11.2 kg of dry inedible biomass (excluding misc. crops) was harvested. The following chapters give a detailed overview of the biomass production of each crop species. Lettuce In total 18 cycles of lettuce cultivation were performed in the experiment phase. Between 11 and 15, depending on the lettuce cultivars, of these cycles are valid for evaluation. The remaining cycles have been excluded from evaluation due to various reasons (e.g., extensive sampling of plant material). The four lettuce varieties were always sown and harvested at the same time and cultivated in trays located in the same rack and with the same environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the biomass production varied greatly among the crop varieties, as can be seen in Table 3. Waldmann’s Green clearly produced the most biomass per tray, followed by Expertise, Outredgeous, and Batavia. Data on the dry weight ratio for edible and inedible biomass can be found in Table 4 and dry inedible biomass production in Table 5. TABLE 3. Lettuce edible fresh weight production values.

There was a decline in biomass harvest roughly in the mid of the season. The productivity of the batches harvested in June and July was less than half of the maximum value. Leafy Greens Five different leafy greens were cultivated. Arugula was harvested in batches, while the other leafy greens (red mustard, swiss chard, and mizuna) were spread harvested. Furthermore, arugula was cultivated with two different light settings. Table 6 shows the biomass production values of all leafy greens. Mizuna and arugula (high light intensity, 600 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height) performed best followed by Swiss chard, both red mustard varieties and arugula (low light intensity, 330 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height) which all had a similar output. Due to the batch harvesting of arugula and the availability of two trays for simultaneous cultivation 17 cycles are available for evaluation. For the other leafy greens, only between 1 and 3 cycles, depending on the cultivar, of data are available.

Herbs Basil, chives, and parsley were cultivated during the experiment phase. All herbs were spread harvested. Parsley and chives were grown for almost the complete duration of the experiment phase (266 out of 286 days). Basil had to be removed from the trays and sown anew regularly, because the plants grew rapidly, reaching up to the LED lamps after several weeks. Four cycles of basil were grown of which two are suitable for data evaluation. The other two had to be excluded because the first cycle used an inappropriate growing procedure and the last cycle was too short. The three herbs have a similar production rate of edible biomass with parsley and basil being slightly ahead of chives. The biomass production data for the herbs can be found in Table 7.

Fruit Crops Fruit crops produced the most edible biomass during the experiment phase. Especially the cucumber showed an exceptional productivity of more than 100 g/(tray∗d) and consequently contributed the most edible biomass of all cultivated crop species. The two dwarf tomato varieties show a similar productivity, with the orange tomato being slightly lower than the red one. The tomato plants were grown in a single cycle lasting the full experimental phase, while the cucumber plants were grown in two cycles.

    "discussion": "Discussion During the 286-day operational phase in 2018 the EDEN ISS MTF produced 268 kg of fresh edible biomass, which is a good result for the first year of operation. The production rate was 21.44 kg/m2. This results in a time normalized production rate of 0.075 kg/(m2*d). The pepper plants did only produce small amounts of fruit in the 2018 EDEN ISS season, but took up 11% of the cultivation area. When correcting the overall production of EDEN ISS by removing the pepper plants from the calculation the edible fresh biomass production rate increases to 0.089 kg/(m2*d). The South Pole Food Growth Chamber (SPFGC), an indoor plant cultivation room at the American South Pole Station (Patterson et al., 2008), had a production rate of 0.130 kg/(m2*d) in 2006 (Patterson et al., 2012). The SPGFC mainly produced lettuce (32% of total fresh edible biomass) and cucumber (41%) and only small amounts of herbs (6%), tomato (4%), and other crops (17%). Whereas the distribution in EDEN ISS in 2018 was 21% lettuce, 18% leafy greens, 25% cucumber, 5% herbs, 14% tomato, 10% tuber vegetables and 7% other crops. Since cucumber have the highest production rate per unit area and time, the higher ratio of cucumber in the SPFGC harvest can explain the better overall production rate of fresh edible biomass compared to EDEN ISS to some degree. Plant cultivation experiments have been conducted by an EDEN ISS project partner in advance of the Antarctic experimental campaign (Meinen et al., 2018). When comparing the results from Antarctica with the experiments conducted in plant growth chambers in Europe, the yield per unit time and cultivation area of lettuce was higher in Antarctica than in the experiments in Europe. The yield of the red mustard frizzy lizzy, Swiss chard, parsley and chives was better in the plant growth chambers in Europe than in Antarctica, but the plant density in those experiments was much higher. The yield of lettuce was better than (Richards et al., 2004b; Edney et al., 2006) or equal to (Richards et al., 2004a) some other experiments, but only half as good as the values achieved by the BPC (Wheeler et al., 2008). No reliable reference data could be found for the leafy greens mizuna and the red mustard red giant. This is also the issue with the cultivated herbs basil, parsley and chives for which the only comparison that could be made was with the preparatory experiments of the project (Meinen et al., 2018). The dwarf tomato yield was basically equal to experiments with similar cultivars (Spencer et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019), but smaller compared to the BPC results (Wheeler et al., 2008) which were most likely done with normal sized tomato crops. The yield of the EDEN ISS cucumber cultivation was better compared to the experiments with this crop in Lunar Palace 1 (Fu et al., 2016). The comparisons between the results from the experiment campaign in Antarctica in 2018 to other experiments are summarized in Table 10. TABLE 10.

The FAOSTAT database, maintained by the United Nations Food Agriculture Organization, is a collection of yield values for a variety of commercially grown crops. This database can be filtered by crops and countries or regions of interest. Three crop categories similar to the EDEN ISS are found in the database: cucumbers/gherkins, tomatoes and lettuce/chicory. When looking on the FAOSTAT data for 2017 and setting the country to the Netherlands, the most effective producer of vegetables, one gets a yearly production of 68.97, 50.84, and 3.11 kg/m2 for cucumbers/gherkins, tomatoes and lettuce/chicory, respectively. The EDEN ISS values for the 2018 season converted to a yearly production are 122.99 kg/m2 cucumbers, 19.70 kg/m2 tomatoes and 36.11 kg/m2 lettuce. When comparing the values EDEN ISS production is much higher for cucumbers and lettuce, but only around 40% for tomatoes. The difference in tomato production is most likely caused by the decision to grow less-effective dwarf tomato cultivars instead of normal sized high-productive tomatoes, while the much higher yield of cucumbers and lettuce can be explained by the absence of seasonal temperature and illumination changes which affect conventional greenhouse farming.",

Copyright notice ID: 7264257 PMID: 32528506 Abstract The EDEN ISS greenhouse is a space-analog test facility near the German Neumayer III station in Antarctica. The facility is part of the project of the same name and was designed and built starting from March 2015 and eventually deployed in Antarctica in January 2018. The nominal operation of the greenhouse started on February 7th and continued until the 20th of November. The purpose of the facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. Research on food quality and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human factors and horticultural sciences was conducted. Part of the latter is the determination of the biomass production of the different crops. The data on this topic is presented in this paper. During the first season 26 different crops were grown on the 12.5 m2 cultivation area of the greenhouse. A large number of crops were grown continuously throughout the 9 months of operation, but there were also crops that were only grown a few times for test purposes. The focus of this season was on growing lettuce, leafy greens and fresh vegetables. In total more than 268 kg of edible biomass was produced by the EDEN ISS greenhouse facility in 2018. Most of the harvest was cucumbers (67 kg), lettuces (56 kg), leafy greens (49 kg), and tomatoes (50 kg) complemented with smaller amounts of herbs (12 kg), radish (8 kg), and kohlrabi (19 kg). The environmental set points for the crops were 330–600 μmol/(m2*s) LED light, 21°C, ∼65% relative humidity, 1000 ppm and the photoperiod was 17 h per day. The overall yearly productivity of the EDEN ISS greenhouse in 2018 was 27.4 kg/m2, which is equal to 0.075 kg/(m2*d). This paper shows in detail the data on edible and inedible biomass production of each crop grown in the EDEN ISS greenhouse in Antarctica during the 2018 season. Keywords: bio-regenerative life support system (BLSS), plant cultivation chamber, space plant growth facility, space food and nutrition, space analog studies, controlled environment agriculture (CEA)Introduction Food production during human space missions to and on Moon and Mars is a necessary step to reduce resupply mass from Earth and thus long-term mission costs. Growing plants for food production also offers the advantages of producing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as well as the recycling of water. Because of these advantages, experiments in growing plants in space began as early as the first manned space stations and continue to the present day (Zabel et al., 2016a). Several research teams conducted experiments in cultivating plants in a closed controlled environment on Earth for the application in future space missions in the past (Wheeler, 2017). Notable are NASA’s Biomass Production Chamber (Wheeler et al., 2003; Dreschel et al., 2018), the Russian BIOS facilities (Gitelson et al., 2003), the Japanese Closed Ecology Experimental Facility (Nitta, 2005) and the Chinese Lunar Palace 1 (Fu et al., 2016). The EDEN ISS project is the newest space greenhouse analog project to test subsystems, technologies, operation procedures, plant health monitoring devices and plant cultivation for future space missions. The EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility (MTF) (Figure 1) was setup in Antarctica to achieve these goals. This paper presents detailed values on food production (edible biomass) and inedible biomass production of the vegetable crops cultivated in the experimental phase in 2018. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab The EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility in Antarctica around 400 m south of the German Neumayer Station III.The difference of the EDEN ISS MTF to the other facilities is its unique location. The MTF is positioned in the vicinity of the German Neumayer Station III in Antarctica. This continent offers several conditions which are favorable for space analog test campaigns (Bubenheim et al., 1994). While most of the other facilities were built to conduct research on humans living in a closed loop life support system, EDEN ISS focuses on cultivating plants in controlled conditions, testing the necessary hardware and investigating microbiology, food quality and safety aspects. Furthermore, most of the facilities mentioned earlier were built and operated in the 1980s–2000s and are no longer available, except for Lunar Palace 1 which was built only a few years ago and is still in operation. EDEN ISS also uses technologies which were not available in the past (e.g., LED lighting for plant cultivation). The novel aspect of the EDEN ISS project is its approach to work with a compromise climate in which all crops are grown simultaneously. This is more realistic for near-term space greenhouses as compared to studies were each crop has its own optimized climate. Despite not having the optimal climate for each crop the food production of the MTF in the 2018 season was higher than expected. In 2018, for the first time a comprehensive set of measurements were performed in an analog space greenhouse. These measurements encompass the biomass production data presented in this paper, but also data on the microbial environment inside the greenhouse, the quality and safety of the produced food, the resources (e.g., carbon dioxide, nutrients, consumables) necessary to grow the crops, the amount of electrical energy and crewtime required and the acceptance of the food to the station crew. The biomass production dataset presented in this paper can be used to improve simulation models for space greenhouses. It can also be used for cultivar selection, because the dataset includes values on different cultivars (e.g., for lettuce and tomato) which is helpful to assess which cultivar should be grown in the next space greenhouse. The data is also a valuable contribution to the recently developed Crop Readiness Level evaluation method (Romeyn et al., 2019) for crop candidates for space greenhouses.Materials and Methods EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility Infrastructure The EDEN ISS MTF is located in the immediate vicinity of the Neumayer III Station which is operated by the German Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research. The MTF was designed and built as an experimental facility for plant cultivation systems, allowing the test of essential technologies and production procedures for future long-duration human space missions (Zabel et al., 2015). Detailed system analysis was conducted by the consortium partners resulting in a solid design (Bamsey et al., 2014, 2016; Zabel et al., 2016b), including a complete risk assessment (Santos et al., 2016). The MTF consists of two customized 20 foot high cube shipping containers, which are placed on top of a raised platform located ∼400 m south of Neumayer III. The research facility can be subdivided into three distinct sections: •Airlock/Cold-Porch (Blue section in Figure 2): A small room providing storage and a small air buffer to limit the entry of cold air when the main access door of the facility is used. This area is used for changing clothes. Furthermore, the main fresh water tank and the waste water tank are both located in the subfloor space of this section. •Service Section (Red section in Figure 2): This section houses the primary control, atmosphere management, thermal control, power control and nutrient delivery systems of the MTF (Vrakking et al., 2017). Additionally, this section provides a working table including sink, trash bins, and storage for tools and consumables. In addition this section houses an independent rack-like plant cultivation system as part of the plant growth demonstrator for future deployment onboard the ISS (Boscheri et al., 2016, 2017). •Future Exploration Greenhouse (FEG) (Green section in Figure 2): The main plant cultivation space of the MTF which includes multi-level plant growth racks operating in a controlled environment. The FEG is used to study plant cultivation and the related technologies for future planetary habitats (Zabel et al., 2017). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Schematic top-view of the MTF. The blue section indicates the cold porch. The red area is called service section and houses a work desk and almost all greenhouse subsystems. The green section is the main plant cultivation space, called the FEG.The technologies required to cultivate plants in a controlled environment are arranged in six different subsystems, which are briefly described in the following. Detailed information about the subsystems can be found in Zabel et al. (2017) and Vrakking et al. (2017). 1)The nutrient delivery subsystem adjusts the irrigation water’s pH and EC value. Depending on the plant type (leafy or fruit-building crop), the mixing computer provides a dedicated nutrient solution that is delivered directly to the roots. Eight high-pressure pumps spray a fine nutrient mist inside the root compartment of each plant tray. 2)The atmosphere management subsystem regulates the temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration within the FEG. Furthermore, the air flow is filtered (particle filter, HEPA, and activated carbon filter) and the humidity condensate water is recovered and fed back to the fresh water tank. 3)The thermal control subsystem is used to remove excess heat from the MTF and to provide a cool fluid for condensation of the humidity produced by the plants. 4)The illumination control subsystem consists of 42 fluid-cooled LED fixtures integrated into the FEG. The light spectrum can freely be composed of red, blue, far-red, and white for each plant tray. 5)The power distribution subsystem provides electrical energy to all subsystems of the MTF. The electrical energy is generated in the Neumayer Station III and transmitted to the MTF. 6)The control and data handling subsystem consists of a set of independent programmable logic controllers which receive information from a wide range of sensors. Based on this information and defined program logics this subsystem controls all functions of the MTF. The control and data handling subsystem sends system telemetry to the mission control center in Bremen, Germany. Furthermore, every day a set of images taken from fixed positions inside the FEG is sent to the mission control center to allow remote experts observing plant development and to assist the on-site operator. Experiment Timeframe The MTF arrived in Antarctica on the 3rd of January 2018. The deployment took around 5 weeks and was finished in early February (Schubert et al., 2018). The winter-over on-site operator remained in Antarctica for the following 10 months until December 2018. In the following chapters “experimental phase” refers to the period from mid-February 2018 to mid-November 2018. The timeline of the experiment phase is shown in Figure 3. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Timeline of the EDEN ISS experiment phase (early 2018 to early 2019).The first plants were sown on February 7th 2018. The winter-over period started with the departure of the last summer crew on February 18th. The first harvest of lettuce and leafy greens was on March 20th. The first cucumber harvest (29th of March) and first tomato harvest (16th of May) took place in the weeks that followed. The coldest temperature of the season was recorded in the morning of the 8th of October 2018 with being −43.5°C. The winter-over period ended with the arrival of the first summer crew on November 2nd. The nominal operation phase of the MTF ended with the final harvest which took place on November 20th. The EDEN ISS winter-over operator departed a few days before Christmas 2018.Crop Species The EDEN ISS project team established a crop selection methodology in order to select crop species for the experiment campaign in Antarctica (Dueck et al., 2016). The focus of the project was on fresh pick-and-eat vegetables. Consequently, the list of cultivated crop species includes various varieties of lettuce and leafy greens accompanied by some fruit crops (e.g., tomato and cucumber). The cultivated crops are organized in the five categories lettuce, leafy greens, herbs, fruit crops and tuber crops. The following crop varieties were cultivated: •Lettuce: Batavia, Expertise, Outredgeous, Waldmann’s Green •Leafy greens: Two varieties of red mustard, swiss chard, arugula, mizuna •Herbs: Basil, chives, parsley •Fruit crops: Red dwarf tomato, orange dwarf tomato, cucumber (parthenocarpic, beit alpha) •Tuber crops: Two varieties of radish, kohlrabi •Miscellaneous crops: Two varieties of indeterminate tomato, two varieties of pepper, cilantro, mint, lemon balm, celery, strawberry. Additional information (e.g., seed supplier) about the cultivated crop species can be found in Supplementary Material.Plant Treatment Most of the crop species were sown in rockwool blocks of 2 × 2 × 4 cm (L × W × H), with the exception being parsley, chives and arugula. Those crops were sown directly in the cultivation trays on mats consisting of recycled cotton fibers. The crops grown in rockwool blocks were first put into a nursery tray for 10–20 days depending on the species. Small amounts of nutrient solution were added manually to this tray in order to keep the rockwool blocks moist. Following the period in the nursery tray, the young plants were moved to the plant cultivation trays for maturation. Some crop species (cucumber, tomato, and pepper) required regular pruning of excess side shoots and leaves. Two different methods for cultivation/harvest were used. Batch cultivation means that the whole plant was harvested when the plant reached a certain age. This technique was used for the lettuce varieties, radishes, and kohlrabi. Spread harvest means that only parts of the plant (leaves, fruits) were harvested allowing the plant to continue growing. All fruit crops, all herbs and all leafy greens were harvested this way. Dates for sowing, transfer, pruning, and harvest events per cultivation tray were tracked continuously. Plant density can be determined from the type of cultivation tray which was used. Table 1 summarizes information regarding the plant treatment for each crop. Upon harvest fresh edible and inedible biomass was measured. The latter was measured separately for roots and stems/leaves. Sometimes plant material was dried using lyophilization in order to determine the dry biomass ratio which is the ratio of the dried biomass weight to the original fresh biomass weight. Drying plant material was limited due to the sizing of the equipment and due to the fact that dried material was required for each crop species. TABLE 1. Summary of plant treatment information.

From each plant cultivation tray, one photo from the top and one photo from the side were taken every day and send to a FTP server where all project partners could access the images. This way the horticulture scientists in the project team could advise the on-site operator on improvements for the cultivation of the crops. An image processing algorithm checked the photos automatically to detect issues with plant development. A multi-wavelength imaging system was setup in two positions to test whether this system can detect plant stress during growth (Zeidler et al., 2019).Environmental Conditions During Plant Cultivation Irrigation High pressure pumps in the FEG feed nutrient solution from the tanks to the plant cultivation trays via a hybrid aeroponic and nutrient film technique (Vrakking et al., 2017; Zabel et al., 2017). The solution was injected into the root zone via misting nozzles and the run-off served as a nutrient film once the roots had developed sufficiently. The irrigation schedule for the plants was a 30 s misting period every 6 min. For the initial germination phase, the on-site operator manually supplied nutrient solution to the germination tray. Two different nutrient solutions were provided to the crops, depending on their classification as either a leafy crop or a fruit crop. The two solutions were automatically mixed together in bulk solution tanks using deionized water and nutrients from concentrated stock solution bottles. The expected (initial) nutrient concentrations in the bulk solutions, based on the recipes developed for the project, can be seen in Table 2. The pH value of the solutions was managed by utilization of acid (1.25% Nitric acid) and base (1% Potassium hydroxide) stock solutions. TABLE 2. Nutrient concentration in 100 L bulk solution in NDS tanks during the experiment phase.

Adjusted values are shown in italic (The adjustment was necessary because a calcium deficit could be observed on the tomato plants, which most likely was the result of a bad K:Ca ratio).Based on the plant development observed throughout the operations phase, and in communication with remote experts in Europe, it was decided part way throughout the mission to adjust the composition for the fruit crop nutrient solution to include more calcium and to reduce the amount of potassium slightly. The concrete values are given in Table 2. There are only two main points of control for the Nutrient Delivery Subsystem (NDS), pH and EC. Both of these operated as expected throughout the first season of plant production. After the initial setup and testing of the growing systems in the beginning 30 days of operation, pH control was excellent. Any deviations from the set point were due to easily diagnosed technical issues (e.g., broken connectors on the acid delivery supply lines) and pH was never beyond a level suitable for plant growth. Tank 1 followed a higher control level than that of tank 2, and this was due to a programmed offset within the control software. Tank 1 averaged pH 6.06 ± 0.18 and tank 2 averaged 5.91 ± 0.12 over the entire growing period. EC monitoring results were similar to that of pH. Control was excellent after the initial 30 day setup period. Each nutrient tank had a different EC set point, and control was tight with 2.21 ± 0.13 mS/cm and 3.49 ± 0.17 mS/cm in tanks 1 and 2, respectively. At no time did EC deviate outside of a range amenable to plant growth and productivity. Also monitored but not controlled was the nutrient solution temperature in the main nutrient tanks. Tank temperature followed that of the well-controlled room temperature and was quite stable with 19.90 ± 0.74°C in tank 1 and 19.97 ± 0.78°C in tank 2. As continuous determination of and control over individual ion concentrations was not possible, it was decided to periodically empty the bulk nutrient solution tanks and start with a new mixture. For tank 1 this procedure was done approximately once every 3 months, whereas for tank 2 the exchange was done about once every 2 months.Illumination A detailed description of the illumination subsystem is provided by Zabel et al. (2016b). Each plant cultivation tray has its own LED lamp which can be independently controlled in terms of light spectrum and light intensity. The LED lamps are of the model LX601 by the Swedish company Heliospectra which were modified with a liquid cooling system instead of the air cooling system. This way the light settings for each tray can be adjusted to the crop species and plant maturation stage. The photoperiod inside the FEG consisted of 15 h of full illumination per day and 1 h of reduced light intensity (50% of nominal intensity) before and after the full illumination period. Consequently, the dark period was 7 h per day. The light spectrum mainly consisted of blue (∼450 nm) and red (∼650 nm) light and small portions of other wavelengths. The light intensity varied between 300 and 600 μmol/(m2*s) at canopy level of a mature plant, depending on crop species and plant age. The following light intensities were measured for the different crops: 1.All four lettuce varieties: 330 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height. 2.Red mustard, swiss chard, mizuna, basil, chives, parsley: 330 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height. 3.Radish, arugula: 600 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height. 4.Tomato, Kohlrabi, pepper: 300–400 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height. 5.Cucumber: > 500 μmol/(m2*s) at top of canopy. Atmosphere The temperature set points inside the FEG were 21°C during the photoperiod and 19°C during the dark period. Relative humidity was set to 65% and CO2 concentration to 1000 ppm. Figures 4–6 show the actual values measured within the FEG throughout the first year of operations. In general it can be seen that the temperature was maintained at the set points, fluctuating between 21 degrees during the photoperiod and 19 degrees during the dark period. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab FEG air temperature during the experimental phase (one data point per minute).FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab FEG relative humidity during the experimental phase (one data point per minute).FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab FEG atmospheric CO2 level during the experiment phase (one data point per minute). Note that the sensor used had an upper limit of 2000 ppm. This value was exceeded frequently due to the presence of the on-site operator.During the Antarctic winter season, at very low external temperatures, the facility failed to maintain temperature during the dark period, resulting in temperature drops down to 16°C. Some off-nominal events with the thermal control subsystem resulted in temperature increases beyond the 21°C set point. Furthermore, a number of measurements are erroneous (showing 0°C) due to communication issues in the command and data handling subsystem. The relative humidity within the FEG showed larger deviations from the set point of 65%, in particular between April and July the relative humidity would go as high as 86% for periods of a few hours. This was the result of issues with the condensate recovery design, which had to be mitigated by adjusting flow rates and coolant temperatures within the thermal control subsystem and fine-tuning the control logic. Following the troubleshooting phase, and implementing countermeasures, the relative humidity control throughout the later phase of the experiment phase was significantly improved. The CO2 concentration within the FEG was almost always higher than the set point of 1000 ppm, due to the fact that the on-site operator frequently (almost every day) worked within the greenhouse, emitting CO2, and there is no CO2 removal system implemented within the facility. Depending on the time (e.g., 1–4 h) spent inside the FEG, the CO2 concentration went up to ∼2000 ppm or even ∼4000 ppm. Normally the plants in the FEG would need around 1 day to consume enough CO2 to bring the concentration back down to the set point of 1000 ppm. A desired maximum ethylene concentration of 15 ppb was defined for the greenhouse, with up to 100 ppb allowed for durations of no more than 30 min. An activated carbon filter was implemented into the atmosphere management subsystem to remove ethylene. However, no sensor was installed to provide measurements of the actual concentration within the facility.Results Overview The FEG produced a total of around 268 kg of fresh edible biomass. Most of this food was consumed by the 10 person strong winter-over crew. Small amounts were set aside to perform a wide range of measurements (e.g., dry weight ratio, nitrate content). The fruit crops produced by far the most food (105.4 kg) followed by the lettuce (56.4 kg), leafy greens (49.1 kg), tuber crops (26.8 kg), herbs (12.2 kg), and miscellaneous crops (18.4 kg). The evaluation of the inedible biomass was rather complicated, because some of the inedible biomass was harvested wet (e.g., roots and rock wool), some fresh (e.g., radish leaves), and some dry (e.g., withered tomato leaves). Combining all three values into a single figure for all crops was challenging, because the dry biomass ratio was required. In total roughly 11.2 kg of dry inedible biomass (excluding misc. crops) was harvested. The following chapters give a detailed overview of the biomass production of each crop species.Lettuce In total 18 cycles of lettuce cultivation were performed in the experiment phase. Between 11 and 15, depending on the lettuce cultivars, of these cycles are valid for evaluation. The remaining cycles have been excluded from evaluation due to various reasons (e.g., extensive sampling of plant material). The four lettuce varieties were always sown and harvested at the same time and cultivated in trays located in the same rack and with the same environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the biomass production varied greatly among the crop varieties, as can be seen in Table 3. Waldmann’s Green clearly produced the most biomass per tray, followed by Expertise, Outredgeous, and Batavia. Data on the dry weight ratio for edible and inedible biomass can be found in Table 4 and dry inedible biomass production in Table 5. TABLE 3. Lettuce edible fresh weight production values.

There was a decline in biomass harvest roughly in the mid of the season. The productivity of the batches harvested in June and July was less than half of the maximum value.Leafy Greens Five different leafy greens were cultivated. Arugula was harvested in batches, while the other leafy greens (red mustard, swiss chard, and mizuna) were spread harvested. Furthermore, arugula was cultivated with two different light settings. Table 6 shows the biomass production values of all leafy greens. Mizuna and arugula (high light intensity, 600 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height) performed best followed by Swiss chard, both red mustard varieties and arugula (low light intensity, 330 μmol/(m2*s) at 16 cm height) which all had a similar output. Due to the batch harvesting of arugula and the availability of two trays for simultaneous cultivation 17 cycles are available for evaluation. For the other leafy greens, only between 1 and 3 cycles, depending on the cultivar, of data are available. Data on the dry weight ratio for edible and inedible biomass can be found in Table 4 and dry inedible biomass production in Table 5. TABLE 6. Leafy greens edible fresh weight production values.

All herbs were spread harvested. Parsley and chives were grown for almost the complete duration of the experiment phase (266 out of 286 days). Basil had to be removed from the trays and sown anew regularly, because the plants grew rapidly, reaching up to the LED lamps after several weeks. Four cycles of basil were grown of which two are suitable for data evaluation. The other two had to be excluded because the first cycle used an inappropriate growing procedure and the last cycle was too short. The three herbs have a similar production rate of edible biomass with parsley and basil being slightly ahead of chives. The biomass production data for the herbs can be found in Table 7.

Especially the cucumber showed an exceptional productivity of more than 100 g/(tray∗d) and consequently contributed the most edible biomass of all cultivated crop species. The two dwarf tomato varieties show a similar productivity, with the orange tomato being slightly lower than the red one. The tomato plants were grown in a single cycle lasting the full experimental phase, while the cucumber plants were grown in two cycles. The biomass production data for the fruit crops can be found in Table 8.

Of those 20 batches, 19 were suitable for evaluation. One batch had to be excluded from evaluation due to extensive sampling of plant material for microbial and matter analyses (e.g., nitrate content, antioxidants). Furthermore, seven batches of kohlrabi were grown. Kohlrabi produced more biomass per cultivation area and time normalized than radish.

The production rate was 21.44 kg/m2. This results in a time normalized production rate of 0.075 kg/(m2*d). The pepper plants did only produce small amounts of fruit in the 2018 EDEN ISS season, but took up 11% of the cultivation area. When correcting the overall production of EDEN ISS by removing the pepper plants from the calculation the edible fresh biomass production rate increases to 0.089 kg/(m2*d). The South Pole Food Growth Chamber (SPFGC), an indoor plant cultivation room at the American South Pole Station (Patterson et al., 2008), had a production rate of 0.130 kg/(m2*d) in 2006 (Patterson et al., 2012). The SPGFC mainly produced lettuce (32% of total fresh edible biomass) and cucumber (41%) and only small amounts of herbs (6%), tomato (4%), and other crops (17%). Whereas the distribution in EDEN ISS in 2018 was 21% lettuce, 18% leafy greens, 25% cucumber, 5% herbs, 14% tomato, 10% tuber vegetables and 7% other crops. Since cucumber have the highest production rate per unit area and time, the higher ratio of cucumber in the SPFGC harvest can explain the better overall production rate of fresh edible biomass compared to EDEN ISS to some degree. Plant cultivation experiments have been conducted by an EDEN ISS project partner in advance of the Antarctic experimental campaign (Meinen et al., 2018). When comparing the results from Antarctica with the experiments conducted in plant growth chambers in Europe, the yield per unit time and cultivation area of lettuce was higher in Antarctica than in the experiments in Europe. The yield of the red mustard frizzy lizzy, Swiss chard, parsley and chives was better in the plant growth chambers in Europe than in Antarctica, but the plant density in those experiments was much higher. The yield of lettuce was better than (Richards et al., 2004b; Edney et al., 2006) or equal to (Richards et al., 2004a) some other experiments, but only half as good as the values achieved by the BPC (Wheeler et al., 2008). No reliable reference data could be found for the leafy greens mizuna and the red mustard red giant. This is also the issue with the cultivated herbs basil, parsley and chives for which the only comparison that could be made was with the preparatory experiments of the project (Meinen et al., 2018). The dwarf tomato yield was basically equal to experiments with similar cultivars (Spencer et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019), but smaller compared to the BPC results (Wheeler et al., 2008) which were most likely done with normal sized tomato crops. The yield of the EDEN ISS cucumber cultivation was better compared to the experiments with this crop in Lunar Palace 1 (Fu et al., 2016). The comparisons between the results from the experiment campaign in Antarctica in 2018 to other experiments are summarized in Table 10. TABLE 10.

This database can be filtered by crops and countries or regions of interest. Three crop categories similar to the EDEN ISS are found in the database: cucumbers/gherkins, tomatoes and lettuce/chicory. When looking on the FAOSTAT data for 2017 and setting the country to the Netherlands, the most effective producer of vegetables, one gets a yearly production of 68.97, 50.84, and 3.11 kg/m2 for cucumbers/gherkins, tomatoes and lettuce/chicory, respectively. The EDEN ISS values for the 2018 season converted to a yearly production are 122.99 kg/m2 cucumbers, 19.70 kg/m2 tomatoes and 36.11 kg/m2 lettuce. When comparing the values EDEN ISS production is much higher for cucumbers and lettuce, but only around 40% for tomatoes. The difference in tomato production is most likely caused by the decision to grow less-effective dwarf tomato cultivars instead of normal sized high-productive tomatoes, while the much higher yield of cucumbers and lettuce can be explained by the absence of seasonal temperature and illumination changes which affect conventional greenhouse farming.Summary During the 9 month long experiment campaign of the international EDEN ISS space greenhouse analog project in Antarctica a wide range of vegetables were cultivated. These crop species are also candidates for greenhouses on future human spaceflight missions. The plants were cultivated in a closed, controlled environment using an aeroponic system and LED illumination. The on-site operator in 2018 harvested more than 268 kg of fresh food from the 12.5 m2 cultivation area of the EDEN ISS greenhouse. A description of the cultivation conditions is part of this paper. Detailed production values (edible and inedible biomass) for each crop species are shown in this paper as well as dry biomass ratios. Comparisons of the EDEN ISS yield from 2018 to other experiments are made. The EDEN ISS MTF is the newest and most state-of-the-art space greenhouse analog experiment currently ongoing. The dataset presented in this paper can be of value to compare future experiments to and also for simulation and modeling efforts of space greenhouses. Furthermore, this first EDEN ISS biomass production data set states the beginning of a series of experimental seasons in Antarctica, which will continuously be recorded and published over the next years. One unique aspect of this research was the cultivation of all crops together in the same space under the same conditions. Although, this means that the conditions were not optimal for each cultivar, this is closer to how crop cultivation is going to be done in near-term space greenhouses, in which environmentally separated compartments for each crop are too costly and technically complex. This is in opposition to most laboratory experiments, in which crops are grown under optimal conditions.Data Availability Statement The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.Author Contributions PZ was the on-site operator of the EDEN ISS greenhouse in Antarctica during the experiment campaign, which means he was responsible for the plant cultivation and measurements, also worked on the materials and method part of the manuscript (section Materials and Methods), and on the data evaluation (section Results and Discussion).

    "abstract": "Abstract The observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Further, spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. SPIRAL1 is a skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In this study, both sku5 and spr1 mutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereas sku5 showed considerably more than its WS wild-type. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The spr1 response is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the sku5 responses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation. Keywords: spaceflight, root, skewing, transcriptomics, abiotic stress, acclimation, physiological adaptation",
    "introduction": "Introduction Spaceflight studies offer unique insights into plant biological processes, and enable the exploration of the relationships between root morphology, gene expression and the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The developmental patterns of plant organs are continuously altered through perception of the environment, signal integration, and response to environmental stimuli. A diversity of tropic gradients influence the path of growth in roots by initiating localized, asymmetrical changes in cell elongation. These changes are primarily brought about through hormonal interactions and subsequent remodeling of cell physiology (Roy and Bassham, 2014; Vandenbrink et al., 2014; Schultz et al., 2017). Root skewing and waving are phenomena in which root growth deviates from a gravity vector throughout its development, and which vary between the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) ecotypes Columbia (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (WS) (Rutherford and Masson, 1996; Roy and Bassham, 2014; Schultz et al., 2017). Although once thought to be a gravity-dependent growth behavior (Oliva and Dunand, 2007), skewing occurs in the microgravity of spaceflight (Paul et al., 2012a). This suggests that skewing is independent of both the tropic force of gravity and the gravity-induced contact forces between roots and growth media (Millar et al., 2011; Paul et al., 2012a, 2013; Nakashima et al., 2014). Therefore, the spaceflight environment provides a unique and relevant context in which to study genes associated with skewing phenotypes. Plants grown in the spaceflight environment exhibit complex and unique gene expression patterns (e.g., Paul et al., 2005; Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Correll et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). The predominant feature of the spaceflight environment is microgravity. The lack of gravity has a direct effect on plant cells and signal transduction; this direct effect represents a novel environment for plants, and any terrestrial organism, and appears to be generally perceived as stressful. In addition, microgravity imposes secondary environmental stresses due to the disruption of fluid movement, and any processes influenced by convection, such as gas exchange and temperature redistribution. Combinatorial stresses induce changes in gene expression and tolerance that are not fully recapitulated by exposure to the individual stressors (e.g., Ramegowda and Senthil-Kumar, 2015; Suzuki et al., 2016). Thus it is important to think of the spaceflight environment as more complex than microgravity alone. Several classes of stress response genes have been identified as consistently involved in the response to spaceflight across ecotypes of Arabidopsis via analyses of gene expression. Heat shock genes are often induced by spaceflight (Paul et al., 2005, 2012b; Salmi and Roux, 2008; Shagimardanova et al., 2010; Zupanska et al., 2013, 2017, 2019; Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and scavenging processes are also common in the spaceflight response, though ROS-associated genes have been observed as both up- and downregulated in spaceflight (Shagimardanova et al., 2010; Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Kwon et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). Some stress gene expression changes are also associated with spaceflight-induced changes in the Arabidopsis methylome (Zhou et al., 2019). Cell wall remodeling processes are enriched in spaceflight gene expression datasets (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Correll et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017). Cell wall remodeling genes, typically associated with biotic stress and pathogen defense pathways, also contribute to spaceflight acclimation (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Correll et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2019). Spaceflight also affects abundances of proteins of defense pathways and cell wall remodeling (Mazars et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015). However, the particular genetic pathways activated and repressed in spaceflight vary among ecotypes of Arabidopsis, demonstrating that there are significant genotypic contributions to spaceflight physiological adaptation (Paul et al., 2017; Beisel et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2019). Mutations in genes associated with stress response and signaling pathways can significantly alter the differential gene expression profiles of spaceflight physiological adaptation. Single gene mutations in heat shock transcription factors, gravity perception genes, and light signaling genes in Arabidopsis seedlings and cultures exhibit altered spaceflight responses (Paul et al., 2017; Zupanska et al., 2017, 2019). Therefore, we sought to understand better the relationships among spaceflight responses, root morphology, and spaceflight adaptation by exploring the spaceflight responses of two single gene skewing-related mutant lines: spiral1 and sku5. Spiral1 (Spr1) is a skewing-related gene that contributes to the process of anisotropic cell expansion by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. The spr1 mutation results in axial rotation of cell files throughout the plant, which manifests in the roots as skewing to the left when viewed, according to convention, from beneath their growth medium (Rutherford and Masson, 1996; Furutani et al., 2000; Nakajima et al., 2004; Sedbrook et al., 2004; Galva et al., 2014). The SPR1 protein is a microtubule plus-end tracking protein that localizes to the plus ends of actively polymerizing cortical microtubules, dissociating upon a shift to microtubule depolymerization (Sedbrook et al., 2004; Galva et al., 2014). This association is mediated by two similar motifs on the N- and C-termini of the protein, which allow SPR1 to act as an intermolecular linker (Nakajima et al., 2004; Sedbrook et al., 2004; Galva et al., 2014). The protein END-BINDING 1B (EB1b) co-localizes with SPR1 at the microtubule plus-end, where each protein interacts with the other as well as tubulin subunits (Galva et al., 2014). This creates the dual effects of SPR1 and EB1b increasing microtubule stability and polymerization rate, while also enhancing the rescue rate of depolymerizing microtubules (Galva et al., 2014). However, the spr1 mutation also leads to a decreased rate of shrinkage among depolymerizing microtubules (Galva et al., 2014). The regulation of microtubule dynamics is critical to many environmental responses, such as in salt stress where 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of SPR1 is known to occur in conjunction with microtubule reorganization to enable stress acclimation (Shoji et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2016). In addition to these micro-scale changes, the skewing phenotype of spr1 is significantly enhanced by cold treatment, and suppressed by both salt and heat stresses (Furutani et al., 2000; Sedbrook et al., 2004). This connects SPR1 to processes regulating morphology in both optimal and stressful environments. Sku5 is a skewing-associated gene that encodes a protein in the SKU5-SIMILAR (SKS) family, which is related to known Arabidopsis copper oxidases, but which contains only one Type-II copper-coordinating domain of unknown specificity (Sedbrook et al., 2002). The sku5 mutant was originally noted for the rightward skewing it exhibits on vertically oriented growth media, which manifests in both WS and Col-0 backgrounds (Sedbrook et al., 2002; Swarbreck et al., 2019). Sku5 seedlings exhibit reductions of root length but not of cell size, and SKU5 is hypothesized to act in the process of cell division as a result (Sedbrook et al., 2002). SKU5 localizes to the plasma membrane, but is also present in soluble and cell wall-binding forms in the extracellular milieu (Sedbrook et al., 2002; Borderies et al., 2003; Baral et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2018). SKU5 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP), and as such is a component of discrete plasma membrane nanodomains known as “lipid rafts” (Borner et al., 2005; Elortza et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2018; Mamode Cassim et al., 2019). These nanodomains of the plasma membrane and their associated GPI-APs play roles in stress response signaling at the interface between the cell wall and membrane, where they are envisioned to help shape the “signatures” that activate downstream plant adaptive responses to the stresses they experience (Minami et al., 2008; Takahashi et al., 2013, 2016, 2019; Shabala et al., 2015; Yeats et al., 2018; Miki et al., 2019). The endocytosis of SKU5 and other GPI-APs is modulated across the root tip by salt and auxin treatments, linking the movement of these proteins to stress responses (Baral et al., 2015). The expression of SKU5 is itself regulated by boron deprivation, cold, salt, and immune responses, as well as abscisic acid (ABA) treatment (Keinath et al., 2010; Elmore et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2018; Miki et al., 2019). While SKU5 interactors are unknown in Arabidopsis, a maize homolog of SKU5 interacts with a C-terminal peptide of AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) in vitro (Shimomura, 2006). ABP1 is associated with auxin signaling pathways that activate the plant TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) regulatory complex, remodel the cortical microtubule network, and induce expansive growth by triggering cation influx (Xu et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016; Dahlke et al., 2017; Schepetilnikov et al., 2017). This further connects SKU5 to characterized pathways which affect stress responses and regulate the balance between growth and autophagic processes under stressful conditions, such as that of spaceflight. SKU5 and SPR1 are therefore very different proteins in seemingly unrelated physiological processes, but both proteins have roles in root skewing. Both of these proteins are also associated with cell wall remodeling, a process that is regularly involved in spaceflight acclimation. As such, these genes offer an appropriate initial genetic dissection of root skewing and the effect of skewing pathways in the microgravity of spaceflight environments. Extensive discussion of the relevance of skewing and waving in microgravity has been presented elsewhere (e.g., Paul et al., 2012a), but to paraphrase from that paper, prior to spaceflight research, the consensus was that gravitropism was the directional driver in skewing (e.g., Simmons et al., 1995; Oliva and Dunand, 2007). Yet we now know that gravity is not required, and root skewing in spaceflight appears to be an inherent feature of many Arabidopsis ecotypes, even in conditions lacking both light and gravity (Millar et al., 2011; Paul et al., 2012a, 2017; Nakashima et al., 2014). These observations suggest a testable relationship among root morphologies governed by skewing regulation pathways. The hypothesis is that skewing pathways play a large role in spaceflight adaptation via the inherent cell wall remodeling that accompanies those morphologies and the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. This relationship was examined by growing spr1, sku5 and their wild type controls for 4 and 8 days on the International Space Station and at the Kennedy Space Center, then observing both their growth morphologies and gene expression profiles in response to spaceflight as measures of response quality and complexity. A change in gene expression or morphology during spaceflight would suggest a significant role for these skewing genes in the physiological adaptation process. Differential gene expression profiles are often deployed as measures of the underlying gene expression changes needed for physiological adaptation and developmental changes within an organism. Differential gene expression responses, in terms of the number of genes involved and their fold-change levels, may be considered a measure of the metabolic cost of adapting to that environment (e.g.: Chan et al., 2016). Therefore gene expression profiles morphologies were used to examine the relationships between skewing genes and the resulting complexity of spaceflight acclimation. SKU5 and SPR1 function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, which enabled a test of the relevance of contrasting skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. Growth morphologies were used to examine the productivity and developmental success of these genotypes in spaceflight.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Plant Material and Plate Setup Arabidopsis thaliana wild ecotype Columbia (Col-0, CS70000) seed stock, and T-DNA insertion lines for the spr1 (CS6547 – Col-0 background) and sku5 (CS16268 – WS background), were acquired from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) (arabidopsis.org; Lamesch et al., 2011). The wild type Wassilewskija (WS) line used in this study was propagated in our laboratory for more than 25 years. This WS line has been used in multiple spaceflight studies (Paul et al., 2012a, 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019), and seed samples are available upon request. The ABRC denotes WS as stock CS915. Petri dishes (100 mm × 15 mm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, United States), containing 50 mL of a 0.5% Phytagel-based growth medium supplemented with: 0.5× Murashige-Skoog salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 1× Gamborg’s Vitamin Mixture, were prepared aseptically for planting. Seeds were sterilized and planted according to methods allowing for the maintenance of seed dormancy (Sng et al., 2014). Briefly, seeds were stored with Desiccant-Anhydrous Indicating Drierite (W.A. Hammond Drierite Company, stock #24001) for 1 week before sterilization. The seeds were sterilized with 70% ethanol for 10 min and dried in a laminar flow hood. Seeds were stored at 4°C in sterile screw-cap microcentrifuge tubes until planting. Seeds were suspended in sterile water and dispensed onto the media surface. Approximately 12–15 seeds were planted in a row on each plate, with one row on the 8-day (8d) plates and two rows on the 4-day (4d) plates. At time of harvest, each genotype and age was represented by 9–25 viable, replicate seedlings. All replicates contributed to morphological observations, whereas the transcriptome analyses were conducted with four biological replicates, comprising 5–8 4d plant roots, or 2–3 8d plant roots. The plates were sealed with Micropore® (3M, Maplewood, MN, United States) tape, and wrapped in Duvetyne Black-Out Fabric (Seattle Fabrics). The time from suspending dry seeds in water to the completed wrapping of the plate in Duvetyne was less than 10 min; this timing was essential to maintain seed dormancy. Wrapped plates were then transported to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC, FL, United States) under cold stowage, maintaining temperatures of 4–10°C until launch. Spaceflight Experimental Workflow The Advanced Plant Experiments 03-2 (APEX-03-2) study, also known under NASA Operational Nomenclature as the Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System – Intracellular Signaling Architecture (TAGES-ISA) study, has been previously described (Ferl and Paul, 2016; Beisel et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). The SpaceX CRS-5 mission, carrying the dormant, seeded growth plates as part of its cargo, was launched to the International Space Center (ISS) from KSC on January 10, 2015. Capsule docking and transfer of materials to the ISS occurred on January 12 and 13, respectively. The growth plates were removed from cold stowage onboard the ISS on January 26, unwrapped, and inserted into the Vegetable Production System (VPS, colloquially “Veggie”) perpendicular to the light bank (Figure 1A). During the growth period, constant lighting at a level of 100–135 μmol m–2 s–1 was used. Each age and genotype was represented by a 10 cm Petri plate. There were 12–15 seedlings on the 8-day-old plates (8d) and 35–40 seedlings on the 4-day-old plates (4d). The plates were removed from the Veggie plant growth hardware after 4 and 8 days of growth, at which time they were photographed by the crew. The seedlings of each plate were then harvested into individual KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) pre-loaded with RNAlaterTM (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, United States) preservative (one plate per KFT) (Figure 1A). Actuation of the KFT submerged the seedlings in RNAlater and sealed the tube. The harvest tubes remained at ambient temperature for 12 h to allow full perfusion of the tissues, and were then transferred to the MELFI −80°C freezer. The samples were transferred from the MELFI to cold stowage onboard the Dragon capsule on February 9th and remained frozen in transit to KSC for de-integration on February 15, at which time the samples were transferred to 50 mL Falcon tubes with minimal thawing. The samples were transferred to the Principal Investigators and were transported to the University of Florida, where they were kept under −80°C storage. FIGURE 1.

Panel 3 shows astronaut Butch Wilmore harvesting seedlings into a KFT (Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tube), and the workstation used for the orbital harvests. The images of the Veggie hardware and Butch Wilmore were taken on the ISS by NASA; all NASA photos are in the public domain. (B) Full images of plates taken at the time of harvest and from which tissue was used in the APEX-03-2 RNA-Seq experiment. Images from the ground control are in the top two rows, while those from the spaceflight experiment are in the bottom two rows. The genotype and developmental age of the seedlings are listed on each image. The provided images were taken from above the surface of the growth medium.The ground control (GC) for the experiment, composed of an identical set of plants and plates, was performed on a 48-h delay at KSC using Veggie hardware within the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber. The same growth timeline was used, with seedlings being imaged and harvested into RNAlater-containing KFTs at 4d and 8d time points. The GC operations were as described above for the spaceflight experiment, with KSC personnel following the precise timing of the astronaut activities. Telemetry data also enabled the ISSES chamber to replicate the CO2 levels, temperature, and ambient lighting in the vicinity of the Veggie hardware onboard the ISS across the course of the experiment. The consistency of operations between spaceflight and GCs was also checked against video data captured on the ISS. Over-the-shoulder videos of astronaut activities for the 4d and 8d harvests were examined for timing of operations and showed that spaceflight seedling harvests were not disproportionately treated during the process at either time point or compared to GC harvests. The plates were harvested in comparable windows of time, ensuring that no additional stress, such as drought stress, was introduced into the harvest process (Supplementary Table S1). RNA Isolation The spaceflight and GC seedlings, stored in RNAlater, were transferred from −80°C storage to 4°C overnight to thaw. Seedlings in RNAlater were examined with an Olympus SZX12 stereoscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and whole roots were dissected away from the shoot and hypocotyl. The remaining shoot and hypocotyl tissues were restored to −80°C in RNAlater. RNA was prepared from 5–8 4d plant roots, and 2–3 8d plant roots. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiashredder and RNAeasy kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An on-column digestion with RNase-free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was used to remove residual DNA. Library Preparation Library preparation was performed at the University of Florida’s Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) Gene Expression Core. RNA integrity was verified using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States). Of the total RNA, 10 ng were used to construct cDNA libraries with the ClonTech SMART-Seq v4 ultra-low input RNA kit for sequencing (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Cat#: 634890), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1st strand cDNA was primed by the SMART-Seq v4 oligonucleotide, which then base-pairs with these additional nucleotides, creating an extended template. The reverse transcriptase then switches templates and continues transcribing to the end of the oligonucleotide, resulting full-length cDNA that contains an anchor sequence that serves as a universal priming site for second strand synthesis. Then, cDNA was amplified with primer II A for 8 PCR cycles. Illumina sequencing libraries were then generated with 150 pg of cDNA using the Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Cat#: FC-131-1024) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 150 pg of cDNA were fragmented by tagmentation reaction and adapter sequences were added onto template cDNA by PCR amplification. Libraries were quantitated using both the 2100 BioAnalyzer and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). RNA-Seq Sequencing experiments were performed at the UF ICBR Next-Generation DNA Sequencing Core. In preparation for sequencing, barcoded libraries were sized on the 2100 BioAnalyzer, and quantitated by QUBIT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Individual libraries were pooled equimolarly at 4 nM. This “working pool” was used as input in the NextSeq500 instrument sample preparation protocol (Illumina, Part#: 15048776, Rev A). Typically, a 1.3 pM library concentration resulted in an optimal clustering density in our instrument (i.e., ∼200,000 clusters per mm2). Samples were sequenced on 5 flow cells (5 NextSeq500 runs), using a 2 × 75 cycles (paired-end) configuration. A typical sequencing run in the NextSeq500 produced 750–800 million paired-end reads with a Q30 ≥ 85%. For RNA-Seq, around 40 million paired-end reads per sample provided sufficient depth for transcriptome analysis (Tarazona et al., 2011). Bioinformatic Analysis Bioinformatic processing of the sequencing data was performed at the UF ICBR Bioinformatics Core. Fastq files were trimmed to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality base calls using Trimmomatic (version 0.36) with the parameters: LEADING:3, TRAILING:3, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15, MINLEN:50 (Bolger et al., 2014). Quality control of the trimmed reads was performed using FastQC (version 0.11.2) (Andrews, 2010). Reads for each set of Arabidopsis lines were aligned to their respective reference genomes using the STAR aligner (version 2.5.1b) (Dobin et al., 2012). The Col-0 TAIR10 genome release was used for reads from Col-0 and spr1 (Lamesch et al., 2011; Berardini et al., 2015), while reads from WS and sku5 were aligned to the WS reference genome (Gan et al., 2011). Duplicate reads resulting from PCR artifacts were then removed using the Picard MarkDuplicates tool (Broad Institute, 2019b). In total, 502 million transcriptomic reads were aligned. Following alignment, expression quantification and differential gene expression analysis were performed using Cufflinks and Cuffdiff (version 2.2.1), respectively, with default parameters (Trapnell et al., 2010, 2012). Output from Cuffdiff was then parsed with custom scripts to generate the final annotated tables of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A cut-off false-discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was used for calling statistical significance in differential gene expression RNA-Seq Data Analysis Tables of DEGs for each comparison were combined and analyzed through Microsoft Excel, in order to generate lists of Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI) identifiers with their corresponding [Log2(Fold Change)] values. Machine annotation of AGI ID lists was carried out using G:Profiler (Raudvere et al., 2019), while the TAIR (Lamesch et al., 2011; Berardini et al., 2015) and Araport ThaleMine (Krishnakumar et al., 2016) databases were used to investigate genes of interest. DEGs of a comparison (e.g., FLT vs. GC) with a greater than twofold change in at least one context of the comparison were retained for analysis (Supplementary File S1). This was done in order to minimize the effect instituting a cut-off would have on analyzing the expression patterns of a gene. Significant DEGs with a fold-change of “inf” or “-inf” were retained and assigned a [Log2(Fold Change)] value of 10 for heat-mapping, as they have a consistent FPKM of zero in one context but are consistently detected at a significantly higher level in the opposing context. Gene ontology (GO) analyses of only those DEGs with a greater than twofold change were carried out using the lists of their AGI IDs, separated by their up- or downregulation, with the PANTHER statistical overrepresentation tool (Mi et al., 2018). GO terms for each comparison were separated into those unique to one context and those overlapping between contexts, and the output is available in Supplementary File S2. Of those resulting, all GO terms overlapping between contexts were retained for heatmapping. Either one-half or five, whichever was greater, of each context’s unique GO terms were retained after sorting by q-value from most to least significant. GO term lists were then manually pruned in order to reduce highly redundant information (e.g., “cellular response to chemical” and “response to chemical”) only when the redundant terms demonstrated the same pattern of over- or underrepresentation across contexts. Complete lists of genes annotated to specific GO Terms of interest were gathered from AmiGO2 (Carbon et al., 2008). Heatmaps were then generated using DEG [Log2(Fold Change)] values or GO term [-Log(q-value)] values as input for the Morpheus webtool (Broad Institute, 2019a). Measurements of Seedling Roots Germination rates and the growth of roots in each environment were derived from images taken of the growth plates at the times of harvest (Figure 1B). Germination rates were assessed by counting the number of seedlings and ungerminated seeds from the 4-day images taken just prior to harvest. Statistical significance of germination rate changes were assessed using χ2 tests with the conservative Yates correction (Yates, 1934). The comparisons made were between mutant and wild-type lines, and between spaceflight and GC growth conditions. To measure roots, images were analyzed using the FIJI distribution of ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012; Rueden et al., 2017). The JFilament plugin was used to track primary roots, creating a set of points describing each root (Smith et al., 2010). These data were processed using an R script that provided the length of each primary root as output, alongside other measures (Schultz et al., 2016; R Core Team, 2019). Lengths were corrected for scale based on the pixel length of the Petri dish grid-squares to allow for comparisons between images. Differences in root length were assessed through two-tailed Student’s t-tests, with the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing applied (Snedecor and Cochran, 1989). The comparisons made were between spaceflight and GC seedlings for each genotype, and between each skewing mutant and its respective wild-type. As conventional measurements of angles of root growth are dependent upon a reference gravity vector, the roots of 4-day-old seedlings were measured manually using FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012; Rueden et al., 2017). The angle between the root tip and the growth direction of the beginning of the root was used. Positive and negative angles were used to represent rightward and leftward changes in directionality, respectively, relative to the initial direction of growth when viewed from below the growth media. Angles were plotted using the ggplot2 package in R (Wickham, 2016). In these polar plots, the magnitude of a bar corresponds to the number of roots within a particular bin, with the placement of the bar corresponding to the measured angle. Differing upper limits were used for spaceflight (0–20) and GC (0–10) plots in order to allow the many lower-magnitude bins in the spaceflight plots to be visualized by effectively zooming-in on the data. However, the scaling between inner rings is consistent between plots. As such, a bar meeting the second ring at the −25° line indicates that ten roots had an angle shift between 15° and 30° to the left during their growth.",
    "results": "Results APEX-03 seedling growth in occurred in the Veggie hardware on the ISS (Figure 1A). Veggie is housed in the Columbus module (Figure 1A, left), and for the APEX-03 experiment, configured to accommodate racks of 10 cm Petri plates (Figure 1A, middle). Images of plant growth and morphology were recorded by astronaut Butch Wilmore just prior to harvest (Figures 1A, right, B). Col-0 and WS can display distinct patterns of root growth in response to environmental stimuli. In terrestrial environments, changing the angle of the growth surface can create ecotype-specific patterns of skewing (Rutherford and Masson, 1996; Schultz et al., 2017). In a microgravity environment with a gradient light source to impart a tropic cue, skewing patterns of WS and Col-0 recapitulate the patterns seen on terrestrial angled growth surfaces (Paul et al., 2012a). However, in a microgravity environment with uniform, non-directional lighting such as provided by the Veggie hardware in the current experiment, root growth patterns are more disorganized (Figure 1B). Nonetheless, skewing trends can still be discerned by following the angles of growth as the roots develop, and these are quantified in Figure 2A for Col-0 and spr1, and in Figure 2B for WS and sku5. In all representations and discussions of skewing, the direction indicated is from the perspective of being viewed from behind the growth medium. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Quantification of APEX-03-2 Root Growth. Images acquired at the time of harvest of spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) plants were used for measurements. Primary root length measurements for (A) Col-0 and spr1 and (B) WS and sku5 were taken using Jfilament and analyzed in R. Significant differences between genotypes (spr1 vs. Col-0, sku5 vs. WS) and growth conditions (FLT vs. GC) were assessed via two-tailed t-tests and are indicated by asterisks above bars connecting the relevant sets of measurements (Bonferroni correction: ∗p < 0.0125; ∗∗p < 0.001). The 8d Col-0 FLT vs. GC comparison did not meet this cutoff (p = 0.0151). Error bars show the SEM of each set of measurements. (C) The angle measured between the root tip and the initial direction of root growth in the 4-day-old seedlings. Plots are separated into rows by growth condition, and into columns by genotype. Positive and negative angles represent rightward and leftward growth of roots, respectively, when viewed from behind the media. Angles are binned in 10° intervals, with each bar’s length representing the number of roots within that bin. As such, a bar reaching the second ring of each plot represents ten roots within that bin. However, note that the upper limit of bin size is lowered in the spaceflight plots to accommodate the higher variation in these data. The total number of roots represented in each plot is indicated in its bottom-right corner, and the mean angle of each plot is noted in its bottom-left corner. FLT, spaceflight; GC, ground control. Col-0 and Spr1 Germination and Morphology of spr1 in Spaceflight Phenotypic differences among the Col-0 background plants in GC and spaceflight (FLT) environments were primarily limited to skewing angles in the roots (Figures 2, 3). There were no statistically significant differences in the primary root length between GC and FLT in either Col-0 or spr1 4d or 8d plants. Although Col-0 root length appeared to be reduced in spaceflight in 8d plants, the p-value did not quite meet the requirements for significance (two-tailed t-test, p = 0.0152, whereas cut-off was p < 0.0150) (Figure 2A). There were differences in root length between Col-0 and spr1 genotypes in the GC (p = 1.48 E-9) but FLT Col-0 and FLT spr1 roots were not statistically different. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab High resolution images of the Col-0 and spr1 growth patterns. Images are arranged such that the ground control seedlings (A–D) are in the left column while spaceflight seedlings are on the right (E–H). Vertically, images alternate between Col-0 (A,C,E,G) and spr1 (B,D,F,H). The images taken at the 4 day time point (A,B,E,F) are grouped above those taken at the 8 day time point (C,D,G,H). Images taken from above the growth medium at the time of harvest. Grid squares are 13 mm wide.Both 4d and 8d GC Col-0 seedlings grew with very little left or right deviation down the vertical face of the plate medium, while the GC spr1 mutant plants of both ages showed distinct skewing to the left (Figures 2C, 3A–D). The 4d FLT Col-0 plants generally skewed slightly to the left with some variation (Figures 2C, 3E). In contrast, the roots of the 4d FLT spr1 plants demonstrated an increased severity of skewing, which was manifested as a strong left-hand curved growth pattern (Figures 2C, 3E,F) that was significantly different between GC and FLT (two-tailed t-test, p = 0.00385). For both genotypes the variance in the growth angle (as noted in the SD values in Figure 2) was greater in the spaceflight samples. After 8d of growth, the increased skewing in FLT spr1 led to associations with other roots, in contrast to FLT Col-0 which tended to spread more evenly across the plate (Figures 3G,H). There were no differences between GC and FLT the germination rates of either Col-0 or spr1. The 4d harvest images (Figures 3A,B,E,F) were used to compare seedlings with any ungerminated seeds; germination in both genotypes was 100% under both GC and FLT conditions (Supplementary Table S2).The spr1 Spaceflight Response Involved Fewer Transcriptomic Changes Than Col-0 Spaceflight-conditioned differential gene expression patterns were highly dependent upon the genotype, ecotype, and developmental age of seedlings. Quantitative gene expression data revealed patterns from three perspectives: spaceflight versus GCs for each genotype at each developmental age (Figure 4A: FLT vs. GC), wild type plants versus the mutant genotype in each environment and age (Figure 4B: spr1 vs. Col-0) and between the two developmental ages (Figure 4C: 4d vs. 8d). The numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were categorized according to the magnitude of their fold-change values in the Col-0 and spr1 roots. In the FLT vs. GC comparison (Figure 4A), both lines differentially expressed fewer genes at the 8d timepoint than at 4d in all fold-change categories. The spaceflight acclimation of spr1 also required fewer genes than Col-0 to be differentially expressed. In the direct comparison of spr1 with Col-0 (Figure 4B), more DEGs were observed within each growth condition at 4d than at 8d. The difference in total DEG count between conditions was also reduced at 8d. This occurred in almost all fold-change categories, and differences in total DEGs between the lines diminished between timepoints irrespective of the growth condition. In the developmental comparison of expression between the 4d and 8d timepoints (Figure 4C), the roots from the FLT context showed lower counts of total DEGs than their respective GC roots. However, while spr1 required slightly fewer genes to be differentially expressed during development in the GC context, the opposite was true in FLT, where spr1 required more DEGs for spaceflight development than Col-0. Twofold-change categories that did not follow these trends were those of the DEGs upregulated and downregulated more than twofold across spr1 and Col-0 development, respectively, which were larger in FLT than in GC. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Col-0 and spr1 overall differential gene expression levels. A graphic representation of the genes differentially expressed in the (A) FLT vs. GC, (B) 4d vs. 8d, and (C) spr1 vs. Col-0 comparisons.

Data are based on four biological replicates.The relative contributions of DEGs with high degrees of differential expression (greater than twofold change) in response to spaceflight were variable among genotypes and developmental age. In the FLT vs. GC comparison (Figure 4A), the proportion of these DEGs was elevated in spr1 (4d: 41.8%, 8d: 22.0%) relative to Col-0 (4d: 17.8%, 8d: 12.5%), and the difference in this proportion between the lines declined over time. However, when the genotypic comparison of spr1 vs. Col-0 (Figure 4B) was made, the proportion of these DEGs showed the opposite trend. In this case, the level of differential expression was slightly higher in FLT at 4d (GC: 16.5%, FLT: 23.9%) and at 8d the proportion of these DEGs was elevated in GC (GC: 30.2%, FLT: 11.9%). In the developmental comparison (Figure 4C), the primary point of interest was the low number of genes whose expression increased to a high degree over time in Col-0 GC roots (33 DEGs) when compared to the other contexts. In the same time frame, spr1 increased expression of 424 genes over twofold to accomplish the same development. spr1 Differentially Expressed Defense Pathways in Its Spaceflight Response Most of the genes that are highly differentially expressed between the Col-0 and spr1 are unique within the context of developmental age or growth environment (Figure 5A). However, a small number were differentially expressed between genotype irrespective of environment or age (Figure 5A). The coordinately expressed upregulated genes were related to the regulation of defense responses (NIMIN-1, ALD1, DLO1). The only genes that registered as coordinately downregulated in this comparison were SPIRAL1 and an antisense transcript (AT3G29644) of a transposable element which did not show differential expression itself. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Spr1 vs. Col-0; the effects of SPR1 loss on gene expression.

DEG heatmaps are scaled such that yellow and blue represent more extreme levels of up- and downregulation, respectively, while red and green represent lower fold-changes in the same manner. In this case, upregulation of a gene indicates a higher expression level in spr1 than in Col-0. (B,C) Gene ontology (GO) terms for (B) biological processes and (C) cellular compartments whose annotated genes were over- and underrepresented in the lists of DEGs for each context which met the twofold cutoff. The significance of the GO terms’ enrichment is represented by the –Log10 transform of its q-value. The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates.The theme of stress response and defense was also evident in the GO enrichment analyses of the genes differentially expressed between Col-0 and spr1 in the spaceflight environment. The significantly over- and underrepresented GO terms among biological processes are indicated in Figure 5B. Genes associated with general stress responses and environmental stimuli were prominent, as well as those annotated to terms related to defense responses. DEGs associated with these defense and stress pathways have been noted in the FLT vs. GC comparisons of previous studies (e.g., Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Genes involved in responses to salicylic acid, a phytohormone linked to both plant defense signaling and regulation of plant development (Klessig et al., 2018), were also enriched. Carbon fixation pathways, and specifically multiple ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCo) genes, were also upregulated in 4d FLT spr1 (Figures 5B,C). Genes encoding proteins localized to the apoplast were also enriched among those upregulated in FLT spr1, indicating that significant remodeling of processes within the cell was also needed by spr1 within the spaceflight environment (Figure 5C). Many of the DEGs associated with the acclimation to spaceflight were unique to genotype and to the developmental age of the plants (Figure 6A). There were 554 genes differentially expressed by at least twofold between spaceflight and ground among the two age groups (4d and 8d) of the two genotypes (Col-0 and spr1), with 63 genes coordinately expressed across all plants. Developmental age had a substantial impact on the spaceflight response of both genotypes; in both Col-0 and spr1, the 4d plants had a higher number of DEGs than the 8d plants. There was a large amount of overlap between the GO processes identified from the DEGs used to acclimate to the FLT condition for spr1 and Col-0 (Figure 6B). Among the more widely shared GO categories in the 4d plants of both genotypes were those corresponding to the regulation of gene expression and transcriptional processes. These were more highly enriched in spr1 roots than in Col-0, however, it can also be seen that there is a spr1-specific enrichment of the same terms among those genes which are downregulated in the response to FLT. The term for a response to karrikin compounds (phytohormone-like molecules derived from burning plant material) was also indicated. Many light signaling terms also appeared as enriched among DEGs downregulated in FLT, and these were involved with the response to various wavelengths of light as well as the response to elevated light intensity. However, specific photosynthetic terms appeared amongst those which were downregulated only at 8d in Col-0. Similar localization terms appeared specifically in 8d Col-0 as well (Figure 6C), indicating that these were changes in the expression of genes directly involved in the photosynthetic machinery. While both spr1 and Col-0 4d were enriched with DEGs localized to the apoplast, these were among the upregulated genes in spr1 and the downregulated genes in Col-0, alongside other terms related to extracellular structures. Furthermore, terms related to organellar localization were significantly underrepresented in those genes upregulated in Col-0 at 4d. FIGURE 6.

The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates.The expression of genes associated with the developmental age was impacted by the spaceflight environment (Figure 7A). Approximately 26% of the total DEGs meeting the criteria for inclusion were required to be differentially expressed at some level regardless of the growth condition or genotypic background to facilitate development. However, among only those DEGs which met the twofold change cutoff, there were not GO terms shared so ubiquitously between contexts (Figure 7B). While broad GO terms for gene expression and metabolic processes were underrepresented in many of the contexts, more specific terms related to developmental and metabolic regulation were enriched during development in Col-0. Genes related to oxidative stress were also enriched among those genes more highly expressed at 4d in FLT in both genotypes. Localization GO term enrichments were highly divided between intracellular and extracellular compartments, which were consistently underrepresented and overrepresented, respectively (Figure 7C). These underrepresented GO terms occur mostly within the sets of DEGs which were upregulated between 4d and 8d, with many more significantly enriched in spr1. The primary exception to this was a set of terms related to the chloroplast and the RuBisCo complex, which were mostly enriched in those DEGs more highly expressed in early development of spr1.

Data are based on four biological replicates. WS and Sku5 Germination and Morphology of sku5 in Spaceflight Phenotypic differences among the WS background plants in GC and FLT environments included root length and skewing angles (Figures 2, 8). The primary root lengths of FLT WS were decreased significantly compared to GC at 8d (two-tailed t-test, p = 0.000209), but not at 4d. There were no differences in root lengths between GC and FLT sku5 plants of either 4d or 8d plants (Figures 2B, 8C,D,G,H). There were differences in root length between WS and sku5 genotypes in the GC (p = 0.0013) but FLT WS and FLT sku5 roots were not statistically different (Figures 2B, 8C,D,G,H). FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab High resolution images of the WS and sku5 growth patterns. Images are arranged such that the ground control seedlings (A–D) are in the left column while spaceflight seedlings are on the right (E–H). Vertically, images alternate between WS (A,C,E,G) and sku5 (B,D,F,H). The images taken at the 4d time point (A,B,E,F) are above those taken at the 8d time point (C,D,G,H). Images taken from above the growth medium at the time of harvest. Grid squares are 13 mm wide.There were no statistically significant differences in the overall change from vertical between WS and sku5 in either GC or FLT environments (Figures 2C, 8A–D). The differences in root angles between GC and FLT for each genotype, and between the WS and sku5 genotypes in both FLT and GC environments, also failed to meet statistical criteria. However, visual inspection of the images, and also the plots of Figure 2C, illustrate the difference in the directional trends for root growth in each genotype and environment. For both genotypes the variance in the growth angle (as noted in the SD values in Figure 2) was greater in the spaceflight samples. The FLT sku5 seeds germinated at a significantly reduced rate (48%) compared to WS FLT (85%), and to sku5 GC (77%) and WS GC (93%) [χ2 (3, N = 185) = 15.01, p = 0.00181] (Supplementary Table S2 and Figures 8A,B,E,F). However, the FLT sku5 seeds that germinated produced plants that were comparable to their GC counterparts, as evidenced both by plate images and by the lack of difference in root length between FLT and GC sku5 at 4 and 8d (Figures 2B, 8B,D,F,H).The Expression of More Genes Is Altered in sku5 Than in WS During Spaceflight The trends of differential expression in WS and the sku5 line contrasted with those seen in Col-0 and spr1 in that WS and sku5 show an elevated transcriptomic response to spaceflight over time, with sku5 further differentially expressing more genes than WS (Figure 9). The clearest example of this was the FLT vs. GC comparison of gene expression for these lines, where the number of DEGs required for spaceflight acclimation of sku5 were fivefold and twofold more than WS at 4d and 8d, respectively (Figure 9A: FLT vs. GC). However, both genotypes increase in their DEG counts between 4d and 8d. The proportion of DEGs with a greater than twofold change also decreased to a very similar degree for both WS (4d: 63.2%, 8d: 14.5%) and sku5 (4d: 62.8%, 8d: 14.2%) despite the large difference in counts. When the genotypes were compared directly, the transcriptomic differences between them were exacerbated as they acclimated to the flight condition over time (Figure 9B: sku5 vs. WS). The proportion of DEGs meeting the twofold change criteria followed a similar trend to that seen in flight acclimation, where it decreased in both GC (4d: 40.9%, 8d: 13.0%) and FLT (4d: 52.8%, 8d: 9.3%). Despite these trends, most genes among the FLT 4d DEGs that had greater than twofold change were those that were expressed more highly in sku5. This trend persisted into the 4d vs. 8d comparison (Figure 9C: 4d vs. 8d), where sku5 in the FLT condition required more genes to be differentially expressed in order to develop. Sku5 in the GC condition behaved much like WS in both FLT and GC conditions in terms of DEG counts in each fold-change category. Together, these patterns of gene expression indicated that the conditions of spaceflight had a disproportionate effect on the sku5 roots’ transcriptomic responses, but that each genotype’s response to spaceflight over time involved a greater number of DEGs of lower fold-changes. FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab WS and sku5 overall differential gene expression levels.

Data are based on four biological replicates. Sku5 Highly Induced ABA- and Stress-Associated Genes in Spaceflight The genes differentially expressed between sku5 and WS were similar between GC and FLT growth conditions (Figure 10A), in that the same genes that were highly upregulated in WS GC were highly upregulated in FLT for sku5. Among these were many late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) family proteins, whose expression has been connected to enhanced resistance to abiotic stresses and alterations in ABA sensitivity (Zhao et al., 2011; Candat et al., 2014). Additional LEA family genes and seed storage proteins, such as CRUCIFERINA (CRA1) and CRUCIFERIN 3 (CRA3) were seen as upregulated uniquely in sku5 FLT. Alongside these were further genes associated with ABA- or ABA-independent dormancy signaling, notably REDUCED DORMANCY 5 (RDO5), DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1), and HIGHLY ABA-INDUCED PROTEIN 2 and 3 (HAI2, HAI3). In 4d sku5 spaceflight plants, genes encoding LEAs and other seed-associated proteins are among the most highly induced (Log2[5 to 10], or 30 to 1000-fold). Many of these patterns are further supported by GO biological process term enrichments (Figure 10B), where almost all of the overrepresented terms are enriched within the group of genes more highly expressed by sku5 roots at 4d in FLT. Outside of the mentioned ABA signaling and seed development genes, terms for regulation of seed dormancy and negative regulation of post-embryonic development are overrepresented, alongside more general terms such as responses to temperature and stress. All of the significant GO localization enrichments were for genes more highly expressed in WS in the 4d FLT context, involving either DEGs related to the RuBisCo complex or extracellular structures (Figure 10C). DEGs encoding proteins anchored to the PM are enriched for this group, indicating an important role for them in WS. FIGURE 10.

In this case, upregulation of a gene indicates a higher expression level in sku5 than in WS. (B,C) Gene ontology (GO) terms for (B) biological processes and (C) cellular compartments whose annotated genes were over- and underrepresented in the lists of DEGs for each context which met the twofold cutoff. The significance of the GO terms’ enrichment is represented by the –Log10 transform of its q-value. The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates.Many of the LEAs and ABA-responsive DEGs in the sku5 vs. WS comparison were also highly upregulated by sku5 in the FLT vs. GC comparison, and some were unique to the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 (Figures 10A, 11A). The majority of FLT vs. GC DEGs (70.3%) were only detected in one of the sku5 FLT vs. GC comparison contexts. As such, the majority of the GO biological process terms found to be enriched were unique to the DEGs upregulated in FLT sku5 at the 4d time point (Figure 11B). Hormone response and signal transduction terms were enriched, with ethylene signaling, ROS response, and light signaling among the more specific pathways to be represented. In tandem, these 4d sku5 roots had decreased enrichment of DEGs associated with the synthesis of suberin. Uniquely to this comparison, 8d FLT WS roots upregulated genes related to chromatin remodeling. As seen in other comparisons (Figures 6C, 7C, 10C), WS upregulated genes annotated to the RuBisCo complex in FLT (Figure 11C). Additionally, the 8d downregulated DEGs for WS were overrepresented for extracellular localization, and DEGs whose products localized to intracellular and organellar compartments were underrepresented (Figure 11C). However, sku5 showed overrepresentation of downregulated DEGs annotated to the extracellular region at the earlier time point of 4d. FIGURE 11.

The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates.Late embryogenesis abundant family genes were also prominently represented in the 4d vs. 8d comparison within GC and FLT environments (Figure 12A). Examination of the GO biological process terms yielded by the individual lists of DEGs showed many similar stress response terms, but these were primarily in the context of genes more highly expressed at the 4d time point (Figure 12B). However, based on the level of significance of the terms, the enrichment of DEGs related to many of these stress responses was enhanced in FLT. In the cases of oxidative stress and cold response sku5 showed this enhancement. However, in some cases, such as the response to desiccation, both genotypes showed a lack of significant term enrichment in FLT. The sku5 roots also showed slightly higher significance of enrichment of DEGs associated with responses to water deprivation and light stimuli in early FLT development, compared to WS. GO terms related to cell wall remodeling and immune responses, commonly seen in FLT acclimation, were also enhanced in their enrichment during FLT development of sku5 compared to GC development. The remainder of the significant GO terms were unique to one context, and among these is the response to karrikin, which was previously seen in the context of spr1 and Col-0 FLT vs. GC comparisons (Figure 6B). Of the terms enriched specifically in sku5 FLT development, processes involved with salt and ROS stress, as well as light responses, were significantly higher at 4d. At 8d, the terms associated with sku5 in FLT were primarily focused on cell wall remodeling and biosynthetic processes. FIGURE 12.

    "discussion": "Discussion The discovery that root skewing was not gravity-dependent, and prevalent in both light-grown and dark-grown plants in spaceflight habitats (Millar et al., 2011; Paul et al., 2012a; Nakashima et al., 2014), invited questions about the underlying mechanisms of this behavior in the microgravity environment and the relationship between those mechanisms and physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The experiments described here examined the contribution of two well-characterized skewing genes that are in two different ecotypic backgrounds and which affect different skewing control pathways. SPIRAL1 plays a role in directional cell expansion by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics (Furutani et al., 2000; Nakajima et al., 2004; Sedbrook et al., 2004; Galva et al., 2014). SKU5 is a skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall and plasma membrane protein, which has also been implicated in stress response signaling (Sedbrook et al., 2002). The sku5 and spr1 mutants are well characterized in terrestrial environments, skewing rightward and leftward, respectively, when grown vertically (Furutani et al., 2000; Sedbrook et al., 2002, 2004; Nakajima et al., 2004). The experimental readouts used to assess the physiological adjustment of seedlings to spaceflight were root and germination measurements, and the differences in transcriptomic responses among the genotypes. The opposing directions of the skewing phenotypes of the mutant lines are believed to stem from alterations of distinct cellular processes, and this is most clearly evidenced by the differential effects of microtubule-destabilizing agents on these mutants (Furutani et al., 2000; Sedbrook et al., 2002, 2004; Nakajima et al., 2004; Galva et al., 2014). The distinct roles of these two genes in determining root directionality is supported by their different individual responses to spaceflight in the present experiments. The data from sku5 and spiral1 are analyzed in context with their parent genotype, WS and Col-0 respectively, as WS shows a much smaller number of spaceflight differentially expressed genes than Col-0 (Paul et al., 2017, and Figures 4, 12). Spr1 Skews Leftward on Earth and Moreso in Space Terrestrial studies concluded that SPR1 reinforces rightward root growth by affecting the balance of thigmotropism and gravitropism (Galva et al., 2014). Morphological data from APEX-03-2 support this notion. At the 4d time point, spr1 seedlings showed a consistent leftward skewing phenotype on Earth, and the leftward skewing was substantially enhanced by spaceflight (Figures 2C, 3B,F). However, spr1 and Col-0 roots were the same length in spaceflight, indicating that the role of SPR1 lies in directionality rather than overall root length in spaceflight (Figure 2A). These data suggest that in the absence of gravitropism during spaceflight, thigmotropism plays a dominant role in growth directionality and that SPR1 acts to positively enhance skewing while not affecting root length in spaceflight. The spaceflight effect of spr1 lies in morphology management rather than growth management. SPR1 binds with another microtubule plus-end tracking protein, EB1b (Galva et al., 2014). It has been postulated that EB1b and SPR1 work in concert to regulate mechanical force-based directional growth with a balance of gravitropism and thigmotropism, where SPR1 participates in the reinforcement of rightward growth through thigmotropic processes, while EB1b negatively regulates thigmotropism and positively regulates gravitropism (Galva et al., 2014). In an environment lacking a gravity cue such as spaceflight, this gravitropic reinforcement has no effect, resulting in the enhanced skewing of spr1. Similarly elevated leftward skewing of spr1 occurs under cold conditions alongside alterations of the microtubule network, and skewing is conversely suppressed by heat or salt treatments (Furutani et al., 2000; Sedbrook et al., 2004). The elevated skewing seen in spr1 may therefore be the result of spaceflight-induced signals in the root which are similar to those involved in cold response signaling. The microtubule-associated protein MAP65-1 is more abundant in spaceflight, and is also hypothesized to be linked to cold-responsive microtubule stabilization (Chen et al., 2016; Soga et al., 2018). Actin cytoskeleton mutants also exhibit a greater degree of skewing in microgravity when compared to wild-type and GC plants, though this skewing occurs to the right when regarded from behind the media (Nakashima et al., 2014). These structural systems both appear to have roles in suppressing endogenous root skewing patterns in spaceflight. The spaceflight-enhanced skewing of spr1 may therefore be attributed to its altered microtubule dynamics in the spaceflight response, similar to altered dynamics induced by terrestrial cold stress. Sku5 Skews Inappropriately in Spaceflight The sku5 mutant did not show an enhancement of skewing in spaceflight as compared to the GC, nor did sku5 respond to the spaceflight environment in the same manner as it does to terrestrial disruption of the gravity vector (Figure 2C) (Sedbrook et al., 2002). However, sku5 and WS roots were the same length in spaceflight, indicating that the role of SKU5 also lies in directionality rather than overall root length in spaceflight (Figure 2B). These data suggest that SKU5, like SPR1, regulates morphology and directionality rather than growth. However, SKU5 regulation is very different from SPR1 regulation of skewing morphology in that lack of SKU5 function prevents appropriate skewing in spaceflight. This prevention of skewing, the sku5 interruption of the pathways involved in skewing, leads to dramatic changes in differential expression of genes for physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Differential Gene Expression as a Measure of the Quantity and Character of the Physiological Adaptation to Spaceflight Differential gene expression profiles reveal the underlying gene expression changes needed for physiological adaptation to environmental changes. There are numerous, well-documented environmentally-induced gene expression profiles in plants, all of which detail specific physiological changes related to the specific stresses. The intensity of the differential gene expression response, in terms of the number of genes involved and their fold-change levels, may be considered a measure of the metabolic cost of adapting to that environment. A terrestrial example of this metabolic cost is in the transcriptomic response to cold stress in Arabidopsis lines that are either sensitive or resistant to cold (Chan et al., 2016). Plants that overexpressed RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION 4 (RDM4) had a cold-tolerant phenotype, and exhibited a greatly reduced transcriptomic response to cold stress compared to the more cold-sensitive wild-type and rdm4 knock-out plants (Chan et al., 2016). The plants that were least able to tolerate cold environments displayed a far higher number (up to 100×) of differentially expressed genes in response to cold than the cold-tolerant plants exposed to the same environment (Chan et al., 2016). Spr1 adapts to spaceflight with far fewer DEGs than Col-0. This suggests that mutation of the SPR1 skewing pathway enhances spaceflight physiological adaptation. In contrast, the sku5 mutation results in a doubling of DEGs in response to spaceflight, and many of those DEGs are members of strong environmental stress responses. This strong response suggests that the SKU5 pathway plays a key role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. Sku5 Mutation Produces a Dramatic Increase in Differential Gene Expression in Spaceflight Sku5 showed a dramatic program of differential gene expression compared to the GCs, a program that was more pronounced and diverse than that of spr1. Many of the genes that are significantly differentially expressed between spaceflight and GCs are associated with skewing and cell wall remodeling, irrespective of intensity of skewing phenotype in the spaceflight-grown plants (Figure 13). FIGURE 13. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed genes between FLT and GC of particular interest. Statistically significant DEGs with greater than twofold magnitude in at least one context. Each gene in this list corresponded to the following categories: potential and highly probable skew gene candidates (Skewing, HPSGC; Schultz et al., 2017), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA; Hundertmark and Hincha, 2008), associated with gravitropism (GO Terms; Carbon et al., 2008), and abscisic acid (ABA, GO Terms; Carbon et al., 2008). The heat map scale Log2(Fold-Change) is indicated in the bottom right corner. Categorical information is provided beside each gene group. Data are based on four biological replicates.One of the unique aspects of the sku5 spaceflight differential gene expression program involved genes usually associated with dehydration and ABA signaling. The FLT sku5 expression patterns of LEAs and other ABA-associated genes suggest a spaceflight adaptation phenomenon involving, but not limited to, an altered ABA sensitivity in these plants. Many of the highest magnitude DEGs in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 were in the LEA family, primarily dehydrins and group-4 LEAs; many of these genes were induced by greater than 30-fold [Log2(5)] (Figure 13). LEAs are responsive to ABA signaling resulting from osmotic, cold, and drought stresses and act to enhance stress resistance through membrane stabilization, sequestration of ROS, and prevention of protein aggregation (Hundertmark and Hincha, 2008; Zhao et al., 2011; Candat et al., 2014; Fang and Xiong, 2015; Suzuki et al., 2016). Many of the DEGs and LEAs upregulated in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 are associated with embryonic programs that are adjusted at the chromatin level during germination in response to environmental factors (Tai et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2012; Molitor et al., 2014). DOG1, for example, increases in expression in cold temperatures, acting to repress germination during those unfavorable conditions (Footitt et al., 2013, 2014). The sku5 DEGs HAI2 and HAI3 are involved in regulating ABA signaling and responding to soil water potential (Bhaskara et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013). REDUCED DORMANCY 5 also acts to inhibit germination, but functions independently of DOG1 and ABA signaling pathways (Xiang et al., 2014). The GO term enrichments for sku5 also support this, as DEGs associated with dormancy regulation are overrepresented in the dataset (Figures 10B, 12B). It is important to note that SKU5 is expressed in floral tissue (Sedbrook et al., 2002). This altered ABA signaling in sku5 could therefore be attributed to downstream effects of altered seed development. In support of these interpretations, germination rates were repressed in FLT sku5 (Figures 8F,H) relative to GC sku5 (Figures 8B,D), and to FLT WS (Figures 8E,G), as evidenced by counts of ungerminated seeds in the harvest images (Supplementary Table S2). While spr1 is also expressed in reproductive tissues, the differential expression of dormancy signaling genes was not prevalent in the Col-0 and spr1 comparisons (Nakajima et al., 2004; Sedbrook et al., 2004). In fact, those few DEGs related to ABA signaling observed in Col-0 and spr1 displayed a trend in expression that was opposite of what was seen in FLT sku5. As a prime example, the LEA ABA-RESPONSE PROTEIN (ABR) was only slightly downregulated in the spaceflight acclimation of 8d spr1. ABA-related dormancy signaling may be affected by the spaceflight environment. Differential expression patterns also indicate that sku5 mutants experience changes in the plasma membrane during spaceflight. Alterations in plasma membrane dynamics and composition occur in plant responses to terrestrial stressors (e.g., cold stress) and in the response of Chlorella vulgaris to spaceflight (Popova et al., 1989; Solanke and Sharma, 2008; Kazemi-Shahandashti and Maali-Amiri, 2018). Roots of Pisum sativum grown under clinorotation also show shifts in membrane composition in sterol-enriched membrane domains known as “lipid rafts” (Kordyum et al., 2018). Membrane-bound GPI-APs, such as SKU5, localize to these lipid raft nanodomains and are important to stress acclimation, including spaceflight-associated stress (Minami et al., 2008; Mazars et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015; Takahashi et al., 2016, 2019; Yeats et al., 2018). ABA signaling proteins also localize to these membrane domains in a sterol-dependent manner (Demir et al., 2013). Given that sku5 shows alterations of ABA signaling pathways in spaceflight (Figure 13), it can be hypothesized that the lack of SKU5 may affect the function of these nanodomain-localized ABA signaling processes under stress conditions. The expression of a chloroplastic aldehyde reductase, ChlADR (AT1G54870), involved in the detoxification of reactive carbonyls formed as a result of lipid peroxidation, and TSPO, which participates in mobilization of lipids, are induced by stress and highly induced in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 (Guillaumot et al., 2009; Yamauchi et al., 2011; Jurkiewicz et al., 2018). These patterns match the gene expression trends of the spaceflight-induced LEA family genes that are thought to directly participate in membrane stabilization under stress (Battaglia et al., 2008; Hundertmark and Hincha, 2008; Candat et al., 2014). The gene expression patterns of these ABA-responsive genes in sku5 suggest that SKU5 affects ABA signaling in response to stresses. Furthermore, this shows that pathways affecting membrane stabilization and remodeling are required for the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 that are not essential for its growth in terrestrial environments. SKU5 may also directly participate in stress response signaling or cellular remodeling due to its localization to the outer aspects of the plasma membrane. A SKU5 homolog is highly upregulated [Log2(14)] in tobacco overexpressing a FATTY ACID DESATURASE 3 (CbFAD3-OE) homolog derived from the cryophyte Chorispora bungeana when compared to a wild-type line in the response to salt stress (Shi et al., 2018). CbFAD3-OE lines exhibited enhanced membrane fluidity and survival under cold, salt, and drought stresses, and demonstrated reduced lipid peroxidation and membrane leakage via activation of calcium signaling and suppression of ROS (Shi et al., 2018). As such, the sku5 line may require alternative pathways to be activated to maintain membrane fluidity and integrity during spaceflight acclimation due to the removal of SKU5 from this response pathway. The transcriptomic response of sku5 to the spaceflight condition was elevated compared to WS, which would support the activation of additional pathways (Figures 10A, 11A). ROS-related genes are abundant in spaceflight transcriptomes, and reflect a response to spaceflight that is conserved among Arabidopsis cultivars and related species (Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015; Sng et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). Our findings were consistent with this trend across genotypes and the skewing mutants based on GO term enrichments associated with the spaceflight response (Figures 6B, 11B). Notably, sku5 FLT showed elevated expression of genes required to be expressed in response to ROS at the 4d when compared to FLT WS (Figures 9B, 10B), supporting this hypothesized function of SKU5 in this membrane-associated ROS suppression. While FAD3 was not among the sku5 FLT DEGs, FLORAL TRANSITION AT THE MERISTEM1 (FTM1), which catalyzes the desaturation of stearic acid to oleic acid upstream of FAD3, was upregulated in WS and spr1 spaceflight acclimation, and downregulated in that of Col-0 and sku5. FTM1 participates alongside FAD3 in the mediation of stresses associated with Arabidopsis crown gall development through their enrichment with C18:3 fatty acids (Klinkenberg et al., 2014). The increase of C18:3 class of fatty acids also correlated with the enhanced membrane stability measures in the CbFAD3-OE lines (Shi et al., 2018). These results therefore suggest a role for SKU5 in stress metabolism with respect to the plasma membrane, a role that was not revealed in previous ground experiments. An additional explanation for the altered spaceflight response of sku5 comes from its likely association with auxin metabolism and signaling upstream of the plant TOR complex. A SKU5 homolog in maize encodes an interactor of AUXIN-BINDNG PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) (Shimomura, 2006). The abp1 mutant demonstrates a leftward-skewing phenotype opposite to that seen in sku5 (Sedbrook et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2015). Auxin gradients are still present in spaceflight root tips despite the lack of a gravity cue in the spaceflight environment (Ferl and Paul, 2016). The presence of SKU5 acting to mediate anisotropic cell growth in response to endogenous auxin gradients could facilitate the spaceflight acclimation of wild-type seedlings. GO terms associated with the DEGs of 4d spaceflight response of sku5 suggested this connection as well, with many alterations occurring in signaling pathways related to ethylene, ROS, and light signaling (Figure 11B). Furthermore, ABP1 is associated with the activation of TOR and the promotion of growth through the action of an auxin-activated signaling pathway mediated by the RHO OF PLANTS 2 (ROP2) GTPase (Xu et al., 2014; Schepetilnikov et al., 2017; Ryabova et al., 2019). The TOR complex integrates diverse environmental signals to regulate growth, and ABA signaling inhibits TOR, promoting autophagy to allow for stress tolerance acquisition (Ryabova et al., 2019; Signorelli et al., 2019). SKU5 may impact this mechanism indirectly through affecting the action of ABP1, and a reduction of the auxin signaling into TOR would shift the balance in favor of stronger ABA responses, such as that seen in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5. A ROP6 pathway also mediated by ABP1 affects the activity of KATANIN, which severs cortical microtubules to facilitate reorganization of the microtubule network in response to environmental stimuli (Chen et al., 2016). As a result, the spr1 mutant may be faster to form a spaceflight-tolerant microtubule network due to its altered microtubule kinetics, while the sku5 mutant may not be able to perform this function as rapidly due to altered ABP1 signaling. Spr1 Mutation Produces a Decrease in Differential Gene Expression in Spaceflight The spaceflight DEGs of spr1 and Col-0 were primarily in the defense and salicylic acid-mediated signaling related to cell wall remodeling (Figures 5B, 6B). Genes related to these cell wall pathways are common in spaceflight transcriptomes (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Correll et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017). While plants grown in microgravity may be more susceptible to pathogenic infection (Leach et al., 2001; Ryba-White et al., 2001), the fact that all examples to date of upregulated pathogen response genes are from plants grown in sterile conditions suggests that these genes are serving other purposes of cell wall remodeling in spaceflight (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Correll et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2019). ALD1 is a positive regulator of salicylic acid accumulation pathways through the generation of metabolites (Nie et al., 2011; Cecchini et al., 2015). NIMIN1 and DLO1 contribute to opposing processes, acting to repress immune responses at the level of expression regulation (Kohler et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2013; Zeilmaker et al., 2015). Salicylic acid induces the lipid raft-localized pathways induced by ABA, in order to promote cellular uptake of water (Demir et al., 2013; Prodhan et al., 2018). The upregulation of salicylic acid signaling in spr1 may act through these pathways, promoting abiotic stress response through pathways normally associated with defense responses (Figures 5B, 6B). This hypothesis might also explain why the induction of “defense” and wound response pathways occurs in spaceflight in the absence of pathogenic infections (Nejat and Mantri, 2017). The recently characterized ORBITALLY MANIFESTED GENE 1, a regulator of ROS signaling that is both flg22- and wound-inducible, provides a spaceflight-relevant example (Sng et al., 2018). Considering that wounding and pathogen invasion also mechanically disrupt membranes and cell walls (Chen et al., 2016), these pathways may be signaling remodeling of cellular structures and the microtubule network in spaceflight. Flg22 application to Arabidopsis cell cultures and induction of MAMP-triggered immunity also has the effect of redistributing flavonoid compounds from biosynthetic processes important to oxidative stress response processes to the production of compounds important to defense (Schenke et al., 2019). Genes associated with the production of phenylpropanoids are less-represented among the spr1 DEGs downregulated in spaceflight compared to Col-0, although they are also more highly represented among spr1 DEGs downregulated across development in spaceflight (Figures 6B, 7B). As such, these DEGs negatively regulating defense signaling in spr1 may contribute to an enhanced ability to mediate ROS generated in spaceflight through the redistribution of limited resources early in its development. This conclusion is also supported by the gene categories enriched in the spaceflight acclimations of Col-0 and spr1, where DEGs associated with responses to oxidative stress are more enriched among genes upregulated in FLT in spr1 than in Col-0 (Figure 6B). Many abiotic stresses trigger remodeling of cortical microtubules, with salt stress tolerance requiring the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of SPR1 (Shoji et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2016). Microtubule reorientation also contributes to cell elongation in the spaceflight response of hypocotyls (Soga et al., 2018). The spr1 mutant, which has altered microtubule dynamics in favor of decreased stability, may have enhanced capabilities for remodeling of microtubule networks in the response to many forms of environmental stress (Galva et al., 2014). Spr1 and Sku5 Mutants Both Differentially Regulate Skewing-Associated Genes in Response to Spaceflight Despite the many differing spaceflight responses of spr1 and sku5, DEGs identified as likely to be associated with the integrative signaling of skewing (Schultz et al., 2017) were among those differentially expressed in both mutants in spaceflight (Figure 13). Two of the highly likely skewing genes, SENESCENCE 1 (SEN1) and ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE 1 (ASN1) are induced in spaceflight (Figure 13). The SKU5 protein is endocytosed through different pathways within the root tip dependent on local auxin signals and perceived stress conditions (Baral et al., 2015). SKU5 could act to modulate growth regulation through its aforementioned association with the ABP1 apoplastic signaling pathway upstream of TOR, and both SKU5 and SPR1 can affect microtubule reorganizing pathways. This would enable SKU5 to impact the spaceflight response via the regulation of meristematic competence and cell cycle progression, processes that are affected in spaceflight (Matía et al., 2010), clinorotation, RPM exposure, and magnetic levitation (Herranz and Medina, 2014; Herranz et al., 2014; Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., 2016). This is supported by the M-phase peak of SKU5 expression and its previously hypothesized role in regulating the cell cycle (Menges et al., 2002; Sedbrook et al., 2002). However, the importance of senescence in the context of root skewing has not been well-studied. The recent association of strigolactone-independent karrikin-sensing pathways with skewing provides a potential direction for study (Swarbreck et al., 2019). The loss of the protein MORE AXILLARY BRANCHES 2 (MAX2), which also participates in strigolactone-associated senescence signaling, exacerbates the skewing phenotype of sku5 in a sku5 max2 line (Ueda and Kusaba, 2015; Swarbreck et al., 2019). Therefore, these results reinforce connections between environmental and senescence signaling and root skewing. The association of skewing-associated genes with these regulatory networks provide a means by which the mutation of these genes can alter the response to the spaceflight condition.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion The physiological adaptation of sku5 to spaceflight is characterized by powerful stress responses, as well as the strong induction of LEAs and other genes associated with seed development. In contrast to sku5, spr1 differentially expressed fewer genes than Col-0 to physiologically adapt to spaceflight. This observation suggests that the spr1 mutation imbued an enhanced ability for rapid spaceflight acclimation while sku5 required an extended spaceflight response to accomplish acclimation, even to the point of initiating classic deep stress responses. These observations further suggest that the functional distinctions between sku5 and spr1 inform distinct aspects of the spaceflight response in plants, in particular the responses of young seedlings. The dramatic responses of sku5 suggest that lipid raft nanodomains of the plasma membrane and their associated GPI-APs play important roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The fact that sku5 and spr1 show markedly different gene expression patterns in spaceflight suggests that the two skewing pathways highlighted by SKU5 and SPR1 differentially affect the mechanisms used by plants to physiologically acclimate to spaceflight. Since spr1 and sku5 root lengths are not altered by spaceflight, the effects of these mutations lie not in the process of growth, but in the processes that direct morphology and structure, likely tying together the large number of cell wall remodeling genes observed as differentially expressed in spaceflight. The data from APEX-03-2 therefore provide an initial functional dissection of the spaceflight response in roots, one that allows an integration of pathways associated with root directionality, morphology and physiological responses to spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 7064724 PMID: 32194611 Abstract The observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Further, spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. SPIRAL1 is a skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In this study, both sku5 and spr1 mutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereas sku5 showed considerably more than its WS wild-type. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The spr1 response is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the sku5 responses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation. Keywords: spaceflight, root, skewing, transcriptomics, abiotic stress, acclimation, physiological adaptationIntroduction Spaceflight studies offer unique insights into plant biological processes, and enable the exploration of the relationships between root morphology, gene expression and the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The developmental patterns of plant organs are continuously altered through perception of the environment, signal integration, and response to environmental stimuli. A diversity of tropic gradients influence the path of growth in roots by initiating localized, asymmetrical changes in cell elongation. These changes are primarily brought about through hormonal interactions and subsequent remodeling of cell physiology (Roy and Bassham, 2014; Vandenbrink et al., 2014; Schultz et al., 2017). Root skewing and waving are phenomena in which root growth deviates from a gravity vector throughout its development, and which vary between the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) ecotypes Columbia (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (WS) (Rutherford and Masson, 1996; Roy and Bassham, 2014; Schultz et al., 2017). Although once thought to be a gravity-dependent growth behavior (Oliva and Dunand, 2007), skewing occurs in the microgravity of spaceflight (Paul et al., 2012a). This suggests that skewing is independent of both the tropic force of gravity and the gravity-induced contact forces between roots and growth media (Millar et al., 2011; Paul et al., 2012a, 2013; Nakashima et al., 2014). Therefore, the spaceflight environment provides a unique and relevant context in which to study genes associated with skewing phenotypes. Plants grown in the spaceflight environment exhibit complex and unique gene expression patterns (e.g., Paul et al., 2005; Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Correll et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). The predominant feature of the spaceflight environment is microgravity. The lack of gravity has a direct effect on plant cells and signal transduction; this direct effect represents a novel environment for plants, and any terrestrial organism, and appears to be generally perceived as stressful. In addition, microgravity imposes secondary environmental stresses due to the disruption of fluid movement, and any processes influenced by convection, such as gas exchange and temperature redistribution. Combinatorial stresses induce changes in gene expression and tolerance that are not fully recapitulated by exposure to the individual stressors (e.g., Ramegowda and Senthil-Kumar, 2015; Suzuki et al., 2016). Thus it is important to think of the spaceflight environment as more complex than microgravity alone. Several classes of stress response genes have been identified as consistently involved in the response to spaceflight across ecotypes of Arabidopsis via analyses of gene expression. Heat shock genes are often induced by spaceflight (Paul et al., 2005, 2012b; Salmi and Roux, 2008; Shagimardanova et al., 2010; Zupanska et al., 2013, 2017, 2019; Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and scavenging processes are also common in the spaceflight response, though ROS-associated genes have been observed as both up- and downregulated in spaceflight (Shagimardanova et al., 2010; Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Kwon et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). Some stress gene expression changes are also associated with spaceflight-induced changes in the Arabidopsis methylome (Zhou et al., 2019). Cell wall remodeling processes are enriched in spaceflight gene expression datasets (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Correll et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017). Cell wall remodeling genes, typically associated with biotic stress and pathogen defense pathways, also contribute to spaceflight acclimation (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Correll et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2019). Spaceflight also affects abundances of proteins of defense pathways and cell wall remodeling (Mazars et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015). However, the particular genetic pathways activated and repressed in spaceflight vary among ecotypes of Arabidopsis, demonstrating that there are significant genotypic contributions to spaceflight physiological adaptation (Paul et al., 2017; Beisel et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2019). Mutations in genes associated with stress response and signaling pathways can significantly alter the differential gene expression profiles of spaceflight physiological adaptation. Single gene mutations in heat shock transcription factors, gravity perception genes, and light signaling genes in Arabidopsis seedlings and cultures exhibit altered spaceflight responses (Paul et al., 2017; Zupanska et al., 2017, 2019). Therefore, we sought to understand better the relationships among spaceflight responses, root morphology, and spaceflight adaptation by exploring the spaceflight responses of two single gene skewing-related mutant lines: spiral1 and sku5. Spiral1 (Spr1) is a skewing-related gene that contributes to the process of anisotropic cell expansion by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. The spr1 mutation results in axial rotation of cell files throughout the plant, which manifests in the roots as skewing to the left when viewed, according to convention, from beneath their growth medium (Rutherford and Masson, 1996; Furutani et al., 2000; Nakajima et al., 2004; Sedbrook et al., 2004; Galva et al., 2014). The SPR1 protein is a microtubule plus-end tracking protein that localizes to the plus ends of actively polymerizing cortical microtubules, dissociating upon a shift to microtubule depolymerization (Sedbrook et al., 2004; Galva et al., 2014). This association is mediated by two similar motifs on the N- and C-termini of the protein, which allow SPR1 to act as an intermolecular linker (Nakajima et al., 2004; Sedbrook et al., 2004; Galva et al., 2014). The protein END-BINDING 1B (EB1b) co-localizes with SPR1 at the microtubule plus-end, where each protein interacts with the other as well as tubulin subunits (Galva et al., 2014). This creates the dual effects of SPR1 and EB1b increasing microtubule stability and polymerization rate, while also enhancing the rescue rate of depolymerizing microtubules (Galva et al., 2014). However, the spr1 mutation also leads to a decreased rate of shrinkage among depolymerizing microtubules (Galva et al., 2014). The regulation of microtubule dynamics is critical to many environmental responses, such as in salt stress where 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of SPR1 is known to occur in conjunction with microtubule reorganization to enable stress acclimation (Shoji et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2016). In addition to these micro-scale changes, the skewing phenotype of spr1 is significantly enhanced by cold treatment, and suppressed by both salt and heat stresses (Furutani et al., 2000; Sedbrook et al., 2004). This connects SPR1 to processes regulating morphology in both optimal and stressful environments. Sku5 is a skewing-associated gene that encodes a protein in the SKU5-SIMILAR (SKS) family, which is related to known Arabidopsis copper oxidases, but which contains only one Type-II copper-coordinating domain of unknown specificity (Sedbrook et al., 2002). The sku5 mutant was originally noted for the rightward skewing it exhibits on vertically oriented growth media, which manifests in both WS and Col-0 backgrounds (Sedbrook et al., 2002; Swarbreck et al., 2019). Sku5 seedlings exhibit reductions of root length but not of cell size, and SKU5 is hypothesized to act in the process of cell division as a result (Sedbrook et al., 2002). SKU5 localizes to the plasma membrane, but is also present in soluble and cell wall-binding forms in the extracellular milieu (Sedbrook et al., 2002; Borderies et al., 2003; Baral et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2018). SKU5 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP), and as such is a component of discrete plasma membrane nanodomains known as “lipid rafts” (Borner et al., 2005; Elortza et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2018; Mamode Cassim et al., 2019). These nanodomains of the plasma membrane and their associated GPI-APs play roles in stress response signaling at the interface between the cell wall and membrane, where they are envisioned to help shape the “signatures” that activate downstream plant adaptive responses to the stresses they experience (Minami et al., 2008; Takahashi et al., 2013, 2016, 2019; Shabala et al., 2015; Yeats et al., 2018; Miki et al., 2019). The endocytosis of SKU5 and other GPI-APs is modulated across the root tip by salt and auxin treatments, linking the movement of these proteins to stress responses (Baral et al., 2015). The expression of SKU5 is itself regulated by boron deprivation, cold, salt, and immune responses, as well as abscisic acid (ABA) treatment (Keinath et al., 2010; Elmore et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2018; Miki et al., 2019). While SKU5 interactors are unknown in Arabidopsis, a maize homolog of SKU5 interacts with a C-terminal peptide of AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) in vitro (Shimomura, 2006). ABP1 is associated with auxin signaling pathways that activate the plant TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) regulatory complex, remodel the cortical microtubule network, and induce expansive growth by triggering cation influx (Xu et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016; Dahlke et al., 2017; Schepetilnikov et al., 2017). This further connects SKU5 to characterized pathways which affect stress responses and regulate the balance between growth and autophagic processes under stressful conditions, such as that of spaceflight. SKU5 and SPR1 are therefore very different proteins in seemingly unrelated physiological processes, but both proteins have roles in root skewing. Both of these proteins are also associated with cell wall remodeling, a process that is regularly involved in spaceflight acclimation. As such, these genes offer an appropriate initial genetic dissection of root skewing and the effect of skewing pathways in the microgravity of spaceflight environments. Extensive discussion of the relevance of skewing and waving in microgravity has been presented elsewhere (e.g., Paul et al., 2012a), but to paraphrase from that paper, prior to spaceflight research, the consensus was that gravitropism was the directional driver in skewing (e.g., Simmons et al., 1995; Oliva and Dunand, 2007). Yet we now know that gravity is not required, and root skewing in spaceflight appears to be an inherent feature of many Arabidopsis ecotypes, even in conditions lacking both light and gravity (Millar et al., 2011; Paul et al., 2012a, 2017; Nakashima et al., 2014). These observations suggest a testable relationship among root morphologies governed by skewing regulation pathways. The hypothesis is that skewing pathways play a large role in spaceflight adaptation via the inherent cell wall remodeling that accompanies those morphologies and the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. This relationship was examined by growing spr1, sku5 and their wild type controls for 4 and 8 days on the International Space Station and at the Kennedy Space Center, then observing both their growth morphologies and gene expression profiles in response to spaceflight as measures of response quality and complexity. A change in gene expression or morphology during spaceflight would suggest a significant role for these skewing genes in the physiological adaptation process. Differential gene expression profiles are often deployed as measures of the underlying gene expression changes needed for physiological adaptation and developmental changes within an organism. Differential gene expression responses, in terms of the number of genes involved and their fold-change levels, may be considered a measure of the metabolic cost of adapting to that environment (e.g.: Chan et al., 2016). Therefore gene expression profiles morphologies were used to examine the relationships between skewing genes and the resulting complexity of spaceflight acclimation. SKU5 and SPR1 function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, which enabled a test of the relevance of contrasting skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. Growth morphologies were used to examine the productivity and developmental success of these genotypes in spaceflight.Materials and Methods Plant Material and Plate Setup Arabidopsis thaliana wild ecotype Columbia (Col-0, CS70000) seed stock, and T-DNA insertion lines for the spr1 (CS6547 – Col-0 background) and sku5 (CS16268 – WS background), were acquired from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) (arabidopsis.org; Lamesch et al., 2011). The wild type Wassilewskija (WS) line used in this study was propagated in our laboratory for more than 25 years. This WS line has been used in multiple spaceflight studies (Paul et al., 2012a, 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019), and seed samples are available upon request. The ABRC denotes WS as stock CS915. Petri dishes (100 mm × 15 mm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, United States), containing 50 mL of a 0.5% Phytagel-based growth medium supplemented with: 0.5× Murashige-Skoog salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 1× Gamborg’s Vitamin Mixture, were prepared aseptically for planting. Seeds were sterilized and planted according to methods allowing for the maintenance of seed dormancy (Sng et al., 2014). Briefly, seeds were stored with Desiccant-Anhydrous Indicating Drierite (W.A. Hammond Drierite Company, stock #24001) for 1 week before sterilization. The seeds were sterilized with 70% ethanol for 10 min and dried in a laminar flow hood. Seeds were stored at 4°C in sterile screw-cap microcentrifuge tubes until planting. Seeds were suspended in sterile water and dispensed onto the media surface. Approximately 12–15 seeds were planted in a row on each plate, with one row on the 8-day (8d) plates and two rows on the 4-day (4d) plates. At time of harvest, each genotype and age was represented by 9–25 viable, replicate seedlings. All replicates contributed to morphological observations, whereas the transcriptome analyses were conducted with four biological replicates, comprising 5–8 4d plant roots, or 2–3 8d plant roots. The plates were sealed with Micropore® (3M, Maplewood, MN, United States) tape, and wrapped in Duvetyne Black-Out Fabric (Seattle Fabrics). The time from suspending dry seeds in water to the completed wrapping of the plate in Duvetyne was less than 10 min; this timing was essential to maintain seed dormancy. Wrapped plates were then transported to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC, FL, United States) under cold stowage, maintaining temperatures of 4–10°C until launch.Spaceflight Experimental Workflow The Advanced Plant Experiments 03-2 (APEX-03-2) study, also known under NASA Operational Nomenclature as the Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System – Intracellular Signaling Architecture (TAGES-ISA) study, has been previously described (Ferl and Paul, 2016; Beisel et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). The SpaceX CRS-5 mission, carrying the dormant, seeded growth plates as part of its cargo, was launched to the International Space Center (ISS) from KSC on January 10, 2015. Capsule docking and transfer of materials to the ISS occurred on January 12 and 13, respectively. The growth plates were removed from cold stowage onboard the ISS on January 26, unwrapped, and inserted into the Vegetable Production System (VPS, colloquially “Veggie”) perpendicular to the light bank (Figure 1A). During the growth period, constant lighting at a level of 100–135 μmol m–2 s–1 was used. Each age and genotype was represented by a 10 cm Petri plate. There were 12–15 seedlings on the 8-day-old plates (8d) and 35–40 seedlings on the 4-day-old plates (4d). The plates were removed from the Veggie plant growth hardware after 4 and 8 days of growth, at which time they were photographed by the crew. The seedlings of each plate were then harvested into individual KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) pre-loaded with RNAlaterTM (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, United States) preservative (one plate per KFT) (Figure 1A). Actuation of the KFT submerged the seedlings in RNAlater and sealed the tube. The harvest tubes remained at ambient temperature for 12 h to allow full perfusion of the tissues, and were then transferred to the MELFI −80°C freezer. The samples were transferred from the MELFI to cold stowage onboard the Dragon capsule on February 9th and remained frozen in transit to KSC for de-integration on February 15, at which time the samples were transferred to 50 mL Falcon tubes with minimal thawing. The samples were transferred to the Principal Investigators and were transported to the University of Florida, where they were kept under −80°C storage. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 overview. (A) Images detailing the standard procedures used onboard the ISS during the experiment. In Panel 1, the Vegetable Production System (VPS, “Veggie”) and its local environment can be seen, while panel 2 provides a close-up of the plate setup inside Veggie after insertion. Panel 3 shows astronaut Butch Wilmore harvesting seedlings into a KFT (Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tube), and the workstation used for the orbital harvests. The images of the Veggie hardware and Butch Wilmore were taken on the ISS by NASA; all NASA photos are in the public domain. (B) Full images of plates taken at the time of harvest and from which tissue was used in the APEX-03-2 RNA-Seq experiment. Images from the ground control are in the top two rows, while those from the spaceflight experiment are in the bottom two rows. The genotype and developmental age of the seedlings are listed on each image. The provided images were taken from above the surface of the growth medium.The ground control (GC) for the experiment, composed of an identical set of plants and plates, was performed on a 48-h delay at KSC using Veggie hardware within the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber. The same growth timeline was used, with seedlings being imaged and harvested into RNAlater-containing KFTs at 4d and 8d time points. The GC operations were as described above for the spaceflight experiment, with KSC personnel following the precise timing of the astronaut activities. Telemetry data also enabled the ISSES chamber to replicate the CO2 levels, temperature, and ambient lighting in the vicinity of the Veggie hardware onboard the ISS across the course of the experiment. The consistency of operations between spaceflight and GCs was also checked against video data captured on the ISS. Over-the-shoulder videos of astronaut activities for the 4d and 8d harvests were examined for timing of operations and showed that spaceflight seedling harvests were not disproportionately treated during the process at either time point or compared to GC harvests. The plates were harvested in comparable windows of time, ensuring that no additional stress, such as drought stress, was introduced into the harvest process (Supplementary Table S1).RNA Isolation The spaceflight and GC seedlings, stored in RNAlater, were transferred from −80°C storage to 4°C overnight to thaw. Seedlings in RNAlater were examined with an Olympus SZX12 stereoscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and whole roots were dissected away from the shoot and hypocotyl. The remaining shoot and hypocotyl tissues were restored to −80°C in RNAlater. RNA was prepared from 5–8 4d plant roots, and 2–3 8d plant roots. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiashredder and RNAeasy kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An on-column digestion with RNase-free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was used to remove residual DNA.Library Preparation Library preparation was performed at the University of Florida’s Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) Gene Expression Core. RNA integrity was verified using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States). Of the total RNA, 10 ng were used to construct cDNA libraries with the ClonTech SMART-Seq v4 ultra-low input RNA kit for sequencing (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Cat#: 634890), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1st strand cDNA was primed by the SMART-Seq v4 oligonucleotide, which then base-pairs with these additional nucleotides, creating an extended template. The reverse transcriptase then switches templates and continues transcribing to the end of the oligonucleotide, resulting full-length cDNA that contains an anchor sequence that serves as a universal priming site for second strand synthesis. Then, cDNA was amplified with primer II A for 8 PCR cycles. Illumina sequencing libraries were then generated with 150 pg of cDNA using the Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Cat#: FC-131-1024) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 150 pg of cDNA were fragmented by tagmentation reaction and adapter sequences were added onto template cDNA by PCR amplification. Libraries were quantitated using both the 2100 BioAnalyzer and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824).RNA-Seq Sequencing experiments were performed at the UF ICBR Next-Generation DNA Sequencing Core. In preparation for sequencing, barcoded libraries were sized on the 2100 BioAnalyzer, and quantitated by QUBIT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Individual libraries were pooled equimolarly at 4 nM. This “working pool” was used as input in the NextSeq500 instrument sample preparation protocol (Illumina, Part#: 15048776, Rev A). Typically, a 1.3 pM library concentration resulted in an optimal clustering density in our instrument (i.e., ∼200,000 clusters per mm2). Samples were sequenced on 5 flow cells (5 NextSeq500 runs), using a 2 × 75 cycles (paired-end) configuration. A typical sequencing run in the NextSeq500 produced 750–800 million paired-end reads with a Q30 ≥ 85%. For RNA-Seq, around 40 million paired-end reads per sample provided sufficient depth for transcriptome analysis (Tarazona et al., 2011).Bioinformatic Analysis Bioinformatic processing of the sequencing data was performed at the UF ICBR Bioinformatics Core. Fastq files were trimmed to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality base calls using Trimmomatic (version 0.36) with the parameters: LEADING:3, TRAILING:3, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15, MINLEN:50 (Bolger et al., 2014). Quality control of the trimmed reads was performed using FastQC (version 0.11.2) (Andrews, 2010). Reads for each set of Arabidopsis lines were aligned to their respective reference genomes using the STAR aligner (version 2.5.1b) (Dobin et al., 2012). The Col-0 TAIR10 genome release was used for reads from Col-0 and spr1 (Lamesch et al., 2011; Berardini et al., 2015), while reads from WS and sku5 were aligned to the WS reference genome (Gan et al., 2011). Duplicate reads resulting from PCR artifacts were then removed using the Picard MarkDuplicates tool (Broad Institute, 2019b). In total, 502 million transcriptomic reads were aligned. Following alignment, expression quantification and differential gene expression analysis were performed using Cufflinks and Cuffdiff (version 2.2.1), respectively, with default parameters (Trapnell et al., 2010, 2012). Output from Cuffdiff was then parsed with custom scripts to generate the final annotated tables of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A cut-off false-discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was used for calling statistical significance in differential gene expressionRNA-Seq Data Analysis Tables of DEGs for each comparison were combined and analyzed through Microsoft Excel, in order to generate lists of Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI) identifiers with their corresponding [Log2(Fold Change)] values. Machine annotation of AGI ID lists was carried out using G:Profiler (Raudvere et al., 2019), while the TAIR (Lamesch et al., 2011; Berardini et al., 2015) and Araport ThaleMine (Krishnakumar et al., 2016) databases were used to investigate genes of interest. DEGs of a comparison (e.g., FLT vs. GC) with a greater than twofold change in at least one context of the comparison were retained for analysis (Supplementary File S1). This was done in order to minimize the effect instituting a cut-off would have on analyzing the expression patterns of a gene. Significant DEGs with a fold-change of “inf” or “-inf” were retained and assigned a [Log2(Fold Change)] value of 10 for heat-mapping, as they have a consistent FPKM of zero in one context but are consistently detected at a significantly higher level in the opposing context. Gene ontology (GO) analyses of only those DEGs with a greater than twofold change were carried out using the lists of their AGI IDs, separated by their up- or downregulation, with the PANTHER statistical overrepresentation tool (Mi et al., 2018). GO terms for each comparison were separated into those unique to one context and those overlapping between contexts, and the output is available in Supplementary File S2. Of those resulting, all GO terms overlapping between contexts were retained for heatmapping. Either one-half or five, whichever was greater, of each context’s unique GO terms were retained after sorting by q-value from most to least significant. GO term lists were then manually pruned in order to reduce highly redundant information (e.g., “cellular response to chemical” and “response to chemical”) only when the redundant terms demonstrated the same pattern of over- or underrepresentation across contexts. Complete lists of genes annotated to specific GO Terms of interest were gathered from AmiGO2 (Carbon et al., 2008). Heatmaps were then generated using DEG [Log2(Fold Change)] values or GO term [-Log(q-value)] values as input for the Morpheus webtool (Broad Institute, 2019a).Measurements of Seedling Roots Germination rates and the growth of roots in each environment were derived from images taken of the growth plates at the times of harvest (Figure 1B). Germination rates were assessed by counting the number of seedlings and ungerminated seeds from the 4-day images taken just prior to harvest. Statistical significance of germination rate changes were assessed using χ2 tests with the conservative Yates correction (Yates, 1934). The comparisons made were between mutant and wild-type lines, and between spaceflight and GC growth conditions. To measure roots, images were analyzed using the FIJI distribution of ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012; Rueden et al., 2017). The JFilament plugin was used to track primary roots, creating a set of points describing each root (Smith et al., 2010). These data were processed using an R script that provided the length of each primary root as output, alongside other measures (Schultz et al., 2016; R Core Team, 2019). Lengths were corrected for scale based on the pixel length of the Petri dish grid-squares to allow for comparisons between images. Differences in root length were assessed through two-tailed Student’s t-tests, with the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing applied (Snedecor and Cochran, 1989). The comparisons made were between spaceflight and GC seedlings for each genotype, and between each skewing mutant and its respective wild-type. As conventional measurements of angles of root growth are dependent upon a reference gravity vector, the roots of 4-day-old seedlings were measured manually using FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012; Rueden et al., 2017). The angle between the root tip and the growth direction of the beginning of the root was used. Positive and negative angles were used to represent rightward and leftward changes in directionality, respectively, relative to the initial direction of growth when viewed from below the growth media. Angles were plotted using the ggplot2 package in R (Wickham, 2016). In these polar plots, the magnitude of a bar corresponds to the number of roots within a particular bin, with the placement of the bar corresponding to the measured angle. Differing upper limits were used for spaceflight (0–20) and GC (0–10) plots in order to allow the many lower-magnitude bins in the spaceflight plots to be visualized by effectively zooming-in on the data. However, the scaling between inner rings is consistent between plots. As such, a bar meeting the second ring at the −25° line indicates that ten roots had an angle shift between 15° and 30° to the left during their growth.Results APEX-03 seedling growth in occurred in the Veggie hardware on the ISS (Figure 1A). Veggie is housed in the Columbus module (Figure 1A, left), and for the APEX-03 experiment, configured to accommodate racks of 10 cm Petri plates (Figure 1A, middle). Images of plant growth and morphology were recorded by astronaut Butch Wilmore just prior to harvest (Figures 1A, right, B). Col-0 and WS can display distinct patterns of root growth in response to environmental stimuli. In terrestrial environments, changing the angle of the growth surface can create ecotype-specific patterns of skewing (Rutherford and Masson, 1996; Schultz et al., 2017). In a microgravity environment with a gradient light source to impart a tropic cue, skewing patterns of WS and Col-0 recapitulate the patterns seen on terrestrial angled growth surfaces (Paul et al., 2012a). However, in a microgravity environment with uniform, non-directional lighting such as provided by the Veggie hardware in the current experiment, root growth patterns are more disorganized (Figure 1B). Nonetheless, skewing trends can still be discerned by following the angles of growth as the roots develop, and these are quantified in Figure 2A for Col-0 and spr1, and in Figure 2B for WS and sku5. In all representations and discussions of skewing, the direction indicated is from the perspective of being viewed from behind the growth medium. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Quantification of APEX-03-2 Root Growth. Images acquired at the time of harvest of spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) plants were used for measurements. Primary root length measurements for (A) Col-0 and spr1 and (B) WS and sku5 were taken using Jfilament and analyzed in R. Significant differences between genotypes (spr1 vs. Col-0, sku5 vs. WS) and growth conditions (FLT vs. GC) were assessed via two-tailed t-tests and are indicated by asterisks above bars connecting the relevant sets of measurements (Bonferroni correction: ∗p < 0.0125; ∗∗p < 0.001). The 8d Col-0 FLT vs. GC comparison did not meet this cutoff (p = 0.0151). Error bars show the SEM of each set of measurements. (C) The angle measured between the root tip and the initial direction of root growth in the 4-day-old seedlings. Plots are separated into rows by growth condition, and into columns by genotype. Positive and negative angles represent rightward and leftward growth of roots, respectively, when viewed from behind the media. Angles are binned in 10° intervals, with each bar’s length representing the number of roots within that bin. As such, a bar reaching the second ring of each plot represents ten roots within that bin. However, note that the upper limit of bin size is lowered in the spaceflight plots to accommodate the higher variation in these data. The total number of roots represented in each plot is indicated in its bottom-right corner, and the mean angle of each plot is noted in its bottom-left corner. FLT, spaceflight; GC, ground control.Col-0 and Spr1 Germination and Morphology of spr1 in Spaceflight Phenotypic differences among the Col-0 background plants in GC and spaceflight (FLT) environments were primarily limited to skewing angles in the roots (Figures 2, 3). There were no statistically significant differences in the primary root length between GC and FLT in either Col-0 or spr1 4d or 8d plants. Although Col-0 root length appeared to be reduced in spaceflight in 8d plants, the p-value did not quite meet the requirements for significance (two-tailed t-test, p = 0.0152, whereas cut-off was p < 0.0150) (Figure 2A). There were differences in root length between Col-0 and spr1 genotypes in the GC (p = 1.48 E-9) but FLT Col-0 and FLT spr1 roots were not statistically different. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab High resolution images of the Col-0 and spr1 growth patterns. Images are arranged such that the ground control seedlings (A–D) are in the left column while spaceflight seedlings are on the right (E–H). Vertically, images alternate between Col-0 (A,C,E,G) and spr1 (B,D,F,H). The images taken at the 4 day time point (A,B,E,F) are grouped above those taken at the 8 day time point (C,D,G,H). Images taken from above the growth medium at the time of harvest. Grid squares are 13 mm wide.Both 4d and 8d GC Col-0 seedlings grew with very little left or right deviation down the vertical face of the plate medium, while the GC spr1 mutant plants of both ages showed distinct skewing to the left (Figures 2C, 3A–D). The 4d FLT Col-0 plants generally skewed slightly to the left with some variation (Figures 2C, 3E). In contrast, the roots of the 4d FLT spr1 plants demonstrated an increased severity of skewing, which was manifested as a strong left-hand curved growth pattern (Figures 2C, 3E,F) that was significantly different between GC and FLT (two-tailed t-test, p = 0.00385). For both genotypes the variance in the growth angle (as noted in the SD values in Figure 2) was greater in the spaceflight samples. After 8d of growth, the increased skewing in FLT spr1 led to associations with other roots, in contrast to FLT Col-0 which tended to spread more evenly across the plate (Figures 3G,H). There were no differences between GC and FLT the germination rates of either Col-0 or spr1. The 4d harvest images (Figures 3A,B,E,F) were used to compare seedlings with any ungerminated seeds; germination in both genotypes was 100% under both GC and FLT conditions (Supplementary Table S2).The spr1 Spaceflight Response Involved Fewer Transcriptomic Changes Than Col-0 Spaceflight-conditioned differential gene expression patterns were highly dependent upon the genotype, ecotype, and developmental age of seedlings. Quantitative gene expression data revealed patterns from three perspectives: spaceflight versus GCs for each genotype at each developmental age (Figure 4A: FLT vs. GC), wild type plants versus the mutant genotype in each environment and age (Figure 4B: spr1 vs. Col-0) and between the two developmental ages (Figure 4C: 4d vs. 8d). The numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were categorized according to the magnitude of their fold-change values in the Col-0 and spr1 roots. In the FLT vs. GC comparison (Figure 4A), both lines differentially expressed fewer genes at the 8d timepoint than at 4d in all fold-change categories. The spaceflight acclimation of spr1 also required fewer genes than Col-0 to be differentially expressed. In the direct comparison of spr1 with Col-0 (Figure 4B), more DEGs were observed within each growth condition at 4d than at 8d. The difference in total DEG count between conditions was also reduced at 8d. This occurred in almost all fold-change categories, and differences in total DEGs between the lines diminished between timepoints irrespective of the growth condition. In the developmental comparison of expression between the 4d and 8d timepoints (Figure 4C), the roots from the FLT context showed lower counts of total DEGs than their respective GC roots. However, while spr1 required slightly fewer genes to be differentially expressed during development in the GC context, the opposite was true in FLT, where spr1 required more DEGs for spaceflight development than Col-0. Twofold-change categories that did not follow these trends were those of the DEGs upregulated and downregulated more than twofold across spr1 and Col-0 development, respectively, which were larger in FLT than in GC.

A graphic representation of the genes differentially expressed in the (A) FLT vs. GC, (B) 4d vs. 8d, and (C) spr1 vs. Col-0 comparisons.

Data are based on four biological replicates.The relative contributions of DEGs with high degrees of differential expression (greater than twofold change) in response to spaceflight were variable among genotypes and developmental age. In the FLT vs. GC comparison (Figure 4A), the proportion of these DEGs was elevated in spr1 (4d: 41.8%, 8d: 22.0%) relative to Col-0 (4d: 17.8%, 8d: 12.5%), and the difference in this proportion between the lines declined over time. However, when the genotypic comparison of spr1 vs. Col-0 (Figure 4B) was made, the proportion of these DEGs showed the opposite trend. In this case, the level of differential expression was slightly higher in FLT at 4d (GC: 16.5%, FLT: 23.9%) and at 8d the proportion of these DEGs was elevated in GC (GC: 30.2%, FLT: 11.9%). In the developmental comparison (Figure 4C), the primary point of interest was the low number of genes whose expression increased to a high degree over time in Col-0 GC roots (33 DEGs) when compared to the other contexts. In the same time frame, spr1 increased expression of 424 genes over twofold to accomplish the same development. spr1 Differentially Expressed Defense Pathways in Its Spaceflight Response Most of the genes that are highly differentially expressed between the Col-0 and spr1 are unique within the context of developmental age or growth environment (Figure 5A). However, a small number were differentially expressed between genotype irrespective of environment or age (Figure 5A). The coordinately expressed upregulated genes were related to the regulation of defense responses (NIMIN-1, ALD1, DLO1). The only genes that registered as coordinately downregulated in this comparison were SPIRAL1 and an antisense transcript (AT3G29644) of a transposable element which did not show differential expression itself.

The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates.The theme of stress response and defense was also evident in the GO enrichment analyses of the genes differentially expressed between Col-0 and spr1 in the spaceflight environment. The significantly over- and underrepresented GO terms among biological processes are indicated in Figure 5B. Genes associated with general stress responses and environmental stimuli were prominent, as well as those annotated to terms related to defense responses. DEGs associated with these defense and stress pathways have been noted in the FLT vs. GC comparisons of previous studies (e.g., Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Genes involved in responses to salicylic acid, a phytohormone linked to both plant defense signaling and regulation of plant development (Klessig et al., 2018), were also enriched. Carbon fixation pathways, and specifically multiple ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCo) genes, were also upregulated in 4d FLT spr1 (Figures 5B,C). Genes encoding proteins localized to the apoplast were also enriched among those upregulated in FLT spr1, indicating that significant remodeling of processes within the cell was also needed by spr1 within the spaceflight environment (Figure 5C). Many of the DEGs associated with the acclimation to spaceflight were unique to genotype and to the developmental age of the plants (Figure 6A). There were 554 genes differentially expressed by at least twofold between spaceflight and ground among the two age groups (4d and 8d) of the two genotypes (Col-0 and spr1), with 63 genes coordinately expressed across all plants. Developmental age had a substantial impact on the spaceflight response of both genotypes; in both Col-0 and spr1, the 4d plants had a higher number of DEGs than the 8d plants. There was a large amount of overlap between the GO processes identified from the DEGs used to acclimate to the FLT condition for spr1 and Col-0 (Figure 6B). Among the more widely shared GO categories in the 4d plants of both genotypes were those corresponding to the regulation of gene expression and transcriptional processes. These were more highly enriched in spr1 roots than in Col-0, however, it can also be seen that there is a spr1-specific enrichment of the same terms among those genes which are downregulated in the response to FLT. The term for a response to karrikin compounds (phytohormone-like molecules derived from burning plant material) was also indicated. Many light signaling terms also appeared as enriched among DEGs downregulated in FLT, and these were involved with the response to various wavelengths of light as well as the response to elevated light intensity. However, specific photosynthetic terms appeared amongst those which were downregulated only at 8d in Col-0. Similar localization terms appeared specifically in 8d Col-0 as well (Figure 6C), indicating that these were changes in the expression of genes directly involved in the photosynthetic machinery. While both spr1 and Col-0 4d were enriched with DEGs localized to the apoplast, these were among the upregulated genes in spr1 and the downregulated genes in Col-0, alongside other terms related to extracellular structures. Furthermore, terms related to organellar localization were significantly underrepresented in those genes upregulated in Col-0 at 4d. FIGURE 6.

The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates.The expression of genes associated with the developmental age was impacted by the spaceflight environment (Figure 7A). Approximately 26% of the total DEGs meeting the criteria for inclusion were required to be differentially expressed at some level regardless of the growth condition or genotypic background to facilitate development. However, among only those DEGs which met the twofold change cutoff, there were not GO terms shared so ubiquitously between contexts (Figure 7B). While broad GO terms for gene expression and metabolic processes were underrepresented in many of the contexts, more specific terms related to developmental and metabolic regulation were enriched during development in Col-0. Genes related to oxidative stress were also enriched among those genes more highly expressed at 4d in FLT in both genotypes. Localization GO term enrichments were highly divided between intracellular and extracellular compartments, which were consistently underrepresented and overrepresented, respectively (Figure 7C). These underrepresented GO terms occur mostly within the sets of DEGs which were upregulated between 4d and 8d, with many more significantly enriched in spr1. The primary exception to this was a set of terms related to the chloroplast and the RuBisCo complex, which were mostly enriched in those DEGs more highly expressed in early development of spr1.

Data are based on four biological replicates.WS and Sku5 Germination and Morphology of sku5 in Spaceflight Phenotypic differences among the WS background plants in GC and FLT environments included root length and skewing angles (Figures 2, 8). The primary root lengths of FLT WS were decreased significantly compared to GC at 8d (two-tailed t-test, p = 0.000209), but not at 4d. There were no differences in root lengths between GC and FLT sku5 plants of either 4d or 8d plants (Figures 2B, 8C,D,G,H). There were differences in root length between WS and sku5 genotypes in the GC (p = 0.0013) but FLT WS and FLT sku5 roots were not statistically different (Figures 2B, 8C,D,G,H). FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab High resolution images of the WS and sku5 growth patterns. Images are arranged such that the ground control seedlings (A–D) are in the left column while spaceflight seedlings are on the right (E–H). Vertically, images alternate between WS (A,C,E,G) and sku5 (B,D,F,H). The images taken at the 4d time point (A,B,E,F) are above those taken at the 8d time point (C,D,G,H). Images taken from above the growth medium at the time of harvest. Grid squares are 13 mm wide.There were no statistically significant differences in the overall change from vertical between WS and sku5 in either GC or FLT environments (Figures 2C, 8A–D). The differences in root angles between GC and FLT for each genotype, and between the WS and sku5 genotypes in both FLT and GC environments, also failed to meet statistical criteria. However, visual inspection of the images, and also the plots of Figure 2C, illustrate the difference in the directional trends for root growth in each genotype and environment. For both genotypes the variance in the growth angle (as noted in the SD values in Figure 2) was greater in the spaceflight samples. The FLT sku5 seeds germinated at a significantly reduced rate (48%) compared to WS FLT (85%), and to sku5 GC (77%) and WS GC (93%) [χ2 (3, N = 185) = 15.01, p = 0.00181] (Supplementary Table S2 and Figures 8A,B,E,F). However, the FLT sku5 seeds that germinated produced plants that were comparable to their GC counterparts, as evidenced both by plate images and by the lack of difference in root length between FLT and GC sku5 at 4 and 8d (Figures 2B, 8B,D,F,H).The Expression of More Genes Is Altered in sku5 Than in WS During Spaceflight The trends of differential expression in WS and the sku5 line contrasted with those seen in Col-0 and spr1 in that WS and sku5 show an elevated transcriptomic response to spaceflight over time, with sku5 further differentially expressing more genes than WS (Figure 9). The clearest example of this was the FLT vs. GC comparison of gene expression for these lines, where the number of DEGs required for spaceflight acclimation of sku5 were fivefold and twofold more than WS at 4d and 8d, respectively (Figure 9A: FLT vs. GC). However, both genotypes increase in their DEG counts between 4d and 8d. The proportion of DEGs with a greater than twofold change also decreased to a very similar degree for both WS (4d: 63.2%, 8d: 14.5%) and sku5 (4d: 62.8%, 8d: 14.2%) despite the large difference in counts. When the genotypes were compared directly, the transcriptomic differences between them were exacerbated as they acclimated to the flight condition over time (Figure 9B: sku5 vs. WS). The proportion of DEGs meeting the twofold change criteria followed a similar trend to that seen in flight acclimation, where it decreased in both GC (4d: 40.9%, 8d: 13.0%) and FLT (4d: 52.8%, 8d: 9.3%). Despite these trends, most genes among the FLT 4d DEGs that had greater than twofold change were those that were expressed more highly in sku5. This trend persisted into the 4d vs. 8d comparison (Figure 9C: 4d vs. 8d), where sku5 in the FLT condition required more genes to be differentially expressed in order to develop. Sku5 in the GC condition behaved much like WS in both FLT and GC conditions in terms of DEG counts in each fold-change category. Together, these patterns of gene expression indicated that the conditions of spaceflight had a disproportionate effect on the sku5 roots’ transcriptomic responses, but that each genotype’s response to spaceflight over time involved a greater number of DEGs of lower fold-changes. FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab WS and sku5 overall differential gene expression levels.

Data are based on four biological replicates. Sku5 Highly Induced ABA- and Stress-Associated Genes in Spaceflight The genes differentially expressed between sku5 and WS were similar between GC and FLT growth conditions (Figure 10A), in that the same genes that were highly upregulated in WS GC were highly upregulated in FLT for sku5. Among these were many late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) family proteins, whose expression has been connected to enhanced resistance to abiotic stresses and alterations in ABA sensitivity (Zhao et al., 2011; Candat et al., 2014). Additional LEA family genes and seed storage proteins, such as CRUCIFERINA (CRA1) and CRUCIFERIN 3 (CRA3) were seen as upregulated uniquely in sku5 FLT. Alongside these were further genes associated with ABA- or ABA-independent dormancy signaling, notably REDUCED DORMANCY 5 (RDO5), DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1), and HIGHLY ABA-INDUCED PROTEIN 2 and 3 (HAI2, HAI3). In 4d sku5 spaceflight plants, genes encoding LEAs and other seed-associated proteins are among the most highly induced (Log2[5 to 10], or 30 to 1000-fold). Many of these patterns are further supported by GO biological process term enrichments (Figure 10B), where almost all of the overrepresented terms are enriched within the group of genes more highly expressed by sku5 roots at 4d in FLT. Outside of the mentioned ABA signaling and seed development genes, terms for regulation of seed dormancy and negative regulation of post-embryonic development are overrepresented, alongside more general terms such as responses to temperature and stress. All of the significant GO localization enrichments were for genes more highly expressed in WS in the 4d FLT context, involving either DEGs related to the RuBisCo complex or extracellular structures (Figure 10C). DEGs encoding proteins anchored to the PM are enriched for this group, indicating an important role for them in WS. FIGURE 10.

In this case, upregulation of a gene indicates a higher expression level in sku5 than in WS. (B,C) Gene ontology (GO) terms for (B) biological processes and (C) cellular compartments whose annotated genes were over- and underrepresented in the lists of DEGs for each context which met the twofold cutoff. The significance of the GO terms’ enrichment is represented by the –Log10 transform of its q-value. The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates.Many of the LEAs and ABA-responsive DEGs in the sku5 vs. WS comparison were also highly upregulated by sku5 in the FLT vs. GC comparison, and some were unique to the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 (Figures 10A, 11A). The majority of FLT vs. GC DEGs (70.3%) were only detected in one of the sku5 FLT vs. GC comparison contexts. As such, the majority of the GO biological process terms found to be enriched were unique to the DEGs upregulated in FLT sku5 at the 4d time point (Figure 11B). Hormone response and signal transduction terms were enriched, with ethylene signaling, ROS response, and light signaling among the more specific pathways to be represented. In tandem, these 4d sku5 roots had decreased enrichment of DEGs associated with the synthesis of suberin. Uniquely to this comparison, 8d FLT WS roots upregulated genes related to chromatin remodeling. As seen in other comparisons (Figures 6C, 7C, 10C), WS upregulated genes annotated to the RuBisCo complex in FLT (Figure 11C). Additionally, the 8d downregulated DEGs for WS were overrepresented for extracellular localization, and DEGs whose products localized to intracellular and organellar compartments were underrepresented (Figure 11C). However, sku5 showed overrepresentation of downregulated DEGs annotated to the extracellular region at the earlier time point of 4d. FIGURE 11.

The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates.Late embryogenesis abundant family genes were also prominently represented in the 4d vs. 8d comparison within GC and FLT environments (Figure 12A). Examination of the GO biological process terms yielded by the individual lists of DEGs showed many similar stress response terms, but these were primarily in the context of genes more highly expressed at the 4d time point (Figure 12B). However, based on the level of significance of the terms, the enrichment of DEGs related to many of these stress responses was enhanced in FLT. In the cases of oxidative stress and cold response sku5 showed this enhancement. However, in some cases, such as the response to desiccation, both genotypes showed a lack of significant term enrichment in FLT. The sku5 roots also showed slightly higher significance of enrichment of DEGs associated with responses to water deprivation and light stimuli in early FLT development, compared to WS. GO terms related to cell wall remodeling and immune responses, commonly seen in FLT acclimation, were also enhanced in their enrichment during FLT development of sku5 compared to GC development. The remainder of the significant GO terms were unique to one context, and among these is the response to karrikin, which was previously seen in the context of spr1 and Col-0 FLT vs. GC comparisons (Figure 6B). Of the terms enriched specifically in sku5 FLT development, processes involved with salt and ROS stress, as well as light responses, were significantly higher at 4d. At 8d, the terms associated with sku5 in FLT were primarily focused on cell wall remodeling and biosynthetic processes. FIGURE 12.

Data are based on four biological replicates.Discussion The discovery that root skewing was not gravity-dependent, and prevalent in both light-grown and dark-grown plants in spaceflight habitats (Millar et al., 2011; Paul et al., 2012a; Nakashima et al., 2014), invited questions about the underlying mechanisms of this behavior in the microgravity environment and the relationship between those mechanisms and physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The experiments described here examined the contribution of two well-characterized skewing genes that are in two different ecotypic backgrounds and which affect different skewing control pathways. SPIRAL1 plays a role in directional cell expansion by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics (Furutani et al., 2000; Nakajima et al., 2004; Sedbrook et al., 2004; Galva et al., 2014). SKU5 is a skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall and plasma membrane protein, which has also been implicated in stress response signaling (Sedbrook et al., 2002). The sku5 and spr1 mutants are well characterized in terrestrial environments, skewing rightward and leftward, respectively, when grown vertically (Furutani et al., 2000; Sedbrook et al., 2002, 2004; Nakajima et al., 2004). The experimental readouts used to assess the physiological adjustment of seedlings to spaceflight were root and germination measurements, and the differences in transcriptomic responses among the genotypes. The opposing directions of the skewing phenotypes of the mutant lines are believed to stem from alterations of distinct cellular processes, and this is most clearly evidenced by the differential effects of microtubule-destabilizing agents on these mutants (Furutani et al., 2000; Sedbrook et al., 2002, 2004; Nakajima et al., 2004; Galva et al., 2014). The distinct roles of these two genes in determining root directionality is supported by their different individual responses to spaceflight in the present experiments. The data from sku5 and spiral1 are analyzed in context with their parent genotype, WS and Col-0 respectively, as WS shows a much smaller number of spaceflight differentially expressed genes than Col-0 (Paul et al., 2017, and Figures 4, 12). Spr1 Skews Leftward on Earth and Moreso in Space Terrestrial studies concluded that SPR1 reinforces rightward root growth by affecting the balance of thigmotropism and gravitropism (Galva et al., 2014). Morphological data from APEX-03-2 support this notion. At the 4d time point, spr1 seedlings showed a consistent leftward skewing phenotype on Earth, and the leftward skewing was substantially enhanced by spaceflight (Figures 2C, 3B,F). However, spr1 and Col-0 roots were the same length in spaceflight, indicating that the role of SPR1 lies in directionality rather than overall root length in spaceflight (Figure 2A). These data suggest that in the absence of gravitropism during spaceflight, thigmotropism plays a dominant role in growth directionality and that SPR1 acts to positively enhance skewing while not affecting root length in spaceflight. The spaceflight effect of spr1 lies in morphology management rather than growth management. SPR1 binds with another microtubule plus-end tracking protein, EB1b (Galva et al., 2014). It has been postulated that EB1b and SPR1 work in concert to regulate mechanical force-based directional growth with a balance of gravitropism and thigmotropism, where SPR1 participates in the reinforcement of rightward growth through thigmotropic processes, while EB1b negatively regulates thigmotropism and positively regulates gravitropism (Galva et al., 2014). In an environment lacking a gravity cue such as spaceflight, this gravitropic reinforcement has no effect, resulting in the enhanced skewing of spr1. Similarly elevated leftward skewing of spr1 occurs under cold conditions alongside alterations of the microtubule network, and skewing is conversely suppressed by heat or salt treatments (Furutani et al., 2000; Sedbrook et al., 2004). The elevated skewing seen in spr1 may therefore be the result of spaceflight-induced signals in the root which are similar to those involved in cold response signaling. The microtubule-associated protein MAP65-1 is more abundant in spaceflight, and is also hypothesized to be linked to cold-responsive microtubule stabilization (Chen et al., 2016; Soga et al., 2018). Actin cytoskeleton mutants also exhibit a greater degree of skewing in microgravity when compared to wild-type and GC plants, though this skewing occurs to the right when regarded from behind the media (Nakashima et al., 2014). These structural systems both appear to have roles in suppressing endogenous root skewing patterns in spaceflight. The spaceflight-enhanced skewing of spr1 may therefore be attributed to its altered microtubule dynamics in the spaceflight response, similar to altered dynamics induced by terrestrial cold stress. Sku5 Skews Inappropriately in Spaceflight The sku5 mutant did not show an enhancement of skewing in spaceflight as compared to the GC, nor did sku5 respond to the spaceflight environment in the same manner as it does to terrestrial disruption of the gravity vector (Figure 2C) (Sedbrook et al., 2002). However, sku5 and WS roots were the same length in spaceflight, indicating that the role of SKU5 also lies in directionality rather than overall root length in spaceflight (Figure 2B). These data suggest that SKU5, like SPR1, regulates morphology and directionality rather than growth. However, SKU5 regulation is very different from SPR1 regulation of skewing morphology in that lack of SKU5 function prevents appropriate skewing in spaceflight. This prevention of skewing, the sku5 interruption of the pathways involved in skewing, leads to dramatic changes in differential expression of genes for physiological adaptation to spaceflight.Differential Gene Expression as a Measure of the Quantity and Character of the Physiological Adaptation to Spaceflight Differential gene expression profiles reveal the underlying gene expression changes needed for physiological adaptation to environmental changes. There are numerous, well-documented environmentally-induced gene expression profiles in plants, all of which detail specific physiological changes related to the specific stresses. The intensity of the differential gene expression response, in terms of the number of genes involved and their fold-change levels, may be considered a measure of the metabolic cost of adapting to that environment. A terrestrial example of this metabolic cost is in the transcriptomic response to cold stress in Arabidopsis lines that are either sensitive or resistant to cold (Chan et al., 2016). Plants that overexpressed RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION 4 (RDM4) had a cold-tolerant phenotype, and exhibited a greatly reduced transcriptomic response to cold stress compared to the more cold-sensitive wild-type and rdm4 knock-out plants (Chan et al., 2016). The plants that were least able to tolerate cold environments displayed a far higher number (up to 100×) of differentially expressed genes in response to cold than the cold-tolerant plants exposed to the same environment (Chan et al., 2016). Spr1 adapts to spaceflight with far fewer DEGs than Col-0. This suggests that mutation of the SPR1 skewing pathway enhances spaceflight physiological adaptation. In contrast, the sku5 mutation results in a doubling of DEGs in response to spaceflight, and many of those DEGs are members of strong environmental stress responses. This strong response suggests that the SKU5 pathway plays a key role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. Sku5 Mutation Produces a Dramatic Increase in Differential Gene Expression in Spaceflight Sku5 showed a dramatic program of differential gene expression compared to the GCs, a program that was more pronounced and diverse than that of spr1. Many of the genes that are significantly differentially expressed between spaceflight and GCs are associated with skewing and cell wall remodeling, irrespective of intensity of skewing phenotype in the spaceflight-grown plants (Figure 13). FIGURE 13. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed genes between FLT and GC of particular interest. Statistically significant DEGs with greater than twofold magnitude in at least one context. Each gene in this list corresponded to the following categories: potential and highly probable skew gene candidates (Skewing, HPSGC; Schultz et al., 2017), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA; Hundertmark and Hincha, 2008), associated with gravitropism (GO Terms; Carbon et al., 2008), and abscisic acid (ABA, GO Terms; Carbon et al., 2008).

Data are based on four biological replicates.One of the unique aspects of the sku5 spaceflight differential gene expression program involved genes usually associated with dehydration and ABA signaling. The FLT sku5 expression patterns of LEAs and other ABA-associated genes suggest a spaceflight adaptation phenomenon involving, but not limited to, an altered ABA sensitivity in these plants. Many of the highest magnitude DEGs in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 were in the LEA family, primarily dehydrins and group-4 LEAs; many of these genes were induced by greater than 30-fold [Log2(5)] (Figure 13). LEAs are responsive to ABA signaling resulting from osmotic, cold, and drought stresses and act to enhance stress resistance through membrane stabilization, sequestration of ROS, and prevention of protein aggregation (Hundertmark and Hincha, 2008; Zhao et al., 2011; Candat et al., 2014; Fang and Xiong, 2015; Suzuki et al., 2016). Many of the DEGs and LEAs upregulated in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 are associated with embryonic programs that are adjusted at the chromatin level during germination in response to environmental factors (Tai et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2012; Molitor et al., 2014). DOG1, for example, increases in expression in cold temperatures, acting to repress germination during those unfavorable conditions (Footitt et al., 2013, 2014). The sku5 DEGs HAI2 and HAI3 are involved in regulating ABA signaling and responding to soil water potential (Bhaskara et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013). REDUCED DORMANCY 5 also acts to inhibit germination, but functions independently of DOG1 and ABA signaling pathways (Xiang et al., 2014). The GO term enrichments for sku5 also support this, as DEGs associated with dormancy regulation are overrepresented in the dataset (Figures 10B, 12B). It is important to note that SKU5 is expressed in floral tissue (Sedbrook et al., 2002). This altered ABA signaling in sku5 could therefore be attributed to downstream effects of altered seed development. In support of these interpretations, germination rates were repressed in FLT sku5 (Figures 8F,H) relative to GC sku5 (Figures 8B,D), and to FLT WS (Figures 8E,G), as evidenced by counts of ungerminated seeds in the harvest images (Supplementary Table S2). While spr1 is also expressed in reproductive tissues, the differential expression of dormancy signaling genes was not prevalent in the Col-0 and spr1 comparisons (Nakajima et al., 2004; Sedbrook et al., 2004). In fact, those few DEGs related to ABA signaling observed in Col-0 and spr1 displayed a trend in expression that was opposite of what was seen in FLT sku5. As a prime example, the LEA ABA-RESPONSE PROTEIN (ABR) was only slightly downregulated in the spaceflight acclimation of 8d spr1. ABA-related dormancy signaling may be affected by the spaceflight environment. Differential expression patterns also indicate that sku5 mutants experience changes in the plasma membrane during spaceflight. Alterations in plasma membrane dynamics and composition occur in plant responses to terrestrial stressors (e.g., cold stress) and in the response of Chlorella vulgaris to spaceflight (Popova et al., 1989; Solanke and Sharma, 2008; Kazemi-Shahandashti and Maali-Amiri, 2018). Roots of Pisum sativum grown under clinorotation also show shifts in membrane composition in sterol-enriched membrane domains known as “lipid rafts” (Kordyum et al., 2018). Membrane-bound GPI-APs, such as SKU5, localize to these lipid raft nanodomains and are important to stress acclimation, including spaceflight-associated stress (Minami et al., 2008; Mazars et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015; Takahashi et al., 2016, 2019; Yeats et al., 2018). ABA signaling proteins also localize to these membrane domains in a sterol-dependent manner (Demir et al., 2013). Given that sku5 shows alterations of ABA signaling pathways in spaceflight (Figure 13), it can be hypothesized that the lack of SKU5 may affect the function of these nanodomain-localized ABA signaling processes under stress conditions. The expression of a chloroplastic aldehyde reductase, ChlADR (AT1G54870), involved in the detoxification of reactive carbonyls formed as a result of lipid peroxidation, and TSPO, which participates in mobilization of lipids, are induced by stress and highly induced in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 (Guillaumot et al., 2009; Yamauchi et al., 2011; Jurkiewicz et al., 2018). These patterns match the gene expression trends of the spaceflight-induced LEA family genes that are thought to directly participate in membrane stabilization under stress (Battaglia et al., 2008; Hundertmark and Hincha, 2008; Candat et al., 2014). The gene expression patterns of these ABA-responsive genes in sku5 suggest that SKU5 affects ABA signaling in response to stresses. Furthermore, this shows that pathways affecting membrane stabilization and remodeling are required for the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 that are not essential for its growth in terrestrial environments. SKU5 may also directly participate in stress response signaling or cellular remodeling due to its localization to the outer aspects of the plasma membrane. A SKU5 homolog is highly upregulated [Log2(14)] in tobacco overexpressing a FATTY ACID DESATURASE 3 (CbFAD3-OE) homolog derived from the cryophyte Chorispora bungeana when compared to a wild-type line in the response to salt stress (Shi et al., 2018). CbFAD3-OE lines exhibited enhanced membrane fluidity and survival under cold, salt, and drought stresses, and demonstrated reduced lipid peroxidation and membrane leakage via activation of calcium signaling and suppression of ROS (Shi et al., 2018). As such, the sku5 line may require alternative pathways to be activated to maintain membrane fluidity and integrity during spaceflight acclimation due to the removal of SKU5 from this response pathway. The transcriptomic response of sku5 to the spaceflight condition was elevated compared to WS, which would support the activation of additional pathways (Figures 10A, 11A). ROS-related genes are abundant in spaceflight transcriptomes, and reflect a response to spaceflight that is conserved among Arabidopsis cultivars and related species (Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015; Sng et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). Our findings were consistent with this trend across genotypes and the skewing mutants based on GO term enrichments associated with the spaceflight response (Figures 6B, 11B). Notably, sku5 FLT showed elevated expression of genes required to be expressed in response to ROS at the 4d when compared to FLT WS (Figures 9B, 10B), supporting this hypothesized function of SKU5 in this membrane-associated ROS suppression. While FAD3 was not among the sku5 FLT DEGs, FLORAL TRANSITION AT THE MERISTEM1 (FTM1), which catalyzes the desaturation of stearic acid to oleic acid upstream of FAD3, was upregulated in WS and spr1 spaceflight acclimation, and downregulated in that of Col-0 and sku5. FTM1 participates alongside FAD3 in the mediation of stresses associated with Arabidopsis crown gall development through their enrichment with C18:3 fatty acids (Klinkenberg et al., 2014). The increase of C18:3 class of fatty acids also correlated with the enhanced membrane stability measures in the CbFAD3-OE lines (Shi et al., 2018). These results therefore suggest a role for SKU5 in stress metabolism with respect to the plasma membrane, a role that was not revealed in previous ground experiments. An additional explanation for the altered spaceflight response of sku5 comes from its likely association with auxin metabolism and signaling upstream of the plant TOR complex. A SKU5 homolog in maize encodes an interactor of AUXIN-BINDNG PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) (Shimomura, 2006). The abp1 mutant demonstrates a leftward-skewing phenotype opposite to that seen in sku5 (Sedbrook et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2015). Auxin gradients are still present in spaceflight root tips despite the lack of a gravity cue in the spaceflight environment (Ferl and Paul, 2016). The presence of SKU5 acting to mediate anisotropic cell growth in response to endogenous auxin gradients could facilitate the spaceflight acclimation of wild-type seedlings. GO terms associated with the DEGs of 4d spaceflight response of sku5 suggested this connection as well, with many alterations occurring in signaling pathways related to ethylene, ROS, and light signaling (Figure 11B). Furthermore, ABP1 is associated with the activation of TOR and the promotion of growth through the action of an auxin-activated signaling pathway mediated by the RHO OF PLANTS 2 (ROP2) GTPase (Xu et al., 2014; Schepetilnikov et al., 2017; Ryabova et al., 2019). The TOR complex integrates diverse environmental signals to regulate growth, and ABA signaling inhibits TOR, promoting autophagy to allow for stress tolerance acquisition (Ryabova et al., 2019; Signorelli et al., 2019). SKU5 may impact this mechanism indirectly through affecting the action of ABP1, and a reduction of the auxin signaling into TOR would shift the balance in favor of stronger ABA responses, such as that seen in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5. A ROP6 pathway also mediated by ABP1 affects the activity of KATANIN, which severs cortical microtubules to facilitate reorganization of the microtubule network in response to environmental stimuli (Chen et al., 2016). As a result, the spr1 mutant may be faster to form a spaceflight-tolerant microtubule network due to its altered microtubule kinetics, while the sku5 mutant may not be able to perform this function as rapidly due to altered ABP1 signaling. Spr1 Mutation Produces a Decrease in Differential Gene Expression in Spaceflight The spaceflight DEGs of spr1 and Col-0 were primarily in the defense and salicylic acid-mediated signaling related to cell wall remodeling (Figures 5B, 6B). Genes related to these cell wall pathways are common in spaceflight transcriptomes (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Correll et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017). While plants grown in microgravity may be more susceptible to pathogenic infection (Leach et al., 2001; Ryba-White et al., 2001), the fact that all examples to date of upregulated pathogen response genes are from plants grown in sterile conditions suggests that these genes are serving other purposes of cell wall remodeling in spaceflight (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Correll et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2019). ALD1 is a positive regulator of salicylic acid accumulation pathways through the generation of metabolites (Nie et al., 2011; Cecchini et al., 2015). NIMIN1 and DLO1 contribute to opposing processes, acting to repress immune responses at the level of expression regulation (Kohler et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2013; Zeilmaker et al., 2015). Salicylic acid induces the lipid raft-localized pathways induced by ABA, in order to promote cellular uptake of water (Demir et al., 2013; Prodhan et al., 2018). The upregulation of salicylic acid signaling in spr1 may act through these pathways, promoting abiotic stress response through pathways normally associated with defense responses (Figures 5B, 6B). This hypothesis might also explain why the induction of “defense” and wound response pathways occurs in spaceflight in the absence of pathogenic infections (Nejat and Mantri, 2017). The recently characterized ORBITALLY MANIFESTED GENE 1, a regulator of ROS signaling that is both flg22- and wound-inducible, provides a spaceflight-relevant example (Sng et al., 2018). Considering that wounding and pathogen invasion also mechanically disrupt membranes and cell walls (Chen et al., 2016), these pathways may be signaling remodeling of cellular structures and the microtubule network in spaceflight. Flg22 application to Arabidopsis cell cultures and induction of MAMP-triggered immunity also has the effect of redistributing flavonoid compounds from biosynthetic processes important to oxidative stress response processes to the production of compounds important to defense (Schenke et al., 2019). Genes associated with the production of phenylpropanoids are less-represented among the spr1 DEGs downregulated in spaceflight compared to Col-0, although they are also more highly represented among spr1 DEGs downregulated across development in spaceflight (Figures 6B, 7B). As such, these DEGs negatively regulating defense signaling in spr1 may contribute to an enhanced ability to mediate ROS generated in spaceflight through the redistribution of limited resources early in its development. This conclusion is also supported by the gene categories enriched in the spaceflight acclimations of Col-0 and spr1, where DEGs associated with responses to oxidative stress are more enriched among genes upregulated in FLT in spr1 than in Col-0 (Figure 6B). Many abiotic stresses trigger remodeling of cortical microtubules, with salt stress tolerance requiring the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of SPR1 (Shoji et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2016). Microtubule reorientation also contributes to cell elongation in the spaceflight response of hypocotyls (Soga et al., 2018). The spr1 mutant, which has altered microtubule dynamics in favor of decreased stability, may have enhanced capabilities for remodeling of microtubule networks in the response to many forms of environmental stress (Galva et al., 2014). Spr1 and Sku5 Mutants Both Differentially Regulate Skewing-Associated Genes in Response to Spaceflight Despite the many differing spaceflight responses of spr1 and sku5, DEGs identified as likely to be associated with the integrative signaling of skewing (Schultz et al., 2017) were among those differentially expressed in both mutants in spaceflight (Figure 13). Two of the highly likely skewing genes, SENESCENCE 1 (SEN1) and ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE 1 (ASN1) are induced in spaceflight (Figure 13). The SKU5 protein is endocytosed through different pathways within the root tip dependent on local auxin signals and perceived stress conditions (Baral et al., 2015). SKU5 could act to modulate growth regulation through its aforementioned association with the ABP1 apoplastic signaling pathway upstream of TOR, and both SKU5 and SPR1 can affect microtubule reorganizing pathways. This would enable SKU5 to impact the spaceflight response via the regulation of meristematic competence and cell cycle progression, processes that are affected in spaceflight (Matía et al., 2010), clinorotation, RPM exposure, and magnetic levitation (Herranz and Medina, 2014; Herranz et al., 2014; Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., 2016). This is supported by the M-phase peak of SKU5 expression and its previously hypothesized role in regulating the cell cycle (Menges et al., 2002; Sedbrook et al., 2002). However, the importance of senescence in the context of root skewing has not been well-studied. The recent association of strigolactone-independent karrikin-sensing pathways with skewing provides a potential direction for study (Swarbreck et al., 2019). The loss of the protein MORE AXILLARY BRANCHES 2 (MAX2), which also participates in strigolactone-associated senescence signaling, exacerbates the skewing phenotype of sku5 in a sku5 max2 line (Ueda and Kusaba, 2015; Swarbreck et al., 2019). Therefore, these results reinforce connections between environmental and senescence signaling and root skewing. The association of skewing-associated genes with these regulatory networks provide a means by which the mutation of these genes can alter the response to the spaceflight condition.Conclusion The physiological adaptation of sku5 to spaceflight is characterized by powerful stress responses, as well as the strong induction of LEAs and other genes associated with seed development. In contrast to sku5, spr1 differentially expressed fewer genes than Col-0 to physiologically adapt to spaceflight. This observation suggests that the spr1 mutation imbued an enhanced ability for rapid spaceflight acclimation while sku5 required an extended spaceflight response to accomplish acclimation, even to the point of initiating classic deep stress responses. These observations further suggest that the functional distinctions between sku5 and spr1 inform distinct aspects of the spaceflight response in plants, in particular the responses of young seedlings. The dramatic responses of sku5 suggest that lipid raft nanodomains of the plasma membrane and their associated GPI-APs play important roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The fact that sku5 and spr1 show markedly different gene expression patterns in spaceflight suggests that the two skewing pathways highlighted by SKU5 and SPR1 differentially affect the mechanisms used by plants to physiologically acclimate to spaceflight. Since spr1 and sku5 root lengths are not altered by spaceflight, the effects of these mutations lie not in the process of growth, but in the processes that direct morphology and structure, likely tying together the large number of cell wall remodeling genes observed as differentially expressed in spaceflight. The data from APEX-03-2 therefore provide an initial functional dissection of the spaceflight response in roots, one that allows an integration of pathways associated with root directionality, morphology and physiological responses to spaceflight.Data Availability Statement The datasets generated and analyzed, composed of the RNA-Seq data and full output of the differential gene expression pipeline, for this study can be found in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO – https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the accessions GSE95620 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?&acc=GSE95620) and GSE95582 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE95582), and also in NASA’s GeneLab Database (GLDS-218).

    "abstract": "Abstract The effects of spaceflight on cartilaginous structure are largely unknown. To address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological changes. The flight AC showed some evidence of degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. These data suggest that degradative changes are underway in the AC extracellular matrix exposed to microgravity. In contrast, there was no evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC flight samples and the gene expression profile was distinct from that of AC with a reduction in metalloproteinase gene transcription. Since the two cartilages respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned to the biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained. That is, the differences between magnitude of normal terrestrial loading and the unloading of microgravity dictates the tissue response. Weight-bearing articular cartilage, but not minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage, is negatively affected by the unloading of microgravity. We speculate that the maintenance of physiological loading on AC during spaceflight will minimize AC damage.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The major load-bearing tissue within the joint is articular cartilage (AC). AC is exquisitely sensitive to changes in biomechanical loading (reviewed by Sanchez-Adams et al.1). Under normal conditions, chondrocytes synthesize a balance of extracellular matrix (ECM) components so that the ability to resist tensile and compressive forces is maintained. Deviation from the normal range of biomechanical forces,2–5 including complete unloading,6–8 tips the balance from maintenance to pathology typically leading to cartilage erosion and later osteoarthritis. While the effects of the biomechanical unloading environment of spaceflight on bone and skeletal muscle are well-studied,9,10 the effects on AC are largely unknown. The responses of AC to microgravity are important to define because it is clear from clinical studies that load-bearing AC is different from bone and skeletal tissue in that has a very poor capacity to restore damaged tissue.11 Consequently, microgravity-induced joint pathology could compromise flight crew mobility, interfere with mission activities, and accelerate short- and long-term joint degradation in flight personnel. To investigate the effect of extended microgravity on AC, joint tissue from mice exposed to 30 days of Spaceflight in the BION-M1 flight was assessed for evidence of cartilage degradation. Our data suggest that spaceflight results in tissue degradation in load-bearing AC, but not in minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage.",
    "methods": "Methods Animals C57BL/6N male mice were flown for 30 days (477 Earth orbits) on the unmanned BION-M1 biosatellite between 19 April and 19 May 2013.20 Tissues were acquired from six male flight mice as part of NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program. The mice were specific pathogen-free and 19–20 weeks old at the time of launch and start of control experiments. In addition to the six flight mice (SF), there were eight “flight” vivarium male ground control mice (SFV), seven asynchronous ground control males (GC), and seven asynchronous vivarium ground control males (GCV). Tissues were harvested 12–13 h post-landing. Flight and animal habitat details for the BION-M1 mission have been reported by Andreev-Andrievskiy et al.20 IACUC approval was obtained from the MSU Institute of Mitoengineering and of the Biomedical Ethics Commission of IBMP and the study was conducted in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific purposes. Tissue analyses Hindlimbs and elbow joints were dissected and right limbs placed in RNALater (Ambion) with left limbs placed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF). Sternae with ribs attached were cut mid-sternum and the posterior half containing xiphoid process and two sternocostal joints placed in RNALater and the anterior half placed in NBF for histology. AC processing, toluidine blue histology and immunohistochemistry, were performed as previously reported.21 AC sections were stained for Safranin-O (Saf-O) and counterstained with hematoxylin using a protocol from the University of Rochester, Center for Musculoskeletal Research (https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/musculoskeletal-research/core-services/histology/protocols.aspx). Cartilage thickness measurements were taken along the tibial and femoral articular surfaces of Saf-O positive AC at 30 different sites for each section in the same relative position throughout the joint and included calcified and non-calcified regions together. These within-animal measurements were used to derive an average thickness for each animal. The thickness variation within an experimental group was similar to the average variation within individual samples (not shown). For transmission electron microscopy, cartilage samples from SF and GC elbows were dissected from bone and post-fixed in 0.5% (v/v) osmiumtetroxide and 1% (w/v) potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. After dehydration, specimens were incubated in propylenoxide and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut, collected on copper grids, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were taken at 60 kV with a Phillips EM-410 electron microscope (Ditabis, Pforzheim, Germany). RNA analyses RNALater-preserved AC from the femoral condyle and proximal tibia was dissected down to the calcified zone using an ophthalmic scalpel and tissue from SF and GC animals pooled separately. Half sternum pieces were dissected from ribs and SC dissected from bony segments and pooled. RNA was isolated using the MirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) and amplified by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. Samples (100 ng) were then labeled using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Plus protocol and hybridized to an Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST GeneChip. Analysis of microarray data was conducted using both Microarray Suite (MAS) version 5.0 and Robust Multi-Array Average (RMA).22 Differentially expressed genes were ≥−2 (decrease) or a fold change of ≥2 (increase) with an FDR of 0.05. Statistical analyses For the AC histological scoring analysis, measurements were taken from seven GC, seven GCV, five SF, and six SFV samples where good joint histology in the correct plane was obtained. Histology scoring for SC was conducted on six SF, seven GC, eight SFV, and seven GCV animals. Each animal received a single histology score representing the sum of separate histological parameters shown in Supplementary Table 1 with higher scores representing more overall cartilage degradation. Statistical differences between experimental groups (GC, GCV, SF, SFV) for total histological scores from each animal were examined using the Kruskal–Wallis test for multiple independent samples (http://astatsa.com/KruskalWallisTest/).23 The omnibus P-value of 0.006 (d.f. = 3) rejects the null hypothesis that all groups have the same distribution. Post-hoc pairwise multiple testing by Dunn was used to determine which pairs are different.24 P-values were adjusted according to the family-wide error rate of Holm and then by the Benjamini–Hochberg method.25 P-values for all pairwise comparisons used to calculate overall Kruskal–Wallis P-values are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Median, maximum score, minimum score, and 25th and 75th percentile of total histology data plotted for each experimental group are shown in Fig. 1d.

    "results": "Results Articular cartilage Spaceflight (SF) AC samples demonstrated less proteoglycan compared to AC ground controls (GC) (Fig. 1a). Decreased proteoglycan levels were generally restricted to the femoral condyle rather than the tibial plateau. Analysis of the boxed regions drawn around areas of reduced proteoglycan staining indicates approximately 35% of chondrocytes within the box stain for pericellular proteoglycan. Virtually no superficial zone chondrocytes have pericellular staining with the majority of toluidine blue-stained cells residing in the middle zone. Collagen II levels were similar between SF and control samples although three SF samples showed evidence of surface damage (Fig. 1b). In addition, clear evidence of osteophyte formation was present in three SF samples and in one GC and one SFV control sample (Fig. 1c). One SF femur sample was <2/3 the thickness of the average GC thickness. The SF mice had a significantly worse overall histological scores compared to all of the non-flight control groups, suggesting more overall cartilage degradation (Fig. 1d). Electron microscopy analysis of AC of elbows revealed no major differences in matrix density between SF and GC samples (Supplementary Fig. 1). Gene expression analysis showed several sustained changes in gene activation in SF compared to GC samples. Ten genes were upregulated and 37 genes downregulated greater than two-fold in flight compared to ground with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 (Fig. 2a). Seventeen of the altered genes are structural cartilage ECM proteins or proteins associated with joint pathology. Fig. 1.

In contrast to AC, there was no difference in extent and overall levels of proteoglycan staining between SF and GC samples in the sternal cartilage (SC), indicating no microgravity-induced proteoglycan decrease. Gene expression analyses demonstrated that 30 sternal genes were upregulated and 35 were downregulated in SF compared to GC (Fig. 2b).",
    "discussion": "Discussion The finding of reduced proteoglycan levels in AC due to microgravity is consistent with hindlimb unloading and limb immobilization studies in rodents, dogs, and rabbits, which consistently report unloading-specific AC atrophy in multiple experimental situations (reviewed in ref. 8). Our data suggest that despite partial proteoglycan reduction, the collagen II network remains intact. While surface damage and osteophytes were noted in several SF animals, there was no evidence of widespread AC fibrillation or fissure formation, and we conclude that exposure to microgravity results in moderate surface damage. Some chondrocytes were stained strongly for proteoglycan immediately surrounding the cell and may represent the production of new proteoglycan in the time elapsed (12–13 h) since returning to normal gravity although glycosaminoglycan synthesis assays are needed to confirm this. Nine of the downregulated genes in spaceflight encode structural ECM components, including fibromodulin (fmod), osteoglycin (Ogn), osteomodulin (Omd), decorin (Dcn), dermatopontin (Dpt), PRELP (Prelp) collagen X (Col10a1), thrombospondin4 (Tsp4), and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). Several other non-structural components with important cartilage ECM roles in development or osteoarthritis were also downregulated, including proteoglycan-related gene 4/lubricin (Prg4), procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 2 (Pcolce2), and Cytokine-like 1 (Cytl1). Cytl1 is an autocrine factor that regulates chondrogenesis in mesenchymal cells12 and is required for cartilage homeostasis.13 Expression of Prg4 by superficial zone chondrocytes is acutely mechanosensitive; upregulation occurs with loading and associated with protection against osteoarthritis.14–17 The decrease in proteoglycan levels and downregulation of ECM molecules and genes that protect against osteoarthritic changes suggest that the early stages of cartilage breakdown are underway in the flight AC after 30 days of microgravity. However, since there is no evidence of significant collagen II degradation and the possible re-synthesis of proteoglycan in some chondrocytes, we suggest that cartilage recovery is possible and that 30 days of microgravity is insufficient for irreversible cartilage degradation. In SC, there was no evidence of proteoglycan loss and a different suite of genes was altered in spaceflight. Of the downregulated genes, most notable were two prominent cartilage ECM-degrading enzymes: Mmp13 and Mmp9. This finding together with the downregulation of S100a8 and S100a9, which are known to stimulate Mmp gene activation in cartilage,18 suggest that less ECM proteolysis occurs in SF samples compared to non-flight samples in SC tissue. The expression of several genes was altered in both cartilage tissues, including Prg4 and Omd, but opposite directions in the two cartilages. Osteomodulin regulates fibril diameter and is suggestive of new matrix synthesis in SC and reduced matrix production in AC.19 Prg4 is chondroprotective and its upregulation in SC is further evidence that SC may be protected from degradation in microgravity. Based on these differences in response to microgravity between the two cartilages, we suggest that the relative change in biomechanical environment determines the tissue response. During normal activities, AC is cyclically loaded with a significant fraction of body weight and then almost completely unloaded in microgravity. This change in loading triggers cartilage breakdown. In contrast, SC is loaded by cyclical lung expansion but does not experience the same magnitude of compressive loading as AC. Since the mice continue to breathe in microgravity and continuously load the tissue, the difference between mechanical loading in SF and controls is minimal, and cartilage breakdown is not initiated in SC. Taken together, our findings suggest that maintenance of biomechanical loading during spaceflight will minimize AC destruction.",

The expression of several genes was altered in both cartilage tissues, including Prg4 and Omd, but opposite directions in the two cartilages. Osteomodulin regulates fibril diameter and is suggestive of new matrix synthesis in SC and reduced matrix production in AC.19 Prg4 is chondroprotective and its upregulation in SC is further evidence that SC may be protected from degradation in microgravity. Based on these differences in response to microgravity between the two cartilages, we suggest that the relative change in biomechanical environment determines the tissue response. During normal activities, AC is cyclically loaded with a significant fraction of body weight and then almost completely unloaded in microgravity. This change in loading triggers cartilage breakdown. In contrast, SC is loaded by cyclical lung expansion but does not experience the same magnitude of compressive loading as AC. Since the mice continue to breathe in microgravity and continuously load the tissue, the difference between mechanical loading in SF and controls is minimal, and cartilage breakdown is not initiated in SC. Taken together, our findings suggest that maintenance of biomechanical loading during spaceflight will minimize AC destruction.Methods Animals C57BL/6N male mice were flown for 30 days (477 Earth orbits) on the unmanned BION-M1 biosatellite between 19 April and 19 May 2013.20 Tissues were acquired from six male flight mice as part of NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program. The mice were specific pathogen-free and 19–20 weeks old at the time of launch and start of control experiments. In addition to the six flight mice (SF), there were eight “flight” vivarium male ground control mice (SFV), seven asynchronous ground control males (GC), and seven asynchronous vivarium ground control males (GCV). Tissues were harvested 12–13 h post-landing. Flight and animal habitat details for the BION-M1 mission have been reported by Andreev-Andrievskiy et al.20 IACUC approval was obtained from the MSU Institute of Mitoengineering and of the Biomedical Ethics Commission of IBMP and the study was conducted in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific purposes.Tissue analyses Hindlimbs and elbow joints were dissected and right limbs placed in RNALater (Ambion) with left limbs placed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF). Sternae with ribs attached were cut mid-sternum and the posterior half containing xiphoid process and two sternocostal joints placed in RNALater and the anterior half placed in NBF for histology. AC processing, toluidine blue histology and immunohistochemistry, were performed as previously reported.21 AC sections were stained for Safranin-O (Saf-O) and counterstained with hematoxylin using a protocol from the University of Rochester, Center for Musculoskeletal Research (https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/musculoskeletal-research/core-services/histology/protocols.aspx). Cartilage thickness measurements were taken along the tibial and femoral articular surfaces of Saf-O positive AC at 30 different sites for each section in the same relative position throughout the joint and included calcified and non-calcified regions together. These within-animal measurements were used to derive an average thickness for each animal. The thickness variation within an experimental group was similar to the average variation within individual samples (not shown). For transmission electron microscopy, cartilage samples from SF and GC elbows were dissected from bone and post-fixed in 0.5% (v/v) osmiumtetroxide and 1% (w/v) potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. After dehydration, specimens were incubated in propylenoxide and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut, collected on copper grids, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were taken at 60 kV with a Phillips EM-410 electron microscope (Ditabis, Pforzheim, Germany).RNA analyses RNALater-preserved AC from the femoral condyle and proximal tibia was dissected down to the calcified zone using an ophthalmic scalpel and tissue from SF and GC animals pooled separately. Half sternum pieces were dissected from ribs and SC dissected from bony segments and pooled. RNA was isolated using the MirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) and amplified by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. Samples (100 ng) were then labeled using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Plus protocol and hybridized to an Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST GeneChip. Analysis of microarray data was conducted using both Microarray Suite (MAS) version 5.0 and Robust Multi-Array Average (RMA).22 Differentially expressed genes were ≥−2 (decrease) or a fold change of ≥2 (increase) with an FDR of 0.05.Statistical analyses For the AC histological scoring analysis, measurements were taken from seven GC, seven GCV, five SF, and six SFV samples where good joint histology in the correct plane was obtained. Histology scoring for SC was conducted on six SF, seven GC, eight SFV, and seven GCV animals. Each animal received a single histology score representing the sum of separate histological parameters shown in Supplementary Table 1 with higher scores representing more overall cartilage degradation. Statistical differences between experimental groups (GC, GCV, SF, SFV) for total histological scores from each animal were examined using the Kruskal–Wallis test for multiple independent samples (http://astatsa.com/KruskalWallisTest/).23 The omnibus P-value of 0.006 (d.f. = 3) rejects the null hypothesis that all groups have the same distribution. Post-hoc pairwise multiple testing by Dunn was used to determine which pairs are different.24 P-values were adjusted according to the family-wide error rate of Holm and then by the Benjamini–Hochberg method.25 P-values for all pairwise comparisons used to calculate overall Kruskal–Wallis P-values are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Median, maximum score, minimum score, and 25th and 75th percentile of total histology data plotted for each experimental group are shown in Fig. 1d.Reporting Summary Further information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Material (339.1KB, pdf) Reporting Summary (1.3MB, pdf) Acknowledgements Microarray assays and data analysis were performed by the Gene Profiling Shared Resource at Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Spaceflight impacts all living organisms from their genome to physiome. Whether it is the reduction in gravity, increased exposure to low dose radiation, chronic elevated CO2 levels or time dislocation, the physical factors associated with the spaceflight environment presents a unique set of stresses on biological systems. Of these physical factors, the reduction in gravity, or microgravity, is one of the most widely studied [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Gravity represents one of the most constant evolutionary drivers of life on Earth [8,9], and understanding how organisms respond to the absence of this ever-present force not only provides information on how gravity has shaped life on Earth, but also provides key insight into potential mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of microgravity during spaceflight. The large-scale physiological effects of microgravity-induced stress on animals and plants are relatively well known. For example, in humans, microgravity conditions result in bone loss, upwards to 3% per month [4,10,11], permutations to both the adaptive and innate immune systems [12], and an increased potential risk of bacterial and viral infections [13,14]. Plants also have an increased susceptibility to pathogenic colonization in microgravity [15], as well as altered rates of cell division, changes in morphological structures of cell tissues, such as root hairs, and induced chromosomal aberrations [16,17,18]. Although these overarching phenotypes associated with microgravity exposure have been observed for decades, ascertaining whether the phenotypes are specific to microgravity or other environmental variables, as well as the underlying etiology of these effects at the cellular and biomolecular level are not yet fully delineated. Compounding our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these physiological effects is the relatively unknown impact of microgravity on the microbiome associated with eukaryotic organisms. A microbiome is typically defined as the sum of the microbes, genomes and community interactions that occur in a particular environment. The term was first applied to humans to understand the ecology of those microbes that interact with the body [19] but has been quickly adopted to represent a holistic approach to understanding the connectivity and interactions within any complex host-microbe association [20]. In humans, the recent human microbiome sequencing project has revealed that the collective metagenome of those microbes that associate with humans dwarfs the size of the human genome and contains a consortia of bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses, the specific contributions of which are not yet fully delineated (Figure 1) [21]. Initial surveys indicate that for every one human gene there are approximately 360 bacterial genes, thereby providing humans with millions of genes of additional metabolisms and cellular activities [22,23]. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Overview of the complexity of human microbiome. Circle size reflects the approximate relative abundance of the various microbes known to associate with humans. Relative gene abundance is derived from the human microbiome sequencing project [19,22]. Question marks reflect uncertainty or potential underestimation of gene abundance. Over the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in our understanding of the importance the microbiome plays in maintaining plant and animal health [22,24]. Aspects previously attributed to the host are now recognized as being the result of interactions with microbes [22,25,26]. For example, analyses of germ-free and normally colonized mice have shown that the gut microbiota is responsible for most of the metabolites found in mammalian blood [27]. Additionally, some species of bacteria within human gut have been recently correlated to the onset of several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Type 1 diabetes [28,29,30,31]; colorectal cancers [32]; and obesity [33] suggesting that perturbations to the gut environment (e.g., antibiotic treatments) can increase the potential risk of disease. However, in many of these same cases, modulations of the gut microbiota and probiotic therapies have been shown to attenuate the condition and treat the host organism [24]. Together, these studies indicate that stable diverse microbial communities and functional gene redundancies can provide resiliency to the host’s microbiota to withstand temporary community disturbances and potentially resist invasion by exogenous pathogenic microbes [24,34]. However, continuous or regular perturbations to the environment, such as exposure to microgravity, may result in loss of biodiversity or extirpation (i.e., the extinction of a species in localized areas of the microbiome), potentially driving the community towards disease. Although the short- and long-term resilience (i.e., susceptibility of community to disturbances or extirpation) of animal and plant microbiomes in response to microgravity is virtually unknown, microbial exchange and transfers do occur between microbiomes during spaceflight [35,36] and there is increasing evidence that microgravity induces physiological and developmental changes within specific host-microbe interactions as discussed below. Assessing the impact of microgravity on a host organism and its microbiota requires a comprehensive analysis that includes the study of both pathogenic and mutualistic bacteria as cultures and in situ to fully understand the requirements needed to maintain host health in the space flight environment.",

Assessing the impact of microgravity on a host organism and its microbiota requires a comprehensive analysis that includes the study of both pathogenic and mutualistic bacteria as cultures and in situ to fully understand the requirements needed to maintain host health in the space flight environment.2. Spaceflight and Simulated Microgravity Environments Experimentally testing the effects of microgravity on host-microbe interactions at the cellular and biomolecular level often requires a two-pronged approach. First, in ideal situations the impact of microgravity on both host and symbiont physiology can be investigated under a high-quality microgravity (10−6 g) environment, such the International Space Station U.S. National Laboratory [5,37]. However, logistics with regard to access to the station, astronaut time, the need for specialized equipment and overall costs can impose limitations on experimental design and reproducibility. A second approach to microgravity research has been the development of Earth-based systems to simulate or model the microgravity environment. Examples include drop towers at various NASA facilities, and parabola flights in aircraft (e.g., Zero-G), which can provide several seconds of microgravity, albeit at a lower quality (10−3 g). A new frontier in microgravity research is the emergence of numerous commercial suborbital companies such as Virgin Galactic, XCOR Aerospace, Blue Origin, and Masten Space Systems that in the next few years will offer lower flight cost, and more frequent and rapid flights rates for microgravity research. Although these alternative approaches may provide up to several minutes of microgravity exposure, other ground-based tools have emerged over the past few decades that can model the low-shear, low-turbulent effects of microgravity over longer periods of time and will be discussed in this review. Two of these technologies, the clinostat and rotating wall vessel (RWV), provide a relatively low cost approach to investigate the cumulative effects of microgravity on both pathogenic and mutualistic microbes [1,4,13,38,39,40,41]. Both technologies facilitate constant rotation that is perpendicular to the gravitational vector thus maintaining the cell cultures in a low shear suspension where the hydrodynamic forces offset gravitational settling, thus enabling the organism to be in a simulated microgravity state [1,39]. Rotating bioreactors can effectively replicate the low shear environments of many parts of the human body where bacteria typically associate, such as the brush-border of epithelial cells, one of the most common sites for host-microbe interactions in animals [42,43]. Although initially the reactors were used for bacterial suspensions, the technology has been successfully adapted to examine more complex aspects of host-microbe interactions. For example, the RWV bioreactors have been used to stimulate the formation of three-dimensional eukaryotic cell cultures that more realistically approximate the function and cellular tissue structure an exogenous microbe might encounter. More recently, RWV bioreactors have been used to look at the impact of microgravity on the colonization of host tissues in situ, where both the host and symbiotic partners are co-incubated within the rotating vessels [41,44,45]. Although the shear forces increase when working with larger organisms in the RWV bioreactors, previous modeling experiments have shown that the fluid shear levels of objects up to 3 mm mimic those typically seen by microbes when they associate with host tissues [46,47].3. Impact of Microgravity on Animal-Microbe Associations 3.1. Pathogenic Interactions with Animals Over the past few decades, numerous studies have examined the effects of both natural and modeled microgravity on pathogenic microbes revealing several pronounced physiological responses [1,7,37,40,44,48,49]. These microgravity-induced changes include: changes in growth rate and higher cell densities; increased membrane integrity [7,45,50,51]; differential secondary metabolite production [52]; elevated transfer rates of genetic material between cells [53,54] and increased biofilm formation [5,6,55,56]. In addition to these basic physiological responses, several well-characterized pathogenic microbes have also exhibited changes at the molecular level by altering expression of genes known to be associated with virulence in microgravity including: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium cultures; Escherichia coli; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [5,57,58,59,60]. In S. typhimurium cultures grown in both space flight and ground-based analog microgravity environments, there was faster colonization of mouse spleen and liver tissues and shortened time-to-death rates [5,57]. This enhanced pathogenicity in S. typhimurium has also been correlated to the overall fitness of the cultures in microgravity, including increased resistance to antibiotics, pH, temperature and osmotic stresses [1,3,37,55]. Transcriptional and proteomic analysis of microgravity-exposed S. typhimurium has revealed the differential expression of numerous genes and proteins associated with stress responses and virulence, such as lipopolysaccharide synthesis enzymes, cell invasion genes, and the global regulator Hfq [5,61,62]. Hfq, a RNA binding protein known to have a diverse role in bacterial physiology [63], has been shown to be essential for S. typhimurium virulence [64] as well as numerous other pathogenic microbes [59,62,65,66]. Of the many genes associated with microgravity exposure, the global Hfq regulator was one of the few differentially expressed genes to be identified in other pathogenic species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus [5,59,62], suggesting it plays a diverse and critical role in mediating the microgravity response in bacteria. Although S. typhimurium clearly exhibited increased virulence in both natural and modeled microgravity, the response was environment-dependent [49]. Altering the inorganic salt concentration of the surrounding media effectively inhibited the enhanced virulence [49] suggesting that it may be possible to mitigate aspects of pathogenicity during space flight. Additionally, recent examination of the ability of several clinical pathogens to infect an animal host in situ, where both organisms were maintained under both space flight and modeled microgravity conditions, showed an overall decrease in virulence [44]. In this study, four diverse pathogens including: Listeria monocytogens, a common food-borne pathogen; Staphylococcus aureus, associated with skin and respiratory infections; Enterococcus faecalis, a prevalent antibiotic resistant species associated with gastrointestinal track; and Candida albicans, a fungus known to associate with skin and mucus membranes, were incubated with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans for up to 48 h and then the host was assessed for viability. The overall decrease in virulence may be the result of basic morphological (i.e., coccoid versus filamentous) or motility differences between the microbial ecotypes that alter the low-shear environment of space flight, thus impacting the ability of the pathogen to colonize and infect host tissues [67]. These results may also simply reflect host-specific or even tissue-specific differential gene expression in response to various pathogens under microgravity conditions. Such studies reinforce the need to fully assess the environmental or community characteristics that predispose or drive host-microbe interactions towards disease.3.2. Mutualistic Interactions with Animals Although disease-causing microbes represent a potential risk to astronauts in microgravity conditions, it is also essential to have a corresponding understanding of mutualistic microbes to learn what drives microbial fitness in the spaceflight environment and how to maintain a healthy homeostasis between humans and their microbiome. To address these issues, one model system has recently emerged to assess the interactions between animal cells and beneficial microbes in situ under microgravity conditions (Figure 2). The binary symbiosis between the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes and its luminescent partner Vibrio fischeri was established over two decades ago as a tractable model for examining beneficial animal-microbe interactions [68,69]. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Impact of microgravity on the developmental time line of mutualistic symbiosis between the squid Euprymna scolopes and bacterial partner Vibrio fischeri.

(F) Exposure to microgravity alters the developmental time line of the symbiosis under normal gravity and modeled microgravity conditions using a RWV bioreactor. Events listed in black do not change under microgravity conditions. Those events in red are delayed during modeled microgravity, where as those events in green are accelerated.The site of symbiosis occurs in the host light organ, located within the squid’s mantle cavity (Figure 2A). The light organ contains a series of superficial invaginations that form long ciliated ducts, which terminate into a series of epithelial lined crypt spaces where the bacteria eventually reside and grow. On the surface of the light organ is a superficial field of epithelial cells overlaying a blood sinus that form two appendage-like structures and are critical for facilitating the initiation of the symbiosis (Figure 2B). Studies have revealed that the colonization and maintenance of the light organ symbiosis is highly specific and requires a complex exchange of signaling molecules and cell–cell communication that is in part mediated by the host immune system [70,71]. One of the initial signals involved in establishing the symbiosis is the use of micro-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) molecules, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and peptidoglycan. Originally characterized in pathogenic associations, LPS and peptidoglycan have been recently shown to be critical for maintaining gut homeostasis in mammals and insects [25,72]. The squid–vibrio symbiosis is initiated when upon hatching from their egg case the squid is exposed to bacteria-rich seawater. Peptidoglycan that is shed from these surrounding microbes induces mucus to be secreted by the surface epithelial appendage cells of the host light organ. The accumulation of mucus selectively enriches V. fischeri from the other surrounding microbes and within 2–3 h after hatching the V. fischeri begins to colonize the light organ by entering pores on the surface of the light organ then migrating through ducts until they reach the crypt spaces. During the colonization of the light organ, the bacteria induce a series of developmental events in the host squid that eventually results in a remodeling of the host light organ structure. One of the first symbiont-induced phenotypes in the host squid is the activation of the host’s innate immune response [69,71,73]. With two hours of exposure to V. fischeri cells, host-derived hemocytes, a macrophage-like cell, are trafficked into the blood sinus of the superficial epithelial cell appendage (Figure 2C). The precise role these host immune cells play in the symbiosis is not well defined, however, it is thought they facilitate the regression of superficial epithelial cells once colonization has been initiated [69]. The regression event is triggered by a bacteria-induced apoptosis event by the synergistic activity of the bacterial MAMP molecules LPS and a derivative of peptidoglycan, tracheal cytotoxin (Figure 2D) [74,75]. The apoptosis event peaks 16 h after exposure to the V. fischeri MAMPS and regression of the epithelial appendages is visible by 24 h and takes approximately 96 h for complete regression (Figure 2E) [76,77,78]. In modeled microgravity conditions, where both partners are co-incubated using RWV bioreactors, the bacteria-induced developmental time line in the host light organ is altered (Figure 2F). One of the first observed differences is that the trafficking of host-derived hemocytes into the light organ blood sinus, which normally occurs within two hours of bacteria exposure, is delayed until 12 h in modeled microgravity [41]. The cause for the delay is not known, but the amount of hemocyte cells in the blood sinus is significantly lower than in gravity controls suggesting that the low-shear, modeled microgravity environment suppresses the activation and transport of hemocytes to the light organ [41]. One potential explanation is that the squid hemocytes proliferation or cytokine signaling may be reduced in microgravity-like conditions. Similar results have been seen in mammalian immune systems during space flight [79,80]. Another key phenotype that changes in the squid–vibrio system during modeled microgravity is the acceleration of the light organ morphogenesis; specifically, the LPS-induced apoptotic cell death event throughout the superficial field of epithelial cells. Normally, the LPS triggered apoptosis event peaks approximately 16 h after bacterial exposure, however, in modeled microgravity it occurs around 8 h after exposure [41]. The epithelial cells comprising this structure appear to have an increased sensitivity to extracellular LPS in modeled microgravity conditions, although the mechanism is not fully understood [45]. The acceleration of the LPS-induced apoptosis event may be tied to the global regulator Hfq, which similar to S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa is down regulated in V. fischeri during modeled microgravity conditions [45]. Additionally, mutants defective in the hfq gene exhibited attenuated levels of apoptotic cell death in microgravity although the timing was still accelerated compared to gravity controls [45]. Experiments are currently underway to examine changes in microgravity-induced gene expression of wild-type V. fischeri and mutants defective in the hfq gene to assess the impact of modeled microgravity on the symbiont transcriptome (J. Foster unpublished).4. Impact of Microgravity on Plant-Microbe Associations As humans move beyond Earth’s biosphere and undergo the long-term habitation of space, life support systems will inevitably require plants. Understanding the physical and genetic impact of microgravity on plant physiology and their associated microbes will be critical [16,18]. Much like the animal microbiome, plants are also colonized by trillions of microbial cells that form complex and metabolically diverse ecosystems influencing their health and growth [81,82]. In terrestrial systems, these beneficial microbes are typically associated with the rhizosphere, a narrow zone surrounding the plant roots. Plants can exude up to 21% of their photosynthetically fixed carbon into the root–soil interface [83], which can influence the microbial activity and diversity, thereby enhancing seed germination rates, nutrient uptake, plant growth and development [82,84]. Recent studies have shown that plants actively recruit disease-suppressive microbes that can protect the host from various infections through the production specific molecules, such as nonribosomal peptide synthases [85,86], and boost the plant immune system [87]. For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana, the rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescence can induce the induced systemic resistance (ISR) response of the host by the apoplastic secretion of low molecular weight molecules that locally suppress flagellin-triggered immune responses [88]. Activation of ISR can accelerate defense-associated gene expression in the host, thus priming the plant immune system and facilitating resistance to a wide range of pathogens [89]. In spaceflight, however, the structural complexity and species richness of the plant rhizosphere can be reduced due to the limitations on using friable soils in microgravity and the lack of natural water drainage, which can result in poor aeration in the root zone [90,91]. Plants cultivated in space flight conditions have been grown in various media, including agar plates, growth pouches, absorbent “floral foams”, and in sub-irrigated porous arcillite (calcined clay chips) [92,93]. These studies have often used specialized growth chambers (e.g., Astroculture, the Biomass Production System, Lada, and others), which typically control light, humidity, carbon dioxide and regulated temperature [18,90,92,94,95,96,97,98]. Some of these chambers, such as the Russian Svet (on Mir) and the Lada on the International Space Station (ISS) are open to the cabin air [97] and hence exposed to the organic volatiles and very high CO2 levels of the cabin air, which can affect the plants in ways unrelated to microgravity [99,100]. It is not unreasonable to assume that these other space environment effects could then also influence host-microbe interactions. Several investigations have revealed that plants grown in microgravity exhibit an increased susceptibility to plant pathogens [15,96,101,102]. For example, soybeans cultivated under space flight conditions in the presence of the pathogenic fungus Phytophthora sojae showed high levels of disease symptoms (i.e., browning and maceration of the roots) compared to ground controls. Additionally, increased levels of fungal structures penetrating the vascular tissue of the plant were also observed suggesting that under microgravity conditions the pathogen more effectively colonized the host tissues [96]. Microgravity exposure has also been shown to negatively impact plant cell wall integrity, as both cell wall regeneration and lignin biosynthesis can be repressed under spaceflight conditions thereby facilitating colonization of fungal pathogens [18,102]. This increase in pathogenesis during spaceflight may reflect the disruption to the normal healthy rhizosphere microbiome. Although the effects of microgravity appear to increase susceptibility of the plant host to disease, less is known of its impact on associations with beneficial microbes. One of the few known examples includes the symbioses between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and leguminous plants. Nitrogen fixation is a critical bacterial metabolism for future life support systems to help cycle inert dinitrogen to the more usable ammonia [103], however, the effects of microgravity on the major stages of root nodule formation and colonization are not well known. Early studies have shown that under modeled microgravity conditions, Rhizobium leguminosarum cells can increase binding of succinate, a key molecule in the differentiation of the bacteria to bacteroids, a distinct cell-type capable of fixing nitrogen [103,104]. This increased binding, however, did not alter the developmental time line of the bacteroid formation and there were no statistical differences between microgravity and gravity controls [103]. Similar experiments have been since replicated during spaceflight for longer durations using the partners Medicago truncatula, the barrel clover, and the bacterial symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti (G. Stutte and M. Roberts unpublished). No developmental delays were observed between spaceflight and 1 × g gravity controls conditions. The S. meliloti cells were able to effectively colonize and induce normal nodule formation in the plant host suggesting this symbiosis may play an important role in future life support systems (G. Stutte and M. Roberts unpublished). Although additional work is required to characterize the impact of spaceflight on these rhizobia-legume symbioses and other members of the plant microbiome, especially at the genome-level, these initial results suggest that microgravity does not impair the initial colonization and cell–cell communication required by the host and microbial association. As the plant microbiome can, in turn, directly influence the human microbiome through the ingestion of raw plants or through environmental interactions in a closed life support system, it will become critical to expand our understanding of the effects of microgravity on these key plant–microbe interactions.5. Summary The recent advance in our understanding of human and plant biology with respect to their microbiomes represents a new frontier for space biology research [105]. It is increasingly clear that astronauts, and other eukaryotic hosts, should be considered as metaorganisms, whose crosstalk and interactions with their microbes at the genetic and cellular level have redefined our definition of health and disease [106]. As manned exploration of space continues beyond the biosphere, it will be critical to examine the stability and resiliency of the human and plant metaorganism to spaceflight-induced stresses, including microgravity. For example, if keystone microbes are lost in the host community, this may result in a shift in species diversity and richness of the microbiome, thus potentially facilitating the rise of opportunistic pathogens that might otherwise be contained by the normal microbial community. To the microbe, eukaryotes simply represent a complex environment in which it must perpetually navigate and adapt to maintain its fitness [22]. This adaptation can occur through horizontal gene transfer events, and recent sequencing evidence suggests that in humans, the microbiome is a hotspot for genetic transfer, facilitating the exchange of antibiotic resistance, food digestion and nutrient metabolism genes that may provide the microbe a competitive advantage within the host community [3,107]. Understanding the nature and frequency of such events, as well as the overall stability of the microbiome under microgravity conditions, will not only help elucidate how microgravity alters this dynamic microbial landscape but will help enable the formation of new strategies for maintenance and potential restoration of the healthy microbiome during spaceflight.Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Jennifer Mobberley for her useful comments on this manuscript.

    "abstract": "Summary Recent research has shown that the microbiota affects the biology of associated host epithelial tissues, including their circadian rhythms, although few data are available on how such influences shape the microarchitecture of the brush border. The squid-vibrio system exhibits two modifications of the brush border that supports the symbionts: effacement and repolarization. Together these occur on a daily rhythm in adult animals, at the dawn expulsion of symbionts into the environment, and symbiont colonization of the juvenile host induces an increase in microvillar density. Here we sought to define how these processes are related and the roles of both symbiont colonization and environmental cues. Ultrastructural analyses showed that the juvenile-organ brush borders also efface concomitantly with daily dawn-cued expulsion of symbionts. Manipulation of the environmental light cue and juvenile symbiotic state demonstrated that this behaviour requires the light cue, but not colonization. In contrast, symbionts were required for the observed increase in microvillar density that accompanies post dawn brush-border repolarization; this increase was induced solely by host exposure to phosphorylated lipid A of symbiont cells. These data demonstrate that a partnering of environmental and symbiont cues shapes the brush border and that microbe-associated molecular patterns play a role in the regulation of brush-border microarchitecture.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Perhaps, the most common type of animal symbiosis, whether pathogenic, commensal or mutualistic, is the interaction of microbial cells along the apical surfaces of polarized host epithelia (for reviews, see Fraune and Bosch, 2010; Hooper, 2015). At these interfaces, the partners influence one another’s form and function. For example, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) efface the brush border and hijack the cytoskeletal proteins of the epithelia to create features that promote pathogenesis (Celli et al., 2000). The microbiota of both invertebrates and vertebrates can induce an increase in the density of microvilli (Cerezuela et al., 2012; Chichlowski et al., 2007; Kuhlwein et al., 2013; Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998; Ringø et al., 2007; Shukla et al., 2012) and, reciprocally, microvillus-derived vesicles of the brush border help to communicate with and control bacterial populations (Shifrin et al., 2012). In addition, it has long been known that epithelial tissues associated with microbes, such as the gut, are on profound daily rhythms. Only recently, however, has it been demonstrated that the microbial partners play a role in the control of these rhythms (Heath-Heckman et al., 2013; Leone et al., 2015; Rosselot et al., 2016; Wier et al., 2010), but the extent to which daily rhythms affect the microarchitecture of the brush border has not been characterized. The Euprymna scolopes-Vibrio fischeri symbiosis offers an opportunity to explore how and when symbiont-induced changes of the brush border are induced in early development and how they interface with the daily rhythms of the symbiosis. Early studies of the association demonstrated that colonization of the host animal induces ultrastructural changes in the epithelial cells of crypts where symbionts take up residence. The epithelium of the newly hatched juvenile host begins as a simple, columnar epithelial layer with sparse microvilli (Fig. S1A). Upon symbiont colonization, these epithelial cells increase in volume fourfold to take on a cuboidal morphology (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1994; Visick et al., 2000). In addition, the density and complexity of microvilli increases such that symbiont cells, while remaining extracellular, become surrounded by host membranes (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998; Fig. S1A). These observed changes were derived from data taken at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h following colonization, i.e., at times that would not capture daily rhythms. Concomitant with these studies of the juvenile, it was discovered that the symbiosis in adults has a daily rhythm; animals expel ~95% of their symbionts into the surrounding seawater each day around dawn (Graf and Ruby, 1998; Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 1998). A recent study of the adult transcriptome over the day–night cycle demonstrated that host cytoskeletal genes are highly regulated in the hours around dawn (Wier et al., 2010). These changes in gene expression correlate with a blebbing off of the microvilli of the crypt epithelial brush border, not unlike that observed in EPEC pathogenesis; this effacement is followed by a re-formation of the microvillous brush border (Fig. S1B). A subsequent study of the system revealed that the symbionts control transcriptional regulation of clock genes of a peripheral circadian rhythm specific to the light organ (Heath-Heckman et al., 2013). Taken together, these data showed that the squid-vibrio symbiosis displays a profound daily rhythm. Whether the daily changes in the adult brush border occur in juveniles, and how such changes interface with symbiont-induced development of the juvenile crypt epithelia, have not been characterized. In addition, while it is known that increase in crypt cell volume requires symbiont light production (Visick et al., 2000), the feature(s) of the symbiont that trigger(s) brush-border remodelling has remained unknown. This study was undertaken to address these questions. The data show that the remodelling of the crypt brush borders begins in juvenile animals and this activity requires influences from both an environmental light cue and interaction with the microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) of symbiont cells.",

    "results": "Results Characterizing the timing of venting behaviour Previous studies showed that the phenomenon of daily venting of symbionts by adult E. scolopes depends on an exogenous ‘dawn’ light cue, i.e., onset of light in animals entrained to a 12:12 light/dark (L/D) cycle (Graf and Ruby, 1998; Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 1998). However, the timing of venting relative to exposure of the animal to light had not been resolved, data that are critical to further analyses of brush-border dynamics. Thus, we designed experiments to observe and manipulate venting in the juvenile squid, which also display venting behaviour, but are more experimentally manipulable. In these assays, individual animals were maintained in vials, but removed from these vials at time points before and after a light cue to measure the presence or absence of V. fischeri luminescence in the water. As in adult animals, symbiont venting in juveniles maintained on a 12:12 L/D cycle occurred following the light cue of dawn (Fig. 1). As the symbionts were vented, luminescence increased and peaked by ~2 h after the cue. This peak was followed by a decline in the amount of luminescence to undetectable levels by ~6 h post onset of environmental light, because of the loss of luminescence activity that results from absence of nutrients to the expelled symbionts (Lee and Ruby, 1994). However, animals entrained on a 12:12 L/D cycle and then exposed to a delayed dawn of up to 10 h did not show venting until after the delayed light cue was presented, i.e., dependence on a light cue persisted for several hours after the entrained dawn; however, after 10 h without a light cue, the animals begin to vent spontaneously (Fig. S2). These data demonstrated that the venting behaviour is not on an entrained circadian rhythm and that the timing of the cue can be experimentally manipulated independent of circadian behaviours for up to 10 h. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Natural venting behaviour. Animals were entrained on a 12:12 light/dark regime, and luminescence of vented Vibrio fischeri was measured in the surrounding water before and after the dawn light cue. Data shown are from one representative experiment. First and peak luminescence occur between ~0.5 and 2.5 h following the cue. RLU, relative light units. Timing of effacement of crypt-cell microvilli and the effect of light-cue manipulation We first examined whether effacement of the crypt epithelial brush border occurs in the juvenile as it does in the adult (Wier et al., 2010) and, if so, whether the process is associated with venting, i.e., affected by the time and influenced by symbiotic state of the animal. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we quantified microvilli along epithelial apical surfaces (Fig. 2A – C). All experiments were performed with animals at 24 h post inoculation or longer, when the light organ is fully colonized and daily rhythms are reliably occurring. Effacement was detected as soon as 5 min after the dawn cue at 36 h post-hatching. Microvillar density at this time was 55–65% of that observed at 24 h post-hatching, or at ‘dusk’ of the first day (Fig. 2D); maximal microvillar density also occurs around dusk in light organs of adult animals (Wier et al., 2010). By 38 h post-hatching, or ~2 h after the light cue, the microvillar density had decreased to 25–35% of that at dusk (Fig. 2D). Both symbiotic (Sym) and aposymbiotic (Apo) animals showed a similar, significant decrease in microvillar density in response to the dawn cue (34–36 h P < 0.001 for Sym and Apo), indicating that the effacement was not dependent upon colonization state. In addition, the effacement was localized to the microvilli and did not extend into the crypt epithelial cells (Fig. 2E), as was seen previously in adult squid (Wier et al., 2010). These data demonstrate that effacement occurs in juvenile animals and is independent of symbiotic state. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Daily effacement of the crypt epithelial brush border. A.

D.

Error bars, standard error of the mean. E. Representative transmission electron microscopy images of fields measured for the 34 (2 h before light cue) and 38 h (2 h after light cue) conditions in (D).Because effacement began soon after the dawn light cue, we then sought to determine whether a dawn cue serves as a stimulus for the effacement of crypt-cell microvilli. We presented juvenile animals with a light cue 6 h before their anticipated dawn, at normal dawn, or 6 h after their normal dawn, and then measured the microvillar density 2 h before, 5 min after and 2 h after these light cues for all three conditions. The crypt-cell microvilli significantly decreased in number beginning 5 min after the light cue independent of whether the cue was given early, at normal dawn, or after normal dawn (Fig. 3). However, the decrease occurred slightly more slowly in animals presented an early light cue as shown by a significant decrease in microvillar density between 0 and 2 h after the light cue in the animals given an early light cue (P < 0.05), but not in those given light cues at normal dawn or after normal dawn (Fig. 3; 6 h early/late), suggesting that the nadir in microvillar density was reached more quickly in those animals presented with a normal or late light cue. These data provide evidence that effacement is triggered by an exogenous light cue. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab The effect of light-cue manipulation on crypt-cell microvillar density of symbiotic juvenile animals. Light cues were given to cohorts of animals 6 h before normal dawn (left), at normal dawn (middle), or 6 h after normal dawn (right). Within each cohort, microvillar density was measured 2 h before (−2), at (0), or 2 h after (2) the light cue. For each set, the data were normalized to the −2 h condition, although all statistics were performed on the raw data, which were then transformed. n = three biological replicates and seven technical replicates per condition; Error bars, standard error of the mean; * = P < 0.05, ** = P < 0.01, *** = P < 0.001 by an analysis of variance with a Tukey’s pairwise comparison. Symbiosis-dependent regrowth of crypt microvilli and its uncoupling from epithelial cell swelling While effacement of the crypt-cell microvilli was not symbiosis dependent, previous data showed that microvillar density of the crypt epithelia increases each day following the onset of symbiosis (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998). To investigate this change with symbiosis, we compared density of microvilli in aposymbiotic and symbiotic animals at 38, 40 and 42 h, i.e., 2, 4 and 6 h following venting at 36 h post colonization. Regrowth of the microvilli following effacement occurred ~3× faster in symbiotic animals than in aposymbiotic animals (average =86 mv/25 µm2 h−1 ± 10 vs 31 mv/25 µm2 h−1 ± 4.6 respectively) with symbiotic animals reaching a microvillar density more than twice that of their aposymbiotic counterparts (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab The influence of symbiosis on microvillar regrowth. A. Quantification of microvillar density in aposymbiotic (Apo) and wild-type (WT) colonized juvenile squid at 38, 40 and 42 h after hatching. B.

Error bars, standard error of the mean; n = three biological replicates and seven technical replicates per condition.To determine whether colonization level or symbiont luminescence is critical for the symbiosis-induced change in microvillar density, we compared density along the brush borders of animals colonized with wild-type V. fischeri to those colonized by the non-luminescent strain (Δlux) and the lysine auxotroph (lysA), both of which exhibit a symbiont colonization level approximately 10% of wild-type V. fischeri at 24–48 h post inoculation (Bose et al., 2008; Whistler et al., 2007). Microvillar densities induced by these mutant strains were statistically indistinguishable from each other and from wild type; all strains were 50–75% higher than that of aposymbiotic animals (Fig. 4B; upper, P < 0.001). These data suggest that the induction of symbiont-mediated microvillar growth is not dependent upon bacterial density or bacterial light. Symbionts also induce a fourfold increase in volume of host crypt epithelial cells, which is light dependent, but not dependent on colonization level (Visick et al., 2000). Both the Δlux-colonized and the aposymbiotic animals showed this significantly smaller cell width as compared with wild type and lysA-colonized animals (Fig. 4B; lower P < 0.001), demonstrating that the symbiosis-mediated increase in microvillar density was not coupled to the cell swelling phenotype. The effect of bacterial products on microvillar regrowth Because symbiont MAMPs, particularly the peptidoglycan monomer (also known as ‘tracheal cytotoxin’ or TCT) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induce several host developmental phenotypes in the squid-vibrio symbiosis (for review, see McFall-Ngai et al., 2010), we compared the change in microvillar density in animals exposed to wild-type symbionts with those exposed to V. fischeri MAMPs. Either LPS alone or LPS and TCT combined induced microvillar densities that were statistically indistinguishable from symbiotic animals. However, TCT-treated animals exhibited a microvillar density of about 75% relative to animals colonized by wild-type V. fischeri (P < 0.05). Thus, while TCT has some effect, the data demonstrate that LPS alone can induce the increases in microvillar density observed in the juvenile squid (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5.

Juvenile animals colonized with wild-type (WT) V. fischeri, left uncolonized (Apo), or exposed to V. fischeri lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or peptidoglycan monomer (TCT).

Colonization by either WT or the waaL mutant resulted in microvillar densities significantly greater than that of aposymbiotic animals (middle, P < 0.001). Brush borders of animals colonized with WT V. fischeri or exposed to LPS treated with heat-inactivated alkaline phosphatase (LPS + hi-AP) showed no significant difference in microvillar density (right); these groups showed significantly greater microvillar density than animals exposed to LPS treated with active AP (LPS + AP) or those left uncolonized (Apo) (P < 0.001). a, b, c – denotes groups with statistically similar means using a significance level of P < 0.05 by an analysis of variance followed by a Tukey’s pairwise comparison performed on the raw data. Error bars, standard error of the mean; n = three biological replicates and seven technical replicates per condition.To define the physical relationship of the crypt epithelial cells to symbiont LPS, we performed electron-microscopy immunocytochemistry using a polyclonal antibody generated to V. fischeri LPS. Cross-reactivity of the antibody to LPS localized to the outer envelope of colonized V. fischeri cells, the host crypt lumen, and inside of the host epithelial cells (Fig. 5B), providing several possible locations for interactions of host receptors with the LPS ligand. Different portions of the V. fischeri LPS molecule, including the phosphate groups, acyl chains and the O-antigen, have been implicated in the various developmental phenotypes of the host squid (Altura et al., 2011; Post et al., 2012; Rader et al., 2012) (Fig. 5C). Thus, we conducted experiments aimed at defining the active portion of the LPS molecule that induces an increase in microvillar density along the crypt brush border of juvenile animals. To determine whether the O-antigen moiety of LPS is active in this process, we colonized juvenile squid with a mutant lacking the O-antigen (waaL) and compared the microvillar density in those animals at 48 h with that in animals colonized with wild-type (WT) V. fischeri and animals left uncolonized (Apo) (Fig. 5C). Microvillar density did not differ significantly between the WT and waaL-colonized animals (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the O-antigen does not play a role in the induction of the process. To determine whether phosphorylation of the lipid A is necessary for the induction of microvillar growth in the light organ, we treated the LPS with alkaline phosphatase (AP) or with heat-inactivated AP as a control (Fig. 5C). We then exposed juvenile animals to both LPS preparations and compared the microvillar densities of treated animals with those of animals colonized with WT V. fischeri and those left aposymbiotic. Microvillar density was significantly lower in aposymbiotic animals and those exposed to AP-treated LPS relative to animals colonized with the WT strain and those exposed to LPS treated with heat-inactivated AP. However, the microvillar density of animals exposed to AP-treated LPS was slightly but significantly higher than that of aposymbiotic animals (P<0.05), suggesting that either not all of the phosphate groups were cleaved from the LPS molecule during AP treatment or that another portion of the V. fischeri LPS molecule works together with the phosphorylated lipid A to affect host crypt-cell microvillar density.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The results of this study on the squid-vibrio symbiosis, which exploited the capability to manipulate juvenile animals experimentally, provide evidence that (i) effacement of the brush border occurs daily around dawn in juveniles and persists throughout the life time of the host; (ii) the trigger for this effacement is the light cue of dawn and is independent of symbiosis; (iii) the monotonic increase in microvillar density at dawn in juveniles requires V. fischeri colonization, but is not dependent on level of colonization or luminescence capacity of the symbionts; and (iv) this increase in density is induced by phosphorylated lipid A. These data, when integrated with past contributions, provide a new model for the diurnal and developmental dynamics of the crypt brush border in the squid-vibrio symbiosis. Microvillar shedding as a response to environmental light cues Whereas in pathogenic associations, such as EPEC, colonization induces a single, terminal effacement of the microvilli, effacement is independent of the symbionts in the squid-vibrio symbiosis. Instead, evidence presented here suggests that the brush border effacement of the squid light organ, which is embryonically gut derived (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1993), requires a light cue. Circadian rhythms, which are principally entrained by light cues, control numerous cellular processes of the mammalian gut (Froy, 2011), although, to our knowledge, the influences of rhythms on brush-border ultrastructure and cues that might mediate any such changes have not been reported. However, the light-cued central clock of the brain entrains the peripheral clock that, in turn, regulates epithelial function of the intestine (Pacha and Sumova, 2013). As such, analysis of the mammalian intestinal epithelium for changes in the brush-border microarchitecture in response to environmental light cues, independent of the microbiota, may be a fruitful research avenue. The daily effacement of the brush border may not be a ‘hard-wired’ feature associated with evolutionary selection on symbiosis in the squid-vibrio system, but instead may be related to convergence of the light organ with the eye. Several studies have focused on the structural and functional similarities of these organs. Although the eye is photoreceptive and the light organ is photogenic, they have similar accessory tissues to modify light (Crookes et al., 2004; Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1992), as well as similar biochemistry and developmental induction (Peyer et al., 2014; Tong et al., 2009). Relevant here is that the shedding of microvilli in response to light is common in the rhabdomeric photoreceptors that are characteristic of certain invertebrate eyes, including those of cephalopods (Battelle, 2013; Gray et al., 2008; Stark et al., 1988). The renewal of portions of photoreceptors is common in both invertebrate and vertebrate eyes as a response to the photo-oxidative reactions that can ultimately lead to retinal degeneration (Jinks et al., 1998; Strauss, 2005). The behaviour shedding of the microvilli in rhabdomeric eyes thus serves to renew the microvilli of the retinal cells each day. As with other characters of the light organ that appear to be co-opted from the eye, effacement behaviour may serve a similar function, i.e., to renew the host’s cellular interface with the bacterial partner on a daily basis in response to oxidative stress imposed by the symbiosis (Ruby and McFall-Ngai, 1999). Although the effacement behaviour of the crypt brush border of juveniles does not require the interaction with symbionts, we cannot rule out a role for triggering this behaviour in the light organ of mature animals. Recent studies of the system have demonstrated that the organ undergoes maturation over the first few weeks of the symbiosis, which results in a dramatic change in its biochemistry. Notably, at ~4 weeks, a rhythm of symbiont metabolism ensues that correlates with a daily acidification and a change in the oxygen availability in the crypts (Schwartzman et al., 2015). Whereas the relative anatomical and biochemical simplicity of the juvenile organ revealed the lack of a role of the symbiont in effacement, the complexity of the adult organ renders such a determination challenging, if not impossible. Symbiont-induced hypertrophy of epithelial brush borders The form and function of the terminal web of polarized epithelia is a principal target of bacterial symbionts, a phenomenon that has been best studied in pathogens. In many cases, bacterial alterations of the brush border result in a more intimate association of the bacterial cells with host cell membranes, similar to what has been observed in early colonization of the squid-host crypts by V. fischeri (Fig. S1). For example, the attaching and effacing activity of EPEC and enterohemorrhagic E. coli is followed by a complex set of events in which the pathogen hijacks the host cytoskeleton to produce ‘pedestals’ at the site of attachment that cradle the pathogen (DeVinney et al., 2001; Gruber and Sperandio, 2014; Gruenheid et al., 2001) and promote pathogenesis (Aroeti et al., 2012). More subtle effects occur with the early colonization of nasopharyngeal epithelia by Neisseria meningitidis; following attachment to the epithelium, this opportunistic pathogen recruits host cytoskeletal proteins to induce elongation of the brush-border microvilli (Higashi et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 1983). Although these phenomena have been studied for decades in pathogens, new data demonstrate that normal colonization by the microbiota can also affect the brush border; manipulation of the microbiota diversity and abundance by antibiotics and probiotics can influence the density of intestinal-cell epithelia (Cerezuela et al., 2012; Chichlowski et al., 2007; Kuhlwein et al., 2013; Ringø et al., 2007; Shukla et al., 2012). Both biochemical and biophysical features of bacteria have been implicated in induction of brush-border remodelling. Several bacterial pathogens, such as EPEC, use type III secretion systems to introduce effector molecules directly into host-cell cytoplasm (Coburn et al., 2007). In a study of N. meningitidis pathogenesis, the biophysical force exerted by type IV pili was implicated in driving the elongation of the microvilli (Higashi et al., 2009), but the precise mechanism of this action was not determined. A recent study of EPEC, which also requires type IV pili for virulence, has shown that the influence of the biophysical forces exerted by the pili is likely indirect (Aroeti et al., 2012). The data provide evidence that the pili serve simply to draw the pathogen closer to the host cell membranes, which promotes the opportunity for full virulence of the type III secretion system. Such phenomena may occur in the squid-vibrio system, wherein presentation of lipid A requires interaction of host cells with symbiont pili; V. fischeri encodes eight type IV pili (Ruby et al., 2005) that may function individually or in combination to facilitate signalling and colonization (Stabb and Ruby, 2003). Although MAMPs, including LPS (e.g., Isowa et al., 1999; Gutiérrez-Venegas et al., 2008; Kleveta et al., 2012), have been shown to perturb the cytoskeletal network of host cells, they have not been implicated directly in remodelling of the brush border. The observation that phosphorylated lipid A is required for the developmental increase in brush-border microvillar density adds to a long list of MAMP-induced developmental phenotypes in the host squid (McFall-Ngai et al., 2010). Lipid A works in synergy with the peptidoglycan monomer to induce apoptosis and morphogenesis of the superficial ciliated epithelium that potentiates colonization (Koropatnick et al., 2004). We have determined that symbiont MAMPs are inducers of many host-squid developmental phenotypes, but much work remains to be carried out to elucidate how the MAMPs are delivered to and recognized by host cells. A recent study of the system demonstrated that outer membrane vesicles contain MAMPs and that host cells take up these vesicles (Aschtgen et al., 2015). The molecular basis of how these outer membrane vesicles signal to the host may be through the light-organ pattern-recognition receptors. The light organ expresses numerous pattern-recognition receptors (McFall-Ngai et al., 2010). One of these, a LPS binding protein, EsLBP1, binds V. fischeri LPS, and the gene that encodes for this protein is upregulated about 20-fold in the crypt spaces in response to peptidoglycan derivatives, and not LPS, of the colonizing symbiont (Krasity et al., 2015). The role that this LPS ligand plays in the induction of LPS-mediated changes in the host brush border remains to be determined. We have not defined here how lipid A mediates these changes in the crypt brush border, but we have established a link to the daily rhythms of these tissues. These data complement another recent study of the system, which demonstrated a daily regulation of host AP activity (Rader et al., 2012). Several contributions report that the activity of secreted host AP dephosphorylates, and thus ‘detoxifies’, lipid A in symbiotic systems, including the squid-vibrio association and the intestinal-microbiota symbioses of the vertebrate gut (Bates et al., 2007). AP activity fluctuates over the day–night cycle in both juveniles and adults, being highest mid-day, and low around the time of effacement (Fig. 6A). These data would suggest that phosphorylated lipid A delivers the signal for microvilli regrowth around dawn. Studies of the host transcriptome over the day–night cycle demonstrate that genes encoding host cytoskeletal proteins are upregulated in the hours before dawn (Wier et al., 2010), suggesting that the tissues are biochemically primed for the lipid A signal of the symbiont. Finally, in recent studies of both pathogens and members of the microbiota, the dephosphylation of their lipid A renders them more resistant to the activity of antimicrobial peptides (Cullen et al., 2015; Herrera et al., 2014), a consequence that may also occur in the squid-vibrio symbiosis. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Model for crypt brush border dynamics in early development through maturation of the light organ. A. Early development. Unlike the monotonic increase first suggested by an earlier study (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998), analysis of the system over the day–night cycle predicts effacement and regrowth each day over the first several days in both aposymbiotic (Apo, red lines) and symbiotic (Sym, blue lines) animals. In the symbiotic animals, the regrowth includes an increase in microvillar density. Incorporating data from a study of AP activity show that it remains low in aposymbiotic (Apo, red bars) animals and is low in symbiotic animals around dawn, but is high in symbiotic animals (Sym, blue bars) mid-day. B. The established daily rhythm of the host brush border, with most of the remodelling events occurring in the hours surrounding dawn. A new model of brush border dynamics The data provided here, along with those of earlier studies (notably, Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998; Wier et al., 2010, and Rader et al., 2012), allow us to construct a detailed model of the brush border in early development and over the day–night cycle through the life of the host (Fig. 6). The early symbiosis is a time of rapid changes in the light organ with an underlying daily rhythm (Fig. 6A) of effacement and augmented regrowth, with associated fluctuations in AP activity, which mediate a cycle of phosphorylation on the LPS molecule. The complexity of the brush-border ultrastructure of adult crypt epithelia does not suggest that the microvilli continue to increase in their density over the several months of the squid’s life at the rate observed in the first days of the symbiosis. Instead, it appears that the mature association settles down into a rhythm of effacement and regrowth, with much of the critical underlying biochemistry occurring in the hours before and after dawn (Fig. 6B). Future investigations will focus both upon the signalling pathways activated by symbiont lipid A and on the participation of circadian rhythms in the shaping of the brush border. In addition, investigation of other features of the symbiont, such as pili, that may be required for the effective presentation of MAMPs, will be explored. Both bacteria-induced development and bacteria-entrained daily rhythms mediated by clock genes were first described in the squid-vibrio symbiosis and later found in vertebrates (Bouskra et al., 2008; Leone et al., 2015). As such, studies of whether the processes described in this contribution also occur in vertebrates may reveal important features of animal-bacterial interactions that are conserved over evolutionary time.",

Copyright notice ID: 5219934 MSID: MS838977 PMID: 27062511 The publisher's version of this article is available at Cell Microbiol Summary Recent research has shown that the microbiota affects the biology of associated host epithelial tissues, including their circadian rhythms, although few data are available on how such influences shape the microarchitecture of the brush border. The squid-vibrio system exhibits two modifications of the brush border that supports the symbionts: effacement and repolarization. Together these occur on a daily rhythm in adult animals, at the dawn expulsion of symbionts into the environment, and symbiont colonization of the juvenile host induces an increase in microvillar density. Here we sought to define how these processes are related and the roles of both symbiont colonization and environmental cues. Ultrastructural analyses showed that the juvenile-organ brush borders also efface concomitantly with daily dawn-cued expulsion of symbionts. Manipulation of the environmental light cue and juvenile symbiotic state demonstrated that this behaviour requires the light cue, but not colonization. In contrast, symbionts were required for the observed increase in microvillar density that accompanies post dawn brush-border repolarization; this increase was induced solely by host exposure to phosphorylated lipid A of symbiont cells. These data demonstrate that a partnering of environmental and symbiont cues shapes the brush border and that microbe-associated molecular patterns play a role in the regulation of brush-border microarchitecture.Introduction Perhaps, the most common type of animal symbiosis, whether pathogenic, commensal or mutualistic, is the interaction of microbial cells along the apical surfaces of polarized host epithelia (for reviews, see Fraune and Bosch, 2010; Hooper, 2015). At these interfaces, the partners influence one another’s form and function. For example, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) efface the brush border and hijack the cytoskeletal proteins of the epithelia to create features that promote pathogenesis (Celli et al., 2000). The microbiota of both invertebrates and vertebrates can induce an increase in the density of microvilli (Cerezuela et al., 2012; Chichlowski et al., 2007; Kuhlwein et al., 2013; Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998; Ringø et al., 2007; Shukla et al., 2012) and, reciprocally, microvillus-derived vesicles of the brush border help to communicate with and control bacterial populations (Shifrin et al., 2012). In addition, it has long been known that epithelial tissues associated with microbes, such as the gut, are on profound daily rhythms. Only recently, however, has it been demonstrated that the microbial partners play a role in the control of these rhythms (Heath-Heckman et al., 2013; Leone et al., 2015; Rosselot et al., 2016; Wier et al., 2010), but the extent to which daily rhythms affect the microarchitecture of the brush border has not been characterized. The Euprymna scolopes-Vibrio fischeri symbiosis offers an opportunity to explore how and when symbiont-induced changes of the brush border are induced in early development and how they interface with the daily rhythms of the symbiosis. Early studies of the association demonstrated that colonization of the host animal induces ultrastructural changes in the epithelial cells of crypts where symbionts take up residence. The epithelium of the newly hatched juvenile host begins as a simple, columnar epithelial layer with sparse microvilli (Fig. S1A). Upon symbiont colonization, these epithelial cells increase in volume fourfold to take on a cuboidal morphology (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1994; Visick et al., 2000). In addition, the density and complexity of microvilli increases such that symbiont cells, while remaining extracellular, become surrounded by host membranes (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998; Fig. S1A). These observed changes were derived from data taken at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h following colonization, i.e., at times that would not capture daily rhythms. Concomitant with these studies of the juvenile, it was discovered that the symbiosis in adults has a daily rhythm; animals expel ~95% of their symbionts into the surrounding seawater each day around dawn (Graf and Ruby, 1998; Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 1998). A recent study of the adult transcriptome over the day–night cycle demonstrated that host cytoskeletal genes are highly regulated in the hours around dawn (Wier et al., 2010). These changes in gene expression correlate with a blebbing off of the microvilli of the crypt epithelial brush border, not unlike that observed in EPEC pathogenesis; this effacement is followed by a re-formation of the microvillous brush border (Fig. S1B). A subsequent study of the system revealed that the symbionts control transcriptional regulation of clock genes of a peripheral circadian rhythm specific to the light organ (Heath-Heckman et al., 2013). Taken together, these data showed that the squid-vibrio symbiosis displays a profound daily rhythm. Whether the daily changes in the adult brush border occur in juveniles, and how such changes interface with symbiont-induced development of the juvenile crypt epithelia, have not been characterized. In addition, while it is known that increase in crypt cell volume requires symbiont light production (Visick et al., 2000), the feature(s) of the symbiont that trigger(s) brush-border remodelling has remained unknown. This study was undertaken to address these questions. The data show that the remodelling of the crypt brush borders begins in juvenile animals and this activity requires influences from both an environmental light cue and interaction with the microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) of symbiont cells.Results Characterizing the timing of venting behaviour Previous studies showed that the phenomenon of daily venting of symbionts by adult E. scolopes depends on an exogenous ‘dawn’ light cue, i.e., onset of light in animals entrained to a 12:12 light/dark (L/D) cycle (Graf and Ruby, 1998; Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 1998). However, the timing of venting relative to exposure of the animal to light had not been resolved, data that are critical to further analyses of brush-border dynamics. Thus, we designed experiments to observe and manipulate venting in the juvenile squid, which also display venting behaviour, but are more experimentally manipulable. In these assays, individual animals were maintained in vials, but removed from these vials at time points before and after a light cue to measure the presence or absence of V. fischeri luminescence in the water. As in adult animals, symbiont venting in juveniles maintained on a 12:12 L/D cycle occurred following the light cue of dawn (Fig. 1). As the symbionts were vented, luminescence increased and peaked by ~2 h after the cue. This peak was followed by a decline in the amount of luminescence to undetectable levels by ~6 h post onset of environmental light, because of the loss of luminescence activity that results from absence of nutrients to the expelled symbionts (Lee and Ruby, 1994). However, animals entrained on a 12:12 L/D cycle and then exposed to a delayed dawn of up to 10 h did not show venting until after the delayed light cue was presented, i.e., dependence on a light cue persisted for several hours after the entrained dawn; however, after 10 h without a light cue, the animals begin to vent spontaneously (Fig. S2). These data demonstrated that the venting behaviour is not on an entrained circadian rhythm and that the timing of the cue can be experimentally manipulated independent of circadian behaviours for up to 10 h. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Natural venting behaviour. Animals were entrained on a 12:12 light/dark regime, and luminescence of vented Vibrio fischeri was measured in the surrounding water before and after the dawn light cue. Data shown are from one representative experiment. First and peak luminescence occur between ~0.5 and 2.5 h following the cue. RLU, relative light units.Timing of effacement of crypt-cell microvilli and the effect of light-cue manipulation We first examined whether effacement of the crypt epithelial brush border occurs in the juvenile as it does in the adult (Wier et al., 2010) and, if so, whether the process is associated with venting, i.e., affected by the time and influenced by symbiotic state of the animal. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we quantified microvilli along epithelial apical surfaces (Fig. 2A – C). All experiments were performed with animals at 24 h post inoculation or longer, when the light organ is fully colonized and daily rhythms are reliably occurring. Effacement was detected as soon as 5 min after the dawn cue at 36 h post-hatching. Microvillar density at this time was 55–65% of that observed at 24 h post-hatching, or at ‘dusk’ of the first day (Fig. 2D); maximal microvillar density also occurs around dusk in light organs of adult animals (Wier et al., 2010). By 38 h post-hatching, or ~2 h after the light cue, the microvillar density had decreased to 25–35% of that at dusk (Fig. 2D). Both symbiotic (Sym) and aposymbiotic (Apo) animals showed a similar, significant decrease in microvillar density in response to the dawn cue (34–36 h P < 0.001 for Sym and Apo), indicating that the effacement was not dependent upon colonization state. In addition, the effacement was localized to the microvilli and did not extend into the crypt epithelial cells (Fig. 2E), as was seen previously in adult squid (Wier et al., 2010). These data demonstrate that effacement occurs in juvenile animals and is independent of symbiotic state. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Daily effacement of the crypt epithelial brush border. A.

D.

Microvillar density was normalized to the 24 h time point for both the Apo and Sym conditions. n = three biological replicates (separate animals) and seven technical replicates per condition (different regions within crypt 1). Error bars, standard error of the mean. E. Representative transmission electron microscopy images of fields measured for the 34 (2 h before light cue) and 38 h (2 h after light cue) conditions in (D).Because effacement began soon after the dawn light cue, we then sought to determine whether a dawn cue serves as a stimulus for the effacement of crypt-cell microvilli. We presented juvenile animals with a light cue 6 h before their anticipated dawn, at normal dawn, or 6 h after their normal dawn, and then measured the microvillar density 2 h before, 5 min after and 2 h after these light cues for all three conditions. The crypt-cell microvilli significantly decreased in number beginning 5 min after the light cue independent of whether the cue was given early, at normal dawn, or after normal dawn (Fig. 3). However, the decrease occurred slightly more slowly in animals presented an early light cue as shown by a significant decrease in microvillar density between 0 and 2 h after the light cue in the animals given an early light cue (P < 0.05), but not in those given light cues at normal dawn or after normal dawn (Fig. 3; 6 h early/late), suggesting that the nadir in microvillar density was reached more quickly in those animals presented with a normal or late light cue. These data provide evidence that effacement is triggered by an exogenous light cue. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab The effect of light-cue manipulation on crypt-cell microvillar density of symbiotic juvenile animals. Light cues were given to cohorts of animals 6 h before normal dawn (left), at normal dawn (middle), or 6 h after normal dawn (right). Within each cohort, microvillar density was measured 2 h before (−2), at (0), or 2 h after (2) the light cue. For each set, the data were normalized to the −2 h condition, although all statistics were performed on the raw data, which were then transformed. n = three biological replicates and seven technical replicates per condition; Error bars, standard error of the mean; * = P < 0.05, ** = P < 0.01, *** = P < 0.001 by an analysis of variance with a Tukey’s pairwise comparison.Symbiosis-dependent regrowth of crypt microvilli and its uncoupling from epithelial cell swelling While effacement of the crypt-cell microvilli was not symbiosis dependent, previous data showed that microvillar density of the crypt epithelia increases each day following the onset of symbiosis (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998). To investigate this change with symbiosis, we compared density of microvilli in aposymbiotic and symbiotic animals at 38, 40 and 42 h, i.e., 2, 4 and 6 h following venting at 36 h post colonization. Regrowth of the microvilli following effacement occurred ~3× faster in symbiotic animals than in aposymbiotic animals (average =86 mv/25 µm2 h−1 ± 10 vs 31 mv/25 µm2 h−1 ± 4.6 respectively) with symbiotic animals reaching a microvillar density more than twice that of their aposymbiotic counterparts (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab The influence of symbiosis on microvillar regrowth. A. Quantification of microvillar density in aposymbiotic (Apo) and wild-type (WT) colonized juvenile squid at 38, 40 and 42 h after hatching. B. Microvillar density and cellular width of the crypt epithelium in animals at 48 h post-hatching colonized with WT, a mutant defective in luminescence (Δlux), a lysine auxotroph (lysA) or left uncolonized (Apo). a, b – groups of statistically similar means using a significance level of P < 0.001 by an analysis of variance followed by a Tukey’s pairwise comparison performed on the raw data. Error bars, standard error of the mean; n = three biological replicates and seven technical replicates per condition.To determine whether colonization level or symbiont luminescence is critical for the symbiosis-induced change in microvillar density, we compared density along the brush borders of animals colonized with wild-type V. fischeri to those colonized by the non-luminescent strain (Δlux) and the lysine auxotroph (lysA), both of which exhibit a symbiont colonization level approximately 10% of wild-type V. fischeri at 24–48 h post inoculation (Bose et al., 2008; Whistler et al., 2007). Microvillar densities induced by these mutant strains were statistically indistinguishable from each other and from wild type; all strains were 50–75% higher than that of aposymbiotic animals (Fig. 4B; upper, P < 0.001). These data suggest that the induction of symbiont-mediated microvillar growth is not dependent upon bacterial density or bacterial light. Symbionts also induce a fourfold increase in volume of host crypt epithelial cells, which is light dependent, but not dependent on colonization level (Visick et al., 2000). Both the Δlux-colonized and the aposymbiotic animals showed this significantly smaller cell width as compared with wild type and lysA-colonized animals (Fig. 4B; lower P < 0.001), demonstrating that the symbiosis-mediated increase in microvillar density was not coupled to the cell swelling phenotype.The effect of bacterial products on microvillar regrowth Because symbiont MAMPs, particularly the peptidoglycan monomer (also known as ‘tracheal cytotoxin’ or TCT) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induce several host developmental phenotypes in the squid-vibrio symbiosis (for review, see McFall-Ngai et al., 2010), we compared the change in microvillar density in animals exposed to wild-type symbionts with those exposed to V. fischeri MAMPs. Either LPS alone or LPS and TCT combined induced microvillar densities that were statistically indistinguishable from symbiotic animals. However, TCT-treated animals exhibited a microvillar density of about 75% relative to animals colonized by wild-type V. fischeri (P < 0.05). Thus, while TCT has some effect, the data demonstrate that LPS alone can induce the increases in microvillar density observed in the juvenile squid (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5.

Juvenile animals colonized with wild-type (WT) V. fischeri, left uncolonized (Apo), or exposed to V. fischeri lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or peptidoglycan monomer (TCT).

Colonization by either WT or the waaL mutant resulted in microvillar densities significantly greater than that of aposymbiotic animals (middle, P < 0.001). Brush borders of animals colonized with WT V. fischeri or exposed to LPS treated with heat-inactivated alkaline phosphatase (LPS + hi-AP) showed no significant difference in microvillar density (right); these groups showed significantly greater microvillar density than animals exposed to LPS treated with active AP (LPS + AP) or those left uncolonized (Apo) (P < 0.001). a, b, c – denotes groups with statistically similar means using a significance level of P < 0.05 by an analysis of variance followed by a Tukey’s pairwise comparison performed on the raw data. Error bars, standard error of the mean; n = three biological replicates and seven technical replicates per condition.To define the physical relationship of the crypt epithelial cells to symbiont LPS, we performed electron-microscopy immunocytochemistry using a polyclonal antibody generated to V. fischeri LPS. Cross-reactivity of the antibody to LPS localized to the outer envelope of colonized V. fischeri cells, the host crypt lumen, and inside of the host epithelial cells (Fig. 5B), providing several possible locations for interactions of host receptors with the LPS ligand. Different portions of the V. fischeri LPS molecule, including the phosphate groups, acyl chains and the O-antigen, have been implicated in the various developmental phenotypes of the host squid (Altura et al., 2011; Post et al., 2012; Rader et al., 2012) (Fig. 5C). Thus, we conducted experiments aimed at defining the active portion of the LPS molecule that induces an increase in microvillar density along the crypt brush border of juvenile animals. To determine whether the O-antigen moiety of LPS is active in this process, we colonized juvenile squid with a mutant lacking the O-antigen (waaL) and compared the microvillar density in those animals at 48 h with that in animals colonized with wild-type (WT) V. fischeri and animals left uncolonized (Apo) (Fig. 5C). Microvillar density did not differ significantly between the WT and waaL-colonized animals (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the O-antigen does not play a role in the induction of the process. To determine whether phosphorylation of the lipid A is necessary for the induction of microvillar growth in the light organ, we treated the LPS with alkaline phosphatase (AP) or with heat-inactivated AP as a control (Fig. 5C). We then exposed juvenile animals to both LPS preparations and compared the microvillar densities of treated animals with those of animals colonized with WT V. fischeri and those left aposymbiotic. Microvillar density was significantly lower in aposymbiotic animals and those exposed to AP-treated LPS relative to animals colonized with the WT strain and those exposed to LPS treated with heat-inactivated AP. However, the microvillar density of animals exposed to AP-treated LPS was slightly but significantly higher than that of aposymbiotic animals (P<0.05), suggesting that either not all of the phosphate groups were cleaved from the LPS molecule during AP treatment or that another portion of the V. fischeri LPS molecule works together with the phosphorylated lipid A to affect host crypt-cell microvillar density.Discussion The results of this study on the squid-vibrio symbiosis, which exploited the capability to manipulate juvenile animals experimentally, provide evidence that (i) effacement of the brush border occurs daily around dawn in juveniles and persists throughout the life time of the host; (ii) the trigger for this effacement is the light cue of dawn and is independent of symbiosis; (iii) the monotonic increase in microvillar density at dawn in juveniles requires V. fischeri colonization, but is not dependent on level of colonization or luminescence capacity of the symbionts; and (iv) this increase in density is induced by phosphorylated lipid A. These data, when integrated with past contributions, provide a new model for the diurnal and developmental dynamics of the crypt brush border in the squid-vibrio symbiosis. Microvillar shedding as a response to environmental light cues Whereas in pathogenic associations, such as EPEC, colonization induces a single, terminal effacement of the microvilli, effacement is independent of the symbionts in the squid-vibrio symbiosis. Instead, evidence presented here suggests that the brush border effacement of the squid light organ, which is embryonically gut derived (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1993), requires a light cue. Circadian rhythms, which are principally entrained by light cues, control numerous cellular processes of the mammalian gut (Froy, 2011), although, to our knowledge, the influences of rhythms on brush-border ultrastructure and cues that might mediate any such changes have not been reported. However, the light-cued central clock of the brain entrains the peripheral clock that, in turn, regulates epithelial function of the intestine (Pacha and Sumova, 2013). As such, analysis of the mammalian intestinal epithelium for changes in the brush-border microarchitecture in response to environmental light cues, independent of the microbiota, may be a fruitful research avenue. The daily effacement of the brush border may not be a ‘hard-wired’ feature associated with evolutionary selection on symbiosis in the squid-vibrio system, but instead may be related to convergence of the light organ with the eye. Several studies have focused on the structural and functional similarities of these organs. Although the eye is photoreceptive and the light organ is photogenic, they have similar accessory tissues to modify light (Crookes et al., 2004; Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1992), as well as similar biochemistry and developmental induction (Peyer et al., 2014; Tong et al., 2009). Relevant here is that the shedding of microvilli in response to light is common in the rhabdomeric photoreceptors that are characteristic of certain invertebrate eyes, including those of cephalopods (Battelle, 2013; Gray et al., 2008; Stark et al., 1988). The renewal of portions of photoreceptors is common in both invertebrate and vertebrate eyes as a response to the photo-oxidative reactions that can ultimately lead to retinal degeneration (Jinks et al., 1998; Strauss, 2005). The behaviour shedding of the microvilli in rhabdomeric eyes thus serves to renew the microvilli of the retinal cells each day. As with other characters of the light organ that appear to be co-opted from the eye, effacement behaviour may serve a similar function, i.e., to renew the host’s cellular interface with the bacterial partner on a daily basis in response to oxidative stress imposed by the symbiosis (Ruby and McFall-Ngai, 1999). Although the effacement behaviour of the crypt brush border of juveniles does not require the interaction with symbionts, we cannot rule out a role for triggering this behaviour in the light organ of mature animals. Recent studies of the system have demonstrated that the organ undergoes maturation over the first few weeks of the symbiosis, which results in a dramatic change in its biochemistry. Notably, at ~4 weeks, a rhythm of symbiont metabolism ensues that correlates with a daily acidification and a change in the oxygen availability in the crypts (Schwartzman et al., 2015). Whereas the relative anatomical and biochemical simplicity of the juvenile organ revealed the lack of a role of the symbiont in effacement, the complexity of the adult organ renders such a determination challenging, if not impossible.Symbiont-induced hypertrophy of epithelial brush borders The form and function of the terminal web of polarized epithelia is a principal target of bacterial symbionts, a phenomenon that has been best studied in pathogens. In many cases, bacterial alterations of the brush border result in a more intimate association of the bacterial cells with host cell membranes, similar to what has been observed in early colonization of the squid-host crypts by V. fischeri (Fig. S1). For example, the attaching and effacing activity of EPEC and enterohemorrhagic E. coli is followed by a complex set of events in which the pathogen hijacks the host cytoskeleton to produce ‘pedestals’ at the site of attachment that cradle the pathogen (DeVinney et al., 2001; Gruber and Sperandio, 2014; Gruenheid et al., 2001) and promote pathogenesis (Aroeti et al., 2012). More subtle effects occur with the early colonization of nasopharyngeal epithelia by Neisseria meningitidis; following attachment to the epithelium, this opportunistic pathogen recruits host cytoskeletal proteins to induce elongation of the brush-border microvilli (Higashi et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 1983). Although these phenomena have been studied for decades in pathogens, new data demonstrate that normal colonization by the microbiota can also affect the brush border; manipulation of the microbiota diversity and abundance by antibiotics and probiotics can influence the density of intestinal-cell epithelia (Cerezuela et al., 2012; Chichlowski et al., 2007; Kuhlwein et al., 2013; Ringø et al., 2007; Shukla et al., 2012). Both biochemical and biophysical features of bacteria have been implicated in induction of brush-border remodelling. Several bacterial pathogens, such as EPEC, use type III secretion systems to introduce effector molecules directly into host-cell cytoplasm (Coburn et al., 2007). In a study of N. meningitidis pathogenesis, the biophysical force exerted by type IV pili was implicated in driving the elongation of the microvilli (Higashi et al., 2009), but the precise mechanism of this action was not determined. A recent study of EPEC, which also requires type IV pili for virulence, has shown that the influence of the biophysical forces exerted by the pili is likely indirect (Aroeti et al., 2012). The data provide evidence that the pili serve simply to draw the pathogen closer to the host cell membranes, which promotes the opportunity for full virulence of the type III secretion system. Such phenomena may occur in the squid-vibrio system, wherein presentation of lipid A requires interaction of host cells with symbiont pili; V. fischeri encodes eight type IV pili (Ruby et al., 2005) that may function individually or in combination to facilitate signalling and colonization (Stabb and Ruby, 2003). Although MAMPs, including LPS (e.g., Isowa et al., 1999; Gutiérrez-Venegas et al., 2008; Kleveta et al., 2012), have been shown to perturb the cytoskeletal network of host cells, they have not been implicated directly in remodelling of the brush border. The observation that phosphorylated lipid A is required for the developmental increase in brush-border microvillar density adds to a long list of MAMP-induced developmental phenotypes in the host squid (McFall-Ngai et al., 2010). Lipid A works in synergy with the peptidoglycan monomer to induce apoptosis and morphogenesis of the superficial ciliated epithelium that potentiates colonization (Koropatnick et al., 2004). We have determined that symbiont MAMPs are inducers of many host-squid developmental phenotypes, but much work remains to be carried out to elucidate how the MAMPs are delivered to and recognized by host cells. A recent study of the system demonstrated that outer membrane vesicles contain MAMPs and that host cells take up these vesicles (Aschtgen et al., 2015). The molecular basis of how these outer membrane vesicles signal to the host may be through the light-organ pattern-recognition receptors. The light organ expresses numerous pattern-recognition receptors (McFall-Ngai et al., 2010). One of these, a LPS binding protein, EsLBP1, binds V. fischeri LPS, and the gene that encodes for this protein is upregulated about 20-fold in the crypt spaces in response to peptidoglycan derivatives, and not LPS, of the colonizing symbiont (Krasity et al., 2015). The role that this LPS ligand plays in the induction of LPS-mediated changes in the host brush border remains to be determined. We have not defined here how lipid A mediates these changes in the crypt brush border, but we have established a link to the daily rhythms of these tissues. These data complement another recent study of the system, which demonstrated a daily regulation of host AP activity (Rader et al., 2012). Several contributions report that the activity of secreted host AP dephosphorylates, and thus ‘detoxifies’, lipid A in symbiotic systems, including the squid-vibrio association and the intestinal-microbiota symbioses of the vertebrate gut (Bates et al., 2007). AP activity fluctuates over the day–night cycle in both juveniles and adults, being highest mid-day, and low around the time of effacement (Fig. 6A). These data would suggest that phosphorylated lipid A delivers the signal for microvilli regrowth around dawn. Studies of the host transcriptome over the day–night cycle demonstrate that genes encoding host cytoskeletal proteins are upregulated in the hours before dawn (Wier et al., 2010), suggesting that the tissues are biochemically primed for the lipid A signal of the symbiont. Finally, in recent studies of both pathogens and members of the microbiota, the dephosphylation of their lipid A renders them more resistant to the activity of antimicrobial peptides (Cullen et al., 2015; Herrera et al., 2014), a consequence that may also occur in the squid-vibrio symbiosis. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Model for crypt brush border dynamics in early development through maturation of the light organ. A. Early development. Unlike the monotonic increase first suggested by an earlier study (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998), analysis of the system over the day–night cycle predicts effacement and regrowth each day over the first several days in both aposymbiotic (Apo, red lines) and symbiotic (Sym, blue lines) animals. In the symbiotic animals, the regrowth includes an increase in microvillar density. Incorporating data from a study of AP activity show that it remains low in aposymbiotic (Apo, red bars) animals and is low in symbiotic animals around dawn, but is high in symbiotic animals (Sym, blue bars) mid-day. B. The established daily rhythm of the host brush border, with most of the remodelling events occurring in the hours surrounding dawn.A new model of brush border dynamics The data provided here, along with those of earlier studies (notably, Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998; Wier et al., 2010, and Rader et al., 2012), allow us to construct a detailed model of the brush border in early development and over the day–night cycle through the life of the host (Fig. 6). The early symbiosis is a time of rapid changes in the light organ with an underlying daily rhythm (Fig. 6A) of effacement and augmented regrowth, with associated fluctuations in AP activity, which mediate a cycle of phosphorylation on the LPS molecule. The complexity of the brush-border ultrastructure of adult crypt epithelia does not suggest that the microvilli continue to increase in their density over the several months of the squid’s life at the rate observed in the first days of the symbiosis. Instead, it appears that the mature association settles down into a rhythm of effacement and regrowth, with much of the critical underlying biochemistry occurring in the hours before and after dawn (Fig. 6B). Future investigations will focus both upon the signalling pathways activated by symbiont lipid A and on the participation of circadian rhythms in the shaping of the brush border. In addition, investigation of other features of the symbiont, such as pili, that may be required for the effective presentation of MAMPs, will be explored. Both bacteria-induced development and bacteria-entrained daily rhythms mediated by clock genes were first described in the squid-vibrio symbiosis and later found in vertebrates (Bouskra et al., 2008; Leone et al., 2015). As such, studies of whether the processes described in this contribution also occur in vertebrates may reveal important features of animal-bacterial interactions that are conserved over evolutionary time.Experimental procedures General methods Adult E. scolopes were collected and maintained as previously described (Wollenberg and Ruby, 2012). Juveniles from the breeding colony were collected within 15 min of hatching. Aposymbiotic (Apo) animals were maintained in V. fischeri-free, unfiltered seawater. To produce the symbiotic (Sym) condition, juveniles were exposed to a given V. fischeri strain (Table 1) overnight at ~5000 colony-forming units per millilitre of seawater. Colonization state was confirmed by measuring ± luminescence output of the host with a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). In experiments with V. fischeri surface molecules, the LPS and the peptidoglycan monomer, TCT, were prepared as previously described (Foster et al., 2000; Koropatnick et al., 2004) and exposed to animals at 10 µg ml−1 and 10 µm respectively. In experiments to study the venting of luminous V. fischeri into the surrounding seawater, we removed the squid host from the vial, measured the luminescence of the squid-free seawater, and then returned the squid back into the vial. For these experiments, in addition to a given light-dark regime, animals were maintained in constant red light, which is not perceived by the animal’s visual system, but can be seen by the person manipulating the animals. All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted. All animal experiments conform to the relevant regulatory standards established by the University of Wisconsin – Madison. Table 1. Vibrio fischeri strains used in this study.

The samples were then washed in mPBS, dehydrated in an ethanol series and embedded in Spurr’s resin. Sections were visualized on a Philips CM120 Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope. Juvenile squid was prepared for immunocytochemistry as previously described (Weis et al., 1993). A polyclonal LPS antibody was used at a 1:100 dilution for 7 h in a humid chamber. Samples were examined by TEM.Quantification of microvillar density and cellular swelling Quantification of microvillar density was performed as previously described (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998). Briefly, seven 5 µm fields within the largest, most mature crypt of a juvenile light organ were visualized by TEM, and all microvilli attached to epithelial cells in each field were counted to yield the linear density of microvilli, which was extrapolated to derive the microvillar density per unit area (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1994). Three squid light organs were analysed for each condition. Cell swelling was determined by measuring the width of epithelial cells of the crypt. As aforementioned, seven cells were measured per light organ, and three light organs were measured per condition. All statistical comparisons were performed on the linear density using Graphpad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla CA).Lipopolysaccharide dephosphorylation Vibrio fischeri LPS was dephosphorylated using a protocol adapted from Bates et al., 2007. Briefly, five units of calf AP conjugated to agarose beads were suspended in PBS (50 mM sodium phosphate with 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.4), and then exposed to 100 µg V. fischeri LPS in PBS. The sample was then incubated at 37°C for 4 h, and then the beads were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant containing the de-phosphorylated LPS was recovered. As a negative control, the same procedure was followed with calf AP that had been heat-inactivated at 70°C for 10 min. Supernatants from both samples, at a final LPS concentration of 10 µg ml−1 of seawater, were exposed to the juvenile squid for 48 h.Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank B. August and R.

    "abstract": "Significance Animal–microbe associations are critical drivers of evolutionary innovation, yet the origin of specialized symbiotic organs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the genome of Euprymna scolopes, a model cephalopod, and observed large-scale genomic reorganizations compared with the ancestral bilaterian genome. We report distinct evolutionary signatures within the two symbiotic organs of E. scolopes, the light organ (LO) and the accessory nidamental gland (ANG). The LO evolved through subfunctionalization of genes expressed in the eye, indicating a deep evolutionary link between these organs. Alternatively, the ANG was enriched in novel, species-specific orphan genes suggesting these two tissues originated via different evolutionary strategies. These analyses represent the first genomic insights into the evolution of multiple symbiotic organs within a single animal host.

    "methods": "Materials and Methods Data Access. Genome and transcriptome sequencing reads have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive as Bioproject PRJNA470951. Genome Sequencing and Assembly. Genomic DNA generated in this study was derived from a single adult male E. scolopes (SI Appendix). Illumina reads from several libraries (SI Appendix, Table S1) were assembled with Meraculous resulting in a preliminary assembly; scaffolds were generated using the in vitro chromatin conformation capture (Chicago) at Dovetail Genomics. Gene Model Predictions. Gene prediction models were generated using Augustus training with transcriptomic data. The prediction was filtered to exclude sequences that overlap with masked repeats over at least 50% of the lengths. From the remaining models, those with support from transcript evidence and significant homology to metazoan protein sequences were included in the nonredundant database. This gene modeling set was combined with transcriptome mapping (SI Appendix, Table S2) resulting in 29,089 protein sequences that passed the filtering stage. Transcriptome Sequencing. Thirty-one transcriptomes of E. scolopes were included in the reference transcriptome and sample metadata of the tissues and time points is provided in SI Appendix, Table S1. Different RNA extractions and sequencing platforms were used and are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1. For the tissue-specific transcriptomes, RNA was extracted from ANG, brain, eyes, gills, hemocytes, LO, and skin tissues, as well as juvenile head (white body, optic nerve, and brain), eyes, gills, and light organ. For the PacBio IsoSeq library, RNA was extracted, normalized, and pooled from adult brain, eyes, white body, optical lobe, gills, LO, and skin as well as whole juvenile hatchling, 24-h aposymbiotic, and 24-h symbiotic animals (SI Appendix, Table S1). Synteny Analysis. Using previously published methods of phylogeny-informed clustering, we have constructed the sets of orthologous gene families between the following species (11): Capitella teleta, Helobdella robusta, Lottia gigantea, Octopus bimaculoides, Euprymna scolopes, Crassostrea gigas, Nematostella vectensis, and Branchiostoma floridae. To account for differential gene loss that may impede our quantification of synteny loss/gain we focused only on 3,547 clusters that have an ortholog from each of the species. We have implemented microsynteny detection algorithm, as described in Simakov et al. (11), and found, in accordance with previous results (10, 34), ∼600 microsyntenic blocks (in 163 orthologous groups) that can be traced back to the bilaterian ancestor because they are shared between either both ingroups (protostome and deuterostome) or an ingroup and an outgroup species (Nematostella) (Dataset S1).",
    "results": "Results and Discussion Our sequencing efforts have resulted in the most comprehensive cephalopod genome assembly to date, revealing the expansive and highly repetitive nature of the E. scolopes genome. Using a hybrid approach of shotgun and long-range linkage sequencing methods, an assembly estimated to be 5.1 Gigabases (Gb) was generated with a total half of the assembly in scaffolds of 3.7 Mb or longer (N50). The genome annotation was guided by 31 RNA-seq (Illumina) and ISO-seq (PacBio) transcriptomic libraries prepared from diverse tissues and developmental stages (SI Appendix, Table S1). The annotation resulted in 29,259 expressed protein-coding genes that yielded a BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) (9) score of 97% against the eukaryotic core set (Materials and Methods). A table summarizing the key statistics and a comparison with the O. bimaculoides genome is provided in SI Appendix, Table S2. Genome analysis revealed differing histories of repeat element expansions between the bobtail squid and octopus, which may have contributed to the observed divergence in genome size (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Although the estimated proportion of repetitive elements was >50% in both species, the abundance within individual repetitive element classes was strikingly different across the two species. Specifically, the abundance of long and short interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs and SINEs, respectively) differed; LINEs were the most abundant repeat class in E. scolopes, whereas SINEs dominated in O. bimaculoides (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). Gene families in E. scolopes are similar to those reported in O. bimaculoides and also include tandem expansions in protocadherins and zinc finger transcription factors (SI Appendix, Fig. S2) (10). We infer that the last common coleoid cephalopod ancestor had 7,650 gene families, similar to the previously reported estimates for spiralian and bilaterian ancestors (10, 11). Because we do not find signatures of whole-genome duplication or evidence of extensive horizontal gene transfer in E. scolopes, the difference in the genome sizes between octopus and bobtail squid can be attributed to the increased LINE content in the E. scolopes genome. Future sequencing of other Decapodiformes genomes should enable a more exact estimate of this repeat element expansion. The E. scolopes genome revealed key genomic transitions toward cephalopod genomic architecture. We find that over half of the local gene linkages (i.e., microsynteny) conserved across many noncephalopod bilaterian genomes were disrupted in both O. bimaculoides and E. scolopes, indicating that a large genomic reorganization took place in the cephalopod ancestor (Fig. 2A). Additionally, we found numerous linkages shared between octopus and the bobtail squid that have not been previously identified in other animal genomes (Fig. 2 B and C). Those linkages contain genes expressed in highly developed organ systems (e.g., the central nervous system) as well as in symbiotic organs from E. scolopes and testes of O. bimacuolides (Fig. 2C). In total, this taxon-specific microsynteny constituted 67% (126 out of 189) of all conserved syntenic linkages in both cephalopod genomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 and Table S2). Fig. 2.

(D) A large partial hox cluster on two separate scaffolds was recovered, totaling to a length of at least 16 Mb. Branchiostoma floridae hox cluster is shown for comparison with colors indicating orthologous genes. The improved contiguity of the genome assembly also uncovered the presence of a partial hox cluster in E. scolopes with very large (1.5–2 Mb) intergenic distances that is in stark contrast to the previously reported atomized hox cluster in the octopus genome (10). These are to our knowledge the longest inter hox-gene separations (Fig. 2D) known in animals and are consistent with the long, gene-free regions surrounding hox genes in O. bimaculoides (10) and the identified expansion of repetitive elements. Such large intergenic distances may be responsible for the evolution of unique regulatory mechanisms. This hypothesis is further supported by unconventional hox gene expression in E. scolopes (12). To understand how this genome reorganization drove the evolution of symbiotic organs in E. scolopes, we studied genomic signatures of genes with tissue-specific expression in symbiotic versus nonsymbiotic organs. To identify possible candidate genes that evolved in symbiotic organs after a duplication event, we searched the E. scolopes genome for all paralogous pairs of genes in which one gene had tissue-specific expression and the second did not. Using these genes, we then calculated the number of synonymous substitutions (dS) between each gene pair (Fig. 3). We found that for the LO and ANG, the dS distance between tissue-specific genes and the respective closest non-LO and non-ANG paralog was relatively small [dS < 1, ∼130 Mya, using a calibration point from Albertin et al. (10)]. These distances were in sharp contrast compared with genes specific to the eye and brain, which were much older (dS > 2, squid–octopus divergence, ∼270 Mya) (10, 13). These paralog ages are consistent with a scenario in which the ANG and LO, which harbor dense populations of bacteria, underwent relatively recent innovations within the bobtail squid lineage through gene duplication, compared with the more ancient duplications of genes that are involved in development and function of cephalopod eyes and the nervous system. Fig. 3.

(Lower) Joy plot of the synonymous substitutions distances (dS) between the genes specifically expressed in a given tissue to their closest paralog expressed elsewhere.

(C) Venn diagram representing the number of shared transcripts among LO, ANG, and eye tissues identifying a significant overlap between LO and eye transcripts. The main mechanism behind gene duplication in O. bimaculoides is through tandem or segmental duplication (10). Genes exclusively expressed in either LO, eyes, or ANG were typically found in tandem clusters of paralogs located on single scaffolds. In particular, we found two gene clusters, the first composed of reflectins and the second of peroxidases that were expressed in the LO (see below, Fig. 4, and SI Appendix, Figs. S4–S6). In both cases, the tandem gene duplications forming those clusters were E. scolopes-specific and occurred after the octopus–squid split, consistent with the emergence of ANG and LO in the subsequent squid lineage. A large 2-Mb cluster of S-crystallins, which are predominantly expressed in the eyes (SI Appendix, Fig. S7), was expanded in tandem in E. scolopes but was missing from the octopus genome. The omega-crystallins, which are typically found in the LO and the eyes of E. scolopes, on the other hand, did not show signs of any expansion (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). The characteristic cluster in the ANG (∼1 Mb) contained both novel genes and transposable elements. Overall, there were significantly more tandemly duplicated genes expressed in the LO and eyes compared with the number of the tandemly clustered genes specifically expressed in other tissues (Fisher’s exact test P < 0.001), which underscores the importance of gene duplication for those organ systems.

(C) Tandem clusters of reflectin and peroxidase genes in the E. scolopes genome. Scaffold ID and approximate location (kbp) is shown for each gene (represented by rectangle). Colors correspond to the sequences on the trees in A for reflectins and (B) for peroxidases. Our data also reveal that despite the broad phylogenetic distribution among cephalopods (14), the ANG of E. scolopes is highly derived and shows an elevated evolutionary accumulation in both its coding (novel gene formation) and noncoding (turnover of the regulatory sequence) complements. The ANG is a secretory organ within the female reproductive system containing a bacterial consortium that is deposited into the egg capsule and is believed to play a role in defense from fouling and/or pathogens during embryogenesis (7, 8, 15, 16). Taxonomically restricted (i.e., orphan) genes have contributed to the evolution of unique tissues and organs in a number of animals (17–19). Within the two symbiotic organs of E. scolopes (LO and ANG), we profiled protein-coding transcripts that mapped to genome scaffolds from tissue-specific transcriptomes against the ’s nonredundant database [using BLASTP (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool - Protein) e-value threshold of 1E-5; Fig. 3A] and classified the transcripts as either E. scolopes-specific, cephalopod, molluscan, bilaterian, metazoan, or premetazoan (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). The ANG had the highest proportion of E. scolopes-specific transcripts (>35%) among all tissues. Additionally, regions 20 kb up- and down-stream of genes specifically expressed in the ANG also showed a higher proportion of repetitive element content compared with genes expressed in any other tissue (Fig. 3B), suggesting a high evolutionary turnover in regulatory regions. These higher rates of genomic innovation, specific to the E. scolopes ANG genes, are also supported by our analysis of previously reported ANG transcriptomes from both E. scolopes and the (loliginid) swordtip squid, Uroteuthis edulis, the latter of which had fewer unique genes specific to this organ (SI Appendix, Fig. S8) (20). Within the LO of E. scolopes, there were several other genetic signatures contributing to the distinctive features of this symbiotic organ. First, the dominant transcripts within the light organ were reflectins (Fig. 4A), providing strong support for previous studies indicating that the anatomical features used to modulate light in the LO are similar to the eye, as are their physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and developmental induction (21–23). A comparison of adult LO and eye transcriptomes supports these previous studies (Figs. 3C and 4A). Identified reflectins (Fig. 4A) were almost exclusively (>99.99% of total expression) expressed in the LO, eyes, and skin. LO expression constituted around 19.5% of the total reflectin expression, whereas eyes and skin composed 72.8% and 7.6%, respectively. Reflectins usually shared two or more expression domains and were rarely expressed in a single tissue. The majority of genes showed a distinctive LO and eyes expression domain, and no reflectins were expressed exclusively in both LO and skin (Fig. 4 A and C). Evolutionary timing of the LO–eye reflectin clusters may thus hint at the origin of the LO. Molecular dating analysis using branch length and squid–octopus split as a calibration point (10, 13) revealed the age of those clusters at around 30 Mya or younger. Additionally, among the genomic expansion of 14 peroxidases unique to E. scolopes (Fig. 4 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S6), six genes [including a previously reported halide peroxidase (24, 25)] formed a single genomic cluster expressed exclusively in the light organ. Unlike reflectins, this expansion did not form a monophyletic group, suggesting high gain or loss of genes within this family, or gene conversion. The host is known to produce a halide peroxidase that is expressed in the LO and generates hypohalous acid, a potent antimicrobial compound thought to contribute to specificity in the squid–vibrio association (26, 27). This peroxidase, along with several others, is expressed in the tissues directly in contact with V. fischeri (28, 29). The expansion of the peroxidases and the unique expression of a subset of these genes exclusively in the LO may reflect the development of a unique microenvironment that helps to maintain specificity with V. fischeri (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Analysis of protein families also revealed a number of genes that had multiple immune-associated domains, many of which were expressed in the LO, ANG, and skin (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). All three of these tissues interact directly with environmental and/or symbiotic microorganisms. A number of cellular and biochemical components of the innate immune system are known to play critical roles in mediating specificity in the LO symbiosis with V. fischeri (30–32). Previous observations of host hemocytes infiltrating the ANG (7), along with expression of immune-related genes reported here, suggest that the host’s immune system plays a critical role in this symbiotic organ as well. Although bacterial LOs are restricted to just two families of cephalopods (sepiolids and loliginids), the ANG is a more broadly distributed organ, present in these and a number of other squid and cuttlefish species (Fig. 1C). Their distinct evolutionary histories and origins are supported by the different evolutionary patterns detected. The prevalence of functional novelty through gene duplication in the LO compared with taxon-specific genes in the ANG suggests two different patterns of genomic innovation underlying symbiotic organ evolution in E. scolopes. Because these two associations are not nutritionally coupled, the mechanisms for the evolution of these symbiotic organs may be different from what has been proposed for insect bacteriocytes where metabolic complementation appears to be the major driver of innovation (33). Rapid gene evolution and/or gene loss in ancestral lineages may also have contributed to these unique signatures, especially in the ANG. Together, the presence of these two distinctive tissues within E. scolopes renders it a unique model organism to investigate the genetic mechanisms associated with the evolution of symbiotic organs (34).",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions Our analyses of the Hawaiian bobtail squid genome revealed large-scale genome reorganization, which preceded the coleoid cephalopod radiation, and provide evidence for two different patterns of genomic evolution that contributed to functional novelty. First, the extensive structural reorganization through the loss of ancient bilaterian microsynteny and increase in genome size through repetitive element expansions resulted in a unique genomic architecture that may have contributed to the innovations in the general cephalopod body plan. Second, the coding and surrounding regulatory regions of microbe-associated tissues suggest distinctive evolutionary patterns, such as the expansion of genes associated with immunity and light production in the LO. In the ANG, the prevalence of taxon-specific, or orphan, gene expression suggests a highly derived organ that evolved by a different means than the LO, perhaps due to unique selection pressures. Overall, our results set the stage for further functional analysis of genomic innovations that led to the evolution of symbiotic organs in a morphologically and behaviorally complex clade.",

Significance Animal–microbe associations are critical drivers of evolutionary innovation, yet the origin of specialized symbiotic organs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the genome of Euprymna scolopes, a model cephalopod, and observed large-scale genomic reorganizations compared with the ancestral bilaterian genome. We report distinct evolutionary signatures within the two symbiotic organs of E. scolopes, the light organ (LO) and the accessory nidamental gland (ANG). The LO evolved through subfunctionalization of genes expressed in the eye, indicating a deep evolutionary link between these organs. Alternatively, the ANG was enriched in novel, species-specific orphan genes suggesting these two tissues originated via different evolutionary strategies. These analyses represent the first genomic insights into the evolution of multiple symbiotic organs within a single animal host. Keywords: cephalopods, symbiosis, evolution, genomics, transcriptomicsAbstract Microbes have been critical drivers of evolutionary innovation in animals. To understand the processes that influence the origin of specialized symbiotic organs, we report the sequencing and analysis of the genome of Euprymna scolopes, a model cephalopod with richly characterized host–microbe interactions. We identified large-scale genomic reorganization shared between E. scolopes and Octopus bimaculoides and posit that this reorganization has contributed to the evolution of cephalopod complexity. To reveal genomic signatures of host–symbiont interactions, we focused on two specialized organs of E. scolopes: the light organ, which harbors a monoculture of Vibrio fischeri, and the accessory nidamental gland (ANG), a reproductive organ containing a bacterial consortium. Our findings suggest that the two symbiotic organs within E. scolopes originated by different evolutionary mechanisms. Transcripts expressed in these microbe-associated tissues displayed their own unique signatures in both coding sequences and the surrounding regulatory regions. Compared with other tissues, the light organ showed an abundance of genes associated with immunity and mediating light, whereas the ANG was enriched in orphan genes known only from E. scolopes. Together, these analyses provide evidence for different patterns of genomic evolution of symbiotic organs within a single host. Numerous organisms have specialized organs to house their microbiota, yet the evolutionary processes underlying the origin of these tissues are not well understood (1–4). The Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, is a tractable animal model that has proven invaluable for interrogating symbiotic relationships and revealing common mechanisms by which successful colonization of animal epithelia by bacteria is established and maintained (Fig. 1A) (5). In the light organ (LO) of E. scolopes, a monospecific association with the bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri provides camouflage for the host and triggers a coordinated developmental remodeling of the surrounding epithelial tissues (6). Additionally, E. scolopes harbors a complex microbial consortium in the accessory nidamental gland (ANG), a component of the female reproductive system of many squids and cuttlefish that is hypothesized to play a role in egg defense (Fig. 1B) (7, 8). Octopus bimaculoides, the other cephalopod for which a genome has been reported to date, has neither a light organ nor an ANG making it an ideal organism for comparison (Fig. 1C). Therefore, to define elements of genome structure and function that are critical for symbiosis and the evolution of cephalopods, we sequenced and characterized the E. scolopes genome, the first example from the superorder Decapodiformes.

Branch lengths are derived from Tanner et al. (35).Results and Discussion Our sequencing efforts have resulted in the most comprehensive cephalopod genome assembly to date, revealing the expansive and highly repetitive nature of the E. scolopes genome. Using a hybrid approach of shotgun and long-range linkage sequencing methods, an assembly estimated to be 5.1 Gigabases (Gb) was generated with a total half of the assembly in scaffolds of 3.7 Mb or longer (N50). The genome annotation was guided by 31 RNA-seq (Illumina) and ISO-seq (PacBio) transcriptomic libraries prepared from diverse tissues and developmental stages (SI Appendix, Table S1). The annotation resulted in 29,259 expressed protein-coding genes that yielded a BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) (9) score of 97% against the eukaryotic core set (Materials and Methods). A table summarizing the key statistics and a comparison with the O. bimaculoides genome is provided in SI Appendix, Table S2. Genome analysis revealed differing histories of repeat element expansions between the bobtail squid and octopus, which may have contributed to the observed divergence in genome size (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Although the estimated proportion of repetitive elements was >50% in both species, the abundance within individual repetitive element classes was strikingly different across the two species. Specifically, the abundance of long and short interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs and SINEs, respectively) differed; LINEs were the most abundant repeat class in E. scolopes, whereas SINEs dominated in O. bimaculoides (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). Gene families in E. scolopes are similar to those reported in O. bimaculoides and also include tandem expansions in protocadherins and zinc finger transcription factors (SI Appendix, Fig. S2) (10). We infer that the last common coleoid cephalopod ancestor had 7,650 gene families, similar to the previously reported estimates for spiralian and bilaterian ancestors (10, 11). Because we do not find signatures of whole-genome duplication or evidence of extensive horizontal gene transfer in E. scolopes, the difference in the genome sizes between octopus and bobtail squid can be attributed to the increased LINE content in the E. scolopes genome. Future sequencing of other Decapodiformes genomes should enable a more exact estimate of this repeat element expansion. The E. scolopes genome revealed key genomic transitions toward cephalopod genomic architecture. We find that over half of the local gene linkages (i.e., microsynteny) conserved across many noncephalopod bilaterian genomes were disrupted in both O. bimaculoides and E. scolopes, indicating that a large genomic reorganization took place in the cephalopod ancestor (Fig. 2A). Additionally, we found numerous linkages shared between octopus and the bobtail squid that have not been previously identified in other animal genomes (Fig. 2 B and C). Those linkages contain genes expressed in highly developed organ systems (e.g., the central nervous system) as well as in symbiotic organs from E. scolopes and testes of O. bimacuolides (Fig. 2C). In total, this taxon-specific microsynteny constituted 67% (126 out of 189) of all conserved syntenic linkages in both cephalopod genomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 and Table S2). Fig. 2.

Squares (black/white) connected by lines above the nodes indicate two hypothetical microsyntenic blocks illustrating a common scenario where conserved bilaterian and lophotrochozoan synteny is disrupted (crossed lines) followed by the emergence of a new order through rearrangement in the cephalopod stem lineage.

(D) A large partial hox cluster on two separate scaffolds was recovered, totaling to a length of at least 16 Mb. Branchiostoma floridae hox cluster is shown for comparison with colors indicating orthologous genes.The improved contiguity of the genome assembly also uncovered the presence of a partial hox cluster in E. scolopes with very large (1.5–2 Mb) intergenic distances that is in stark contrast to the previously reported atomized hox cluster in the octopus genome (10). These are to our knowledge the longest inter hox-gene separations (Fig. 2D) known in animals and are consistent with the long, gene-free regions surrounding hox genes in O. bimaculoides (10) and the identified expansion of repetitive elements. Such large intergenic distances may be responsible for the evolution of unique regulatory mechanisms. This hypothesis is further supported by unconventional hox gene expression in E. scolopes (12). To understand how this genome reorganization drove the evolution of symbiotic organs in E. scolopes, we studied genomic signatures of genes with tissue-specific expression in symbiotic versus nonsymbiotic organs. To identify possible candidate genes that evolved in symbiotic organs after a duplication event, we searched the E. scolopes genome for all paralogous pairs of genes in which one gene had tissue-specific expression and the second did not. Using these genes, we then calculated the number of synonymous substitutions (dS) between each gene pair (Fig. 3). We found that for the LO and ANG, the dS distance between tissue-specific genes and the respective closest non-LO and non-ANG paralog was relatively small [dS < 1, ∼130 Mya, using a calibration point from Albertin et al. (10)]. These distances were in sharp contrast compared with genes specific to the eye and brain, which were much older (dS > 2, squid–octopus divergence, ∼270 Mya) (10, 13). These paralog ages are consistent with a scenario in which the ANG and LO, which harbor dense populations of bacteria, underwent relatively recent innovations within the bobtail squid lineage through gene duplication, compared with the more ancient duplications of genes that are involved in development and function of cephalopod eyes and the nervous system.

(Lower) Joy plot of the synonymous substitutions distances (dS) between the genes specifically expressed in a given tissue to their closest paralog expressed elsewhere.

(C) Venn diagram representing the number of shared transcripts among LO, ANG, and eye tissues identifying a significant overlap between LO and eye transcripts.The main mechanism behind gene duplication in O. bimaculoides is through tandem or segmental duplication (10). Genes exclusively expressed in either LO, eyes, or ANG were typically found in tandem clusters of paralogs located on single scaffolds. In particular, we found two gene clusters, the first composed of reflectins and the second of peroxidases that were expressed in the LO (see below, Fig. 4, and SI Appendix, Figs. S4–S6). In both cases, the tandem gene duplications forming those clusters were E. scolopes-specific and occurred after the octopus–squid split, consistent with the emergence of ANG and LO in the subsequent squid lineage. A large 2-Mb cluster of S-crystallins, which are predominantly expressed in the eyes (SI Appendix, Fig. S7), was expanded in tandem in E. scolopes but was missing from the octopus genome. The omega-crystallins, which are typically found in the LO and the eyes of E. scolopes, on the other hand, did not show signs of any expansion (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). The characteristic cluster in the ANG (∼1 Mb) contained both novel genes and transposable elements. Overall, there were significantly more tandemly duplicated genes expressed in the LO and eyes compared with the number of the tandemly clustered genes specifically expressed in other tissues (Fisher’s exact test P < 0.001), which underscores the importance of gene duplication for those organ systems.

Colors correspond to the sequences on the trees in A for reflectins and (B) for peroxidases.Our data also reveal that despite the broad phylogenetic distribution among cephalopods (14), the ANG of E. scolopes is highly derived and shows an elevated evolutionary accumulation in both its coding (novel gene formation) and noncoding (turnover of the regulatory sequence) complements. The ANG is a secretory organ within the female reproductive system containing a bacterial consortium that is deposited into the egg capsule and is believed to play a role in defense from fouling and/or pathogens during embryogenesis (7, 8, 15, 16). Taxonomically restricted (i.e., orphan) genes have contributed to the evolution of unique tissues and organs in a number of animals (17–19). Within the two symbiotic organs of E. scolopes (LO and ANG), we profiled protein-coding transcripts that mapped to genome scaffolds from tissue-specific transcriptomes against the ’s nonredundant database [using BLASTP (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool - Protein) e-value threshold of 1E-5; Fig. 3A] and classified the transcripts as either E. scolopes-specific, cephalopod, molluscan, bilaterian, metazoan, or premetazoan (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). The ANG had the highest proportion of E. scolopes-specific transcripts (>35%) among all tissues. Additionally, regions 20 kb up- and down-stream of genes specifically expressed in the ANG also showed a higher proportion of repetitive element content compared with genes expressed in any other tissue (Fig. 3B), suggesting a high evolutionary turnover in regulatory regions. These higher rates of genomic innovation, specific to the E. scolopes ANG genes, are also supported by our analysis of previously reported ANG transcriptomes from both E. scolopes and the (loliginid) swordtip squid, Uroteuthis edulis, the latter of which had fewer unique genes specific to this organ (SI Appendix, Fig. S8) (20). Within the LO of E. scolopes, there were several other genetic signatures contributing to the distinctive features of this symbiotic organ. First, the dominant transcripts within the light organ were reflectins (Fig. 4A), providing strong support for previous studies indicating that the anatomical features used to modulate light in the LO are similar to the eye, as are their physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and developmental induction (21–23). A comparison of adult LO and eye transcriptomes supports these previous studies (Figs. 3C and 4A). Identified reflectins (Fig. 4A) were almost exclusively (>99.99% of total expression) expressed in the LO, eyes, and skin. LO expression constituted around 19.5% of the total reflectin expression, whereas eyes and skin composed 72.8% and 7.6%, respectively. Reflectins usually shared two or more expression domains and were rarely expressed in a single tissue. The majority of genes showed a distinctive LO and eyes expression domain, and no reflectins were expressed exclusively in both LO and skin (Fig. 4 A and C). Evolutionary timing of the LO–eye reflectin clusters may thus hint at the origin of the LO. Molecular dating analysis using branch length and squid–octopus split as a calibration point (10, 13) revealed the age of those clusters at around 30 Mya or younger. Additionally, among the genomic expansion of 14 peroxidases unique to E. scolopes (Fig. 4 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S6), six genes [including a previously reported halide peroxidase (24, 25)] formed a single genomic cluster expressed exclusively in the light organ. Unlike reflectins, this expansion did not form a monophyletic group, suggesting high gain or loss of genes within this family, or gene conversion. The host is known to produce a halide peroxidase that is expressed in the LO and generates hypohalous acid, a potent antimicrobial compound thought to contribute to specificity in the squid–vibrio association (26, 27). This peroxidase, along with several others, is expressed in the tissues directly in contact with V. fischeri (28, 29). The expansion of the peroxidases and the unique expression of a subset of these genes exclusively in the LO may reflect the development of a unique microenvironment that helps to maintain specificity with V. fischeri (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Analysis of protein families also revealed a number of genes that had multiple immune-associated domains, many of which were expressed in the LO, ANG, and skin (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). All three of these tissues interact directly with environmental and/or symbiotic microorganisms. A number of cellular and biochemical components of the innate immune system are known to play critical roles in mediating specificity in the LO symbiosis with V. fischeri (30–32). Previous observations of host hemocytes infiltrating the ANG (7), along with expression of immune-related genes reported here, suggest that the host’s immune system plays a critical role in this symbiotic organ as well. Although bacterial LOs are restricted to just two families of cephalopods (sepiolids and loliginids), the ANG is a more broadly distributed organ, present in these and a number of other squid and cuttlefish species (Fig. 1C). Their distinct evolutionary histories and origins are supported by the different evolutionary patterns detected. The prevalence of functional novelty through gene duplication in the LO compared with taxon-specific genes in the ANG suggests two different patterns of genomic innovation underlying symbiotic organ evolution in E. scolopes. Because these two associations are not nutritionally coupled, the mechanisms for the evolution of these symbiotic organs may be different from what has been proposed for insect bacteriocytes where metabolic complementation appears to be the major driver of innovation (33). Rapid gene evolution and/or gene loss in ancestral lineages may also have contributed to these unique signatures, especially in the ANG. Together, the presence of these two distinctive tissues within E. scolopes renders it a unique model organism to investigate the genetic mechanisms associated with the evolution of symbiotic organs (34).Conclusions Our analyses of the Hawaiian bobtail squid genome revealed large-scale genome reorganization, which preceded the coleoid cephalopod radiation, and provide evidence for two different patterns of genomic evolution that contributed to functional novelty. First, the extensive structural reorganization through the loss of ancient bilaterian microsynteny and increase in genome size through repetitive element expansions resulted in a unique genomic architecture that may have contributed to the innovations in the general cephalopod body plan. Second, the coding and surrounding regulatory regions of microbe-associated tissues suggest distinctive evolutionary patterns, such as the expansion of genes associated with immunity and light production in the LO. In the ANG, the prevalence of taxon-specific, or orphan, gene expression suggests a highly derived organ that evolved by a different means than the LO, perhaps due to unique selection pressures. Overall, our results set the stage for further functional analysis of genomic innovations that led to the evolution of symbiotic organs in a morphologically and behaviorally complex clade.Materials and Methods Data Access. Genome and transcriptome sequencing reads have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive as Bioproject PRJNA470951.Genome Sequencing and Assembly. Genomic DNA generated in this study was derived from a single adult male E. scolopes (SI Appendix). Illumina reads from several libraries (SI Appendix, Table S1) were assembled with Meraculous resulting in a preliminary assembly; scaffolds were generated using the in vitro chromatin conformation capture (Chicago) at Dovetail Genomics.Gene Model Predictions. Gene prediction models were generated using Augustus training with transcriptomic data. The prediction was filtered to exclude sequences that overlap with masked repeats over at least 50% of the lengths. From the remaining models, those with support from transcript evidence and significant homology to metazoan protein sequences were included in the nonredundant database. This gene modeling set was combined with transcriptome mapping (SI Appendix, Table S2) resulting in 29,089 protein sequences that passed the filtering stage.Transcriptome Sequencing. Thirty-one transcriptomes of E. scolopes were included in the reference transcriptome and sample metadata of the tissues and time points is provided in SI Appendix, Table S1. Different RNA extractions and sequencing platforms were used and are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1. For the tissue-specific transcriptomes, RNA was extracted from ANG, brain, eyes, gills, hemocytes, LO, and skin tissues, as well as juvenile head (white body, optic nerve, and brain), eyes, gills, and light organ. For the PacBio IsoSeq library, RNA was extracted, normalized, and pooled from adult brain, eyes, white body, optical lobe, gills, LO, and skin as well as whole juvenile hatchling, 24-h aposymbiotic, and 24-h symbiotic animals (SI Appendix, Table S1).Synteny Analysis. Using previously published methods of phylogeny-informed clustering, we have constructed the sets of orthologous gene families between the following species (11): Capitella teleta, Helobdella robusta, Lottia gigantea, Octopus bimaculoides, Euprymna scolopes, Crassostrea gigas, Nematostella vectensis, and Branchiostoma floridae. To account for differential gene loss that may impede our quantification of synteny loss/gain we focused only on 3,547 clusters that have an ortholog from each of the species. We have implemented microsynteny detection algorithm, as described in Simakov et al. (11), and found, in accordance with previous results (10, 34), ∼600 microsyntenic blocks (in 163 orthologous groups) that can be traced back to the bilaterian ancestor because they are shared between either both ingroups (protostome and deuterostome) or an ingroup and an outgroup species (Nematostella) (Dataset S1).Supplementary Material Supplementary File pnas.1817322116.sapp.pdf (3.3MB, pdf) Supplementary File pnas.1817322116.sd01.xlsx (195.6KB, xlsx) Acknowledgments We thank Bo Reese from the Center for Genome Innovation, University of Connecticut (UCONN), for sequencing assistance and Jill Wegrzyn, Stephen King, and Ion Moraru of the Computational Biology Core, Institute for Systems Genomics, UCONN, for computational support.

    "title": "Modeled microgravity alters lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane vesicle production of the beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7940393/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Reduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology of animals, but the effects on their associated microbiomes are not well understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from V. fischeri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility. Mutants of V. fischeri defective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer-membrane integrity of V. fischeri, as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell-membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceflight.

    "introduction": "Introduction All animals form beneficial associations with microbes, and these symbioses, collectively called the microbiome, constitute a powerful determinant of development, health, and fitness1,2. Indeed, alterations in the composition of the microbiome, its secretion of bioactive metabolites, as well as the symbionts’ resultant with host systems (e.g., nervous, immune, endocrine) have been found to correlate with a variety of illnesses and disorders2–4. Understanding how mutualistic microbes adapt to stressful conditions within animal hosts, including humans, therefore, represents a crucial topic for microbiome research. One environment that presents numerous challenges to host–microbe homeostasis is spaceflight5. In particular, the microgravity conditions (10−6 × g) that astronauts experience during spaceflight have been shown to disrupt the normal physiology of the human body, including the intestinal microbiome6,7. This dysbiotic response is characterized by a decline in gut bacteria predicted to be protective, including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp.; the increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens like Escherichia coli, Enterobacteria spp., and Clostridia spp.; as well as shifts in the relative proportions of dominant taxa from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes6–12. In addition to measuring the relative abundance of various bacterial populations, many studies have also sought to determine the impact of the spaceflight on the physiology of those taxa. In this regard, microgravity and microgravity-analog conditions have been found to increase the resistance of opportunistic pathogens, such as E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to acid, heat, osmotic, and oxidative stresses13–15. Cultivation in these conditions is also known to promote biofilm formation and enhance the virulence of certain pathogens, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium16–19 and Serratia marcescens20. Though much progress has been made in delineating how pathogenic microbes respond to this unique stressor, the larger discussion of how beneficial microbes respond to microgravity has only recently begun to be examined21–27. One mutualistic association that has emerged as a tractable model by which to examine beneficial host–microbe interactions under modeled and natural microgravity conditions is the monospecific symbiosis between the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and its bioluminescent partner Vibrio fischeri21,24,28. Upon hatching, V. fischeri colonizes a specialized organ, known as the light organ, within the host animal and induces an irreversible remodeling of the symbiotic tissues29. The remodeling is marked by a pronounced apoptotic cell death event throughout the light organ’s superficial, ciliated epithelium30,31, a structure that is used to recruit symbiosis-competent V. fischeri from the environment and facilitate the onset of the association. Two microbe-associated molecular pattern signals (MAMPs) that have been identified as the primary mediators of the V. fischeri-induced apoptotic event in E. scolopes are LPS and the peptidoglycan-derived monomer, tracheal cytotoxin (TCT)32,33. These two MAMPs work synergistically to induce apoptosis and regression of the light organ’s ciliated epithelium during the onset of symbiosis33,34. Early-stage apoptosis within the host tissues, however, is primarily attributed to LPS32, and most of the LPS released by V. fischeri is embedded in outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) that are shed via rotation of the bacterium’s sheathed, polar, flagella (Fig. 1a–c)35,36. The rapid onset of MAMP-inducible phenotypes, combined with the binary nature of the light organ symbiosis, has rendered the squid-vibrio system a uniquely informative model for the study of animal-microbial mutualisms in microgravity22.

Several ground-based systems exist that enable microgravity-like conditions to be modeled, including high-aspect ratio vessels (HARVs). HARVs mimic the quiescent, low-shear, fluid conditions of spaceflight when rotated around a horizontal axis (Fig. 1d)22,37. Alternatively, rotation around a vertical axis is used to control for system-specific effects under normal Earth gravity conditions22,38. This low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment has been used to successfully mimic microgravity for decades, and has been correlated to results obtained during actual spaceflight13,23,37. Previous work with the squid-vibrio symbiosis using LSMMG has found that the normal symbiont-induced development of the light organ is altered by LSMMG21,23,24,27. Specifically, modeled microgravity accelerates both the onset and peak of apoptosis in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic, LPS-treated hatchlings21. Given the role of LPS in the normal bacteria-induced development of E. scolopes, these findings raised the possibility that LSMMG may alter MAMP-mediated channels of host–microbe communication. MAMPs are a crucial component of both beneficial and pathogenic interactions39; therefore, in this study, we examined the impact of LSMMG on the release of LPS and OMVs by V. fischeri, and assessed the overall physiology of the symbiont when cultivated under microgravity-like conditions. Examining the effects of modeled microgravity on beneficial microbes has the potential to both provide new insight on the underlying mechanisms of microgravity-induced dysbiosis and further our understanding of mutualistic host-microbe interactions during spaceflight.",
    "methods": "Methods Bacterial strains, media, and growth conditions The strains of V. fischeri used in this study include: wild-type V. fischeri ES11484; the non-motile, flagellated, mutant motB1::Tn7ermR; and the non-flagellated mutant flhA::Tn7ermR45. For all experiments, V. fischeri was grown in seawater tryptone broth (SWT; 70% filtered ocean water containing 5 g L−1 tryptone, 3 g L−1 yeast extract, and 32.5 mM glycerol) at 28 ˚C with shaking. Where appropriate, media was supplemented with erythromycin to a final concentration of 5 μg per mL. Retention of the transposon insertions in the motB1 and flhA motility mutants was verified for all experiments via soft-agar motility assays85. For assessments of growth, the concentration of V. fischeri was determined by reading the optical density at 600 nm, as an OD600 of 1.0 has been previously shown by plate counts to correspond with 3 × 108 cells per mL of culture84,86 and was independently confirmed in the HARVs. To ensure that background levels of OMVs did not significantly alter the OD600 readings, 1 mL of V. fischeri culture was filtered to remove bacteria using a 0.22 µm syringe filter and measured spectrophotometrically. No significant (p < 0.0001) difference in optical density was observed in the spent media from background SWT media. Electron microscopy All scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and transmission electron micrographs (TEM) were acquired at the University of Hawai’i Biological Electron Microscopy Facility. For SEM, V. fischeri were grown in SWT media to mid-log phase (OD600 0.4–0.6) with shaking at 28 °C. For TEM, cells were grown under similar conditions in LB salt (LBS) media containing 10 g L−1 tryptone, 5 g L−1 yeast extract, 342 mM NaCl, and 20 mM Tris at pH 7.5. Samples visualized with SEM were fixed with marine fixative containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 350 mM sucrose, 100 mM sodium cacodylate at pH 7.6 for 1 h. The cells were then washed in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer containing 400 mM sucrose and post-fixed with 100 mM sodium cacodylate containing 1% osmium tetraoxide for 1 h. After fixation the cells were collected on a 0.22-μm filter, then serially dehydrated in ethanol and dried with a Tousimis Samdri-795 critical point dryer. Filters were mounted on aluminum stubs and sputter coated with a Hummer 6.2 sputter coater, then imaged with a Hitachi S-4800 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope with accelerating voltage. TEM was performed as previously described68. Briefly, V. fischeri cells were fixed, washed, and post-fixed similarly to the samples prepared for SEM. Fixed V. fischeri cells were then serially dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, infiltrated with propylene oxide, then embedded and polymerized in LX112 epoxy resin for 2 days. Ultrathin sections were stained with a saturated solution of lead citrate and uranyl acetate and imaged with a Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscope coupled to an AMT XR-41B 2k x 2k CCD camera. Low-shear modeled microgravity conditions To model the LSMMG environment, bacterial cultures were inoculated to a final concentration of 1 × 105 cells per mL of SWT and then loaded into 50-mL capacity HARVs (Synthecon, Houston, TX), as previously described21,27. HARVs were incubated at 23 °C and rotated at 13 rpm to mimic spaceflight temperatures and to prevent sedimentation of the cultures. Gravity controls were rotated around a vertical axis to control for HARV-specific effects. To assess growth, the OD600 of the HARV cultures were measured in triplicate every 2 h using a Synergy plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). To examine the effects of LSMMG on V. fischeri size, cultures from each HARV were collected at 12 h. Cells were stained with 1% crystal violet and analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope, using PROGRES GRYPHAX Image Capture software for measurements of cell length (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To monitor motility of the LSMMG- and gravity-treated cells, aliquots were also examined with both direct light microscopy video imaging using PROGRES GRYPHAX Image Capture software and soft-agar motility assays as previously described85. All experiments were performed at least three times and outliers identified via the 1.5× interquartile range (IQR) method were removed prior to analysis87. A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess data normality. Significance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test using a cut off of p < 0.05. LPS preparation, treatments, and quantification For the quantification of V. fischeri-derived LPS, cells were spun down by centrifugation and the resulting supernatant was sterilized by successive passage through 0.45- and 0.22-μm syringe filters. Reactionogenic LPS within the cell-free filtrates was then examined using the ToxinSensorTM Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Endotoxin Assay Kit (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For all samples, the absorbance at 545 nm was used to calculate the concentration of reactionogenic LPS in endotoxin units (EU) per mL, which was subsequently normalized to the OD600 of the culture to account for differences in growth between LSMMG and gravity conditions within the HARVs. For all LAL assays, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 EU per mL standards were run in triplicate. In addition, total LPS was quantified using the colorimetric Purpald assay41 with a Synergy plate reader (Biotek, Winsooki, VT). The Purpald assay is based on the sequential periodate oxidation of LPS core-specific sugar residues and the reaction of formaldehyde with Purpald Reagent (4-amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4,triazole) to produce a purple-colored end product41. For all samples, the absorbance at 550 nm was used to calculate the concentration of total LPS in μg per mL, which was normalized by OD600 to account for differences in growth. The test:control ratio comparing total LPS from cultures grown in LSMMG versus normal gravity conditions was then calculated. For all Purpald assays, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 μg per mL LPS standards were run in triplicate. Outliers identified via the 1.5× interquartile range (IQR) method were removed prior to analysis and a Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess data normality. Significance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test using a cut off of p < 0.05. Isolation and quantification of OMVs from V. fischeri ES114 To isolate OMVs, 1 L of V. fischeri cultures were grown under LSMMG and gravity conditions in the HARVs. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant passed through 0.45 and 0.22-μm filters (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) to yield a purified, cell-free, filtrate. On those OMV samples exposed to host animals, the vesicles were pelleted by ultra-centrifugation (TL-100, Beckman, Brea, CA) at 173,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C to concentration the OMV particles. The pellet was then washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.20 M NaCl to yield a crude OMV extract. The OMVs in this extract were further separated from cellular debris by additional ultra-centrifugation at 90,000 × g for 15 h at 4 °C through a discontinuous 25–55% w/v sucrose density gradient. After, the fraction upward of 45% was collected and washed twice with PBS by ultra-centrifugation at 173,000 × g for 4 h at 4 ˚C. The final OMV preparation was filter-sterilized through a 0.22-μm filter. OMV yield was measured by protein assay using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All final OMV preparations were stored at −80 °C until use. The concentration and size distributions of OMVs produced under LSMMG and gravity conditions were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis using a NanoSight NS300 instrument equipped with a 488 nm laser (NanoSight, Ltd., Salisbury, UK). Cell-free filtrates from wild-type and motility mutants at 12, 14, and 16 h were diluted in PBS to achieve a threshold of 10–100 particles per frame. Prior to analysis, background values were subtracted from all measurements of concentration. All measurements were taken at ambient temperature (22–24 °C), with the settings for minimum expected particle size, shortest track length, and blur left at the factory default. For each sample, a minimum of 40-s capture videos was collected in triplicate, with the camera operating at the standard 30 frames-per-second. Between samples, the NS300 system was flushed thrice with PBS and once with deionized water. Further analyses to determine mean particle size, size distribution, and concentration were performed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis software suite (NTA; version 3.2, NanoSight, Ltd., Salisbury, UK). Background particle concentration was assessed by diluting and analyzing sterile SWT. A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the nanoparticle concentration data. The normality of the OMV size data—which contained over 10,000 measurements per condition—was determined with a Lillifors test88. Significance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test using a cut off of p < 0.05. General E. scolopes procedures and visualization of host apoptotic cells Squid experiments were conducted in triplicate and in accordance with the University of Florida and Kennedy Space Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. After hatching, juvenile squid was rinsed twice in 0.22 μm filtered seawater (FSW) and treated with either exogenous LPS from Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or OMVs isolated from batch cultures of the wild-type V. fischeri. A subset of hatchlings was also rendered symbiotic by inoculation with the wild-type V. fischeri to a final concentration of 1 × 105 cells per mL of FSW. After 16 h, the animals were anesthetized in a 1:1 solution of FSW and 0.37 MgCl2 for 5 min, containing 0.001% acridine orange dye. Light organ apoptosis was then examined via epifluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Colonization was verified for all treatments by measuring bacterial luminescence with a photometer (GloMax 20/20 Luminometer, Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Membrane integrity evaluation under gravity and LSMMG conditions To examine the effects of LSMMG on V. fischeri cell wall integrity, growth curves were conducted in triplicate in the presence of polymyxin B and SDS. Samples were collected from each HARV, normalized, and exposed to a solution containing either 1–10 μg polymyxin B or 0.1–1.0% SDS per mL of SWT at 23 °C without shaking. After 24 h of exposure, the samples were resuspended by pipetting and optical density was measured spectrophotometrically (OD600) and significance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test for all readings of optical density. To measure the viability of cells treated with the polymyxin B or SDS a subset of cells was then diluted and plated on SWT media. Significance between treatments of plate counts was assessed using a Welch’s t-test with a cut off of p > 0.05. To further assess the integrity of the symbiont cell membrane under LSMMG conditions, cultures were grown for 12 h at 23 °C and pelleted in 5 mL aliquots. The pellets were washed and resuspended in PBS and then incubated in 0.05% v/v Triton X-100, a non-ionic detergent that disrupts membrane lipids48 at 23 °C for 1 min. Immediately after, the absorbance was read at 405 nm and the percentage of intact, undisrupted, cells was calculated as the turbidity of the treatment group relative to the control. This value was then subtracted from 100% to obtain the percent lysis. The formula is as follows: Bacteriolysis (%) = (100% − ((OD405 of treatment/OD405 of control) × 100)). A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess data normality whereas significance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test.

    "results": "Results Shedding of V. fischeri-derived LPS increased during exponential growth under LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls To determine the potential impact of modeled microgravity on LPS release during growth, cultures of wild-type V. fischeri ES114 were grown in HARV reactors in the LSMMG and gravity positions (Fig. 1d) and monitored at 2–4-h intervals. The growth curves were characteristic of several microbes cultivated under LSMMG, including V. fischeri, exhibiting increased growth rate during exponential phase compared to gravity controls (Supplementary Fig. 1)23,27,40. At each growth interval, the V. fischeri cells were removed from the culture media and the level of exogenous LPS shed by the bacteria was measured and compared using two independent assays. First, the colorimetric ToxinSensor Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) endotoxin assay, which measures the biological reactivity of the lipid A moiety of LPS, was used to measure reactogenic LPS in the cell-free medium filtrate. The second method, the Purpald assay, is based on the periodate oxidation of sugars of the core regions of the LPS molecule41, and was used on the same, cell-free media filtrate to quantify the total amount of LPS. Although complementary, these two assays target different components of the LPS molecule42. During exponential growth in the HARV reactors, V. fischeri cells released significantly more LPS under LSMMG conditions than gravity controls even after being normalized by optical density, an indicator of cell mass (Fig. 2a). Levels of reactogenic LPS in the surrounding media, as determined by the LAL endotoxin assay, showed a pronounced increase beginning 10 h post inoculation (Fig. 2a). The significantly higher levels of LPS released from the LSMMG-grown cells continued until ~18–20 h, after which no differences in LPS levels were observed between the two growth conditions. Measurement of total LPS by the Purpald assay showed a similar increase, with the concentrations of total LPS shedding in LSMMG cultivars compared to gravity controls higher at all tested time points between 8 and 24 h post inoculation (Fig. 2b).

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p < 0.05; Mann–Whitney U test). Increased LPS release during modeled microgravity is correlated, but not completely dependent on, cell motility Previous work has shown that most of the LPS released by V. fischeri is embedded in OMVs that are derived from rotation of the outer-membrane-sheathed, polar flagella35,36,43. This result led us to determine whether LSMMG stimulates bacterial motility, which would ostensibly increase vesiculation and, as a corollary, the shedding of LPS. Interestingly, the motility of wild-type cells grown under either LSMMG or gravity conditions showed no statistical differences when examined using direct microscopic video analysis or soft-agar motility assays (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, we also compared the amount of LPS shedding by two motility-deficient V. fischeri mutants, motB1 and flhA, grown under gravity and LSMMG conditions. Mutants defective in motB1, which encodes for a flagellar motor protein, do form flagella but are unable to rotate them, whereas flhA mutants are defective in the synthesis of flagella44,45. The motility mutants shed significantly less LPS than the wild-type V. fischeri ES114 under both LSMMG and gravity conditions when normalized by optical density (Fig. 3). In wild-type cells, concentrations of reactionogenic LPS ranged between 5 × 104 and 2.5 × 105 EU per mL of media (Fig. 2a). In the motility mutants, however, the levels of reactogenic LPS were ~10-fold lower at each time point tested compared to the parent strain (Fig. 3a). By 14 h, however, there was a significant difference between the level of LPS measured in the LSMMG and gravity conditions in the motility mutants. Like the wild type, LSMMG-treated mutant cells exhibited significantly higher levels of LPS in both motility mutants compared to gravity controls (Fig. 3a). In addition, the motB1 mutants shed significantly higher levels of LPS in the LSMMG conditions compared to the flhA mutant at 14, 16, and 20 h post inoculation (Fig. 3a). These differences were also independently confirmed with the Purpald assay (Fig. 3b) and suggest potential differences between the relative abundances between the components of the LPS molecule that are shed under LSMMG conditions.

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p < 0.05; Mann–Whitney U test).The motility mutants displayed more modest growth increases compared to the parent strain, ES114 (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c) and to determine whether there were differences in cell size between the strains, cells collected from 12-h HARV cultures of wild type, motB1, and flhA mutants were stained with 1% crystal violet compare cell size under LSMMG and gravity treatments and observed with microscopy. Analyses of cell size revealed no significant difference between conditions or strains, suggesting optical density readings were directly comparable between LSMMG and gravity treatments for all strains (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Higher levels of LPS in LSMMG correlate with increased OMV production To more fully understand the mechanics of increased LPS release under LSMMG conditions, the production of OMVs was examined under modeled microgravity. Almost all of the LPS released from V. fischeri cells has been shown to be associated with OMVs, which are produced largely due to flagellar rotation35,36. Therefore, we also examined whether OMV number and size were altered under the modeled microgravity conditions. Cultures of the wild type, motB1, and flhA strains were grown in LSMMG or gravity conditions and cell-free filtrates were evaluated at 12, 14, and 16 h post inoculation using nanoparticle tracking analysis. These times were chosen as they represent growth points with the largest discrepancies in LPS content between treatments observed across all three strains. Nanoparticle analysis revealed a positive association between symbiont OMV vesiculation and modeled microgravity conditions. Specifically, the LSMMG filtrates of wild type, flhA, and motB1 were found to contain significantly more OMV particles per mL than the gravity controls (Fig. 4a). Under both conditions, OMV concentration was observed to increase over time, with both motB1 and flhA generating diminished vesicular yields relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 4a). In addition, by 14 h OMVs derived from LSMMG cultures were found to be significantly larger than gravity controls (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Dataset 1). At 16 h, the average size of OMVs for the modeled microgravity cultures was 40.72 ± 0.092 nm, whereas nanoparticle size averaged only 37.10 ± 0.092 nm for gravity controls (Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, in the motB1 and flhA motility mutants the means of OMVs from LSMMG-treated cultures were 45.35 ± 0.068 and 43.05 ± 0.065 nm, respectively, whereas the mean size of gravity-treated OMVs was 40.72 ± 0.052 (motB1) and 38.16 ± 0.056 nm (flhA). Differences were also observed in the abundance of certain sized particles. Gravity samples tended to contain a higher proportion of smaller OMVs (diameter < 40 nm), whereas those cultivated in LSMMG exhibited a more even distribution (Supplementary Fig. 3). All isolated OMVs, whether they were derived from gravity or LSMMG conditions, exhibited a comparable ability to induce apoptosis and matched previously published levels of LPS and OMV-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig. 4)21,35.

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p < 0.05; Mann–Whitney U test). V. fischeri become increasingly sensitive to cell membrane-affecting agents in LSMMG Although motility-dependent vesiculation is characteristic of species with sheathed flagella, such as V. fischeri36, all Gram-negative bacteria invariably produce OMVs by outer-membrane blebbing. OMV-blebbing is modulated by both external envelope stress and structural deficiencies in the bacterial cell wall46. Accordingly, the discovery that flagellar function does not, in fact, fully explain the model microgravity-associated differences observed in LPS-shedding or OMV release led us to hypothesize that LSMMG conditions may impact the integrity of the Gram-negative outer membrane. To investigate this, the susceptibility of V. fischeri toward a variety of cell membrane-affecting agents was compared in cells grown under LSMMG and gravity conditions, for the wild-type and motility mutants at 12, 14, and 16 h. Three specific agents were used to disrupt different components of the Gram-negative cell envelope. First, the cationic antibiotic polymyxin B was used, which binds to Gram-negative LPS and weakens the packing of lipid A molecules in the outer membrane47. Second, cells were exposed to the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which disrupts ionic interactions and causes bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis at high concentrations48. Last, cells were also exposed to a dilute solution of Triton X-100 for 1 min, which is a non-ionic detergent that disrupts lipid–lipid interactions49. After exposure, cell growth was assessed with optical density (Fig. 5; Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6) and plated to assess cell viability (Fig. 6). Fig. 5.

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p < 0.05; Welch’s t-test).Dose–response curves with 1–10 μg per mL polymyxin B and 0.1–1.0% v/v SDS revealed a concentration-dependent effect on bacterial growth in both LSMMG and gravity conditions. This effect was more pronounced in the LSMMG-treated strains at all time points tested (Fig. 5, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6); LSMMG-treated V. fischeri generally showed increased sensitivity to membrane-disrupting agents. Despite showing different baseline sensitivities, the mutant strains also appeared more susceptible to the polymyxin B and SDS agents under LSMMG conditions compared to wild-type cells at all time points tested, with the polymyxin B treatment producing the most damaging effects to the motility mutants (Fig. 5, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). Plating of cells treated with polymyxin B- and SDS-treated cells revealed comparable results (Fig. 6) indicating that, regardless of strain, the viability of those cells exposed to polymyxin B were more negatively impacted when grown under LSMMG conditions. Similar results were also observed when cells were treated with Triton X-100. Cells of LSMMG-cultivated V. fischeri, regardless of strain, were also found to be more susceptible to the bactericidal effects of 0.05% Triton X-100, exhibiting more lysis than the gravity controls after 1 min of exposure (Fig. 7). To confirm that the results observed during these HARV experiments were not the product of changes to the background pH of the SWT media under LSMMG or gravity conditions, the pH was regularly monitored, and no significant changes to the pH were observed (Supplementary Fig. 7).

    "discussion": "Discussion Over the coming decade, human-led exploration of space will likely move beyond low Earth orbit into deeper space50. Maintaining astronaut fitness during these long-duration space operations will require a detailed understanding of the microbiome under non-terrestrial conditions. To address this emerging issue in space biology, we used the HARV platform to model the effects of microgravity on V. fischeri, a beneficial microbe known to form symbiotic associations along animal epithelia. Results from this study indicated that (i) LSMMG conditions increased the shedding of bacterial LPS and associated OMVs into the surrounding media; (ii) the size of the OMV particles released during LSMMG were larger than gravity controls; (iii) flagellar motility in V. fischeri accounted for most of the overall OMV production, but was not necessary for increases in LPS shedding under LSMMG conditions; and (iv) the cell membranes of V. fischeri cells were more susceptible to disruption when cultivated under model microgravity conditions. In Gram-negative bacteria, LPS is localized to the outer membrane and consists of a hydrophobic lipid A moiety, a core polysaccharide, and an O-antigen, or outward-projecting sugar chain of variable length51,52. LPS represents one of several MAMPs used by bacteria to either evade or communicate with their eukaryotic counterparts53. There has been an intense effort in recent years to understand how LPS is recognized by the host immune system through pattern recognition receptors54, and how this immune response is altered under microgravity conditions55,56. The finding that symbiotic V. fischeri sheds more LPS under LSMMG conditions closely parallels previous studies that reported that microgravity analogs increases endotoxin load derived from the intestinal microbiota in rodents55,56. For example, in previous studies using the hindlimb unloading rodent model, a well-established method to simulate musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight57,58, results indicated that both LPS and the associated host-derived lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were elevated in rodent serum under hindlimb unloading56. Levels of circulating LPS were further increased with concurrent exposure to proton or gamma radiation, another environmental hazard of spaceflight55. Although the increased levels in the serum were thought to be the result of breakdown of the gut epithelial barrier during hindlimb unloading, the root cause of the overall increased levels of LPS shedding by the microbiota into the host serum was not assessed55,56. Interestingly, the results observed in V. fischeri differ from other host-associated taxa, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium17. In previous studies, HARV-cultivated Salmonella exhibited significantly diminished levels of LPS O-antigen in LSMMG lysates, accompanied by a down-regulation of the rfbP, rfbM, and rfbI genes involved in O-antigen biosynthesis and ligation17. However, V. fischeri lacks homologs to these O-antigen synthesis genes59. In V. fischeri the O-antigen is comprised of a single pentasaccharide comprised of a two yersiniose, one 8-epi-legionaminic acid, and two n-acetyl-L-fucosamine residues60. The two quantitative techniques used in this study, LAL and Purpald assays do not directly measure the O-antigen so the differences between the two studies could reflect the methods used to quantify the LPS molecule as well as the different architectures of the LPS molecules. Alternatively, the differences in LPS release between the taxa under LSMMG conditions may simply reflect the fact that Salmonella does not have sheathed flagella, whereas V. fischeri has a membranous sheath that requires more torque to rotate, thereby releasing more LPS61,62. In this study, the increased shedding of LPS from the bacterium V. fischeri under LSMMG conditions coincided with the exponential growth of the cultures (Fig. 2). In many taxa, including V. fischeri, higher cell densities and growth rates are observed under modeled microgravity conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1a, e)63,64. It has been proposed that the quiescent environment of LSMMG and continuous reorientation of the cell are altering the extracellular mass transfer of nutrients and waste, thereby impacting the cell’s growth rate37,65. Although V. fischeri is motile and there could be some mixing and disruption to the low-shear environment, V. fischeri may be accustomed to microgravity-like conditions as the symbionts regularly encounter low-shear environments when interfacing with the epithelial brush border of the host squid light organ tissues. Therefore, the observed increased growth rate may simply reflect the natural growth response for these symbiotic bacteria under low-shear stress environments. The increase in LPS shedding under modeled microgravity conditions was also correlated to increases in the production of OMVs. The release of OMVs is an important mechanism by which bacteria interact with their environment66. OMVs derived from Gram-negative bacteria are produced in all stages of growth, and are frequently enriched with a range of bioreactive molecules, including LPS, outer-membrane proteins, and peptidoglycan-derivatives46,67,68. These discrete, enclosed structures are known mediators of host–microbe communication in both pathogenic and mutualistic associations69. In the squid-vibrio symbiosis, V. fischeri OMVs have previously been shown to induce hemocyte trafficking and apoptosis in the host symbiotic light organ, and are important mediators of bacteria-induced development in the host animal43,68. Both exogenous LPS and symbiont-derived OMVs can induce significant apoptosis in the light organ of uncolonized, aposymbiotic hatchlings, even at low concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, even small fluctuations in the amount of OMVs released in LSMMG could feasibly shift the timeline of symbiotic development. The observed increase in the release of LPS containing OMVs during LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls may suggest that the cells experience increased physiological stress in the modeled microgravity conditions, in particular, during exponential growth. Environmental stresses, such as temperature and osmotic stresses, can increase vesiculation in numerous Gram-negative bacteria70. The hypervesiculation of OMVs has been shown to relieve the cell envelope from waste products and the build-up of damaged, or misfolded, proteins, which accumulate during stress and normal growth70,71. Interestingly, the increased in OMV production under modeled microgravity conditions may also provide a possible mechanism for the increase resistance to environmental stresses and antibiotics observed in some microbes grown under both natural and microgravity conditions37,72,73. The ability of OMVs to quickly remove toxic material as well as absorb and bind antimicrobial agents may also serve as an important survival mechanism for microbes under stressful conditions, such as spaceflight. One of the major mechanisms by which V. fischeri releases the OMVs is through flagellar rotation36. Certain members of the genus Vibrio, along with several other microbiome-associated taxa, such as Helicobacter, Brucella, and Campylobacter, produce flagella covered with a membrane-derived sheath74–79. These sheathed flagella have long been postulated to be a mechanism of communication between microbes and host tissues43,69,80. During rotation of the flagella, OMVs can then be released from both the tip and shaft of the flagella81,82. Mutants defective in flagella production, or in the rotation of the flagella, shed significantly fewer OMVs in comparison to wild-type strains36. This result is consistent with the V. fischeri strains grown in the HARV reactors, suggesting flagellar rotation is likely the primary, but not the only, mechanism by which OMVs are being released in both LSMMG and gravity conditions (Fig. 4). Interestingly, previous work found that flagella-driven increases in OMV release corresponded to smaller OMV size, whereas our results found that LSMMG-associated increases in OMV release corresponded with larger OMV sizes36. This result suggests that LSMMG presents a novel stress that stimulates a unique nonmotility- associated mechanism for OMV production changes in V. fischeri. In this vein, LSMMG stimulates increased production of OMVs across a range of bacteria with distinct lifestyles. Hypervesiculation has been reported in gentamycin-challenged spaceflight cultures of E. coli, a bacterium with unsheathed flagella, which unlike sheathed flagella, do not mediate LPS release40. Our findings indicate the increased release of OMVs under modeled microgravity conditions may reflect changes in membrane integrity. Bacteria have previously been found to have altered cells membranes in both spaceflight and modeled microgravity conditions. For example, irregularities in cell volume, envelope integrity, and membrane polarization have been reported for E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus cultured in both natural and modeled microgravity conditions63,83. The increased susceptibility of V. fischeri strains to membrane-disruption agents (Figs. 5–7; Supplementary Figs. 5–6) further support the hypothesis that the cell membrane of V. fischeri is weakened by exposure to modeled microgravity conditions. In addition, previous analysis of the transcriptome of V. fischeri cells showed no differential expression of genes associated with LPS production during either exponential or stationary phase when grown under LSMMG27. Therefore, the results suggest that increases in the amount of LPS shed by V. fischeri occur primarily through mechanical means, and not through changes in LPS biosynthesis. Additional research is needed, however, to explore whether increased OMV shedding in LSMMG causes, or is caused by, LSMMG-related changes in cell membrane integrity. Together, these results show that symbiotic microbes display significant physiological changes under modeled microgravity conditions, leading to a change in release of MAMPs known to affect host biology, which may have implications on host–microbe interactions. For example, in symbiotic bobtail squid exposed to modeled microgravity conditions the onset and peak of V. fischeri-induced apoptosis of the light organ’s superficial epithelium occurs significantly earlier than under gravity controls, which could be explained by increased OMV shedding21. Interestingly though, under LSMMG conditions there is also a delay in the trafficking of host immune cells within the superficial epithelium21, which is also typically triggered by MAMPs and is dependent on the presence of the outer-membrane protein OmpU in the OMVs43,68. This dissociated response in the host animal under LSMMG suggests microgravity may alter the content of the OMVs, or that the host may be responding differently to these bacterial-derived signals under microgravity, despite the lack of differences observed in the extent of LPS-induced cell death between LSMMG and gravity controls (Supplementary Fig. 4). As many of the mechanisms that V. fischeri use to communicate with its host are shared amongst both pathogenic and beneficial microbes alike, our work provides important insight into how microgravity-like conditions may alter host–microbe relationships at the physiological level in general. Maintaining homeostasis of the microbiome during spaceflight is critical for the long-term host health, and these findings help build a critical framework to begin to explore the specific interactions and responses that occur between animals and their associated microbes.",

Copyright notice ID: 7940393 PMID: 33686090 Abstract Reduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology of animals, but the effects on their associated microbiomes are not well understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from V. fischeri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility. Mutants of V. fischeri defective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer-membrane integrity of V. fischeri, as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell-membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceflight. Subject terms: Microbiology, ZoologyIntroduction All animals form beneficial associations with microbes, and these symbioses, collectively called the microbiome, constitute a powerful determinant of development, health, and fitness1,2. Indeed, alterations in the composition of the microbiome, its secretion of bioactive metabolites, as well as the symbionts’ resultant with host systems (e.g., nervous, immune, endocrine) have been found to correlate with a variety of illnesses and disorders2–4. Understanding how mutualistic microbes adapt to stressful conditions within animal hosts, including humans, therefore, represents a crucial topic for microbiome research. One environment that presents numerous challenges to host–microbe homeostasis is spaceflight5. In particular, the microgravity conditions (10−6 × g) that astronauts experience during spaceflight have been shown to disrupt the normal physiology of the human body, including the intestinal microbiome6,7. This dysbiotic response is characterized by a decline in gut bacteria predicted to be protective, including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp.; the increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens like Escherichia coli, Enterobacteria spp., and Clostridia spp.; as well as shifts in the relative proportions of dominant taxa from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes6–12. In addition to measuring the relative abundance of various bacterial populations, many studies have also sought to determine the impact of the spaceflight on the physiology of those taxa. In this regard, microgravity and microgravity-analog conditions have been found to increase the resistance of opportunistic pathogens, such as E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to acid, heat, osmotic, and oxidative stresses13–15. Cultivation in these conditions is also known to promote biofilm formation and enhance the virulence of certain pathogens, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium16–19 and Serratia marcescens20. Though much progress has been made in delineating how pathogenic microbes respond to this unique stressor, the larger discussion of how beneficial microbes respond to microgravity has only recently begun to be examined21–27. One mutualistic association that has emerged as a tractable model by which to examine beneficial host–microbe interactions under modeled and natural microgravity conditions is the monospecific symbiosis between the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and its bioluminescent partner Vibrio fischeri21,24,28. Upon hatching, V. fischeri colonizes a specialized organ, known as the light organ, within the host animal and induces an irreversible remodeling of the symbiotic tissues29. The remodeling is marked by a pronounced apoptotic cell death event throughout the light organ’s superficial, ciliated epithelium30,31, a structure that is used to recruit symbiosis-competent V. fischeri from the environment and facilitate the onset of the association. Two microbe-associated molecular pattern signals (MAMPs) that have been identified as the primary mediators of the V. fischeri-induced apoptotic event in E. scolopes are LPS and the peptidoglycan-derived monomer, tracheal cytotoxin (TCT)32,33. These two MAMPs work synergistically to induce apoptosis and regression of the light organ’s ciliated epithelium during the onset of symbiosis33,34. Early-stage apoptosis within the host tissues, however, is primarily attributed to LPS32, and most of the LPS released by V. fischeri is embedded in outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) that are shed via rotation of the bacterium’s sheathed, polar, flagella (Fig. 1a–c)35,36. The rapid onset of MAMP-inducible phenotypes, combined with the binary nature of the light organ symbiosis, has rendered the squid-vibrio system a uniquely informative model for the study of animal-microbial mutualisms in microgravity22.

HARVs mimic the quiescent, low-shear, fluid conditions of spaceflight when rotated around a horizontal axis (Fig. 1d)22,37. Alternatively, rotation around a vertical axis is used to control for system-specific effects under normal Earth gravity conditions22,38. This low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment has been used to successfully mimic microgravity for decades, and has been correlated to results obtained during actual spaceflight13,23,37. Previous work with the squid-vibrio symbiosis using LSMMG has found that the normal symbiont-induced development of the light organ is altered by LSMMG21,23,24,27. Specifically, modeled microgravity accelerates both the onset and peak of apoptosis in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic, LPS-treated hatchlings21. Given the role of LPS in the normal bacteria-induced development of E. scolopes, these findings raised the possibility that LSMMG may alter MAMP-mediated channels of host–microbe communication. MAMPs are a crucial component of both beneficial and pathogenic interactions39; therefore, in this study, we examined the impact of LSMMG on the release of LPS and OMVs by V. fischeri, and assessed the overall physiology of the symbiont when cultivated under microgravity-like conditions. Examining the effects of modeled microgravity on beneficial microbes has the potential to both provide new insight on the underlying mechanisms of microgravity-induced dysbiosis and further our understanding of mutualistic host-microbe interactions during spaceflight.Results Shedding of V. fischeri-derived LPS increased during exponential growth under LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls To determine the potential impact of modeled microgravity on LPS release during growth, cultures of wild-type V. fischeri ES114 were grown in HARV reactors in the LSMMG and gravity positions (Fig. 1d) and monitored at 2–4-h intervals. The growth curves were characteristic of several microbes cultivated under LSMMG, including V. fischeri, exhibiting increased growth rate during exponential phase compared to gravity controls (Supplementary Fig. 1)23,27,40. At each growth interval, the V. fischeri cells were removed from the culture media and the level of exogenous LPS shed by the bacteria was measured and compared using two independent assays. First, the colorimetric ToxinSensor Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) endotoxin assay, which measures the biological reactivity of the lipid A moiety of LPS, was used to measure reactogenic LPS in the cell-free medium filtrate. The second method, the Purpald assay, is based on the periodate oxidation of sugars of the core regions of the LPS molecule41, and was used on the same, cell-free media filtrate to quantify the total amount of LPS. Although complementary, these two assays target different components of the LPS molecule42. During exponential growth in the HARV reactors, V. fischeri cells released significantly more LPS under LSMMG conditions than gravity controls even after being normalized by optical density, an indicator of cell mass (Fig. 2a). Levels of reactogenic LPS in the surrounding media, as determined by the LAL endotoxin assay, showed a pronounced increase beginning 10 h post inoculation (Fig. 2a). The significantly higher levels of LPS released from the LSMMG-grown cells continued until ~18–20 h, after which no differences in LPS levels were observed between the two growth conditions. Measurement of total LPS by the Purpald assay showed a similar increase, with the concentrations of total LPS shedding in LSMMG cultivars compared to gravity controls higher at all tested time points between 8 and 24 h post inoculation (Fig. 2b).

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p < 0.05; Mann–Whitney U test).Increased LPS release during modeled microgravity is correlated, but not completely dependent on, cell motility Previous work has shown that most of the LPS released by V. fischeri is embedded in OMVs that are derived from rotation of the outer-membrane-sheathed, polar flagella35,36,43. This result led us to determine whether LSMMG stimulates bacterial motility, which would ostensibly increase vesiculation and, as a corollary, the shedding of LPS. Interestingly, the motility of wild-type cells grown under either LSMMG or gravity conditions showed no statistical differences when examined using direct microscopic video analysis or soft-agar motility assays (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, we also compared the amount of LPS shedding by two motility-deficient V. fischeri mutants, motB1 and flhA, grown under gravity and LSMMG conditions. Mutants defective in motB1, which encodes for a flagellar motor protein, do form flagella but are unable to rotate them, whereas flhA mutants are defective in the synthesis of flagella44,45. The motility mutants shed significantly less LPS than the wild-type V. fischeri ES114 under both LSMMG and gravity conditions when normalized by optical density (Fig. 3). In wild-type cells, concentrations of reactionogenic LPS ranged between 5 × 104 and 2.5 × 105 EU per mL of media (Fig. 2a). In the motility mutants, however, the levels of reactogenic LPS were ~10-fold lower at each time point tested compared to the parent strain (Fig. 3a). By 14 h, however, there was a significant difference between the level of LPS measured in the LSMMG and gravity conditions in the motility mutants. Like the wild type, LSMMG-treated mutant cells exhibited significantly higher levels of LPS in both motility mutants compared to gravity controls (Fig. 3a). In addition, the motB1 mutants shed significantly higher levels of LPS in the LSMMG conditions compared to the flhA mutant at 14, 16, and 20 h post inoculation (Fig. 3a). These differences were also independently confirmed with the Purpald assay (Fig. 3b) and suggest potential differences between the relative abundances between the components of the LPS molecule that are shed under LSMMG conditions.

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p < 0.05; Mann–Whitney U test).The motility mutants displayed more modest growth increases compared to the parent strain, ES114 (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c) and to determine whether there were differences in cell size between the strains, cells collected from 12-h HARV cultures of wild type, motB1, and flhA mutants were stained with 1% crystal violet compare cell size under LSMMG and gravity treatments and observed with microscopy. Analyses of cell size revealed no significant difference between conditions or strains, suggesting optical density readings were directly comparable between LSMMG and gravity treatments for all strains (Supplementary Fig. 1d).Higher levels of LPS in LSMMG correlate with increased OMV production To more fully understand the mechanics of increased LPS release under LSMMG conditions, the production of OMVs was examined under modeled microgravity. Almost all of the LPS released from V. fischeri cells has been shown to be associated with OMVs, which are produced largely due to flagellar rotation35,36. Therefore, we also examined whether OMV number and size were altered under the modeled microgravity conditions. Cultures of the wild type, motB1, and flhA strains were grown in LSMMG or gravity conditions and cell-free filtrates were evaluated at 12, 14, and 16 h post inoculation using nanoparticle tracking analysis. These times were chosen as they represent growth points with the largest discrepancies in LPS content between treatments observed across all three strains. Nanoparticle analysis revealed a positive association between symbiont OMV vesiculation and modeled microgravity conditions. Specifically, the LSMMG filtrates of wild type, flhA, and motB1 were found to contain significantly more OMV particles per mL than the gravity controls (Fig. 4a). Under both conditions, OMV concentration was observed to increase over time, with both motB1 and flhA generating diminished vesicular yields relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 4a). In addition, by 14 h OMVs derived from LSMMG cultures were found to be significantly larger than gravity controls (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Dataset 1). At 16 h, the average size of OMVs for the modeled microgravity cultures was 40.72 ± 0.092 nm, whereas nanoparticle size averaged only 37.10 ± 0.092 nm for gravity controls (Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, in the motB1 and flhA motility mutants the means of OMVs from LSMMG-treated cultures were 45.35 ± 0.068 and 43.05 ± 0.065 nm, respectively, whereas the mean size of gravity-treated OMVs was 40.72 ± 0.052 (motB1) and 38.16 ± 0.056 nm (flhA). Differences were also observed in the abundance of certain sized particles. Gravity samples tended to contain a higher proportion of smaller OMVs (diameter < 40 nm), whereas those cultivated in LSMMG exhibited a more even distribution (Supplementary Fig. 3). All isolated OMVs, whether they were derived from gravity or LSMMG conditions, exhibited a comparable ability to induce apoptosis and matched previously published levels of LPS and OMV-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig. 4)21,35.

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p < 0.05; Mann–Whitney U test). V. fischeri become increasingly sensitive to cell membrane-affecting agents in LSMMG Although motility-dependent vesiculation is characteristic of species with sheathed flagella, such as V. fischeri36, all Gram-negative bacteria invariably produce OMVs by outer-membrane blebbing. OMV-blebbing is modulated by both external envelope stress and structural deficiencies in the bacterial cell wall46. Accordingly, the discovery that flagellar function does not, in fact, fully explain the model microgravity-associated differences observed in LPS-shedding or OMV release led us to hypothesize that LSMMG conditions may impact the integrity of the Gram-negative outer membrane. To investigate this, the susceptibility of V. fischeri toward a variety of cell membrane-affecting agents was compared in cells grown under LSMMG and gravity conditions, for the wild-type and motility mutants at 12, 14, and 16 h. Three specific agents were used to disrupt different components of the Gram-negative cell envelope. First, the cationic antibiotic polymyxin B was used, which binds to Gram-negative LPS and weakens the packing of lipid A molecules in the outer membrane47. Second, cells were exposed to the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which disrupts ionic interactions and causes bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis at high concentrations48. Last, cells were also exposed to a dilute solution of Triton X-100 for 1 min, which is a non-ionic detergent that disrupts lipid–lipid interactions49. After exposure, cell growth was assessed with optical density (Fig. 5; Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6) and plated to assess cell viability (Fig. 6). Fig. 5. Dose–response of Vibrio fischeri cell densities in the presence of polymyxin B and sodium dodecyl sulfate.

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p < 0.05; Welch’s t-test).Dose–response curves with 1–10 μg per mL polymyxin B and 0.1–1.0% v/v SDS revealed a concentration-dependent effect on bacterial growth in both LSMMG and gravity conditions. This effect was more pronounced in the LSMMG-treated strains at all time points tested (Fig. 5, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6); LSMMG-treated V. fischeri generally showed increased sensitivity to membrane-disrupting agents. Despite showing different baseline sensitivities, the mutant strains also appeared more susceptible to the polymyxin B and SDS agents under LSMMG conditions compared to wild-type cells at all time points tested, with the polymyxin B treatment producing the most damaging effects to the motility mutants (Fig. 5, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). Plating of cells treated with polymyxin B- and SDS-treated cells revealed comparable results (Fig. 6) indicating that, regardless of strain, the viability of those cells exposed to polymyxin B were more negatively impacted when grown under LSMMG conditions. Similar results were also observed when cells were treated with Triton X-100. Cells of LSMMG-cultivated V. fischeri, regardless of strain, were also found to be more susceptible to the bactericidal effects of 0.05% Triton X-100, exhibiting more lysis than the gravity controls after 1 min of exposure (Fig. 7). To confirm that the results observed during these HARV experiments were not the product of changes to the background pH of the SWT media under LSMMG or gravity conditions, the pH was regularly monitored, and no significant changes to the pH were observed (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p < 0.05; Mann–Whitney U test).Discussion Over the coming decade, human-led exploration of space will likely move beyond low Earth orbit into deeper space50. Maintaining astronaut fitness during these long-duration space operations will require a detailed understanding of the microbiome under non-terrestrial conditions. To address this emerging issue in space biology, we used the HARV platform to model the effects of microgravity on V. fischeri, a beneficial microbe known to form symbiotic associations along animal epithelia. Results from this study indicated that (i) LSMMG conditions increased the shedding of bacterial LPS and associated OMVs into the surrounding media; (ii) the size of the OMV particles released during LSMMG were larger than gravity controls; (iii) flagellar motility in V. fischeri accounted for most of the overall OMV production, but was not necessary for increases in LPS shedding under LSMMG conditions; and (iv) the cell membranes of V. fischeri cells were more susceptible to disruption when cultivated under model microgravity conditions. In Gram-negative bacteria, LPS is localized to the outer membrane and consists of a hydrophobic lipid A moiety, a core polysaccharide, and an O-antigen, or outward-projecting sugar chain of variable length51,52. LPS represents one of several MAMPs used by bacteria to either evade or communicate with their eukaryotic counterparts53. There has been an intense effort in recent years to understand how LPS is recognized by the host immune system through pattern recognition receptors54, and how this immune response is altered under microgravity conditions55,56. The finding that symbiotic V. fischeri sheds more LPS under LSMMG conditions closely parallels previous studies that reported that microgravity analogs increases endotoxin load derived from the intestinal microbiota in rodents55,56. For example, in previous studies using the hindlimb unloading rodent model, a well-established method to simulate musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight57,58, results indicated that both LPS and the associated host-derived lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were elevated in rodent serum under hindlimb unloading56. Levels of circulating LPS were further increased with concurrent exposure to proton or gamma radiation, another environmental hazard of spaceflight55. Although the increased levels in the serum were thought to be the result of breakdown of the gut epithelial barrier during hindlimb unloading, the root cause of the overall increased levels of LPS shedding by the microbiota into the host serum was not assessed55,56. Interestingly, the results observed in V. fischeri differ from other host-associated taxa, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium17. In previous studies, HARV-cultivated Salmonella exhibited significantly diminished levels of LPS O-antigen in LSMMG lysates, accompanied by a down-regulation of the rfbP, rfbM, and rfbI genes involved in O-antigen biosynthesis and ligation17. However, V. fischeri lacks homologs to these O-antigen synthesis genes59. In V. fischeri the O-antigen is comprised of a single pentasaccharide comprised of a two yersiniose, one 8-epi-legionaminic acid, and two n-acetyl-L-fucosamine residues60. The two quantitative techniques used in this study, LAL and Purpald assays do not directly measure the O-antigen so the differences between the two studies could reflect the methods used to quantify the LPS molecule as well as the different architectures of the LPS molecules. Alternatively, the differences in LPS release between the taxa under LSMMG conditions may simply reflect the fact that Salmonella does not have sheathed flagella, whereas V. fischeri has a membranous sheath that requires more torque to rotate, thereby releasing more LPS61,62. In this study, the increased shedding of LPS from the bacterium V. fischeri under LSMMG conditions coincided with the exponential growth of the cultures (Fig. 2). In many taxa, including V. fischeri, higher cell densities and growth rates are observed under modeled microgravity conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1a, e)63,64. It has been proposed that the quiescent environment of LSMMG and continuous reorientation of the cell are altering the extracellular mass transfer of nutrients and waste, thereby impacting the cell’s growth rate37,65. Although V. fischeri is motile and there could be some mixing and disruption to the low-shear environment, V. fischeri may be accustomed to microgravity-like conditions as the symbionts regularly encounter low-shear environments when interfacing with the epithelial brush border of the host squid light organ tissues. Therefore, the observed increased growth rate may simply reflect the natural growth response for these symbiotic bacteria under low-shear stress environments. The increase in LPS shedding under modeled microgravity conditions was also correlated to increases in the production of OMVs. The release of OMVs is an important mechanism by which bacteria interact with their environment66. OMVs derived from Gram-negative bacteria are produced in all stages of growth, and are frequently enriched with a range of bioreactive molecules, including LPS, outer-membrane proteins, and peptidoglycan-derivatives46,67,68. These discrete, enclosed structures are known mediators of host–microbe communication in both pathogenic and mutualistic associations69. In the squid-vibrio symbiosis, V. fischeri OMVs have previously been shown to induce hemocyte trafficking and apoptosis in the host symbiotic light organ, and are important mediators of bacteria-induced development in the host animal43,68. Both exogenous LPS and symbiont-derived OMVs can induce significant apoptosis in the light organ of uncolonized, aposymbiotic hatchlings, even at low concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, even small fluctuations in the amount of OMVs released in LSMMG could feasibly shift the timeline of symbiotic development. The observed increase in the release of LPS containing OMVs during LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls may suggest that the cells experience increased physiological stress in the modeled microgravity conditions, in particular, during exponential growth. Environmental stresses, such as temperature and osmotic stresses, can increase vesiculation in numerous Gram-negative bacteria70. The hypervesiculation of OMVs has been shown to relieve the cell envelope from waste products and the build-up of damaged, or misfolded, proteins, which accumulate during stress and normal growth70,71. Interestingly, the increased in OMV production under modeled microgravity conditions may also provide a possible mechanism for the increase resistance to environmental stresses and antibiotics observed in some microbes grown under both natural and microgravity conditions37,72,73. The ability of OMVs to quickly remove toxic material as well as absorb and bind antimicrobial agents may also serve as an important survival mechanism for microbes under stressful conditions, such as spaceflight. One of the major mechanisms by which V. fischeri releases the OMVs is through flagellar rotation36. Certain members of the genus Vibrio, along with several other microbiome-associated taxa, such as Helicobacter, Brucella, and Campylobacter, produce flagella covered with a membrane-derived sheath74–79. These sheathed flagella have long been postulated to be a mechanism of communication between microbes and host tissues43,69,80. During rotation of the flagella, OMVs can then be released from both the tip and shaft of the flagella81,82. Mutants defective in flagella production, or in the rotation of the flagella, shed significantly fewer OMVs in comparison to wild-type strains36. This result is consistent with the V. fischeri strains grown in the HARV reactors, suggesting flagellar rotation is likely the primary, but not the only, mechanism by which OMVs are being released in both LSMMG and gravity conditions (Fig. 4). Interestingly, previous work found that flagella-driven increases in OMV release corresponded to smaller OMV size, whereas our results found that LSMMG-associated increases in OMV release corresponded with larger OMV sizes36. This result suggests that LSMMG presents a novel stress that stimulates a unique nonmotility- associated mechanism for OMV production changes in V. fischeri. In this vein, LSMMG stimulates increased production of OMVs across a range of bacteria with distinct lifestyles. Hypervesiculation has been reported in gentamycin-challenged spaceflight cultures of E. coli, a bacterium with unsheathed flagella, which unlike sheathed flagella, do not mediate LPS release40. Our findings indicate the increased release of OMVs under modeled microgravity conditions may reflect changes in membrane integrity. Bacteria have previously been found to have altered cells membranes in both spaceflight and modeled microgravity conditions. For example, irregularities in cell volume, envelope integrity, and membrane polarization have been reported for E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus cultured in both natural and modeled microgravity conditions63,83. The increased susceptibility of V. fischeri strains to membrane-disruption agents (Figs. 5–7; Supplementary Figs. 5–6) further support the hypothesis that the cell membrane of V. fischeri is weakened by exposure to modeled microgravity conditions. In addition, previous analysis of the transcriptome of V. fischeri cells showed no differential expression of genes associated with LPS production during either exponential or stationary phase when grown under LSMMG27. Therefore, the results suggest that increases in the amount of LPS shed by V. fischeri occur primarily through mechanical means, and not through changes in LPS biosynthesis. Additional research is needed, however, to explore whether increased OMV shedding in LSMMG causes, or is caused by, LSMMG-related changes in cell membrane integrity. Together, these results show that symbiotic microbes display significant physiological changes under modeled microgravity conditions, leading to a change in release of MAMPs known to affect host biology, which may have implications on host–microbe interactions. For example, in symbiotic bobtail squid exposed to modeled microgravity conditions the onset and peak of V. fischeri-induced apoptosis of the light organ’s superficial epithelium occurs significantly earlier than under gravity controls, which could be explained by increased OMV shedding21. Interestingly though, under LSMMG conditions there is also a delay in the trafficking of host immune cells within the superficial epithelium21, which is also typically triggered by MAMPs and is dependent on the presence of the outer-membrane protein OmpU in the OMVs43,68. This dissociated response in the host animal under LSMMG suggests microgravity may alter the content of the OMVs, or that the host may be responding differently to these bacterial-derived signals under microgravity, despite the lack of differences observed in the extent of LPS-induced cell death between LSMMG and gravity controls (Supplementary Fig. 4). As many of the mechanisms that V. fischeri use to communicate with its host are shared amongst both pathogenic and beneficial microbes alike, our work provides important insight into how microgravity-like conditions may alter host–microbe relationships at the physiological level in general. Maintaining homeostasis of the microbiome during spaceflight is critical for the long-term host health, and these findings help build a critical framework to begin to explore the specific interactions and responses that occur between animals and their associated microbes.Methods Bacterial strains, media, and growth conditions The strains of V. fischeri used in this study include: wild-type V. fischeri ES11484; the non-motile, flagellated, mutant motB1::Tn7ermR; and the non-flagellated mutant flhA::Tn7ermR45. For all experiments, V. fischeri was grown in seawater tryptone broth (SWT; 70% filtered ocean water containing 5 g L−1 tryptone, 3 g L−1 yeast extract, and 32.5 mM glycerol) at 28 ˚C with shaking. Where appropriate, media was supplemented with erythromycin to a final concentration of 5 μg per mL. Retention of the transposon insertions in the motB1 and flhA motility mutants was verified for all experiments via soft-agar motility assays85. For assessments of growth, the concentration of V. fischeri was determined by reading the optical density at 600 nm, as an OD600 of 1.0 has been previously shown by plate counts to correspond with 3 × 108 cells per mL of culture84,86 and was independently confirmed in the HARVs. To ensure that background levels of OMVs did not significantly alter the OD600 readings, 1 mL of V. fischeri culture was filtered to remove bacteria using a 0.22 µm syringe filter and measured spectrophotometrically. No significant (p < 0.0001) difference in optical density was observed in the spent media from background SWT media.Electron microscopy All scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and transmission electron micrographs (TEM) were acquired at the University of Hawai’i Biological Electron Microscopy Facility. For SEM, V. fischeri were grown in SWT media to mid-log phase (OD600 0.4–0.6) with shaking at 28 °C. For TEM, cells were grown under similar conditions in LB salt (LBS) media containing 10 g L−1 tryptone, 5 g L−1 yeast extract, 342 mM NaCl, and 20 mM Tris at pH 7.5. Samples visualized with SEM were fixed with marine fixative containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 350 mM sucrose, 100 mM sodium cacodylate at pH 7.6 for 1 h. The cells were then washed in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer containing 400 mM sucrose and post-fixed with 100 mM sodium cacodylate containing 1% osmium tetraoxide for 1 h. After fixation the cells were collected on a 0.22-μm filter, then serially dehydrated in ethanol and dried with a Tousimis Samdri-795 critical point dryer. Filters were mounted on aluminum stubs and sputter coated with a Hummer 6.2 sputter coater, then imaged with a Hitachi S-4800 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope with accelerating voltage. TEM was performed as previously described68. Briefly, V. fischeri cells were fixed, washed, and post-fixed similarly to the samples prepared for SEM. Fixed V. fischeri cells were then serially dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, infiltrated with propylene oxide, then embedded and polymerized in LX112 epoxy resin for 2 days. Ultrathin sections were stained with a saturated solution of lead citrate and uranyl acetate and imaged with a Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscope coupled to an AMT XR-41B 2k x 2k CCD camera.Low-shear modeled microgravity conditions To model the LSMMG environment, bacterial cultures were inoculated to a final concentration of 1 × 105 cells per mL of SWT and then loaded into 50-mL capacity HARVs (Synthecon, Houston, TX), as previously described21,27. HARVs were incubated at 23 °C and rotated at 13 rpm to mimic spaceflight temperatures and to prevent sedimentation of the cultures. Gravity controls were rotated around a vertical axis to control for HARV-specific effects. To assess growth, the OD600 of the HARV cultures were measured in triplicate every 2 h using a Synergy plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). To examine the effects of LSMMG on V. fischeri size, cultures from each HARV were collected at 12 h. Cells were stained with 1% crystal violet and analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope, using PROGRES GRYPHAX Image Capture software for measurements of cell length (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To monitor motility of the LSMMG- and gravity-treated cells, aliquots were also examined with both direct light microscopy video imaging using PROGRES GRYPHAX Image Capture software and soft-agar motility assays as previously described85. All experiments were performed at least three times and outliers identified via the 1.5× interquartile range (IQR) method were removed prior to analysis87. A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess data normality. Significance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test using a cut off of p < 0.05.LPS preparation, treatments, and quantification For the quantification of V. fischeri-derived LPS, cells were spun down by centrifugation and the resulting supernatant was sterilized by successive passage through 0.45- and 0.22-μm syringe filters. Reactionogenic LPS within the cell-free filtrates was then examined using the ToxinSensorTM Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Endotoxin Assay Kit (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For all samples, the absorbance at 545 nm was used to calculate the concentration of reactionogenic LPS in endotoxin units (EU) per mL, which was subsequently normalized to the OD600 of the culture to account for differences in growth between LSMMG and gravity conditions within the HARVs. For all LAL assays, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 EU per mL standards were run in triplicate. In addition, total LPS was quantified using the colorimetric Purpald assay41 with a Synergy plate reader (Biotek, Winsooki, VT). The Purpald assay is based on the sequential periodate oxidation of LPS core-specific sugar residues and the reaction of formaldehyde with Purpald Reagent (4-amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4,triazole) to produce a purple-colored end product41. For all samples, the absorbance at 550 nm was used to calculate the concentration of total LPS in μg per mL, which was normalized by OD600 to account for differences in growth. The test:control ratio comparing total LPS from cultures grown in LSMMG versus normal gravity conditions was then calculated. For all Purpald assays, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 μg per mL LPS standards were run in triplicate. Outliers identified via the 1.5× interquartile range (IQR) method were removed prior to analysis and a Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess data normality. Significance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test using a cut off of p < 0.05.Isolation and quantification of OMVs from V. fischeri ES114 To isolate OMVs, 1 L of V. fischeri cultures were grown under LSMMG and gravity conditions in the HARVs. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant passed through 0.45 and 0.22-μm filters (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) to yield a purified, cell-free, filtrate. On those OMV samples exposed to host animals, the vesicles were pelleted by ultra-centrifugation (TL-100, Beckman, Brea, CA) at 173,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C to concentration the OMV particles. The pellet was then washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.20 M NaCl to yield a crude OMV extract. The OMVs in this extract were further separated from cellular debris by additional ultra-centrifugation at 90,000 × g for 15 h at 4 °C through a discontinuous 25–55% w/v sucrose density gradient. After, the fraction upward of 45% was collected and washed twice with PBS by ultra-centrifugation at 173,000 × g for 4 h at 4 ˚C. The final OMV preparation was filter-sterilized through a 0.22-μm filter. OMV yield was measured by protein assay using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All final OMV preparations were stored at −80 °C until use. The concentration and size distributions of OMVs produced under LSMMG and gravity conditions were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis using a NanoSight NS300 instrument equipped with a 488 nm laser (NanoSight, Ltd., Salisbury, UK). Cell-free filtrates from wild-type and motility mutants at 12, 14, and 16 h were diluted in PBS to achieve a threshold of 10–100 particles per frame. Prior to analysis, background values were subtracted from all measurements of concentration. All measurements were taken at ambient temperature (22–24 °C), with the settings for minimum expected particle size, shortest track length, and blur left at the factory default. For each sample, a minimum of 40-s capture videos was collected in triplicate, with the camera operating at the standard 30 frames-per-second. Between samples, the NS300 system was flushed thrice with PBS and once with deionized water. Further analyses to determine mean particle size, size distribution, and concentration were performed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis software suite (NTA; version 3.2, NanoSight, Ltd., Salisbury, UK). Background particle concentration was assessed by diluting and analyzing sterile SWT. A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the nanoparticle concentration data. The normality of the OMV size data—which contained over 10,000 measurements per condition—was determined with a Lillifors test88. Significance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test using a cut off of p < 0.05.General E. scolopes procedures and visualization of host apoptotic cells Squid experiments were conducted in triplicate and in accordance with the University of Florida and Kennedy Space Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. After hatching, juvenile squid was rinsed twice in 0.22 μm filtered seawater (FSW) and treated with either exogenous LPS from Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or OMVs isolated from batch cultures of the wild-type V. fischeri. A subset of hatchlings was also rendered symbiotic by inoculation with the wild-type V. fischeri to a final concentration of 1 × 105 cells per mL of FSW. After 16 h, the animals were anesthetized in a 1:1 solution of FSW and 0.37 MgCl2 for 5 min, containing 0.001% acridine orange dye. Light organ apoptosis was then examined via epifluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Colonization was verified for all treatments by measuring bacterial luminescence with a photometer (GloMax 20/20 Luminometer, Promega Corp., Madison, WI).Membrane integrity evaluation under gravity and LSMMG conditions To examine the effects of LSMMG on V. fischeri cell wall integrity, growth curves were conducted in triplicate in the presence of polymyxin B and SDS. Samples were collected from each HARV, normalized, and exposed to a solution containing either 1–10 μg polymyxin B or 0.1–1.0% SDS per mL of SWT at 23 °C without shaking. After 24 h of exposure, the samples were resuspended by pipetting and optical density was measured spectrophotometrically (OD600) and significance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test for all readings of optical density. To measure the viability of cells treated with the polymyxin B or SDS a subset of cells was then diluted and plated on SWT media. Significance between treatments of plate counts was assessed using a Welch’s t-test with a cut off of p > 0.05. To further assess the integrity of the symbiont cell membrane under LSMMG conditions, cultures were grown for 12 h at 23 °C and pelleted in 5 mL aliquots. The pellets were washed and resuspended in PBS and then incubated in 0.05% v/v Triton X-100, a non-ionic detergent that disrupts membrane lipids48 at 23 °C for 1 min. Immediately after, the absorbance was read at 405 nm and the percentage of intact, undisrupted, cells was calculated as the turbidity of the treatment group relative to the control. This value was then subtracted from 100% to obtain the percent lysis. The formula is as follows: Bacteriolysis (%) = (100% − ((OD405 of treatment/OD405 of control) × 100)). A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess data normality whereas significance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (343.7KB, pdf) Supplementary Data 1 (15.7MB, xlsx) Reporting Summary Checklist (67KB, pdf) Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by the NASA Space Biology program (80NSSC18K1465) and Florida Space Institute Space Research Initiative awarded to J.S.F.

    "abstract": "Abstract Coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, octopus) have the largest nervous system among invertebrates that together with many lineage-specific morphological traits enables complex behaviors. The genomic basis underlying these innovations remains unknown. Using comparative and functional genomics in the model squid Euprymna scolopes, we reveal the unique genomic, topological, and regulatory organization of cephalopod genomes. We show that coleoid cephalopod genomes have been extensively restructured compared to other animals, leading to the emergence of hundreds of tightly linked and evolutionary unique gene clusters (microsyntenies). Such novel microsyntenies correspond to topological compartments with a distinct regulatory structure and contribute to complex expression patterns. In particular, we identify a set of microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) broadly enriched in cephalopod nervous system expression. We posit that the emergence of MACIs was instrumental to cephalopod nervous system evolution and propose that microsyntenic profiling will be central to understanding cephalopod innovations. Subject terms: Evolutionary developmental biology, Evolutionary genetics, Molecular evolution",
    "introduction": "Introduction Cephalopods have the largest invertebrate nervous systems and possess many lineage-specific adaptations such as rapid adaptive camouflage, arms with suckers and camera-type eyes. Many cephalopod characteristics evolved convergently to those of vertebrates, which makes them an attractive system to study the genetic basis of wide-scale organismal innovations and the pathways behind their evolution. On a genomic level, the emergence of novel genes, extensive gene duplications, and wide-ranging RNA editing have been described in cephalopod genomes1. Expansions of gene families such as C2H2s, Protocadherins, and GPCRs, and extensive RNA editing allowed the diversification of protein-coding transcripts in the nervous system and is proposed to have played an important role in its evolution. While similar innovations are known from vertebrate genomes, the mechanisms driving the evolution of these features are different: vertebrates went through several rounds of whole-genome duplications that produced large sets of multi-copy genes and the diversification of their functions, there is no indication for similar events in cephalopods1–3. In contrast, it has been suggested that the coleoid cephalopod (squids, cuttlefish, octopus) lineage went through large-scale genome reorganization2,3. A property of metazoan genomes is that local gene order or microsynteny is conserved between even distantly related species4–6. This conservation is supported by functional studies of regulatory constraints, shown in genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs)4,5,7, as well as co-expression of neighboring genes in tissues or cell types8. Early genome assemblies in several coleoids indicate that local gene order has been greatly disrupted, breaking ancient microsyntenies and bringing previously unlinked genes together2,3. This event, potentially at a whole-genome scale, could have affected hundreds of gene families, disrupting the order of genes in comparison to the last common ancestor of coleoid cephalopods and other molluscs. The extent of this event is difficult to estimate due to the lack of chromosomal-scale assemblies in cephalopods. To begin to understand the extent of the genome reorganization and its impact on cephalopod genome biology and evolution, we study the emerging model species Euprymna scolopes (Hawaiian bobtail squid). This species has been at the center of symbiosis research for over 30 years9,10, but is also an attractive model system for evolution and development research due to its small adult size, large egg clutches, and relative ease of culture. To reconstruct the regulatory landscape in the E. scolopes genome, we applied chromosomal conformation capture (Hi-C) and open chromatin profiling techniques (ATAC-seq) as well as collected additional expression data. Hi-C allowed us to both improve the previously published E. scolopes genome assembly as well as to capture the three-dimensional organization of the genome. Using comparative genomic approaches, we describe the global nature of the genome reshuffling in coleoid cephalopods and demonstrate the emergence of many microsyntenic regions that were previously unlinked in other species. Our data also reveals interactions between distant genomic loci (the topological organization of the genome) shedding light on the three-dimensional organization of the E. scolopes genome, as well as identifying genes located in regulatory loops and topologically associating domains (TADs). Our open chromatin data reveals regions accessible to transcription factors and thus potentially constituting regulatory elements. Together, these data allow us to gain insights into the impact of evolutionary changes in gene linkages and the emergence of novel gene regulation. This study provides the basis for the understanding of the evolution of cephalopod genomes and possible implications on morphological novelties in this clade.",
    "methods": "Methods Collection of animals E. scolopes eggs were obtained from cultures and maintained at the Vienna Zoo or at the Marine Biological Laboratory. All work was performed in compliance with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU on cephalopod use and AAALAC guidelines on the care and welfare of cephalopods36. Adult E. scolopes spawned naturally in their tanks, and embryos were collected shortly after spawning and maintained in a closed aquarium system filled with artificial seawater. Embryos developed to the appropriate stage and were anesthetized with 2% Ethanol before use37–39. Hi-C, genome scaffolding, and 3D analysis Hi-C sample preparation was performed as described in Supplementary Note 2. Briefly, Hi-C samples were generated on developmental stage 2740 with 30 pooled embryos using the six base restriction enzyme Hind3. Paired-end sequencing of 50 bp was done on an Illumina HiSeq2500. Hi-C reads were aligned to the reference genome (excluding scaffolds <50k) resulting in over 106 million valid interaction pairs (alignment rate ~71%). Aligned reads were used to scaffold the genome to chromosomal scaffolds. Assembly statistics are summarized in Supplementary Note 2. Raw Hi-C reads were then again mapped to the new chromosomal scaffolds, recovering over 106 million valid interaction pairs (alignment rate ~71%). Three-dimensional modeling of chromosomal scaffolds is described in Supplementary Note 3. For human samples, Hi-C samples of B-lymphoblastoids were downloaded from  (ref. 41, SRR1658570, HIC001) and aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38.p12) obtaining over 144 million valid interaction pairs (~73% alignment rate). Synteny analysis Gene orthology was reconstructed using 27 species spanning all major metazoan clades. Microsynteny was computed using in-house tools as described in detail in Supplementary Note 3. Metazoan synteny was defined as all syntenic blocks shared between at least seven other species. Novel, cephalopod-specific synteny was defined as synteny shared between E. scolopes and at least one octopus species. Random microsyntenies were modeled after the distribution of observed syntenies as described in ref. 8 for 20 iterations. Additional details of the scripts and steps are found in Supplementary Note 3. Chromatin conformation analysis TADs for E. scolopes and Human were called with Tadbit42 with the Tadbit algorithm and with HiCExplorer43. E. scolopes TADs were averaged and the location of the middle of each syntenic cluster was mapped to analyse the distribution of syntenies within TADs. If syntenies spanned several TADs, only the TAD mapping the middle of that synteny was considered. To analyse the topology of microsyntenic clusters further, the normalized Hi-C interaction matrix was used to cluster each bin to its closest neighbor by the bin interaction strength. An interaction cladogram for each chromosome was reconstructed that way. To understand how well a syntenic region is defined by its interactions, we extracted the last common ancestor of that region (i.e., the bins in that region) from the whole tree making up the chromosome. Then the ratio between those sub-trees and the number of bins in a syntenic cluster was calculated and differences between groups were tested using the Wilcoxon test. Chromatin conformation analysis of synteny The center of each syntenic cluster was localized within predicted TAD boundaries. The locations were then normalized and plotted for observed and random microsyntenies. To visualize the differences between observed and random, the ratio between densities of each were calculated and plotted in normalized TAD locations (Fig. 3a). A density over one signifies an enrichment of observed synteny compared to random clusters. A density lower than one signifies a depleted signal of observed synteny compared to random clusters. Random synteny represents clusters sampled from the distribution of observed blocks from random locations in the genome. Co-expression analysis Co-expression coefficients for adult tissues of E. scolopes and O. bimaculoides were computed as described in ref. 8. A detailed description of the steps is provided in Supplementary Note 7. CNE identification The genomes of E. scolopes and O. bimaculoides and of E. scolopes and A. dux were aligned with megablast, using E. scolopes as the query sequence. Five different settings for BLAST44 similarity scores (-perc_identity) were used: 0%, 70%, 80%, 95%, and 98% (Supplementary Figs. 9, 10, Supplementary Table 5, see refs. 4,7,45,46). For further settings see Supplementary Note 8. Multimapping regions were excluded if they overlapped by more than 50% and occurred more than 3 times using BEDOPS47 bedmap. bedmap --count --echo --fraction-both 0.5 --delim '\\t' prefiltered_megablast.bed | awk '$1<4' | cut -f2- |sort-bed - | uniq. Remaining overlapping regions were merged with bedops –merge. Any region overlapping with an exon by 1 bp or more was excluded using bedtools48 subtract. To exclude repetitive regions, fasta sequences were extracted from the filtered putative CNE locations and meme’s49 dust (cut-off 10) function was used to mask repeats. In addition, two datasets were created for each similarity score with a minimum size of 100 bp or 50 bp respectively. For similarity scores of 0%, only 100 bp regions were kept. Any region with more than 25% Ns was excluded. To remove any remaining coding sequences, the remaining putative CNE sequences were blasted against the 50 NR database and any regions overlapping with a BLAST match were removed. Chromatin accessibility assay with ATAC-seq ATAC-seq samples preparation and analysis are described in Supplementary Note 9. ATAC-seq was generated for stages 20, 25, and 28/2940 with two biological replicates each as described in refs. 25,51,52 with slight modifications. Each ATAC-seq library was generated with two biological replicate samples. Samples were sequenced on Illumina HiSeqV4 using 125 bp paired-end reads. The reads were trimmed with BBDuk (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/) and mapped to the chromosomal scaffolds. Peaks were called with Genrich (https://github.com/jsh58/Genrich). After trimming between 72 and 143 million reads remained which were mapped at between 79 and 83% and between 22,443 and 36,933 peaks were called for each sample. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and in situ hybridization (ISH) E. scolopes embryos removed from eggs and jelly layers and hatchlings were anesthetized in 4% EtOH in seawater or 4% EtOH and MgCl2 (2 M solution added slowly to seawater) and subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde38. Sequences of interest were identified from the adult E. scolopes transcriptomes. cDNA of pooled developmental stages was used for PCR with Q5 polymerase. Products were cloned in pjet vectors and isolated with an innuPREP Plasmid Mini Kit (Analytik jena (Jena, Germany)) and sequenced. Riboprobes were generated from amplified minipreps and reverse transcribed with DIG-labeled nucleotides. Details on the FISH and ISH protocol can be found in Supplementary Note 11. Embryos and hatchlings were imaged on an inverted Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) LSM 780 multiphoton Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope.

    "results": "Results and discussion The impact of a large-scale genome reorganization on the coleoid cephalopod genome Linkage information from chromosome conformation capture allowed us to reconstruct 46 chromosomal scaffolds in E. scolopes (“Methods”, Supplementary Notes 1 and 2, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b) based on the published assembly3. We then compared the order of genes with orthologs found in another 24 animal species ranging from sponges to vertebrates, which allowed us to reconstruct microsyntenic blocks shared between different clades (“Methods”, Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 1). Briefly, we define microsyntenic blocks as at least three or more co-occurring orthologous genes with up to five intervening genes with no constraints on their collinearity. This definition of microsynteny yields the fewest false-positive blocks (compared to just pairs of genes) while providing enough flexibility to detect syntenic regions that underwent local rearrangement and expansion. We recover 505 microsyntenies unique to cephalopods, representing blocks of genes only found in close proximity to each other in E. scolopes and at least one octopus species. For the same species sampling and same microsynteny detection parameters only 2 blocks would have been expected by chance (median from 3 rounds of randomization, as described in6). Five out of these 505 blocks were paralogous. In total, only 48 out of 2290 genes in these 505 blocks were identified as orphan genes with no homology outside of cephalopods, while all others have orthologs in other animals, suggesting that the origin of microsynteny was due to changes in gene locations rather than novel gene emergence. These microsyntenies have been conserved in coleoid cephalopods despite their long divergence time (Fig. 1b, c), suggesting an evolutionary constraint that kept those blocks of genes together. Similarly, a comparison in other molluscs, such as the scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis11 and the bivalve Crassostrea gigas showed that a much smaller number of bivalve specific microsyntenies (152) is shared between these species. To infer the set of highly conserved microsyntenic blocks, we reconstructed microsyntenies shared between E. scolopes and at least six more distantly related species out of a set of 23 species (Supplementary Fig. 2). We recovered 275 such metazoan microsyntenies, which are retained in the E. scolopes lineage and are inferred to date back to at least the last common bilaterian ancestor (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2a, “Methods”). In comparison, the bivalve M. yessoensis retains a similar number of metazoan microsyntenies (216). These results provide evidence for a large-scale microsyntenic gain in coleoid cephalopods. Fig. 1.

Blue lines represent cephalopod-specific syntenies shared between either all three cephalopod species (dark blue) or two of the three cephalopod species (light blue) but not present in any non-cephalopod species; gray lines represent other syntenies that do not fall in either of the previous categories.

Inset (left) with locations of genes within two specific syntenic blocks. Chromosomal distribution and properties of metazoan and novel cephalopod microsyntenies Both cephalopod-specific and conserved metazoan microsyntenic blocks are present on 44 out of 46 chromosomal scaffolds (with two chromosomes being too small to contain any microsyntenies). While some chromosomes have higher proportion of novel cephalopod microsyntenies (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c), both microsynteny types are intermixed in the genome (Fig. 1d). This result suggests a genome-wide mechanism for the emergence of novel microsyntenies. The vast majority of single-copy genes (71%) that comprise 232 novel cephalopod microsyntenies are located on different chromosomes in the scallop M. yessoensis. As the organization of the recently published Nautilus genome12 is similar to other molluscs, these results suggest that either many translocations or chromosomal-level fusions occurred in the coleoid ancestor. Genomic properties of novel and conserved microsyntenies Novel cephalopod and conserved metazoan microsynteny show different genomic properties. Novel cephalopod microsyntenies are on average smaller in size than the metazoan microsyntenies still present in cephalopod genomes (Supplementary Fig. 2b), despite having similar numbers of genes (Supplementary Fig. 2c). While introns of genes in cephalopod-specific microsyntenies are smaller than those of metazoan microsyntenies, the majority of size differences stem from intergenic regions (~0.2 kb compared to ~7 kb difference, respectively). We also find evidence for differential enrichment of functional categories between the two microsynteny types. Metazoan microsyntenies6 are enriched in signaling pathway components of the Wnt-signaling pathway, neurotransmitter transport and synaptic vesicle exocytosis, G-protein coupled receptor signaling, negative regulation of transcription, and BMP signaling pathways, among others. Genes in novel, cephalopod-specific microsynteny, on the other hand, play a role in translation, redox processes, regulation of store-operated calcium entry, mRNA cleavage, transport, and chromatin organization (p-values <0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Spatial organization of the E. scolopes genome Three-dimensional chromatin structure including topologically associated domains (TADs) facilitates distant regulatory interactions involved in gene regulation13,14. While very little data exists to-date on invertebrate genome topological organization, we found that in comparison to the data known for vertebrate TAD sizes the interaction distances were generally larger in the squid (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Note 4). TAD prediction tools (see “Methods”) reveal a median E. scolopes TAD size of 2.5 Mb, in comparison to an average of 1.2 Mb in human15. In addition, the distribution of TAD sizes in E. scolopes was considerably wider than in human, suggesting a higher variability. Fig. 2. Topological and spatial organization of the cephalopod genome.

Left and right models are the same, shifted by 90°.In vertebrates, TAD formation is mediated by proteins, such as CTCF and cohesin16,17. We infer that the same mechanisms, including CTCF and the proteins Smc1 and Smc3 of the cohesin complex, are present in the E. scolopes genome and conserved with other animals, suggesting that similar mechanisms may be deployed in cephalopods (Supplementary Fig. 4). We also find TAD boundaries to be enriched for a CCCTC-like motif18–20 reminiscent of a CTCF binding site (Fig. 2c, p = 1e−12, “Methods”, Supplementary Note 4). Topological organization around microsyntenies Several studies suggested the possibility of correspondence between microsynteny and regulatory domains in metazoan genomes4,5,7,8,21–23. To understand the relationship of microsyntenies and TADs we compared the localization of randomly computed microsyntenic blocks, that follow the same properties as our observed blocks but are randomly distributed throughout the genome to the observed microsyntenies (“Methods”). We find a tendency of conserved metazoan microsyntenies to be localized towards the center of the predicted TADs, whereas new cephalopod microsyntenies appear to be more evenly distributed (Fig. 3a).

Ratio increases towards the center of TADs for metazoan syntenies and decreases for cephalopod synteny. b Compactness of novel and metazoan microsynteny, compared to random simulations. Microsyntenic clusters must contain at least 3 genes, if fewer genes were annotated to the tree, these clusters were excluded. Plotted are the ratios between the number of bins (at 40 kb Hi-C resolution, cephalopod micrysynteny bins n = 143,969, metazoan microsynteny bins n = 82,417, random cephalopod microsynteny bins n = 3,499,849, random metazoan microsynteny bins n = 1,889,687) in microsyntenic clusters (within 7 and 25 bins, valid microsyntenies: cephalopod n = 265, metazoan n = 125, random cephalopod n = 4265, random metazoan n = 2180) and the number of “descendant” bins from the last common ancestor of those microsyntenic bins (“Methods”, cephalopod n = 143,969, metazoan n = 82,417, random cephalopod n = 3,499,849, random metazoan n = 1,889,687). The ratio (n = 6835) of the number of bins in a cluster and the number of bins in the sub-tree were compared by two sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing the linked groups (****p < 0.0001, * < 0.05, ns: not significant). The closer the ratio to 1, the lower is the difference between the size of the syntenic block and the number of bins in an extracted tree.

Promotor defined as +10 kb and −10 kb predicted transcription start site.To further study the relationships of genomic regions and their interactions independent of TAD predictions, we computed a tree structure reflecting the organization of each chromosomal scaffold (“Methods”, Supplementary Note 4). Each bifurcating branch reflects the relationships of genomic regions in Hi-C signal strength, allowing us to track interaction intensities in microsyntenies (Fig. 3b). Surprisingly, we found that novel microsyntenies are more likely to form tight interaction regions, reflected by subtrees with few branches, when compared to randomly sampled syntenies (Fig. 3b). This result indicates significantly higher levels of compartmentalization in both cephalopod and ancestral microsyntenies. Motivated by the importance of three-dimensional genome architecture and microsyntenic co-localization in Euprymna scolopes, three-dimensional modeling based on Hi-C interaction matrices was performed (“Methods”, Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Note 5) to provide a deeper understanding of spatial properties and co-localization of both novel and ancient microsyntenic regions within modeled chromosomal scaffolds. Three-dimensional models revealed that novel cephalopod microsyntenies have distinct spatial properties from ancient microsyntenies. In particular, both synteny types showed differential solvent accessibility on some chromosomes when compared to random distributions (Fig. 2d). Moreover, novel cephalopod microsyntenies were on average less buried, thus covering a larger proportion of chromosomal surface (Supplementary Fig. 6). This result was in contrast to the conserved metazoan microsyntenies, which tend to participate in the formation of the chromosomal core (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 6). Since the novel microsyntenies are transcriptionally active (Fig. 3, see below), their location on the chromosomal surface may be reflective of highly dynamic inter-chromosomal regulation, as well as being more accessible to transcription factors. The GC content of metazoan and cephalopod-specific microsynteny was evaluated along with predictions of A/B compartments based on the Hi-C interaction matrix (\"Methods\"). The analysis did not provide sufficient evidence for one of the mycrosyntenic types being more prevalent in either of the compartments. Until further experimental data are available (such as methylation and acetylation profiling) for Euprymna scolopes, we cannot accurately infer the distribution of cephalopod-specific and metazoan microsynteny within A/B compartments. Taken together, the strong genomic conservation among sequenced cephalopods, the comparably tight packaging (short inter-gene distances) of microsyntenic clusters and their prevalent association with defined subcompartments within detected TADs suggests strong selective pressure to maintain regulatory properties of novel microsyntenic units in the cephalopod genomes. Co-expression properties of microsyntenies Co-expression of syntenic genes is an important property that can reflect their regulation. Genes in cephalopod-specific microsyntenies do not tend to be co-expressed, despite their tight co-localization (“Methods”, Supplementary Note 7). When compared to randomly sampled groups of genes that follow a similar distribution to the observed, novel microsyntenies, the mean co-expression coefficient is even slightly lower in the observed data (Wilcoxon test, p ≤ 0.05, Fig. 3c). In contrast, conserved metazoan microsyntenies show significant (Wilcoxon test, p ≤ 0.001) co-expression when compared to simulated microsyntenies (Fig. 3c). This result indicates that genes in metazoan microsynteny tend to co-express in a defined set of tissues, similar to previous findings for ancient metazoan microsynteny8. A similar pattern was also observed for co-expression of novel and conserved metazoan microsyntenies in O. bimaculoides (Supplementary Fig. 7a). No type of microsynteny showed enrichment of expression-specificity in a particular tissue24. To further categorize expression profiles, we investigated averaged expression of syntenic regions. This analysis showed complex patterns that fell into eight distinct expression modules across adult E. scolopes tissues (Fig. 3d, “Methods”, Supplementary Note 7). Although most modules had similar proportions of both microsynteny types, some clusters formed outliers. For example, module 8 showed eye-specific expression and was mostly dominated by metazoan microsynteny. Interestingly, clusters encompassing multiple nervous tissues, in particular modules 2 and 4, were enriched in novel cephalopod microsyntenies (Fisher’s exact test p-values ≤0.02 and ≤1e−07, respectively). Their orthologs were similarly expressed in O. bimaculoides nervous tissues, with novel microsyntenies dominating in modules associated with the strongest brain expression (Supplementary Fig. 7b). However, the overall module correspondence was impacted by the difference in tissue sampling (Supplementary Fig. 7c). We next wanted to investigate whether these expression patterns are biased due to a single highly expressed gene per syntenic block. The vast majority of microsyntenic blocks (76%, Supplementary Fig. 8b) have one gene that contributes to more than 50% of the cumulative expression. We then calculated relative expression levels across tissues per gene and averaged it for each block, showing that overall expression module identities are retained (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In general, expression variance correlates with absolute expression of genes (Supplementary Fig. 8c). In some metazoan syntenies, however, especially in the tissues defining a module, the variance was low, indicating higher co-expression constraints (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Together, these results highlight the complex expression domain contribution of microsyntenic regions and identifies a discrepancy in the co-expression dynamics between novel cephalopod and metazoan microsyntenies. This paucity of co-expression in cephalopod microsyntenies indicates a potentially different mode of their gene regulation. Regulatory signatures of microsyntenies Expression modules showed specific signatures of regulatory motifs associated with them. We predicted regulatory regions using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq25) data from a developmental time course (“Methods”, Supplementary Note 9). Predicted peaks associated with each expression cluster were then further analyzed for known transcription factor motif enrichment, separately for cephalopod and ancient microsynteny (“Methods”, Supplementary Data 2). We find that the cephalopod microsynteny module 2, which is associated with multiple nervous tissues, was enriched for the transcription factors binding motifs Chop26, E2F127, NeuroG228, COUP-TFII29, Atf430 involved in nervous system differentiation and developmental transcription factors ZBTB18, Esrrb, Tcf21, Pitx1, GATA in all three developmental stages (p < 1e−3). Module 4 was similarly enriched in transcription factor binding motifs involved in nervous system and general development such as Tcf3, TCFL2, GATA, Tcf21, and Pitx1 in all three developmental stages (p < 1e−3). This suggests a common regulatory scheme responsible for gene expression in each of the expression modules and an association of those motifs with novel cephalopod microsynteny. To complement our ATAC-seq data, we conducted whole-genome alignments between available cephalopod genomes using different alignment similarity and length thresholds (“Methods”, Supplementary Note 8, Supplementary Table 5, and Supplementary Fig. 9). This helped identify potential conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) and their association with gene bodies and genome topology (“Methods”, Supplementary Fig. 10, Supplementary Note 8). Due to evolutionary distance between squid and octopus lineages, our approach yielded only 1187 coleoid cephalopod CNE candidates with a similarity threshold of 0,95 and a minimum size of 100 bp (Supplementary Table 5), of which 613 could be localized to gene features (Supplementary Fig. 10a–c). 139 were associated with novel cephalopod microsyntenies (inside or within 1 kb of microsynteny), 73 with metazoan syntenies inside or within 1 kb of microsynteny), and 401 were located outside any synteny (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Only 12 of the 1187 candidates had overlap with ATAC-seq peaks (Supplementary Table 5). For CNEs shared among squid genomes we found 42920 putative CNEs with a similarity threshold of 0.95 and a minimum size of 100 bp (Supplementary Table 5), of which 13889 could be localized to gene features (Supplementary Fig. 10a–c). 2444 were associated with novel cephalopod microsynteny (inside or within 1 kb of microsynteny), 3255 with metazoan synteny, and 8190 were located around genes outside any synteny (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Similarly, very few overlapped with ATAC peaks (14). Therefore, the regulatory role of these regions remains unclear. A potential contribution to this observation could be the high evolutionary turnover of regulatory regions within the squid lineage, diminishing the insight gained from genome alignment/conservation-based inferences. Cephalopod genomes are large with over 50% of genome length attributed to repetitive elements2,3. We thus assessed the transposable element composition of ATAC-seq peaks associated with microsyntenic clusters. Both microsynteny types showed an average repeat content of 40%. ATAC-seq peak sequences in cephalopod microsyntenies in E. scolopes showed an elevated repetitive element content of 82% and were most frequently associated with LINE/CR1-Zenon elements (44%, compared to 35% in metazoan microsyntenic peaks). The LINE/CR1 expansion was identified as the most common and specifically expanded repeat element class in the squid (E. scolopes) lineage3. Evolutionary scenarios for functional microsynteny emergence in cephalopods Conserved gene co-localization may be explained by regulatory regions within a neighboring gene, even though the function of the gene may be unrelated (the bystander scenario), together forming a genomic regulatory block (GRB)4,5, or via shared regulatory elements controlling the expression of all syntenic genes, resulting in higher co-expression8. Our microsynteny approach is agnostic to this distinction, focusing on any conserved co-localization of three or more genes. We thus may use our data to independently profile the propensity of metazoan or cephalopod microsyntenies to correspond to known functional microsyntenic models. The location of ATAC-seq peaks within the microsyntenic clusters reveals that open chromatin regions associated with cephalopod-specific microsynteny were more often found in introns than peaks found in conserved, metazoan microsynteny or other non-syntenic genes (Fig. 3e, Fisher’s exact test p < 1e−5). Interestingly, while sharing little overlap, CNE distribution, in particular of CNEs shared among squids, showed significant localization towards distal regions in metazoan syntenies (Fisher’s exact test p < 2.2e−16) (Supplementary Fig. 10). This result indicates that, unlike more conserved microsyntenies, novel cephalopod microsyntenies are more similar to the GRB scenario, in particular the bystander model, in which putative enhancers are found within closely located (bystander) genes inside the same microsyntenic cluster and may potentially lack distal regulatory domains. This observation may also complement the finding of weaker co-expression of microsyntenic genes in cepholopod-specific microsynteny, compared to more ancient, conserved microsyntenies. Given this insight, we further sought to investigate the potential function of novel cephalopod microsyntenies in expression modules 2 and 4 that showed the highest contribution to neuronal tissue expression domains. Such microsyntenies can be considered a useful test set of functional microsyntenies that were involved in the evolution of the cephalopod nervous system. We thus examined the genomic rearrangement, the regulatory landscape, and expression of genes within one of the representative cephalopod-specific microsyntenies from expression module 2. It was one of the clusters with the highest number of genes, encoding for ceramide-1 phosphate transfer protein, phenylalanine-tRNA ligase, splicing factor 3B subunit, integrator complex subunit, and amyloid protein-binding protein. Orthologs of this microsynteny were widely spread across two chromosomes in scallop (Fig. 4a), yet were densely packed in the E. scolopes genome with almost no intergenic space and a few dominant ATAC peaks towards one end of the cluster in the intron of phenylalanine-tRNA ligase (Fig. 4b). Similar to the general trend, this clustering in cephalopods implies either several local translocations or a large-scale chromosomal fusion, followed by rearrangements. The cluster was localized towards the center of the predicted TAD (Fig. 4b), close to another novel microsyntenic unit (from the same expression module). Together, these two units form a compartment of high Hi-C interaction density, separate from the closest metazoan microsyntenic compartment and its associated ATAC-peaks (Fig. 4b). In our three-dimensional chromosomal model, this microsynteny was also found on the surface of chromosomal scaffold 2 (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, the genes in this cluster show nervous system expression both in scallop and E. scolopes (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Note 10). Despite some of these genes being considered as purely metabolic or housekeeping genes, in vertebrates they are known to play an important role in nervous system development and activity31–35. We conducted in situ hybridization to visualize gene expression during development in E. scolopes embryos and confirmed the expression in all major central brain regions (Fig. 5b, c, Supplementary Note 11). However, we also revealed expression in other novel cephalopod tissues and organs, such as the axial nerve cords as well as heart and gills (Fig. 5b, c, Supplementary Fig. 11). This result provides evidence that this microsyntenic cluster and its siblings from expression module 2 could comprise functional microsynteny of the bystander model type that were crucial contributors to the emergence of novel cephalopod expression domains. More generally, the observation of microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) and their further investigation could help dissect the evolution of complex cephalopod tissue expression patterns.

Characterized by megabase-range interactions, cephalopod genomes have been impacted by a genome-wide syntenic reorganization, with an extent that is rare among animal genomes. This reorganization led to the gain of hundreds of cephalopod-specific microsyntenies that are associated with compact topological regions and a distinct mode of gene regulation. Their putative regulatory sequences were often located within the introns of genes within the same microsyntenic cluster, as has been proposed for functional gene linkage in the bystander model. Our analysis of the microsyntenic expression data revealed complex expression patterns of novel microsyntenies associated with a specific set of cephalopod neural tissues and other novel organs. We identify two such expression modules most prominently affected by the emergence of novel cephalopod microsyntenies, each associated with a specific regulatory signature. We propose that this syntenic ‘locking-in’, i.e., high compactness and regulatory streamlining, was responsible for the emergence and extension of ancestral molluscan neural tissue expression domains. As much of cephalopod molecular biology remains elusive, our study proposes the use of these microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) to begin to unravel molecular changes associated with cephalopod developmental and organismal innovations. This study sets the stage for further investigation of MACIs and their roles in the emergence of novel expression domains and organismal innovations in cephalopods.",

Copyright notice ID: 9023564 PMID: 35449136 Abstract Coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, octopus) have the largest nervous system among invertebrates that together with many lineage-specific morphological traits enables complex behaviors. The genomic basis underlying these innovations remains unknown. Using comparative and functional genomics in the model squid Euprymna scolopes, we reveal the unique genomic, topological, and regulatory organization of cephalopod genomes. We show that coleoid cephalopod genomes have been extensively restructured compared to other animals, leading to the emergence of hundreds of tightly linked and evolutionary unique gene clusters (microsyntenies). Such novel microsyntenies correspond to topological compartments with a distinct regulatory structure and contribute to complex expression patterns. In particular, we identify a set of microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) broadly enriched in cephalopod nervous system expression. We posit that the emergence of MACIs was instrumental to cephalopod nervous system evolution and propose that microsyntenic profiling will be central to understanding cephalopod innovations. Subject terms: Evolutionary developmental biology, Evolutionary genetics, Molecular evolution Cephalopods are an enigmatic animal group with complex and adaptive behaviors such as camouflage; however the genetic basis for these traits is not well understood. Here the authors reveal a set of cephalopod-restricted rearranged genomic loci, involving known neuronal regulators but also unexpected gene families, that confer topological organization and gene regulation.Introduction Cephalopods have the largest invertebrate nervous systems and possess many lineage-specific adaptations such as rapid adaptive camouflage, arms with suckers and camera-type eyes. Many cephalopod characteristics evolved convergently to those of vertebrates, which makes them an attractive system to study the genetic basis of wide-scale organismal innovations and the pathways behind their evolution. On a genomic level, the emergence of novel genes, extensive gene duplications, and wide-ranging RNA editing have been described in cephalopod genomes1. Expansions of gene families such as C2H2s, Protocadherins, and GPCRs, and extensive RNA editing allowed the diversification of protein-coding transcripts in the nervous system and is proposed to have played an important role in its evolution. While similar innovations are known from vertebrate genomes, the mechanisms driving the evolution of these features are different: vertebrates went through several rounds of whole-genome duplications that produced large sets of multi-copy genes and the diversification of their functions, there is no indication for similar events in cephalopods1–3. In contrast, it has been suggested that the coleoid cephalopod (squids, cuttlefish, octopus) lineage went through large-scale genome reorganization2,3. A property of metazoan genomes is that local gene order or microsynteny is conserved between even distantly related species4–6. This conservation is supported by functional studies of regulatory constraints, shown in genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs)4,5,7, as well as co-expression of neighboring genes in tissues or cell types8. Early genome assemblies in several coleoids indicate that local gene order has been greatly disrupted, breaking ancient microsyntenies and bringing previously unlinked genes together2,3. This event, potentially at a whole-genome scale, could have affected hundreds of gene families, disrupting the order of genes in comparison to the last common ancestor of coleoid cephalopods and other molluscs. The extent of this event is difficult to estimate due to the lack of chromosomal-scale assemblies in cephalopods. To begin to understand the extent of the genome reorganization and its impact on cephalopod genome biology and evolution, we study the emerging model species Euprymna scolopes (Hawaiian bobtail squid). This species has been at the center of symbiosis research for over 30 years9,10, but is also an attractive model system for evolution and development research due to its small adult size, large egg clutches, and relative ease of culture. To reconstruct the regulatory landscape in the E. scolopes genome, we applied chromosomal conformation capture (Hi-C) and open chromatin profiling techniques (ATAC-seq) as well as collected additional expression data. Hi-C allowed us to both improve the previously published E. scolopes genome assembly as well as to capture the three-dimensional organization of the genome. Using comparative genomic approaches, we describe the global nature of the genome reshuffling in coleoid cephalopods and demonstrate the emergence of many microsyntenic regions that were previously unlinked in other species. Our data also reveals interactions between distant genomic loci (the topological organization of the genome) shedding light on the three-dimensional organization of the E. scolopes genome, as well as identifying genes located in regulatory loops and topologically associating domains (TADs). Our open chromatin data reveals regions accessible to transcription factors and thus potentially constituting regulatory elements. Together, these data allow us to gain insights into the impact of evolutionary changes in gene linkages and the emergence of novel gene regulation. This study provides the basis for the understanding of the evolution of cephalopod genomes and possible implications on morphological novelties in this clade.Results and discussion The impact of a large-scale genome reorganization on the coleoid cephalopod genome Linkage information from chromosome conformation capture allowed us to reconstruct 46 chromosomal scaffolds in E. scolopes (“Methods”, Supplementary Notes 1 and 2, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b) based on the published assembly3. We then compared the order of genes with orthologs found in another 24 animal species ranging from sponges to vertebrates, which allowed us to reconstruct microsyntenic blocks shared between different clades (“Methods”, Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 1). Briefly, we define microsyntenic blocks as at least three or more co-occurring orthologous genes with up to five intervening genes with no constraints on their collinearity. This definition of microsynteny yields the fewest false-positive blocks (compared to just pairs of genes) while providing enough flexibility to detect syntenic regions that underwent local rearrangement and expansion. We recover 505 microsyntenies unique to cephalopods, representing blocks of genes only found in close proximity to each other in E. scolopes and at least one octopus species. For the same species sampling and same microsynteny detection parameters only 2 blocks would have been expected by chance (median from 3 rounds of randomization, as described in6). Five out of these 505 blocks were paralogous. In total, only 48 out of 2290 genes in these 505 blocks were identified as orphan genes with no homology outside of cephalopods, while all others have orthologs in other animals, suggesting that the origin of microsynteny was due to changes in gene locations rather than novel gene emergence. These microsyntenies have been conserved in coleoid cephalopods despite their long divergence time (Fig. 1b, c), suggesting an evolutionary constraint that kept those blocks of genes together. Similarly, a comparison in other molluscs, such as the scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis11 and the bivalve Crassostrea gigas showed that a much smaller number of bivalve specific microsyntenies (152) is shared between these species. To infer the set of highly conserved microsyntenic blocks, we reconstructed microsyntenies shared between E. scolopes and at least six more distantly related species out of a set of 23 species (Supplementary Fig. 2). We recovered 275 such metazoan microsyntenies, which are retained in the E. scolopes lineage and are inferred to date back to at least the last common bilaterian ancestor (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2a, “Methods”). In comparison, the bivalve M. yessoensis retains a similar number of metazoan microsyntenies (216). These results provide evidence for a large-scale microsyntenic gain in coleoid cephalopods. Fig. 1.

Inset (left) with locations of genes within two specific syntenic blocks.Chromosomal distribution and properties of metazoan and novel cephalopod microsyntenies Both cephalopod-specific and conserved metazoan microsyntenic blocks are present on 44 out of 46 chromosomal scaffolds (with two chromosomes being too small to contain any microsyntenies). While some chromosomes have higher proportion of novel cephalopod microsyntenies (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c), both microsynteny types are intermixed in the genome (Fig. 1d). This result suggests a genome-wide mechanism for the emergence of novel microsyntenies. The vast majority of single-copy genes (71%) that comprise 232 novel cephalopod microsyntenies are located on different chromosomes in the scallop M. yessoensis. As the organization of the recently published Nautilus genome12 is similar to other molluscs, these results suggest that either many translocations or chromosomal-level fusions occurred in the coleoid ancestor.Genomic properties of novel and conserved microsyntenies Novel cephalopod and conserved metazoan microsynteny show different genomic properties. Novel cephalopod microsyntenies are on average smaller in size than the metazoan microsyntenies still present in cephalopod genomes (Supplementary Fig. 2b), despite having similar numbers of genes (Supplementary Fig. 2c). While introns of genes in cephalopod-specific microsyntenies are smaller than those of metazoan microsyntenies, the majority of size differences stem from intergenic regions (~0.2 kb compared to ~7 kb difference, respectively). We also find evidence for differential enrichment of functional categories between the two microsynteny types. Metazoan microsyntenies6 are enriched in signaling pathway components of the Wnt-signaling pathway, neurotransmitter transport and synaptic vesicle exocytosis, G-protein coupled receptor signaling, negative regulation of transcription, and BMP signaling pathways, among others. Genes in novel, cephalopod-specific microsynteny, on the other hand, play a role in translation, redox processes, regulation of store-operated calcium entry, mRNA cleavage, transport, and chromatin organization (p-values <0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 3).Spatial organization of the E. scolopes genome Three-dimensional chromatin structure including topologically associated domains (TADs) facilitates distant regulatory interactions involved in gene regulation13,14. While very little data exists to-date on invertebrate genome topological organization, we found that in comparison to the data known for vertebrate TAD sizes the interaction distances were generally larger in the squid (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Note 4). TAD prediction tools (see “Methods”) reveal a median E. scolopes TAD size of 2.5 Mb, in comparison to an average of 1.2 Mb in human15. In addition, the distribution of TAD sizes in E. scolopes was considerably wider than in human, suggesting a higher variability. Fig. 2. Topological and spatial organization of the cephalopod genome.

Left and right models are the same, shifted by 90°.In vertebrates, TAD formation is mediated by proteins, such as CTCF and cohesin16,17. We infer that the same mechanisms, including CTCF and the proteins Smc1 and Smc3 of the cohesin complex, are present in the E. scolopes genome and conserved with other animals, suggesting that similar mechanisms may be deployed in cephalopods (Supplementary Fig. 4). We also find TAD boundaries to be enriched for a CCCTC-like motif18–20 reminiscent of a CTCF binding site (Fig. 2c, p = 1e−12, “Methods”, Supplementary Note 4).Topological organization around microsyntenies Several studies suggested the possibility of correspondence between microsynteny and regulatory domains in metazoan genomes4,5,7,8,21–23. To understand the relationship of microsyntenies and TADs we compared the localization of randomly computed microsyntenic blocks, that follow the same properties as our observed blocks but are randomly distributed throughout the genome to the observed microsyntenies (“Methods”). We find a tendency of conserved metazoan microsyntenies to be localized towards the center of the predicted TADs, whereas new cephalopod microsyntenies appear to be more evenly distributed (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3. Novel cephalopod microsyntenies and their regulatory properties in Euprymna scolopes. Open in a new tab a Ratio between densities of the center of observed and randomized microsynteny locations within normalized TADs. Ratio increases towards the center of TADs for metazoan syntenies and decreases for cephalopod synteny. b Compactness of novel and metazoan microsynteny, compared to random simulations. Microsyntenic clusters must contain at least 3 genes, if fewer genes were annotated to the tree, these clusters were excluded. Plotted are the ratios between the number of bins (at 40 kb Hi-C resolution, cephalopod micrysynteny bins n = 143,969, metazoan microsynteny bins n = 82,417, random cephalopod microsynteny bins n = 3,499,849, random metazoan microsynteny bins n = 1,889,687) in microsyntenic clusters (within 7 and 25 bins, valid microsyntenies: cephalopod n = 265, metazoan n = 125, random cephalopod n = 4265, random metazoan n = 2180) and the number of “descendant” bins from the last common ancestor of those microsyntenic bins (“Methods”, cephalopod n = 143,969, metazoan n = 82,417, random cephalopod n = 3,499,849, random metazoan n = 1,889,687). The ratio (n = 6835) of the number of bins in a cluster and the number of bins in the sub-tree were compared by two sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing the linked groups (****p < 0.0001, * < 0.05, ns: not significant). The closer the ratio to 1, the lower is the difference between the size of the syntenic block and the number of bins in an extracted tree. Violin plots—distribution, boxes—interquartile range (cephalopod = lower 0.06, upper 0.56, metazoan = lower 0.01, upper 0.58, random cephalopod = lower 0.01, upper 0.49, random metazoan = lower 0.01, upper 0.46), bars—median (cephalopod = 0.31, metazoan = 0.28, random cephalopod = 0.18, random metazoan = 0.17), whiskers—furthest sample within 1.5x interquartile range (cephalopod = min 0.002, max 0.94, metazoan = min 0.002, max 0.95, random cephalopod = min 0.002, max 0.96, random metazoan = min 0.002, max 0.96), maximum and minimum ratios: cephalopod = min 0.00189, max = 0.941, metazoan = min 0.00217, max = 0.952, random cephalopod = min 0.00151, max 0.962, random metazoan = min 0.00150, max 0.96. c Co-expression correlation of genes in microsyntenic clusters (cephalopod n = 476, metazoan n = 236, random cephalopod n = 6925, random metazoan n = 4038). The co-expression correlation of metazoan syntenies is higher than that of cephalopod-specific syntenies or random clusters (****p < 0.0001, ***p < 0.001, * < 0.05). Violin plots—distribution, boxes—furthest sample within 1.5x interquartile range (cephalopod = min −0.69, max 0.87, metazoan = min −0.63, max 1.0, random cephalopod = min −0.72, max 0.95, random metazoan min −0.66, max 0.9), bars—median (cephalopod = 0.05, metazoan = 0.15, random cephalopod = 0.07670835, random metazoan = 0.07) outliers were excluded from these numbers. Maximum and minimum values: −1 and 1 in all cases. d Clustering of mean expression per synteny cluster, color-coded by synteny type, expression among Euprymna scolopes adult tissues.

Promotor defined as +10 kb and −10 kb predicted transcription start site.To further study the relationships of genomic regions and their interactions independent of TAD predictions, we computed a tree structure reflecting the organization of each chromosomal scaffold (“Methods”, Supplementary Note 4). Each bifurcating branch reflects the relationships of genomic regions in Hi-C signal strength, allowing us to track interaction intensities in microsyntenies (Fig. 3b). Surprisingly, we found that novel microsyntenies are more likely to form tight interaction regions, reflected by subtrees with few branches, when compared to randomly sampled syntenies (Fig. 3b). This result indicates significantly higher levels of compartmentalization in both cephalopod and ancestral microsyntenies. Motivated by the importance of three-dimensional genome architecture and microsyntenic co-localization in Euprymna scolopes, three-dimensional modeling based on Hi-C interaction matrices was performed (“Methods”, Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Note 5) to provide a deeper understanding of spatial properties and co-localization of both novel and ancient microsyntenic regions within modeled chromosomal scaffolds. Three-dimensional models revealed that novel cephalopod microsyntenies have distinct spatial properties from ancient microsyntenies. In particular, both synteny types showed differential solvent accessibility on some chromosomes when compared to random distributions (Fig. 2d). Moreover, novel cephalopod microsyntenies were on average less buried, thus covering a larger proportion of chromosomal surface (Supplementary Fig. 6). This result was in contrast to the conserved metazoan microsyntenies, which tend to participate in the formation of the chromosomal core (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 6). Since the novel microsyntenies are transcriptionally active (Fig. 3, see below), their location on the chromosomal surface may be reflective of highly dynamic inter-chromosomal regulation, as well as being more accessible to transcription factors. The GC content of metazoan and cephalopod-specific microsynteny was evaluated along with predictions of A/B compartments based on the Hi-C interaction matrix (\"Methods\"). The analysis did not provide sufficient evidence for one of the mycrosyntenic types being more prevalent in either of the compartments. Until further experimental data are available (such as methylation and acetylation profiling) for Euprymna scolopes, we cannot accurately infer the distribution of cephalopod-specific and metazoan microsynteny within A/B compartments. Taken together, the strong genomic conservation among sequenced cephalopods, the comparably tight packaging (short inter-gene distances) of microsyntenic clusters and their prevalent association with defined subcompartments within detected TADs suggests strong selective pressure to maintain regulatory properties of novel microsyntenic units in the cephalopod genomes.Co-expression properties of microsyntenies Co-expression of syntenic genes is an important property that can reflect their regulation. Genes in cephalopod-specific microsyntenies do not tend to be co-expressed, despite their tight co-localization (“Methods”, Supplementary Note 7). When compared to randomly sampled groups of genes that follow a similar distribution to the observed, novel microsyntenies, the mean co-expression coefficient is even slightly lower in the observed data (Wilcoxon test, p ≤ 0.05, Fig. 3c). In contrast, conserved metazoan microsyntenies show significant (Wilcoxon test, p ≤ 0.001) co-expression when compared to simulated microsyntenies (Fig. 3c). This result indicates that genes in metazoan microsynteny tend to co-express in a defined set of tissues, similar to previous findings for ancient metazoan microsynteny8. A similar pattern was also observed for co-expression of novel and conserved metazoan microsyntenies in O. bimaculoides (Supplementary Fig. 7a). No type of microsynteny showed enrichment of expression-specificity in a particular tissue24. To further categorize expression profiles, we investigated averaged expression of syntenic regions. This analysis showed complex patterns that fell into eight distinct expression modules across adult E. scolopes tissues (Fig. 3d, “Methods”, Supplementary Note 7). Although most modules had similar proportions of both microsynteny types, some clusters formed outliers. For example, module 8 showed eye-specific expression and was mostly dominated by metazoan microsynteny. Interestingly, clusters encompassing multiple nervous tissues, in particular modules 2 and 4, were enriched in novel cephalopod microsyntenies (Fisher’s exact test p-values ≤0.02 and ≤1e−07, respectively). Their orthologs were similarly expressed in O. bimaculoides nervous tissues, with novel microsyntenies dominating in modules associated with the strongest brain expression (Supplementary Fig. 7b). However, the overall module correspondence was impacted by the difference in tissue sampling (Supplementary Fig. 7c). We next wanted to investigate whether these expression patterns are biased due to a single highly expressed gene per syntenic block. The vast majority of microsyntenic blocks (76%, Supplementary Fig. 8b) have one gene that contributes to more than 50% of the cumulative expression. We then calculated relative expression levels across tissues per gene and averaged it for each block, showing that overall expression module identities are retained (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In general, expression variance correlates with absolute expression of genes (Supplementary Fig. 8c). In some metazoan syntenies, however, especially in the tissues defining a module, the variance was low, indicating higher co-expression constraints (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Together, these results highlight the complex expression domain contribution of microsyntenic regions and identifies a discrepancy in the co-expression dynamics between novel cephalopod and metazoan microsyntenies. This paucity of co-expression in cephalopod microsyntenies indicates a potentially different mode of their gene regulation.Regulatory signatures of microsyntenies Expression modules showed specific signatures of regulatory motifs associated with them. We predicted regulatory regions using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq25) data from a developmental time course (“Methods”, Supplementary Note 9). Predicted peaks associated with each expression cluster were then further analyzed for known transcription factor motif enrichment, separately for cephalopod and ancient microsynteny (“Methods”, Supplementary Data 2). We find that the cephalopod microsynteny module 2, which is associated with multiple nervous tissues, was enriched for the transcription factors binding motifs Chop26, E2F127, NeuroG228, COUP-TFII29, Atf430 involved in nervous system differentiation and developmental transcription factors ZBTB18, Esrrb, Tcf21, Pitx1, GATA in all three developmental stages (p < 1e−3). Module 4 was similarly enriched in transcription factor binding motifs involved in nervous system and general development such as Tcf3, TCFL2, GATA, Tcf21, and Pitx1 in all three developmental stages (p < 1e−3). This suggests a common regulatory scheme responsible for gene expression in each of the expression modules and an association of those motifs with novel cephalopod microsynteny. To complement our ATAC-seq data, we conducted whole-genome alignments between available cephalopod genomes using different alignment similarity and length thresholds (“Methods”, Supplementary Note 8, Supplementary Table 5, and Supplementary Fig. 9). This helped identify potential conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) and their association with gene bodies and genome topology (“Methods”, Supplementary Fig. 10, Supplementary Note 8). Due to evolutionary distance between squid and octopus lineages, our approach yielded only 1187 coleoid cephalopod CNE candidates with a similarity threshold of 0,95 and a minimum size of 100 bp (Supplementary Table 5), of which 613 could be localized to gene features (Supplementary Fig. 10a–c). 139 were associated with novel cephalopod microsyntenies (inside or within 1 kb of microsynteny), 73 with metazoan syntenies inside or within 1 kb of microsynteny), and 401 were located outside any synteny (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Only 12 of the 1187 candidates had overlap with ATAC-seq peaks (Supplementary Table 5). For CNEs shared among squid genomes we found 42920 putative CNEs with a similarity threshold of 0.95 and a minimum size of 100 bp (Supplementary Table 5), of which 13889 could be localized to gene features (Supplementary Fig. 10a–c). 2444 were associated with novel cephalopod microsynteny (inside or within 1 kb of microsynteny), 3255 with metazoan synteny, and 8190 were located around genes outside any synteny (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Similarly, very few overlapped with ATAC peaks (14). Therefore, the regulatory role of these regions remains unclear. A potential contribution to this observation could be the high evolutionary turnover of regulatory regions within the squid lineage, diminishing the insight gained from genome alignment/conservation-based inferences. Cephalopod genomes are large with over 50% of genome length attributed to repetitive elements2,3. We thus assessed the transposable element composition of ATAC-seq peaks associated with microsyntenic clusters. Both microsynteny types showed an average repeat content of 40%. ATAC-seq peak sequences in cephalopod microsyntenies in E. scolopes showed an elevated repetitive element content of 82% and were most frequently associated with LINE/CR1-Zenon elements (44%, compared to 35% in metazoan microsyntenic peaks). The LINE/CR1 expansion was identified as the most common and specifically expanded repeat element class in the squid (E. scolopes) lineage3.Evolutionary scenarios for functional microsynteny emergence in cephalopods Conserved gene co-localization may be explained by regulatory regions within a neighboring gene, even though the function of the gene may be unrelated (the bystander scenario), together forming a genomic regulatory block (GRB)4,5, or via shared regulatory elements controlling the expression of all syntenic genes, resulting in higher co-expression8. Our microsynteny approach is agnostic to this distinction, focusing on any conserved co-localization of three or more genes. We thus may use our data to independently profile the propensity of metazoan or cephalopod microsyntenies to correspond to known functional microsyntenic models. The location of ATAC-seq peaks within the microsyntenic clusters reveals that open chromatin regions associated with cephalopod-specific microsynteny were more often found in introns than peaks found in conserved, metazoan microsynteny or other non-syntenic genes (Fig. 3e, Fisher’s exact test p < 1e−5). Interestingly, while sharing little overlap, CNE distribution, in particular of CNEs shared among squids, showed significant localization towards distal regions in metazoan syntenies (Fisher’s exact test p < 2.2e−16) (Supplementary Fig. 10). This result indicates that, unlike more conserved microsyntenies, novel cephalopod microsyntenies are more similar to the GRB scenario, in particular the bystander model, in which putative enhancers are found within closely located (bystander) genes inside the same microsyntenic cluster and may potentially lack distal regulatory domains. This observation may also complement the finding of weaker co-expression of microsyntenic genes in cepholopod-specific microsynteny, compared to more ancient, conserved microsyntenies. Given this insight, we further sought to investigate the potential function of novel cephalopod microsyntenies in expression modules 2 and 4 that showed the highest contribution to neuronal tissue expression domains. Such microsyntenies can be considered a useful test set of functional microsyntenies that were involved in the evolution of the cephalopod nervous system. We thus examined the genomic rearrangement, the regulatory landscape, and expression of genes within one of the representative cephalopod-specific microsyntenies from expression module 2. It was one of the clusters with the highest number of genes, encoding for ceramide-1 phosphate transfer protein, phenylalanine-tRNA ligase, splicing factor 3B subunit, integrator complex subunit, and amyloid protein-binding protein. Orthologs of this microsynteny were widely spread across two chromosomes in scallop (Fig. 4a), yet were densely packed in the E. scolopes genome with almost no intergenic space and a few dominant ATAC peaks towards one end of the cluster in the intron of phenylalanine-tRNA ligase (Fig. 4b). Similar to the general trend, this clustering in cephalopods implies either several local translocations or a large-scale chromosomal fusion, followed by rearrangements. The cluster was localized towards the center of the predicted TAD (Fig. 4b), close to another novel microsyntenic unit (from the same expression module). Together, these two units form a compartment of high Hi-C interaction density, separate from the closest metazoan microsyntenic compartment and its associated ATAC-peaks (Fig. 4b). In our three-dimensional chromosomal model, this microsynteny was also found on the surface of chromosomal scaffold 2 (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, the genes in this cluster show nervous system expression both in scallop and E. scolopes (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Note 10). Despite some of these genes being considered as purely metabolic or housekeeping genes, in vertebrates they are known to play an important role in nervous system development and activity31–35. We conducted in situ hybridization to visualize gene expression during development in E. scolopes embryos and confirmed the expression in all major central brain regions (Fig. 5b, c, Supplementary Note 11). However, we also revealed expression in other novel cephalopod tissues and organs, such as the axial nerve cords as well as heart and gills (Fig. 5b, c, Supplementary Fig. 11). This result provides evidence that this microsyntenic cluster and its siblings from expression module 2 could comprise functional microsynteny of the bystander model type that were crucial contributors to the emergence of novel cephalopod expression domains. More generally, the observation of microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) and their further investigation could help dissect the evolution of complex cephalopod tissue expression patterns.

Characterized by megabase-range interactions, cephalopod genomes have been impacted by a genome-wide syntenic reorganization, with an extent that is rare among animal genomes. This reorganization led to the gain of hundreds of cephalopod-specific microsyntenies that are associated with compact topological regions and a distinct mode of gene regulation. Their putative regulatory sequences were often located within the introns of genes within the same microsyntenic cluster, as has been proposed for functional gene linkage in the bystander model. Our analysis of the microsyntenic expression data revealed complex expression patterns of novel microsyntenies associated with a specific set of cephalopod neural tissues and other novel organs. We identify two such expression modules most prominently affected by the emergence of novel cephalopod microsyntenies, each associated with a specific regulatory signature. We propose that this syntenic ‘locking-in’, i.e., high compactness and regulatory streamlining, was responsible for the emergence and extension of ancestral molluscan neural tissue expression domains. As much of cephalopod molecular biology remains elusive, our study proposes the use of these microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) to begin to unravel molecular changes associated with cephalopod developmental and organismal innovations. This study sets the stage for further investigation of MACIs and their roles in the emergence of novel expression domains and organismal innovations in cephalopods.Methods Collection of animals E. scolopes eggs were obtained from cultures and maintained at the Vienna Zoo or at the Marine Biological Laboratory. All work was performed in compliance with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU on cephalopod use and AAALAC guidelines on the care and welfare of cephalopods36. Adult E. scolopes spawned naturally in their tanks, and embryos were collected shortly after spawning and maintained in a closed aquarium system filled with artificial seawater. Embryos developed to the appropriate stage and were anesthetized with 2% Ethanol before use37–39.Hi-C, genome scaffolding, and 3D analysis Hi-C sample preparation was performed as described in Supplementary Note 2. Briefly, Hi-C samples were generated on developmental stage 2740 with 30 pooled embryos using the six base restriction enzyme Hind3. Paired-end sequencing of 50 bp was done on an Illumina HiSeq2500. Hi-C reads were aligned to the reference genome (excluding scaffolds <50k) resulting in over 106 million valid interaction pairs (alignment rate ~71%). Aligned reads were used to scaffold the genome to chromosomal scaffolds. Assembly statistics are summarized in Supplementary Note 2. Raw Hi-C reads were then again mapped to the new chromosomal scaffolds, recovering over 106 million valid interaction pairs (alignment rate ~71%). Three-dimensional modeling of chromosomal scaffolds is described in Supplementary Note 3. For human samples, Hi-C samples of B-lymphoblastoids were downloaded from  (ref. 41, SRR1658570, HIC001) and aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38.p12) obtaining over 144 million valid interaction pairs (~73% alignment rate).Synteny analysis Gene orthology was reconstructed using 27 species spanning all major metazoan clades. Microsynteny was computed using in-house tools as described in detail in Supplementary Note 3. Metazoan synteny was defined as all syntenic blocks shared between at least seven other species. Novel, cephalopod-specific synteny was defined as synteny shared between E. scolopes and at least one octopus species. Random microsyntenies were modeled after the distribution of observed syntenies as described in ref. 8 for 20 iterations. Additional details of the scripts and steps are found in Supplementary Note 3.Chromatin conformation analysis TADs for E. scolopes and Human were called with Tadbit42 with the Tadbit algorithm and with HiCExplorer43. E. scolopes TADs were averaged and the location of the middle of each syntenic cluster was mapped to analyse the distribution of syntenies within TADs. If syntenies spanned several TADs, only the TAD mapping the middle of that synteny was considered. To analyse the topology of microsyntenic clusters further, the normalized Hi-C interaction matrix was used to cluster each bin to its closest neighbor by the bin interaction strength. An interaction cladogram for each chromosome was reconstructed that way. To understand how well a syntenic region is defined by its interactions, we extracted the last common ancestor of that region (i.e., the bins in that region) from the whole tree making up the chromosome. Then the ratio between those sub-trees and the number of bins in a syntenic cluster was calculated and differences between groups were tested using the Wilcoxon test.Chromatin conformation analysis of synteny The center of each syntenic cluster was localized within predicted TAD boundaries. The locations were then normalized and plotted for observed and random microsyntenies. To visualize the differences between observed and random, the ratio between densities of each were calculated and plotted in normalized TAD locations (Fig. 3a). A density over one signifies an enrichment of observed synteny compared to random clusters. A density lower than one signifies a depleted signal of observed synteny compared to random clusters. Random synteny represents clusters sampled from the distribution of observed blocks from random locations in the genome.Co-expression analysis Co-expression coefficients for adult tissues of E. scolopes and O. bimaculoides were computed as described in ref. 8. A detailed description of the steps is provided in Supplementary Note 7.CNE identification The genomes of E. scolopes and O. bimaculoides and of E. scolopes and A. dux were aligned with megablast, using E. scolopes as the query sequence. Five different settings for BLAST44 similarity scores (-perc_identity) were used: 0%, 70%, 80%, 95%, and 98% (Supplementary Figs. 9, 10, Supplementary Table 5, see refs. 4,7,45,46). For further settings see Supplementary Note 8. Multimapping regions were excluded if they overlapped by more than 50% and occurred more than 3 times using BEDOPS47 bedmap. bedmap --count --echo --fraction-both 0.5 --delim '\\t' prefiltered_megablast.bed | awk '$1<4' | cut -f2- |sort-bed - | uniq. Remaining overlapping regions were merged with bedops –merge. Any region overlapping with an exon by 1 bp or more was excluded using bedtools48 subtract. To exclude repetitive regions, fasta sequences were extracted from the filtered putative CNE locations and meme’s49 dust (cut-off 10) function was used to mask repeats. In addition, two datasets were created for each similarity score with a minimum size of 100 bp or 50 bp respectively. For similarity scores of 0%, only 100 bp regions were kept. Any region with more than 25% Ns was excluded. To remove any remaining coding sequences, the remaining putative CNE sequences were blasted against the 50 NR database and any regions overlapping with a BLAST match were removed.Chromatin accessibility assay with ATAC-seq ATAC-seq samples preparation and analysis are described in Supplementary Note 9. ATAC-seq was generated for stages 20, 25, and 28/2940 with two biological replicates each as described in refs. 25,51,52 with slight modifications. Each ATAC-seq library was generated with two biological replicate samples. Samples were sequenced on Illumina HiSeqV4 using 125 bp paired-end reads. The reads were trimmed with BBDuk (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/) and mapped to the chromosomal scaffolds. Peaks were called with Genrich (https://github.com/jsh58/Genrich). After trimming between 72 and 143 million reads remained which were mapped at between 79 and 83% and between 22,443 and 36,933 peaks were called for each sample.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and in situ hybridization (ISH) E. scolopes embryos removed from eggs and jelly layers and hatchlings were anesthetized in 4% EtOH in seawater or 4% EtOH and MgCl2 (2 M solution added slowly to seawater) and subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde38. Sequences of interest were identified from the adult E. scolopes transcriptomes. cDNA of pooled developmental stages was used for PCR with Q5 polymerase. Products were cloned in pjet vectors and isolated with an innuPREP Plasmid Mini Kit (Analytik jena (Jena, Germany)) and sequenced. Riboprobes were generated from amplified minipreps and reverse transcribed with DIG-labeled nucleotides. Details on the FISH and ISH protocol can be found in Supplementary Note 11. Embryos and hatchlings were imaged on an inverted Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) LSM 780 multiphoton Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (2.6MB, pdf) Peer Review File (4.2MB, pdf) 41467_2022_29694_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (80.8KB, pdf) Description of additional Supplementary File Supplementary Dataset 1 (814.6KB, xlsx) Supplementary Dataset 2 (41.8KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (1.3MB, pdf) Acknowledgements H.S., O.P.H., E.R., and O.S. were supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) grant P30686-B29.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Spaceflight is a novel and profoundly stressful environment for life. One aspect of spaceflight, microgravity, has been shown to perturb animal physiology thereby posing numerous health risks, including dysregulation of normal developmental pathways. Microgravity can also negatively impact the interactions between animals and their microbiomes. However, the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by beneficial microbes, such as apoptosis, remains poorly understood. Here, the binary mutualism between the bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, was studied under modeled microgravity conditions to elucidate how this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes.Results Analysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes affiliated with extrinsic/receptor-mediated and intrinsic/stress-induced apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis genes under modeled microgravity conditions occurred earlier and at high levels compared to gravity controls, in particular the expression of genes encoding initiator and executioner caspases. Functional assays of these apoptotic proteases revealed heightened activity under modeled microgravity; however, these increases could be mitigated using caspase inhibitors.Conclusions The outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression and that this process is mediated in part by caspases.

    "methods": "Methods General procedures Adult E. scolopes were collected from Maunalua Bay on O’ahu, Hawai’I, and transported to the Space Life Sciences Lab where they were maintained in a controlled growth chamber set at 23 °C on a 12 h light–dark cycle. Egg clutches laid by the female squid were incubated in separate aquaria from the adults for the entirety of paralarvae development (~ 21 days). Newly hatched paralarvae were rinsed twice in 0.22 μm filtered seawater (FSW), then either preserved in an aposymbiotic state (i.e., without V. fischeri) or rendered symbiotic by inoculation with the wild-type, strain ES114, to a final concentration of 105 cells per mL of FSW. For all experiments, colonization was confirmed by measuring luminescence with an ATP photometer (GloMax 20/20, Promega Corp., Madison, WI). For symbiotic experiments, log cultures of V. fischeri were prepared in seawater tryptone broth [68] and incubated at 28˚C with 225 rpm shaking. For all experiments, animals were anesthetized and euthanized before examination in a 1:1 solution of 0.37 M MgCl2 and filtered sterilized seawater. Euthanasia by over anesthesia is the current accepted practice for cephalopods [69, 70]. Replicates, data treatment, and statistical analyses All experiments were performed in triplicate, with at least three biological and technical replicates unless otherwise noted. Outliers identified via the 1.5 × interquartile range (IQR) method were removed before analysis, and data normality was assessed via Shapiro–Wilk (SW). Statistical significance was evaluated either using a Welch’s t-test (SW p > 0.05) for parametric data or Mann–Whitney-Wilcoxon U test when the data were not normally distributed (SW p ≤ 0.05). Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were two-sided and used a significance cut-off of p ≤ 0.05. Modeled microgravity treatments and DO2 readings To mimic the low-shear fluid conditions of spaceflight, 50-mL High Aspect Ratio Vessels (Fig. 1c; HARVs; Synthecon, Houston, TX) were used as previously described [15]. Briefly, for aposymbiotic conditions, the HARVs were filled with FSW, whereas for symbiotic conditions HARVs contained 105 cells of V. fischeri ES114 per mL of FSW. After animals were added to the HARVs, the reactors were then sealed to prevent the formation of bubbles and incubated at 23 °C in a synchronized LED-illuminated Percival incubator (Percival Scientific Inc., Perry, IA) with rotation at 13 rpm. The HARVs were either rotated around a vertical axis to control for unit gravity (Fig. 1c left) or were rotated around a horizontal axis to mimic microgravity conditions (Fig. 1c right). The dissolved oxygen content (DO2) of the FSW collected from the HARVs was also measured at 24 h with a hand-held probe (Sper Scientific, Scottsdale, AZ) in a minimum of three replicates. For control purposes, and to establish a baseline for enzyme assays and inhibitor treatments, a cohort of hatchling animals were incubated in borosilicate scintillation vials alongside the HARV reactors until 16 h post-hatching, which marks the peak of developmental cell death in normal gravity [18]. For all treatments, at least one animal from each treatment was put aside to confirm colonization and/or quantify light organ apoptosis. The remaining squid were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen or dry ice and stored at – 80 °C until downstream analysis. RNA isolation, quantification, and quality assessment For each treatment, RNA was extracted from three dissected light organs in triplicate and pooled using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the previously described modifications [23]. The resultant RNA was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and assessments of quality were made using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) with the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). For the nCounter analysis, the RNA samples were diluted to a final concentration of 20 ng per mL of nuclease-free water and stored at – 80 °C. Transcriptome analysis and NanoString nCounter Preliminary gene selection was made by data-mining the reference transcriptome of E. scolopes [43] for apoptosis-related KEGG identifiers, GO terms, Pfam accession numbers, and SwissProt annotations (Additional File 1). Target genes were selected for further study by cross-referencing the multi-species KEGG pathway for apoptosis (ko04215) with published analyses in other cephalopods. The selected genes (Table 1; Additional File 2) represent those target genes where probes could be designed. Some apoptosis genes within E. scolopes had numerous isoforms and this not all probes were effective. Three LPS-binding proteins (LBPs) from E. scolopes were also included in the final apoposis-gene CodeSet (Table 1), along with the housekeeping genes actin (actB) and pyruvate carboxylase (pyc1). Probes to the selected target genes were synthesized at NanoString Technologies, Inc. in Seattle, WA. Each assay included eight negative control probes to evaluate the non-specific background and six synthetic RNA targets with matching positive control probes. NanoString quality control, data processing, and differential analysis The raw NanoString counts from the nCounter assay were processed using nSolver software (ver 4.0) as previously described [71]. Quality control was conducted based on imaging quality, probe binding density, positive control linearity, and the limit of detection as established by the negative controls. Non-specific background signal was subtracted, and the data were normalized to the internal controls and housekeeping genes to adjust between technical and biological replicates. Next, the data were imported into R Studio (ver 1.2.1335) and a Shapiro–Wilk test was performed to determine data normality. Afterwards, a LIMMA-voom transformation was applied and the output – expressed as log2 counts-per-million (log2CPM) – was used to fit a linear regression model. Finally, the differential expression analysis was computed for pair-wise comparisons using non-parametric empirical Bayes statistics with a Benjamin-Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing (Additional File 2). Phylogenetic and architectural analysis of caspase enzymes Caspase protein sequences were obtained from the reference transcriptome for Euprymna scolopes [43]. Homologous sequences were similarly sourced from the National Center Biotechnology Information () for other common research organisms (Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Xenopus laevis, Danio rerio) as well as two species (Mytilus galloprovinciali, and Octopus sinensis) within the Mollusca phylum (Additional File 3). To compare initiator and executioner caspases, a multiple sequence alignment was generated via MUSCLE (ver 3.8.31) according to the default parameters [72]. Maximum likelihood analysis was then performed using MEGA X software (ver 10.2.1) assuming the Whelan-Goldman model of amino acid substitution with 1000 bootstrap iterations [73]. The resultant phylogenetic trees were rendered in MEGA X, with branch support values expressed as percentages on the unrooted trees. Separately, the domain architecture of each caspase sequence was analyzed via SMART, InterProScan, and the  Conserved Domain Search [74–76]. Estimates of protein isoelectric point and molecular weight were calculated using the ExPASy Compute pI/Mw tool (Table 2) [77]. The percent identities of the initiator and executioner caspases in E. scolopes were determined via Clustal Omega at the default parameters [78]. Light organ protein isolation and quantification To examine enzyme activity during light organ apoptosis, total protein was isolated from frozen animals. Per extraction, approximately 60 light organs were dissected into an ice-cold hypotonic extraction buffer containing 24 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.4) supplemented with a custom protease inhibitor cocktail to a final concentration of 2 μg pepstatin, 5 μg aprotinin, 5 μg leupeptin, and 100 μg Pefabloc per mL of buffer. The light organs were then homogenized on ice with a ground-glass micromortar and pestle, and the exudate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet out debris. The amount of protein in the supernatant was subsequently determined using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Afterwards, the protein extract was diluted with ice-cold extraction buffer and 5 M NaCl to a final concentration of 1 mg of protein and 0.45 M NaCl per mL of buffer. All protein extracts were stored at – 80 °C until use. For each treatment, protein extractions were performed in triplicate. Caspase activity assays To quantify caspase activity in the light organ, Caspase-Glo Assay kits (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, equal volumes of pre-warmed Caspase-Glo reagent and light organ protein were combined in a white-walled, flat-bottomed, 96 well plate with 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Caspase-Glo 3/7) or 60 μM MG-132 proteasome inhibitor (Caspase-Glo 8 and 9) to reduce non-specific signal. The plate was shaken at 400 rpm for 30 s and then transferred to a Synergy microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) at 25 °C. Luminescence readings were subsequently collected every 2 min for 2 h. Protein samples were prepared in a hypotonic extraction buffer and assayed in duplicate at a final protein concentration of 20 μg per mL of buffer. Duplicate blank reactions consisting of buffer plus proteasome inhibitor were included for each set of samples, and the average was subtracted as background. Protease inhibitor treatments To determine the contributions of different caspases to bacteria-induced apoptosis, hatchling animals were exposed to a series of targeted protease inhibitors. The inhibitors used in this study include the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK, the caspase 8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO, and the caspase 9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CMK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) as well as the irreversible serine protease inhibitor, Pefabloc (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). All inhibitor solutions were 0.22 µm-filter sterilized and stored at – 80 °C until use. Caspase inhibitors were used at final concentrations of 60 and 100 μM for vial and HARV experiments, respectively. For all experiments, the final concentration of the serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc was 25 μM. These concentrations were chosen in part as they did not cause apparent toxicity to the animal and did not impede colonization. Inhibitor treatment occurred for 2 h before the start of the experiment. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) controls were run in parallel where appropriate. Quantifying apoptotic development in the CEA of the light organ To visualize and quantify apoptosis in the light organ, hatchling animals were anesthetized and stained in a 1:1 solution of 0.37 MgCl2 and FSW containing 0.001% acridine orange dye, which intercalates into the condensed chromatin of dying cells (i.e., pycnotic nuclei) [18]. After staining, a ventral dissection was performed to expose the light organ, and the pycnotic nuclei in each lobe of the light organ were counted via FITC epifluorescence microscopy with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).",
    "results": "Results Identification of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis network within the host Euprymna scolopes To elucidate the apoptosis machinery in the bobtail squid, a detailed map of the putative pathways for apoptosis in the squid host was generated by data-mining the reference transcriptome and genome of E. scolopes (Fig. 2). This search identified 293 transcripts, representing 137 unique genes, involved in the regulation of apoptosis in the host squid (Table S1; Fig. S1). The resultant network revealed an elaborate web of parallel and hierarchical interactions and pro-and anti-apoptotic effectors that appear to govern extrinsic, receptor-mediated, and intrinsic, stress-induced cell death via transcriptional, translational, and post-translational means (Fig. 2). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Putative pathways for apoptosis in Euprymna scolopes. The candidates identified from the genome and reference transcriptome included effectors of both extrinsic/receptor-mediated, and intrinsic/stress-associated, apoptosis. Representative interactions were mapped by cross referencing the multi-species KEGG pathway for apoptosis (ko04215) with peer-reviewed literatureFor the extrinsic apoptosis network, two tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily members (Tnfrsf11, Tnfrsf21) and five Tnf-associated factors (Traf 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7) were discovered in E. scolopes (Fig. 2, Table S1). The closely related initiator caspases-8 and -10 were also identified, as well as death domain-associated adaptors Fadd, Daxx, and the stress-associated kinase Ripk1. Interestingly, neither Fas ligand nor its corresponding receptor was found in the reference transcriptome despite the presence of components known to operate downstream (e.g., Fadd). Nevertheless, E. scolopes was determined to harbor all the effectors required to assemble a complete death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) for extrinsic, receptor-mediated apoptosis, which serves as the activation assembly for extrinsic initiator caspases-10 and -8 [27]. Additionally, transcripts associated with three LPS-binding proteins (Lbps) and the LPS-induced transcription factor, Litaf, which have been previously described in E. scolopes [28] were also observed in the putative extrinsic, receptor-mediated network (Fig. 2). With regards to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, transcripts encoding both pro-apoptotic (Bnip3, Bcl10, Bcl2L13, Bax, Bak) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl2L1, Mcl1, Ar1) members of the Bcl2 protein family were found in E. scolopes (Fig. 2; Table S1). A variety of mitochondrial proteins (i.e., Aifm1, Aifm3, Diablo, Cytc, Htra2) were identified as well as Apaf1 and the intrinsic initiator caspase-9. Thus, all the requisite parts of the apoptosome, which is the activation complex of the stress-induced pathway for cell death were found in the bobtail squid (Fig. 2). However, the Bh3-only protein Bid, which typically represents a critical junction for crosstalk between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways for apoptosis in animals, was conspicuously absent. Likewise, the presence of atypical initiator caspase-2 was confirmed along with Pidd1, both of which are constituents of the pro-death, p53-inducible, PIDDosome complex that forms in response to DNA damage [29]; however, no evidence of the third member of this assembly, Raidd/Cradd, was found in the bobtail squid reference transcriptome or genome. In addition to Bcl2-type repressors, transcripts encoding numerous inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (Iaps) were discovered in the host squid. Included among these were Xiap, Diap2, three Baculoviral Iap-repeat containing proteins (Birc7b, Birc3, and Birc6), three Bcl2-associated athanogene regulators (Bag 1, 4, and 6), cell death regulator Aven, the peptidyl isomerase Pin1, as well as heat shock proteins Hsp90 and Hsp7c (Table S1). Further examination revealed the presence of numerous cathepsin (B, K, L, L1, L2, Z) and calpain (1–3, 5, 7–9, 11, B, D) proteases, several of which have been previously reported in E. scolopes [30]. The cathepsins recovered from the reference transcriptome were primarily cysteine-dependent, except for cathepsin B, which is a serine protease. Intriguingly, neither aspartic acid-type cathepsins (D and E) were found in the host squid. Analysis of the E. scolopes reference transcriptome revealed a variety of nucleus-localizing proteins affiliated with apoptosis (Table S1). Broadly, this included transcription factors (i.e., Aatf, Atf4, Jun, E2f, Hox, Irf, Litaf, NF-κB, p73), p53-type transactivators (i.e., Aspp1, Ccar1), and apoptotic mediators of chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (i.e., Acin1, Dffb/Cad, EndoG) (Table S1). Transcripts encoding numerous regulators of apoptotic translation were likewise present in the squid, most notably the eukaryotic initiation factors Eif2, Eif3f, Eif3j, Eif4b, and Eif4e (Table S1). Interestingly, however, no transactivating factors of internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated translation were present in the transcriptome of E. scolopes, and the nuclear lamin protease and executioner caspase, caspase-6, was not observed. Extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression under LSMMG conditions To ascertain the impact of modeled microgravity on the light organ cell death event in the host animal, 41 apoptosis-related genes identified in the reference transcriptome were selected for gene expression analysis using the NanoString nCounter assay (Table 1). These target genes were representative of key components of the apoptosis machinery depicted in Fig. 2. The expression of these target transcripts was quantified over time in hatchling paralarvae incubated within the HARVs under LSMMG and gravity control conditions in the presence and absence of the symbiotic bacterium V. fischeri ES114. Overall, the NanoString results indicated that there was an increase in the transcription of genes associated with both receptor-mediated and stress-induced apoptosis under LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls (Fig. 3, 4).

Heatmaps representing the transcriptional expression of pro-death caspases -2, -3, -8, -9, and -10 genes in gravity (left) and LSMMG (right) conditions. Per the color scale, red indicates a negative Z-score and lower-than-average expression, whereas green signifies a positive Z-score and higher-than-average expressionWith regards to effectors of extrinsic, receptor-mediated, apoptosis, the LPS binding proteins 1 and 3, along with the endotoxin-induced transcription factor Litaf were significantly up-expressed in modeled microgravity between 6 and 10 h post-hatching (Fig. 3). Likewise, transcripts encoding the adaptor protein Fadd were more abundant during the early hours of development in LSMMG; however, these results were not statistically significant from the gravity controls (Fig. 3). A similar trend was observed in the NanoString results for genes affiliated with intrinsic, stress-induced apoptosis. The Bh3-only protein Bnip3, membrane permeabilizer Bak, Diablo, and caspase-dependent Aifm3 were significantly up expressed in LSMMG between 8 and 12 h compared to gravity controls (Fig. 3). Bnip3, which overcomes Bcl-2 type suppression of pro-death effectors Bax/Bak, increased overtime under LSMMG peaking at 16 and 18 h in LSMMG compared to the unit gravity controls (Fig. 3). Bnip3 is known to be induced under hypoxic conditions, however, measurements of the dissolved oxygen content were consistent across all treatments at 24 h revealing no difference in oxygen availability in the HARVs (Fig. S2). Expression of pro-death caspases in host animal under LSMMG conditions The identification of caspase-2, -3, -7, -8, -9, and -10 transcripts in the reference transcriptome suggested the presence of canonical pathways for extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis in E. scolopes (Fig. 4). Additionally, caspase-driven apoptosis has a known role in the bacteria-induced development of the light organ, given that treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK has been shown to reduce the number of dying cells observed at 24 h post-inoculation [30]. These results suggested that caspase regulation, either at the level of mRNA and/or protein, was a contributing factor to the accelerated developmental timeline of apoptosis in the host light organ under LSMMG conditions (Fig. 1d). NanoString analysis was used to examine the differential gene expression of the putative initiator (i.e., casp2, casp8, casp9, and casp10) and executioner (i.e., casp3) caspase genes in symbiotic and aposymbiotic squid under microgravity and gravity conditions. Results revealed that under LSMMG conditions there was a pronounced increase in the pro-death caspase transcripts between 6 and 10 h post-colonization by V. fischeri (Fig. 4), which aligns with early-onset apoptosis previously observed in paralarvae squid exposed to modeled microgravity [15]. Aposymbiotic control animals that were not exposed to V. fischeri showed no differential expression under LSMMG or gravity conditions at these same time points (Fig. S3). The architecture of caspase domain structure in Euprymna scolopes To evaluate the extent of similarity between the E. scolopes caspase (EsCasp) enzymes and homologs in other animals, the domain architecture of EsCasps was mapped and compared to sequences derived from Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Danio rerio, and Xenopus laevis (Fig. 5). Additionally, the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and the East Asian octopus, Octopus sinensis, were included in the analysis to distinguish lineage-specific modifications within the Mollusca phylum and/or among cephalopods (Fig. 5, Additional File 3). Domain analysis via SMART, InterProScan, and the  Conserved Domain Database, as described in the Methods, revealed that the architecture of caspases-2, -3, -7, -8, and -9 in E. scolopes is largely consistent with that of other animals, including both vertebrates and invertebrates alike (Fig. 5). Typically, the EsCasps ranged from 327 to 634 residues in length and weighed between 41.4 and 72.1 kDa (Table 2). The main exception to this was EsCasp10_2X, which was only 297 amino acids long and had a molecular weight of 34.4 kDa (Table 2). Fig. 5.

For example, the extrinsic initiator caspase-8 of E. scolopes (EsCasp8) exhibited dual twin death effector domains (DED) at the N-terminus, which is characteristic of both vertebrates and invertebrate caspase-8 proteins; however, this dual DED domain was missing in the initiator EsCasp10 isoforms when compared to vertebrates H. sapiens, D. rerio, and X. laevis (Fig. 5). EsCasp10 did harbor a singular caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), suggesting a potential misannotation. The CARD domain was also observed in EsCasp2 and -9 initiator caspases, which is typical of most vertebrates and invertebrates (Fig. 5). Interestingly, caspase-9 in M. galloprovincialis (MgCasp9) exhibited dual DED in place of the traditional CARD, suggesting a potential misannotation of this protein in M. galloprovincialis. In all sequences examined, a carboxyl-terminal catalytic (CASc) domain was present (Fig. 5, yellow box). The CASc is a 45 kDa precursor that is cleaved during activation to yield the p20 and p10 subunits. Intriguingly, despite the presence of a complete CASc, analysis of EsCasp2_2x and EsCasp9 revealed the smaller p10 subunit was not detected in these two isoforms. Executioner caspases-3 and -7 in animals typically lack pro-domains and are therefore shorter as a result (Fig. 5). The executioner caspases of E. scolopes (EsCasp3 and -7) varied from 213 to 370 residues in length and had a molecular weight ranging from 23.9 to 41.5 kDa (Table 2; Table S2), thus were comparable to both the vertebrate and invertebrate species targeted in this analysis. Most EsCasp3 and -7 isoforms exhibited a conserved QACRG pentapeptide in the catalytic region or equivalent (Table 2). Phylogenetic analysis of host squid caspases Maximum likelihood analysis of the initiator caspases revealed two distinctive clusters primarily consisting of caspases-8, -9 and -10, and caspase-2, respectively (Fig. 6a), that were reflective of the function of whether the initiator caspases were activated by extrinsic or intrinsic triggers. EsCasp8 clustered with all other caspase-8 proteases sourced from  but was closest to proteases from O. sinensis. Similarly, EsCasp2 also branched closely with both invertebrate and vertebrate caspase-2 initiators. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the caspase enzymes in E. scolopes, H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, D. rerio, X. laevis, M. galloprovincialis, and O. sinensis. a Unrooted phylogenetic tree for initiator caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10. b Unrooted phylogenetic tree for executioner caspase-3 and -7. Both trees were generated assuming the WAG model of amino acid substitution, with 1000 bootstrap iterations, in MEGA X. Branch support values are expressed as percentages. Sequences are labeled with the first letter of the corresponding genus and species (e.g., Euprymna scolopes, Es)Unexpectedly, EsCasp9 clustered with the two sequences that were likely misannotated as isoforms of caspase-10. Although the monophyly of the group is indeterminate due to the low outer branch support value (42%), these sequences share several distinguishing features that suggest they may represent a group of caspase-9-like initiators that is specific to Euprymna (Fig. 6a). First, the domain organization of EsCasp9, EsCasp10_1X, and EsCasp10_2X emulates that of canonical caspases -2 and -9, with an N-terminal CARD domain and a C-terminal CASc region (Fig. 5). Second, although the sequences of this group exhibit 94 to 95% identity with one another, their percent identity scores with the other initiator caspases are very low, between 15 and 29%, which indicates they may have distinct structural features (Fig. S4). Third, EsCasp9, EsCasp10_1X, and EsCasp10_2X all exhibit a conserved “QACQP” catalytic pentapeptide (Table 2). Caspases, uniformly, possess a QACXG motif in the active site, with the middle position specifying the catalytic cysteine residue [31]. Given its crucial importance to the protease activity of caspases, variations within this pentapeptide are limited and may denote similar functions. The maximum likelihood estimation of executioner caspases formed two several distinctive groups primarily separated into vertebrate and invertebrate clusters (Fig. 6b). For example, the vertebrate caspases-7 and -3 from H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, D. rerio, and X. laevis formed distinctive groupings, that excluded most of the molluscan isoforms. Interestingly, two caspase-7 isoforms from E. scolopes (EsCasp7_2X and EsCasp7_4X) had a higher association with the vertebrate executioner caspases than the other molluscan orthologs for caspase-3 and -7 (Fig. 6b). This phylogeny may allude to a greater degree of differentiation, or perhaps expansion, among the executioner caspases of the squid, which has previously been documented in bivalves [32, 33]. However, the percent identity among the executioners was 47% which makes it difficult to discern whether these sequences represent isoforms of the same gene(s) or an expansion of caspases-3 and -7 in E. scolopes (Fig. S4). Overall, there appeared to be a relatively high degree of similarity among the executioner caspases of E. scolopes. However, the close affiliation of EsCasp7_2X and EsCasp7_4X with vertebral orthologs suggests the presence of at least two distinct executioner-type caspases in the squid. Unsurprisingly, both the initiator and executioner caspases of E. scolopes were most closely related to O. sinensis, and to a lesser extent, M. galloprovincialis, which is consistent with their categorization as both soft-bodied cephalopods and, more broadly, mollusks. Caspase activity and mitigation during the onset of symbiosis and light organ morphogenesis under LSMMG and gravity conditions The activities of executioner caspases-3/7, extrinsic initiator caspase-8, and intrinsic initiator caspase-9 were quantified in host animals in the presence and absence of the symbiont V. fischeri using Caspase Glo activity kits. Note, due to the similar mechanisms of activity, the kits could not resolve between caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities. All caspases tested were significantly more active in symbiotic animals at 16 h post-colonization, the peak of cell death [19], compared to 16 h aposymbiotic controls and newly hatched paralarvae (Fig. 7). In all three treatments, there was a 26-fold increase in executioner caspase activity (Fig. 7a) compared to the extrinsic and intrinsic initiators (Fig. 7b, c). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Caspase activity and protease inhibition during bacteria-induced apoptosis in the normal squid-vibrio symbiosis. The activity of a executioner caspase-3/-7, b extrinsic initiator caspase-8, and c intrinsic initiator caspase-9 was measured in the light organs of hatchling, 16 h aposymbiotic (apo), and 16 h symbiotic (sym) squid. d Apoptosis was quantified at 16 h after protease inhibitor treatment including pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (ZVAD), the caspase 8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO (C8i), caspase 9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CMK (C9i), Pefabloc (Pefa) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) controls. Error bars are the standard error of the mean. Asterisks denote significant differences between the datasets test (* = p ≤ 0.05, ** = p ≤ 0.01). Comparisons that were not significant are labeled “ns”To test whether the caspases could be inhibited in the host animals, pre-treatment with inhibitors targeting different caspases was used. Treatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, and the serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc for two hours prior to the start of the symbiosis significantly reduced apoptotic cell levels at 16 h in symbiotic hatchlings compared to untreated symbiotic controls but did not completely inhibit apoptosis (Fig. 7d). Interestingly, although the Caspase-Glo assays indicated caspase-9 was active during the apex of cell death (Fig. 7c), treatment with the caspase-9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CMK did not reduce the level of pycnotic nuclei observed at 16 h relative to the untreated or DMSO-treated controls (Fig. d). Additionally, the coupling of different inhibitors showed no additive effects (Fig. 7d). The colonization of the host squid did not appear to be affected as symbiotic animals exhibited normal luminescence levels throughout the experimental treatments. To elucidate the effects of LSMMG stress on caspase activity, 10 h symbiotic animals were examined with Caspase Glo activity kits (Fig. 8). This time point was chosen as it coincided with the higher expression of caspase transcripts in LSMMG (Fig. 4). Results indicated that LSMMG-treated animals exhibited higher levels of caspase-3/7 and caspase-8 activity compared to gravity conditions in symbiotic animals (Fig. 8a, b). Interestingly, no differences were observed in caspase-9 activity in symbiotic animals incubated under LSMMG or gravity conditions, (Fig. 8c). Executioner activity was observed to be several orders of magnitude higher than both initiator caspases, exhibiting up to a 32-fold increase compared to the initiator caspases in both aposymbiotic and symbiotic animals (Fig. 8a-c). Treatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, and the serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc abrogated the significant increase in light organ apoptosis observed at 10 h in LSMMG in symbiotic animals (Fig. 8d).

    "discussion": "Discussion As humans prepare for space exploration beyond low Earth orbit, it will be critical to fully understand the impact that spaceflight has on mutualistic animal-microbe interactions. Maintaining a healthy microbiome during long-duration spaceflights will require a comprehensive assessment of the effects that environmental stresses, such as microgravity, have on the bacteria-induced development of host tissues [12, 34]. To address this key issue in space biology, we examined the effects of simulated microgravity on the beneficial association between Euprymna scolopes and Vibrio fischeri, specifically focusing on the phenomenon of bacteria-induced apoptosis in the light organ of the squid host. The outcomes of this study indicated that (i) E. scolopes harbors a rich network of genes involved in both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic regulation; (ii) the presence of symbiotic bacteria and LSMMG-stress altered the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression; (iii) the normal, bacteria-induced apoptosis in the squid light organ is mediated in part by caspases that exhibit increased activity under LSMMG; and (iv) the LSMMG-associated increase of caspase activity can be pharmacologically mitigated with inhibitors. Apoptosis is a critical pathway for animal development playing key roles in tissue homeostasis, antimicrobial defense as well as innate and adaptive immune responses [35, 36]. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to discern the effects of the microbiome on apoptosis [37, 38] and how this vital form of physiological cell death is altered by microgravity [13, 39]. Although E. scolopes has served as a model organism for decades, the pathways by which the symbiont V. fischeri induces apoptotic cell death have not been fully delineated with only a few effectors identified [28, 40–42]. The recent sequencing of the E. scolopes genome and reference transcriptome has enabled critical animal pathways, including apoptosis, to be investigated [43]. Analyses revealed that E. scolopes harbors genes associated with both primary pathways for cell death that are typically seen in animals, including death-receptor mediated extrinsic pathways as well as intracellular stress-induced intrinsic pathways (Fig. 2; Fig. S1; Additional File 1). Results also suggest that E. scolopes may form distinct caspase activation platforms, particularly regarding the extrinsic, receptor-mediated, pathway. For example, the absence of Cradd in E. scolopes, as well as in the octopus genome, suggests that cephalopod caspase-2 exerts its pro-apoptotic effects outside the PIDDosome complex, likely in association with Tnf receptor signaling [44, 45]. Intriguingly, for 15 apoptosis candidates in the reference transcriptome of E. scolopes, no proteins of significant similarity were found in the SwissProt database via BLASTx or BLASTp (Additional File 1). These queries were initially identified based on possessing a CARD- or DED-domain and preliminary BLASTp analysis using non-redundant  database returned mostly uncharacterized and predicted caspase-interacting protein in other cephalopods. Accordingly, these unknown candidates may represent novel apoptotic effectors within the Mollusca phylum. In general, cephalopods appear to possess a more expansive vertebrate-like repertoire of intrinsic apoptosis genes than other mollusks, including Bnip3, Bax, Apaf1, Htra2, and Pidd [32, 46, 47]. These results suggest that apoptosis has undergone substantial lineage-specific modifications within the Mollusca phylum, which may have resulted in distinct mechanisms of induction. For example, caspase-9 proteins have been described in the mussel M. galloprovincialis despite the lack of Apaf1, which is a critical component of the apoptosome complex in other animals [33, 47]. Under the stress of LSMMG conditions, however, there was an acceleration and increased expression of the transcripts associated with bacteria-induced apoptosis genes in symbiotic animals, specifically related to extrinsic, receptor-mediated cell death (Fig. 3). The increased transcriptional response in symbiotic animals was primarily observed among PRR elements for LPS, including LPS-binding proteins Lbp1 and Lbp3, as well as the LPS-induced transcription factor Litaf (Fig. 3). Elevated concentrations of Lbps have been observed in blood plasma of astronauts returning from shuttle missions, as well as the sera of mice following two days of hindlimb suspension [48, 49]. In E. scolopes, however, previous work has demonstrated that Lbps1 exhibits a symbiosis-specific function and contributes to bacteria-induced apoptosis in the light organ of E. scolopes [28]. Little is known about the functions of Lbp2 and Lbp3 in E. scolopes and the precise mechanisms by which symbiotic paralarvae identify LPS remain unclear [50]. However, mammalian Lbps facilitate the receptor-based recognition of gram-negative endotoxin [28], which raises the possibility that the Lbps of E. scolopes may be responsible for the delivery of symbiont LPS to death receptors on target host cells, thereby promoting extrinsic apoptosis throughout the ciliated epithelium of the light organ. Additionally, previous studies have shown that LSMMG can increase the shedding of reactogenic LPS by V. fischeri [16], thus the combined increase in available MAMP shedding coupled with the increased expression of Lbp1 and Lbp3 receptors in LSMMG may facilitate the accelerated extrinsic apoptosis response in the symbiotic animals under modeled microgravity conditions. In symbiotic hatchlings, the expression of genes associated with intrinsic, stress-induced, cell death was also increased under LSMMG conditions, specifically within the window of 10 to 12 h post-bacterial colonization (Fig. 3). This increase included the Bh3-only protein Bnip3, the membrane permeabilizer Bak, as well as the mitochondrial proteins Diablo and Aifm3 (Fig. 3). Previous studies with space shuttle-flown murine embryonic stem cells have also shown a similar up-regulation of intrinsic apoptosis-associated genes, including Bnip3 [51]. Bh3-only proteins are the sentinels of stress-induced apoptosis and form the molecular basis of crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Bnip3 expression is known to be induced by hypoxia-dependent signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS), both of which are elements of oxidative stress [52, 53]. Although no evidence of hypoxia was observed in the HARVs during the experimental conditions (Fig. S2), reactive oxygen and nitric oxide stress are critical components during the onset of the squid-vibrio symbiosis [54, 55]. Indeed, the phenomenon of spaceflight and microgravity-induced oxidative stress has been extensively documented in astronauts and many other model organisms and cell lines [23, 56, 57]. Consequently, the up expression of Bnip3, Bak, Diablo, and Aifm3 implies that modeled microgravity-derived oxidative stress may compound the normal, bacteria-induced, development of the light organ in E. scolopes via atypical stimulation of the intrinsic pathway. The results also indicated that the expression of pro-death caspases was increased in symbiotic animals under modeled microgravity. Caspases are cysteine-dependent proteases that are widely regarded as the “core machinery” of apoptosis and are responsible for mediating the initiation and fallout associated with most known pathways for cell death [58]. This study found that both initiator and executioner-type caspases were up-expressed during accelerated light organ apoptosis in modeled microgravity-treated symbiotic hatchlings compared to gravity controls (Fig. 4). The detection of functional caspase enzymes in aposymbiotic controls in the absence of apoptotic cells in the light organ suggests that there is a critical execution threshold for cascade activation. Thus, it appears that the superficial ciliated epithelial cells of E. scolopes light organ are “primed” for morphogenesis via baseline levels of initiator and executioner caspase activity that are maintained below the activation threshold for apoptosis until the symbiotic cues for development, such as LPS, are received. In symbiotic hatchlings, the increase of transcripts encoding pro-death caspases under LSMMG conditions coincided with the early onset and premature peak of developmental cell death (i.e., 6 – 10 h post inoculation) previously observed in the squid [15]. Notably, the amount of initiator caspase has been shown to positively correlate with the extent of downstream executioner activation, and to irreversibly induce apoptosis a certain threshold of activity must be surpassed [59]. These results suggest that the increased caspase expression in LSMMG may lower the activation threshold of light organ apoptosis due to the increased availability of proenzymes, which closely parallels previous reports that the concentrations of pro-caspases-9 and -3 are key predictors of apoptotic susceptibility [60]. The initiators and executioners of E. scolopes exhibited a high degree of structural similarity to the orthologs of other animals in particular initiators EsCasp2 and EsCasp8 as well as executioners EsCasp3 and EsCasp7 [61, 62]. However, anomalies were observed in both isoforms of squid caspase-10, which contained a single CARD at the N-terminus rather than a dual DED (Fig. 5). This significant deviation from the structural norm indicates that the EsCasp10 sequences were likely misannotated, given that their structure more closely resembles that of initiator caspases-2 and -9 [63]. Additionally, there were deviations in the CASc precursor domain of several caspase isoforms in the host squid, such as EsCasp2_2X and EsCasp9, where the smaller p10 subunit was not observed (Fig. 5). In animals, the primary sequence of the p10 subunit is subject to greater variation than the larger p20 due to the absence of catalytic cysteine and histidine residues, which may have precluded its detection in EsCasp2_2X and EsCasp9. Given that an intact CASc region was identified within these isoforms it is like these two isoforms are functional despite the inability to identify the p10 subunits within the CASC precursor domain. Maximum likelihood analysis demonstrated that the initiator caspases of E. scolopes, H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, D. rerio, X. laevis, M. galloprovincialis, and O. sinensis clustered primarily based on like orthologs (Fig. 6). The segregation of initiators into three groups bearing high identity to caspases-8 and -10, -9, and -2 is largely consistent with previous phylogenetic analyses that illustrated further subdivisions between the vertebrates and invertebrates [32, 33]. The exclusion of E. scolopes and M. galloprovincialis from the subclade of vertebral caspase-9 orthologs, along with their placement on opposing branches of the unrooted phylogenetic tree next to same-species sequences, implies that lineage-specific variations have occurred in the intrinsic initiator caspases of mollusks (Fig. 6). The increased activity of all tested caspases in symbiotic animals relative to aposymbiotic controls suggests both receptor-mediated and stress-induced apoptosis pathways occurring in the bacteria-induced development of the host light organ (Fig. 7). However, inhibition of caspases under unit gravity resulted in a decrease of only 50% of apoptotic pycnotic nuclei, suggesting that the normal V. fischeri-induced apoptosis pathways in the light organ of E. scolopes are partially, but not entirely, caspase-dependent. These results align with the previous finding that cathepsin L – a lysosomal, cysteine-dependent protease – also contributes to developmental cell death in symbiotic paralarvae [30], suggesting apoptosis in the host animals is mediated by a multi-faceted array of apoptosis-associated proteases that are triggered by both external and intrinsic signals. Under the stress of LSMMG, however, our findings suggest that the increase in apoptotic cell death levels in symbiotic light organs is mediated primarily through caspase activation via the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The phenotype of increased apoptotic nuclei in the light organ under LSMMG was mitigated using caspase inhibitors, producing statistically equivalent numbers of pycnotic nuclei compared to unit gravity controls (Fig. 8d). These increases in caspase activity complement our previous findings that GO terms related to enzymatic activity and catalysis were disproportionately enriched in LSMMG-treated paralarvae at 12 and 24 h compared to gravity controls [23]. These data also parallel previous studies that showed spaceflight and modeled microgravity-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes and erythrocytes was significantly reduced by caspase inhibition [64, 65]. Although most initiator and executioner caspases were up expressed in LSMMG conditions, not all were pharmacologically inhibited. Interestingly, treatment with the Ac-LEHD-CMK caspase-9 inhibitor did not produce a significant reduction in the amount of apoptosis observed under gravity conditions in symbiotic animals (Fig. 7d). Additionally, no LSMMG-induced increase was observed in the caspase-9 activity, despite the increase in transcript levels at 10 h (Fig. 4; Fig. 8). Given that the recognition peptide of the caspase-9 inhibitor is identical to that of the Caspase-Glo substrate (LEHD-CMK), it is unlikely that this phenomenon derives from differences in binding affinity or substrate specificity with the caspase-9 of E. scolopes. Caspase-9 has traditionally been considered an upstream caspase that depends on the binding to the CARD motif Apaf-1 apoptosome for activation [46] and is the first caspase of the ROS-regulated mitochondrial apoptotic cascade [66]. Thus, these results suggest there could be alternative pathways for the onset of executioner caspases in the host squid other than caspase-9-dependent pathways. For example, apoptosis can be activated through apoptosome-independent mechanisms [67], thus more research is needed to understand the role of caspase-9 under both gravity and LSMMG conditions.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that external stresses, such as modeled microgravity, can cause perturbations to the normal apoptotic pathways in animals. As many of the mechanisms that E. scolopes use to communicate with V. fischeri are present in other animals (e.g., Lbps) this research provides a framework for understanding how animals respond differentially to the stresses of spaceflight in the presence and absence of their symbionts. For spaceflight, understanding how disruptions in host-microbe homeostasis and animal physiology alter normal physiological responses, such as apoptosis, is critical. Furthermore, the ability to modulate the life or death of a cell as well as identify mitigation targets or strategies to prevent perturbations of animal-microbe homeostasis has immense therapeutic potential for maintaining crew health for long-duration spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 9389742 PMID: 35982413 Abstract Background Spaceflight is a novel and profoundly stressful environment for life. One aspect of spaceflight, microgravity, has been shown to perturb animal physiology thereby posing numerous health risks, including dysregulation of normal developmental pathways. Microgravity can also negatively impact the interactions between animals and their microbiomes. However, the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by beneficial microbes, such as apoptosis, remains poorly understood. Here, the binary mutualism between the bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, was studied under modeled microgravity conditions to elucidate how this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes.Results Analysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes affiliated with extrinsic/receptor-mediated and intrinsic/stress-induced apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis genes under modeled microgravity conditions occurred earlier and at high levels compared to gravity controls, in particular the expression of genes encoding initiator and executioner caspases. Functional assays of these apoptotic proteases revealed heightened activity under modeled microgravity; however, these increases could be mitigated using caspase inhibitors.Conclusions The outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression and that this process is mediated in part by caspases. Modeled microgravity-associated increases of caspase activity can be pharmacologically inhibited suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining animal-microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12866-022-02614-x.Keywords: Symbiosis, Apoptosis, Caspases, MicrogravityBackground Microgravity is a profound source of physiological stress in animals during spaceflight. A reduction in Earth’s gravity can significantly change the shear forces, buoyancy-driven convection, and hydrostatic pressures that organisms experience [1], thus altering critical biological pathways at the cellular, subcellular, and molecular level [2]. One such pathway that can be negatively impacted during spaceflight and microgravity analogs conditions is apoptosis or programmed cell death. Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process that eliminates damaged and unnecessary cells without inflammation and constitutes a critical lever of physiological homeostasis in multicellular organisms [3]. Anomalies in programmed cell death have been attributed to some of the most debilitating health effects of spaceflight, including muscular atrophy, bone demineralization, immune system dysregulation, cardiovascular deconditioning, and visual impairment [4, 5]. Additionally, rodent studies conducted with the hindlimb unloading model, which mimics the reduced weight-bearing of spaceflight through a 30° head-down tilt, have reported higher rates of myonuclear and osteocytic apoptosis during muscular atrophy and bone loss [6, 7]. Other studies have shown that exposure to actual or simulated microgravity conditions can induce apoptosis in the leukocytes of humans and mice, with effects lingering for up to a week post-flight [8, 9]. Endothelial cells (e.g., coronary arteries) also exhibit increased mortality under microgravity conditions [10], which may contribute to cardiovascular deterioration in flight. Collectively, these findings indicate a more intricate understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying microgravity-induced apoptosis in animals is needed to ensure the continued health and wellbeing of crew members during long-term space missions. Indeed, dysbiosis is a well-known consequence of spaceflight and there is compelling evidence to suggest that disruptions in an animal’s normal, healthy, microbiome may be related to dysfunctional apoptotic cell death in microgravity [11, 12]. Altered proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the gastrointestinal tract of mice have been associated with reduced apoptosis among colonic epithelial cells in modeled microgravity, thus hindering tissue turnover [13]. Simulated weightlessness has also been shown to induce apoptotic damage in the intestinal mucosal barrier of rats, which is paralleled by compositional changes in the gut microbiome [14]. To address these issues, the monospecific mutualism between the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio fischeri has emerged as a tractable model system to study the impact of reduced gravity on bacteria-induced changes to host physiology, including apoptosis [15, 16]. V. fischeri colonizes a specialized light organ (Fig. 1a-c) in the host squid and produces luminescence that the squid uses at night to conceal its shadow from predators [17]. Shortly after E. scolopes hatch, V. fischeri are entrained from the surrounding seawater via ciliated epithelial appendages (CEA) that border each lobe of the nascent light organ (Fig. 1b), and in so doing, potentiate colonization. Shortly thereafter, microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) molecules, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tracheal cytotoxin, induce a post-embryonic remodeling event during which apoptosis is widely induced throughout the light organ’s ciliated fields (Fig. 1c), peaking at 16 h [18–20]. Subsequently, in the days following colonization, these structures completely regress [21] and the light organ undergoes further maturation [22]. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Overview of the host Euprymna scolopes, experimental setup, and developmental timeline under different gravitational treatments. a Image of E. scolopes paralarvae at the time of hatching.

Light organs stained with acridine orange at the time of hatching (lower left) and during the peak of bacteria-induced apoptosis at 16 h (lower right) show punctate nuclei demarking apoptotic cell death only in those cells exposed to V. fischeri. c High aspect ratio vessels positioned in the modeled microgravity treatment (left) and gravity (right) control positions. d Comparative timeline demonstrating the shift in bacteria-induced apoptosis between gravity and modeled microgravity conditions. The onset and peak of bacteria-induced apoptosis is accelerated in low shear modeled microgravity conditions (LSMMG)To simulate microgravity, high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) have been successfully used with the squid-vibrio symbiosis to generate a low sheared modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment (Fig. 1c) [15, 16, 23, 24]. Briefly, rotation about a horizontal axis offsets gravitational settling such that the contents of each reactor are maintained in a state of constant suspension under low shear conditions that emulate the quiescent fluid dynamics of low Earth orbit (Fig. 1c). Rotation about a vertical axis, by contrast, allows for sedimentation to occur unperturbed and thus serves as the unit Earth gravity controls (Fig. 1c) [25]. The LSMMG environment produced by this ground-based analog has been used for decades to model microgravity, and results obtained with the HARVs have been shown to parallel the findings of many spaceflight studies [25, 26]. Previously, studies using the squid-vibrio model in LSMMG revealed that the bacteria-induced development of the light organ is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions (Fig. 1d) [15], however, the mechanisms by which these changes occur are unknown. In this study, we characterize several aspects of the apoptosis genetic machinery in the host squid, examine the differential expression of several of these apoptosis-related genes, and assess the activity and mitigation potential of several initiator and executioner caspases associated with apoptosis under modeled microgravity conditions. The outcomes provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying apoptotic dysregulation in response to microgravity-like stress and its potential impact on the physiology of animals and beneficial microbes during spaceflight.Results Identification of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis network within the host Euprymna scolopes To elucidate the apoptosis machinery in the bobtail squid, a detailed map of the putative pathways for apoptosis in the squid host was generated by data-mining the reference transcriptome and genome of E. scolopes (Fig. 2). This search identified 293 transcripts, representing 137 unique genes, involved in the regulation of apoptosis in the host squid (Table S1; Fig. S1). The resultant network revealed an elaborate web of parallel and hierarchical interactions and pro-and anti-apoptotic effectors that appear to govern extrinsic, receptor-mediated, and intrinsic, stress-induced cell death via transcriptional, translational, and post-translational means (Fig. 2). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Putative pathways for apoptosis in Euprymna scolopes. The candidates identified from the genome and reference transcriptome included effectors of both extrinsic/receptor-mediated, and intrinsic/stress-associated, apoptosis. Representative interactions were mapped by cross referencing the multi-species KEGG pathway for apoptosis (ko04215) with peer-reviewed literatureFor the extrinsic apoptosis network, two tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily members (Tnfrsf11, Tnfrsf21) and five Tnf-associated factors (Traf 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7) were discovered in E. scolopes (Fig. 2, Table S1). The closely related initiator caspases-8 and -10 were also identified, as well as death domain-associated adaptors Fadd, Daxx, and the stress-associated kinase Ripk1. Interestingly, neither Fas ligand nor its corresponding receptor was found in the reference transcriptome despite the presence of components known to operate downstream (e.g., Fadd). Nevertheless, E. scolopes was determined to harbor all the effectors required to assemble a complete death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) for extrinsic, receptor-mediated apoptosis, which serves as the activation assembly for extrinsic initiator caspases-10 and -8 [27]. Additionally, transcripts associated with three LPS-binding proteins (Lbps) and the LPS-induced transcription factor, Litaf, which have been previously described in E. scolopes [28] were also observed in the putative extrinsic, receptor-mediated network (Fig. 2). With regards to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, transcripts encoding both pro-apoptotic (Bnip3, Bcl10, Bcl2L13, Bax, Bak) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl2L1, Mcl1, Ar1) members of the Bcl2 protein family were found in E. scolopes (Fig. 2; Table S1). A variety of mitochondrial proteins (i.e., Aifm1, Aifm3, Diablo, Cytc, Htra2) were identified as well as Apaf1 and the intrinsic initiator caspase-9. Thus, all the requisite parts of the apoptosome, which is the activation complex of the stress-induced pathway for cell death were found in the bobtail squid (Fig. 2). However, the Bh3-only protein Bid, which typically represents a critical junction for crosstalk between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways for apoptosis in animals, was conspicuously absent. Likewise, the presence of atypical initiator caspase-2 was confirmed along with Pidd1, both of which are constituents of the pro-death, p53-inducible, PIDDosome complex that forms in response to DNA damage [29]; however, no evidence of the third member of this assembly, Raidd/Cradd, was found in the bobtail squid reference transcriptome or genome. In addition to Bcl2-type repressors, transcripts encoding numerous inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (Iaps) were discovered in the host squid. Included among these were Xiap, Diap2, three Baculoviral Iap-repeat containing proteins (Birc7b, Birc3, and Birc6), three Bcl2-associated athanogene regulators (Bag 1, 4, and 6), cell death regulator Aven, the peptidyl isomerase Pin1, as well as heat shock proteins Hsp90 and Hsp7c (Table S1). Further examination revealed the presence of numerous cathepsin (B, K, L, L1, L2, Z) and calpain (1–3, 5, 7–9, 11, B, D) proteases, several of which have been previously reported in E. scolopes [30]. The cathepsins recovered from the reference transcriptome were primarily cysteine-dependent, except for cathepsin B, which is a serine protease. Intriguingly, neither aspartic acid-type cathepsins (D and E) were found in the host squid. Analysis of the E. scolopes reference transcriptome revealed a variety of nucleus-localizing proteins affiliated with apoptosis (Table S1). Broadly, this included transcription factors (i.e., Aatf, Atf4, Jun, E2f, Hox, Irf, Litaf, NF-κB, p73), p53-type transactivators (i.e., Aspp1, Ccar1), and apoptotic mediators of chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (i.e., Acin1, Dffb/Cad, EndoG) (Table S1). Transcripts encoding numerous regulators of apoptotic translation were likewise present in the squid, most notably the eukaryotic initiation factors Eif2, Eif3f, Eif3j, Eif4b, and Eif4e (Table S1). Interestingly, however, no transactivating factors of internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated translation were present in the transcriptome of E. scolopes, and the nuclear lamin protease and executioner caspase, caspase-6, was not observed.Extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression under LSMMG conditions To ascertain the impact of modeled microgravity on the light organ cell death event in the host animal, 41 apoptosis-related genes identified in the reference transcriptome were selected for gene expression analysis using the NanoString nCounter assay (Table 1). These target genes were representative of key components of the apoptosis machinery depicted in Fig. 2. The expression of these target transcripts was quantified over time in hatchling paralarvae incubated within the HARVs under LSMMG and gravity control conditions in the presence and absence of the symbiotic bacterium V. fischeri ES114. Overall, the NanoString results indicated that there was an increase in the transcription of genes associated with both receptor-mediated and stress-induced apoptosis under LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls (Fig. 3, 4).

Per the color scale, red indicates a negative Z-score and lower-than-average expression, whereas green signifies a positive Z-score and higher-than-average expressionWith regards to effectors of extrinsic, receptor-mediated, apoptosis, the LPS binding proteins 1 and 3, along with the endotoxin-induced transcription factor Litaf were significantly up-expressed in modeled microgravity between 6 and 10 h post-hatching (Fig. 3). Likewise, transcripts encoding the adaptor protein Fadd were more abundant during the early hours of development in LSMMG; however, these results were not statistically significant from the gravity controls (Fig. 3). A similar trend was observed in the NanoString results for genes affiliated with intrinsic, stress-induced apoptosis. The Bh3-only protein Bnip3, membrane permeabilizer Bak, Diablo, and caspase-dependent Aifm3 were significantly up expressed in LSMMG between 8 and 12 h compared to gravity controls (Fig. 3). Bnip3, which overcomes Bcl-2 type suppression of pro-death effectors Bax/Bak, increased overtime under LSMMG peaking at 16 and 18 h in LSMMG compared to the unit gravity controls (Fig. 3). Bnip3 is known to be induced under hypoxic conditions, however, measurements of the dissolved oxygen content were consistent across all treatments at 24 h revealing no difference in oxygen availability in the HARVs (Fig. S2).Expression of pro-death caspases in host animal under LSMMG conditions The identification of caspase-2, -3, -7, -8, -9, and -10 transcripts in the reference transcriptome suggested the presence of canonical pathways for extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis in E. scolopes (Fig. 4). Additionally, caspase-driven apoptosis has a known role in the bacteria-induced development of the light organ, given that treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK has been shown to reduce the number of dying cells observed at 24 h post-inoculation [30]. These results suggested that caspase regulation, either at the level of mRNA and/or protein, was a contributing factor to the accelerated developmental timeline of apoptosis in the host light organ under LSMMG conditions (Fig. 1d). NanoString analysis was used to examine the differential gene expression of the putative initiator (i.e., casp2, casp8, casp9, and casp10) and executioner (i.e., casp3) caspase genes in symbiotic and aposymbiotic squid under microgravity and gravity conditions. Results revealed that under LSMMG conditions there was a pronounced increase in the pro-death caspase transcripts between 6 and 10 h post-colonization by V. fischeri (Fig. 4), which aligns with early-onset apoptosis previously observed in paralarvae squid exposed to modeled microgravity [15]. Aposymbiotic control animals that were not exposed to V. fischeri showed no differential expression under LSMMG or gravity conditions at these same time points (Fig. S3).The architecture of caspase domain structure in Euprymna scolopes To evaluate the extent of similarity between the E. scolopes caspase (EsCasp) enzymes and homologs in other animals, the domain architecture of EsCasps was mapped and compared to sequences derived from Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Danio rerio, and Xenopus laevis (Fig. 5). Additionally, the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and the East Asian octopus, Octopus sinensis, were included in the analysis to distinguish lineage-specific modifications within the Mollusca phylum and/or among cephalopods (Fig. 5, Additional File 3). Domain analysis via SMART, InterProScan, and the  Conserved Domain Database, as described in the Methods, revealed that the architecture of caspases-2, -3, -7, -8, and -9 in E. scolopes is largely consistent with that of other animals, including both vertebrates and invertebrates alike (Fig. 5). Typically, the EsCasps ranged from 327 to 634 residues in length and weighed between 41.4 and 72.1 kDa (Table 2). The main exception to this was EsCasp10_2X, which was only 297 amino acids long and had a molecular weight of 34.4 kDa (Table 2). Fig. 5.

For example, the extrinsic initiator caspase-8 of E. scolopes (EsCasp8) exhibited dual twin death effector domains (DED) at the N-terminus, which is characteristic of both vertebrates and invertebrate caspase-8 proteins; however, this dual DED domain was missing in the initiator EsCasp10 isoforms when compared to vertebrates H. sapiens, D. rerio, and X. laevis (Fig. 5). EsCasp10 did harbor a singular caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), suggesting a potential misannotation. The CARD domain was also observed in EsCasp2 and -9 initiator caspases, which is typical of most vertebrates and invertebrates (Fig. 5). Interestingly, caspase-9 in M. galloprovincialis (MgCasp9) exhibited dual DED in place of the traditional CARD, suggesting a potential misannotation of this protein in M. galloprovincialis. In all sequences examined, a carboxyl-terminal catalytic (CASc) domain was present (Fig. 5, yellow box). The CASc is a 45 kDa precursor that is cleaved during activation to yield the p20 and p10 subunits. Intriguingly, despite the presence of a complete CASc, analysis of EsCasp2_2x and EsCasp9 revealed the smaller p10 subunit was not detected in these two isoforms. Executioner caspases-3 and -7 in animals typically lack pro-domains and are therefore shorter as a result (Fig. 5). The executioner caspases of E. scolopes (EsCasp3 and -7) varied from 213 to 370 residues in length and had a molecular weight ranging from 23.9 to 41.5 kDa (Table 2; Table S2), thus were comparable to both the vertebrate and invertebrate species targeted in this analysis. Most EsCasp3 and -7 isoforms exhibited a conserved QACRG pentapeptide in the catalytic region or equivalent (Table 2).Phylogenetic analysis of host squid caspases Maximum likelihood analysis of the initiator caspases revealed two distinctive clusters primarily consisting of caspases-8, -9 and -10, and caspase-2, respectively (Fig. 6a), that were reflective of the function of whether the initiator caspases were activated by extrinsic or intrinsic triggers. EsCasp8 clustered with all other caspase-8 proteases sourced from  but was closest to proteases from O. sinensis. Similarly, EsCasp2 also branched closely with both invertebrate and vertebrate caspase-2 initiators. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the caspase enzymes in E. scolopes, H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, D. rerio, X. laevis, M. galloprovincialis, and O. sinensis. a Unrooted phylogenetic tree for initiator caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10. b Unrooted phylogenetic tree for executioner caspase-3 and -7. Both trees were generated assuming the WAG model of amino acid substitution, with 1000 bootstrap iterations, in MEGA X. Branch support values are expressed as percentages. Sequences are labeled with the first letter of the corresponding genus and species (e.g., Euprymna scolopes, Es)Unexpectedly, EsCasp9 clustered with the two sequences that were likely misannotated as isoforms of caspase-10. Although the monophyly of the group is indeterminate due to the low outer branch support value (42%), these sequences share several distinguishing features that suggest they may represent a group of caspase-9-like initiators that is specific to Euprymna (Fig. 6a). First, the domain organization of EsCasp9, EsCasp10_1X, and EsCasp10_2X emulates that of canonical caspases -2 and -9, with an N-terminal CARD domain and a C-terminal CASc region (Fig. 5). Second, although the sequences of this group exhibit 94 to 95% identity with one another, their percent identity scores with the other initiator caspases are very low, between 15 and 29%, which indicates they may have distinct structural features (Fig. S4). Third, EsCasp9, EsCasp10_1X, and EsCasp10_2X all exhibit a conserved “QACQP” catalytic pentapeptide (Table 2). Caspases, uniformly, possess a QACXG motif in the active site, with the middle position specifying the catalytic cysteine residue [31]. Given its crucial importance to the protease activity of caspases, variations within this pentapeptide are limited and may denote similar functions. The maximum likelihood estimation of executioner caspases formed two several distinctive groups primarily separated into vertebrate and invertebrate clusters (Fig. 6b). For example, the vertebrate caspases-7 and -3 from H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, D. rerio, and X. laevis formed distinctive groupings, that excluded most of the molluscan isoforms. Interestingly, two caspase-7 isoforms from E. scolopes (EsCasp7_2X and EsCasp7_4X) had a higher association with the vertebrate executioner caspases than the other molluscan orthologs for caspase-3 and -7 (Fig. 6b). This phylogeny may allude to a greater degree of differentiation, or perhaps expansion, among the executioner caspases of the squid, which has previously been documented in bivalves [32, 33]. However, the percent identity among the executioners was 47% which makes it difficult to discern whether these sequences represent isoforms of the same gene(s) or an expansion of caspases-3 and -7 in E. scolopes (Fig. S4). Overall, there appeared to be a relatively high degree of similarity among the executioner caspases of E. scolopes. However, the close affiliation of EsCasp7_2X and EsCasp7_4X with vertebral orthologs suggests the presence of at least two distinct executioner-type caspases in the squid. Unsurprisingly, both the initiator and executioner caspases of E. scolopes were most closely related to O. sinensis, and to a lesser extent, M. galloprovincialis, which is consistent with their categorization as both soft-bodied cephalopods and, more broadly, mollusks.Caspase activity and mitigation during the onset of symbiosis and light organ morphogenesis under LSMMG and gravity conditions The activities of executioner caspases-3/7, extrinsic initiator caspase-8, and intrinsic initiator caspase-9 were quantified in host animals in the presence and absence of the symbiont V. fischeri using Caspase Glo activity kits. Note, due to the similar mechanisms of activity, the kits could not resolve between caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities. All caspases tested were significantly more active in symbiotic animals at 16 h post-colonization, the peak of cell death [19], compared to 16 h aposymbiotic controls and newly hatched paralarvae (Fig. 7). In all three treatments, there was a 26-fold increase in executioner caspase activity (Fig. 7a) compared to the extrinsic and intrinsic initiators (Fig. 7b, c). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Caspase activity and protease inhibition during bacteria-induced apoptosis in the normal squid-vibrio symbiosis. The activity of a executioner caspase-3/-7, b extrinsic initiator caspase-8, and c intrinsic initiator caspase-9 was measured in the light organs of hatchling, 16 h aposymbiotic (apo), and 16 h symbiotic (sym) squid. d Apoptosis was quantified at 16 h after protease inhibitor treatment including pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (ZVAD), the caspase 8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO (C8i), caspase 9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CMK (C9i), Pefabloc (Pefa) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) controls. Error bars are the standard error of the mean. Asterisks denote significant differences between the datasets test (* = p ≤ 0.05, ** = p ≤ 0.01). Comparisons that were not significant are labeled “ns”To test whether the caspases could be inhibited in the host animals, pre-treatment with inhibitors targeting different caspases was used. Treatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, and the serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc for two hours prior to the start of the symbiosis significantly reduced apoptotic cell levels at 16 h in symbiotic hatchlings compared to untreated symbiotic controls but did not completely inhibit apoptosis (Fig. 7d). Interestingly, although the Caspase-Glo assays indicated caspase-9 was active during the apex of cell death (Fig. 7c), treatment with the caspase-9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CMK did not reduce the level of pycnotic nuclei observed at 16 h relative to the untreated or DMSO-treated controls (Fig. d). Additionally, the coupling of different inhibitors showed no additive effects (Fig. 7d). The colonization of the host squid did not appear to be affected as symbiotic animals exhibited normal luminescence levels throughout the experimental treatments. To elucidate the effects of LSMMG stress on caspase activity, 10 h symbiotic animals were examined with Caspase Glo activity kits (Fig. 8). This time point was chosen as it coincided with the higher expression of caspase transcripts in LSMMG (Fig. 4). Results indicated that LSMMG-treated animals exhibited higher levels of caspase-3/7 and caspase-8 activity compared to gravity conditions in symbiotic animals (Fig. 8a, b). Interestingly, no differences were observed in caspase-9 activity in symbiotic animals incubated under LSMMG or gravity conditions, (Fig. 8c). Executioner activity was observed to be several orders of magnitude higher than both initiator caspases, exhibiting up to a 32-fold increase compared to the initiator caspases in both aposymbiotic and symbiotic animals (Fig. 8a-c). Treatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, and the serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc abrogated the significant increase in light organ apoptosis observed at 10 h in LSMMG in symbiotic animals (Fig. 8d).

Comparisons that were not significant are labeled “ns”Discussion As humans prepare for space exploration beyond low Earth orbit, it will be critical to fully understand the impact that spaceflight has on mutualistic animal-microbe interactions. Maintaining a healthy microbiome during long-duration spaceflights will require a comprehensive assessment of the effects that environmental stresses, such as microgravity, have on the bacteria-induced development of host tissues [12, 34]. To address this key issue in space biology, we examined the effects of simulated microgravity on the beneficial association between Euprymna scolopes and Vibrio fischeri, specifically focusing on the phenomenon of bacteria-induced apoptosis in the light organ of the squid host. The outcomes of this study indicated that (i) E. scolopes harbors a rich network of genes involved in both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic regulation; (ii) the presence of symbiotic bacteria and LSMMG-stress altered the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression; (iii) the normal, bacteria-induced apoptosis in the squid light organ is mediated in part by caspases that exhibit increased activity under LSMMG; and (iv) the LSMMG-associated increase of caspase activity can be pharmacologically mitigated with inhibitors. Apoptosis is a critical pathway for animal development playing key roles in tissue homeostasis, antimicrobial defense as well as innate and adaptive immune responses [35, 36]. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to discern the effects of the microbiome on apoptosis [37, 38] and how this vital form of physiological cell death is altered by microgravity [13, 39]. Although E. scolopes has served as a model organism for decades, the pathways by which the symbiont V. fischeri induces apoptotic cell death have not been fully delineated with only a few effectors identified [28, 40–42]. The recent sequencing of the E. scolopes genome and reference transcriptome has enabled critical animal pathways, including apoptosis, to be investigated [43]. Analyses revealed that E. scolopes harbors genes associated with both primary pathways for cell death that are typically seen in animals, including death-receptor mediated extrinsic pathways as well as intracellular stress-induced intrinsic pathways (Fig. 2; Fig. S1; Additional File 1). Results also suggest that E. scolopes may form distinct caspase activation platforms, particularly regarding the extrinsic, receptor-mediated, pathway. For example, the absence of Cradd in E. scolopes, as well as in the octopus genome, suggests that cephalopod caspase-2 exerts its pro-apoptotic effects outside the PIDDosome complex, likely in association with Tnf receptor signaling [44, 45]. Intriguingly, for 15 apoptosis candidates in the reference transcriptome of E. scolopes, no proteins of significant similarity were found in the SwissProt database via BLASTx or BLASTp (Additional File 1). These queries were initially identified based on possessing a CARD- or DED-domain and preliminary BLASTp analysis using non-redundant  database returned mostly uncharacterized and predicted caspase-interacting protein in other cephalopods. Accordingly, these unknown candidates may represent novel apoptotic effectors within the Mollusca phylum. In general, cephalopods appear to possess a more expansive vertebrate-like repertoire of intrinsic apoptosis genes than other mollusks, including Bnip3, Bax, Apaf1, Htra2, and Pidd [32, 46, 47]. These results suggest that apoptosis has undergone substantial lineage-specific modifications within the Mollusca phylum, which may have resulted in distinct mechanisms of induction. For example, caspase-9 proteins have been described in the mussel M. galloprovincialis despite the lack of Apaf1, which is a critical component of the apoptosome complex in other animals [33, 47]. Under the stress of LSMMG conditions, however, there was an acceleration and increased expression of the transcripts associated with bacteria-induced apoptosis genes in symbiotic animals, specifically related to extrinsic, receptor-mediated cell death (Fig. 3). The increased transcriptional response in symbiotic animals was primarily observed among PRR elements for LPS, including LPS-binding proteins Lbp1 and Lbp3, as well as the LPS-induced transcription factor Litaf (Fig. 3). Elevated concentrations of Lbps have been observed in blood plasma of astronauts returning from shuttle missions, as well as the sera of mice following two days of hindlimb suspension [48, 49]. In E. scolopes, however, previous work has demonstrated that Lbps1 exhibits a symbiosis-specific function and contributes to bacteria-induced apoptosis in the light organ of E. scolopes [28]. Little is known about the functions of Lbp2 and Lbp3 in E. scolopes and the precise mechanisms by which symbiotic paralarvae identify LPS remain unclear [50]. However, mammalian Lbps facilitate the receptor-based recognition of gram-negative endotoxin [28], which raises the possibility that the Lbps of E. scolopes may be responsible for the delivery of symbiont LPS to death receptors on target host cells, thereby promoting extrinsic apoptosis throughout the ciliated epithelium of the light organ. Additionally, previous studies have shown that LSMMG can increase the shedding of reactogenic LPS by V. fischeri [16], thus the combined increase in available MAMP shedding coupled with the increased expression of Lbp1 and Lbp3 receptors in LSMMG may facilitate the accelerated extrinsic apoptosis response in the symbiotic animals under modeled microgravity conditions. In symbiotic hatchlings, the expression of genes associated with intrinsic, stress-induced, cell death was also increased under LSMMG conditions, specifically within the window of 10 to 12 h post-bacterial colonization (Fig. 3). This increase included the Bh3-only protein Bnip3, the membrane permeabilizer Bak, as well as the mitochondrial proteins Diablo and Aifm3 (Fig. 3). Previous studies with space shuttle-flown murine embryonic stem cells have also shown a similar up-regulation of intrinsic apoptosis-associated genes, including Bnip3 [51]. Bh3-only proteins are the sentinels of stress-induced apoptosis and form the molecular basis of crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Bnip3 expression is known to be induced by hypoxia-dependent signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS), both of which are elements of oxidative stress [52, 53]. Although no evidence of hypoxia was observed in the HARVs during the experimental conditions (Fig. S2), reactive oxygen and nitric oxide stress are critical components during the onset of the squid-vibrio symbiosis [54, 55]. Indeed, the phenomenon of spaceflight and microgravity-induced oxidative stress has been extensively documented in astronauts and many other model organisms and cell lines [23, 56, 57]. Consequently, the up expression of Bnip3, Bak, Diablo, and Aifm3 implies that modeled microgravity-derived oxidative stress may compound the normal, bacteria-induced, development of the light organ in E. scolopes via atypical stimulation of the intrinsic pathway. The results also indicated that the expression of pro-death caspases was increased in symbiotic animals under modeled microgravity. Caspases are cysteine-dependent proteases that are widely regarded as the “core machinery” of apoptosis and are responsible for mediating the initiation and fallout associated with most known pathways for cell death [58]. This study found that both initiator and executioner-type caspases were up-expressed during accelerated light organ apoptosis in modeled microgravity-treated symbiotic hatchlings compared to gravity controls (Fig. 4). The detection of functional caspase enzymes in aposymbiotic controls in the absence of apoptotic cells in the light organ suggests that there is a critical execution threshold for cascade activation. Thus, it appears that the superficial ciliated epithelial cells of E. scolopes light organ are “primed” for morphogenesis via baseline levels of initiator and executioner caspase activity that are maintained below the activation threshold for apoptosis until the symbiotic cues for development, such as LPS, are received. In symbiotic hatchlings, the increase of transcripts encoding pro-death caspases under LSMMG conditions coincided with the early onset and premature peak of developmental cell death (i.e., 6 – 10 h post inoculation) previously observed in the squid [15]. Notably, the amount of initiator caspase has been shown to positively correlate with the extent of downstream executioner activation, and to irreversibly induce apoptosis a certain threshold of activity must be surpassed [59]. These results suggest that the increased caspase expression in LSMMG may lower the activation threshold of light organ apoptosis due to the increased availability of proenzymes, which closely parallels previous reports that the concentrations of pro-caspases-9 and -3 are key predictors of apoptotic susceptibility [60]. The initiators and executioners of E. scolopes exhibited a high degree of structural similarity to the orthologs of other animals in particular initiators EsCasp2 and EsCasp8 as well as executioners EsCasp3 and EsCasp7 [61, 62]. However, anomalies were observed in both isoforms of squid caspase-10, which contained a single CARD at the N-terminus rather than a dual DED (Fig. 5). This significant deviation from the structural norm indicates that the EsCasp10 sequences were likely misannotated, given that their structure more closely resembles that of initiator caspases-2 and -9 [63]. Additionally, there were deviations in the CASc precursor domain of several caspase isoforms in the host squid, such as EsCasp2_2X and EsCasp9, where the smaller p10 subunit was not observed (Fig. 5). In animals, the primary sequence of the p10 subunit is subject to greater variation than the larger p20 due to the absence of catalytic cysteine and histidine residues, which may have precluded its detection in EsCasp2_2X and EsCasp9. Given that an intact CASc region was identified within these isoforms it is like these two isoforms are functional despite the inability to identify the p10 subunits within the CASC precursor domain. Maximum likelihood analysis demonstrated that the initiator caspases of E. scolopes, H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, D. rerio, X. laevis, M. galloprovincialis, and O. sinensis clustered primarily based on like orthologs (Fig. 6). The segregation of initiators into three groups bearing high identity to caspases-8 and -10, -9, and -2 is largely consistent with previous phylogenetic analyses that illustrated further subdivisions between the vertebrates and invertebrates [32, 33]. The exclusion of E. scolopes and M. galloprovincialis from the subclade of vertebral caspase-9 orthologs, along with their placement on opposing branches of the unrooted phylogenetic tree next to same-species sequences, implies that lineage-specific variations have occurred in the intrinsic initiator caspases of mollusks (Fig. 6). The increased activity of all tested caspases in symbiotic animals relative to aposymbiotic controls suggests both receptor-mediated and stress-induced apoptosis pathways occurring in the bacteria-induced development of the host light organ (Fig. 7). However, inhibition of caspases under unit gravity resulted in a decrease of only 50% of apoptotic pycnotic nuclei, suggesting that the normal V. fischeri-induced apoptosis pathways in the light organ of E. scolopes are partially, but not entirely, caspase-dependent. These results align with the previous finding that cathepsin L – a lysosomal, cysteine-dependent protease – also contributes to developmental cell death in symbiotic paralarvae [30], suggesting apoptosis in the host animals is mediated by a multi-faceted array of apoptosis-associated proteases that are triggered by both external and intrinsic signals. Under the stress of LSMMG, however, our findings suggest that the increase in apoptotic cell death levels in symbiotic light organs is mediated primarily through caspase activation via the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The phenotype of increased apoptotic nuclei in the light organ under LSMMG was mitigated using caspase inhibitors, producing statistically equivalent numbers of pycnotic nuclei compared to unit gravity controls (Fig. 8d). These increases in caspase activity complement our previous findings that GO terms related to enzymatic activity and catalysis were disproportionately enriched in LSMMG-treated paralarvae at 12 and 24 h compared to gravity controls [23]. These data also parallel previous studies that showed spaceflight and modeled microgravity-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes and erythrocytes was significantly reduced by caspase inhibition [64, 65]. Although most initiator and executioner caspases were up expressed in LSMMG conditions, not all were pharmacologically inhibited. Interestingly, treatment with the Ac-LEHD-CMK caspase-9 inhibitor did not produce a significant reduction in the amount of apoptosis observed under gravity conditions in symbiotic animals (Fig. 7d). Additionally, no LSMMG-induced increase was observed in the caspase-9 activity, despite the increase in transcript levels at 10 h (Fig. 4; Fig. 8). Given that the recognition peptide of the caspase-9 inhibitor is identical to that of the Caspase-Glo substrate (LEHD-CMK), it is unlikely that this phenomenon derives from differences in binding affinity or substrate specificity with the caspase-9 of E. scolopes. Caspase-9 has traditionally been considered an upstream caspase that depends on the binding to the CARD motif Apaf-1 apoptosome for activation [46] and is the first caspase of the ROS-regulated mitochondrial apoptotic cascade [66]. Thus, these results suggest there could be alternative pathways for the onset of executioner caspases in the host squid other than caspase-9-dependent pathways. For example, apoptosis can be activated through apoptosome-independent mechanisms [67], thus more research is needed to understand the role of caspase-9 under both gravity and LSMMG conditions.Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that external stresses, such as modeled microgravity, can cause perturbations to the normal apoptotic pathways in animals. As many of the mechanisms that E. scolopes use to communicate with V. fischeri are present in other animals (e.g., Lbps) this research provides a framework for understanding how animals respond differentially to the stresses of spaceflight in the presence and absence of their symbionts. For spaceflight, understanding how disruptions in host-microbe homeostasis and animal physiology alter normal physiological responses, such as apoptosis, is critical. Furthermore, the ability to modulate the life or death of a cell as well as identify mitigation targets or strategies to prevent perturbations of animal-microbe homeostasis has immense therapeutic potential for maintaining crew health for long-duration spaceflight.Methods General procedures Adult E. scolopes were collected from Maunalua Bay on O’ahu, Hawai’I, and transported to the Space Life Sciences Lab where they were maintained in a controlled growth chamber set at 23 °C on a 12 h light–dark cycle. Egg clutches laid by the female squid were incubated in separate aquaria from the adults for the entirety of paralarvae development (~ 21 days). Newly hatched paralarvae were rinsed twice in 0.22 μm filtered seawater (FSW), then either preserved in an aposymbiotic state (i.e., without V. fischeri) or rendered symbiotic by inoculation with the wild-type, strain ES114, to a final concentration of 105 cells per mL of FSW. For all experiments, colonization was confirmed by measuring luminescence with an ATP photometer (GloMax 20/20, Promega Corp., Madison, WI). For symbiotic experiments, log cultures of V. fischeri were prepared in seawater tryptone broth [68] and incubated at 28˚C with 225 rpm shaking. For all experiments, animals were anesthetized and euthanized before examination in a 1:1 solution of 0.37 M MgCl2 and filtered sterilized seawater. Euthanasia by over anesthesia is the current accepted practice for cephalopods [69, 70].Replicates, data treatment, and statistical analyses All experiments were performed in triplicate, with at least three biological and technical replicates unless otherwise noted. Outliers identified via the 1.5 × interquartile range (IQR) method were removed before analysis, and data normality was assessed via Shapiro–Wilk (SW). Statistical significance was evaluated either using a Welch’s t-test (SW p > 0.05) for parametric data or Mann–Whitney-Wilcoxon U test when the data were not normally distributed (SW p ≤ 0.05). Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were two-sided and used a significance cut-off of p ≤ 0.05.Modeled microgravity treatments and DO2 readings To mimic the low-shear fluid conditions of spaceflight, 50-mL High Aspect Ratio Vessels (Fig. 1c; HARVs; Synthecon, Houston, TX) were used as previously described [15]. Briefly, for aposymbiotic conditions, the HARVs were filled with FSW, whereas for symbiotic conditions HARVs contained 105 cells of V. fischeri ES114 per mL of FSW. After animals were added to the HARVs, the reactors were then sealed to prevent the formation of bubbles and incubated at 23 °C in a synchronized LED-illuminated Percival incubator (Percival Scientific Inc., Perry, IA) with rotation at 13 rpm. The HARVs were either rotated around a vertical axis to control for unit gravity (Fig. 1c left) or were rotated around a horizontal axis to mimic microgravity conditions (Fig. 1c right). The dissolved oxygen content (DO2) of the FSW collected from the HARVs was also measured at 24 h with a hand-held probe (Sper Scientific, Scottsdale, AZ) in a minimum of three replicates. For control purposes, and to establish a baseline for enzyme assays and inhibitor treatments, a cohort of hatchling animals were incubated in borosilicate scintillation vials alongside the HARV reactors until 16 h post-hatching, which marks the peak of developmental cell death in normal gravity [18]. For all treatments, at least one animal from each treatment was put aside to confirm colonization and/or quantify light organ apoptosis. The remaining squid were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen or dry ice and stored at – 80 °C until downstream analysis.RNA isolation, quantification, and quality assessment For each treatment, RNA was extracted from three dissected light organs in triplicate and pooled using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the previously described modifications [23]. The resultant RNA was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and assessments of quality were made using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) with the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). For the nCounter analysis, the RNA samples were diluted to a final concentration of 20 ng per mL of nuclease-free water and stored at – 80 °C.Transcriptome analysis and NanoString nCounter Preliminary gene selection was made by data-mining the reference transcriptome of E. scolopes [43] for apoptosis-related KEGG identifiers, GO terms, Pfam accession numbers, and SwissProt annotations (Additional File 1). Target genes were selected for further study by cross-referencing the multi-species KEGG pathway for apoptosis (ko04215) with published analyses in other cephalopods. The selected genes (Table 1; Additional File 2) represent those target genes where probes could be designed. Some apoptosis genes within E. scolopes had numerous isoforms and this not all probes were effective. Three LPS-binding proteins (LBPs) from E. scolopes were also included in the final apoposis-gene CodeSet (Table 1), along with the housekeeping genes actin (actB) and pyruvate carboxylase (pyc1). Probes to the selected target genes were synthesized at NanoString Technologies, Inc. in Seattle, WA. Each assay included eight negative control probes to evaluate the non-specific background and six synthetic RNA targets with matching positive control probes.NanoString quality control, data processing, and differential analysis The raw NanoString counts from the nCounter assay were processed using nSolver software (ver 4.0) as previously described [71]. Quality control was conducted based on imaging quality, probe binding density, positive control linearity, and the limit of detection as established by the negative controls. Non-specific background signal was subtracted, and the data were normalized to the internal controls and housekeeping genes to adjust between technical and biological replicates. Next, the data were imported into R Studio (ver 1.2.1335) and a Shapiro–Wilk test was performed to determine data normality. Afterwards, a LIMMA-voom transformation was applied and the output – expressed as log2 counts-per-million (log2CPM) – was used to fit a linear regression model. Finally, the differential expression analysis was computed for pair-wise comparisons using non-parametric empirical Bayes statistics with a Benjamin-Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing (Additional File 2).Phylogenetic and architectural analysis of caspase enzymes Caspase protein sequences were obtained from the reference transcriptome for Euprymna scolopes [43]. Homologous sequences were similarly sourced from the National Center Biotechnology Information () for other common research organisms (Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Xenopus laevis, Danio rerio) as well as two species (Mytilus galloprovinciali, and Octopus sinensis) within the Mollusca phylum (Additional File 3). To compare initiator and executioner caspases, a multiple sequence alignment was generated via MUSCLE (ver 3.8.31) according to the default parameters [72]. Maximum likelihood analysis was then performed using MEGA X software (ver 10.2.1) assuming the Whelan-Goldman model of amino acid substitution with 1000 bootstrap iterations [73]. The resultant phylogenetic trees were rendered in MEGA X, with branch support values expressed as percentages on the unrooted trees. Separately, the domain architecture of each caspase sequence was analyzed via SMART, InterProScan, and the  Conserved Domain Search [74–76]. Estimates of protein isoelectric point and molecular weight were calculated using the ExPASy Compute pI/Mw tool (Table 2) [77]. The percent identities of the initiator and executioner caspases in E. scolopes were determined via Clustal Omega at the default parameters [78].Light organ protein isolation and quantification To examine enzyme activity during light organ apoptosis, total protein was isolated from frozen animals. Per extraction, approximately 60 light organs were dissected into an ice-cold hypotonic extraction buffer containing 24 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.4) supplemented with a custom protease inhibitor cocktail to a final concentration of 2 μg pepstatin, 5 μg aprotinin, 5 μg leupeptin, and 100 μg Pefabloc per mL of buffer. The light organs were then homogenized on ice with a ground-glass micromortar and pestle, and the exudate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet out debris. The amount of protein in the supernatant was subsequently determined using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Afterwards, the protein extract was diluted with ice-cold extraction buffer and 5 M NaCl to a final concentration of 1 mg of protein and 0.45 M NaCl per mL of buffer. All protein extracts were stored at – 80 °C until use. For each treatment, protein extractions were performed in triplicate.Caspase activity assays To quantify caspase activity in the light organ, Caspase-Glo Assay kits (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, equal volumes of pre-warmed Caspase-Glo reagent and light organ protein were combined in a white-walled, flat-bottomed, 96 well plate with 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Caspase-Glo 3/7) or 60 μM MG-132 proteasome inhibitor (Caspase-Glo 8 and 9) to reduce non-specific signal. The plate was shaken at 400 rpm for 30 s and then transferred to a Synergy microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) at 25 °C. Luminescence readings were subsequently collected every 2 min for 2 h. Protein samples were prepared in a hypotonic extraction buffer and assayed in duplicate at a final protein concentration of 20 μg per mL of buffer. Duplicate blank reactions consisting of buffer plus proteasome inhibitor were included for each set of samples, and the average was subtracted as background.Protease inhibitor treatments To determine the contributions of different caspases to bacteria-induced apoptosis, hatchling animals were exposed to a series of targeted protease inhibitors. The inhibitors used in this study include the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK, the caspase 8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO, and the caspase 9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CMK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) as well as the irreversible serine protease inhibitor, Pefabloc (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). All inhibitor solutions were 0.22 µm-filter sterilized and stored at – 80 °C until use. Caspase inhibitors were used at final concentrations of 60 and 100 μM for vial and HARV experiments, respectively. For all experiments, the final concentration of the serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc was 25 μM. These concentrations were chosen in part as they did not cause apparent toxicity to the animal and did not impede colonization. Inhibitor treatment occurred for 2 h before the start of the experiment. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) controls were run in parallel where appropriate.Quantifying apoptotic development in the CEA of the light organ To visualize and quantify apoptosis in the light organ, hatchling animals were anesthetized and stained in a 1:1 solution of 0.37 MgCl2 and FSW containing 0.001% acridine orange dye, which intercalates into the condensed chromatin of dying cells (i.e., pycnotic nuclei) [18]. After staining, a ventral dissection was performed to expose the light organ, and the pycnotic nuclei in each lobe of the light organ were counted via FITC epifluorescence microscopy with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).Supplementary Information Additional file 1.
