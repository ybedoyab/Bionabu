    "abstract": "Abstract Renewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a substitute or extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters derived from plant or animal fats. Biodiesel can be blended up to 20% v/v with ultra-low sulfur diesel (i.e., B20) and used interchangeably with diesel engines and infrastructure. The addition of biodiesel, however, has been linked to increased susceptibility to biodegradation. Microorganisms proliferating via degradation of biodiesel blends have been linked to microbiologically influenced corrosion in the laboratory, but not measured directly in storage tanks (i.e., in situ). To measure in situ microbial proliferation, fuel degradation and microbially influenced corrosion, we conducted a yearlong study of B20 storage tanks in operation at two locations, identified the microorganisms associated with fuel fouling, and measured in situ corrosion. The bacterial populations were more diverse than the fungal populations, and largely unique to each location. The bacterial populations included members of the Acetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Proteobacteria. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same taxa, including a filamentous fungus within the family Trichocomaceae, not yet widely recognized as a contaminant of petroleum fuels, and the Saccharomycetaceae family of yeasts. Increases in the absolute and relative abundances of the Trichocomaceae were correlated with significant, visible fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identified the relationship between fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion and the microorganisms responsible, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks. To our knowledge this is the first in situ study of this scale incorporating community and corrosion measurements in an active biodiesel storage environment.

    "introduction": "Introduction The use of renewable fuels is on the rise worldwide (Beiter and Tian, 2016). One renewable fuel in use broadly is biodiesel, which is composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) derived from plant and animal lipids. Biodiesel is commonly used as a replacement or additive to ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) up to 5% v/v to restore lubricity lost due to the removal of sulfur compounds (Steidley and Knothe, 2005; Moser, 2009; Gill et al., 2012). Blends containing up to 20% v/v biodiesel (i.e., B20) can be used without changes to existing engines or infrastructure (U.S. Air Force Energy Strategic Plan [USAF], 2010). Combustion of these blends produces reduced nitric oxide emissions, an ozone precursor of concern, than pure biodiesel fuel (Basha et al., 2009). The consumption of biodiesel has increased worldwide over the past 10 years because of its combustion properties (Chang et al., 1996; Canakci, 2007), performance advantages, and increasingly strict emissions regulations (Blakeley, 2012). The advantages offered by blending biodiesel with ULSD are potentially offset by the drawback of lower fuel stability (Lisiecki et al., 2014). Biodiesel contains more dissolved oxygen than ULSD, reducing oxidative stability and increasing the risk of fuel biodegradation (Speidel et al., 2000). Biodiesel is also more hygroscopic than ULSD (Fregolente et al., 2012), causing blends like B20 to absorb and retain more water. Water in fuel represents habitat for microorganisms and is essential for microbial metabolism and growth; water entrained within fuel enables microbiological proliferation, resulting in fouling. Liquid water is denser than fuel and will accumulate at the bottom of any storage vessel. Microorganisms at the fuel-water interface are able to live in an aqueous environment with the fuel as an oxidizable substrate and source of dissolved oxygen (Prince et al., 2008). Fouling (e.g., the accumulation of biomass) is greatest at the fuel-water interface and microbial metabolism quickly depletes any oxygen in the water (Prince et al., 2008; Owsianiak et al., 2009; Bucker et al., 2011; Passman, 2013). Microbial growth and subsequent corrosion are dependent upon fuel chemistry and the amount of water present (Aktas et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010). Biodiesel and biodiesel blends do not contain free fatty acids by specification, but copious amounts of fatty acids are produced as bi-products of the metabolism of FAME by microorganisms (Aktas et al., 2010; Yassine et al., 2013) that may result in microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) of steel tanks or tank components. Polymer tank seals and fittings that are also exposed to organic acids can exhibit decreased ductility and strength. Production of CO2 during the microbial metabolism of FAME could also increase the rate of corrosion within a storage tank (Crolet et al., 1999). General production and dissolution of acid and CO2 within a fluid can result in uniform corrosion, where the loss of material is distributed across a surface. The accumulation of biofilms results in several possible outcomes including the localized production and concentration of corrosive compounds, the formation of galvanic couples, and the ennoblement of steel surfaces. Any of these would result in localized corrosion that is characterized by deep, penetrating pits on metallic surfaces that represent a great risk to storage tank infrastructure (Lee et al., 2009; Little and Lee, 2014). The link between biodegradation and corrosion has been studied in other petroleum environments such as oil production, drilling (Duncan et al., 2009; Stevenson et al., 2011), or storage of petroleum products in marine environments including biodiesel (Aktas et al., 2010; Lyles et al., 2013) yet no in situ study exists to this point in B20 storage and distribution systems. For over a decade, the United States Air Force (USAF) has stored B20 biodiesel and used it in non-tactical support vehicles as a component of their Strategic Energy Plan (Blakeley, 2012). The adoption of B20 biodiesel by the USAF, however, correlated with an increase in reports of “bad fuel,” or fouling due to visible particulates in the fuel and clogged filters at dispensers. We hypothesized that the reported fouling was microbiological in origin, rather than from the abiotic production of waxes in fuel that was suspected by fuel operators and reported previously (Tang et al., 2008; Botella et al., 2014). Both fuel fouling and MIC have the potential to impact the operation of B20 biodiesel storage and distribution systems. Pure cultures and enrichments of microorganisms have shown the ability to degrade biodiesel blends (including B20) and induce corrosion under laboratory conditions (Prince et al., 2008; Bucker et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011) but no studies link the microbial community and its proliferation with corrosion in active storage tanks over time. To this end, we conducted a rare longitudinal study, in situ, of microbial community dynamics linked to the corrosion of steel in B20 biodiesel underground storage tanks (UST). Two USAF locations housing B20 biodiesel tanks with recurrent fuel quality issues were selected for this study. We hypothesized that the reported issues were the result of microbial contamination and predicted that corrosion would be greatest in tanks with the most biomass. We subsequently conducted a 1-year survey of the microbial communities present at both storage locations to link microbiological fouling, fuel degradation, and MIC in situ within each storage tank.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Description of Sampling Sites The yearlong longitudinal study described here was conducted at two USAF bases, which were located in the SE and SW United States. Each base had three storage tanks containing B20 biodiesel (total of 6 tanks) that were under normal operation throughout the study. The only exception was tank SE 3, which was removed from the study after 9 months due to severe microbiological contamination that required mitigation. These tanks were not on a defined cleaning schedule. Instead, they were taken offline and cleaned as fouling or contamination was detected. All tanks at SW and two tanks at SE (SE 3 and 4) were cleaned just prior to the onset of the study and insertion of corrosion or “witness” coupons. The sampled tanks had an atmospheric (i.e., oxic) headspace and no biocides were used in the fuels stored at each location. The three tanks at SW were constructed of uncoated carbon steel and installed in the early 1950s. At the SE site, two of the tanks (SE 3 and SE 4) were fiberglass and located at the same fueling station. The third tank (SE E) was made of carbon steel, lined on the outside with fiberglass, and located at another fueling station. Each of the six tanks had a large maintenance hatch (i.e., “manway”) that was used as an access point for access and fuel sampling (Supplementary Figure S1). A visual overview of the sampling protocol, including references to the relevant methods sections is included for clarity as Supplementary Figure S3. In situ Incubation and Sampling of Corrosion Coupons A PVC rack was used to suspend materials in the fuel phase (60 cm from bottom of tank, top of rack) and in contact with any water phase if it existed (1 cm from bottom of tank, bottom of rack) (Supplementary Figure S2). Four types of materials typical of fuel systems were exposed to these in situ conditions: pre-weighed uncoated and epoxy-coated steel (ACT Test Panel LLC., Hillsdale, MI, United States) test specimens commonly known as “witness coupons,” and O-Rings made of V747-75 fluorocarbon or N602-70 nitrile, polymers commonly used in fuel systems (Personal communication, Air Force Petroleum Office). Epoxy coated coupons were prepared by the AFRL Coatings Technology Integration Office (Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, United States) using three coats- (1) A base of MIL-P-24441/20 epoxy/polyamide, formula 150 type III; (2) An intermediate coat of MIL-P-244413/30 epoxy/polyamide, formula 151 type IV; and (3) A topcoat of MIL-P-24441/31 epoxy/polyamide, formula 152 type IV. The metal test specimens (uncoated, n = 396, and epoxy-coated steel, n = 283) measured 2.54 cm × 7.62 cm were divided evenly between the top and bottom of each rack and removed at ≈3-month intervals at SE, or ≈6-month intervals at SW. As a control, sterile, uncoated witness coupons and sterile O-rings were incubated separately in 0.22 μm filter-sterilized B20 taken from fuel samples received at each site prior to exposure to storage tanks (n = 9 for each location). Replicate witness coupons (n ≥ 5) were removed from each underground storage tank (UST) at specified time intervals and photographed on-site. Sampled coupons were subjected to several types of analyses: characterization of biofilm microbial communities by DNA sequencing, microscopy, and quantitation of uniform and pitting corrosion by mass loss and microscopy, respectively. A schematic representation of the sampling workflow is shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Biofilms were sampled for molecular community analyses from triplicate (n = 3) witness coupons immediately following their removal from the tank as detailed below. Any biofilm present on the remaining two (n = 2) coupons was left intact. Otherwise, all coupons were stored in a desiccating environment to prevent additional corrosion and shipped overnight prior to further analyses. Sampling, DNA Extraction, Small Subunit rRNA Gene Library Preparation, and Sequencing of Microbial Biomass Samples of both biofilms and fuel were taken at each timepoint for molecular analyses, as summarized in Supplementary Figure S3. For molecular analyses of biofilm, the surface of each coupon was immediately sampled after removal from the tank using nylon flocked swabs (Therapak Corp, Los Angeles, CA, United States). Each swab was placed into a 2.0 mL ZR BashingBeadTM Lysis Tube (Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA, United States) containing 0.7 mL (dry volume) of 0.5 mm ZR BashingBeadTM lysis matrix (Zymo Research Corp.) and 750 μL XpeditionTM Lysis/Stabilization Solution (Zymo Research Corp.) and homogenized for 30 s on site using a sample cup attached to a cordless reciprocating saw. Fuel samples were collected and processed within 2–4 h. Fuel samples were taken at each time point from the bottom of each tank via the access hatch using a 500 mL Bacon bomb fuel sampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, United States). Approximately 1 L of fuel was filtered through a 120 mm 0.22 μm polyether sulfone bottle-top filter. At SE, the filtered fuel was also retained for acid-index determination. The resulting filter was quartered after sampling using a sterile scalpel, and three of these quarters were placed into individual ZR BashingBeadTM Lysis tubes containing 0.7 mL (dry volume) of 0.5 mm ZR BashingBeadTM lysis matrix (Zymo Research Corp.) and 750 μL XpeditionTM Lysis/Stabilization Solution (Zymo Research Corp.), for a total of three technical replicates per sampling. These samples were homogenized for 30 s on site using a sample cup attached to a cordless reciprocating saw, transported overnight at room temperature and stored at −20°C until needed. Prior to DNA extraction, the samples were homogenized for an additional 30 s using a BioSpec Mini-BeadBeater-8 (Biospec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK, United States). DNA extractions were performed per manufacturer specifications using the Zymo XpeditionTM Kit (Zymo Research Corp.). Libraries of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene fragments were amplified from each DNA extraction using a single set of PCR with primers that spanned the SSU rRNA gene V4/V5 hypervariable regions between position 515 and 926 (E. coli numbering) as described previously (Parada et al., 2015; Kraus et al., 2018). The primers used were selected to evenly amplify all three domains of life simultaneously (Parada et al., 2015). To mitigate the effects of contaminating DNA (Salter et al., 2014), multiple extraction blanks and negative controls were sequenced from each batch of extractions. All SSU rRNA gene libraries were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq V2 PE250 chemistry at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. Analysis of SSU rRNA Gene Sequencing Libraries Initial quality control, demultiplexing, and OTU clustering at 97 percent sequence similarity was performed as previously described (Stamps et al., 2016), with the modification of using mothur (Schloss et al., 2009) to assign taxonomy against the SILVA database (r128) (Pruesse et al., 2007) formatted for use with mothur. Statistical analyses and figures were generated within R using Phyloseq (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013) and AmpVis (Albertsen et al., 2015). Differences in community composition were estimated using the weighted UniFrac index (Lozupone and Knight, 2005). Datasets were rarefied to 2000 sequences per sample for bacteria/archaea, and 1500 sequences per sample for the eukarya to produce ordinations and perform PERMANOVA analyses. The effect of site, tank, material, and the location of materials within each tank (top or bottom) were tested by a PERMANOVA within the R package Vegan (Dixon, 2003). Sequencing reads are available under the accessions SRR5826605-SRR5826609. The mapping file necessary for demultiplexing in QIIME is available in Supplementary Table S1. Estimation of Final Coupon Biomass The growth of biofilms within the tanks was determined by measuring the biomass attached to the polymer-coated witness coupons. After 12 months of exposure (9 months for SE 3), all pre-weighed polymer coated coupons were removed from each UST at both locations, photographed on site, placed into sterile 50 mL conical tubes, and shipped overnight for further analysis. Upon arrival, coupons were desiccated to remove any water or fuel, weighed, and then cleaned using the ASTM standard G1-03 hydrochloric acid method (G01 Committee, 2012). Briefly, coupons were sonicated for 10 min in soapy water, rinsed in deionized water, dried, and incubated in 3 M hydrochloric acid with 3.5 g/L hexamethylene tetramine solution for 10 min. Acid cleaned coupons were washed in deionized water, acetone, and methanol, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and weighed. Biomass at 12 months was estimated as the difference in the weight of the coupons prior to cleaning (after desiccation) and after cleaning. No obvious degradation of the polymer coating was observed visually before or after removal of the biofilm from sampled coupons. Microscopy and Determination of Corrosion on Witness Coupons Biofilms were visualized on undisturbed uncoated steel witness coupons (n = 2 per UST, per timepoint) by optical and electron microscopy prior to coupon cleaning. For determination of general corrosion, biofilm and corrosion products were removed from coupons (n = 5 per UST, per timepoint) via ASTM standard G1-03 C.3.5 (G01 Committee, 2012) as detailed in section “Analysis of SSU rRNA Gene Sequencing Libraries.” After cleaning, the mass of each coupon was compared to its pre-exposure mass to determine mass loss. A subset of steel witness coupons (n = 2 per time point) was imaged by several complementary approaches: SEM, confocal microscopy, and profilometry. Coupons with intact biofilms that were intended for microscopic analysis were scored with a 2 × 14 grid to enable correlation between locations imaged prior to the removal of biomass and after imaging for pitting corrosion via profilometry (each quadrant roughly 9 × 11 mm). Select coupons were then imaged with the biofilm in place using a VHX 2000E (Keyence Corp., Itasca, IL, United States) digital microscope from 20 to 200× magnification. Areas of interest were subsequently imaged using an FEI Quanta 600 environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Waltham, MA, United States). Three to five areas were imaged with SEM per coupon. Coupons designated for pitting measurement were imaged after cleaning using a VK-X250 3D Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Keyence Corp., Itasca, IL, United States) to measure the depth of each pit and surface roughness. Each coupon was imaged under 10× magnification at 42 identical locations. Maximum pitting rates (recorded as MPY) were calculated for each sample point by the formula D⁢e⁢e⁢p⁢e⁢s⁢t⁢P⁢i⁢t⁢(m⁢m)× 365E⁢x⁢p⁢o⁢s⁢u⁢r⁢e⁢T⁢i⁢m⁢e⁢(D⁢a⁢y⁢s) to calculate the rate of corrosion in mm/year and then converted to a value of MPY by multiplying the result by 39.4 (1 mm/y = 39.4 MPY). Pits were defined as a region that was a minimum of 10 μm below the mathematically determined reference plane (surface) and at least 200 μm2 in area. A Shapiro-Wilk (Shapiro and Wilk, 1965) test of normalcy (p > 0.05) was used to determine normality of the dataset, after which a non-parametric Van der Waerden test (Van Der Waerden, 1953) was used to compare field coupons to sterile controls. Multiple pairwise tests comparing in situ incubations to controls were carried out post hoc using a Conover test (Gellings and Gudger, 2012) within the package MR, and p values were corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) method (Yekutieli and Benjamini, 2001) within MR. Correlation between the presence of biofilm and corrosion was determined using coupons scored with a diamond knife to facilitate sample orientation, which were imaged by SEM and by confocal microscopy VK-X250. Tensile Testing of Polymeric Seal Materials At each time point, O-ring specimens (n = 3) were removed from each tank and the sterile controls, photographed on-site, and the accumulated biofilm was removed prior to testing. The cleaned O-rings were placed into sterile 50 ml conical tubes and shipped overnight for analysis. Tensile testing (strength and elongation) of the O-rings was conducted at the University of Dayton Research Institute in accordance with the test methods and procedures referenced in ASTM D1414 and included analyses of percent elongation, tensile strength, and maximum load. Determination of Fuel Acid Index The acid index of fuel samples taken from the bottom of tanks at the SE location was measured by acid titration using the ASTM standard D974 (D27 Committee, 2008) method at the 3, 7, and 9 months time points. Approximately 20 g of B20 suspended in 100 mL of titration solvent (100:1: 99 Toluene/Water/Isopropyl alcohol) and 0.5 mL of an indicator solution was titrated using a 0.1 N solution of KOH dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (Sigma Aldrich).",
    "results": "Results Microbial Diversity and Taxonomic Composition Surface samples taken at each time point in each UST from coated coupons, uncoated coupons, and O-rings (representing biofilm communities), and filter quarters (representing fuel communities) were sequenced after sampling. After clustering and quality control, 3.04 million reads remained, which clustered into 759 OTUs across all three domains of life from 306 samples (Supplementary Table S2). Mean library size for Bacteria and Archaea was 6857 reads, and 3470 for the Eukarya (Supplementary Table S2). Due to low sequence count, after rarefaction 59 samples and 9 OTUs were removed from beta diversity analyses within the bacterial/archaeal dataset, while 76 samples and 29 OTUs were removed from the eukaryotic dataset. The community structure and composition of sampled biofilms varied significantly between bases (Bacteria p = 0.001; R2 = 0.12, Eukaryota p = 0.001; R2 = 0.23) and among different tanks at each base (Bacteria p = 0.001; R2 = 0.37, Eukaryota p = 0.001; R2 = 0.34). Members of the Acetobacteraceae (acetic acid bacteria) or the Clostridiaceae group 1 were the most abundant taxa detected in the tanks at SW, whereas OTUs most closely related to the genera Pannonibacter (Family Rhodobacteraceae) and Nitrospirillum (Family Rhodospirillaceae) were more abundant in SE tanks (Figure 1). An OTU (OTU 1 within the Eukaryotic dataset) that was present and often very abundant at both locations was identified as an unclassified member of the Eurotiomycetes. Additional identification via BLAST suggested that it was a filamentous fungus, most likely a member of the genus Byssochlamys (Family Trichocomaceae). The microbial communities at SE also intermittently contained a population of yeast most closely related to the genera Saccharomyces and Wickerhamomyces (Family Saccharomycetaceae) (Figure 2). A summary of all detected taxa can be found in Supplementary Table S2. FIGURE 1.

For each taxon shown, the heat map is divided into samples which were suspended from the top and bottom of the PVC rack. Taxonomic identity for each OTU is shown as the most likely genus (if identifiable) and phylum. For clarity, Proteobacterial classes are shown in place of the phylum designation.FIGURE 2.

Taxonomic identity for each OTU is shown as the most likely genus (if identifiable) and phylum. Black boxes denote that insufficient numbers of sequence were avalible to analyze for those timepoints.Ordination based on Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) using the weighted UniFrac distance among microbial communities including both fuel and biofilms indicated that these communities differed by site (Figure 3). Eukaryotic samples from SW grouped closely together visually by ordination compared to those from SE, which clustered more closely by tank rather than location (Figure 3B). Small differences were detected between samples of fuel and biofilm at each sampling point among the bacteria (Supplementary Figure S4A), but there was little to no difference among the eukarya (Supplementary Figure S4B). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Weighted UniFrac principal coordinate ordination of the Bacterial (A) and Eukaryotic (B) biofilm communities. Points are separated by location – SE (circles) and SW (triangles). Colors represent individual tanks at each location. Site Observations, Biomass, and Corrosion Measurements Total dry weight biomass after 12 months of exposure to fouled fuel was greatest at SW, with SW 2 having the greatest fouling of coupon surfaces (Supplementary Figure S5). Overall, coupons at SW were consistently coated in greater amounts of biofilm/material (Supplementary Figure S6) and had greater final biomass than those sampled at SE. A total of 242 coupons (including controls) were used in the analysis of mass loss, and 280 coupons (including controls) were used for pitting and roughness analyses between bases. The pitting analyses generated a total of 37,289 measurements from the 280 coupons and surface roughness analyses generated a total of 12,810 measurements from the 280 sampled coupons. Witness coupons from tanks at SW consistently experienced greater amounts of corrosion than those at SE (Supplementary Figure S7). All coupons exposed to SW tank systems had significantly more corrosion than controls exposed to sterile fuel. At SE both SE 3 and SE E had significantly more corrosion than controls while SE 4 coupons were not significantly different from sterile fuel controls (Supplementary Table S3). Coupons exposed to conditions in SW tanks had deeper pits than coupons from the SE location and controls (Figure 4). Over time, the skewedness of pit distribution on exposed coupons was greater than the controls (Figure 4). Surface roughness also increased over time (Supplementary Figure S8) and was the greatest on coupons from SW 2. Tanks at SW, and SE 3 had the highest pitting rate (Table 1). Corrosion rates on the bottom coupons in SW 2 and SW 4 bottom exceeded 8 MPY. Compared to coupons attached to the top of the rack, coupons placed at the bottom of tanks had deeper pits (Figure 4, p < 0.001), but surface roughness was not significantly different (p = 0.34, Supplementary Figure S8). There was little to no effect on load strength, tensile strength, or elongation among tanks of o-rings exposed to fuel at either the top or the bottom of the rack (Supplementary Figure S9). FIGURE 4.

The elevated acidity corresponded elevated corrosion rates and maximum pit depths in SE tank 3 relative to other tanks at SE. By 9 months, fuel in SE tank 3 exceeded the ASTM standard limit of 0.3 mg KOH/g B20 for fuel acidity (Table 2). Witness coupons imaged by SEM from both bases were covered by morphologically similar biofilms (Figure 5A), which were primarily comprised of fungal hyphae (Figure 5C). Pits on the coupon surfaces were correlated with areas that contained biofilm prior to cleaning (Figures 5B,D). TABLE 2.

    "discussion": "Discussion The advantages of blending or replacing ULSD with biodiesel include increased fuel performance and significant reductions in carbon emissions (Gill et al., 2012). Enhanced fuel standards have resulted in a worldwide increase in biodiesel consumption from 2.2 million liters per day (lpd) in 2000 to 84.3 million lpd in 2014 (Beiter and Tian, 2016). The USAF started using B20 biodiesel in non-emergency, non-tactical ground vehicles and consumed 12.1 million liters of biodiesel per year in 2010 (U.S. Air Force Energy Strategic Plan [USAF], 2010). A potentially significant disadvantage to their adoption of B20 biodiesel was an increase in reports of fuel biocontamination. The main objectives of this study were to characterize the microbial communities responsible for fouling of B20 biodiesel and determine whether their proliferation and biofilms are associated with increased rates of corrosion of in-service B20 storage tanks. Microorganisms can more readily metabolize the FAME in biodiesel blends, leading to fouling in fuel storage systems (Prince et al., 2008). Fuel fouling and degradation are not the only concerns, as increased rates of corrosion have been observed when microorganisms proliferate in biodiesel under laboratory conditions (Aktas et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010). A recent EPA study reported moderate or severe corrosion in 83% of inspected storage tanks (US EPA, 2016), suggesting an additional impact on fuel infrastructure could be linked to the degradation of biodiesel. Recent work has identified the metabolism of microorganisms in biodiesel blends that results in biodegradation (Bücker et al., 2018) but microbial communities in non-marine environments have not yet been directly linked to increased corrosion rates in situ. In this work, we conducted the first longitudinal study co-locating the microorganisms known to be responsible for fuel fouling, acid production, and microbially influenced corrosion on “witness” coupons installed near the bottom of tanks in situ. Our study established a link between fuel fouling and increased biofilm biomass comprised of specific fungal and bacterial taxa in operational B20 biodiesel tanks. We also linked biomass within B20 storage tanks to pitting corrosion, co-located with the microbial biofilms. The direct linkage between fuel fouling and corrosion is of considerable concern to tank operations. The most damaging MIC is associated with multispecies biofilms, where interactions between different microorganisms can create a cascade of biochemical reactions between the oxic and anoxic regions (Videla and Characklis, 1992; Little and Lee, 2014). Microbial biofilms and their associated metabolic activities can exacerbate corrosion via several mechanisms. Under anoxic conditions and in the presence of oxidized sulfur compounds, sulfur reducing microorganisms can cause corrosion of iron by either removing electrons from a hydrogen film on the metal surface (EMIC) or directly from the Fe0 itself (CMIC) (Enning et al., 2012; Venzlaff et al., 2012; Enning and Garrelfs, 2014). Very little sulfur would be expected in B20 composed of 80% ultralow sulfur diesel and no sulfate-reducing taxa were detected in our molecular analyses, supporting the conclusion that any form of MIC related to anoxic sulfur metabolism was not occurring in these tanks. Other microorganisms known to participate in CMIC, such as iron-oxidizing bacteria (e.g., Gallionella sp., Leptothrix sp., and Mariprofundus sp.) (McBeth et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017) and methanogenic archaea (Enning et al., 2012) were not detected in biofilm or fuel samples. Biofilms associated with the greatest amount of MIC in our study were composed largely of the filamentous fungus Byssochlamys sp. and acid-producing bacteria (e.g., Gluconacetobacter sp.). The Byssochlamys sp. mycelial hyphae and the biofilm itself most certainly can facilitate the partitioning of areas containing dissolved oxygen and anoxic sites, thus creating an electrochemical oxygen concentration corrosion cell (Videla and Herrera, 2005; Little et al., 2008). Areas of anoxia become anodic sites, where aggressive, localized pitting can occur. Acid production by bacteria and fungi within the biofilm cane also generate localized areas of low pH, further exacerbating the solubilization of metal from the surface (Little and Ray, 2001; Juzeliünas et al., 2007). We found that the microbial communities forming observable growth in the B20 tanks contained abundant taxa known to oxidize the fatty acids or fatty acid methyl esters present in B20 biodiesel. Limitations for growth of bacteria and fungi in B20 is likely controlled by availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, an electron acceptor, or the presence of water (i.e., physical space at the fuel-water interface). Bacterial taxa potentially capable of nitrogen fixation (Nitrospirillum and Burkholderia) were present and abundant when biomass was high. Both Nitrospirillum and Burkholderia have the capacity for nitrogen fixation and thus could be providing the greater microbial community with a source of fixed nitrogen for growth (Estrada-De Los Santos et al., 2001; Chung et al., 2015), living in coexistence with the microorganisms responsible for fuel acidification via the production of organic acids that result in corrosion of metallic surfaces within the tanks. Aerobic metabolism at the fuel:water interphase would lead to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in water at the bottom of storage tanks. In the absence of other electron acceptors, fermentation would be the main type of microbial metabolism in the water phase, leading to the production of copious organic acids. For example, members of the Firmicutes genus Caproiciproducens were abundant in SW tanks and can produce numerous organic acids including caproic, butyric, and acetic acid under anaerobic fermentative growth (Kim et al., 2015). Anaerobic, fermentative microorganisms like the Clostridiaceae (including Caproiciproducens), were also abundant at SW in all three tanks. Aerobic microorganisms, members of the Alphaproteoba cteria that are closely related to Gluconacetobacter and unclassified Acetobacteraceae, were abundant in samples from SW tanks. These microorganisms are capable of producing large quantities of acetic acid and producing viscous biofilms of cellulose, which could enhance their ability to maintain a physical presence at the fuel-water interface and exacerbate corrosion and fouling (Castro et al., 2012; Tazato et al., 2012). The presence of aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and strictly anaerobic bacteria in the tanks is indicative of the sharp gradient in oxygenation. Most likely, the bulk fuel samples taken at the bottom of storage tanks mixed these microorganisms that were otherwise segregated by fine scale gradients of oxygenated fuel and anoxic water. In contrast to the bacteria, the fungal community was less diverse and more homogenous across all locations. Fungi representing a single, highly abundant OTU closely related to the genus Byssochlamys was found in all tanks exhibiting fouling. Members of the genus Byssochlamys have been linked to the contamination of acidic fruit juices and are capable of propagating across a broad range of pH and temperatures under oxic conditions (Tournas, 2008). A member of the genus Byssochlamys was recently isolated from biodiesel in Hawaii, and characterized for its ability to degrade ULSD and biodiesel (Ye et al., 2017). Byssochlamys spores can withstand boiling (high temperatures are a part of the biodiesel production process), low concentrations of oxygen that may exist at the bottom of a fuel tank, and pH values as low as 3.5 as microbial community members begin to acidify water at the bottom of a fuel tank (Tournas, 2008). Additionally, members of the anamorph of Byssochlamys, Paecilomyces, are known to ferment under anaerobic conditions, producing acetate and ethanol (Mountfort and Rhodes, 1991). Unclassified Eurotiomycetes (identified as Byssochlamys) was numerically dominant in all tanks at SW over time with much lower observable diversity than the Bacteria. The abundance of these fungi likely contributes to the increased acidity observed in tanks at SE as well as to the acidification and fouling of fuels at SW. Filamentous fungi such as Byssochlamys may also provide a surface for bacteria to exploit, encouraging biofilm production in fuel (Guennoc et al., 2017). SEM analysis of fouled coupons showed co-location of rod-shaped bacteria with the fungal filaments (data not shown). Ours is the first study to conclusively show the biocontamination of B20 biodiesel in situ dominated by Byssochlamys-like OTUs, and to establish the relationship between their abundance and in situ corrosion. Major differences in community membership were detected between locations and among individual tanks. However, there was no obvious correlation between community membership and environmental (local temperature or rainfall) or operational variables. As a result, we do not have definitive evidence as to why specific microorganisms were associated with a single tank or location. Tank material almost certainly was a factor – corroding steel tanks represent a more reducing environment than the relatively more inert fiberglass tanks, encouraging the growth of anaerobic microorganisms such as Caproiciproducens as observed in SW. The tank SW 2 had the greatest amount of corrosion, although another steel tank, SE E, produced much lower amounts of corrosion suggesting that something more than tank material may play a role in the corrosion rate and microbial communities observed. The data presented in this study highlights the spatial heterogeneity of microbial communities within B20 storage tanks. Most of the detected taxa were found in similar relative abundances both in the top and bottom of each sampled coupon rack, suggesting there is little difference in the microbial communities that occur within these areas of each tank. The greatest differences were observed in SW 2, where differences in the relative abundances of the Clostridium sensu strictu 12 and unclassified Acetobacteraceae were noted both over time, and in position within the tank. This could be due to a decrease in the amount of dissolved oxygen both in the fuel and water bottom; OTUs related to Clostridium (strict anaerobic microorganisms) increased over time in the upper position while the Unclassified Acetobacterace decreased. Because each storage tank was in operation while it was being monitored, it is also possible that there was a mixing effect on the community as fuel and water levels changed over time, making it difficult to discern differences in community structure between locations in each tank. Shared among all of the sampled tanks, was the presence of a mixed microbial community of both fungi and bacteria that appeared capable of fermentation and the production of organic acids that would increase localized corrosion on metallic surfaces. The corrosion measured in this study likely resulted from the presence of microbial biofilms causing localized pitting corrosion. The localized production of acids within biofilms created an environment that was favorable for the induction of pitting corrosion similar to that observed within our study (Lee et al., 2010). Our in situ study showed greater corrosion near the bottom of each tank where the presence of water and a fuel-water interface was more likely. The interaction of fuel and water allows for enhanced microbial growth, and in turn, greater corrosion than water limited spaces within a fuel tank. Indeed, the greatest corrosion rates observed were in tanks at SW (>8 MPY), where fungal fouling was the most prolific. Rates of corrosion appeared to decline from 7 to 12 months, suggesting passivation may have taken place. Alternatively, the apparent shallowing of pits could be explained by an increase in uniform corrosion, that was observed in SW tanks, which could make pits appear shallower. The exact mechanism of corrosion remains to be deciphered – while steel corrosion is commonly associated with sulfate reduction and the production of sulfide (Lee et al., 2009), no sulfate reducing bacteria were identified within any of the community surveys. The greatest levels of corrosion observed in the SW tanks correlated with the presence of anaerobic Clostridia and high relative abundances of OTUs most closely related to Byssochlamys, suggesting that corrosion in these tanks was the result of the production of organic acids during the metabolism (either fermentative or aerobic) of FAMEs present within B20. The presence of organic acids produced as a consequence of fuel degradation may also aide in further growth of organisms that can directly incorporate these metabolites into their own cell wall, as was recently observed in an alkane degrading culture (Konieczna et al., 2018). Although we observed biomass including both bacterial and fungi on polymer coated coupons and polymeric O-rings that could degrade or otherwise damage materials (Cregut et al., 2013; Hung et al., 2016), polymer degradation was not detected. It is possible that the polymers tested in this study were resistant to degradation over the period of the study and that a much longer exposure time was required. Our data supports the idea that tank contamination contributes to an increased risk of corrosion but not, apparently, to polymeric degradation. We can only speculate how the fuel storage tanks became contaminated. All of the tanks sampled, with the exception of SE E, were cleaned just prior to the beginning of in situ measurements. Within 6 months, however, a dense fungal mat was visible on coupons removed from many of the tanks. Spores of Byssochlamys may enter through the vents from wind-blown dust or enter as a part of the fuel production process in otherwise “clean” fuel. Nevertheless, biofilms were repeatedly found on the in situ coupons and sampling racks near the bottom of each tank in a relatively rapid timeframe. It is highly likely that after a tank is colonized, the established community of the tank is the likely source of recurrent contamination, instead of microorganisms immigrating from air vents or water ingress.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion The comprehensive, in situ investigation presented here compliments several other laboratory-based studies (Leung et al., 2006; Bucker et al., 2011; Ching et al., 2016). Together, they illustrate the susceptibility of fuels containing biodiesel to microbial proliferation (fouling), fuel biodegradation, and MIC of associated infrastructure. Here though, we were able to directly link the presence and prevalence of biofilms to pitting corrosion in actively operating B20 storage tanks. We found that a mixed microbial community of filamentous fungi and acid-producing bacteria were able to proliferate in B20 biodiesel storage tanks, cause fouling, degrade fuel by metabolizing the FAME, produce organic acids, and accelerate steel corrosion under biofilms attached to metal surfaces. The same fungal species was responsible for “blooms” of biomass, providing a target for future mitigation strategies. Additional research is underway to characterize this most abundant fungal member of fuels and biofilms observed at both locations (Stamps et al., 2018). Despite the trade-offs in fuel stability due to susceptibility to microbial attack, biodiesel continues to be the most common and economical solution to reduce the environmental impact of petroleum diesel combustion. As such, the use of biodiesel will likely continue to increase worldwide for the foreseeable future. Operator vigilance in fuel quality and storage conditions is required including early mitigation through water removal, cleaning, and even biocide treatment. Each of these methods would likely be the most effective means of controlling fouling, degradation, and corrosion through the prevention of microbial biofilm establishment. While B20 presents new storage challenges to operators, risk assessments informed by this study will aid each operator in formulating the appropriate response if contamination is detected.",

Copyright notice ID: 7055474 PMID: 32174893 Abstract Renewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a substitute or extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters derived from plant or animal fats. Biodiesel can be blended up to 20% v/v with ultra-low sulfur diesel (i.e., B20) and used interchangeably with diesel engines and infrastructure. The addition of biodiesel, however, has been linked to increased susceptibility to biodegradation. Microorganisms proliferating via degradation of biodiesel blends have been linked to microbiologically influenced corrosion in the laboratory, but not measured directly in storage tanks (i.e., in situ). To measure in situ microbial proliferation, fuel degradation and microbially influenced corrosion, we conducted a yearlong study of B20 storage tanks in operation at two locations, identified the microorganisms associated with fuel fouling, and measured in situ corrosion. The bacterial populations were more diverse than the fungal populations, and largely unique to each location. The bacterial populations included members of the Acetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Proteobacteria. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same taxa, including a filamentous fungus within the family Trichocomaceae, not yet widely recognized as a contaminant of petroleum fuels, and the Saccharomycetaceae family of yeasts. Increases in the absolute and relative abundances of the Trichocomaceae were correlated with significant, visible fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identified the relationship between fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion and the microorganisms responsible, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks. To our knowledge this is the first in situ study of this scale incorporating community and corrosion measurements in an active biodiesel storage environment. Keywords: biocorrosion, biofouling, fuel, biodiesel, B20, biodegradationIntroduction The use of renewable fuels is on the rise worldwide (Beiter and Tian, 2016). One renewable fuel in use broadly is biodiesel, which is composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) derived from plant and animal lipids. Biodiesel is commonly used as a replacement or additive to ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) up to 5% v/v to restore lubricity lost due to the removal of sulfur compounds (Steidley and Knothe, 2005; Moser, 2009; Gill et al., 2012). Blends containing up to 20% v/v biodiesel (i.e., B20) can be used without changes to existing engines or infrastructure (U.S. Air Force Energy Strategic Plan [USAF], 2010). Combustion of these blends produces reduced nitric oxide emissions, an ozone precursor of concern, than pure biodiesel fuel (Basha et al., 2009). The consumption of biodiesel has increased worldwide over the past 10 years because of its combustion properties (Chang et al., 1996; Canakci, 2007), performance advantages, and increasingly strict emissions regulations (Blakeley, 2012). The advantages offered by blending biodiesel with ULSD are potentially offset by the drawback of lower fuel stability (Lisiecki et al., 2014). Biodiesel contains more dissolved oxygen than ULSD, reducing oxidative stability and increasing the risk of fuel biodegradation (Speidel et al., 2000). Biodiesel is also more hygroscopic than ULSD (Fregolente et al., 2012), causing blends like B20 to absorb and retain more water. Water in fuel represents habitat for microorganisms and is essential for microbial metabolism and growth; water entrained within fuel enables microbiological proliferation, resulting in fouling. Liquid water is denser than fuel and will accumulate at the bottom of any storage vessel. Microorganisms at the fuel-water interface are able to live in an aqueous environment with the fuel as an oxidizable substrate and source of dissolved oxygen (Prince et al., 2008). Fouling (e.g., the accumulation of biomass) is greatest at the fuel-water interface and microbial metabolism quickly depletes any oxygen in the water (Prince et al., 2008; Owsianiak et al., 2009; Bucker et al., 2011; Passman, 2013). Microbial growth and subsequent corrosion are dependent upon fuel chemistry and the amount of water present (Aktas et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010). Biodiesel and biodiesel blends do not contain free fatty acids by specification, but copious amounts of fatty acids are produced as bi-products of the metabolism of FAME by microorganisms (Aktas et al., 2010; Yassine et al., 2013) that may result in microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) of steel tanks or tank components. Polymer tank seals and fittings that are also exposed to organic acids can exhibit decreased ductility and strength. Production of CO2 during the microbial metabolism of FAME could also increase the rate of corrosion within a storage tank (Crolet et al., 1999). General production and dissolution of acid and CO2 within a fluid can result in uniform corrosion, where the loss of material is distributed across a surface. The accumulation of biofilms results in several possible outcomes including the localized production and concentration of corrosive compounds, the formation of galvanic couples, and the ennoblement of steel surfaces. Any of these would result in localized corrosion that is characterized by deep, penetrating pits on metallic surfaces that represent a great risk to storage tank infrastructure (Lee et al., 2009; Little and Lee, 2014). The link between biodegradation and corrosion has been studied in other petroleum environments such as oil production, drilling (Duncan et al., 2009; Stevenson et al., 2011), or storage of petroleum products in marine environments including biodiesel (Aktas et al., 2010; Lyles et al., 2013) yet no in situ study exists to this point in B20 storage and distribution systems. For over a decade, the United States Air Force (USAF) has stored B20 biodiesel and used it in non-tactical support vehicles as a component of their Strategic Energy Plan (Blakeley, 2012). The adoption of B20 biodiesel by the USAF, however, correlated with an increase in reports of “bad fuel,” or fouling due to visible particulates in the fuel and clogged filters at dispensers. We hypothesized that the reported fouling was microbiological in origin, rather than from the abiotic production of waxes in fuel that was suspected by fuel operators and reported previously (Tang et al., 2008; Botella et al., 2014). Both fuel fouling and MIC have the potential to impact the operation of B20 biodiesel storage and distribution systems. Pure cultures and enrichments of microorganisms have shown the ability to degrade biodiesel blends (including B20) and induce corrosion under laboratory conditions (Prince et al., 2008; Bucker et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011) but no studies link the microbial community and its proliferation with corrosion in active storage tanks over time. To this end, we conducted a rare longitudinal study, in situ, of microbial community dynamics linked to the corrosion of steel in B20 biodiesel underground storage tanks (UST). Two USAF locations housing B20 biodiesel tanks with recurrent fuel quality issues were selected for this study. We hypothesized that the reported issues were the result of microbial contamination and predicted that corrosion would be greatest in tanks with the most biomass. We subsequently conducted a 1-year survey of the microbial communities present at both storage locations to link microbiological fouling, fuel degradation, and MIC in situ within each storage tank.Materials and Methods Description of Sampling Sites The yearlong longitudinal study described here was conducted at two USAF bases, which were located in the SE and SW United States. Each base had three storage tanks containing B20 biodiesel (total of 6 tanks) that were under normal operation throughout the study. The only exception was tank SE 3, which was removed from the study after 9 months due to severe microbiological contamination that required mitigation. These tanks were not on a defined cleaning schedule. Instead, they were taken offline and cleaned as fouling or contamination was detected. All tanks at SW and two tanks at SE (SE 3 and 4) were cleaned just prior to the onset of the study and insertion of corrosion or “witness” coupons. The sampled tanks had an atmospheric (i.e., oxic) headspace and no biocides were used in the fuels stored at each location. The three tanks at SW were constructed of uncoated carbon steel and installed in the early 1950s. At the SE site, two of the tanks (SE 3 and SE 4) were fiberglass and located at the same fueling station. The third tank (SE E) was made of carbon steel, lined on the outside with fiberglass, and located at another fueling station. Each of the six tanks had a large maintenance hatch (i.e., “manway”) that was used as an access point for access and fuel sampling (Supplementary Figure S1). A visual overview of the sampling protocol, including references to the relevant methods sections is included for clarity as Supplementary Figure S3. In situ Incubation and Sampling of Corrosion Coupons A PVC rack was used to suspend materials in the fuel phase (60 cm from bottom of tank, top of rack) and in contact with any water phase if it existed (1 cm from bottom of tank, bottom of rack) (Supplementary Figure S2). Four types of materials typical of fuel systems were exposed to these in situ conditions: pre-weighed uncoated and epoxy-coated steel (ACT Test Panel LLC., Hillsdale, MI, United States) test specimens commonly known as “witness coupons,” and O-Rings made of V747-75 fluorocarbon or N602-70 nitrile, polymers commonly used in fuel systems (Personal communication, Air Force Petroleum Office). Epoxy coated coupons were prepared by the AFRL Coatings Technology Integration Office (Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, United States) using three coats- (1) A base of MIL-P-24441/20 epoxy/polyamide, formula 150 type III; (2) An intermediate coat of MIL-P-244413/30 epoxy/polyamide, formula 151 type IV; and (3) A topcoat of MIL-P-24441/31 epoxy/polyamide, formula 152 type IV. The metal test specimens (uncoated, n = 396, and epoxy-coated steel, n = 283) measured 2.54 cm × 7.62 cm were divided evenly between the top and bottom of each rack and removed at ≈3-month intervals at SE, or ≈6-month intervals at SW. As a control, sterile, uncoated witness coupons and sterile O-rings were incubated separately in 0.22 μm filter-sterilized B20 taken from fuel samples received at each site prior to exposure to storage tanks (n = 9 for each location). Replicate witness coupons (n ≥ 5) were removed from each underground storage tank (UST) at specified time intervals and photographed on-site. Sampled coupons were subjected to several types of analyses: characterization of biofilm microbial communities by DNA sequencing, microscopy, and quantitation of uniform and pitting corrosion by mass loss and microscopy, respectively. A schematic representation of the sampling workflow is shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Biofilms were sampled for molecular community analyses from triplicate (n = 3) witness coupons immediately following their removal from the tank as detailed below. Any biofilm present on the remaining two (n = 2) coupons was left intact. Otherwise, all coupons were stored in a desiccating environment to prevent additional corrosion and shipped overnight prior to further analyses.Sampling, DNA Extraction, Small Subunit rRNA Gene Library Preparation, and Sequencing of Microbial Biomass Samples of both biofilms and fuel were taken at each timepoint for molecular analyses, as summarized in Supplementary Figure S3. For molecular analyses of biofilm, the surface of each coupon was immediately sampled after removal from the tank using nylon flocked swabs (Therapak Corp, Los Angeles, CA, United States). Each swab was placed into a 2.0 mL ZR BashingBeadTM Lysis Tube (Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA, United States) containing 0.7 mL (dry volume) of 0.5 mm ZR BashingBeadTM lysis matrix (Zymo Research Corp.) and 750 μL XpeditionTM Lysis/Stabilization Solution (Zymo Research Corp.) and homogenized for 30 s on site using a sample cup attached to a cordless reciprocating saw. Fuel samples were collected and processed within 2–4 h. Fuel samples were taken at each time point from the bottom of each tank via the access hatch using a 500 mL Bacon bomb fuel sampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, United States). Approximately 1 L of fuel was filtered through a 120 mm 0.22 μm polyether sulfone bottle-top filter. At SE, the filtered fuel was also retained for acid-index determination. The resulting filter was quartered after sampling using a sterile scalpel, and three of these quarters were placed into individual ZR BashingBeadTM Lysis tubes containing 0.7 mL (dry volume) of 0.5 mm ZR BashingBeadTM lysis matrix (Zymo Research Corp.) and 750 μL XpeditionTM Lysis/Stabilization Solution (Zymo Research Corp.), for a total of three technical replicates per sampling. These samples were homogenized for 30 s on site using a sample cup attached to a cordless reciprocating saw, transported overnight at room temperature and stored at −20°C until needed. Prior to DNA extraction, the samples were homogenized for an additional 30 s using a BioSpec Mini-BeadBeater-8 (Biospec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK, United States). DNA extractions were performed per manufacturer specifications using the Zymo XpeditionTM Kit (Zymo Research Corp.). Libraries of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene fragments were amplified from each DNA extraction using a single set of PCR with primers that spanned the SSU rRNA gene V4/V5 hypervariable regions between position 515 and 926 (E. coli numbering) as described previously (Parada et al., 2015; Kraus et al., 2018). The primers used were selected to evenly amplify all three domains of life simultaneously (Parada et al., 2015). To mitigate the effects of contaminating DNA (Salter et al., 2014), multiple extraction blanks and negative controls were sequenced from each batch of extractions. All SSU rRNA gene libraries were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq V2 PE250 chemistry at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation.Analysis of SSU rRNA Gene Sequencing Libraries Initial quality control, demultiplexing, and OTU clustering at 97 percent sequence similarity was performed as previously described (Stamps et al., 2016), with the modification of using mothur (Schloss et al., 2009) to assign taxonomy against the SILVA database (r128) (Pruesse et al., 2007) formatted for use with mothur. Statistical analyses and figures were generated within R using Phyloseq (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013) and AmpVis (Albertsen et al., 2015). Differences in community composition were estimated using the weighted UniFrac index (Lozupone and Knight, 2005). Datasets were rarefied to 2000 sequences per sample for bacteria/archaea, and 1500 sequences per sample for the eukarya to produce ordinations and perform PERMANOVA analyses. The effect of site, tank, material, and the location of materials within each tank (top or bottom) were tested by a PERMANOVA within the R package Vegan (Dixon, 2003). Sequencing reads are available under the accessions SRR5826605-SRR5826609. The mapping file necessary for demultiplexing in QIIME is available in Supplementary Table S1.Estimation of Final Coupon Biomass The growth of biofilms within the tanks was determined by measuring the biomass attached to the polymer-coated witness coupons. After 12 months of exposure (9 months for SE 3), all pre-weighed polymer coated coupons were removed from each UST at both locations, photographed on site, placed into sterile 50 mL conical tubes, and shipped overnight for further analysis. Upon arrival, coupons were desiccated to remove any water or fuel, weighed, and then cleaned using the ASTM standard G1-03 hydrochloric acid method (G01 Committee, 2012). Briefly, coupons were sonicated for 10 min in soapy water, rinsed in deionized water, dried, and incubated in 3 M hydrochloric acid with 3.5 g/L hexamethylene tetramine solution for 10 min. Acid cleaned coupons were washed in deionized water, acetone, and methanol, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and weighed. Biomass at 12 months was estimated as the difference in the weight of the coupons prior to cleaning (after desiccation) and after cleaning. No obvious degradation of the polymer coating was observed visually before or after removal of the biofilm from sampled coupons.Microscopy and Determination of Corrosion on Witness Coupons Biofilms were visualized on undisturbed uncoated steel witness coupons (n = 2 per UST, per timepoint) by optical and electron microscopy prior to coupon cleaning. For determination of general corrosion, biofilm and corrosion products were removed from coupons (n = 5 per UST, per timepoint) via ASTM standard G1-03 C.3.5 (G01 Committee, 2012) as detailed in section “Analysis of SSU rRNA Gene Sequencing Libraries.” After cleaning, the mass of each coupon was compared to its pre-exposure mass to determine mass loss. A subset of steel witness coupons (n = 2 per time point) was imaged by several complementary approaches: SEM, confocal microscopy, and profilometry. Coupons with intact biofilms that were intended for microscopic analysis were scored with a 2 × 14 grid to enable correlation between locations imaged prior to the removal of biomass and after imaging for pitting corrosion via profilometry (each quadrant roughly 9 × 11 mm). Select coupons were then imaged with the biofilm in place using a VHX 2000E (Keyence Corp., Itasca, IL, United States) digital microscope from 20 to 200× magnification. Areas of interest were subsequently imaged using an FEI Quanta 600 environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Waltham, MA, United States). Three to five areas were imaged with SEM per coupon. Coupons designated for pitting measurement were imaged after cleaning using a VK-X250 3D Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Keyence Corp., Itasca, IL, United States) to measure the depth of each pit and surface roughness. Each coupon was imaged under 10× magnification at 42 identical locations. Maximum pitting rates (recorded as MPY) were calculated for each sample point by the formula D⁢e⁢e⁢p⁢e⁢s⁢t⁢P⁢i⁢t⁢(m⁢m)× 365E⁢x⁢p⁢o⁢s⁢u⁢r⁢e⁢T⁢i⁢m⁢e⁢(D⁢a⁢y⁢s) to calculate the rate of corrosion in mm/year and then converted to a value of MPY by multiplying the result by 39.4 (1 mm/y = 39.4 MPY). Pits were defined as a region that was a minimum of 10 μm below the mathematically determined reference plane (surface) and at least 200 μm2 in area. A Shapiro-Wilk (Shapiro and Wilk, 1965) test of normalcy (p > 0.05) was used to determine normality of the dataset, after which a non-parametric Van der Waerden test (Van Der Waerden, 1953) was used to compare field coupons to sterile controls. Multiple pairwise tests comparing in situ incubations to controls were carried out post hoc using a Conover test (Gellings and Gudger, 2012) within the package MR, and p values were corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) method (Yekutieli and Benjamini, 2001) within MR. Correlation between the presence of biofilm and corrosion was determined using coupons scored with a diamond knife to facilitate sample orientation, which were imaged by SEM and by confocal microscopy VK-X250.Tensile Testing of Polymeric Seal Materials At each time point, O-ring specimens (n = 3) were removed from each tank and the sterile controls, photographed on-site, and the accumulated biofilm was removed prior to testing. The cleaned O-rings were placed into sterile 50 ml conical tubes and shipped overnight for analysis. Tensile testing (strength and elongation) of the O-rings was conducted at the University of Dayton Research Institute in accordance with the test methods and procedures referenced in ASTM D1414 and included analyses of percent elongation, tensile strength, and maximum load.Determination of Fuel Acid Index The acid index of fuel samples taken from the bottom of tanks at the SE location was measured by acid titration using the ASTM standard D974 (D27 Committee, 2008) method at the 3, 7, and 9 months time points. Approximately 20 g of B20 suspended in 100 mL of titration solvent (100:1: 99 Toluene/Water/Isopropyl alcohol) and 0.5 mL of an indicator solution was titrated using a 0.1 N solution of KOH dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (Sigma Aldrich).Results Microbial Diversity and Taxonomic Composition Surface samples taken at each time point in each UST from coated coupons, uncoated coupons, and O-rings (representing biofilm communities), and filter quarters (representing fuel communities) were sequenced after sampling. After clustering and quality control, 3.04 million reads remained, which clustered into 759 OTUs across all three domains of life from 306 samples (Supplementary Table S2). Mean library size for Bacteria and Archaea was 6857 reads, and 3470 for the Eukarya (Supplementary Table S2). Due to low sequence count, after rarefaction 59 samples and 9 OTUs were removed from beta diversity analyses within the bacterial/archaeal dataset, while 76 samples and 29 OTUs were removed from the eukaryotic dataset. The community structure and composition of sampled biofilms varied significantly between bases (Bacteria p = 0.001; R2 = 0.12, Eukaryota p = 0.001; R2 = 0.23) and among different tanks at each base (Bacteria p = 0.001; R2 = 0.37, Eukaryota p = 0.001; R2 = 0.34). Members of the Acetobacteraceae (acetic acid bacteria) or the Clostridiaceae group 1 were the most abundant taxa detected in the tanks at SW, whereas OTUs most closely related to the genera Pannonibacter (Family Rhodobacteraceae) and Nitrospirillum (Family Rhodospirillaceae) were more abundant in SE tanks (Figure 1). An OTU (OTU 1 within the Eukaryotic dataset) that was present and often very abundant at both locations was identified as an unclassified member of the Eurotiomycetes. Additional identification via BLAST suggested that it was a filamentous fungus, most likely a member of the genus Byssochlamys (Family Trichocomaceae). The microbial communities at SE also intermittently contained a population of yeast most closely related to the genera Saccharomyces and Wickerhamomyces (Family Saccharomycetaceae) (Figure 2). A summary of all detected taxa can be found in Supplementary Table S2. FIGURE 1.

Black boxes denote that insufficient numbers of sequence were avalible to analyze for those timepoints.Ordination based on Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) using the weighted UniFrac distance among microbial communities including both fuel and biofilms indicated that these communities differed by site (Figure 3). Eukaryotic samples from SW grouped closely together visually by ordination compared to those from SE, which clustered more closely by tank rather than location (Figure 3B). Small differences were detected between samples of fuel and biofilm at each sampling point among the bacteria (Supplementary Figure S4A), but there was little to no difference among the eukarya (Supplementary Figure S4B). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Weighted UniFrac principal coordinate ordination of the Bacterial (A) and Eukaryotic (B) biofilm communities. Points are separated by location – SE (circles) and SW (triangles). Colors represent individual tanks at each location.Site Observations, Biomass, and Corrosion Measurements Total dry weight biomass after 12 months of exposure to fouled fuel was greatest at SW, with SW 2 having the greatest fouling of coupon surfaces (Supplementary Figure S5). Overall, coupons at SW were consistently coated in greater amounts of biofilm/material (Supplementary Figure S6) and had greater final biomass than those sampled at SE. A total of 242 coupons (including controls) were used in the analysis of mass loss, and 280 coupons (including controls) were used for pitting and roughness analyses between bases. The pitting analyses generated a total of 37,289 measurements from the 280 coupons and surface roughness analyses generated a total of 12,810 measurements from the 280 sampled coupons. Witness coupons from tanks at SW consistently experienced greater amounts of corrosion than those at SE (Supplementary Figure S7). All coupons exposed to SW tank systems had significantly more corrosion than controls exposed to sterile fuel. At SE both SE 3 and SE E had significantly more corrosion than controls while SE 4 coupons were not significantly different from sterile fuel controls (Supplementary Table S3). Coupons exposed to conditions in SW tanks had deeper pits than coupons from the SE location and controls (Figure 4). Over time, the skewedness of pit distribution on exposed coupons was greater than the controls (Figure 4). Surface roughness also increased over time (Supplementary Figure S8) and was the greatest on coupons from SW 2. Tanks at SW, and SE 3 had the highest pitting rate (Table 1). Corrosion rates on the bottom coupons in SW 2 and SW 4 bottom exceeded 8 MPY. Compared to coupons attached to the top of the rack, coupons placed at the bottom of tanks had deeper pits (Figure 4, p < 0.001), but surface roughness was not significantly different (p = 0.34, Supplementary Figure S8). There was little to no effect on load strength, tensile strength, or elongation among tanks of o-rings exposed to fuel at either the top or the bottom of the rack (Supplementary Figure S9). FIGURE 4.

The elevated acidity corresponded elevated corrosion rates and maximum pit depths in SE tank 3 relative to other tanks at SE. By 9 months, fuel in SE tank 3 exceeded the ASTM standard limit of 0.3 mg KOH/g B20 for fuel acidity (Table 2). Witness coupons imaged by SEM from both bases were covered by morphologically similar biofilms (Figure 5A), which were primarily comprised of fungal hyphae (Figure 5C). Pits on the coupon surfaces were correlated with areas that contained biofilm prior to cleaning (Figures 5B,D). TABLE 2.

Enhanced fuel standards have resulted in a worldwide increase in biodiesel consumption from 2.2 million liters per day (lpd) in 2000 to 84.3 million lpd in 2014 (Beiter and Tian, 2016). The USAF started using B20 biodiesel in non-emergency, non-tactical ground vehicles and consumed 12.1 million liters of biodiesel per year in 2010 (U.S. Air Force Energy Strategic Plan [USAF], 2010). A potentially significant disadvantage to their adoption of B20 biodiesel was an increase in reports of fuel biocontamination. The main objectives of this study were to characterize the microbial communities responsible for fouling of B20 biodiesel and determine whether their proliferation and biofilms are associated with increased rates of corrosion of in-service B20 storage tanks. Microorganisms can more readily metabolize the FAME in biodiesel blends, leading to fouling in fuel storage systems (Prince et al., 2008). Fuel fouling and degradation are not the only concerns, as increased rates of corrosion have been observed when microorganisms proliferate in biodiesel under laboratory conditions (Aktas et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010). A recent EPA study reported moderate or severe corrosion in 83% of inspected storage tanks (US EPA, 2016), suggesting an additional impact on fuel infrastructure could be linked to the degradation of biodiesel. Recent work has identified the metabolism of microorganisms in biodiesel blends that results in biodegradation (Bücker et al., 2018) but microbial communities in non-marine environments have not yet been directly linked to increased corrosion rates in situ. In this work, we conducted the first longitudinal study co-locating the microorganisms known to be responsible for fuel fouling, acid production, and microbially influenced corrosion on “witness” coupons installed near the bottom of tanks in situ. Our study established a link between fuel fouling and increased biofilm biomass comprised of specific fungal and bacterial taxa in operational B20 biodiesel tanks. We also linked biomass within B20 storage tanks to pitting corrosion, co-located with the microbial biofilms. The direct linkage between fuel fouling and corrosion is of considerable concern to tank operations. The most damaging MIC is associated with multispecies biofilms, where interactions between different microorganisms can create a cascade of biochemical reactions between the oxic and anoxic regions (Videla and Characklis, 1992; Little and Lee, 2014). Microbial biofilms and their associated metabolic activities can exacerbate corrosion via several mechanisms. Under anoxic conditions and in the presence of oxidized sulfur compounds, sulfur reducing microorganisms can cause corrosion of iron by either removing electrons from a hydrogen film on the metal surface (EMIC) or directly from the Fe0 itself (CMIC) (Enning et al., 2012; Venzlaff et al., 2012; Enning and Garrelfs, 2014). Very little sulfur would be expected in B20 composed of 80% ultralow sulfur diesel and no sulfate-reducing taxa were detected in our molecular analyses, supporting the conclusion that any form of MIC related to anoxic sulfur metabolism was not occurring in these tanks. Other microorganisms known to participate in CMIC, such as iron-oxidizing bacteria (e.g., Gallionella sp., Leptothrix sp., and Mariprofundus sp.) (McBeth et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017) and methanogenic archaea (Enning et al., 2012) were not detected in biofilm or fuel samples. Biofilms associated with the greatest amount of MIC in our study were composed largely of the filamentous fungus Byssochlamys sp. and acid-producing bacteria (e.g., Gluconacetobacter sp.). The Byssochlamys sp. mycelial hyphae and the biofilm itself most certainly can facilitate the partitioning of areas containing dissolved oxygen and anoxic sites, thus creating an electrochemical oxygen concentration corrosion cell (Videla and Herrera, 2005; Little et al., 2008). Areas of anoxia become anodic sites, where aggressive, localized pitting can occur. Acid production by bacteria and fungi within the biofilm cane also generate localized areas of low pH, further exacerbating the solubilization of metal from the surface (Little and Ray, 2001; Juzeliünas et al., 2007). We found that the microbial communities forming observable growth in the B20 tanks contained abundant taxa known to oxidize the fatty acids or fatty acid methyl esters present in B20 biodiesel. Limitations for growth of bacteria and fungi in B20 is likely controlled by availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, an electron acceptor, or the presence of water (i.e., physical space at the fuel-water interface). Bacterial taxa potentially capable of nitrogen fixation (Nitrospirillum and Burkholderia) were present and abundant when biomass was high. Both Nitrospirillum and Burkholderia have the capacity for nitrogen fixation and thus could be providing the greater microbial community with a source of fixed nitrogen for growth (Estrada-De Los Santos et al., 2001; Chung et al., 2015), living in coexistence with the microorganisms responsible for fuel acidification via the production of organic acids that result in corrosion of metallic surfaces within the tanks. Aerobic metabolism at the fuel:water interphase would lead to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in water at the bottom of storage tanks. In the absence of other electron acceptors, fermentation would be the main type of microbial metabolism in the water phase, leading to the production of copious organic acids. For example, members of the Firmicutes genus Caproiciproducens were abundant in SW tanks and can produce numerous organic acids including caproic, butyric, and acetic acid under anaerobic fermentative growth (Kim et al., 2015). Anaerobic, fermentative microorganisms like the Clostridiaceae (including Caproiciproducens), were also abundant at SW in all three tanks. Aerobic microorganisms, members of the Alphaproteoba cteria that are closely related to Gluconacetobacter and unclassified Acetobacteraceae, were abundant in samples from SW tanks. These microorganisms are capable of producing large quantities of acetic acid and producing viscous biofilms of cellulose, which could enhance their ability to maintain a physical presence at the fuel-water interface and exacerbate corrosion and fouling (Castro et al., 2012; Tazato et al., 2012). The presence of aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and strictly anaerobic bacteria in the tanks is indicative of the sharp gradient in oxygenation. Most likely, the bulk fuel samples taken at the bottom of storage tanks mixed these microorganisms that were otherwise segregated by fine scale gradients of oxygenated fuel and anoxic water. In contrast to the bacteria, the fungal community was less diverse and more homogenous across all locations. Fungi representing a single, highly abundant OTU closely related to the genus Byssochlamys was found in all tanks exhibiting fouling. Members of the genus Byssochlamys have been linked to the contamination of acidic fruit juices and are capable of propagating across a broad range of pH and temperatures under oxic conditions (Tournas, 2008). A member of the genus Byssochlamys was recently isolated from biodiesel in Hawaii, and characterized for its ability to degrade ULSD and biodiesel (Ye et al., 2017). Byssochlamys spores can withstand boiling (high temperatures are a part of the biodiesel production process), low concentrations of oxygen that may exist at the bottom of a fuel tank, and pH values as low as 3.5 as microbial community members begin to acidify water at the bottom of a fuel tank (Tournas, 2008). Additionally, members of the anamorph of Byssochlamys, Paecilomyces, are known to ferment under anaerobic conditions, producing acetate and ethanol (Mountfort and Rhodes, 1991). Unclassified Eurotiomycetes (identified as Byssochlamys) was numerically dominant in all tanks at SW over time with much lower observable diversity than the Bacteria. The abundance of these fungi likely contributes to the increased acidity observed in tanks at SE as well as to the acidification and fouling of fuels at SW. Filamentous fungi such as Byssochlamys may also provide a surface for bacteria to exploit, encouraging biofilm production in fuel (Guennoc et al., 2017). SEM analysis of fouled coupons showed co-location of rod-shaped bacteria with the fungal filaments (data not shown). Ours is the first study to conclusively show the biocontamination of B20 biodiesel in situ dominated by Byssochlamys-like OTUs, and to establish the relationship between their abundance and in situ corrosion. Major differences in community membership were detected between locations and among individual tanks. However, there was no obvious correlation between community membership and environmental (local temperature or rainfall) or operational variables. As a result, we do not have definitive evidence as to why specific microorganisms were associated with a single tank or location. Tank material almost certainly was a factor – corroding steel tanks represent a more reducing environment than the relatively more inert fiberglass tanks, encouraging the growth of anaerobic microorganisms such as Caproiciproducens as observed in SW. The tank SW 2 had the greatest amount of corrosion, although another steel tank, SE E, produced much lower amounts of corrosion suggesting that something more than tank material may play a role in the corrosion rate and microbial communities observed. The data presented in this study highlights the spatial heterogeneity of microbial communities within B20 storage tanks. Most of the detected taxa were found in similar relative abundances both in the top and bottom of each sampled coupon rack, suggesting there is little difference in the microbial communities that occur within these areas of each tank. The greatest differences were observed in SW 2, where differences in the relative abundances of the Clostridium sensu strictu 12 and unclassified Acetobacteraceae were noted both over time, and in position within the tank. This could be due to a decrease in the amount of dissolved oxygen both in the fuel and water bottom; OTUs related to Clostridium (strict anaerobic microorganisms) increased over time in the upper position while the Unclassified Acetobacterace decreased. Because each storage tank was in operation while it was being monitored, it is also possible that there was a mixing effect on the community as fuel and water levels changed over time, making it difficult to discern differences in community structure between locations in each tank. Shared among all of the sampled tanks, was the presence of a mixed microbial community of both fungi and bacteria that appeared capable of fermentation and the production of organic acids that would increase localized corrosion on metallic surfaces. The corrosion measured in this study likely resulted from the presence of microbial biofilms causing localized pitting corrosion. The localized production of acids within biofilms created an environment that was favorable for the induction of pitting corrosion similar to that observed within our study (Lee et al., 2010). Our in situ study showed greater corrosion near the bottom of each tank where the presence of water and a fuel-water interface was more likely. The interaction of fuel and water allows for enhanced microbial growth, and in turn, greater corrosion than water limited spaces within a fuel tank. Indeed, the greatest corrosion rates observed were in tanks at SW (>8 MPY), where fungal fouling was the most prolific. Rates of corrosion appeared to decline from 7 to 12 months, suggesting passivation may have taken place. Alternatively, the apparent shallowing of pits could be explained by an increase in uniform corrosion, that was observed in SW tanks, which could make pits appear shallower. The exact mechanism of corrosion remains to be deciphered – while steel corrosion is commonly associated with sulfate reduction and the production of sulfide (Lee et al., 2009), no sulfate reducing bacteria were identified within any of the community surveys. The greatest levels of corrosion observed in the SW tanks correlated with the presence of anaerobic Clostridia and high relative abundances of OTUs most closely related to Byssochlamys, suggesting that corrosion in these tanks was the result of the production of organic acids during the metabolism (either fermentative or aerobic) of FAMEs present within B20. The presence of organic acids produced as a consequence of fuel degradation may also aide in further growth of organisms that can directly incorporate these metabolites into their own cell wall, as was recently observed in an alkane degrading culture (Konieczna et al., 2018). Although we observed biomass including both bacterial and fungi on polymer coated coupons and polymeric O-rings that could degrade or otherwise damage materials (Cregut et al., 2013; Hung et al., 2016), polymer degradation was not detected. It is possible that the polymers tested in this study were resistant to degradation over the period of the study and that a much longer exposure time was required. Our data supports the idea that tank contamination contributes to an increased risk of corrosion but not, apparently, to polymeric degradation. We can only speculate how the fuel storage tanks became contaminated. All of the tanks sampled, with the exception of SE E, were cleaned just prior to the beginning of in situ measurements. Within 6 months, however, a dense fungal mat was visible on coupons removed from many of the tanks. Spores of Byssochlamys may enter through the vents from wind-blown dust or enter as a part of the fuel production process in otherwise “clean” fuel. Nevertheless, biofilms were repeatedly found on the in situ coupons and sampling racks near the bottom of each tank in a relatively rapid timeframe. It is highly likely that after a tank is colonized, the established community of the tank is the likely source of recurrent contamination, instead of microorganisms immigrating from air vents or water ingress.Conclusion The comprehensive, in situ investigation presented here compliments several other laboratory-based studies (Leung et al., 2006; Bucker et al., 2011; Ching et al., 2016). Together, they illustrate the susceptibility of fuels containing biodiesel to microbial proliferation (fouling), fuel biodegradation, and MIC of associated infrastructure. Here though, we were able to directly link the presence and prevalence of biofilms to pitting corrosion in actively operating B20 storage tanks. We found that a mixed microbial community of filamentous fungi and acid-producing bacteria were able to proliferate in B20 biodiesel storage tanks, cause fouling, degrade fuel by metabolizing the FAME, produce organic acids, and accelerate steel corrosion under biofilms attached to metal surfaces. The same fungal species was responsible for “blooms” of biomass, providing a target for future mitigation strategies. Additional research is underway to characterize this most abundant fungal member of fuels and biofilms observed at both locations (Stamps et al., 2018). Despite the trade-offs in fuel stability due to susceptibility to microbial attack, biodiesel continues to be the most common and economical solution to reduce the environmental impact of petroleum diesel combustion. As such, the use of biodiesel will likely continue to increase worldwide for the foreseeable future. Operator vigilance in fuel quality and storage conditions is required including early mitigation through water removal, cleaning, and even biocide treatment. Each of these methods would likely be the most effective means of controlling fouling, degradation, and corrosion through the prevention of microbial biofilm establishment. While B20 presents new storage challenges to operators, risk assessments informed by this study will aid each operator in formulating the appropriate response if contamination is detected.Data Availability Statement The raw sequence data generated for this study can be found in the Sequence Read Archive under the accession numbers SRR5826605–SRR5826609.Author Contributions BWS carried out sampling, experimentation, and wrote the manuscript.

The MAGs were not in abundance after filtration at the facility and represent a useful resource to the water treatment community at large.ABSTRACT Here, we present 95 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that harbor antimicrobial resistance genes, isolated from samples obtained in a large advanced wastewater reclamation facility prior to microfiltration. The MAGs were not in abundance after filtration at the facility and represent a useful resource to the water treatment community at large.ANNOUNCEMENT Human society faces an acceleration of water scarcity due to increasing population, pollution, and land use. Such water scarcity also brings a decrease in water quality, as demonstrated by increased eutrophication, among other concerns (1). Treatment and reuse of water are critical tools in combating water stress globally. Reuse of wastewater carries the potential risk of transmission of small-molecule metabolites and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (2), while its use relieves stress on natural sources of water. Previously, biofilms were sampled from the Orange County Water District (OCWD) Advanced Water Purification Facility (AWPF) in Southern California, which showed differences in the microbial communities in both influent and biofilms on microfiltration and reverse osmosis membranes (3). In a recent study that more fully characterized both biofilms and large volumes of water throughout the treatment process, we described both microbial diversity and load decreasing across this well-engineered system (4). Here, we have expanded and enhanced this previous work (4) by identifying metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that contain ARGs to expand our knowledge of all microbial lineages harboring ARGs that are present within an ultrapurified water facility. Water and biofilm were sampled at the OCWD AWPF as previously described (4). Briefly, all water samples were filtered using a large-volume concentrator (LVC) dialysis filter cartridge system (Innova Prep LLC, Drexel, MO). Approximately 60 to 100 liters of water were filtered per sample, prior to concentration onto replicate 25-mm (diameter), 0.22-μm (pore size) nitrocellulose filters. Filters were placed in BashingBead lysis tubes (Zymo, Inc., Irvine, CA) containing 750 μl of DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo, Inc.) to preserve samples onsite. Biofilm samples were similarly placed in lysis tubes with DNA/RNA Shield. DNA was extracted using the Zymo Microbiomics DNA/RNA coextraction kit (Zymo, Inc.). Libraries were prepared as previously described in full (4) using the Nextera XT library prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), modified to use 13 cycles of PCR. All samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 instrument using PE150 chemistry. Two biofilm samples from filtration units at the AWPF obtained from Leddy et al. (3) were processed as described previously and sequenced using SE100 chemistry. Sequence reads were error corrected using BayesHammer v3.12.0 (5) and assembled using MEGAHIT v1.1.3 (6) to produce a single coassembly. Reads were mapped to the assembly with Bowtie 2 v2.3.4.1 (7) and binned into MAGs using Anvi’o v v5 and CONCOCT (8, 9). MAG completion and redundancy estimates were also computed within Anvi’o. MAGs were queried for ARGs using DeepARG (10) and identified phylogenetically by GTDB-Tk v0.3.0 (11). Default parameters were used for all software unless otherwise noted. A total of 95 MAGs were selected after manual curation within Anvi’o and by DeepARG that contained 185 open reading frames putatively identified as antimicrobial resistance genes. Of note, two MAGs were identified by GTDB-Tk as belonging to the “Candidatus Gracilibacteria” and “Candidatus Patescibacteria” lineages (12). Others identified included an unclassified Dongiaceae MAG that was previously associated with a wastewater treatment facility (13). A more detailed list of assembly statistics and taxonomy of all MAGs can be found in Table 1. As reported previously, no metagenomic sequence and therefore no MAGs were identified after barrier filtration within the system due to a lack of sufficient extractable or amplifiable DNA (4). Future work will further describe the ARGs and will identify non-ARG-containing MAGs and determine how they impact the operation of the OCWD AWPF. TABLE 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Simple Summary Earthquakes are invariably preceded by a period when stresses increase deep in the Earth. Animals appear to be able to sense impending seismic events. During build-up of stress, electronic charge carriers are activated deep below, called positive holes. Positive holes have unusual properties: they can travel fast and far into and through the surrounding rocks. As they flow, they generate ultralow frequency electromagnetic waves. When they arrive at the Earth surface, they can ionize the air. When they flow into water, they oxidize it to hydrogen peroxides. All these physical and chemical processes can have noticeable effects on animals.Abstract Earthquakes occur when tectonic stresses build up deep in the Earth before catastrophic rupture. During the build-up of stress, processes that occur in the crustal rocks lead to the activation of highly mobile electronic charge carriers. These charge carriers are able to flow out of the stressed rock volume into surrounding rocks. Such outflow constitutes an electric current, which generates electromagnetic (EM) signals. If the outflow occurs in bursts, it will lead to short EM pulses. If the outflow is continuous, the currents may fluctuate, generating EM emissions over a wide frequency range. Only ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) waves travel through rock and can reach the Earth surface. The outflowing charge carriers are (i) positively charged and (ii) highly oxidizing. When they arrive at the Earth surface from below, they build up microscopic electric fields, strong enough to field-ionize air molecules. As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress hormone levels in animals and humans. In addition to the ULF/ELF emissions, positive airborne ions can cause unusual reactions among animals. When the charge carriers flow into water, they oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide. This, plus oxidation of organic compounds, can cause behavioral changes among aquatic animals.Keywords: pre-earthquake phenomena, positive holes, ULF (ultralow frequency) waves, ELF (extremely low frequency) waves, air ionization, water oxidation, hydrogen peroxide, physiological effects",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Earthquakes are caused by the build-up of tectonic stresses. When rocks reach a critical limit, catastrophic failure occurs, causing a rupture to propagate, sometimes over distances of hundreds of kilometers, with typical speeds in the range of 2.2–3 km/s—supersonic with respect to the speed of sound in air. The rupture generates shockwaves in the Earth that spread at speeds of about 6 km/s for the compressional (P) waves and about 3.4 km/s for the more destructive shear (S) waves. An earthquake of magnitude 7 releases an energy equivalent to that of more than 2000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs. The magnitude scale being exponential, the energy released by a magnitude 9 earthquake is equivalent to more than 2,000,000 A-bombs. Mainstream seismology, as currently practiced, focuses on understanding earthquakes from a mechanistic viewpoint using information collected by the analysis of past earthquakes to predict future earthquakes [1,2,3]. Unfortunately, even if the database for past events is very large, counting thousands, even tens of thousands, the prediction of any single future earthquake is subject to the large uncertainty, which is an inescapable corollary of statistics of small numbers. For this reason seismological prediction models are typically given with uncertainty windows on the order of decades, even centuries. Only in very few cases have predictions been attempted with quoted uncertainty windows of only a few years [3,4]. Seismologists are of course aware of these statistical limitations. This is why their majority believes that earthquakes are inherently unpredictable [5,6]. In view of the enormously large amounts of mechanical energy released by major seismic events, however, it is inconceivable—from a physics perspective—that the Earth would not produce some identifiable non-seismic and non-mechanical signals prior to such large-scale catastrophic events. Whether or not, and to what extent, the precursory signals are reliable is another question. There have been countless accounts of precursory signals, too many to list here. They span a bewildering diversity of phenomena ranging from stories of unusual animal behavior on land, in the air and in the water, to the emission of electromagnetic radiation over many orders of frequency space, to distinct changes in the electron distribution at the lower edge of the ionosphere some 100–300 km above the surface of the Earth, and many others. The problem facing earthquake forecasting is not that there has been a lack of reported pre-earthquake (pre-EQ) phenomena. The real problem lies in the lack of understanding what the different types of reported pre-EQ phenomena mean and how they might be generated. There have also been countless attempts to interpret pre-EQ signals and to assign them to known physical processes that could occur in the Earth crust in response to the build-up of tectonic stresses. The problem is that the reported pre-EQ phenomena are so diverse and fall into the competency range of so many different scientific disciplines that it has not been possible, so far, to reach any consensus. If such a situation arises, namely that scientists from different disciplines cannot agree on a scientific explanation of a set of naturally occurring phenomena such as pre-EQ phenomena, chances are that the physical underpinning of the processes in the Earth crust during the build-up of tectonic stresses are not yet properly understood. This is particularly relevant to the contentious issue of unusual pre-EQ animal behavior reported in the scientific and non-scientific literature. 1.1. Setting the Stage Earthquakes are usually reported in terms of the location of their epicenter, their magnitude, and their depth. The hypocenter is defined as the point at depth, where the rupture starts. The epicenter is the point on the Earth surface straight above the hypocenter. Most major crustal earthquakes occur in the 7–35 km depth range. At this depth the isostatic overload is substantial, ranging from about 2,000 kg/cm2 to 10,000 kg/cm2, 2–10 metric tons on every square centimeter. Under these conditions it is highly questionable whether two processes, which are widely quoted in the context of pre-EQ signals, can in fact take place: (i) microfracturing and (ii) the electrokinetic effect. Microfracturing had been introduced in the late 1960s as part of the “Dilatancy theory” [7,8], which started with the observation that, when rock cylinders are uniaxially stressed, they bulge out and that their total volume increases [9,10,11,12]. In unconstrained rock cylinders such volume increase is due to internal cracks opening as a result of the applied stress. However, deep in the Earth crust, under the isostatic load of tens of kilometers of rock, the opening of cracks or microfractures is unlikely because the attendant volume increase has to perform work against a very large overload. Rocks in the upper reaches of the Earth crust, from zero to about 5–7 km, have non-zero porosity. The pores are water-filled or brine-filled. They often communicate, allowing the fluids to flow along stress gradients. Such fluid flow leads to separation of charges because cations tend to be retained on the walls of pores and narrow channels, while anions are carried along with the flow. This is the electrokinetic effect. The resulting potential, the “streaming potential”, produces voltage signals, which have been invoked to explain geoelectric and electromagnetic signals recorded prior to major earthquakes [13,14,15,16]. However, streaming potentials can only be produced in the most shallow crust, where rocks are porous but where earthquakes do not typically occur. Nonetheless microfracturing and the electrokinetic effect have been invoked in the context of unusual pre-EQ animal behavior. A third process frequently quoted in the context of pre-EQ phenomena is emanation of radon gas from the ground. Radioactive 222Rn, which has a half-life of 2.8 days and decays via emission of a 507 MeV alpha particle into polonium 218Po, is a product of the uranium-radium decay chain. Changes in pre-EQ radon emanation have long been reported [17,18,19]. Each alpha particle emitted during radon decay creates about 105 electron-ion pairs along its path, forming a narrow plasma channel, about 1 cm long in air. A small fraction of these electron-ion pairs escape recombination and, hence, lead to an increase in air conductivity. This air conductivity increase has been claimed to be responsible for a number of pre-EQ phenomena including animal behavior [20]. The idea is that, if changes in radon emanation are due to microfracturing, animals might possess unusual capabilities to detect the faint vibrations from microfracturing in the near-surface environment. Much of what has been said and written about pre-EQ phenomena can be traced back to the seismology and its reliance on mechanical concepts. Microfracturing, for instance, is based on the assumption that pre-EQ stresses can be transmitted laterally from the hypocenter over long distances defined as “earthquake preparation zone” where the radius r is given by the relation r = 100.43M, M the magnitude and r the distance in kilometers [21]. For a magnitude 7 earthquake r would be 1,000 km. Such large EQ preparation zones and the assumed lateral stress transfer are inconsistent with other reports that pre-EQ stress changes are seldom detected, even with most sensitive strain gauges [22,23,24,25,26]. The electrokinetic effect is likewise based on mechanical concepts, namely that stress gradients provide the driving force for fluid flow through porous rocks, which in turn would generate electric signals. Fluctuations in the flow rate are then expected to lead to low frequency electromagnetic emissions [14]. Many other attempts to find explanations for reported pre-EQ phenomena also rely on mechanical concepts inherited from seismology. 1.2. Shifting Paradigm Largely unnoticed by the mainstream geoscience community, work over the past 3½ decades has led to crucial insight into non-seismic pre-EQ signals. The original goal of this work was to characterize inconspicuous defects in minerals: pairs of oxygen anions that have changed their valence from the common oxidation state 2- to the more oxidized state 1-. These so-called peroxy defects occur in the matrix of silicate minerals in igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks—rocks that form the bulk of the Earth’s crust over the seismogenic depth range [27,28]. Examples of peroxy defects are O3Si-OO-SiO3 bonds replacing Si-O-Si bonds in mineral structures. The peroxy bonds are introduced through the dissolution of small amounts of “water” into minerals that crystallize from magma or recrystallize in deep high-temperature environments. The H2O molecules that enter into the solid state turn into “impurity” hydroxyls, O3Si-OH: O3Si-O-SiO3 + H2O ⬄ O3Si-OH HO-SiO3 (1) Upon cooling, when diffusional processes freeze and thermodynamic equilibrium can no longer be maintained, the O3Si-OH pairs undergo a redox conversion: O3Si-OH HO-SiO3 ⬄ O3Si-OO-SiO3 + H2 (2) This is a classical redox conversion, unusual only in the sense that the electron transfer involves hydroxyl oxygens donating an electron to their protons, reducing them to H. Two H combine to H2, while the oxygens, now oxidized to the valence state 1-, combine to form peroxy. The O−–O− bond in O3Si-OO-SiO3 is very short, only 1.5 Å, about half the distance between normal neighboring O2− anions. The shortness makes the peroxy bonds susceptible to the perturbations such as the slightest sliding of mineral grains during the build-up of stress, causing O3Si-OO-SiO3 bonds to break. The broken peroxy bonds split off electronic charge carriers, chemically O− in a matrix of O2−, physically defect electrons in the O2− sublattice, known as positive holes and symbolized by h•. The h• are highly mobile and have the capability to flow out of the stressed rock volume deep in the Earth crust, where a rock rupture may soon occur. The h• flow out into the surrounding rocks. They travel fast and far, tens of kilometers, possibly hundreds of kilometers prior to large earthquakes. They form electric currents in the Earth crust, sometimes hundreds of thousands of amperes strong [29]. When these currents fluctuate, they emit electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The ultralow frequency (ULF) components of these EM waves can be transmitted through tens of kilometers of rocks and detected at the Earth surface. Likewise the attenuation of ULF and ELF waves through ocean water is weak. Hence, the effects discussed here would also apply to cases where earthquakes occur offshore. When h• charge carriers arrive at the Earth surface or cross from the solid Earth into water, they cause a variety of reactions, physical and chemical. How these reactions express themselves in the surface environment is of interest in the context of animal response and the topic of this report.",

Statements like this, however, are understandable, if one takes into consideration that the majority of the ICEF members are seismologists who tend to look at pre-EQ animal responses from the mechanical perspective of mainstream seismology. This prevailing attitude makes it difficult, if not impossible, to recognize the complexity of the interactions between animals and the physical world. The real problem is not the absence of observationally well-documented facts about unusual animal behavior but a lack of understanding how the reported non-seismic pre-EQ phenomena are generated in the natural environments, and what are the non-seismic stimuli to which animals appear to respond. The discovery of positive hole charge carriers, h•, has led to insights into the physical processes that occur deep in the Earth crust during the build-up of high levels of stress and into the range of unusual properties that seem to be characteristic of these previously unrecognized electronic charge carriers in rocks [28]. The purpose of our paper is to draw attention to the fact that, during build-up of stresses—but before catastrophic rupture—an activation of h• charge carriers takes place in rocks that form the deeper layers of the Earth crust. This is a non-seismic process that takes place during every episode of waxing stress in the Earth crust regardless of whether or not the rocks will rupture catastrophically. Stress-activation of h• charge carriers, a quintessential pre-EQ phenomenon, is essential to all non-seismic pre-EQ phenomena mentioned in this paper.

Upon arrival at the ground-to-water interface they can act as highly oxidizing •O radicals and oxidize H2O to H2O2.

    "conclusion": "4. Conclusions A previously unknown or overlooked physical process takes place in rocks that are subjected to large stresses deep below in the Earth crust before major earthquakes. This process leads to the activation of electronic charge carriers, which can spread out of the stressed rock volume into the surrounding rocks, traveling fast and far. They generate electromagnetic waves, of which the ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) portion can be transmitted through rocks. The ULF and ELF waves have the capacity to interact with living organisms and to interfere with fundamental biochemical reactions at the cellular level. When the charge carriers arrive at the ground-to-air interface, they are able to ionize the air producing—under certain conditions—exclusively positive airborne ions. Such positive airborne ions are known to have pronounced and generally detrimental physiological effects. When these charge carriers arrive at the water-to-air interface, they oxidize the water and possibly organic compounds dissolved in the water, producing potentially hazardous toxins. Understanding the complex sequence of events taking place in the Earth crust during the lead-up to major earthquakes provides insight into the causes of unusual pre-earthquake animal behavior.",

Copyright notice ID: 4494396 PMID: 26487415 Abstract Simple Summary Earthquakes are invariably preceded by a period when stresses increase deep in the Earth. Animals appear to be able to sense impending seismic events. During build-up of stress, electronic charge carriers are activated deep below, called positive holes. Positive holes have unusual properties: they can travel fast and far into and through the surrounding rocks. As they flow, they generate ultralow frequency electromagnetic waves. When they arrive at the Earth surface, they can ionize the air. When they flow into water, they oxidize it to hydrogen peroxides. All these physical and chemical processes can have noticeable effects on animals.Abstract Earthquakes occur when tectonic stresses build up deep in the Earth before catastrophic rupture. During the build-up of stress, processes that occur in the crustal rocks lead to the activation of highly mobile electronic charge carriers. These charge carriers are able to flow out of the stressed rock volume into surrounding rocks. Such outflow constitutes an electric current, which generates electromagnetic (EM) signals. If the outflow occurs in bursts, it will lead to short EM pulses. If the outflow is continuous, the currents may fluctuate, generating EM emissions over a wide frequency range. Only ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) waves travel through rock and can reach the Earth surface. The outflowing charge carriers are (i) positively charged and (ii) highly oxidizing. When they arrive at the Earth surface from below, they build up microscopic electric fields, strong enough to field-ionize air molecules. As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress hormone levels in animals and humans.

How these reactions express themselves in the surface environment is of interest in the context of animal response and the topic of this report. 2. Pre-Earthquake Processes and the Biosphere Reports on unusual animal behavior before major earthquakes are innumerable, some dating back to antiquity. Because so little is known about the nature of the physical or chemical clues to which animals appear to respond, there is a strong tendency in some scientific circles to dismiss the reports and call them “anecdotal”. However, if similar observations, often strikingly similar, have been reported across centuries by people living on different continents, in different seismically active regions, a reasonable argument can be made that these reports are not just “anecdotal”. Since they are validated by multiple independent observations, they suggest the presence of physical and/or chemical stimuli in the environment, to which animals respond. For moderate to large earthquakes the Earth appears to produce these stimuli within a time window of about two weeks to one day, sometimes only a few hours, before the event. For magnitude 9-class earthquakes the time window could be wider. 2.1. The Effect of Electromagnetic Waves on Organismal Physiology Exposure to electromagnetic waves can have physiological effects on a wide variety of organisms [30]. Importantly, the physiological effects can be induced by exposure to the level of EM energy in the thermal noise, which helps to explain the challenge in analytical detection of earthquake precursors in the EM spectrum. For example, one of the most astonishing effects of extremely low amplitude EM oscillating field, even when the magnetic flux of such field is below the thermal noise (i.e., nanoTesla field), is to change the electron precession, or spin, in universally conserved biochemical reactions that coordinate genome expression to maintain circadian timing. The cryptochrome proteins, which maintain the circadian rhythm, also show high sequence similarity to universally conserved proteins that maintain genome integrity by repair of oxidation-damaged DNA [31]. Such weak EM fields tuned in frequency to the rate of electron spin (i.e., MHz) have been shown to cause aberrant growth of cells and disorientation with respect to the magnetic and gravity vectors in various organisms, including plants and animals [32]. Therefore, the universal time-setting basis of invariant biochemical reactions can be an EM field in the thermal noise. Additionally, there have been many studies over several decades reporting on significant physical, biological and health-related effects associated with changes in solar and geomagnetic activity. The changes in solar and geomagnetic activity lead to changes in the ambient extremely low frequency (ELF) and the ultralow frequency (ULF) field at the Earth surface, specifically to the immersion of the Earth surface environment into broadband EM field (0.1–50 Hz), which can be the causal link between these changes in the ambient ELF field, both under pre-earthquake conditions and during geomagnetic storms [33], and the various effects noted in the biosphere. However, despite decades of research in characterizing the effects of non-ionizing EM radiation on organismal physiology, including in humans, the results often seem to be inconsistent or difficult to interpret. For example, some experimental studies claim a direct effect of ELF on metabolism [30], while theoretical studies dispute the possibility of such effects based on first principles [34]. Additionally, the international guidelines for limiting exposure to time-varying electric and magnetic fields in the low-frequency range consider ULF and ELF EM fields to be biologically relevant only, if their amplitudes exceed the ambient field of about 40 pT by at least 109 times (i.e., in excess of 0.01 T magnetic flux density) [35]. How can this discrepancy in empirical evidence be reconciled without dismissing the potential importance of modulating organismal physiology with EM fields, while remaining in accord with physical principles? It is important to recognize that EM waves are time-dependent phenomena and their effects on temporally organized biochemical cycles in living cells, such as the reduction oxidation cycle, can generate quite opposite effects depending upon their phase relationships. The redox cycle, also called the metabolic cycle, is the fundamental biochemical process that controls the timing of all biochemical reactions in living cells, including energy production, RNA transcription, and DNA replication. Through temporal coordination a chemical conflict between the reductive and oxidative reactions is avoided, while at the same time a coherent or interfering transfer of energy is enabled between the ambient natural electromagnetic (EM) field and living cells. The interaction between EM waves and electron transport in redox reactions clearly depends on the phase relationship between oscillating systems. Therefore, whether or not ambient non-ionizing EM fields are able to affect biological processes in organisms can be very sensitive to resonance, which occurs when the organismal physiology is able to transfer energy from ambient EM field in tune with the electromotive force across membranes. An appropriate experimental approach to reconcile the inconsistencies in the effects of EM field on organismal physiology is to identify the point of resonance between the time-setting basis of ambient EM waves in the environment and the phase of the biochemical reduction oxidation cycle in the electron transport chain (ETC) in vivo. Clearly, animals including birds and turtles can detect the Earth’s magnetic field, and use the field to navigate during migration [36]. For example, the Bar-tailed Godwit bird has one of the longest non-stop migrations of any species, up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi). Magnetic perception can also account for the behavior of cows and wild deer that tend to align their bodies north-south direction while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high voltage power lines that generate ELF electromagnetic fields, which disrupt the magnetic alignment of ruminants [37,38]. Although the geomagnetic field is weak and is generally thought to be masked by thermal fluctuations and other noise, the proposed bio-physical mechanism for magneto perception is based on coherent quantum effects of extremely weak magnetic fields on the electron spin in each of radical pair intermediates of molecules in redox reactions [32]. Depending on the electron spin state, different reaction products are produced, and at different rates. The switch between the products of the redox reactions is shifted by the ambient EM field, which can affect the organismal behavior [32]. These results indicate that the rates and direction of electron transfer reactions—the rate at which an electron can move or jump from one chemical species (called the electron donor) to another (called the electron acceptor)—are subject to ambient EM field influences. This process of electron transport in vivo is fundamental to all organisms because it is biochemically coupled with the transfer of H+ ions (protons) across a membrane. The resulting electrochemical proton gradient is used to generate chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Importantly, the universal ETC is made from components (such as iron oxides, e.g., heme) with a strong magnetic moment that increases the effect of the weak ambient EM field [32]. Intriguingly, the rotation frequency of the molecular enzyme motor called ATP synthase, which synthesizes ATP also oscillates at ELF (10–70 Hz) [39]. Consequently, thermodynamic coupling by EM resonance is possible between the ambient EM field and the most fundamental biochemical process of life. Although the energy and geometric scale of external EM waves and the energy and dimensions of the ATP synthase enzyme motor differ by at least 12 orders of magnitude, it is to be noted that, due to quantum mechanical delocalization of electronic wave functions, the ATP synthase has the capability to extract EM energy from a volume much larger than the volume, which itself occupies [40,41]. This astonishing physical phenomenon allows the systems to exceed—through athermal mechanisms—the limit on EM radiation with intensity less than 10 mW/cm2 thought to be unlikely to significantly affect physiology. In addition, it is important to note that pausing the rotation of ATP synthase, or changing the direction of its rotation, leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to the depletion of ATP, respectively. Both biochemical events result in metabolic stress in vivo (e.g., oxidative stress) that can conceivably account for anomalous animal behavior. Therefore, organisms are likely able to detect earthquake-induced variations in the ambient EM field because EM perturbations can affect the time-setting physical basis for the known universal biochemical order in living cells [42]. 2.2. Surface/Subsurface Charges, Air Ionization, and Corona Discharges Positive holes are positive charge carriers. As h• travel through the rocks, they repel each other and “try to get away from each other” as far as possible. The surface of the Earth is as the furthest they can go. The h• become trapped at the surface, forming a subsurface charge layer of thickness d, where d is typically only a few ten nanometers. This charge layer is characterized by a surface potential V, typically on the order of 2–3 V [43]. As rocks become ever more stressed by the tectonic forces deep below, the more h• charge carriers are generated. The more h• charge carriers arrive at the surface, the more they compress the subsurface charge layer so the d decreases. The electric field E is defined as potential V divided by the thickness d, E = V/d. If V is, say, 2 V and the thickness of the h• subsurface charge layer is 40 nm (4 × 10−7 cm), the E field at the surface will be on the order of 5,000,000 V/cm. As laboratory experiments demonstrate, air molecules, presumably O2, can become field-ionized under these conditions, meaning that they become so highly polarized in contact with the ground that they lose an electron to the surface: O−|surface + O2|air => O2−|surface + O2+|air (3) When this process sets in, the near-surface air becomes laden with positive airborne ions. It has been shown experimentally that, when a block of rock is mechanically stressed at one end, the air at the other end becomes indeed positively ionized [43]. The number of positive ions can reach values on the order of 106 cm−2 s−1. This is much higher than the “fair weather” ion content in normal air [44]. Field data recorded by air ionization sensors collocated with the ULF search coil magnetometers of the QuakeFinder stations along the San Andreas Fault system in California and along the subduction zone in southern Peru have confirmed massive, positive, pre-EQ ionization of air and coincident EM pulses [45,46]. It is important to note that the ions generated by the mechanism described by Equation (3) are all positive. Positive airborne ions have been known for a long time to have a strong physiological effect on animals and humans [47,48]. Therefore it should not come as a surprise that animals in the ground, on the ground and in the air would respond to high positive airborne ion concentrations in their environment. When stresses continue to increase, the voltages associated with the surface/subsurface charge layer increase further and d is further reduced. If the voltage V reaches, say, 3 V, and the thickness becomes 6 nm, the E field will reach values on the order of 50,000,000 V/cm. This is enough to accelerate electrons in the air, which are always present due to cosmic ray and other ionization events, to such high values that they begin to impact-ionize neutral air molecules, triggering tiny corona discharges. Importantly these corona discharges produce avalanches of electrons and positive ions in the air. The free electrons will attach themselves rapidly to neutral air molecules such as N2, forming negative airborne ions such as N2–. In addition the corona discharges produce tiny light flashes with a broad emission spectrum over the VIS and UV regions [43]. The UV component of these flashes can be expected to produce ozone, O3, and other reactive gases such as nitrous oxides, to which animals may respond [49]. 2.3. Oxidizing Water to Hydrogen Peroxide at the Rock-Water Interface From a physics perspective h• are charge carriers, i.e., defect electrons on the oxygen anion sublattice, but from a chemistry perspective they are O–, equivalent to •O radicals and highly oxidizing. When h• cross the rock-to-water interface, they oxidize H2O to H2O2: O−|surface + H2O|liquid => OH−|surface + •OH|liquid (4) Two •OH combine to form H2O2. The reaction is stoichiometric [50]. The formation of H2O2 at the rock-water interface, presumably also at mud-water interfaces, due to the arrival of h• charge carriers flowing down a stress gradient prior to a not-too-distant earthquake can be expected to have some effect on animals living in the water. During a multi-year study of the spring mating behavior of the European toad Bufo bufo in the San Ruffino Lake, central Italy, about 75 km from L’Aquila, it was noted that the toads disappeared from their mating and spawning ground starting about 5 days before the magnitude 6.3 L’Aquila earthquake of April 6, 2009, and did not return until a series of aftershocks had subsided [51]. While it has been suggested that animals may have acquired, through evolution, the ability to take evasive action before potentially deadly earthquakes [52], in the case of the toads in Lake San Ruffino near L’Aquila their pre-EQ departure from the aquatic environment was more likely triggered by chemical clues in the water such as the release of H2O2 and possibly other oxidation products resulting from an influx of h• [51]. Humboldt squid stranding are not rare events. In late 2012 several massive strandings of mostly juvenile Humboldt squids occurred on the shores of Monterey Bay in Northern California [53]. In this case the strandings appeared to coincide with red algae blooms. Certain red algae can produce the potent neurotoxin domoic acid, a derivative of the cyclic amino acid proline, which deregulates the Ca balance in nerve cells [54]. Domoic acid accumulates in the marine food chain. It can be harmful, even lethal, to sea mammals and sea birds, and it can also affect squids, which feed on fish that have fed on domoic acid-producing red algae [55]. There have been reports on squid strandings ostensibly related to earthquakes. One particular case involved a modest magnitude 4.0 earthquake that struck July 14, 2009 at 7:34 am local time about 35 km offshore near La Jolla, San Diego, CA at a depth of about 20 km. Many large mature Humboldt squids washed up on the shore on the same day, dazed and dying [56]. William Gilly, Stanford University Hopkins Marine Station, reported that strandings of the same species had been seen along the same stretch of the Pacific coast during the last three days prior to the earthquake. Humboldt squids typically live at 100 m water depth and deeper. If a red algae bloom is an unlikely cause, the question arises whether something might have happened at the ground-water interface, which displaced these squids. One possibility would be that, during the influx of h• into the water column at the ground-water interface, oxidation reactions occur in addition to the simple H2O2 production as described by Equation (4). These additional reactions could lead to enhanced degradation of organic compounds in the sea bottom mud or in the near-ground water [57] possibly converting benign compounds to neurotoxins such as domoic acid or to other compounds, which might be toxic to specific groups of animals. Further work will be needed to address the complexity of the electrochemically driven oxidation reactions at the ground-to-water interface caused by the influx of stress-activated h• charge carriers from below. 2.4. Oxidation Reactions in the Soil 2.4.1. Ozone There have been many reports on major gas and trace gas emanation related to earthquake activity. Most commonly there is an increase in the efflux of CO2, or in the efflux of CO2, H2, N2, He, Ar, CH4, often with isotopic signatures suggesting an upper mantle origin [58]. In the context of pre-EQ animal responses these gases can probably be disregarded, but some other trace gases may be more relevant such as ozone, O3. A rise in the ozone levels during or after large earthquakes has been reported and interpreted as due to cracking of rocks at or near the surface with attendant formation of ozone through fracture-induced electric discharges [49]. However, there is also a report for a noticeable rise in ozone levels days before major earthquakes, when surface or near near-surface fracturing of rocks could not have occurred. Figure 1 shows the average of regional ozone levels 5 days before to 4 days after 88 strong earthquakes of magnitudes 4.5 to 7.2 that occurred in Central Asia from 1973 to 1985 [59]. The data were collected at fixed ground stations often hundreds of km from the epicenters. The measured O3 concentrations, given in Dobson units, represent variations that must have been observable over large regions. On the average, for the 88 reported events, elevated O3 contents are observed 2–4 days before with a maximum 3 days before these earthquakes. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Ozone level changes associated with 88 strong earthquakes of magnitudes 4.5–7.2 in Central Asia from 1973 to 1985 (solid line) [59]. A Dobson unit is the column density of O3 in Earth atmosphere equivalent to a 10 µm thick layer of O3 under standard temperature and pressure. Dotted line: average O3 values during non-perturbed days; Dashed lines: 95% confidence level.By plotting the O3 concentration in Dobson units Figure 1 gives the total O3 content throughout the atmosphere. Most of it, of course, refers to the O3 layer. Its variability is indicated by the two dashed lines for the 95% confidence level. The “high” 3 days before the earthquakes and the “low” on the day of the earthquakes represent local sources, presumably near the ground level. The laboratory experiments mentioned above had indicated that, when we stressed rocks up to failure, we observed first exclusively positive airborne ions and second a mixture of positive and negative airborne ions in about equal numbers. This second step arose from corona discharges at the edges and corners of the rock samples [43]. If we apply these findings to situations in the field we expect that, prior to large earthquakes, massive amounts of positive airborne ions would be emitted from the Earth surface around the epicentral region, followed by tiny corona discharges spreading over an equally wide region. Though the light emitted by those tiny corona discharges will probably be too weak to be noticed by the naked eye during daytime, these corona discharges can be expected to lead to ozone formation. The data reproduced in Figure 1 are consistent with this second step. In addition, co-seismic emissions of light flashes have been recorded in real-time during a recent nighttime major earthquake in Peru [60]. Animals exposed to both steps, to massive positive air ionization and ozone production at ground level, can be expected to exhibit abnormal behavior in response to the appearance of these irritants in their environment at higher levels than normal. In the case of positive air ions the response of animals could be triggered by their effect on the seratonin level in the blood, a stress hormone, [48]. Ozone, a trace gas with an acrid smell even at concentration levels as low as 40 nmol/mol or 40 ppb, is recognized by the US Environmental Protection Agency as an inflammatory agent through induction of oxidative stress [61]. 2.4.2. Radon Another trace gas is radon, which emanates from the ground due to the radioactive decay of radium, an element in the uranium decay series and found in relative highest concentrations in granites and similar igneous rocks, which form the bulk of the Earth crust. The radium isotope 226Ra decays by alpha particle emission to 222Ra, which itself is radioactive, decaying through the emission of 507 MeV alpha particles to the polonium isotope 218Po [62]. 222Ra has a half-life of 2.8 days. Radon is a noble gas and widely thought to be chemically inert, released from the ground only because, prior to major earthquakes, microfracturing is supposed to occur in the near-surface underground. This is the usual mechanical concept inherited from seismology, where cracks are believed to open in the rocks, releasing gases. However, because radon is the heaviest of the noble gases, it must be chemically reactive, even more so than xenon, forming compounds with soil organics. Therefore, on its diffusion path from below to the surface through the overlying soil, radon atoms are expected to be retained due to chemisorption to soil organics. The most likely retention sites would be triple-bonded carbon compounds in the soil, forming R-Rn-C≡C-H (with R being -CH3 etc.) similar to the stable Xe analog H-Xe-C≡C-H [63]. If this is the right concept, the arrival of h• charge carriers in the soil layer over regions of impending earthquake activity will preferentially attack the triple carbon bonds, oxidize them to double or single bonds, and thereby release the radon [64]. The radon atoms would then be free to continue their diffusional path to the surface, where they enter the air space. It is true that, besides cosmic rays, radon decay in the near-surface air is the main source of the ambient air ionization accounting for about 200 ion pairs per cm3 air at sea level [65]. Modest changes in the rate at which radon escapes from the ground have been widely reported in relation to pre-EQ activity [17,18,19,20]. However, while radon in the near-surface air surely has an impact on all living organisms through radiation damage to their genes, there is little or no evidence that changes in the rate of radon release and the ensuing changes in the ion concentration in the near-surface air can be sensed by animals and could have an effect on pre-EQ animal behavior. 2.4.3. Carbon Monoxide There are other forms of oxidation reactions, which a pre-EQ influx of h• charge carriers into the soil layer can cause and which could incite an animal response. There is, for instance, a well-documented case where carbon monoxide (CO) was massively released from the ground prior to the magnitude 7.6 Gujurat earthquake of January 26, 2001 in North-West India. Using data collected by the MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere) sensor onboard the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite, Singh et al. [66] retrieved the CO concentrations in the atmospheric column over a 3-month period that included the time of the Gujurat earthquake. The Terra satellite passes over the region twice a day at 705 km altitude, once during daytime and once at night. It can provide CO concentration values with a horizontal resolution of 22 km and a precision of about 10%. CO profiles can be obtained in the absence of substantial cloud cover. The Gujurat results are shown in Figure 2. The CO concentration values represent averages for a 1° × 1° area (approximately 100 × 100 km2). The CO profile is broken down into 7 altitude windows as indicated in the insert, from 0 up to 110 m, up to about 1,500 m, up to about 3000 m, and higher. The data show that the regional background CO concentration was always highest close to the ground, i.e., in the lowest altitude window, with values between 100 and 150 ppb. However, starting probably more than a week before the magnitude 7.6 seismic event, the CO concentration increased, reaching a maximum on January 19, 2001 around 240 ppbv in the air below 110 m. The total amount of CO in the air column would be enough to reach 500 ppm near the surface, a potentially lethal concentration because CO induces phase advancement into the oxidative respiratory phase of the metabolic cycle in all aerobic organisms. Indeed, CO acts in a manner similar to cyanide by binding to the heme in cytochrome c oxidase and inhibits electron transport and ATP production, which leads to an increased ROS production. This fundamental and universal mechanism of CO-induced ROS production during the redox cycle applies to all aerobic cells [67]. Therefore, a pre-EQ influx of h• charge carriers into the soil layer can cause gaseous CO release, which functions as a cellular signaling molecule that attenuates metabolic cycling toward stress (i.e., oxidative damage in living cells). Figure 2. Open in a new tab CO concentration values representing averages for a 1° × 1° area (approximately 100 × 100 km2) around the epicenter of the Gujurat earthquake of January 26, 2001. The CO profile is broken down into the 7 altitude windows indicated in the insert.The increased CO emanation from the ground indeed suggests a chemical reaction involving stress-activated h• charge carriers, flooding the soil layer in the epicentral region from below. Being highly mobile, highly reactive and highly oxidizing these h• can be expected to “burn” organic matter in the soil. Taking -CH2- as representative of organic matter, we can write an oxidation reaction as: 2 O–|soil + -CH2-|soil => 2 H2O|soil + CO|gas (5) This CO gas should have the isotopic 12C/13C signature characteristic of soil organic matter and not of any carbon source from deep below [68]. At the same tune it is likely that other trace gases besides CO would be formed by the same oxidation process, possibly formaldehyde or acetone, but no data appears to be available. In addition CO2 might be produced as the end product of the interaction of h• with soil organic matter. However, given the high background of CO2, any extra CO2 release will be near-impossible to detect. If CO is produced by a reaction of the type described by Equation (5), the animals most affected will be ground-dwelling animals [69]. They might be poisoned and killed by the increase in CO partial pressure to concentration levels on the order of 500 ppm, in particular inside their burrows. No reports of animals that died before the Gujurat earthquake appeared to have been published. However, there are anecdotal reports of mass dying of rats and mice in connection with a series of medium earthquakes in Northern Italy in May–June 2012. Reportedly the dead animals showed no sign of physical injury [70].3. Results and Discussion The International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection (ICEF) had been convened in the aftermath of the magnitude 6.3 L’Aquila earthquake of April 6, 2009. In its Final Report [71], the ICEF commented on the question of animal behavior as follows: “An ever-popular subject of investigation is anomalous animal behavior observed before earthquakes [72]. In some cases, purported precursory behaviors have been discounted by systematic studies [73]. Animals, including humans, do respond to signals that they can feel, such as small earthquakes that might be foreshocks [74]. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some animal species may have evolved “early warning” systems that allow individuals to respond in the few seconds prior to the onset of strong shaking, most probably triggered by the weak shaking of the first-arriving P wave [75]. Geobiologists have also speculated on the evolution of sensory systems that could detect more subtle precursory signals [52]. However, there is no credible scientific evidence that animals display behaviors indicative of earthquake-related environmental disturbances that are unobservable by the physical and chemical sensor systems available to earthquake scientists.” By opening this passage with the words “ever-popular subject of investigation”, used here in an obviously denigrating tone, the ICEF Final Report does not contribute in a constructive way to the discussion of issues related to animals and earthquakes. Statements like this, however, are understandable, if one takes into consideration that the majority of the ICEF members are seismologists who tend to look at pre-EQ animal responses from the mechanical perspective of mainstream seismology. This prevailing attitude makes it difficult, if not impossible, to recognize the complexity of the interactions between animals and the physical world. The real problem is not the absence of observationally well-documented facts about unusual animal behavior but a lack of understanding how the reported non-seismic pre-EQ phenomena are generated in the natural environments, and what are the non-seismic stimuli to which animals appear to respond. The discovery of positive hole charge carriers, h•, has led to insights into the physical processes that occur deep in the Earth crust during the build-up of high levels of stress and into the range of unusual properties that seem to be characteristic of these previously unrecognized electronic charge carriers in rocks [28]. The purpose of our paper is to draw attention to the fact that, during build-up of stresses—but before catastrophic rupture—an activation of h• charge carriers takes place in rocks that form the deeper layers of the Earth crust. This is a non-seismic process that takes place during every episode of waxing stress in the Earth crust regardless of whether or not the rocks will rupture catastrophically. Stress-activation of h• charge carriers, a quintessential pre-EQ phenomenon, is essential to all non-seismic pre-EQ phenomena mentioned in this paper. As highly mobile electronic charge carriers, the h• have the ability to spread out of the stressed rock volume into the surrounding less stressed or unstressed rocks. They can travel fast and far. During their propagation through the Earth crust they can generate ULF and ELF electromagnetic radiation. Upon arrival at the ground-to-air interface they can cause air ionization and corona discharges. Upon arrival at the ground-to-water interface they can act as highly oxidizing •O radicals and oxidize H2O to H2O2. Through coupling to the electron transport chain in vivo, by modulating the electron transport along the ETC, ULF and ELF waves can transfer energy, which exceeds the buffering capacity against free radicals and thereby cause oxidative stress in living organisms [76]. It was shown that, consistently, some ubiquitous environmental factors feedback directly on heredity through the ETC in organisms by leaking electrons that result in oxidative damage and genome sequence variation (i.e., non-random mutation) between generations [67]. Animals can clearly respond to a range of different physical and chemical stimuli arising directly or indirectly from the stress-activation of h• charge carriers. Indeed, understanding the nature of these enigmatic the electronic charge carriers in rocks provides insight, which was previously not unavailable, into the modulation of redox states in the Earth’s ecosystems from the global scale down to the atomic level.4. Conclusions A previously unknown or overlooked physical process takes place in rocks that are subjected to large stresses deep below in the Earth crust before major earthquakes. This process leads to the activation of electronic charge carriers, which can spread out of the stressed rock volume into the surrounding rocks, traveling fast and far. They generate electromagnetic waves, of which the ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) portion can be transmitted through rocks. The ULF and ELF waves have the capacity to interact with living organisms and to interfere with fundamental biochemical reactions at the cellular level. When the charge carriers arrive at the ground-to-air interface, they are able to ionize the air producing—under certain conditions—exclusively positive airborne ions. Such positive airborne ions are known to have pronounced and generally detrimental physiological effects. When these charge carriers arrive at the water-to-air interface, they oxidize the water and possibly organic compounds dissolved in the water, producing potentially hazardous toxins. Understanding the complex sequence of events taking place in the Earth crust during the lead-up to major earthquakes provides insight into the causes of unusual pre-earthquake animal behavior.

    "abstract": "Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease that began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020. Because at the time of writing no vaccine is yet available, a rapid diagnostic assay is very urgently needed. Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identification, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached to the gold nanoparticle via an Au–S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form “hot spots” to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles via light–matter interactions. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our reported data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to inhibit infection by the virus. Our reported data show that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors, which stops virus infection and spread. It also has the capability to destroy the lipid membrane of the virus.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), is responsible for huge global disruption to health and economies.1–10 As of 13 November 2020, more than 59.4 million people have suffered from COVID-19 disease and around 1.40 million have died worldwide1,2. It is now well documented that spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) are the important structural proteins for coronavirus particles.6–16 Several reports indicate that spike protein plays the most important role for virus entry and disease pathogenesis.3–14 Because at the time of writing there are no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, rapid diagnosis is the key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.1–20 Driven by the urgent need, we report the development of an anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticle (GNP) for rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen (COVID-19 Spike Recombinant Antigen) or the virus itself via naked eye colorimetric change and highly sensitive surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Recently, Ventura et al. reported highly sensitive COVID-19 detection by means of a colorimetric assay that employed GNPs to which three different (spike, envelope, and membrane) antibodies were attached.14 In the current manuscript, we show that anti-spike antibody attached GNPs are capable of ultrasensitive identification as well as inhibition of virus particles. As we and others have reported before, owing to good biocompatibility, size dependent optical properties and ease of modification of the surface, gold nanoparticles can be used for the development of excellent biosensing platforms.17–33 As shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI,† the color of our anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticle is pink and it changed to a bluish tinge in the presence of the COVID-19 antigen or virus owing to aggregation via antigen–antibody interaction. As a result, we observed a color change upon aggregation. Based on color observation with the naked eye, we can detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL and virus particles at a concentration of 1000 virus particles per mL. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 (BSL-3) virus, we have used a BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus (pseudo SARS-CoV-2) as a model system for our diagnosis and inhibition experiments.36,37 Owing to its extremely high sensitivity, SERS can be used for detection of very low levels of viruses, bacteria, cancer cells and different biomolecules.17–27 It is now well documented that Raman signals can be enhanced by several orders (107 to 1010) of magnitude by using plasmonic nanoparticles via the electromagnetic mechanism (EM) and chemical mechanism (CM).17–27 For rapid and highly sensitive identification, SERS has been employed using 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) as reporter molecule, attached to gold nanoparticles via Au–S bonds. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, the aggregated nanoparticles form “hot spots”. As we and other groups have reported, that “hot spot” formation is a very important factor to provide extraordinary enhancement in SERS;17–27 in the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles strong SERS signals from 4-aminothiophenol have been observed, which allow diagnosis of viral antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at 18 virus particles per mL concentration. It is now well documented that for SARS-CoV-2, the viral infection starts with the binding of viral particles to receptors on the host cells, mediated by the virus spike protein.8–17,34–41 As different studies indicate that spike protein binds specifically to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells,8–17 scientists from several groups are developing inhibitors that have the capability to block the mechanism by which the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor.34–41 Herein, using pseudo SARS-CoV-2 as the model virus, we demonstrate that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to block viral entry into cells. Pseudo SARS-CoV-2 is a BSL-1 baculovirus pseudotyped with spike (S) protein. Using HEK293T cells, which express ACE2, by means of which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we demonstrate that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells.",

    "results": "Results and discussion Naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of COVID-19 antigen using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles Antigen tests are used in clinics to diagnose different virus infections, and now the FDA has approved rapid antigen tests that can identify SARS-CoV-2.2 Here, our experimental data indicate that naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of COVID-19 antigens can be performed within 5 minutes using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. S1D in the ESI,† naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of COVID-19 antigens using antibody attached GNPs is based on the fact that in the presence of COVID-19 antigen, as a result of antigen–antibody interaction, antibody attached GNPs aggregate, as shown in Fig. S2A–C in the ESI.† As a result, as shown in Fig. 1A–C, we have observed the color of the suspension of antibody attached GNPs change from pink to blue, which is due to the surface plasmon coupling between antibody attached GNPs. The TEM images in Fig. S2A–C† and DLS data in Table 1 show that as we increased the amount of COVID-19 antigen, the size of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles increased tremendously owing to aggregation. As we and others have reported before, when the interparticle distances are ∼2.5 times lower than the diameter of the nanoparticles, the aggregation of gold nanoparticles will induce the coupling of the plasmon modes very strongly, which will induce a red shift of the absorption spectrum.28–33 The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 1D show a red shift from 520 to 600 nm for aggregated antibody attached GNPs. The reported absorption spectra also indicate the broadening of the plasmon resonance peak after aggregation of antibody attached GNPs, which could be due to longitudinal resonance. To determine the sensitivity of naked eye colorimetric assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using antibody attached GNPs, we performed an antigen concentration dependence study using from 1 pg mL−1 to 10 000 pg mL−1 COVID-19 antigen. As shown in Fig. 1B, naked eye colorimetric assay can be used for the diagnosis of a minimum concentration of 1000 pg mL−1 or 1 ng mL−1 antigen. Next, we determined the selectivity of the naked eye colorimetric assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using antibody attached GNPs. Since COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are all coronaviruses, we also performed the same experiment for SARS-CoV virus antigen and MERS-CoV antigen separately using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 1C, we did not observe any colorimetric change even when 5 ng mL−1 SARS-CoV virus antigen or MERS-CoV antigen was added to the pink solution of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. The above reported data clearly show that the antibody attached GNP-based naked eye colorimetric assay is highly selective for COVID-19 spike-antigen. Naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs As we have discussed above, since SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 (BSL-3) virus, we used a BSL-2 pseudo SARS-CoV-2 with spike (S) protein as a model system for our diagnosis experiment.36,37 As shown in Fig. S1E and 2E,† naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs is based on the fact that in the presence of pseudo SARS-CoV-2, as a result of the virus spike protein–antibody interaction, antibody attached GNPs aggregate on the surface of the virus, as shown in Fig. 2A–C. Since the size of the pseudo SARS-CoV-2 is around 120–160 nm, several antibody attached GNPs can aggregate on the surface of each virus particle. The TEM image in Fig. 2C shows that as we increased the concentration of antibody attached GNPs, owing to the virus spike protein–antibody interaction, antibody attached GNPs aggregated and covered the entire surface of the virus particles. As a result, as shown in Fig. 2E, we observed the color of the suspension of antibody attached GNPs change from pink to blue, as a result of surface plasmon coupling between antibody attached GNPs. Our reported naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs is very quick and it takes less than 5 minutes to get the results. The absorption spectra in Fig. 2D show a red shift of absorption from 520 to 640 nm for aggregated antibody attached GNPs in the presence of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. To determine the sensitivity of naked eye colorimetric assay for the identification of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs, we performed a pseudo SARS-CoV-2 concentration dependence study from 10 virus particles per mL to 5000 virus particles per mL. As shown in Fig. 2E, naked eye colorimetric assay can be used for the diagnosis of a minimum concentration of 1000 virus particles per mL of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. Our reported naked eye colorimetric assay for SARS virus detection exhibits slightly higher sensitivity than the antibody attached GNP-based influenza A virus detection as reported by Liu et al.40 Highly sensitive SERS diagnosis of COVID-19 antigen and pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs Although naked eye colorimetric assay is capable of the identification of COVID-19 antigen and pseudo SARS-CoV-2 within a 5 minute time period, the sensitivity is low. To enhance the sensitivity significantly, we employed SERS for the diagnosis of COVID-19 antigen and pseudo SARS-CoV-2. As shown in Fig. 3A, for rapid and highly sensitive identification via SERS, we used 4-aminothiophenol as reporter molecule, which is attached to gold nanoparticles via Au–S bonds. Synthesis details are reported in the ESI.† Fig. 3. (A) A schematic diagram showing the synthetic path we used for the development of antibody and 4-aminothiophenol coated gold nanoparticles.

Open in a new tab Fig. 3B shows the SERS spectra from anti-spike antibody (10 ng mL−1) only attached GNPs (1.3 nM), 4-aminothiophenol (300 nM) only attached GNPs (1.3 nM) and antibody (10 ng mL−1) as well as 4-aminothiophenol (300 nM) attached gold nanoparticles (1.3 nM). As shown in Fig. 3B, in the absence of the 4-aminothiophenol Raman reporter, we did not see any Raman signal, which clearly shows that the observed Raman spectrum is mainly due to the presence of the 4-aminothiophenol Raman reporter. The Raman spectrum in Fig. 3B from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles shows Raman peaks due to the a1 vibrational modes: ν(C–C + NH2 bend) at ∼1590 cm−1 and ν[ν(C–C) + δ(C–H)] at ∼1078 cm−1.17–27 Similarly, we also observed b2 mode Raman peaks from the anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 3B: CC stretch in Ph ring + NH2 rock at ∼1435 cm−1 and ν(C–N) + ν(C–S) + γ(CCC) vibrational modes at 464 cm−1.17–27 Our SERS-based diagnosis of COVID-19 antigens using antibody attached GNPs is based on the fact that in the presence of COVID-19 antigen, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, antibody attached GNPs aggregate and form several “hot spots”, as shown in Fig. S2A–C in the ESI.† It is now well documented that “hot spot” formation is a very important factor to provide extraordinary enhancement in SERS, owing to the strong light–matter interaction via plasmon-excitation coupling.17–27 As shown in Fig. 3C, very strong SERS signals from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles are observed in the presence of COVID-19 Spike Recombinant Antigen; this is due to the formation of huge amounts of electromagnetic “hotspots”, which enhances Raman intensity by several orders of magnitude via light–matter and matter–matter interactions.17–27 To understand better how “hot spot” formation greatly enhances the SERS signal, we performed finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation.22–24,42,43 Theoretical details have been reported before by our group and other groups.22–24,26,27,42,43 For the simulation, we used 20 nm spherical gold nanoparticles, 670 nm wavelength, 0.001 nm mesh resolution, and 4000 fs time.22–24,26,27Fig. 3H shows how the square of field enhancement (|E|2) varies with distance for nanoparticles. The FDTD simulation data in Fig. 3H indicate a more than 2 orders of magnitude higher field enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles formed aggregates. As we and others have reported before, Raman enhancement is proportional to |E|4,22–24,26,27,42,43 and as a result, reported FDTD simulation data indicate that there is a possibility of 4 orders of magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Having observed a huge Raman signal enhancement in the presence of COVID-19 antigen, to determine the sensitivity of SERS assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles, we performed an antigen concentration dependence study using 1 pg mL−1 to 2000 pg mL−1 COVID-19 antigen. As shown in Fig. 3C, SERS assay can be used for the diagnosis of a minimum concentration of 1 pg mL−1 antigen, where we observed a more than 2-fold increment of the Raman signal. Fig. 3D shows how the Raman signal at 1078 cm−1 from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles varies with the concentration of COVID-19 antigen. To determine the limit of detection (LOD), we used the following equation:22–24 LOD = 3σ/S 1 where σ is the standard deviation of the blank and S is the slope of the calibration curve. For the determination of the standard deviation of the blank, we used the baseline noise. Using the concentration–dependence plot shown in Fig. 3D, we estimated the LOD to be ∼4 pg mL−1 for SERS assay using COVID-19 antigen. Next, we determined the selectivity of the SERS assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. For this purpose, we also performed the same SERS experiment for SARS-CoV virus antigen and MERS-CoV antigen separately using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 3E, we did not observe any SERS intensity change even when 1 ng mL−1 SARS-CoV antigen or MERS-CoV antigen was added to anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. The above reported data clearly show that antibody attached GNP-based SERS is highly selective for COVID-19 spike antigen. Our SERS-based diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles is based on the fact that in the presence of pseudo SARS-CoV-2, owing to the virus spike protein–antibody interaction, anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles aggregate on the surface of the virus, as shown in Fig. 2B and C. Since the size of the pseudo SARS-CoV-2 is around 120–150 nm, several anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles can aggregate on the surface of each virus particle and form several “hot spots”. As a result, as shown in Fig. 3F, we observed a huge SERS intensity change, which is due to the surface plasmon coupling between anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. Our reported SERS diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles is very quick: it takes less than 5 minutes to get the results. To determine the sensitivity of SERS assay for the identification of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles, we performed a virus concentration dependence study using from 10 to 1500 pseudo SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. As shown in Fig. 3F, SERS assay can be used for the diagnosis of the minimum concentration of 10 virus particles per mL, where we observed a more than 2-fold increment of the Raman signal. Fig. 3G shows how the Raman signal at 1078 cm−1 from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles varies with the concentration of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. Using eqn (1) and the concentration-dependent linear plot shown in Fig. 3G, we estimated the LOD to be ∼18 virus particles per mL for SERS assay using pseudo SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of our reported SERS detection assay is comparable with the Abbott Real Time SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay (40 copies per mL).44 Inhibition of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles It is now well documented that SARS-CoV-2 fusion with host cell membranes proceeds through interactions between spike proteins of the virus and the ACE2 receptor on the surface of human cells.5–16,34–41 To find out whether anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to block entry of the virus into cells, we used pseudo SARS-CoV-2 (# C1110G, Montana Molecular, Bozeman, MT) as the model virus.36–38 For our inhibition experiment we used HEK293T cells, which express ACE2, by which SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells is determined.36–38 As shown in Fig. 4A–C, anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells. Our data show that the inhibition efficiency was 100% for 100 ng mL−1 anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles and 60% for 10 ng mL−1 anti-spike antibody attached GNPs. In contrast, our experimental data indicate that the inhibition efficiencies for PEG coated GNPs and 100 ng mL−1 antibody only were very low, less than 1%. Thus, for the design of anti-spike antibody GNPs we used 100 ng mL−1 antibody, since our data indicated 100% inhibition efficiency in the presence of 100 ng mL−1 anti-spike-antibody attached gold nanoparticles.

(D) A TEM image showing that 100 ng mL−1 anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles can break the lipid membrane of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. Open in a new tabThe inhibition is possibly due to antibody attached gold nanoparticles binding to pseudo SARS-CoV-2, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to the cell receptor,14,34–41 and as a result, preventing the virus from infecting the targeted cells.34–41 But also, as shown in Fig. 4D, antibody attached GNPs have the capability to break the lipid membrane of pseudo SARS-CoV-2, so that the virus particle collapses.34–41 And, as we and others have reported before, gold nanoparticles suppress viral infection by selectively cleaving disulfide bonds, which blocks membrane fusion and viral entry to the host cell.14,34,35,38–41 We believe that all the above discussed mechanisms are responsible for the 100% inhibition efficiency observed using the anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions We have developed novel anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for rapid virus diagnosis and inhibition. Our reported data demonstrate that antibody attached GNPs can be used for the naked eye detection of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 via a simple colorimetric change. Our experimental data show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticle-based sensing of COVID-19 viral antigen or virus is very fast: they can be detected within a 5 minute time period. Our results show that a naked eye assay allows the presence of antigen or virus to be determined even at a concentration of 1 ng mL−1 for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for pseudo SARS-CoV-2. We have also demonstrated that, using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS, COVID-19 viral antigen or virus at very low concentrations can be diagnosed within 5 minutes. Our reported data show that, using a portable Raman analyzer, our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen, even at a concentration of 4 pg mL−1 and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL. Our reported finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement occurs in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles formed aggregates. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by means of which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into human cells, we demonstrated that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to control viral infection. Our reported data show that the inhibition efficiency is 100% for anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. On the other hand, for GNPs alone the inhibition efficiency is only around 1% and for 100 ng mL−1 antibody the inhibition efficiency is less than 1%. That our reported data indicate 100% inhibition efficiency in the presence of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles may be due to the fact that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to pseudo SARS-CoV-2, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors. Our data show that antibody attached GNPs block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells. They also destroy the virus lipid membrane.",

This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry  Copyright notice ID: 8323809 PMID: 34381960 Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease that began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020. Because at the time of writing no vaccine is yet available, a rapid diagnostic assay is very urgently needed. Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identification, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached to the gold nanoparticle via an Au–S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form “hot spots” to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles via light–matter interactions. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our reported data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to inhibit infection by the virus. Our reported data show that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors, which stops virus infection and spread. It also has the capability to destroy the lipid membrane of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease that began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020.Introduction The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), is responsible for huge global disruption to health and economies.1–10 As of 13 November 2020, more than 59.4 million people have suffered from COVID-19 disease and around 1.40 million have died worldwide1,2. It is now well documented that spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) are the important structural proteins for coronavirus particles.6–16 Several reports indicate that spike protein plays the most important role for virus entry and disease pathogenesis.3–14 Because at the time of writing there are no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, rapid diagnosis is the key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.1–20 Driven by the urgent need, we report the development of an anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticle (GNP) for rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen (COVID-19 Spike Recombinant Antigen) or the virus itself via naked eye colorimetric change and highly sensitive surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Recently, Ventura et al. reported highly sensitive COVID-19 detection by means of a colorimetric assay that employed GNPs to which three different (spike, envelope, and membrane) antibodies were attached.14 In the current manuscript, we show that anti-spike antibody attached GNPs are capable of ultrasensitive identification as well as inhibition of virus particles. As we and others have reported before, owing to good biocompatibility, size dependent optical properties and ease of modification of the surface, gold nanoparticles can be used for the development of excellent biosensing platforms.17–33 As shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI,† the color of our anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticle is pink and it changed to a bluish tinge in the presence of the COVID-19 antigen or virus owing to aggregation via antigen–antibody interaction. As a result, we observed a color change upon aggregation. Based on color observation with the naked eye, we can detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL and virus particles at a concentration of 1000 virus particles per mL. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 (BSL-3) virus, we have used a BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus (pseudo SARS-CoV-2) as a model system for our diagnosis and inhibition experiments.36,37 Owing to its extremely high sensitivity, SERS can be used for detection of very low levels of viruses, bacteria, cancer cells and different biomolecules.17–27 It is now well documented that Raman signals can be enhanced by several orders (107 to 1010) of magnitude by using plasmonic nanoparticles via the electromagnetic mechanism (EM) and chemical mechanism (CM).17–27 For rapid and highly sensitive identification, SERS has been employed using 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) as reporter molecule, attached to gold nanoparticles via Au–S bonds. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, the aggregated nanoparticles form “hot spots”. As we and other groups have reported, that “hot spot” formation is a very important factor to provide extraordinary enhancement in SERS;17–27 in the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles strong SERS signals from 4-aminothiophenol have been observed, which allow diagnosis of viral antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at 18 virus particles per mL concentration. It is now well documented that for SARS-CoV-2, the viral infection starts with the binding of viral particles to receptors on the host cells, mediated by the virus spike protein.8–17,34–41 As different studies indicate that spike protein binds specifically to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells,8–17 scientists from several groups are developing inhibitors that have the capability to block the mechanism by which the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor.34–41 Herein, using pseudo SARS-CoV-2 as the model virus, we demonstrate that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to block viral entry into cells. Pseudo SARS-CoV-2 is a BSL-1 baculovirus pseudotyped with spike (S) protein. Using HEK293T cells, which express ACE2, by means of which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we demonstrate that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells.Experimental section Citrate coated gold nanoparticle synthesis As shown in Fig. S1A in the ESI,† citrate coated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) were synthesized using HAuCl4·3H2O and sodium citrate, as we and others have reported before.17–30 For this purpose, we used a 0.01% solution of HAuCl4·3H2O and 1 wt% of sodium citrate. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and colorimetric and dynamic light scattering (DLS) data were used to characterize the freshly synthesized nanoparticles. Table 1 shows the DLS data, indicating that the size of the freshly prepared citrate coated GNPs is ∼15 ± 2 nm. The inset picture in Fig. S1A† shows the color of freshly prepared GNPs is pink. As we and others have reported before, GNPs exhibit unique optical properties due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR).17–30 It is well documented that the SPR band for citrate coated gold nanoparticles is due to phase changes resulting from the increased rate of electron-surface collisions compared with larger particles.28–33Fig. 1A shows the absorption spectra of citrate coated gold nanoparticles, in which λmax is seen to be ∼520 nm. As we and others have reported before,20–33 SPR of gold nanoparticles yields exceptionally high absorption, with extinction coefficient ε(15)520nm = 3.6 × 108 cm−1 M−1, which we used here for sensing of COVID-19 antigen or virus using naked eye colorimetric study. Size of GNPs under different coating conditions, measured via dynamic light scattering. This table also reports how the size of anti-spike antibody attached GNPs varies in the presence of different amounts of COVID-19 antigen via aggregation.

No color change was observed in the presence of 5 ng mL−1 MERS-CoV nucleoprotein antigen and 5 ng mL−1 SERS-CoV nucleoprotein antigen. (D) Absorption spectra from antibody attached GNPs in the presence of different concentrations of COVID-19 antigen. Open in a new tabThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum from citrate coated gold nanoparticles shown in Fig. S2D† shows (111), (200), (220) and (311) diffraction peaks, due to face centered cubic gold (JCPDS 04-0784).20–30 The particle concentration was measured by UV-visible spectroscopy using the molar extinction coefficient at the wavelength of the maximum absorption of the gold colloid (ε(15)519nm = 3.6 × 108 cm−1 M−1), as we and others have reported before.28–30PEG coated gold nanoparticle synthesis In the next step, as shown in Fig. S1B in the ESI,† to render the GNPs biocompatible, they were coated with HS-PEG-COOH. For this purpose, we used carboxy-PEG12-thiol (HS-PEG12-COOH). We dissolved 10 mg of HS-PEG12-COOH in 5 mL of water and then added citrate coated GNPs using a syringe and vigorous stirring. After sonication of the mixture for 30 minutes, the final products were separated through centrifugation. As reported in Table 1, after PEG coating, the size of the GNPs had increased to ∼18 ± 4 nm. The inset picture in Fig. S1B† shows that the color of freshly prepared PEG coated GNPs is pink. Fig. 1A shows the absorption spectrum of PEG coated gold nanoparticles, in which λmax is ∼521 nm, which indicates that after coating with PEG, the optical spectrum for GNPs remains almost the same.Anti-spike antibody coated gold nanoparticle synthesis For targeted diagnosis and inhibition, we developed anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. For this purpose, we used EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide)/NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) chemistry. In short, we added 0.2 molar (M) EDC and 0.05 M N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt [1 : 3 (v/v) ratio] to a solution containing GNPs and anti-spike antibody, and the mixture was sonicated for 30 minutes. After that, anti-spike antibody attached GNPs were separated from GNPs without antibody via centrifugation for 15 minutes at 6000 rpm, followed by resuspension in buffer. As reported in Table 1, after antibody attachment the size of GNPs had increased to ∼27 ± 6 nm. To determine how many antibodies were attached to the GNPs, we synthesized Cy3 dye attached anti-spike antibody conjugated GNPs. After separation of the Cy3 dye attached antibody conjugated GNPs from unconjugated molecules, we added 10 μM potassium cyanide to oxidize the GNPs. After that, from fluorescence data we estimated that about 10 ng mL−1 antibodies were attached on GNPs. The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum from anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles shown in Fig. S2E† contains amide-A, amide-I, amide-II and amide-II bands, which indicates that anti-spike-antibodies are attached on the surface of the gold nanoparticles. The inset picture in Fig. S1C† shows the color of freshly prepared antibody GNPs is pink. Fig. 2D shows the absorption spectra of antibody attached gold nanoparticles, in which λmax is ∼522 nm, which indicate that after attaching antibody, the optical spectrum for GNPs remains almost the same.

Open in a new tabThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra from antibody attached gold nanoparticles as reported in Fig. S2D† show (111), (200), (220) and (311) diffraction peaks, which indicate that the crystal structure remains the same after conjugation with antibody.Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles For the detection of COVID-19 antigen and virus using SERS, we used our developed portable Raman spectrometer with laser excitation of 670 nm.22–24,26,27 In our design we have used an InPhotonics 670 nm Raman fiber optic probe for excitation and data collection. For SERS signal collection, we used a miniaturized QE65000 Scientific-grade Spectrometer from Ocean Optics.22–24,26,27 All SERS spectra were taken on drop-cast dried glass slides. For Raman data collection we used 10 second acquisition time and 5-scan averaging, so that we could achieve very good signal-to-noise ratio.22–24,26,27SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype particles Pseudo SARS-CoV-2 (Cat. # C1110G) was purchased from Montana Molecular, Bozeman, MT 59715, USA. HEK293T cells (ATCC # CRL3216) plated in twelve-well tissue culture dishes were infected with the pseudotyped virus with a dilution range of 102 to 107, and virus titers were calculated by counting green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive cells under a fluorescence microscope.36–38Virus inhibition assays HEK293T cells (ATCC # CRL3216) were plated on a 96-well plate in complete medium (DMEM + 10% FBS) and incubated under normal growth conditions (5% CO2 and 37 °C, protected from light) for 12–24 hours.36–38 These HEK293T cells express low levels of ACE2 receptor which are sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Dilutions of test nanoparticles were made in DMEM with a final volume of 100 μL each.36–38 The pseudovirus stock (2.5 μL of the 2 × 1010 units permL stock) was mixed with the diluted nanoparticles and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, then laid over HEK293T cells plated in the 96-well tissue culture dishes, along with 0.6 μL of 500 nM sodium butyrate (to give a final concentration of 2 mM). Plates were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 48 h. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and the assay was read on a Cytation 5 automated fluorescence microscope (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA).36–38Results and discussion Naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of COVID-19 antigen using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles Antigen tests are used in clinics to diagnose different virus infections, and now the FDA has approved rapid antigen tests that can identify SARS-CoV-2.2 Here, our experimental data indicate that naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of COVID-19 antigens can be performed within 5 minutes using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. S1D in the ESI,† naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of COVID-19 antigens using antibody attached GNPs is based on the fact that in the presence of COVID-19 antigen, as a result of antigen–antibody interaction, antibody attached GNPs aggregate, as shown in Fig. S2A–C in the ESI.† As a result, as shown in Fig. 1A–C, we have observed the color of the suspension of antibody attached GNPs change from pink to blue, which is due to the surface plasmon coupling between antibody attached GNPs. The TEM images in Fig. S2A–C† and DLS data in Table 1 show that as we increased the amount of COVID-19 antigen, the size of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles increased tremendously owing to aggregation. As we and others have reported before, when the interparticle distances are ∼2.5 times lower than the diameter of the nanoparticles, the aggregation of gold nanoparticles will induce the coupling of the plasmon modes very strongly, which will induce a red shift of the absorption spectrum.28–33 The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 1D show a red shift from 520 to 600 nm for aggregated antibody attached GNPs. The reported absorption spectra also indicate the broadening of the plasmon resonance peak after aggregation of antibody attached GNPs, which could be due to longitudinal resonance. To determine the sensitivity of naked eye colorimetric assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using antibody attached GNPs, we performed an antigen concentration dependence study using from 1 pg mL−1 to 10 000 pg mL−1 COVID-19 antigen. As shown in Fig. 1B, naked eye colorimetric assay can be used for the diagnosis of a minimum concentration of 1000 pg mL−1 or 1 ng mL−1 antigen. Next, we determined the selectivity of the naked eye colorimetric assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using antibody attached GNPs. Since COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are all coronaviruses, we also performed the same experiment for SARS-CoV virus antigen and MERS-CoV antigen separately using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 1C, we did not observe any colorimetric change even when 5 ng mL−1 SARS-CoV virus antigen or MERS-CoV antigen was added to the pink solution of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. The above reported data clearly show that the antibody attached GNP-based naked eye colorimetric assay is highly selective for COVID-19 spike-antigen.Naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs As we have discussed above, since SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 (BSL-3) virus, we used a BSL-2 pseudo SARS-CoV-2 with spike (S) protein as a model system for our diagnosis experiment.36,37 As shown in Fig. S1E and 2E,† naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs is based on the fact that in the presence of pseudo SARS-CoV-2, as a result of the virus spike protein–antibody interaction, antibody attached GNPs aggregate on the surface of the virus, as shown in Fig. 2A–C. Since the size of the pseudo SARS-CoV-2 is around 120–160 nm, several antibody attached GNPs can aggregate on the surface of each virus particle. The TEM image in Fig. 2C shows that as we increased the concentration of antibody attached GNPs, owing to the virus spike protein–antibody interaction, antibody attached GNPs aggregated and covered the entire surface of the virus particles. As a result, as shown in Fig. 2E, we observed the color of the suspension of antibody attached GNPs change from pink to blue, as a result of surface plasmon coupling between antibody attached GNPs. Our reported naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs is very quick and it takes less than 5 minutes to get the results. The absorption spectra in Fig. 2D show a red shift of absorption from 520 to 640 nm for aggregated antibody attached GNPs in the presence of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. To determine the sensitivity of naked eye colorimetric assay for the identification of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs, we performed a pseudo SARS-CoV-2 concentration dependence study from 10 virus particles per mL to 5000 virus particles per mL. As shown in Fig. 2E, naked eye colorimetric assay can be used for the diagnosis of a minimum concentration of 1000 virus particles per mL of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. Our reported naked eye colorimetric assay for SARS virus detection exhibits slightly higher sensitivity than the antibody attached GNP-based influenza A virus detection as reported by Liu et al.40Highly sensitive SERS diagnosis of COVID-19 antigen and pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs Although naked eye colorimetric assay is capable of the identification of COVID-19 antigen and pseudo SARS-CoV-2 within a 5 minute time period, the sensitivity is low. To enhance the sensitivity significantly, we employed SERS for the diagnosis of COVID-19 antigen and pseudo SARS-CoV-2. As shown in Fig. 3A, for rapid and highly sensitive identification via SERS, we used 4-aminothiophenol as reporter molecule, which is attached to gold nanoparticles via Au–S bonds. Synthesis details are reported in the ESI.† Fig. 3. (A) A schematic diagram showing the synthetic path we used for the development of antibody and 4-aminothiophenol coated gold nanoparticles.

(H) FDTD simulation data showing how the (|E|2) profile varies with an increase in the number of gold nanoparticles in aggregates. Open in a new tab Fig. 3B shows the SERS spectra from anti-spike antibody (10 ng mL−1) only attached GNPs (1.3 nM), 4-aminothiophenol (300 nM) only attached GNPs (1.3 nM) and antibody (10 ng mL−1) as well as 4-aminothiophenol (300 nM) attached gold nanoparticles (1.3 nM). As shown in Fig. 3B, in the absence of the 4-aminothiophenol Raman reporter, we did not see any Raman signal, which clearly shows that the observed Raman spectrum is mainly due to the presence of the 4-aminothiophenol Raman reporter. The Raman spectrum in Fig. 3B from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles shows Raman peaks due to the a1 vibrational modes: ν(C–C + NH2 bend) at ∼1590 cm−1 and ν[ν(C–C) + δ(C–H)] at ∼1078 cm−1.17–27 Similarly, we also observed b2 mode Raman peaks from the anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 3B: CC stretch in Ph ring + NH2 rock at ∼1435 cm−1 and ν(C–N) + ν(C–S) + γ(CCC) vibrational modes at 464 cm−1.17–27 Our SERS-based diagnosis of COVID-19 antigens using antibody attached GNPs is based on the fact that in the presence of COVID-19 antigen, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, antibody attached GNPs aggregate and form several “hot spots”, as shown in Fig. S2A–C in the ESI.† It is now well documented that “hot spot” formation is a very important factor to provide extraordinary enhancement in SERS, owing to the strong light–matter interaction via plasmon-excitation coupling.17–27 As shown in Fig. 3C, very strong SERS signals from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles are observed in the presence of COVID-19 Spike Recombinant Antigen; this is due to the formation of huge amounts of electromagnetic “hotspots”, which enhances Raman intensity by several orders of magnitude via light–matter and matter–matter interactions.17–27 To understand better how “hot spot” formation greatly enhances the SERS signal, we performed finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation.22–24,42,43 Theoretical details have been reported before by our group and other groups.22–24,26,27,42,43 For the simulation, we used 20 nm spherical gold nanoparticles, 670 nm wavelength, 0.001 nm mesh resolution, and 4000 fs time.22–24,26,27Fig. 3H shows how the square of field enhancement (|E|2) varies with distance for nanoparticles. The FDTD simulation data in Fig. 3H indicate a more than 2 orders of magnitude higher field enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles formed aggregates. As we and others have reported before, Raman enhancement is proportional to |E|4,22–24,26,27,42,43 and as a result, reported FDTD simulation data indicate that there is a possibility of 4 orders of magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Having observed a huge Raman signal enhancement in the presence of COVID-19 antigen, to determine the sensitivity of SERS assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles, we performed an antigen concentration dependence study using 1 pg mL−1 to 2000 pg mL−1 COVID-19 antigen. As shown in Fig. 3C, SERS assay can be used for the diagnosis of a minimum concentration of 1 pg mL−1 antigen, where we observed a more than 2-fold increment of the Raman signal. Fig. 3D shows how the Raman signal at 1078 cm−1 from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles varies with the concentration of COVID-19 antigen. To determine the limit of detection (LOD), we used the following equation:22–24 LOD = 3σ/S 1 where σ is the standard deviation of the blank and S is the slope of the calibration curve. For the determination of the standard deviation of the blank, we used the baseline noise. Using the concentration–dependence plot shown in Fig. 3D, we estimated the LOD to be ∼4 pg mL−1 for SERS assay using COVID-19 antigen. Next, we determined the selectivity of the SERS assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. For this purpose, we also performed the same SERS experiment for SARS-CoV virus antigen and MERS-CoV antigen separately using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 3E, we did not observe any SERS intensity change even when 1 ng mL−1 SARS-CoV antigen or MERS-CoV antigen was added to anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. The above reported data clearly show that antibody attached GNP-based SERS is highly selective for COVID-19 spike antigen. Our SERS-based diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles is based on the fact that in the presence of pseudo SARS-CoV-2, owing to the virus spike protein–antibody interaction, anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles aggregate on the surface of the virus, as shown in Fig. 2B and C. Since the size of the pseudo SARS-CoV-2 is around 120–150 nm, several anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles can aggregate on the surface of each virus particle and form several “hot spots”. As a result, as shown in Fig. 3F, we observed a huge SERS intensity change, which is due to the surface plasmon coupling between anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. Our reported SERS diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles is very quick: it takes less than 5 minutes to get the results. To determine the sensitivity of SERS assay for the identification of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles, we performed a virus concentration dependence study using from 10 to 1500 pseudo SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. As shown in Fig. 3F, SERS assay can be used for the diagnosis of the minimum concentration of 10 virus particles per mL, where we observed a more than 2-fold increment of the Raman signal. Fig. 3G shows how the Raman signal at 1078 cm−1 from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles varies with the concentration of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. Using eqn (1) and the concentration-dependent linear plot shown in Fig. 3G, we estimated the LOD to be ∼18 virus particles per mL for SERS assay using pseudo SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of our reported SERS detection assay is comparable with the Abbott Real Time SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay (40 copies per mL).44Inhibition of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles It is now well documented that SARS-CoV-2 fusion with host cell membranes proceeds through interactions between spike proteins of the virus and the ACE2 receptor on the surface of human cells.5–16,34–41 To find out whether anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to block entry of the virus into cells, we used pseudo SARS-CoV-2 (# C1110G, Montana Molecular, Bozeman, MT) as the model virus.36–38 For our inhibition experiment we used HEK293T cells, which express ACE2, by which SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells is determined.36–38 As shown in Fig. 4A–C, anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells. Our data show that the inhibition efficiency was 100% for 100 ng mL−1 anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles and 60% for 10 ng mL−1 anti-spike antibody attached GNPs. In contrast, our experimental data indicate that the inhibition efficiencies for PEG coated GNPs and 100 ng mL−1 antibody only were very low, less than 1%. Thus, for the design of anti-spike antibody GNPs we used 100 ng mL−1 antibody, since our data indicated 100% inhibition efficiency in the presence of 100 ng mL−1 anti-spike-antibody attached gold nanoparticles. Fig. 4. (A) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in infected HEK293T cells in the absence of antibody attached gold nanoparticles. (B) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus GFP expression in infected HEK293T cells in the presence of 10 ng mL−1 anti-spike antibody. (C) Variations in the inhibition efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in infected HEK293T cells in the presence of buffer (Mock), gold nanoparticles (GNPs), anti-spike antibody, and anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. (D) A TEM image showing that 100 ng mL−1 anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles can break the lipid membrane of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. Open in a new tabThe inhibition is possibly due to antibody attached gold nanoparticles binding to pseudo SARS-CoV-2, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to the cell receptor,14,34–41 and as a result, preventing the virus from infecting the targeted cells.34–41 But also, as shown in Fig. 4D, antibody attached GNPs have the capability to break the lipid membrane of pseudo SARS-CoV-2, so that the virus particle collapses.34–41 And, as we and others have reported before, gold nanoparticles suppress viral infection by selectively cleaving disulfide bonds, which blocks membrane fusion and viral entry to the host cell.14,34,35,38–41 We believe that all the above discussed mechanisms are responsible for the 100% inhibition efficiency observed using the anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles.Conclusions We have developed novel anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for rapid virus diagnosis and inhibition. Our reported data demonstrate that antibody attached GNPs can be used for the naked eye detection of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 via a simple colorimetric change. Our experimental data show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticle-based sensing of COVID-19 viral antigen or virus is very fast: they can be detected within a 5 minute time period. Our results show that a naked eye assay allows the presence of antigen or virus to be determined even at a concentration of 1 ng mL−1 for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for pseudo SARS-CoV-2. We have also demonstrated that, using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS, COVID-19 viral antigen or virus at very low concentrations can be diagnosed within 5 minutes. Our reported data show that, using a portable Raman analyzer, our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen, even at a concentration of 4 pg mL−1 and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL. Our reported finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement occurs in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles formed aggregates. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by means of which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into human cells, we demonstrated that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to control viral infection. Our reported data show that the inhibition efficiency is 100% for anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. On the other hand, for GNPs alone the inhibition efficiency is only around 1% and for 100 ng mL−1 antibody the inhibition efficiency is less than 1%. That our reported data indicate 100% inhibition efficiency in the presence of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles may be due to the fact that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to pseudo SARS-CoV-2, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors. Our data show that antibody attached GNPs block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells. They also destroy the virus lipid membrane.Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest to declare.Supplementary Material NA-003-D0NA01007C-s001 NA-003-D0NA01007C-s001.pdf (507.4KB, pdf) Acknowledgments Dr Ray thanks the National Science Foundation for generous funding via NSF-RAPID grant # DMR-2030439 and NSF-PREM grant # DMR-1826886.

    "abstract": "Abstract The emergence of double mutation delta (B.1.617.2) variants has dropped vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil α-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding with host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant spike protein, the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly. Experimental quenching data shows a nonlinear Stern–Volmer quenching profile, which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the modified Hill equation, we have determined n = 2.6 and the effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, experimental data shows that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells via blocking the ACE2–spike protein binding. Experimental data shows that the inhibition efficiency for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than that of only one type of peptide-attached GQDs.",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction The current global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for over 5.4 million death till now.1−4 It is now well understood that during COVID-19 infection, the spike protein S1 unit containing the receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) facilitates the virus attachment to humans by binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the nasal epithelial mucosal cells, which is the key path for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells.5−9 Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein became the target for COVID-19 vaccines available in the market, which can generate neutralizing antibodies against the S-RBD upon immunization.9−14 The emergence of double mutant delta (B.1.617.2) variants, which contain the L452R and T478K mutations on the S-RBD, has enhanced the binding affinity with ACE2.1−6 Recent reports also indicate that mutations on the S-RBD lead to a prominent decline in neutralizing antibody levels against the delta variant by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination.7−12 Due to the above fact, designing a new strategy to block the spike protein–ACE interaction is very important for preventing mutate variant infection. Although the mortality rate is very high for COVID-19, reported data also indicates that around 42% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively controlled by the human’s innate immune system.1−9 α-Defensin human neutrophil peptides (HNP1, HNP2, HNP3, and HNP4) and human β-defensins (HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3) as well as LL-37 (leucine-leucine-37) cathelicidin family peptides are members of the innate immune system.11,15−17 Defensins and cathelicidin peptides play a crucial role in the human body for viral inhibition via binding and destabilizing.11,15−17 Driven by the need to block the delta variant infection, herein we report the design of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which have the capability to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD and block the S-RBD interaction with ACE2, which prevents the virus entry into the host cells, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab (A) Scheme showing the design of HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-conjugated GQDs and binding of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD. (B) Scheme showing the blocking of the S-RBD interaction with ACE2 on a human cell membrane and preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus entry. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) consisting of a graphene lattice and containing single or few sheets of graphene fragments exhibit size-dependent luminescence properties originating from the quantum confinement effects and edge effects.18−23 GQDs containing different surface groups such as carboxy, epoxy, and hydroxyl exhibit a high water solubility, high surface area, excellent photostability, and biocompatibility.18−23 Due to their unique optical and other properties, GQDs became a very good choice for use in bioimaging, biosensing, and other biotechnology applications.18−23 In our design, bioconjugated GQD fluorescence has been used to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD–host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction to determine the effective binding affinity. Also, the functional groups on the surface and edge of GQDs have been used for the inactivation of the virus via decomposition of the lipid membrane of the virus and for the removal of spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Synthesis and Characterization of HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs) GQDs were developed in a two-step process, as shown in Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information. Initially, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were synthesized from natural graphite powder using the modified Hummer’s method as we and others have reported before.18−23 In the next step, GQDs were synthesized using a hydrothermal method in the presence of dimethyl formamide (DMF).18−23 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image reported in Figure S2A in the Supporting Information shows the two-dimensional (2D) morphology of the freshly prepared GO with 5 ± 2 μm size. On the other hand, the TEM image reported in Figure S2B shows the zero-dimensional (0D) morphology of the freshly prepared GQDs whose sizes are 4 ± 2 nm. Table S1 shows the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement data, which matches well with the TEM data. As shown in Figure 1A, for the development of HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, we used carbodiimide coupling chemistry between the carboxy group of graphene oxides and the amine group of peptides. The FTIR data from peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in Figure S2G, shows the presence of the −OH stretch, −CH stretch, −amide-I, −amide-II, and −amide-III bands, which indicates that the peptides are attached on the GQD surfaces. The DLS data indicates the ζ-potential changes from −14 ± 2 mV to 3 ± 1 mV after peptide binding, which also indicates that the peptides are on the surface of GQDs. The TEM data reported in Figure 2A indicates that the size of peptide-conjugated GQDs are 6 ± 2 nm, which matches very well with the DLS data reported in Table S1. The inset in Figure 2A shows the high-resolution TEM for peptide-conjugated GQDs, which shows the graphite structure with a stripe distance of ∼0.24 nm.18−23 Similarly, Figure S2C in the Supporting Information shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, which indicates a broad peak at 26.5° due to the (002) reflection of graphite.18−23Figure S2D shows the Raman spectra of peptide-attached GQDs, which indicate the presence of the D band at ∼1350 cm–1 and the G band at ∼1590 cm–1 due to the graphene structure.18−23 Figure 2.

Binding Studies between the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs Using Peptide-Attached GQD-Based Luminescence For the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD and HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, we used a binding buffer. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. For the detection of luminescence from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, in the presence and absence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD, we used a portable fluorescence spectrometer developed by us with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser.13,14,21,22 For emission signal collection, we used a miniaturized QE65000 spectrometer from Ocean Optics.13,14,21,22 All measurements were performed with 5 ms integration time with five spectra averaging using the software.13,14,21,22 2.3. ELISA-like Assay for Determining the Binding between the Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein and Peptide-Attached GQDs For this purpose, we used an ELISA-like assay using His-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins, which were adsorbed to a 96-well plate overnight at 4 °C. For comparison with fluorescence assay data, we kept the concentrations of GQDs and spike proteins the same for both the measurements. After that, the plate was blocked using a blocking buffer and then different concentrations of peptide-attached GQDs were incubated on the plate. In the next step, we used a streptavidin protein that is covalently conjugated to a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme to determine the binding.11−15 We also used TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) for colorimetric assay detection.11−15 Signal intensity was recorded using a plate reader. After that, data were graphed in GraphPad Prism. From the binding curve, we estimated the binding constants (KD) using the Hill equation, as reported before.7,8,11,12 2.4. In Vitro Experiments for Blocking ACE2 Binding with Baculovirus Pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein Using Fluorescence Imaging For this experiment, we used human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T).11−15,26,27 Since delta variant SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, for our experiment, we used a GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number #C1123G).11−15,26,27 The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. 2.5. Virus Inhibition Experiments for HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs For this experiment, we used HEK293T cells. Dilutions of test HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs were made in DMEM.13,14,26,27 The GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein stock was mixed with the HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs at different concentrations and incubated for 1 h. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.",
    "results": "3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Determining the Photoluminescence Quantum Yield and Lifetime from HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs The UV–vis spectra from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in Figure S2E, show two peaks. The first absorption peak is observed at ∼270 nm, which can be due to the π–π* transition, and the second peak is at ∼306 nm, which can be due to the n−π* transition.18−23Figure S2F and Figure 2C show the luminescence spectra of peptide-attached GQDs at 360 nm excitation, where the strong emission maximum at 416 nm can be due to the electron–hole recombination and quantum size effect.18−23Figure 2B shows that peptide-attached GQDs exhibit a strong blue fluorescence under UV light. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was determined to be ∼0.28 for peptide-attached GQDs. The photoluminescence decay profiles for peptide-attached GQDs are reported in Figure 2D, which fit very well with the triple exponential function with τ1 = 0.32 ns, τ2 = 2.2 ns, and τ3 = 7.3 ns. 3.2. Determining the Biocompatibility and Cytotoxicity To determine the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, we used normal skin HaCaT cells, lung cancer A549 cells, and human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T).11−15,26,27 All cells were treated with 60 μg/mL GQDs + 4 μg/mL LL-37 + 4 μg/mL HNP1 for 48 h.11−15,26,27 As reported in Figures S3A,B in the Supporting Information, after treatment with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs or only GQDs or only peptides, the cell viability was hardly changed for all the cell lines. The reported experimental data clearly indicate that the LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs do not exhibit any detectable cytotoxicity after 48 h of treatment. 3.3. Determining the Binding Affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs Next, we have determined whether the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD can bind with HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, which is a very important parameter for the inhibition of virus infection. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. The luminescence signals from GQDs in the presence and absence of the spike protein were recorded with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser.11−15,26,27 The reported photograph in Figure 2B also shows that the intense fluorescence from peptide-conjugated GQDs decreases in the presence of the spike protein. In the case of peptide-attached GQDs, the graphene quantum dots can bind with the spike protein via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding, and charge transfer interaction.18,19 On the other hand, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides can bind with the spike protein via hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and hydrophobic interaction.11,12,15 The observed huge fluorescence quenching clearly indicates the strong interaction between peptide-attached GQDs and the spike protein. The reported fluorescence quenching can be the result of the static quenching due to the formation of a nonfluorescent complex in the ground state. On the other hand, the observed quenching can be due to the dynamic quenching, which is based on the Förster resonance energy transfer from the donor peptide-attached GQDs to the acceptor spike protein. As reported in Figure 2D, the photoluminescence decay curve remains almost the same in the presence or absence of the delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein, which indicates that the fluorescence lifetime (τ1 = 0.30 ns, τ2 = 2.2 ns, and τ3 = 7.1 ns) in the presence of the spike protein is very similar to the data in the absence of the protein. The experimental lifetime data clearly indicates that the observed quenching is a static quenching process. Similarly, as reported in Figure S1E in the Supporting Information, the UV–vis absorption maximum from peptide-attached GQDs is ∼10 nm shifted to a higher wavelength in the presence of the spike protein, which also indicates the formation of a complex in the ground state between the peptide-attached GQDs and spike protein. Often, the static quenching process can be described by the Stern–Volmer equation20,22,24,25 as described below 1 2 where F0 is the fluorescence intensity from the peptide-conjugated GQDs in the absence of the spike protein, F is the fluorescence intensity in the presence of the spike protein, and [spike] is the protein concentration. KSV is the Stern–Volmer constant, which depends on quencher rate coefficients (Kq) and the lifetime τ0 of the GQDs’ excited state in the absence of spike. As shown in Figure 2E, the plot of log[F0/F] versus log[spike concentration, in nM] for HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs indicates the nonlinear fluorescence quenching process, which may be due to the multiple binding sites. Since we have observed a nonlinear Stern–Volmer quenching profile, we have used the modified Hill equation24,25 3 where Kb is the dissociation constant, [S]t is the concentration of the spike protein at any given time, [G]t is the concentration of peptide-conjugated GQDs at any given time, and n is the Hill coefficient. We have determined the binding affinity, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant, by fitting the curve with eq 3, as reported in Figures 2E,G. As shown in Table 1, we have determined the binding affinity as 8 ± 1 nM and n = 2.6. Table 1. Binding Affinity Measured by Fluorescence Quenching and ELISA Assays. system GQD-based fluorescence quenching ELISA-like assay LL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs 8 ± 1 nM 9 ± 1 nM LL-37-attached GQDs 12 ± 1 nM 13 ± 1 nM HNP1-attached GQDs 120 ± 20 nM 116 ± 20 nM LL-37 peptide 16 ± 1 nM HNP1 peptide 160 ± 40 nM ACE2 8 ± 1 nM GQDs 3.8 ± 0.6 μM 3.2 ± 0.5 μM Open in a new tabAs shown in Figures 2F,G, the luminescence signal from HNP1 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs decreases slowly as the concentration of the spike protein increases. By fitting the curve using eq 3, we have determined the binding affinity as 120 ± 20 nM in this case, as reported in Table 1. To verify our data with a well-documented assay, we used the ELISA-like assay using the His-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein.26,27 The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. As reported in Figure 2H, the plot shows the binding curve between the peptide-conjugated GQDs and spike protein in an ELISA plate-based assay. From the binding curve, we have estimated the binding affinity as 9 ± 1 nm for the delta variant spike with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-conjugated GQDs, which matches very well with the fluorescence quenching data. Similarly, we have estimated the binding affinity for the delta variant spike with different peptide-conjugated GQDs, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides and ACE2, as reported in Table 1. From the experimental data, we can conclude that the binding affinities for the delta variant spike with LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are comparable with that for ACE2-delta variant spike binding. Also, the binding affinities for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are better than only one type of peptide-attached GQDs. The observed higher binding affinity of GQDs conjugated with both the peptides (HNP and LL-37) than GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide can be due to the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike protein in the case of two peptide-attached GQDs. The reported theoretical modeling indicates that LL37 can bind to the spike-RBD in eight sites (LYS417, GLN493, THR500, ASN501, TYR505, THR500, ASN501, and GLY502).7,11 On the other hand, HNP1 can bind to the spike-RBD in six sites (LYS417, ALA475, PHE486, ASN487, TYR489, and GLN493).7,11 The observed higher binding may be due to the multiple binding site interaction. During the past three years of pandemic, several new viral lineages such as alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P1), delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants had risen.1−6 To understand how the binding affinity between LL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs and the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein RBD of different variants varies, we have determined the effects of RBD mutations on the binding capability with peptide-attached GQDs. As reported in Table 2, our experimental data indicate that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant spike-RBD is higher than those for the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD.

Demonstrating ACE2–Spike Protein Binding Blocking Using the B Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Virus Next, to find out whether LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs can bind with delta variant SARS-CoV-2, we have performed an experiment using Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. As shown in Figure 3A, the luminescence intensity from peptide-attached GQDs decreases abruptly in the presence of 1000 virus, which indicates that LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs can bind with Baculovirus pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. Figure 3. Open in a new tab (A) Fluorescence spectra from HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs in the presence and absence of GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein.

(D–H) Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to the surface of HEK-293T cells expressing ACE2. The green fluorescence is due to the presence of GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein on the surface of HEK-293T cells expressing ACE2. (D) Fluorescence image of HEK-293T cells in the presence of GFP-tagged pseudotyped delta virus without GQDs. (E) Bright-field image of HEK-293T cells in the presence of GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped without GQDs. (F) Fluorescence image of HEK-293T cells in the presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs. (G) Fluorescence image of HEK-293T cells in the presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 & HNP1 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs. (H) Bright-field image of HEK-293T cells in the presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 & HNP1 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs.As reported in Figure 3B,C, the TEM images indicate that peptide-conjugated GQDs are bound on the virus. Since the binding affinity for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than only HNP1-attached GQDs, we observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on the virus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After that, to determine whether HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking the spike protein RBD–ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T). For this experiment, we have used GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number #C1123G). The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.26,27 As shown in Figure 3D, in the absence of peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus binds with ACE2 on HEK-293T cells. The observed green fluorescence is due to the presence of GFP-tagged pseudotyped virus particles on the surface of HEK-293T cells via binding with ACE2. Figure 3E shows the bright-field image of HEK-293T cells, which indicates the presence of the pseudotyped virus on the cell surface. As shown in Figure 3H, in the presence of LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus cannot bind with ACE2 on HEK-293 T cells, and as a result, we have not observed any green fluorescence. Since LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have high binding affinity with the delta variant spike protein, the data shown above indicates that they can be used to completely block the binding between ACE2 and the spike protein. Due to the above fact, LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells. On the other hand, as reported in Figures 3F,G, LL-37 peptide-attached GQDs and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs cannot completely block the virus spike protein–ACE2 binding. As reported in Figure 4B, the blocking capability decreases from 100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used. Also, the blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding affinity, as reported in Table 1. Figure 4.

Determining the Inhibition Ability for LL-37 and HNP1 Peptide-Conjugated GQDs Using the B Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Virus Next, we have estimated the inhibition ability for delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions using peptide-conjugated GQDs. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.13,14,26,27Figure 4B shows the % inhibition, which clearly shows that 100% inhibition was achieved in the case of LL-37 (4 μg/mL) and HNP1 (4 μg/mL)-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL). On the other hand, less than the 10% inhibition was achieved when only GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. The reported data in Table 3 and Figure 4B also indicate that 70% inhibition can be achieved when LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. Similarly, using only the LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide, we have achieved 40% inhibition. From the reported inhibition data, we can conclude that the inhibition efficiencies for LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs are much higher than only one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptide or GQDs. To understand better about the above experimental observation, we have also performed TEM and SEM imaging experiments after LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs are exposed to the virus for 12 h. The SEM image in Figure 4C and the TEM image in Figure 4D clearly show that LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs can destroy the lipid membrane of Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. Due to the above fact, the delta variant virus collapses and spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane are removed. The above process helps to stop the spread of the delta variant virus.

Determining the Photoluminescence Quantum Yield and Lifetime from HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs The UV–vis spectra from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in Figure S2E, show two peaks. The first absorption peak is observed at ∼270 nm, which can be due to the π–π* transition, and the second peak is at ∼306 nm, which can be due to the n−π* transition.18−23Figure S2F and Figure 2C show the luminescence spectra of peptide-attached GQDs at 360 nm excitation, where the strong emission maximum at 416 nm can be due to the electron–hole recombination and quantum size effect.18−23Figure 2B shows that peptide-attached GQDs exhibit a strong blue fluorescence under UV light. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was determined to be ∼0.28 for peptide-attached GQDs. The photoluminescence decay profiles for peptide-attached GQDs are reported in Figure 2D, which fit very well with the triple exponential function with τ1 = 0.32 ns, τ2 = 2.2 ns, and τ3 = 7.3 ns. 3.2. Determining the Biocompatibility and Cytotoxicity To determine the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, we used normal skin HaCaT cells, lung cancer A549 cells, and human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T).11−15,26,27 All cells were treated with 60 μg/mL GQDs + 4 μg/mL LL-37 + 4 μg/mL HNP1 for 48 h.11−15,26,27 As reported in Figures S3A,B in the Supporting Information, after treatment with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs or only GQDs or only peptides, the cell viability was hardly changed for all the cell lines. The reported experimental data clearly indicate that the LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs do not exhibit any detectable cytotoxicity after 48 h of treatment. 3.3. Determining the Binding Affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs Next, we have determined whether the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD can bind with HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, which is a very important parameter for the inhibition of virus infection. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. The luminescence signals from GQDs in the presence and absence of the spike protein were recorded with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser.11−15,26,27 The reported photograph in Figure 2B also shows that the intense fluorescence from peptide-conjugated GQDs decreases in the presence of the spike protein. In the case of peptide-attached GQDs, the graphene quantum dots can bind with the spike protein via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding, and charge transfer interaction.18,19 On the other hand, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides can bind with the spike protein via hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and hydrophobic interaction.11,12,15 The observed huge fluorescence quenching clearly indicates the strong interaction between peptide-attached GQDs and the spike protein. The reported fluorescence quenching can be the result of the static quenching due to the formation of a nonfluorescent complex in the ground state. On the other hand, the observed quenching can be due to the dynamic quenching, which is based on the Förster resonance energy transfer from the donor peptide-attached GQDs to the acceptor spike protein. As reported in Figure 2D, the photoluminescence decay curve remains almost the same in the presence or absence of the delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein, which indicates that the fluorescence lifetime (τ1 = 0.30 ns, τ2 = 2.2 ns, and τ3 = 7.1 ns) in the presence of the spike protein is very similar to the data in the absence of the protein. The experimental lifetime data clearly indicates that the observed quenching is a static quenching process. Similarly, as reported in Figure S1E in the Supporting Information, the UV–vis absorption maximum from peptide-attached GQDs is ∼10 nm shifted to a higher wavelength in the presence of the spike protein, which also indicates the formation of a complex in the ground state between the peptide-attached GQDs and spike protein. Often, the static quenching process can be described by the Stern–Volmer equation20,22,24,25 as described below 1 2 where F0 is the fluorescence intensity from the peptide-conjugated GQDs in the absence of the spike protein, F is the fluorescence intensity in the presence of the spike protein, and [spike] is the protein concentration. KSV is the Stern–Volmer constant, which depends on quencher rate coefficients (Kq) and the lifetime τ0 of the GQDs’ excited state in the absence of spike. As shown in Figure 2E, the plot of log[F0/F] versus log[spike concentration, in nM] for HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs indicates the nonlinear fluorescence quenching process, which may be due to the multiple binding sites. Since we have observed a nonlinear Stern–Volmer quenching profile, we have used the modified Hill equation24,25 3 where Kb is the dissociation constant, [S]t is the concentration of the spike protein at any given time, [G]t is the concentration of peptide-conjugated GQDs at any given time, and n is the Hill coefficient. We have determined the binding affinity, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant, by fitting the curve with eq 3, as reported in Figures 2E,G. As shown in Table 1, we have determined the binding affinity as 8 ± 1 nM and n = 2.6. Table 1. Binding Affinity Measured by Fluorescence Quenching and ELISA Assays. system GQD-based fluorescence quenching ELISA-like assay LL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs 8 ± 1 nM 9 ± 1 nM LL-37-attached GQDs 12 ± 1 nM 13 ± 1 nM HNP1-attached GQDs 120 ± 20 nM 116 ± 20 nM LL-37 peptide 16 ± 1 nM HNP1 peptide 160 ± 40 nM ACE2 8 ± 1 nM GQDs 3.8 ± 0.6 μM 3.2 ± 0.5 μM Open in a new tabAs shown in Figures 2F,G, the luminescence signal from HNP1 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs decreases slowly as the concentration of the spike protein increases. By fitting the curve using eq 3, we have determined the binding affinity as 120 ± 20 nM in this case, as reported in Table 1. To verify our data with a well-documented assay, we used the ELISA-like assay using the His-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein.26,27 The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. As reported in Figure 2H, the plot shows the binding curve between the peptide-conjugated GQDs and spike protein in an ELISA plate-based assay. From the binding curve, we have estimated the binding affinity as 9 ± 1 nm for the delta variant spike with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-conjugated GQDs, which matches very well with the fluorescence quenching data. Similarly, we have estimated the binding affinity for the delta variant spike with different peptide-conjugated GQDs, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides and ACE2, as reported in Table 1. From the experimental data, we can conclude that the binding affinities for the delta variant spike with LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are comparable with that for ACE2-delta variant spike binding. Also, the binding affinities for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are better than only one type of peptide-attached GQDs. The observed higher binding affinity of GQDs conjugated with both the peptides (HNP and LL-37) than GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide can be due to the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike protein in the case of two peptide-attached GQDs. The reported theoretical modeling indicates that LL37 can bind to the spike-RBD in eight sites (LYS417, GLN493, THR500, ASN501, TYR505, THR500, ASN501, and GLY502).7,11 On the other hand, HNP1 can bind to the spike-RBD in six sites (LYS417, ALA475, PHE486, ASN487, TYR489, and GLN493).7,11 The observed higher binding may be due to the multiple binding site interaction. During the past three years of pandemic, several new viral lineages such as alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P1), delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants had risen.1−6 To understand how the binding affinity between LL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs and the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein RBD of different variants varies, we have determined the effects of RBD mutations on the binding capability with peptide-attached GQDs. As reported in Table 2, our experimental data indicate that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant spike-RBD is higher than those for the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD.

Demonstrating ACE2–Spike Protein Binding Blocking Using the B Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Virus Next, to find out whether LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs can bind with delta variant SARS-CoV-2, we have performed an experiment using Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. As shown in Figure 3A, the luminescence intensity from peptide-attached GQDs decreases abruptly in the presence of 1000 virus, which indicates that LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs can bind with Baculovirus pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. Figure 3.

(H) Bright-field image of HEK-293T cells in the presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 & HNP1 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs.As reported in Figure 3B,C, the TEM images indicate that peptide-conjugated GQDs are bound on the virus. Since the binding affinity for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than only HNP1-attached GQDs, we observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on the virus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After that, to determine whether HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking the spike protein RBD–ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T). For this experiment, we have used GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number #C1123G). The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.26,27 As shown in Figure 3D, in the absence of peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus binds with ACE2 on HEK-293T cells. The observed green fluorescence is due to the presence of GFP-tagged pseudotyped virus particles on the surface of HEK-293T cells via binding with ACE2. Figure 3E shows the bright-field image of HEK-293T cells, which indicates the presence of the pseudotyped virus on the cell surface. As shown in Figure 3H, in the presence of LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus cannot bind with ACE2 on HEK-293 T cells, and as a result, we have not observed any green fluorescence. Since LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have high binding affinity with the delta variant spike protein, the data shown above indicates that they can be used to completely block the binding between ACE2 and the spike protein. Due to the above fact, LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells. On the other hand, as reported in Figures 3F,G, LL-37 peptide-attached GQDs and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs cannot completely block the virus spike protein–ACE2 binding. As reported in Figure 4B, the blocking capability decreases from 100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used. Also, the blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding affinity, as reported in Table 1. Figure 4.

The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.13,14,26,27Figure 4B shows the % inhibition, which clearly shows that 100% inhibition was achieved in the case of LL-37 (4 μg/mL) and HNP1 (4 μg/mL)-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL). On the other hand, less than the 10% inhibition was achieved when only GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. The reported data in Table 3 and Figure 4B also indicate that 70% inhibition can be achieved when LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. Similarly, using only the LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide, we have achieved 40% inhibition.

Due to the above fact, the delta variant virus collapses and spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane are removed. The above process helps to stop the spread of the delta variant virus.

Conclusions In conclusion, in the current article, we show that HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs can be used to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells by blocking spike protein RBD binding with ACE2.

Copyright notice ID: 8886715 PMID: 35252734 Abstract The emergence of double mutation delta (B.1.617.2) variants has dropped vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil α-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding with host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant spike protein, the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly. Experimental quenching data shows a nonlinear Stern–Volmer quenching profile, which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the modified Hill equation, we have determined n = 2.6 and the effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, experimental data shows that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells via blocking the ACE2–spike protein binding. Experimental data shows that the inhibition efficiency for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than that of only one type of peptide-attached GQDs.1. Introduction The current global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for over 5.4 million death till now.1−4 It is now well understood that during COVID-19 infection, the spike protein S1 unit containing the receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) facilitates the virus attachment to humans by binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the nasal epithelial mucosal cells, which is the key path for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells.5−9 Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein became the target for COVID-19 vaccines available in the market, which can generate neutralizing antibodies against the S-RBD upon immunization.9−14 The emergence of double mutant delta (B.1.617.2) variants, which contain the L452R and T478K mutations on the S-RBD, has enhanced the binding affinity with ACE2.1−6 Recent reports also indicate that mutations on the S-RBD lead to a prominent decline in neutralizing antibody levels against the delta variant by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination.7−12 Due to the above fact, designing a new strategy to block the spike protein–ACE interaction is very important for preventing mutate variant infection. Although the mortality rate is very high for COVID-19, reported data also indicates that around 42% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively controlled by the human’s innate immune system.1−9 α-Defensin human neutrophil peptides (HNP1, HNP2, HNP3, and HNP4) and human β-defensins (HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3) as well as LL-37 (leucine-leucine-37) cathelicidin family peptides are members of the innate immune system.11,15−17 Defensins and cathelicidin peptides play a crucial role in the human body for viral inhibition via binding and destabilizing.11,15−17 Driven by the need to block the delta variant infection, herein we report the design of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which have the capability to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD and block the S-RBD interaction with ACE2, which prevents the virus entry into the host cells, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.

(B) Scheme showing the blocking of the S-RBD interaction with ACE2 on a human cell membrane and preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus entry.Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) consisting of a graphene lattice and containing single or few sheets of graphene fragments exhibit size-dependent luminescence properties originating from the quantum confinement effects and edge effects.18−23 GQDs containing different surface groups such as carboxy, epoxy, and hydroxyl exhibit a high water solubility, high surface area, excellent photostability, and biocompatibility.18−23 Due to their unique optical and other properties, GQDs became a very good choice for use in bioimaging, biosensing, and other biotechnology applications.18−23 In our design, bioconjugated GQD fluorescence has been used to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD–host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction to determine the effective binding affinity. Also, the functional groups on the surface and edge of GQDs have been used for the inactivation of the virus via decomposition of the lipid membrane of the virus and for the removal of spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Synthesis and Characterization of HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs) GQDs were developed in a two-step process, as shown in Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information. Initially, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were synthesized from natural graphite powder using the modified Hummer’s method as we and others have reported before.18−23 In the next step, GQDs were synthesized using a hydrothermal method in the presence of dimethyl formamide (DMF).18−23 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image reported in Figure S2A in the Supporting Information shows the two-dimensional (2D) morphology of the freshly prepared GO with 5 ± 2 μm size. On the other hand, the TEM image reported in Figure S2B shows the zero-dimensional (0D) morphology of the freshly prepared GQDs whose sizes are 4 ± 2 nm. Table S1 shows the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement data, which matches well with the TEM data. As shown in Figure 1A, for the development of HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, we used carbodiimide coupling chemistry between the carboxy group of graphene oxides and the amine group of peptides. The FTIR data from peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in Figure S2G, shows the presence of the −OH stretch, −CH stretch, −amide-I, −amide-II, and −amide-III bands, which indicates that the peptides are attached on the GQD surfaces. The DLS data indicates the ζ-potential changes from −14 ± 2 mV to 3 ± 1 mV after peptide binding, which also indicates that the peptides are on the surface of GQDs. The TEM data reported in Figure 2A indicates that the size of peptide-conjugated GQDs are 6 ± 2 nm, which matches very well with the DLS data reported in Table S1. The inset in Figure 2A shows the high-resolution TEM for peptide-conjugated GQDs, which shows the graphite structure with a stripe distance of ∼0.24 nm.18−23 Similarly, Figure S2C in the Supporting Information shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, which indicates a broad peak at 26.5° due to the (002) reflection of graphite.18−23Figure S2D shows the Raman spectra of peptide-attached GQDs, which indicate the presence of the D band at ∼1350 cm–1 and the G band at ∼1590 cm–1 due to the graphene structure.18−23 Figure 2.

Binding Studies between the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs Using Peptide-Attached GQD-Based Luminescence For the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD and HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, we used a binding buffer. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. For the detection of luminescence from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, in the presence and absence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD, we used a portable fluorescence spectrometer developed by us with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser.13,14,21,22 For emission signal collection, we used a miniaturized QE65000 spectrometer from Ocean Optics.13,14,21,22 All measurements were performed with 5 ms integration time with five spectra averaging using the software.13,14,21,222.3. ELISA-like Assay for Determining the Binding between the Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein and Peptide-Attached GQDs For this purpose, we used an ELISA-like assay using His-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins, which were adsorbed to a 96-well plate overnight at 4 °C. For comparison with fluorescence assay data, we kept the concentrations of GQDs and spike proteins the same for both the measurements. After that, the plate was blocked using a blocking buffer and then different concentrations of peptide-attached GQDs were incubated on the plate. In the next step, we used a streptavidin protein that is covalently conjugated to a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme to determine the binding.11−15 We also used TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) for colorimetric assay detection.11−15 Signal intensity was recorded using a plate reader. After that, data were graphed in GraphPad Prism. From the binding curve, we estimated the binding constants (KD) using the Hill equation, as reported before.7,8,11,122.4. In Vitro Experiments for Blocking ACE2 Binding with Baculovirus Pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein Using Fluorescence Imaging For this experiment, we used human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T).11−15,26,27 Since delta variant SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, for our experiment, we used a GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number #C1123G).11−15,26,27 The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.2.5. Virus Inhibition Experiments for HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs For this experiment, we used HEK293T cells. Dilutions of test HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs were made in DMEM.13,14,26,27 The GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein stock was mixed with the HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs at different concentrations and incubated for 1 h. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Determining the Photoluminescence Quantum Yield and Lifetime from HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs The UV–vis spectra from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in Figure S2E, show two peaks. The first absorption peak is observed at ∼270 nm, which can be due to the π–π* transition, and the second peak is at ∼306 nm, which can be due to the n−π* transition.18−23Figure S2F and Figure 2C show the luminescence spectra of peptide-attached GQDs at 360 nm excitation, where the strong emission maximum at 416 nm can be due to the electron–hole recombination and quantum size effect.18−23Figure 2B shows that peptide-attached GQDs exhibit a strong blue fluorescence under UV light. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was determined to be ∼0.28 for peptide-attached GQDs. The photoluminescence decay profiles for peptide-attached GQDs are reported in Figure 2D, which fit very well with the triple exponential function with τ1 = 0.32 ns, τ2 = 2.2 ns, and τ3 = 7.3 ns.3.2. Determining the Biocompatibility and Cytotoxicity To determine the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, we used normal skin HaCaT cells, lung cancer A549 cells, and human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T).11−15,26,27 All cells were treated with 60 μg/mL GQDs + 4 μg/mL LL-37 + 4 μg/mL HNP1 for 48 h.11−15,26,27 As reported in Figures S3A,B in the Supporting Information, after treatment with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs or only GQDs or only peptides, the cell viability was hardly changed for all the cell lines. The reported experimental data clearly indicate that the LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs do not exhibit any detectable cytotoxicity after 48 h of treatment.3.3. Determining the Binding Affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs Next, we have determined whether the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD can bind with HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, which is a very important parameter for the inhibition of virus infection. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. The luminescence signals from GQDs in the presence and absence of the spike protein were recorded with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser.11−15,26,27 The reported photograph in Figure 2B also shows that the intense fluorescence from peptide-conjugated GQDs decreases in the presence of the spike protein. In the case of peptide-attached GQDs, the graphene quantum dots can bind with the spike protein via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding, and charge transfer interaction.18,19 On the other hand, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides can bind with the spike protein via hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and hydrophobic interaction.11,12,15 The observed huge fluorescence quenching clearly indicates the strong interaction between peptide-attached GQDs and the spike protein. The reported fluorescence quenching can be the result of the static quenching due to the formation of a nonfluorescent complex in the ground state. On the other hand, the observed quenching can be due to the dynamic quenching, which is based on the Förster resonance energy transfer from the donor peptide-attached GQDs to the acceptor spike protein. As reported in Figure 2D, the photoluminescence decay curve remains almost the same in the presence or absence of the delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein, which indicates that the fluorescence lifetime (τ1 = 0.30 ns, τ2 = 2.2 ns, and τ3 = 7.1 ns) in the presence of the spike protein is very similar to the data in the absence of the protein. The experimental lifetime data clearly indicates that the observed quenching is a static quenching process. Similarly, as reported in Figure S1E in the Supporting Information, the UV–vis absorption maximum from peptide-attached GQDs is ∼10 nm shifted to a higher wavelength in the presence of the spike protein, which also indicates the formation of a complex in the ground state between the peptide-attached GQDs and spike protein. Often, the static quenching process can be described by the Stern–Volmer equation20,22,24,25 as described below 1 2 where F0 is the fluorescence intensity from the peptide-conjugated GQDs in the absence of the spike protein, F is the fluorescence intensity in the presence of the spike protein, and [spike] is the protein concentration. KSV is the Stern–Volmer constant, which depends on quencher rate coefficients (Kq) and the lifetime τ0 of the GQDs’ excited state in the absence of spike. As shown in Figure 2E, the plot of log[F0/F] versus log[spike concentration, in nM] for HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs indicates the nonlinear fluorescence quenching process, which may be due to the multiple binding sites. Since we have observed a nonlinear Stern–Volmer quenching profile, we have used the modified Hill equation24,25 3 where Kb is the dissociation constant, [S]t is the concentration of the spike protein at any given time, [G]t is the concentration of peptide-conjugated GQDs at any given time, and n is the Hill coefficient. We have determined the binding affinity, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant, by fitting the curve with eq 3, as reported in Figures 2E,G. As shown in Table 1, we have determined the binding affinity as 8 ± 1 nM and n = 2.6. Table 1. Binding Affinity Measured by Fluorescence Quenching and ELISA Assays. system GQD-based fluorescence quenching ELISA-like assay LL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs 8 ± 1 nM 9 ± 1 nM LL-37-attached GQDs 12 ± 1 nM 13 ± 1 nM HNP1-attached GQDs 120 ± 20 nM 116 ± 20 nM LL-37 peptide 16 ± 1 nM HNP1 peptide 160 ± 40 nM ACE2 8 ± 1 nM GQDs 3.8 ± 0.6 μM 3.2 ± 0.5 μM Open in a new tabAs shown in Figures 2F,G, the luminescence signal from HNP1 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs decreases slowly as the concentration of the spike protein increases. By fitting the curve using eq 3, we have determined the binding affinity as 120 ± 20 nM in this case, as reported in Table 1. To verify our data with a well-documented assay, we used the ELISA-like assay using the His-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein.26,27 The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. As reported in Figure 2H, the plot shows the binding curve between the peptide-conjugated GQDs and spike protein in an ELISA plate-based assay. From the binding curve, we have estimated the binding affinity as 9 ± 1 nm for the delta variant spike with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-conjugated GQDs, which matches very well with the fluorescence quenching data. Similarly, we have estimated the binding affinity for the delta variant spike with different peptide-conjugated GQDs, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides and ACE2, as reported in Table 1. From the experimental data, we can conclude that the binding affinities for the delta variant spike with LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are comparable with that for ACE2-delta variant spike binding. Also, the binding affinities for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are better than only one type of peptide-attached GQDs. The observed higher binding affinity of GQDs conjugated with both the peptides (HNP and LL-37) than GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide can be due to the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike protein in the case of two peptide-attached GQDs. The reported theoretical modeling indicates that LL37 can bind to the spike-RBD in eight sites (LYS417, GLN493, THR500, ASN501, TYR505, THR500, ASN501, and GLY502).7,11 On the other hand, HNP1 can bind to the spike-RBD in six sites (LYS417, ALA475, PHE486, ASN487, TYR489, and GLN493).7,11 The observed higher binding may be due to the multiple binding site interaction. During the past three years of pandemic, several new viral lineages such as alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P1), delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants had risen.1−6 To understand how the binding affinity between LL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs and the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein RBD of different variants varies, we have determined the effects of RBD mutations on the binding capability with peptide-attached GQDs. As reported in Table 2, our experimental data indicate that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant spike-RBD is higher than those for the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD.

Demonstrating ACE2–Spike Protein Binding Blocking Using the B Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Virus Next, to find out whether LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs can bind with delta variant SARS-CoV-2, we have performed an experiment using Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. As shown in Figure 3A, the luminescence intensity from peptide-attached GQDs decreases abruptly in the presence of 1000 virus, which indicates that LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs can bind with Baculovirus pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. Figure 3. Open in a new tab (A) Fluorescence spectra from HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs in the presence and absence of GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein.

(G) Fluorescence image of HEK-293T cells in the presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 & HNP1 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs. (H) Bright-field image of HEK-293T cells in the presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 & HNP1 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs.As reported in Figure 3B,C, the TEM images indicate that peptide-conjugated GQDs are bound on the virus. Since the binding affinity for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than only HNP1-attached GQDs, we observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on the virus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After that, to determine whether HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking the spike protein RBD–ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T). For this experiment, we have used GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number #C1123G). The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.26,27 As shown in Figure 3D, in the absence of peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus binds with ACE2 on HEK-293T cells. The observed green fluorescence is due to the presence of GFP-tagged pseudotyped virus particles on the surface of HEK-293T cells via binding with ACE2. Figure 3E shows the bright-field image of HEK-293T cells, which indicates the presence of the pseudotyped virus on the cell surface. As shown in Figure 3H, in the presence of LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus cannot bind with ACE2 on HEK-293 T cells, and as a result, we have not observed any green fluorescence. Since LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have high binding affinity with the delta variant spike protein, the data shown above indicates that they can be used to completely block the binding between ACE2 and the spike protein. Due to the above fact, LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells. On the other hand, as reported in Figures 3F,G, LL-37 peptide-attached GQDs and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs cannot completely block the virus spike protein–ACE2 binding. As reported in Figure 4B, the blocking capability decreases from 100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used. Also, the blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding affinity, as reported in Table 1. Figure 4.

Determining the Inhibition Ability for LL-37 and HNP1 Peptide-Conjugated GQDs Using the B Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Virus Next, we have estimated the inhibition ability for delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions using peptide-conjugated GQDs. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.13,14,26,27Figure 4B shows the % inhibition, which clearly shows that 100% inhibition was achieved in the case of LL-37 (4 μg/mL) and HNP1 (4 μg/mL)-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL). On the other hand, less than the 10% inhibition was achieved when only GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. The reported data in Table 3 and Figure 4B also indicate that 70% inhibition can be achieved when LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. Similarly, using only the LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide, we have achieved 40% inhibition. From the reported inhibition data, we can conclude that the inhibition efficiencies for LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs are much higher than only one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptide or GQDs. To understand better about the above experimental observation, we have also performed TEM and SEM imaging experiments after LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs are exposed to the virus for 12 h. The SEM image in Figure 4C and the TEM image in Figure 4D clearly show that LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs can destroy the lipid membrane of Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. Due to the above fact, the delta variant virus collapses and spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane are removed. The above process helps to stop the spread of the delta variant virus.

Conclusions In conclusion, in the current article, we show that HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs can be used to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells by blocking spike protein RBD binding with ACE2. We have demonstrated that peptide-attached GQD-based fluorescence quenching can be used for determining the binding affinity of the delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. The reported experimental data show that the effective binding affinity between the HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs and delta variant spike protein is comparable with the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity. Using the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, we have shown that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for other variants. Our experimental observation using the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line demonstrated that LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells and the inhibition efficiency for two peptide-attached GQDs is much higher than those for only one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptides or GQDs.Acknowledgments P.C.R. thanks NSF-RAPID grant no.

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Intranasally administered unfractionated heparin (UFH) and other sulfated polysaccharides are potential prophylactics for COVID-19. The purpose of this research was to measure the safety and pharmacokinetics of clearance of intranasally administered UFH solution from the nasal cavity.Methods Double-blinded daily intranasal dosing in C57Bl6 mice with four doses (60 ng to 60 μg) of UFH was carried out for fourteen consecutive days, with both blood coagulation measurements and subject adverse event monitoring. The pharmacokinetics of fluorescent-labeled UFH clearance from the nasal cavity were measured in mice by in vivo imaging. Intranasal UFH at 2000 U/day solution with nasal spray device was tested for safety in a small number of healthy human subjects.Results UFH showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any dose measured. No significant changes were observed in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, or frequency of minor irritant events over vehicle-only control. Human subjects showed no significant changes in aPTT time, international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count over baseline measurements. No serious adverse events were observed. In vivo imaging in a mouse model showed a single phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity. After 12 h, 3.2% of the administered UFH remained in the nasal cavity, decaying to background levels by 48 h.Conclusions UFH showed no toxic effects for extended daily intranasal dosing in mice as well as humans. The clearance kinetics of intranasal heparin solution from the nasal cavity indicates potentially protective levels for up to 12 h after dosing.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11095-022-03191-4.KEY WORDS: Covid-19, heparin, intranasal delivery, SARS-CoV-2",
    "introduction": "Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to severe social and economic consequences spanning the entire world (1, 2). Despite active vaccination programs and implementation of social distancing parameters, the number of infections and deaths in the world remain significantly high and new highly transmissible strains are emerging (3). SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic betacoronavirus (4) transmitted via person to person mainly through air droplets (5) and sometimes fecal-oral routes (6), potentially infecting nasal, lung, and intestinal tissues (7). Currently, there are no highly effective therapeutics to treat COVID-19, making effective prevention an essential public health goal. SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is initiated by molecular interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (also known as S-protein) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) displayed on the host cell surfaces (8–11). Several viruses from different virus families are known to utilize HSPG as their attachment receptors (12), for example, parainfluenza (13), adenovirus (14–16), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (17, 18), cytomegalovirus (16, 19), and herpes simplex virus (20). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the S-protein-HSPG interaction is followed by binding of S-protein to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (21–26). Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to host HSPG is essential for the progression of virus entry and infection cycle, as evidenced by disruption of virus entry by exogenously administered sulfated polysaccharides, which compete with cell surface HSPGs. The sulfated polysaccharides that have already been investigated as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents include heparin, heparin derivatives and glycosaminoglycan analogs (9, 10, 27). These sulfated polysaccharides are likely to remain effective against emerging variants of concern (VOC) that partially evade vaccine-induced immune response due to differences in polysaccharide and antibody binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (10) and the conserved nature of the polybasic furin cleavage site, one of the major sites of heparin interaction and activity (28). Since the major route of virus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly initiated by airborne droplet infection of nasal tissues, it is reasonable to consider the design of potentially novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, like UFH, for intranasal administration (9, 11). Such an approach may lead to the discovery of novel anticoronaviral agents with high efficacy, fast mechanisms of action, wide therapeutic windows, and non-invasive self-administration protocols for a possible prophylactic use. While heparin administration by injection is already FDA-approved for other uses, potential antiviral utility against coronaviruses is just being explored. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of UFH, particularly regarding the potential consequences of repeated administration to the nasal cavity. Preliminary tests regarding clearance, pharmacokinetics, and safety must be undertaken prior to implementing the actual clinical nasal application of a potentially useful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, like heparin, which is already FDA-approved for use by administration via other routes. In this work, a series of in vivo pharmacological and toxicological aspects of intranasally administered UFH in mice were investigated. Blood histology, coagulation, olfactory behavior, drug clearance, and adverse outcomes were assessed in mice, and safety was evaluated in a small healthy human sample population. Primary objectives for the human study were the measurement of systemic bioavailability based on increased blood coagulation properties using aPTT and INR measurements. Platelet count was also observed to detect any potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Finally, episodes of epistaxis were monitored to measure for localized damage to mucus membranes and/or localized anti-coagulation activity. Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that the intranasal administration of UFH solution will readily deliver the UFH to the nasal passages and will be safe with no or minimal toxic effects in mice or humans. Results indicate efficient delivery, extended retention of heparin in the nasal passages, and clearance of intranasally administered UFH with no major adverse effects.",
    "methods": "Methods Materials Heparin Sodium Injection, USP was purchased in two different formulations for human intranasal administration: 5000 USP units per mL (NDC: 71288–403-10) and 10,000 USP units per mL (NDC: 00409–2721-30). Heparin sodium salt from porcine intestinal mucosa (≥ 180 U/mg) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used without further purification. CF680R dye was obtained from Biotium (Fremont, CA). Reagents for aPTT analysis were obtained from Pacific Hemostasis. aPTT times were measured on a KC4 coagulometer (Sigma Amelung). Other chemicals were purchased from VWR International (Radnor, PA). The U line S-20037C – 1 Oz Glass Dropper Bottles with pump (100 μl per spray) was provided by Brister’s H & W Compounding Pharmacy, Grenada, MS. Preparation of Heparin Product All formulation steps were performed under a Biosafety cabinet hood in BSL-2 level laboratory. For animal studies, diluent medium was prepared using 39.6 mL of sterile milliQ water, 0.4 mL benzyl alcohol, and 0.36 g of NaCl. The pH of the diluent was adjusted to 6.2, and the diluent solution was filtered using a 0.2 μm filter. A stock solution of 5 mg/mL of heparin was prepared by dissolving 10.5 mg of dry heparin sodium in 2 mL of diluent solution. The stock solution was then serially diluted 10x using the diluent medium to prepare specified doses of heparin. For human studies, heparin sodium injection at either 5000 U/mL (NDC: 71288–402-10) or 10,000 U/mL (NDC: 00406–2721-30) was transferred into glass intranasal U line S-20037C – 1 Oz Glass Dropper spray bottles with a 100 μL actuator (Aptar Pharma, Congers NY) under sterile conditions. The intranasal spray bottles were verified to dispense 0.1 mL of heparin solution per pump. Animals All procedures were approved by the University of Mississippi Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #19–009) or the University of Mississippi Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #1571). Toxicology experiments were performed on wild-type male (19-23 g) and female (16-19 g) C57BL6 mice from Envigo (Indianapolis, IN) in study groups of six mice for each dose (three male, three female). The study was powered to preserve an 80% chance of not committing a Type II error with a 5% chance of Type I error at significant effect sizes (weight as the variable: power > 0.8 to detect a 20% change in body weight within sex (n = 3), 10% change in body weight within entire group (n = 6); aPTT time: power > 0.8 to detect a 100% change in aPTT (n = 4); buried food recovery time: power > 0.8 to detect a 100% change in recovery time (n = 5)). No data were excluded from analysis. In vivo imaging experiments were performed on six (three male, three female) SKH1-Elite mice (Crl:SKH1-Hrhr Outbred: Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). One female mouse exhibited poor response to the anesthetic resulting in significant movement during imaging, so data for this mouse were excluded from the nasal clearance kinetics modeling. All animals for toxicology studies were housed in the AALAC-accredited University of Mississippi Animal Facility and given access to rodent chow (Cat.# 7001, Envigo Teklad 4% Fat Rodent Diet) and tap water ad libitum for the duration of the experiments. Mice were group-housed (3–4 mice/cage) in climate-controlled rooms (30–40% relative humidity, 21–23°C) under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 06:00). All mice were acclimated to the vivarium colony room for five days prior to initiating the drug administration regimen. Upon completion of the study, mice were anesthetized with vaporized isofluorane, perfused with phosphate buffer saline, and secondarily euthanized with decapitation. Tissues of interest were examined, weighed, and fixed in buffered 4% formalin. The left liver lobes were embedded in 30% sucrose (Sigma, S9378) overnight at 4°C and frozen in optimal cutting temperature for cryosectioning (Leica CM 3050S) at −15°C. Serial slices (10 μm) were transferred to superfrost coated glass slides and stained following standard H&E protocols (dehydrated with alcohol, stained in hematoxylin for 2 min, rinsed, differentiated in 70% alcohol and then subsequently stained in 0.01% eosin Y for 30 s, rinsed in 95% ethanol, dehydrated with absolute ethanol and cleared in three xylene washes). Entire hepatic cross-sections were imaged (40x) and stitched (10% overlap) using an HCA Nikon Ti2-E microscope and assessed by a blinded observer. Intranasal (IN) Drug Delivery Mice were transferred to a surgical suite each day and weighed prior to inhaled anesthesia induction with up to 5% isofluorane. Mice were then administered 6 μL per nostril of Heparin solution at concentrations from 5 to 5000 mg/L using a micropipette timed to inspiration. Mice were returned to their home cage and were monitored during recovery (less than 5 min). Drug was administered each morning (08:00–12:00) for 14 consecutive days. Signs of inflammation, bleeding, and/or nasal discharge were monitored twice daily by visual inspection of the nose, body, cage, and bedding. Images of the nose were taken prior to administration, one week into administration, and on the 14th day of administration for further visual analyses of inflammation or irritation. Olfaction Assessment The Buried Food Test was used to assess the ability to smell volatile odors following the 14-day regimen of IN administration. Mice were habituated to the food stimulus of choice, Teddy Grahams (Nabisco, Hanover, New Jersey), at least 24-h prior to behavioral testing to confirm its rewarding stimulus. Mice were food deprived (water ad lib) immediately following Day 14 of IN drug administration to motivate subjects, and tested 24-h later (signs of distress were monitored while food deprived). On test day, the subject was placed in a test chamber containing 3 cm of fresh 1/8 in corncob bedding for a 15-min trial, with the food stimulus buried approximately 1 cm below the bedding surface in a randomly assigned corner of the cage. The subject successfully completed the assay when it uncovered the food stimulus and began to eat, using one or both forepaws on the food. Latency to uncover and eat the food served as the dependent measure. Each trial had a maximum latency of 900 s. Immediately following testing, mice were returned to their home cage, and ad lib access to food was restored. Blood Histology At the time of exsanguination, 20 μL of whole blood was removed and smeared on coverglass for histological assessment. The smears were air dried and stained with Wright’s Blood Stain (Fisher, #9513306), washed 3 times, and dried for microscopic imaging. Only the highest heparin dose was analyzed for platelet count. Five fields per sample were imaged at random at 600x phase contrast using a Nikon Ti2-E Microscope. Platelets in each image were counted by a blinded observer. aPTT Measurements Activated partial thromboplastin time assay (aPTT) was performed by incubating 50 μL of test animal plasma with 50 μL of control reference plasma. Following this, 100 μL of aPTT reagent was added and the individual mixtures were further incubated for five minutes at 37°C. Clotting time was measured in seconds immediately following the addition of 100 μL of 25 mM CaCl2. For control values, heparin was added directly to 100 μL of reference plasma at a defined concentration (U/mL), aPTT reagent was added and the aPTT assay performed as described. In Vivo Imaging of Intranasal Heparin Product CF680R-heparin was generated by conjugating the free reducing-end of heparin with the aminooxy group of the CF680R. Briefly, 50 μM of heparin (EMD Millipore) stock solution was prepared in 100 mM sodium phosphate and 1.5 M sodium chloride (pH 7.4). 5 mM of CF680R (Biotium) stock solution was prepared in water. 150 μL of 5 mM CF680R was added to 300 μL of 50 μM heparin. The molar ratio of heparin and CF680R was 1:50. 45 μL of aniline was added to catalyze the reaction. The mixture was reacted at room temperature overnight in the dark. The conjugate was purified by a 3 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore Sigma) at 13,000×g for 30 min, followed by three washes with 400 μL of water at 13,000×g for 30 min. The final sample was further purified by HPLC size exclusion chromatography using a 4.6 mm × 300 mm ACQUITY BEH SEC column (Waters). Sample was analyzed using an isocratic gradient of 40 mM sodium acetate in 20% methanol at a flow rate of 100 μL/min and detection by UV absorbance at 680 nm. CF680R-heparin (excitation maximum = 680 nm; emission maximum = 701 nm) was resuspended in 1X PBS (600μg/72 μl) and administered at 1 μl per nostril (1.67 μg total) in the mouse anesthetized with 3% isoflurane initially and maintaining anesthesia with 1% isoflurane. Images were acquired on an IVIS Spectrum animal imager system using Living Image® Software (Perkin Elmer). Images were captured before administration of heparin and at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 5 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h post administration. Quantification was performed by manual definition of the nasal cavity followed by software quantification of IR fluorescence average radiant efficiency in the defined area. Background IR intensity was obtained pre-dosing for each animal and subtracted from each time point. Each replicate was normalized to the intensity of nasal IR fluorescence measured five minutes post-dose for each animal. One-phase and two-phase exponential decay modeling was carried out using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 and hypothesis testing using an extra sum-of-squares F test was performed. As the p value for the comparison of fits measurement was not below 0.05 (p = 0.37) and gains in the goodness of fit parameters were minimal for the two-phase decay model (R2 = .77 for the one-phase model versus .78 for the two-phase model), the simpler model was chosen. Statistical Analysis Prior to the initiation of treatment, all mice were thoroughly examined for abnormalities and one mouse with a blunted nose was removed and replaced. Drug was assigned to the mice using block randomization for equal group size and drug doses were coded to ensure administration and outcome assessments were performed double blinded. Data were analyzed using SPSS and SyStat SigmaPlot v13 software. Normality was assessed with Shapiro-Wilk test and equal variance was assessed with Brown-Forsythe test. One-way ANOVAs with post-hoc Bonferonni tests were utilized to compare differences with a statistically significant cut-off value of p < 0.05. Two-way ANOVAs for sex and treatment revealed a significant main effect of sex across all body weights and most tissue weights, thus each sex was considered independently. Human Study Population An Early Phase 1 interventional clinical trial (NCT04490239) in a small sample population was performed under the approval and guidance of the University of Mississippi Institutional Review Board (protocol #21–004). Six volunteers (three male, three female) between the ages of 18 and 61 (mean age 31 yr) were included in the non-randomized exploratory study after screening ten participants in Oxford, MS (Table I). The six participants were selected based on subject availability during the preferred study dates; the remaining four were retained as replacement subjects in case of participant withdrawal. Exclusion criteria were allergy to heparin; current use of anti-coagulant or anti-platelet drug therapies or any intranasal medication; known history of anemia, thrombocytopenia or other blood disorder; autoimmune disorders; known history of neurologic/psychiatric disorders; reports of any active infection; or subject is pregnant, breast-feeding or is expecting to conceive during the study. All female volunteers were tested for pregnancy via HCG test during each blood draw; no tests returned positive for pregnancy at any point during the study. All subjects submitted written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study. At baseline, all volunteers had clinically normal aPTT (24–33 s) and INR values (0.8–1.2), along with clinically normal platelet counts (150000–450,000 platelets/μL). All participants completed the entire course of the study. This study was not randomized, as all participants received the intranasal heparin intervention. Administration of Intranasal Heparin to Human Volunteers Administration was carried out in two phases: an acute phase to determine tolerability of two doses, and a chronic phase to determine tolerability of repeated daily doses using U-line nasal spray bottle with pump over a two-week period. During the acute phase, volunteers applied a single spray of 500 U to each nostril on Day 1 in the clinic and volunteers were observed for one hour for adverse events. Whole blood was drawn by venipuncture 24 h after dosing to allow for aPTT measurement. If the aPTT value remained in the clinically normal range, volunteers applied a single spray of 1000 U to each nostril on Day 3 in the clinic. Again, aPTT was measured 24 h post-dosing. No differences in aPTT levels were observed at either dose in the acute phase, thus all participants entered the chronic phase of the intervention. A five-day washout period was used between the acute phase and the chronic phase. During the chronic phase, each volunteer had a single 1000 U heparin spray per nostril administered on Day 1 in the clinic, and the subject was observed for adverse events. Subjects were instructed on how to self-administer the heparin dose, and subjects were given the test article to self-administer daily at home. Volunteers maintained a dosing journal to document self-administration. Follow-up calls were made on Day 4, Day 7, Day 9 and Day 11 to check on subject compliance, response and adverse events. Blood was drawn after the final dose on Day 14 in the clinic for aPTT measurement. Blood was drawn 24 h after the final dose, on Day 15, and two weeks following completion of the study (Day 30) for aPTT, PT/INR and platelet count measurements. All hematological assays were performed by a contract medical testing lab. Results were registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04490239). No changes were made to methods or assessment criteria after trial commencement.",
    "results": "Results and Discussion Chronic Toxicology of Intranasal Heparin in a Mouse Model Varying doses of heparin or vehicle control were administered to the nasal cavities of male and female mice once per day for 14 consecutive days to monitor safety and tolerability with this route of administration. Block randomization was used to assign dosing groups of 5 mg/L (0.06 μg/day), 50 mg/L (0.6 μg/day), 500 mg/L (6 μg/day), and 5000 mg/L (60 μg/day) heparin formulated in 5 mg/mL sodium chloride, 1% benzyl alcohol (pH 5.0–7.5). 12 μL (6 μL/nostril) were administered daily via drop pipetting into the nasal cavity during inspiration. Notes were taken on animal appearance, grooming, signs of distress, and other notable behaviors twice daily throughout the treatment period. Detailed results are shown in Supplementary Table 1. As expected with this developmental stage, both cohorts of male and female mice exhibited small weight gains over the 14-day drug treatment. Two-way multiple comparison ANOVA indicated a main effect of sex on weight, but no treatment effect when all groups were compared. When sex was considered independently, a one-way ANOVA revealed no difference in the extent of weight gain between any of the treatment doses in females (p > 0.05). In males, between group differences were observed and a post-hoc Bonferonni test revealed a statistically significant increase in weight gain in mice treated with 6 μg/day heparin versus vehicle-only control (mean: 1.33 g gain vs 0.33 g gain, p = 0.018). No differences in the weights of mice receiving lower or higher doses were observed (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Sample results from 14 day toxicology trial of intranasal heparin in mice. Images of representative A. vehicle control and B. 60 μg/day mouse nose after two weeks. C. Change in body weight from pre-dose to after the 14th day doseMinor nasal discharge, minor nose wetness, dried nasal residue, and sneezing or nasal bubbling upon administration were observed in both test and vehicle-only groups. Minor irritation (pink discoloration) and minor swelling of the nose was observed in a few animals throughout the 14 day protocol, with no differences in prevalence across groups. Only one mouse (male, 6 μg/day heparin) showed irritation on more than one day of the study and the three days of observed irritation were non-consecutive and ended on day 10. No signs of epistaxis or topical bleeding were evident in any mice during the study (Fig. 1). Overall, the frequency of observed minor effects for heparin-dosed animals were small and consistent between males and females (0.29 ± 0.07 events per day for males, 0.29 ± 0.10 events per day for females). No dose-dependence was observed in the frequency of minor effects for heparin-dosed animals (Fig. 2). The frequency of observed minor effects in vehicle-only control animals in males (0.22 ± 0.10 events per day) or females (0.49 ± 0.14 events per day) was not significantly different from heparin-dosed animals (p > 0.05), suggesting the minor irritation may be attributed to the technical aspects of inspiration-timed intranasal administration in young mice. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Dose dependence of frequency of minor observations reported for 14-day heparin trial in mice. No dose dependence in the frequency of minor observations (nasal discharge, dried nasal residue, mild nasal discoloration, etc.) was observed, and no difference between heparin-dosed and vehicle-only control animals were observedNecropsies were performed at the completion of the drug treatment paradigm with no overt pathology noted across all mice. The wet weights of heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and both kidneys were compared. The only significant difference in wet organ mass observed compared to vehicle-only control was a decrease in liver mass in females receiving the 6 μg/day dose (0.22 g decrease; p = 0.0207). When normalized to total body weight, one-way ANOVA analysis with post-hoc Bonferroni test revealed a small but significant decrease in relative liver:body mass ratio weight in females at 0.6 μg/day (0.0127 g decrease, p = 0.0009), 6 μg/day (0.0131 g decrease, p = 0.0007) and 60 μg/day (0.0112 g decrease, p = 0.0022). Histological assessments of the 6 μg/day and control females revealed no evidence of hepatotoxicity or neoplasia. No significant change was found in liver:body mass ratio for any individual dose in males. All necropsy data are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Whole blood was sampled upon completion of the 14 day dosing regimen and platelet count at this time point revealed no significant difference across all treatment groups (p = 0.766, Fig. 3), indicating no signs of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. In vitro analysis of coagulation time of plasma isolated at this time point also revealed no significant difference in aPTT across all treatment groups (Fig. 4), indicating no clinically significant systemic bioavailability of daily administered intranasal heparin. As expected, inclusion of 1 U/mL and 0.5 U/mL exogenous heparin in the in vitro aPTT test as a positive control resulted in significant differences (p < 0.0001) in aPTT clotting time (Fig. 4), thereby supporting the efficacy of the aPTT assay. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Blood platelet count after 14 days of daily administration of 60 μg of intranasal heparin in mice. No significant difference in platelet count was observed (p = 0.766)Fig. 4. Open in a new tab aPTT assay of mouse plasma after 14-day heparin trial. No significant differences in aPTT clotting time was observed between heparin at any dose versus vehicle only. Significant differences were observed between vehicle only and the vehicle plasma with exogenous heparin added directly at concentrations of 1 U/mL or 0.5 U/mL (p < 0.0001)To assess whether repeated intranasal administration disrupted olfactory function, the buried food test was performed after the final drug administration with the saline and 60 μg/day heparin treatment groups (Fig. 5). Control naïve mice who did not receive any intranasal treatments were also assessed to determine whether physical administration to the nose each day altered the behavioral phenotype. All mice successfully uncovered the food reward, with no significant difference in the latency to complete the task between any group (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.2387). One outlier was observed in the 60 μg/day group with an unusually long time to retrieve the buried food; the subject dug at the location of the food after 43 s, but waited to retrieve it. Overall, no evidence of overt toxicity, intolerability, or systemic bioavailability of intranasal heparin was observed in the mice during the two-week dosing period at any dose, up to 60 μg/day. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Buried food retrieval anosmia assay of naïve, vehicle-only, and 60 μg/day heparin in mice. No significant differences were observed between groups (p = 0.2387) In Vivo Imaging of Instranasal Heparin Clearance Kinetics Of key concern in any therapeutic strategy involving nasal administration of heparin to block viral attachment and entry to nasal epithelial cells is the pharmacokinetics of heparin clearance from the nasal cavity. Unlike residence in the lungs (29), the mucosa of the nasal cavity is constantly cleared into the stomach which can drive intranasal drug clearance. However, heparin has many physical and chemical features that are not common in nasally administered drugs, being much larger and having high negative charge density. To test the lifetime of heparin in the nasal cavity, we labeled heparin at the reducing end with a near-IR chemical dye through an oxime linkage, resulting in a single dye molecule (95 Da) per heparin molecule (avg. ~15,000 Da). After purification, the resulting CF680R-heparin showed no substantial presence of unconjugated dye by analytical size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 6A). The resulting CF680R-heparin has biophysical characteristics almost identical to unmodified heparin, while having quantitative near-IR fluorescence that can be imaged in the living mouse. Due to the intensity of the signal, we administered a dose of 1.67 μg of CF680R-heparin to the mouse and quantified the fluorescence signal in the nasal cavity. A comparison of fits test failed to show a statistically significant improvement in model quality for a two-phase model (p = 0.37), with a one-phase exponential decay model fitting the observed data well (Fig. 6B). The observed half-life of the heparin in the nasal cavity was 39.34 min (95% CI 22.7–66.6 min). At the goal of 12 h protection time post-dose, we retain ~3.2% of the initial heparin dose in the nasal cavity. Based on an average mouse nasal cavity volume of 32 mm3 (30) and an initial dose of 60 μg found to be safe for repeated daily dosing in mice, our model indicates we should retain 60 mg/L heparin in the nasal cavity after 12 h, 10,000 times higher than the heparin IC50 measured for inhibiting pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry (9). Movement of the fluorescence signal is consistent with passage through the nasopharynx and into the digestive tract during mucus clearance (Fig. 6C). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab In vivo imaging of 1.67 μg of nasally administered CF680R-heparin in mice. (A) Analytical size exclusion chromatography verifies that purification has removed nearly all free dye, resulting in all IR fluorescence signal coming from CF680R-heparin. (B) Clearance from the nasal cavity follows a one-phase exponential decay (black line; 95% CI shown as red dotted line) to reach background IR levels (normalized to zero); K = 0.01762, Y0 = 1.070, half life =39.34 min. Signal is normalized to the measured radiant efficiency at 5 min. (C) In vivo imaging shows accumulation and residence in the nasal cavity, with clear evidence of clearance through the gut Tolerability of Intranasal Heparin in Healthy Human Volunteers Heparin was administered to six healthy human volunteers (three male, three female) in two phases. The initial acute phase was performed at two intranasal doses (1000 U/day and 2000 U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily) to monitor for acute adverse effects. No adverse effects were reported during the acute phase, so the chronic phase was performed at 2000 U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily to monitor for longer-term effects after fourteen consecutive days of daily dosing. Effects of intranasal heparin on blood coagulation parameters were followed via an aPTT test 24 h after each dose in the acute phase, as well as immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase (16 day washout period). An INR test was also performed 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, as well as 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase. In all cases, no evidence of systemic bioavailability of heparin was observed based on changes in blood coagulation times compared to the pre-study screening results or the clinically normal range (Fig. 7A and B). Platelet counts were also performed during pre-study screening, immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase. No evidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was observed based on changes in platelet count compared to pre-study values or clinically normal ranges (Fig. 7C). Subjects also reported mild adverse events, summarized in Table I. Two subjects reported mild nasal irritation and/or sneezing after administration, consistent with exposure to the benzyl alcohol found in the heparin formulation. One subject reported spontaneous brief epistaxis during sedentary time on Day 7 of the chronic phase, as well as seven days after the last dose of the chronic phase. Follow-up questioning indicated that this subject had a history of epistaxis that was undisclosed during screening. These early Phase 1 results support that heparin administered intranasally is tolerableat doses up to 2000 U/day for at least 14 days, with no clinically significant systemic distribution of the heparin and no effect on blood coagulation.

The initial acute phase was performed at two intranasal doses (1000 U/day and 2000 U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily) to monitor for acute adverse effects. No adverse effects were reported during the acute phase, so the chronic phase was performed at 2000 U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily to monitor for longer-term effects after fourteen consecutive days of daily dosing. Effects of intranasal heparin on blood coagulation parameters were followed via an aPTT test 24 h after each dose in the acute phase, as well as immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase (16 day washout period). An INR test was also performed 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, as well as 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase. In all cases, no evidence of systemic bioavailability of heparin was observed based on changes in blood coagulation times compared to the pre-study screening results or the clinically normal range (Fig. 7A and B). Platelet counts were also performed during pre-study screening, immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase. No evidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was observed based on changes in platelet count compared to pre-study values or clinically normal ranges (Fig. 7C). Subjects also reported mild adverse events, summarized in Table I. Two subjects reported mild nasal irritation and/or sneezing after administration, consistent with exposure to the benzyl alcohol found in the heparin formulation. One subject reported spontaneous brief epistaxis during sedentary time on Day 7 of the chronic phase, as well as seven days after the last dose of the chronic phase. Follow-up questioning indicated that this subject had a history of epistaxis that was undisclosed during screening. These early Phase 1 results support that heparin administered intranasally is tolerableat doses up to 2000 U/day for at least 14 days, with no clinically significant systemic distribution of the heparin and no effect on blood coagulation.

    "conclusion": "Conclusion Our results demonstrated that UFH produces no local nor systemic adverse effects when administered intranasally to either mice or human volunteers. We observed no signs of nasal inflammation, epistaxis, alterations on platelet count that could lead to potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and significant changes on the aPTT analysis. Our findings revealed no overt signs of toxicity nor disruption of olfactory functions in mice administered UFH intranasally over two weeks at doses up to 60 μg/day. From the findings of in vivo imaging, we observed a two-phase clearance of intranasal UFH from the nasal cavity, with protective concentrations still present 12 h post-dosing, in which approximately 2% of the starting dose remained in the cavity until background levels were again reached after 12 additional hours. No significant changes were observed for aPTT, PT/INR, and platelet counts in human volunteers, indicating that intranasal administration of heparin is tolerable at doses up to at least 2000 U/day for at least 14 days. The lack of both local irritation and systemic bioavailability suggest that intranasal heparin may have a high tolerance with a potentially large therapeutic window for preventing viral infections from respiratory viruses that use heparan sulfate as a co-receptor, including SARS-CoV-2.",

Copyright notice ID: 8890767 PMID: 35237922 Previous version available: This article is based on a previously available preprint posted on medRxiv on February 17, 2022: \"Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Intranasally Administered Heparin\". Abstract Purpose Intranasally administered unfractionated heparin (UFH) and other sulfated polysaccharides are potential prophylactics for COVID-19. The purpose of this research was to measure the safety and pharmacokinetics of clearance of intranasally administered UFH solution from the nasal cavity.Methods Double-blinded daily intranasal dosing in C57Bl6 mice with four doses (60 ng to 60 μg) of UFH was carried out for fourteen consecutive days, with both blood coagulation measurements and subject adverse event monitoring. The pharmacokinetics of fluorescent-labeled UFH clearance from the nasal cavity were measured in mice by in vivo imaging. Intranasal UFH at 2000 U/day solution with nasal spray device was tested for safety in a small number of healthy human subjects.Results UFH showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any dose measured. No significant changes were observed in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, or frequency of minor irritant events over vehicle-only control. Human subjects showed no significant changes in aPTT time, international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count over baseline measurements. No serious adverse events were observed. In vivo imaging in a mouse model showed a single phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity. After 12 h, 3.2% of the administered UFH remained in the nasal cavity, decaying to background levels by 48 h.Conclusions UFH showed no toxic effects for extended daily intranasal dosing in mice as well as humans. The clearance kinetics of intranasal heparin solution from the nasal cavity indicates potentially protective levels for up to 12 h after dosing.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11095-022-03191-4.KEY WORDS: Covid-19, heparin, intranasal delivery, SARS-CoV-2Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to severe social and economic consequences spanning the entire world (1, 2). Despite active vaccination programs and implementation of social distancing parameters, the number of infections and deaths in the world remain significantly high and new highly transmissible strains are emerging (3). SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic betacoronavirus (4) transmitted via person to person mainly through air droplets (5) and sometimes fecal-oral routes (6), potentially infecting nasal, lung, and intestinal tissues (7). Currently, there are no highly effective therapeutics to treat COVID-19, making effective prevention an essential public health goal. SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is initiated by molecular interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (also known as S-protein) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) displayed on the host cell surfaces (8–11). Several viruses from different virus families are known to utilize HSPG as their attachment receptors (12), for example, parainfluenza (13), adenovirus (14–16), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (17, 18), cytomegalovirus (16, 19), and herpes simplex virus (20). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the S-protein-HSPG interaction is followed by binding of S-protein to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (21–26). Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to host HSPG is essential for the progression of virus entry and infection cycle, as evidenced by disruption of virus entry by exogenously administered sulfated polysaccharides, which compete with cell surface HSPGs. The sulfated polysaccharides that have already been investigated as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents include heparin, heparin derivatives and glycosaminoglycan analogs (9, 10, 27). These sulfated polysaccharides are likely to remain effective against emerging variants of concern (VOC) that partially evade vaccine-induced immune response due to differences in polysaccharide and antibody binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (10) and the conserved nature of the polybasic furin cleavage site, one of the major sites of heparin interaction and activity (28). Since the major route of virus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly initiated by airborne droplet infection of nasal tissues, it is reasonable to consider the design of potentially novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, like UFH, for intranasal administration (9, 11). Such an approach may lead to the discovery of novel anticoronaviral agents with high efficacy, fast mechanisms of action, wide therapeutic windows, and non-invasive self-administration protocols for a possible prophylactic use. While heparin administration by injection is already FDA-approved for other uses, potential antiviral utility against coronaviruses is just being explored. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of UFH, particularly regarding the potential consequences of repeated administration to the nasal cavity. Preliminary tests regarding clearance, pharmacokinetics, and safety must be undertaken prior to implementing the actual clinical nasal application of a potentially useful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, like heparin, which is already FDA-approved for use by administration via other routes. In this work, a series of in vivo pharmacological and toxicological aspects of intranasally administered UFH in mice were investigated. Blood histology, coagulation, olfactory behavior, drug clearance, and adverse outcomes were assessed in mice, and safety was evaluated in a small healthy human sample population. Primary objectives for the human study were the measurement of systemic bioavailability based on increased blood coagulation properties using aPTT and INR measurements. Platelet count was also observed to detect any potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Finally, episodes of epistaxis were monitored to measure for localized damage to mucus membranes and/or localized anti-coagulation activity. Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that the intranasal administration of UFH solution will readily deliver the UFH to the nasal passages and will be safe with no or minimal toxic effects in mice or humans. Results indicate efficient delivery, extended retention of heparin in the nasal passages, and clearance of intranasally administered UFH with no major adverse effects.Methods Materials Heparin Sodium Injection, USP was purchased in two different formulations for human intranasal administration: 5000 USP units per mL (NDC: 71288–403-10) and 10,000 USP units per mL (NDC: 00409–2721-30). Heparin sodium salt from porcine intestinal mucosa (≥ 180 U/mg) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used without further purification. CF680R dye was obtained from Biotium (Fremont, CA). Reagents for aPTT analysis were obtained from Pacific Hemostasis. aPTT times were measured on a KC4 coagulometer (Sigma Amelung). Other chemicals were purchased from VWR International (Radnor, PA). The U line S-20037C – 1 Oz Glass Dropper Bottles with pump (100 μl per spray) was provided by Brister’s H & W Compounding Pharmacy, Grenada, MS.Preparation of Heparin Product All formulation steps were performed under a Biosafety cabinet hood in BSL-2 level laboratory. For animal studies, diluent medium was prepared using 39.6 mL of sterile milliQ water, 0.4 mL benzyl alcohol, and 0.36 g of NaCl. The pH of the diluent was adjusted to 6.2, and the diluent solution was filtered using a 0.2 μm filter. A stock solution of 5 mg/mL of heparin was prepared by dissolving 10.5 mg of dry heparin sodium in 2 mL of diluent solution. The stock solution was then serially diluted 10x using the diluent medium to prepare specified doses of heparin. For human studies, heparin sodium injection at either 5000 U/mL (NDC: 71288–402-10) or 10,000 U/mL (NDC: 00406–2721-30) was transferred into glass intranasal U line S-20037C – 1 Oz Glass Dropper spray bottles with a 100 μL actuator (Aptar Pharma, Congers NY) under sterile conditions. The intranasal spray bottles were verified to dispense 0.1 mL of heparin solution per pump.Animals All procedures were approved by the University of Mississippi Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #19–009) or the University of Mississippi Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #1571). Toxicology experiments were performed on wild-type male (19-23 g) and female (16-19 g) C57BL6 mice from Envigo (Indianapolis, IN) in study groups of six mice for each dose (three male, three female). The study was powered to preserve an 80% chance of not committing a Type II error with a 5% chance of Type I error at significant effect sizes (weight as the variable: power > 0.8 to detect a 20% change in body weight within sex (n = 3), 10% change in body weight within entire group (n = 6); aPTT time: power > 0.8 to detect a 100% change in aPTT (n = 4); buried food recovery time: power > 0.8 to detect a 100% change in recovery time (n = 5)). No data were excluded from analysis. In vivo imaging experiments were performed on six (three male, three female) SKH1-Elite mice (Crl:SKH1-Hrhr Outbred: Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). One female mouse exhibited poor response to the anesthetic resulting in significant movement during imaging, so data for this mouse were excluded from the nasal clearance kinetics modeling. All animals for toxicology studies were housed in the AALAC-accredited University of Mississippi Animal Facility and given access to rodent chow (Cat.# 7001, Envigo Teklad 4% Fat Rodent Diet) and tap water ad libitum for the duration of the experiments. Mice were group-housed (3–4 mice/cage) in climate-controlled rooms (30–40% relative humidity, 21–23°C) under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 06:00). All mice were acclimated to the vivarium colony room for five days prior to initiating the drug administration regimen. Upon completion of the study, mice were anesthetized with vaporized isofluorane, perfused with phosphate buffer saline, and secondarily euthanized with decapitation. Tissues of interest were examined, weighed, and fixed in buffered 4% formalin. The left liver lobes were embedded in 30% sucrose (Sigma, S9378) overnight at 4°C and frozen in optimal cutting temperature for cryosectioning (Leica CM 3050S) at −15°C. Serial slices (10 μm) were transferred to superfrost coated glass slides and stained following standard H&E protocols (dehydrated with alcohol, stained in hematoxylin for 2 min, rinsed, differentiated in 70% alcohol and then subsequently stained in 0.01% eosin Y for 30 s, rinsed in 95% ethanol, dehydrated with absolute ethanol and cleared in three xylene washes). Entire hepatic cross-sections were imaged (40x) and stitched (10% overlap) using an HCA Nikon Ti2-E microscope and assessed by a blinded observer.Intranasal (IN) Drug Delivery Mice were transferred to a surgical suite each day and weighed prior to inhaled anesthesia induction with up to 5% isofluorane. Mice were then administered 6 μL per nostril of Heparin solution at concentrations from 5 to 5000 mg/L using a micropipette timed to inspiration. Mice were returned to their home cage and were monitored during recovery (less than 5 min). Drug was administered each morning (08:00–12:00) for 14 consecutive days. Signs of inflammation, bleeding, and/or nasal discharge were monitored twice daily by visual inspection of the nose, body, cage, and bedding. Images of the nose were taken prior to administration, one week into administration, and on the 14th day of administration for further visual analyses of inflammation or irritation.Olfaction Assessment The Buried Food Test was used to assess the ability to smell volatile odors following the 14-day regimen of IN administration. Mice were habituated to the food stimulus of choice, Teddy Grahams (Nabisco, Hanover, New Jersey), at least 24-h prior to behavioral testing to confirm its rewarding stimulus. Mice were food deprived (water ad lib) immediately following Day 14 of IN drug administration to motivate subjects, and tested 24-h later (signs of distress were monitored while food deprived). On test day, the subject was placed in a test chamber containing 3 cm of fresh 1/8 in corncob bedding for a 15-min trial, with the food stimulus buried approximately 1 cm below the bedding surface in a randomly assigned corner of the cage. The subject successfully completed the assay when it uncovered the food stimulus and began to eat, using one or both forepaws on the food. Latency to uncover and eat the food served as the dependent measure. Each trial had a maximum latency of 900 s. Immediately following testing, mice were returned to their home cage, and ad lib access to food was restored.Blood Histology At the time of exsanguination, 20 μL of whole blood was removed and smeared on coverglass for histological assessment. The smears were air dried and stained with Wright’s Blood Stain (Fisher, #9513306), washed 3 times, and dried for microscopic imaging. Only the highest heparin dose was analyzed for platelet count. Five fields per sample were imaged at random at 600x phase contrast using a Nikon Ti2-E Microscope. Platelets in each image were counted by a blinded observer.aPTT Measurements Activated partial thromboplastin time assay (aPTT) was performed by incubating 50 μL of test animal plasma with 50 μL of control reference plasma. Following this, 100 μL of aPTT reagent was added and the individual mixtures were further incubated for five minutes at 37°C. Clotting time was measured in seconds immediately following the addition of 100 μL of 25 mM CaCl2. For control values, heparin was added directly to 100 μL of reference plasma at a defined concentration (U/mL), aPTT reagent was added and the aPTT assay performed as described. In Vivo Imaging of Intranasal Heparin Product CF680R-heparin was generated by conjugating the free reducing-end of heparin with the aminooxy group of the CF680R. Briefly, 50 μM of heparin (EMD Millipore) stock solution was prepared in 100 mM sodium phosphate and 1.5 M sodium chloride (pH 7.4). 5 mM of CF680R (Biotium) stock solution was prepared in water. 150 μL of 5 mM CF680R was added to 300 μL of 50 μM heparin. The molar ratio of heparin and CF680R was 1:50. 45 μL of aniline was added to catalyze the reaction. The mixture was reacted at room temperature overnight in the dark. The conjugate was purified by a 3 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore Sigma) at 13,000×g for 30 min, followed by three washes with 400 μL of water at 13,000×g for 30 min. The final sample was further purified by HPLC size exclusion chromatography using a 4.6 mm × 300 mm ACQUITY BEH SEC column (Waters). Sample was analyzed using an isocratic gradient of 40 mM sodium acetate in 20% methanol at a flow rate of 100 μL/min and detection by UV absorbance at 680 nm. CF680R-heparin (excitation maximum = 680 nm; emission maximum = 701 nm) was resuspended in 1X PBS (600μg/72 μl) and administered at 1 μl per nostril (1.67 μg total) in the mouse anesthetized with 3% isoflurane initially and maintaining anesthesia with 1% isoflurane. Images were acquired on an IVIS Spectrum animal imager system using Living Image® Software (Perkin Elmer). Images were captured before administration of heparin and at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 5 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h post administration. Quantification was performed by manual definition of the nasal cavity followed by software quantification of IR fluorescence average radiant efficiency in the defined area. Background IR intensity was obtained pre-dosing for each animal and subtracted from each time point. Each replicate was normalized to the intensity of nasal IR fluorescence measured five minutes post-dose for each animal. One-phase and two-phase exponential decay modeling was carried out using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 and hypothesis testing using an extra sum-of-squares F test was performed. As the p value for the comparison of fits measurement was not below 0.05 (p = 0.37) and gains in the goodness of fit parameters were minimal for the two-phase decay model (R2 = .77 for the one-phase model versus .78 for the two-phase model), the simpler model was chosen.Statistical Analysis Prior to the initiation of treatment, all mice were thoroughly examined for abnormalities and one mouse with a blunted nose was removed and replaced. Drug was assigned to the mice using block randomization for equal group size and drug doses were coded to ensure administration and outcome assessments were performed double blinded. Data were analyzed using SPSS and SyStat SigmaPlot v13 software. Normality was assessed with Shapiro-Wilk test and equal variance was assessed with Brown-Forsythe test. One-way ANOVAs with post-hoc Bonferonni tests were utilized to compare differences with a statistically significant cut-off value of p < 0.05. Two-way ANOVAs for sex and treatment revealed a significant main effect of sex across all body weights and most tissue weights, thus each sex was considered independently.Human Study Population An Early Phase 1 interventional clinical trial (NCT04490239) in a small sample population was performed under the approval and guidance of the University of Mississippi Institutional Review Board (protocol #21–004). Six volunteers (three male, three female) between the ages of 18 and 61 (mean age 31 yr) were included in the non-randomized exploratory study after screening ten participants in Oxford, MS (Table I). The six participants were selected based on subject availability during the preferred study dates; the remaining four were retained as replacement subjects in case of participant withdrawal. Exclusion criteria were allergy to heparin; current use of anti-coagulant or anti-platelet drug therapies or any intranasal medication; known history of anemia, thrombocytopenia or other blood disorder; autoimmune disorders; known history of neurologic/psychiatric disorders; reports of any active infection; or subject is pregnant, breast-feeding or is expecting to conceive during the study. All female volunteers were tested for pregnancy via HCG test during each blood draw; no tests returned positive for pregnancy at any point during the study. All subjects submitted written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study. At baseline, all volunteers had clinically normal aPTT (24–33 s) and INR values (0.8–1.2), along with clinically normal platelet counts (150000–450,000 platelets/μL). All participants completed the entire course of the study. This study was not randomized, as all participants received the intranasal heparin intervention.Administration of Intranasal Heparin to Human Volunteers Administration was carried out in two phases: an acute phase to determine tolerability of two doses, and a chronic phase to determine tolerability of repeated daily doses using U-line nasal spray bottle with pump over a two-week period. During the acute phase, volunteers applied a single spray of 500 U to each nostril on Day 1 in the clinic and volunteers were observed for one hour for adverse events. Whole blood was drawn by venipuncture 24 h after dosing to allow for aPTT measurement. If the aPTT value remained in the clinically normal range, volunteers applied a single spray of 1000 U to each nostril on Day 3 in the clinic. Again, aPTT was measured 24 h post-dosing. No differences in aPTT levels were observed at either dose in the acute phase, thus all participants entered the chronic phase of the intervention. A five-day washout period was used between the acute phase and the chronic phase. During the chronic phase, each volunteer had a single 1000 U heparin spray per nostril administered on Day 1 in the clinic, and the subject was observed for adverse events. Subjects were instructed on how to self-administer the heparin dose, and subjects were given the test article to self-administer daily at home. Volunteers maintained a dosing journal to document self-administration. Follow-up calls were made on Day 4, Day 7, Day 9 and Day 11 to check on subject compliance, response and adverse events. Blood was drawn after the final dose on Day 14 in the clinic for aPTT measurement. Blood was drawn 24 h after the final dose, on Day 15, and two weeks following completion of the study (Day 30) for aPTT, PT/INR and platelet count measurements. All hematological assays were performed by a contract medical testing lab. Results were registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04490239). No changes were made to methods or assessment criteria after trial commencement.Results and Discussion Chronic Toxicology of Intranasal Heparin in a Mouse Model Varying doses of heparin or vehicle control were administered to the nasal cavities of male and female mice once per day for 14 consecutive days to monitor safety and tolerability with this route of administration. Block randomization was used to assign dosing groups of 5 mg/L (0.06 μg/day), 50 mg/L (0.6 μg/day), 500 mg/L (6 μg/day), and 5000 mg/L (60 μg/day) heparin formulated in 5 mg/mL sodium chloride, 1% benzyl alcohol (pH 5.0–7.5). 12 μL (6 μL/nostril) were administered daily via drop pipetting into the nasal cavity during inspiration. Notes were taken on animal appearance, grooming, signs of distress, and other notable behaviors twice daily throughout the treatment period. Detailed results are shown in Supplementary Table 1. As expected with this developmental stage, both cohorts of male and female mice exhibited small weight gains over the 14-day drug treatment. Two-way multiple comparison ANOVA indicated a main effect of sex on weight, but no treatment effect when all groups were compared. When sex was considered independently, a one-way ANOVA revealed no difference in the extent of weight gain between any of the treatment doses in females (p > 0.05). In males, between group differences were observed and a post-hoc Bonferonni test revealed a statistically significant increase in weight gain in mice treated with 6 μg/day heparin versus vehicle-only control (mean: 1.33 g gain vs 0.33 g gain, p = 0.018). No differences in the weights of mice receiving lower or higher doses were observed (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Sample results from 14 day toxicology trial of intranasal heparin in mice. Images of representative A. vehicle control and B. 60 μg/day mouse nose after two weeks. C. Change in body weight from pre-dose to after the 14th day doseMinor nasal discharge, minor nose wetness, dried nasal residue, and sneezing or nasal bubbling upon administration were observed in both test and vehicle-only groups. Minor irritation (pink discoloration) and minor swelling of the nose was observed in a few animals throughout the 14 day protocol, with no differences in prevalence across groups. Only one mouse (male, 6 μg/day heparin) showed irritation on more than one day of the study and the three days of observed irritation were non-consecutive and ended on day 10. No signs of epistaxis or topical bleeding were evident in any mice during the study (Fig. 1). Overall, the frequency of observed minor effects for heparin-dosed animals were small and consistent between males and females (0.29 ± 0.07 events per day for males, 0.29 ± 0.10 events per day for females). No dose-dependence was observed in the frequency of minor effects for heparin-dosed animals (Fig. 2). The frequency of observed minor effects in vehicle-only control animals in males (0.22 ± 0.10 events per day) or females (0.49 ± 0.14 events per day) was not significantly different from heparin-dosed animals (p > 0.05), suggesting the minor irritation may be attributed to the technical aspects of inspiration-timed intranasal administration in young mice. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Dose dependence of frequency of minor observations reported for 14-day heparin trial in mice. No dose dependence in the frequency of minor observations (nasal discharge, dried nasal residue, mild nasal discoloration, etc.) was observed, and no difference between heparin-dosed and vehicle-only control animals were observedNecropsies were performed at the completion of the drug treatment paradigm with no overt pathology noted across all mice. The wet weights of heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and both kidneys were compared. The only significant difference in wet organ mass observed compared to vehicle-only control was a decrease in liver mass in females receiving the 6 μg/day dose (0.22 g decrease; p = 0.0207). When normalized to total body weight, one-way ANOVA analysis with post-hoc Bonferroni test revealed a small but significant decrease in relative liver:body mass ratio weight in females at 0.6 μg/day (0.0127 g decrease, p = 0.0009), 6 μg/day (0.0131 g decrease, p = 0.0007) and 60 μg/day (0.0112 g decrease, p = 0.0022). Histological assessments of the 6 μg/day and control females revealed no evidence of hepatotoxicity or neoplasia. No significant change was found in liver:body mass ratio for any individual dose in males. All necropsy data are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Whole blood was sampled upon completion of the 14 day dosing regimen and platelet count at this time point revealed no significant difference across all treatment groups (p = 0.766, Fig. 3), indicating no signs of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. In vitro analysis of coagulation time of plasma isolated at this time point also revealed no significant difference in aPTT across all treatment groups (Fig. 4), indicating no clinically significant systemic bioavailability of daily administered intranasal heparin. As expected, inclusion of 1 U/mL and 0.5 U/mL exogenous heparin in the in vitro aPTT test as a positive control resulted in significant differences (p < 0.0001) in aPTT clotting time (Fig. 4), thereby supporting the efficacy of the aPTT assay. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Blood platelet count after 14 days of daily administration of 60 μg of intranasal heparin in mice. No significant difference in platelet count was observed (p = 0.766)Fig. 4. Open in a new tab aPTT assay of mouse plasma after 14-day heparin trial. No significant differences in aPTT clotting time was observed between heparin at any dose versus vehicle only. Significant differences were observed between vehicle only and the vehicle plasma with exogenous heparin added directly at concentrations of 1 U/mL or 0.5 U/mL (p < 0.0001)To assess whether repeated intranasal administration disrupted olfactory function, the buried food test was performed after the final drug administration with the saline and 60 μg/day heparin treatment groups (Fig. 5). Control naïve mice who did not receive any intranasal treatments were also assessed to determine whether physical administration to the nose each day altered the behavioral phenotype. All mice successfully uncovered the food reward, with no significant difference in the latency to complete the task between any group (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.2387). One outlier was observed in the 60 μg/day group with an unusually long time to retrieve the buried food; the subject dug at the location of the food after 43 s, but waited to retrieve it. Overall, no evidence of overt toxicity, intolerability, or systemic bioavailability of intranasal heparin was observed in the mice during the two-week dosing period at any dose, up to 60 μg/day.

No significant differences were observed between groups (p = 0.2387) In Vivo Imaging of Instranasal Heparin Clearance Kinetics Of key concern in any therapeutic strategy involving nasal administration of heparin to block viral attachment and entry to nasal epithelial cells is the pharmacokinetics of heparin clearance from the nasal cavity. Unlike residence in the lungs (29), the mucosa of the nasal cavity is constantly cleared into the stomach which can drive intranasal drug clearance. However, heparin has many physical and chemical features that are not common in nasally administered drugs, being much larger and having high negative charge density. To test the lifetime of heparin in the nasal cavity, we labeled heparin at the reducing end with a near-IR chemical dye through an oxime linkage, resulting in a single dye molecule (95 Da) per heparin molecule (avg. ~15,000 Da). After purification, the resulting CF680R-heparin showed no substantial presence of unconjugated dye by analytical size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 6A). The resulting CF680R-heparin has biophysical characteristics almost identical to unmodified heparin, while having quantitative near-IR fluorescence that can be imaged in the living mouse. Due to the intensity of the signal, we administered a dose of 1.67 μg of CF680R-heparin to the mouse and quantified the fluorescence signal in the nasal cavity. A comparison of fits test failed to show a statistically significant improvement in model quality for a two-phase model (p = 0.37), with a one-phase exponential decay model fitting the observed data well (Fig. 6B). The observed half-life of the heparin in the nasal cavity was 39.34 min (95% CI 22.7–66.6 min). At the goal of 12 h protection time post-dose, we retain ~3.2% of the initial heparin dose in the nasal cavity. Based on an average mouse nasal cavity volume of 32 mm3 (30) and an initial dose of 60 μg found to be safe for repeated daily dosing in mice, our model indicates we should retain 60 mg/L heparin in the nasal cavity after 12 h, 10,000 times higher than the heparin IC50 measured for inhibiting pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry (9). Movement of the fluorescence signal is consistent with passage through the nasopharynx and into the digestive tract during mucus clearance (Fig. 6C). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab In vivo imaging of 1.67 μg of nasally administered CF680R-heparin in mice. (A) Analytical size exclusion chromatography verifies that purification has removed nearly all free dye, resulting in all IR fluorescence signal coming from CF680R-heparin.

(C) In vivo imaging shows accumulation and residence in the nasal cavity, with clear evidence of clearance through the gutTolerability of Intranasal Heparin in Healthy Human Volunteers Heparin was administered to six healthy human volunteers (three male, three female) in two phases. The initial acute phase was performed at two intranasal doses (1000 U/day and 2000 U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily) to monitor for acute adverse effects. No adverse effects were reported during the acute phase, so the chronic phase was performed at 2000 U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily to monitor for longer-term effects after fourteen consecutive days of daily dosing. Effects of intranasal heparin on blood coagulation parameters were followed via an aPTT test 24 h after each dose in the acute phase, as well as immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase (16 day washout period). An INR test was also performed 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, as well as 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase. In all cases, no evidence of systemic bioavailability of heparin was observed based on changes in blood coagulation times compared to the pre-study screening results or the clinically normal range (Fig. 7A and B). Platelet counts were also performed during pre-study screening, immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24 h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16 days after the final dose in the chronic phase. No evidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was observed based on changes in platelet count compared to pre-study values or clinically normal ranges (Fig. 7C). Subjects also reported mild adverse events, summarized in Table I. Two subjects reported mild nasal irritation and/or sneezing after administration, consistent with exposure to the benzyl alcohol found in the heparin formulation. One subject reported spontaneous brief epistaxis during sedentary time on Day 7 of the chronic phase, as well as seven days after the last dose of the chronic phase. Follow-up questioning indicated that this subject had a history of epistaxis that was undisclosed during screening. These early Phase 1 results support that heparin administered intranasally is tolerableat doses up to 2000 U/day for at least 14 days, with no clinically significant systemic distribution of the heparin and no effect on blood coagulation.

These episodes were not disclosed during subject screening. aPTT, INR and platelet counts for this subject were obtained after epistaxis event during post-study follow-up, and all found to be within the clinically normal rangeConclusion Our results demonstrated that UFH produces no local nor systemic adverse effects when administered intranasally to either mice or human volunteers. We observed no signs of nasal inflammation, epistaxis, alterations on platelet count that could lead to potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and significant changes on the aPTT analysis. Our findings revealed no overt signs of toxicity nor disruption of olfactory functions in mice administered UFH intranasally over two weeks at doses up to 60 μg/day. From the findings of in vivo imaging, we observed a two-phase clearance of intranasal UFH from the nasal cavity, with protective concentrations still present 12 h post-dosing, in which approximately 2% of the starting dose remained in the cavity until background levels were again reached after 12 additional hours. No significant changes were observed for aPTT, PT/INR, and platelet counts in human volunteers, indicating that intranasal administration of heparin is tolerable at doses up to at least 2000 U/day for at least 14 days. The lack of both local irritation and systemic bioavailability suggest that intranasal heparin may have a high tolerance with a potentially large therapeutic window for preventing viral infections from respiratory viruses that use heparan sulfate as a co-receptor, including SARS-CoV-2.Supplementary Information ESM 1 (20.6KB, xlsx) (XLSX 20 kb) Acknowledgments and Disclosure This work was supported in part by the University of Mississippi and the  funded Neuropharmacology Core Facility (P30 GM122733).

    "abstract": "Abstract The Coronavirus disease pandemic has steered the global therapeutic research efforts toward the discovery of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) molecules. The role of the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 virus receptors are currently under intense investigation. However, the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has resulted in numerous mutations in the S-protein posing a significant challenge for the design of S-protein-targeted inhibitors. As an example, the 2 key mutations in the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), L452R, and T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) confer tighter binding to the host epithelial cells. Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 via competitive disruption of the S-protein RBD-HSPG interactions and thus have the potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. In this study, 7 different MSGs were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a virus entry assay utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with S-protein of the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) or the Delta (B.1.617.2) strain. Although all tested MSGs showed strong inhibitory activity against both strains, no correlations between MSG structural features and virus inhibition could be drawn. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.

    "introduction": "Introduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been responsible for over 6.3 million deaths globally in a short span of 2 years (World Health Organization [WHO] Covid Dashboard). The causal pathogen of this pandemic is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped betacoronavirus (Hu et al. 2020). This virus expresses a heavily glycosylated spike protein (S-protein) on its envelope (Belouzard et al. 2012). The vaccines have been able to prevent new infections and restrict the severe outcomes of COVID-19; however, the chances of reinfections in vaccinated people cannot be eliminated, especially with the rapid emergence of variants of concerns (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 with increased transmission rates and the likelihood of evading host immune responses. The S-protein expressed on the envelope of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary mode of contact with the host cell heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), thus determining viral tropism, entry, and pathogenesis (Belouzard et al. 2012). The S-protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein which possesses 2 subunits. The S1 subunit, which is capable of interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and the S2 subunit, which helps in membrane fusion, an event necessary for the internalization of the virus particle in the host cell (Belouzard et al. 2012; Tian et al. 2021). Natural evolution of viruses involves multiple genetic mutations. However, only those capable of changing the important protein structure of the virus lead to consequences in terms of virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, and severity of the disease (Callaway 2020). SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) (Wuhan-Hu-1) strain has acquired many crucial mutations over a short period of time, giving rise to various VOCs (Tian et al. 2021). Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first identified in India in October 2020 (WHO database), has so far been the most aggressive variant (Saito et al. 2021). The high pathogenicity of delta variant is linked to the 9 amino acid mutations in its S-protein: T19R, G142D, FR156-157del, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, and D950N (Tian et al. 2021). The L452R, T478K, and P681R are key mutations because they result in significant immune evasion and high transmissibility (Planas et al. 2021; Tian et al. 2021). The L452R mutation is present in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a region of the S-protein involved in binding to the ACE2 receptor. This mutation aids in the stabilization of the S-protein-ACE2 interaction, therefore increasing the molecular binding affinity and viral infectivity (Tian et al. 2021). Substitution of the threonine with lysine in T478K changes the electrostatic surface charge of the viral RBD, strengthening the ACE2 binding (Goher et al. 2021). The mutation P681R has been shown to increase proteolytic cleavage caused by furin between the S1 and S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (Tian et al. 2021), thus increasing the rate of viral fusion and increasing the spread of infection (Saito et al. 2021). The L452R mutation has been shown to significantly contribute to the immune escaping ability of the virus when examined against vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma (Tian et al. 2021). Development of therapeutic strategies capable of inhibiting the infectivity of a broad range of emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in a reasonably consistent manner is critical. As S-protein binding to the host cell surface HSPGs is one of the first and critical steps in the establishment of the infection, abrogation of the same molecular complex would be able to reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 (Clausen et al. 2020). The competitive inhibition of S-protein-HSPG binding by administering sulfated glycans like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or GAG mimetics, e.g. marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) by our group and others, has shown a significant decrease in the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain)(Jin et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020; Mycroft-West et al. 2020; Dwivedi et al. 2021; Song et al. 2021; Tandon et al. 2021; Guimond et al. 2022; Kim et al. 2022). In our previous studies with Wuhan-Hu-1 strain S-protein RBD, significant inhibition was achieved by MSGs (Dwivedi et al. 2021). Therefore, it is logical to start testing the MSGs against emerging VOCs. In the current study, we investigate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of MSGs comparatively against both the SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains to examine if the acquired mutations in the Delta variant would lead to any change in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of the MSGs.",

The structural integrity and reliable purity levels of all these sulfated glycans was confirmed by 1D 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A and B), as they show typical spectral profiles as reported previously (Tandon et al. 2021 for UFH, Farias et al. 2000 for BoSG, Chen et al. 2011 for IbFucCS, Dwivedi et al. 2021 for PpFucCS, Shi et al. 2019 for HfFucCS, Chen et al. 2012 for IbSF, Pomin et al. 2005 for LvSF, and Shi et al. 2019 for HfSF). The purified MSGs were further analyzed by 22% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Fig. 2C and D) to understand polydispersity distribution and to correlate the different molecular weights (MWs) of MSGs with their anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. Their MW distribution was assessed in comparison with mammalian GAGs of known MWs. The series of holothurian FucCS showed bands between ~60 and ~100 kDa (Fig. 2C). The MW distribution of the homopolysaccharides composed of galactose (BoSG) and fucose (IbSF, HfSF, and LvSF) indicates higher MW for these polymers, ≥100 kDa (Fig. 2D). The MWs of the series of FucCS and SF/SG are in accordance with previous publications (Shi et al. 2019; Dwivedi et al. 2021; Zoepfl et al. 2021), confirming therefore the structural integrity. Fig 2.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and Delta strains and cytotoxicity of MSGs MSGs were examined for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into HEK-293T-hACE2 cells using a baculovirus pseudotyped with S-proteins of WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) (Fig. 3A and Table S1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) (Fig. 3B and Table S2) strains and encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). The IC50 values of the MSGs (Table 1) demonstrated generally similar activity of heparin (IC50 = 0.6 mg/L) against the Wuhan strain (range of 0.1–1.0 mg/L) and generally (slightly) weaker activity than heparin (IC50 = 0.2 mg/L) against the Delta strain (range of 0.1–5.9 mg/L). In the cytotoxicity assays (trypan blue exclusion) on HEK-293T-hACE2 cells, all tested MSGs, except HfSF, exhibited no significant cell death even at the highest concentration of 50 mg/L and 60 h of continuous exposure as compared to the mock-treated cells (Fig. 3B and Table S3).

Copyright notice ID: 9487896 PMID: 35788318 Abstract The Coronavirus disease pandemic has steered the global therapeutic research efforts toward the discovery of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) molecules. The role of the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 virus receptors are currently under intense investigation. However, the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has resulted in numerous mutations in the S-protein posing a significant challenge for the design of S-protein-targeted inhibitors. As an example, the 2 key mutations in the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), L452R, and T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) confer tighter binding to the host epithelial cells. Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 via competitive disruption of the S-protein RBD-HSPG interactions and thus have the potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. In this study, 7 different MSGs were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a virus entry assay utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with S-protein of the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) or the Delta (B.1.617.2) strain. Although all tested MSGs showed strong inhibitory activity against both strains, no correlations between MSG structural features and virus inhibition could be drawn. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains. Keywords: fucosylated chondroitin sulfate, nuclear magnetic resonance, SARS-CoV-2, sulfated fucan, viral inhibitionIntroduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been responsible for over 6.3 million deaths globally in a short span of 2 years (World Health Organization [WHO] Covid Dashboard). The causal pathogen of this pandemic is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped betacoronavirus (Hu et al. 2020). This virus expresses a heavily glycosylated spike protein (S-protein) on its envelope (Belouzard et al. 2012). The vaccines have been able to prevent new infections and restrict the severe outcomes of COVID-19; however, the chances of reinfections in vaccinated people cannot be eliminated, especially with the rapid emergence of variants of concerns (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 with increased transmission rates and the likelihood of evading host immune responses. The S-protein expressed on the envelope of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary mode of contact with the host cell heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), thus determining viral tropism, entry, and pathogenesis (Belouzard et al. 2012). The S-protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein which possesses 2 subunits. The S1 subunit, which is capable of interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and the S2 subunit, which helps in membrane fusion, an event necessary for the internalization of the virus particle in the host cell (Belouzard et al. 2012; Tian et al. 2021). Natural evolution of viruses involves multiple genetic mutations. However, only those capable of changing the important protein structure of the virus lead to consequences in terms of virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, and severity of the disease (Callaway 2020). SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) (Wuhan-Hu-1) strain has acquired many crucial mutations over a short period of time, giving rise to various VOCs (Tian et al. 2021). Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first identified in India in October 2020 (WHO database), has so far been the most aggressive variant (Saito et al. 2021). The high pathogenicity of delta variant is linked to the 9 amino acid mutations in its S-protein: T19R, G142D, FR156-157del, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, and D950N (Tian et al. 2021). The L452R, T478K, and P681R are key mutations because they result in significant immune evasion and high transmissibility (Planas et al. 2021; Tian et al. 2021). The L452R mutation is present in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a region of the S-protein involved in binding to the ACE2 receptor. This mutation aids in the stabilization of the S-protein-ACE2 interaction, therefore increasing the molecular binding affinity and viral infectivity (Tian et al. 2021). Substitution of the threonine with lysine in T478K changes the electrostatic surface charge of the viral RBD, strengthening the ACE2 binding (Goher et al. 2021). The mutation P681R has been shown to increase proteolytic cleavage caused by furin between the S1 and S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (Tian et al. 2021), thus increasing the rate of viral fusion and increasing the spread of infection (Saito et al. 2021). The L452R mutation has been shown to significantly contribute to the immune escaping ability of the virus when examined against vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma (Tian et al. 2021). Development of therapeutic strategies capable of inhibiting the infectivity of a broad range of emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in a reasonably consistent manner is critical. As S-protein binding to the host cell surface HSPGs is one of the first and critical steps in the establishment of the infection, abrogation of the same molecular complex would be able to reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 (Clausen et al. 2020). The competitive inhibition of S-protein-HSPG binding by administering sulfated glycans like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or GAG mimetics, e.g. marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) by our group and others, has shown a significant decrease in the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain)(Jin et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020; Mycroft-West et al. 2020; Dwivedi et al. 2021; Song et al. 2021; Tandon et al. 2021; Guimond et al. 2022; Kim et al. 2022). In our previous studies with Wuhan-Hu-1 strain S-protein RBD, significant inhibition was achieved by MSGs (Dwivedi et al. 2021). Therefore, it is logical to start testing the MSGs against emerging VOCs. In the current study, we investigate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of MSGs comparatively against both the SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains to examine if the acquired mutations in the Delta variant would lead to any change in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of the MSGs.Results and discussion Structural features of MSGs Figure 1 displays all sulfated glycans screened in inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains.

Concluding remarks In this study, 7 MSGs were examined, comparatively to heparin, regarding their capacities to block 2 strains, WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2), of SARS-CoV-2. Although each sulfated glycan showed its own inhibitory capacity, the inhibitory activities of the MSGs strains were generally similar and (slightly) weaker, respectively, against Wuhan and Delta strains. No correlation between structural features (sulfation pattern, MW, monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkage, and/or anomeric configuration) and anticoronaviral activity was observed. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.Materials and methods Materials Sea cucumbers, I. badionotus, P. pygmaea and H. floridana, were obtained from the Gulf Specimen Lab (Gulf of Mexico, Florida Keys). Papain, Sephadex G15 medium, and DEAE Sephacel resin were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, United States). LMWH, UFH (180 IU/mg), and CS-C were purchased from Sigma. Baculovirus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 WT and Delta variant S-protein containing a GFP reporter was obtained from Montana Molecular (Bozeman, MT, United States). HEK-293T-hACE2 cells were obtained from BEI resources. Deuterium oxide (D2O) (D 99.90%) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA, United States). NMR tubes (3 mm) were purchased from VWR International (Radnor, PA, United States).Extraction of MSGs The sulfated glycans—IbSF, IbFucCS, PpFucCS, HfFucCS, and HfSF were extracted from the body wall of sea cucumbers—I. badionotus, P. pygmaea, and H. floridana following the proteolytic digestion procedure reported earlier (Chen et al. 2011, 2012; Dwivedi et al. 2021). The 100 mg of dried body wall was digested using 0.1 mg of papain (0.5–2 U/mg) at 60 °C (24 h) in 2 mL of digestion buffer (5 mM of cysteine, 5 mM of EDTA in 0.1 M of sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0). The digested mixture was centrifuged (4,000 rpm for 30 min) and the supernatant was precipitated using 2 volumes of 95% ethanol. The precipitate was kept at −20 °C for 24 h before centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 30 min. Precipitate was dissolved in water, dialyzed 3 times against distilled water, and lyophilized. BoSG and LvSF were isolated from the body wall of the red alga B. occidentalis and the egg jelly of the female gametes of L. variegatus, as reported earlier (Pomin et al. 2021).Purification of MSGs The crude extract (50 mg) was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography (packed with DEAE Sepahcel resin) column (2.5 × 20 cm). A linear gradient of NaCl (in 0.1 M NaOAc, pH 6.0) from 0 to 3 M was applied at a flow rate of 18 mL/h. The eluted fractions were assayed for the presence of sulfated glycans by 1,9–dimethylmethylene blue reagent. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed 3 times against water and were lyophilized. Sugars were further purified on a size exclusion column Sephadex G15 (1 × 30 cm).NMR analysis The 1D 1H NMR spectra of UFH and MSGs (IbSF, IbFucCS, PpFucCS, HfFucCS, and HfSF) were acquired at 25 °C on 400-MHz Bruker Avance III HD using a 5-mm BBFO RT probe. The NMR sample was prepared in a 3-mm NMR tube by dissolving 3–5 mg of pure polysaccharide in 200 μL D2O (99.90%). The 64 NMR scans were acquired for each sample involving a relaxation delay of 1 sec with a total acquisition time of 1 min 41 s. The acquired proton NMR data was processed and analyzed using MestreNova 14.1.0 and TopSpin 4.0 software.MW estimation of MSGs The MW distribution of the purified MSGs was determined on a 1.5-mm thick discontinuous PAGE system having 4% stacking gel and a 22% resolving gel phase. The 10 μg of samples dissolved in loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.5 M Tris, pH 6.8) were loaded into the wells of the stacking gel. LMWH (~8 kDa), UFH (~15 kDa), and CS-C (~60 kDa) were run alongside the MSGs as MW markers. Electrophoretic migration was carried out at 100 V in 0.25 M of Tris-Glycine running buffer. The migration of bands was tracked by 0.02% bromocresol green dye. Gel was stained using 0.1% (w/v) toluidine blue (in 1% acetic acid) for 1 h and was destained using 1% acetic acid (Vasconcelos et al. 2018; Dwivedi et al. 2021).Viral inhibition of MSGs The virus inhibitor screening was done on human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T) expressing human ACE2 (HEK-293T-hACE2 cell line, BEI Resources #NR-52511) plated in a 96-well tissue culture plate using baculovirus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 and Delta S-proteins (#C1110G and #C1123G, respectively) containing a green fluorescent reporter (Montana Molecular, #C1123G) (Dwivedi et al. 2021; Tandon et al. 2021; Yan et al. 2021). Virus titers were confirmed by enumerating GFP-positive transduced cells in a dilution series under a fluorescence microscope (EVOS-FL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and by multiplying by the dilution factor with the volume plated. Serial dilutions (50, 5, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, and 0.0005 mg/L) of the test MSGs were made in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in triplicates to the final volume of 100 μL in each well. The controls used were UFH at 50 mg/L and mock-treated cells. The 2.5 μL of the pseudotype virus stock (2 × 1010 units per mL) was mixed with the test compounds and was incubated for 1 h, which was then laid over HEK-293T-hACE2 cells plated in a 96-well plate along with 2 mM of sodium butyrate. Plate was then incubated for 60 h and the assay was read on a Cytation 5 automated fluorescence microscope after fixing with 3.7% formaldehyde. The relative IC50 values were calculated in Prism 9 (Graphpad Inc.) by plotting normalized values from the assay against the concentrations (log) of MSGs and controls and analyzing by nonlinear regression to fit a dose–response curve using the least-squares method considering each replicate value as an individual point.Cytotoxicity of MSGs Cytotoxic potential of MSGs was examined against HEK-293T-hACE2 cells seeded in 12-welled tissue culture plates following the protocol reported earlier (Dwivedi et al. 2021; Tandon et al. 2021). Briefly, the confluent HEK-293T-hACE2 cells were treated with MSGs at a final concentration of 50 mg/L along with 2 mM of sodium butyrate. The cell viability was estimated via trypan blue exclusion assay upon harvesting the treated cells after 60 h of incubation. Assay readout was measured on a TC20 automated cell counter (BioRad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Funding This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (grant numbers 1P20GM130460-01A1-7936 and 1R03NS110996-01A1) and the University of Mississippi to V.H.P.

    "title": "Inhibition of Cytomegalovirus by Pentacta pygmaea Fucosylated Chondroitin Sulfate Depends on Its Molecular Weight",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10142442/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Many viruses attach to host cells by first interacting with cell surface proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains and then by engaging with specific receptor, resulting in virus entry. In this project, HS–virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) fractions and the virus yield at five days post-infection was assessed. The virus attachment and entry into the cells were visualized by labeling the purified virus particles with a self-quenching fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine B (R18). The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV specifically blocking virus entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. PpFucCS and the derived oligosaccharides did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity; moreover, they protected the infected cells from virus-induced lytic cell death. In conclusion, PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells and the high MW of this carbohydrate is a key structural element to achieve the maximal anti-viral effect. This new marine sulfated glycan can be developed into a potential prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infection. Keywords: herpesviruses, marine sulfated glycans, virus entry",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Betaherpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), are common human pathogens, yet only a small percentage of infected people experience acute illness [1]. In people with impaired immune systems, HCMV-mediated infections can be life-threatening. Despite significant advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic management of the disease, HCMV poses a serious threat in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients as well as in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients [2]. In addition, HCMV infection in utero is the leading cause of congenital infection that can result in developmental abnormalities, including sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delays, and even fetal death [3,4,5]. There are currently no commercially available vaccines to prevent HCMV infection [6] and only a small number of drugs, including ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, maribavir, and letermovir, have been Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment/prophylaxis of HCMV infection and disease [7,8]. Moreover, drug resistance is increasingly common with circulating strains acquiring UL54 (polymerase) and/or UL97 (kinase) mutations that confer resistance to commonly available drugs [9,10,11]. Therefore, the identification of newer anti-HCMV drugs with improved efficacy and novel modes of action are essentially needed. Heparan sulfate (HS) is present on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix of most mammalian tissues [12,13]. Numerous viruses including HCMV attach to host cells by first engaging with cell surface HS glycosaminoglycan chains, followed by interaction with the specific protein receptors, which results in virus entry [14,15]. HCMV can infect different types of cells and tissues indicating that it can engage with a wide variety of host cell receptors to enter the cell and establish an infection [16,17,18,19]. Specific viral glycoproteins engage these structurally and functionally distinct receptors that include the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, cellular integrins, neuropilin-2, and epidermal growth factor receptor [20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. Earlier, our group showed that HCMV preferentially binds to uniquely sulfated and polymerized HS using its surface glycoprotein B (gB) [15]. HS mimetics, including heparin, bind to gB and inhibit HCMV infection by competitively inhibiting virus attachment to the cell surface [15,27]. Heparin is composed of disaccharide-repeating units (Figure 1A) and is an efficient anticoagulant; it can cause excessive bleeding and thrombocytopenia that necessitate close patient observation and, if necessary, the administration of an antidote (protamine) [28,29]. Two potential solutions to these anticoagulant side effects are using either the naturally potent anti-viral sulfated glycans with lower anticoagulant properties or the dissociation of the anticoagulant and anti-viral properties of the existing heparin. We were able to provide instances of both in our earlier work [28,30,31]. In contrast to heparin, a newly discovered fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (FucCS) from the body wall of the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) was found to have significantly lower anticoagulant activity but significant antiviral efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [28]. The PpFucCS anticoagulant activity can be further reduced by hydrolysis into oligosaccharide fractions [30]. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Structural representation of sulfated glycans assayed for anti-HCMV activity. (A) Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is mostly composed of repeating disaccharide units of [→4)-α-GlcN-(1→4)-α-IdoA-(1→] where GlcN is glucosamine and IdoA is iduronic acid. Sulfation occurs frequently at the N- and C6-positions of GlcN and C2 position of IdoA. (B) PpFucCS is constituted of a chondroitin sulfate backbone that alternates N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) in repeating disaccharide units of [→3)-β-GalNAc-(1→4)-β-GlcA-(1→], where the GalNAc units are primarily 4-sulfated (80%) and, to a very less degree, 4,6-disulfated (10%) or nonsulfated (10%). The GlcA units are replaced at the C3 position by three different forms of α-fucose (Fuc) branches: Fuc2,4S-(1→(40%), Fuc2,4S-(1→4)-Fuc-(1→(30%), and Fuc4S-(1→(30%); where S = SO3−. In the current investigation, PpFucCS (Figure 1B) was used to target HS–virus interaction and prevent HCMV entry into cells. We show that PpFucCS has significant antiviral activity against HCMV and that, when hydrolyzed into fractions, the oligosaccharides lose their anti-HCMV activity in a size-dependent manner.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods PpFucCS extraction and purification: As previously reported [30], PpFucCS was recovered from the body wall of the sea cucumber P. pygmaea (Gulf Specimen Lab Gulf of Mexico, Florida Keys) by performing proteolytic digestion using papain (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Using anion exchange chromatography, the dry crude extract was fractionated on a 1.5 cm × 20 cm column packed with DEAE-Sephacel resin (Sigma). It was then eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl in 0.1 M NaOAc at pH 6.0 from 0 M to 3 M with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. 1,9-dimethyl methylene blue (DMB) reagent was used to monitor each fraction. The polysaccharide fractions that were detected using the DMB assay were combined, dialyzed three times against water, and then lyophilized to concentrate for preservation and transportation. The dialyzed sugars were then subjected to purification using a Sephadex G15 (Sigma) column (1 cm × 30 cm) with water as the mobile phase for cleanup. The lyophilization was performed to purify the sugar. To estimate the concentration of the samples in the various assays, dry weight measurements were collected. PpFucCS Depolymerization: PpFucCS was depolymerized using a modified Fenton technique that has been demonstrated to be extremely selective for the breakage of GlcA and GalNAc bonds found in the backbone of this class of polysaccharides [30]. A previously described methodology that had been slightly changed was used to carry out the reaction; 40 mg of dry-weight PpFucCS was weighed and dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in 0.1 M sodium acetate at a pH of 6.0 to optimize the reaction conditions; 0.02 mM copper (II) acetate (final concentration) was then added to the dissolved polysaccharide solution. The reaction was carried out for 180 min at 60 °C with constant stirring after the addition of 200 mM H2O2 in drops to the reaction liquid. By removing the copper ions from the reaction mixture using Chelex (50–100 mesh size) resin, the reaction was quenched by adding Chelex resin that had been pre-equilibrated using 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, and keeping it on an end-to-end rotor for 2 h at room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min after 2 h. The supernatant was lyophilized and desalted. Fractionation of PpFucCS oligosaccharides: The dried depolymerized mixture of PpFucCS was fractionated depending on the size in a Bio-Gel P-10 column (1.5 cm × 170 cm), at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/15 min. A 10% ethanol solution containing 1.0 M NaCl was used to fractionate the mixture. Hydrolyzed PpFucCS (HdPpFucCS) is native PpFucCS that has been subjected to depolymerization The fractions obtained were assayed for the presence of PpFucCS oligosaccharides using DMB. The eluted oligosaccharides were divided into 4 fractions (Fr1–Fr4) based on the DMB profile and their corresponding retention times on the Bio-Gel P-10 column. Before any analysis, all the fractions were desalted on the Sephadex G-15 column and then lyophilized. See [30]. Distribution of PpFucCS oligosaccharides: Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was used to analyze the oligosaccharide distribution of the depolymerized PpFucCS fractions [30]. PpFucCS oligosaccharides structural integrity determination: The structural integrity of the PpFucCS oligosaccharides produced was investigated using one-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1D 1H NMR) spectroscopy [30]. Cells: The human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Corning, Manassas, VA, USA, catalog No. 10-013-CM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA, catalog No. 10437-028), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Corning, Manassas, VA, USA; catalog No. 30-002-CI) at 37 °C along with 5% CO2 [32]. Virus: HCMV (TowneBAC strain) tagged with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) [33] was grown on the HFF cells. The virus stock was prepared in 3X autoclaved milk, sonicated three times for 10 s with a 30 s gap, and stored at −80 °C. For the preparation of the autoclaved milk, we dissolved Nestle Carnation instant nonfat dry milk powder in nanopure water at neutral pH to obtain 10% milk [6,15,34], which was then autoclaved three consecutive times before storage at 4 °C. Virus infections: For infecting the HFFs, the media was removed from the wells of the cell culture plates, washed with serum-free medium DMEM, and appropriately diluted virus stock was absorbed on the cells in DMEM without serum. The cells were incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking every 10 min followed by washing thrice with serum-free DMEM. Fresh complete DMEM was added, and the cells were incubated until the endpoint. IC50 assay and percent inhibition calculation: To determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of PpFucCS, its hydrolyzed form, and its fractions, the HFFs were pretreated for 1 h with a range of concentrations (50 μg/mL, 25 μg/mL, 12.5 μg/mL, 6.25 μg/mL, 3.12 μg/mL, 1.56 μg/mL, and 0.78 μg/mL), UFH, or mock, and then infected with HCMV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The cells were fixed at 5 days post-infection (dpi), and the number of GFP-positive cells for each concentration was enumerated using the Cytation 5 automated microscope (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The experiment was repeated three times in order to confirm the reproducibility of the measurements. The data were normalized in GraphPad Prism 9.0, using the number of GFP-positive cells in the mock wells as 0% inhibition and the number ‘0′ as 100% inhibition. The percentage (%) inhibition was plotted against the concentration range. The relative IC50s were calculated using a fixed top limit of the average vehicle-only control and a floating bottom limit. For virus yield reduction assays, the HFFs were pretreated for 1 h with a range of concentrations (50 μg/mL, 25 μg/mL, 12.5 μg/mL, 6.25 μg/mL, 3.12 μg/mL, 1.56 μg/mL, and 0.78 μg/mL), of PpFucCS and mock (in duplicates of two independent experiments), and then infected with HCMV at a MOI of 3. The samples were harvested within the medium at 5 dpi by scraping the cells and stored at −80 °C before titration. On the day of titration, the harvested samples were sonicated three times for 10 s each with a 30 s gap. The monolayers of the HFFs were grown in 12-well tissue culture plates, and serial dilutions of the sonicated samples in the DMEM (without any additional compounds) were absorbed onto them for 1 h (in duplicates), followed by washing thrice with serum-free DMEM. For the viral titers, fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and gamma immunoglobulin was added to the HFFs. At this step, no native PpFucCS was added to the overlayed medium, and the cells were incubated for from 9 to 10 dpi. At the endpoint, the DMEM overlay was removed, and the cells were washed 2X using PBS. The infected HFFs were then fixed in 100% methanol for 5 min. The HFFs were immediately stained using Modified Giemsa stain (Sigma-Aldrich, Milli-pore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA, catalog No. GS1L) for 15 minutes. the plates were then washed with tap water and air dried, and the dark stained plaques were quantified. Octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) labeling and entry assay: The appropriate amount of virus was incubated using R18 (20 ng/L) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA, catalog No. O246) at 4 °C for 1 h. An equal volume of DMEM was added and the tube was centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C to pellet the labeled virus, which was resuspended in 200 μL of DMEM. The native PpFucCS (50 μg/mL) was overlayed on the cells (HFF) for 1 h at 37 °C, and the plate was then incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. The purified virus, labeled with R18, was added to the plate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the pre-treated cells to allow for virus attachment. Thereafter, the unbound virus was washed off using PBS and the plate was moved to 37 °C to allow for virus entry. The plates were fixed for staining with Hoechst dye at different time points after the 37 °C move. The mock-treated cells with the labeled and unlabeled virus were used as controls. Microscopy: The samples were prepared using the established protocols for fluorescence microscopy. Briefly, the HFF cells were grown on coverslip inserts in 24-well tissue culture plates. The cells were pretreated using PpFucCS at 50 μg/mL concentration for 1 h and cooled at 4 °C for 15 min before infection using R18-labeled HCMV at a MOI of 3.0. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C along with 5% CO2 for 1 h. At the different time points (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min) after the shift to 37 °C, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and incubated in 50 mM NH4Cl in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min to reduce autofluorescence and washed using 2X PBS. Finally, the cells were incubated in Hoechst solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Catalog No. 33342) in PBS (1:3000) for 10 min to stain the nucleus, followed by a PBS wash. The coverslips were retrieved from the wells and were mounted on glass slides with a drop of mounting medium (2.5% DABCO in Fluoromont G) and air dried for two hours before imaging. The images were acquired on an EVOS-FL epifluorescent microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell viability: The HFFs were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates and grown to confluency (in triplicates). The cells were pretreated for 1 h with the highest concentration of test compounds and controls and then infected with HCMV at a MOI of 3.0 or mock infected. The medium was removed at 5 dpi, and the HFFs were harvested using trypsinization. The cell viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion using a TC20 automated cell counter (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The test was also performed using the native PpFucCS at 500 µg/mL via the trypan blue exclusion assay along with the ATP release assay. We performed the bioluminescent ATP assay by overlaying the compounds for five days on the confluent HFF in an opaque-walled 96-well tissue culture plate with blank controls using a CellTiter-Glo 2.0 Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA, Catalog No. G9242) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The ATP luminescence was measured using a Cytation 7 automated microscope (BioTek Instruments, Inc.) with the Endpoint/Kinetic read type using a single wavelength with the appropriate gain. The viability experiments were repeated two times to confirm the measurements. Statistics: The data were plotted in Graphpad Prism (Version 9.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA, www.graphpad.com, accessed on 3 March 2023). The standard error of the mean was plotted as error bars. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. An asterisk (*) denotes a significant inhibition compared to the mock. The data were evaluated using one-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism 9.0 for multiple comparisons, and the differences between the groups were considered significant at a p-value of less than 0.05.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Inhibition of HCMV by PpFucCS and Its Fractions Here, we investigated the inhibitory activity of both native PpFucCS and its LMW fractions against HCMV. The LMW PpFucCS oligosaccharides studied here were used to establish a structural activity relationship and the influence of MW distribution on its anti-viral activity against HCMV. The native PpFucCS exhibited potent and efficacious inhibitory activity against HCMV while the PpFucCS fractions showed decreased activity in both potency and efficacy (Figure 2A). Comparing the mean inhibition at the highest concentration used (50 μg/mL), we show that the efficacy of native PpFucCS along with the unfractionated but hydrolyzed PpFucCS oligosaccharide mixture (HdPpFucCS) and Fr1 was comparable to UFH, but it was significantly lower in the case of Fr2, Fr3, and Fr4 (Figure 2B). Additionally, the native PpFucCS had the least half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value amongst all the tests and was comparable to that of UFH (Table 1). Thus, based on the comparison of low MW PpFucCS products, it is evident that HdPpFucCS and Fr1 maintain better antiviral activity than Fr2, Fr3, and Fr4 while displaying only slightly less activity than native PpFucCS and UFH. Earlier, our 1D 1H NMR spectra showed the presence of four fucose units in Fr1–Fr3 that were similar to the native PpFucCS structure: α- Fuc2,4S, α-Fuc2,4S, α-Fuc4S, and α-Fuc0S [30]. This indicates that, although Fr1–Fr3 differ in size, they have similar structures. The Fuc anomeric peaks in fraction 4 showed an upfield 1H shift, which may indicate desulfation. Interestingly, the Fenton chemistry demonstrated a preserved structural integrity of the native PpFucCS in the majority of the oligosaccharides produced (Fr1–Fr3), and only a small percentage of the very low MW (Fr4) showed more chemical modifications [30]. Combining these recently published results with the current results, it is evident that PpFucCS oligosaccharides lose their anti-HCMV activity in a size-dependent manner and that structural features play a crucial role in their anti-viral activity. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Anti-HCMV activity of PpFucCS oligosaccharides. PpFucCS oligosaccharides were assayed for their potential to inhibit the HCMV (GFP-tagged TowneBAC strain) infection in HFFs (MOI 0.1) by enumerating the cells expressing GFP. (A) Normalized values from the assay were analyzed by nonlinear regression to fit a dose–response curve using the least squares method considering each repeated measure as an individual point. The plotted curve shows the percentage of HCMV inhibition in a (log) concentration-dependent manner. Curves in the plot represent the following: PpFucCS (red), HdPpFucCS (green), Fr1 (navy), Fr2 (purple), Fr3 (blue), Fr4 (brown), and UFH (black). (B) Using the normalized values from the same assay, we calculated the percentage inhibition at the maximum concentration used (Imax) and compared with the UFH at the same concentration (50 µg/mL) by performing one-way ANOVA test with multiple comparisons by comparing the means of each test with control UFH, and corrected using a Dunnett’s post hoc test, showing significant differences among the means. The results are representative of three independent experiments. The standard error of the mean was plotted as error bars. The ***, **, and ns (non-significant) indicate p-value < 0.001, from 0.001 to 0.01, and ≥0.05, respectively.Table 1. IC50 values of anti-viral activities of PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides. The IC50 values of anti-HCMV inhibitory activity of PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides were determined in HFFs. Considering the role of avidity often found in protein–glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions and the broad range of molecular weights of the compounds, IC50 values were measured in terms of µg/mL rather than the molar units.

PpFucCS Specifically Inhibits HCMV Entry into Cells To assess whether PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells (HFFs), we utilized the TowneBAC strain of the HCMV labeled with a self-quenching fluorescent label (R18 fluorescence assay). The fluorescence was recorded at different time intervals starting from 0 to 60 min post infection (Figure 3). The R18 dye transitions from one monolayer of a fluid-state phospholipid bilayer membrane to another in a potential-dependent manner, somewhat relieving the quenching of its fluorescence [35]. The fluorescence from the HCMV virus particles that have been labeled with high quantities of R18 is highly self-quenched and their fusion with the host cell membrane leads to an increase in fluorescence, which is often visible only after the virus has entered the cell. A significantly higher number of virus particles entered the mock-treated cells compared to the cells treated with native PpFucCS at 60 min post infection (Figure 3A,B). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Inhibition of HCMV entry into the HFF cells by native PpFucCS. The primary HFF were challenged by the unlabeled (a) or R18 labeled (b–i) TowneBAC strain of HCMV at a MOI of 3.0. The HFFs were either mock treated (a–c) or pretreated for one hour using PpFucCS (50 μg/mL) (d–i). The number of fluorescent virus particles were enumerated at different time points post infection and plotted in Graphpad Prism 9. The HFFs were either mock treated and infected with the unlabeled virus at ‘60′ min (a), or mock treated and infected with the R18 labeled virus at ‘0′ min (b), ‘60′ min (c), or PpFucCS-treated and infected with the R18 labeled virus at ‘0′ min (d), ‘5′ min (e), ‘10′ min (f), ‘20′ min (g), ‘40′ min (h), and ‘60′ min (i). (A) Images showing the different groups either treated or mock treated. The cell nuclei appear blue fluorescent while the red fluorescent virus particles are indicated by the circle and arrows. (B) Bar plot represents the number of fluorescent virus particles per image field for treatment groups at different time points. The results are representative of four independent experiments and were analyzed by performing one-way ANOVA test with multiple comparisons (comparing the means of each test with mock-treated control at ‘60′ min). The standard error of the mean was plotted as error bars. The ***, and ns indicate p-value < 0.001, and ≥0.05, respectively. 3.3. Effect of PpFucCS and Its Oligosaccharides Treatment on Cell Viability PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides do not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity against primary HFF cells when examined at the highest concentration used in the antiviral assay (50 μg/mL) (Figure 4A) and show a protective effect against virus-induced cell death at five days post infection (Figure 4B) when examined using a trypan blue exclusion assay. Notably, the Fr3 and Fr4 that did not show any significant antiviral activity (Figure 2) also did not show any significant protection from virus-induced cell death. Furthermore, we did not see any cytotoxic effect on the HFFs when treated with the native PpFucCS at 500 μg/mL for five days using the trypan blue exclusion assay (Figure S2). To corroborate these findings, we treated the HFFs with the native PpFucCS at 500 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL along with heparin control for five days and performed the ATP release assay (Figure S3). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Effect of treatment of PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides on cell viability of HFF cells. The primary HFF were pretreated for one hour using PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides at the highest concentration used for inhibition assays (50 μg/mL) along with heparin (UFH) control. The HFFs were either mock infected (A) or infected with HCMV at a MOI of 3.0 (B) in the presence of test compounds. Cells were harvested at 5 days post-infection and cell viability was assessed using a trypan blue exclusion assay. The results are representative of two independent experiments. The standard error of the mean was plotted as error bars. The **, *, and ns indicate p-value between 0.001 and 0.01, between 0.01 and 0.05, and ≥0.05, respectively.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion In this study, we demonstrated that PpFucCS and its hydrolyzed fractions efficiently inhibit the HCMV infection of primary human fibroblasts, specifically blocking virus entry into the cells. The treatment of HFFs with native PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides did not affect the cell viability for the duration of treatment, thus confirming that the observed reduction in the virus titer was not because of cytotoxicity. Moreover, when the HFFs were pretreated and maintained in these marine glycans throughout the course of infection, the cells resisted infection-induced cell death. To confirm that PpFucCS has a direct impact on virus entry, we used HCMV labeled with self-quenching dye that only fluoresces when the virus fuses with the cell membrane. This experiment showed the significant effect of PpFucCS on HCMV entry. GAGs are composed of repeating disaccharide units that contain an amino sugar (either GalNAc or GlcNAc) and a uronic acid (either IdoA or GlcA) or the neutral sugar galactose. GAGs have a variety of biological functions, including cell signaling, proliferation, and wound healing, as a result of their structural diversity, and are ubiquitously found on the surface of cells, where they act as receptors and signals for cellular and pathogenic processes [36]. Viruses or other pathogens utilize this structural diversity of GAGs to selectively bind and enter the cells [37]. The virion attachment caused by GAG binding and eventual entry are usually independent events, with attachment assumed to be mostly nonspecific and charge-dependent but, instead, entry is thought to be driven by highly specific protein–protein interactions. We have recently shown that HS–virus interactions are specific and depend on a defined structural functional relationship [12,15,28]. Interactions with HS are a frequent prerequisite for many viral infections [38,39]. As a result, inhibitors targeting virus–HS interactions have the potential to function as broad-spectrum antivirals that could have a significant influence on global health. Many compounds including small organic and inorganic compounds, as well as polycationic peptides, have been employed to bind to HS and thereby protect the cells from viral attachment [40,41,42,43]. Conversely, inhibitors may bind to virion components to sequester and inactivate the virions very similarly to neutralizing antibodies [44]. These are mostly HS mimetics, and many of them have broad-spectrum antiviral action. In this study, we investigated the anti-HMCV activities of two GAGs: (i) heparin, a highly sulfated linear GAG widely exploited as in research [45], and (ii) PpFucCS, a unique marine branched GAG. From our results, we were able to compare the anti-HCMV activity of PpFucCS and its LWW fractions with the commonly used control heparin. Since the use of heparin can lead to excessive bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, PpFucCS offers a reasonable alternative to be developed as an antiviral. The inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. The native high MW structure is necessary to achieve maximum HMCV inhibition. Upon hydrolysis (depolymerization) to generate the oligosaccharide mixture (HdPpFuCS), the activity was considerably decreased. However, Fr1 had more anti-HMCV activity compared to HdPpFucCS, most likely because HdPpFucCS has significant amounts of less active components (Fr2–Fr4: nearly 3/4 of the amount). Moreover, Fr4 has a degraded structure. All the PpFucCS fractions (Fr1–Fr3) show the same 1D 1H NMR spectral profile as the native, therefore indicating they have the same structure [30]. The only exception is Fr4, which was spectrally different and structurally degraded. We recently observed a similar behavior of MW dependence on anticoagulation and anti-SARS-CoV-2 actions of PpFucCS [30]. However, for the sulfated galactan from the red alga Botryocladia occidentalis (BoSG), the reduction in the chain length was able to dissociate the anticoagulant and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities [31]. The results from this current work support the first case, in which the high MW of the marine sulfated glycan, in this case PpFucCS, is a key element for the biological activity. The current results regarding the anti-HCMV activity of PpFucCS perfectly match our recent findings regarding the anticoagulation and anti-SARS-CoV-2 action of PpFucCS [30].",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions The current results demonstrate the antiviral activities of marine sulfated glycan PpFucCS against HCMV, which is an enveloped DNA virus. Earlier, our group successfully used a copper-based Fenton approach for the free-radical depolymerization of PpFucCS to produce oligosaccharides with shorter chain lengths but preserved the structural integrity, so it was similar to the native PpFucCS [30]. Our findings imply that a native PpFucCS structure with a large MW is essential for achieving the greatest anti-HCMV activity. The retained effective inhibitory potential of high MW structures derived from PpFucCS suggests this marine glycan is a promising candidate for further evaluation and development as a potential antiviral.",

Copyright notice ID: 10142442 PMID: 37112839 Abstract Many viruses attach to host cells by first interacting with cell surface proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains and then by engaging with specific receptor, resulting in virus entry. In this project, HS–virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) fractions and the virus yield at five days post-infection was assessed. The virus attachment and entry into the cells were visualized by labeling the purified virus particles with a self-quenching fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine B (R18). The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV specifically blocking virus entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. PpFucCS and the derived oligosaccharides did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity; moreover, they protected the infected cells from virus-induced lytic cell death. In conclusion, PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells and the high MW of this carbohydrate is a key structural element to achieve the maximal anti-viral effect. This new marine sulfated glycan can be developed into a potential prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infection. Keywords: herpesviruses, marine sulfated glycans, virus entry1. Introduction Betaherpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), are common human pathogens, yet only a small percentage of infected people experience acute illness [1]. In people with impaired immune systems, HCMV-mediated infections can be life-threatening. Despite significant advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic management of the disease, HCMV poses a serious threat in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients as well as in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients [2]. In addition, HCMV infection in utero is the leading cause of congenital infection that can result in developmental abnormalities, including sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delays, and even fetal death [3,4,5]. There are currently no commercially available vaccines to prevent HCMV infection [6] and only a small number of drugs, including ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, maribavir, and letermovir, have been Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment/prophylaxis of HCMV infection and disease [7,8]. Moreover, drug resistance is increasingly common with circulating strains acquiring UL54 (polymerase) and/or UL97 (kinase) mutations that confer resistance to commonly available drugs [9,10,11]. Therefore, the identification of newer anti-HCMV drugs with improved efficacy and novel modes of action are essentially needed. Heparan sulfate (HS) is present on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix of most mammalian tissues [12,13]. Numerous viruses including HCMV attach to host cells by first engaging with cell surface HS glycosaminoglycan chains, followed by interaction with the specific protein receptors, which results in virus entry [14,15]. HCMV can infect different types of cells and tissues indicating that it can engage with a wide variety of host cell receptors to enter the cell and establish an infection [16,17,18,19]. Specific viral glycoproteins engage these structurally and functionally distinct receptors that include the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, cellular integrins, neuropilin-2, and epidermal growth factor receptor [20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. Earlier, our group showed that HCMV preferentially binds to uniquely sulfated and polymerized HS using its surface glycoprotein B (gB) [15]. HS mimetics, including heparin, bind to gB and inhibit HCMV infection by competitively inhibiting virus attachment to the cell surface [15,27]. Heparin is composed of disaccharide-repeating units (Figure 1A) and is an efficient anticoagulant; it can cause excessive bleeding and thrombocytopenia that necessitate close patient observation and, if necessary, the administration of an antidote (protamine) [28,29]. Two potential solutions to these anticoagulant side effects are using either the naturally potent anti-viral sulfated glycans with lower anticoagulant properties or the dissociation of the anticoagulant and anti-viral properties of the existing heparin. We were able to provide instances of both in our earlier work [28,30,31]. In contrast to heparin, a newly discovered fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (FucCS) from the body wall of the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) was found to have significantly lower anticoagulant activity but significant antiviral efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [28]. The PpFucCS anticoagulant activity can be further reduced by hydrolysis into oligosaccharide fractions [30]. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Structural representation of sulfated glycans assayed for anti-HCMV activity. (A) Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is mostly composed of repeating disaccharide units of [→4)-α-GlcN-(1→4)-α-IdoA-(1→] where GlcN is glucosamine and IdoA is iduronic acid. Sulfation occurs frequently at the N- and C6-positions of GlcN and C2 position of IdoA. (B) PpFucCS is constituted of a chondroitin sulfate backbone that alternates N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) in repeating disaccharide units of [→3)-β-GalNAc-(1→4)-β-GlcA-(1→], where the GalNAc units are primarily 4-sulfated (80%) and, to a very less degree, 4,6-disulfated (10%) or nonsulfated (10%). The GlcA units are replaced at the C3 position by three different forms of α-fucose (Fuc) branches: Fuc2,4S-(1→(40%), Fuc2,4S-(1→4)-Fuc-(1→(30%), and Fuc4S-(1→(30%); where S = SO3−.In the current investigation, PpFucCS (Figure 1B) was used to target HS–virus interaction and prevent HCMV entry into cells. We show that PpFucCS has significant antiviral activity against HCMV and that, when hydrolyzed into fractions, the oligosaccharides lose their anti-HCMV activity in a size-dependent manner.2. Materials and Methods PpFucCS extraction and purification: As previously reported [30], PpFucCS was recovered from the body wall of the sea cucumber P. pygmaea (Gulf Specimen Lab Gulf of Mexico, Florida Keys) by performing proteolytic digestion using papain (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Using anion exchange chromatography, the dry crude extract was fractionated on a 1.5 cm × 20 cm column packed with DEAE-Sephacel resin (Sigma). It was then eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl in 0.1 M NaOAc at pH 6.0 from 0 M to 3 M with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. 1,9-dimethyl methylene blue (DMB) reagent was used to monitor each fraction. The polysaccharide fractions that were detected using the DMB assay were combined, dialyzed three times against water, and then lyophilized to concentrate for preservation and transportation. The dialyzed sugars were then subjected to purification using a Sephadex G15 (Sigma) column (1 cm × 30 cm) with water as the mobile phase for cleanup. The lyophilization was performed to purify the sugar. To estimate the concentration of the samples in the various assays, dry weight measurements were collected. PpFucCS Depolymerization: PpFucCS was depolymerized using a modified Fenton technique that has been demonstrated to be extremely selective for the breakage of GlcA and GalNAc bonds found in the backbone of this class of polysaccharides [30]. A previously described methodology that had been slightly changed was used to carry out the reaction; 40 mg of dry-weight PpFucCS was weighed and dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in 0.1 M sodium acetate at a pH of 6.0 to optimize the reaction conditions; 0.02 mM copper (II) acetate (final concentration) was then added to the dissolved polysaccharide solution. The reaction was carried out for 180 min at 60 °C with constant stirring after the addition of 200 mM H2O2 in drops to the reaction liquid. By removing the copper ions from the reaction mixture using Chelex (50–100 mesh size) resin, the reaction was quenched by adding Chelex resin that had been pre-equilibrated using 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, and keeping it on an end-to-end rotor for 2 h at room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min after 2 h. The supernatant was lyophilized and desalted. Fractionation of PpFucCS oligosaccharides: The dried depolymerized mixture of PpFucCS was fractionated depending on the size in a Bio-Gel P-10 column (1.5 cm × 170 cm), at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/15 min. A 10% ethanol solution containing 1.0 M NaCl was used to fractionate the mixture. Hydrolyzed PpFucCS (HdPpFucCS) is native PpFucCS that has been subjected to depolymerization The fractions obtained were assayed for the presence of PpFucCS oligosaccharides using DMB. The eluted oligosaccharides were divided into 4 fractions (Fr1–Fr4) based on the DMB profile and their corresponding retention times on the Bio-Gel P-10 column. Before any analysis, all the fractions were desalted on the Sephadex G-15 column and then lyophilized. See [30]. Distribution of PpFucCS oligosaccharides: Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was used to analyze the oligosaccharide distribution of the depolymerized PpFucCS fractions [30]. PpFucCS oligosaccharides structural integrity determination: The structural integrity of the PpFucCS oligosaccharides produced was investigated using one-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1D 1H NMR) spectroscopy [30]. Cells: The human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Corning, Manassas, VA, USA, catalog No. 10-013-CM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA, catalog No. 10437-028), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Corning, Manassas, VA, USA; catalog No. 30-002-CI) at 37 °C along with 5% CO2 [32]. Virus: HCMV (TowneBAC strain) tagged with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) [33] was grown on the HFF cells. The virus stock was prepared in 3X autoclaved milk, sonicated three times for 10 s with a 30 s gap, and stored at −80 °C. For the preparation of the autoclaved milk, we dissolved Nestle Carnation instant nonfat dry milk powder in nanopure water at neutral pH to obtain 10% milk [6,15,34], which was then autoclaved three consecutive times before storage at 4 °C. Virus infections: For infecting the HFFs, the media was removed from the wells of the cell culture plates, washed with serum-free medium DMEM, and appropriately diluted virus stock was absorbed on the cells in DMEM without serum. The cells were incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking every 10 min followed by washing thrice with serum-free DMEM. Fresh complete DMEM was added, and the cells were incubated until the endpoint. IC50 assay and percent inhibition calculation: To determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of PpFucCS, its hydrolyzed form, and its fractions, the HFFs were pretreated for 1 h with a range of concentrations (50 μg/mL, 25 μg/mL, 12.5 μg/mL, 6.25 μg/mL, 3.12 μg/mL, 1.56 μg/mL, and 0.78 μg/mL), UFH, or mock, and then infected with HCMV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The cells were fixed at 5 days post-infection (dpi), and the number of GFP-positive cells for each concentration was enumerated using the Cytation 5 automated microscope (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The experiment was repeated three times in order to confirm the reproducibility of the measurements. The data were normalized in GraphPad Prism 9.0, using the number of GFP-positive cells in the mock wells as 0% inhibition and the number ‘0′ as 100% inhibition. The percentage (%) inhibition was plotted against the concentration range. The relative IC50s were calculated using a fixed top limit of the average vehicle-only control and a floating bottom limit. For virus yield reduction assays, the HFFs were pretreated for 1 h with a range of concentrations (50 μg/mL, 25 μg/mL, 12.5 μg/mL, 6.25 μg/mL, 3.12 μg/mL, 1.56 μg/mL, and 0.78 μg/mL), of PpFucCS and mock (in duplicates of two independent experiments), and then infected with HCMV at a MOI of 3. The samples were harvested within the medium at 5 dpi by scraping the cells and stored at −80 °C before titration. On the day of titration, the harvested samples were sonicated three times for 10 s each with a 30 s gap. The monolayers of the HFFs were grown in 12-well tissue culture plates, and serial dilutions of the sonicated samples in the DMEM (without any additional compounds) were absorbed onto them for 1 h (in duplicates), followed by washing thrice with serum-free DMEM. For the viral titers, fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and gamma immunoglobulin was added to the HFFs. At this step, no native PpFucCS was added to the overlayed medium, and the cells were incubated for from 9 to 10 dpi. At the endpoint, the DMEM overlay was removed, and the cells were washed 2X using PBS. The infected HFFs were then fixed in 100% methanol for 5 min. The HFFs were immediately stained using Modified Giemsa stain (Sigma-Aldrich, Milli-pore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA, catalog No. GS1L) for 15 minutes. the plates were then washed with tap water and air dried, and the dark stained plaques were quantified. Octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) labeling and entry assay: The appropriate amount of virus was incubated using R18 (20 ng/L) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA, catalog No. O246) at 4 °C for 1 h. An equal volume of DMEM was added and the tube was centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C to pellet the labeled virus, which was resuspended in 200 μL of DMEM. The native PpFucCS (50 μg/mL) was overlayed on the cells (HFF) for 1 h at 37 °C, and the plate was then incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. The purified virus, labeled with R18, was added to the plate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the pre-treated cells to allow for virus attachment. Thereafter, the unbound virus was washed off using PBS and the plate was moved to 37 °C to allow for virus entry. The plates were fixed for staining with Hoechst dye at different time points after the 37 °C move. The mock-treated cells with the labeled and unlabeled virus were used as controls. Microscopy: The samples were prepared using the established protocols for fluorescence microscopy. Briefly, the HFF cells were grown on coverslip inserts in 24-well tissue culture plates. The cells were pretreated using PpFucCS at 50 μg/mL concentration for 1 h and cooled at 4 °C for 15 min before infection using R18-labeled HCMV at a MOI of 3.0. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C along with 5% CO2 for 1 h. At the different time points (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min) after the shift to 37 °C, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and incubated in 50 mM NH4Cl in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min to reduce autofluorescence and washed using 2X PBS. Finally, the cells were incubated in Hoechst solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Catalog No. 33342) in PBS (1:3000) for 10 min to stain the nucleus, followed by a PBS wash. The coverslips were retrieved from the wells and were mounted on glass slides with a drop of mounting medium (2.5% DABCO in Fluoromont G) and air dried for two hours before imaging. The images were acquired on an EVOS-FL epifluorescent microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell viability: The HFFs were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates and grown to confluency (in triplicates). The cells were pretreated for 1 h with the highest concentration of test compounds and controls and then infected with HCMV at a MOI of 3.0 or mock infected. The medium was removed at 5 dpi, and the HFFs were harvested using trypsinization. The cell viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion using a TC20 automated cell counter (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The test was also performed using the native PpFucCS at 500 µg/mL via the trypan blue exclusion assay along with the ATP release assay. We performed the bioluminescent ATP assay by overlaying the compounds for five days on the confluent HFF in an opaque-walled 96-well tissue culture plate with blank controls using a CellTiter-Glo 2.0 Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA, Catalog No. G9242) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The ATP luminescence was measured using a Cytation 7 automated microscope (BioTek Instruments, Inc.) with the Endpoint/Kinetic read type using a single wavelength with the appropriate gain. The viability experiments were repeated two times to confirm the measurements. Statistics: The data were plotted in Graphpad Prism (Version 9.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA, www.graphpad.com, accessed on 3 March 2023). The standard error of the mean was plotted as error bars. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. An asterisk (*) denotes a significant inhibition compared to the mock. The data were evaluated using one-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism 9.0 for multiple comparisons, and the differences between the groups were considered significant at a p-value of less than 0.05.3. Results 3.1. Inhibition of HCMV by PpFucCS and Its Fractions Here, we investigated the inhibitory activity of both native PpFucCS and its LMW fractions against HCMV. The LMW PpFucCS oligosaccharides studied here were used to establish a structural activity relationship and the influence of MW distribution on its anti-viral activity against HCMV. The native PpFucCS exhibited potent and efficacious inhibitory activity against HCMV while the PpFucCS fractions showed decreased activity in both potency and efficacy (Figure 2A). Comparing the mean inhibition at the highest concentration used (50 μg/mL), we show that the efficacy of native PpFucCS along with the unfractionated but hydrolyzed PpFucCS oligosaccharide mixture (HdPpFucCS) and Fr1 was comparable to UFH, but it was significantly lower in the case of Fr2, Fr3, and Fr4 (Figure 2B). Additionally, the native PpFucCS had the least half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value amongst all the tests and was comparable to that of UFH (Table 1). Thus, based on the comparison of low MW PpFucCS products, it is evident that HdPpFucCS and Fr1 maintain better antiviral activity than Fr2, Fr3, and Fr4 while displaying only slightly less activity than native PpFucCS and UFH. Earlier, our 1D 1H NMR spectra showed the presence of four fucose units in Fr1–Fr3 that were similar to the native PpFucCS structure: α- Fuc2,4S, α-Fuc2,4S, α-Fuc4S, and α-Fuc0S [30]. This indicates that, although Fr1–Fr3 differ in size, they have similar structures. The Fuc anomeric peaks in fraction 4 showed an upfield 1H shift, which may indicate desulfation. Interestingly, the Fenton chemistry demonstrated a preserved structural integrity of the native PpFucCS in the majority of the oligosaccharides produced (Fr1–Fr3), and only a small percentage of the very low MW (Fr4) showed more chemical modifications [30]. Combining these recently published results with the current results, it is evident that PpFucCS oligosaccharides lose their anti-HCMV activity in a size-dependent manner and that structural features play a crucial role in their anti-viral activity. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Anti-HCMV activity of PpFucCS oligosaccharides. PpFucCS oligosaccharides were assayed for their potential to inhibit the HCMV (GFP-tagged TowneBAC strain) infection in HFFs (MOI 0.1) by enumerating the cells expressing GFP. (A) Normalized values from the assay were analyzed by nonlinear regression to fit a dose–response curve using the least squares method considering each repeated measure as an individual point. The plotted curve shows the percentage of HCMV inhibition in a (log) concentration-dependent manner. Curves in the plot represent the following: PpFucCS (red), HdPpFucCS (green), Fr1 (navy), Fr2 (purple), Fr3 (blue), Fr4 (brown), and UFH (black). (B) Using the normalized values from the same assay, we calculated the percentage inhibition at the maximum concentration used (Imax) and compared with the UFH at the same concentration (50 µg/mL) by performing one-way ANOVA test with multiple comparisons by comparing the means of each test with control UFH, and corrected using a Dunnett’s post hoc test, showing significant differences among the means. The results are representative of three independent experiments. The standard error of the mean was plotted as error bars. The ***, **, and ns (non-significant) indicate p-value < 0.001, from 0.001 to 0.01, and ≥0.05, respectively.Table 1. IC50 values of anti-viral activities of PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides. The IC50 values of anti-HCMV inhibitory activity of PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides were determined in HFFs. Considering the role of avidity often found in protein–glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions and the broad range of molecular weights of the compounds, IC50 values were measured in terms of µg/mL rather than the molar units.

The IC50 obtained by performing this assay (2.957 µg/mL) (Figure S1) is very close to the IC50 (3.6 µg/mL) determined by the GFP reduction assay conducted at a low MOI (0.01) (Table 1), thus indicating that the inhibitory properties of PpFucCS against HCMV do not depend on the MOI.3.2. PpFucCS Specifically Inhibits HCMV Entry into Cells To assess whether PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells (HFFs), we utilized the TowneBAC strain of the HCMV labeled with a self-quenching fluorescent label (R18 fluorescence assay). The fluorescence was recorded at different time intervals starting from 0 to 60 min post infection (Figure 3). The R18 dye transitions from one monolayer of a fluid-state phospholipid bilayer membrane to another in a potential-dependent manner, somewhat relieving the quenching of its fluorescence [35]. The fluorescence from the HCMV virus particles that have been labeled with high quantities of R18 is highly self-quenched and their fusion with the host cell membrane leads to an increase in fluorescence, which is often visible only after the virus has entered the cell. A significantly higher number of virus particles entered the mock-treated cells compared to the cells treated with native PpFucCS at 60 min post infection (Figure 3A,B). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Inhibition of HCMV entry into the HFF cells by native PpFucCS. The primary HFF were challenged by the unlabeled (a) or R18 labeled (b–i) TowneBAC strain of HCMV at a MOI of 3.0. The HFFs were either mock treated (a–c) or pretreated for one hour using PpFucCS (50 μg/mL) (d–i). The number of fluorescent virus particles were enumerated at different time points post infection and plotted in Graphpad Prism 9. The HFFs were either mock treated and infected with the unlabeled virus at ‘60′ min (a), or mock treated and infected with the R18 labeled virus at ‘0′ min (b), ‘60′ min (c), or PpFucCS-treated and infected with the R18 labeled virus at ‘0′ min (d), ‘5′ min (e), ‘10′ min (f), ‘20′ min (g), ‘40′ min (h), and ‘60′ min (i). (A) Images showing the different groups either treated or mock treated. The cell nuclei appear blue fluorescent while the red fluorescent virus particles are indicated by the circle and arrows. (B) Bar plot represents the number of fluorescent virus particles per image field for treatment groups at different time points. The results are representative of four independent experiments and were analyzed by performing one-way ANOVA test with multiple comparisons (comparing the means of each test with mock-treated control at ‘60′ min). The standard error of the mean was plotted as error bars. The ***, and ns indicate p-value < 0.001, and ≥0.05, respectively.3.3. Effect of PpFucCS and Its Oligosaccharides Treatment on Cell Viability PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides do not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity against primary HFF cells when examined at the highest concentration used in the antiviral assay (50 μg/mL) (Figure 4A) and show a protective effect against virus-induced cell death at five days post infection (Figure 4B) when examined using a trypan blue exclusion assay. Notably, the Fr3 and Fr4 that did not show any significant antiviral activity (Figure 2) also did not show any significant protection from virus-induced cell death. Furthermore, we did not see any cytotoxic effect on the HFFs when treated with the native PpFucCS at 500 μg/mL for five days using the trypan blue exclusion assay (Figure S2). To corroborate these findings, we treated the HFFs with the native PpFucCS at 500 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL along with heparin control for five days and performed the ATP release assay (Figure S3). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Effect of treatment of PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides on cell viability of HFF cells. The primary HFF were pretreated for one hour using PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides at the highest concentration used for inhibition assays (50 μg/mL) along with heparin (UFH) control. The HFFs were either mock infected (A) or infected with HCMV at a MOI of 3.0 (B) in the presence of test compounds. Cells were harvested at 5 days post-infection and cell viability was assessed using a trypan blue exclusion assay. The results are representative of two independent experiments. The standard error of the mean was plotted as error bars. The **, *, and ns indicate p-value between 0.001 and 0.01, between 0.01 and 0.05, and ≥0.05, respectively.4. Discussion In this study, we demonstrated that PpFucCS and its hydrolyzed fractions efficiently inhibit the HCMV infection of primary human fibroblasts, specifically blocking virus entry into the cells. The treatment of HFFs with native PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides did not affect the cell viability for the duration of treatment, thus confirming that the observed reduction in the virus titer was not because of cytotoxicity. Moreover, when the HFFs were pretreated and maintained in these marine glycans throughout the course of infection, the cells resisted infection-induced cell death. To confirm that PpFucCS has a direct impact on virus entry, we used HCMV labeled with self-quenching dye that only fluoresces when the virus fuses with the cell membrane. This experiment showed the significant effect of PpFucCS on HCMV entry. GAGs are composed of repeating disaccharide units that contain an amino sugar (either GalNAc or GlcNAc) and a uronic acid (either IdoA or GlcA) or the neutral sugar galactose. GAGs have a variety of biological functions, including cell signaling, proliferation, and wound healing, as a result of their structural diversity, and are ubiquitously found on the surface of cells, where they act as receptors and signals for cellular and pathogenic processes [36]. Viruses or other pathogens utilize this structural diversity of GAGs to selectively bind and enter the cells [37]. The virion attachment caused by GAG binding and eventual entry are usually independent events, with attachment assumed to be mostly nonspecific and charge-dependent but, instead, entry is thought to be driven by highly specific protein–protein interactions. We have recently shown that HS–virus interactions are specific and depend on a defined structural functional relationship [12,15,28]. Interactions with HS are a frequent prerequisite for many viral infections [38,39]. As a result, inhibitors targeting virus–HS interactions have the potential to function as broad-spectrum antivirals that could have a significant influence on global health. Many compounds including small organic and inorganic compounds, as well as polycationic peptides, have been employed to bind to HS and thereby protect the cells from viral attachment [40,41,42,43]. Conversely, inhibitors may bind to virion components to sequester and inactivate the virions very similarly to neutralizing antibodies [44]. These are mostly HS mimetics, and many of them have broad-spectrum antiviral action. In this study, we investigated the anti-HMCV activities of two GAGs: (i) heparin, a highly sulfated linear GAG widely exploited as in research [45], and (ii) PpFucCS, a unique marine branched GAG. From our results, we were able to compare the anti-HCMV activity of PpFucCS and its LWW fractions with the commonly used control heparin. Since the use of heparin can lead to excessive bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, PpFucCS offers a reasonable alternative to be developed as an antiviral. The inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. The native high MW structure is necessary to achieve maximum HMCV inhibition. Upon hydrolysis (depolymerization) to generate the oligosaccharide mixture (HdPpFuCS), the activity was considerably decreased. However, Fr1 had more anti-HMCV activity compared to HdPpFucCS, most likely because HdPpFucCS has significant amounts of less active components (Fr2–Fr4: nearly 3/4 of the amount). Moreover, Fr4 has a degraded structure. All the PpFucCS fractions (Fr1–Fr3) show the same 1D 1H NMR spectral profile as the native, therefore indicating they have the same structure [30]. The only exception is Fr4, which was spectrally different and structurally degraded. We recently observed a similar behavior of MW dependence on anticoagulation and anti-SARS-CoV-2 actions of PpFucCS [30]. However, for the sulfated galactan from the red alga Botryocladia occidentalis (BoSG), the reduction in the chain length was able to dissociate the anticoagulant and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities [31]. The results from this current work support the first case, in which the high MW of the marine sulfated glycan, in this case PpFucCS, is a key element for the biological activity. The current results regarding the anti-HCMV activity of PpFucCS perfectly match our recent findings regarding the anticoagulation and anti-SARS-CoV-2 action of PpFucCS [30].5. Conclusions The current results demonstrate the antiviral activities of marine sulfated glycan PpFucCS against HCMV, which is an enveloped DNA virus. Earlier, our group successfully used a copper-based Fenton approach for the free-radical depolymerization of PpFucCS to produce oligosaccharides with shorter chain lengths but preserved the structural integrity, so it was similar to the native PpFucCS [30]. Our findings imply that a native PpFucCS structure with a large MW is essential for achieving the greatest anti-HCMV activity. The retained effective inhibitory potential of high MW structures derived from PpFucCS suggests this marine glycan is a promising candidate for further evaluation and development as a potential antiviral.Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v15040859/s1, Figure S1: Anti-HCMV activity of native PpFucCS; Figure S2: Effect of cytotoxicity of PpFucCS at a higher concentration on HFF cells; Figure S3: Assessing the cytotoxicity of PpFucCS by quantifying the ATP release.

    "abstract": "Abstract Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members. Keywords: cytomegalovirus, radiation, galactic cosmic radiation, spaceflight, herpes viral reactivation",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Infection by cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpesvirus family, is highly prevalent in the human population, with estimated rates of infection ranging from 50% in developed countries to 90% in developing countries [1]. Herpes viruses of this nature have co-evolved with humans [2], and even more grandly, viruses in general have recently been regarded as integral and essential to the evolution of life on Earth [3]. This symbiosis is highlighted by the fact that humans become infected for life with these viruses, and primary infections are largely asymptomatic, although some immunocompetent patients may develop infectious mononucleosis. Regardless, all patients then become latently infected, meaning that the CMV genome is present in the cell but no virus is being shed and the transcriptional activity of the virus is limited to a few genes. Stress (acute and chronic alike) and/or an immunocompromised status, such as people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or therapeutic immunosuppression, e.g., during hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT], can initiate reactivation of latent CMV, resulting in conditions including retinitis, pneumonitis, and, more rarely, hepatitis, gastrointestinal ulceration, nephritis, and pancreatitis [1]. Additionally, active CMV replication during pregnancy can lead to intrauterine infection of the fetus, with the potential for congenital CMV, the consequences of which can include microcephaly, blindness, and developmental delay [4,5]. While anti-viral agents, like ganciclovir [6], are suitable prophylactics or treatments, no “cure” for latent viral infections exists. Thus, studying the cause and effect of reactivations as well as promoting non-reactivating countermeasures is key to limiting the virus’s detrimental possibilities. Human space exploration presents a unique hostile environment difficult to replicate on Earth with hazards including microgravity, ionizing and non-ionizing cosmic radiation, physical and psychological stresses of traveling to and from space, altered diet and nutrition, continually interrupted sleep schedules, reduced protection from electromagnetic fields, and physical and social isolation. The synergistic effects of all these risks can trigger (or worsen) medical problems, potentially hindering performance during long-duration space missions [7]. Not surprisingly, these unique features of space exploration result in increased herpes viral (EBV, CMV, HSV1, and VZV) reactivation [2,8]. However, it is unclear whether these increases are due to a dysregulated immune system, one of the aforementioned features of spaceflight, or a combination with other factors. Previously, we reported that ionizing radiation (gamma, proton, carbon, and iron) increased EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation in AKATA cells latently infected with EBV [9]. In this study, we focused on the effect of space radiation to study CMV latency and reactivation, genomics, and transcriptomics. However, not only was individual ion radiation studied, but also the newly available simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The over-arching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce reactivation and specific changes in the CMV genome/transcriptome. To accomplish this goal, CMV genomes and transcriptomes were harvested from mock-exposed vs. radiation (proton, carbon, iron, gamma, and GCRsim) exposed Kasumi-3 cells latently infected with CMV and sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Irradiated cells showed reactivation of CMV based on viral loading, but genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. Transcriptomics, however, revealed significant differences in expression levels of several genes. Most importantly, UL49 was significantly (p < 0.026) upregulated with a log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48 in GCRsim-exposed Kasumi-3 cells compared with mock-exposed cells. Since UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression, it is possible that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to enhanced expression of UL49.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture Kasumi-3 cells (hematopoietic stem cell-derived monocyte progenitor cells) (ATCC CRL-2725, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (ATCC 30-2001) with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (ATCC 30-2020), 20 U/mL penicillin, and 20 µg/mL Streptomycin. Cultures were maintained in nominal conditions at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2. To achieve the cell numbers needed for all the experimental conditions, primary frozen cell aliquots were subcultured for about 2 months prior to irradiation procedures. 4.2. Experimental Conditions Kasumi-3 cells were infected with a low dose (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 1) of CMV (TB40/E strain) and allowed to establish latency (10 days of culture with monitored viral gene expression). Once CMV latency was established, 500,000 cells/mL were seeded in 25-cm2 (T-25) flasks and filled to capacity (70 mL) for transport to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Long Island, New York. Cell size, viability, and CMV viral load were determined from a pooled sample prior to transport and were regarded as pre-irradiation baselines (Day 2). Filtered flask caps were replaced with plug caps, tightened, and parafilm wrapped. Transport was overnight (≈18 h) from Johnson Space Center (JSC) to BNL. Once received at BNL, plug caps were loosened and flasks were kept upright in nominal incubator conditions overnight. The next day (irradiation day), duplicate flasks of the cells were exposed to acute doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) within each modeled radiation type (gamma, proton, carbon, iron, and GCRsim) at room temperature. Control flasks of mock-irradiated cells were also included and placed out of the incubator during radiation treatment. After irradiation, flasks were maintained in nominal incubator conditions overnight until transport back to the Johnson Space Center Immunology and Virology Laboratory (Houston, TX, USA) for analysis. Cells were then aseptically split and harvested from each flask by removing 25 mL of cells and media on Day 3 post-irradiation and then every three days following (i.e., Day 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15). Except for Day 15 (the last day), harvested cells and media were replaced with 25 mL of fresh RPMI 1640 complete media. For each harvest, cells were split into 3 subsamples and then frozen for analysis of cell count and characterization, determination of CMV viral load, and next generation sequencing. 4.3. Irradiation Setup At NSRL, the cells were exposed to an acute dose of radiation (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) or sham-irradiated at room temperature. Radiation doses of 5 Gy repeatedly killed all the cells, thus were not used. Irradiations were performed using 13 s gamma rays, individual ions (150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon, and 600 MeV/n iron ions), and the simulated Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRsim) beam. The irradiation times for gamma rays are given in Table 1. The ions used for the ion irradiation are detailed in Table 2. Table 1. 137Cs gamma ray irradiation settings.

For this experiment, the simplified GCRsim was used with the same total doses (10, 50, 100, and 200 cGy). The details of the beams, energies, dose rates, and irradiation times are given in Supplemental Document S1 (file Mehta NSRL 21B GCR 5-26-21 beam records Final). At the scale of the Kasumi-3 cells, the track structures of the radiation used for this study differ greatly from one type to another. It might be useful to consider the radiation track structure to understand the differences between radiation types in viral reactivation. The simulation of an irradiated volume of 10 µm × 10 µm × 5 µm by gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, iron ions, and the simulated GCR by the Monte-Carlo simulation code RITRACKS [19] is shown in Figure 4. The details of these calculations, including the use of periodic boundary conditions, are described elsewhere [20,21]. The simulated volume is roughly the size of one Kasumi-3 cell. The dose to the volume is approximately 0.2 Gy in all cases. This dose was chosen to better illustrate the difference between the tracks of different types of radiation. In Figure 4a, electron tracks corresponding to compton and photoelectron effects are observed. In Figure 4b, 230 proton tracks are shown. The LET of the proton used for the simulation was 0.54 keV/µm. Therefore, this is often considered sparsely ionizing radiation (as opposed to high-LET radiations). However, the energy distribution and spatial configuration of the tracks are quite different for the same dose of gamma rays and protons. Tracks from higher LET ions are also shown. In Figure 4c, 14 tracks from 600 MeV/n carbon ions are shown. In Figure 4d, only one track for 600 MeV/n iron ions is sufficient to yield a dose of ~0.2 Gy to the volume. In Figure 4e, the simulation of the irradiation by the GCR field is shown. Most of the tracks are proton and helium tracks. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Simulation of the irradiation of a volume by (a) 137Cs photons, (b) 150 MeV protons, (c) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, (d) 600 MeV/n iron ions, and (e) simulated GCR mixed field. In all cases, the dosage to the irradiated volume is ~0.2 Gy. 4.4. Cell Counts, Size, and Viability Aliquots from each flask were taken at each experimental day (Day 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15) and assessed for cell count (per mL), cell size (diameter in µm), and viability (percentage of live cells from total). Data were collected using a Cellometer Auto 2000 (Nexcelcom, Lawrence, MA, USA). In brief, a homogeneous sample of each cell culture flask was removed and mixed 1:1 with acridine orange and propidium iodide solution (AOPI) (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT, USA) and plated on Cellometer SD100 disposable slides for analysis [9]. 4.5. Determination of CMV Viral Load Frozen cells were thawed and pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. DNA was extracted from cell pellets with the Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) using the manufacturer’s instructions. Total DNA recovered from extractions was quantified by a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and Invitrogen™ Quant-iT™ Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). CMV DNA was quantified by Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) using a QuanStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Life technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). Each reaction mix (20 µL) contained 6.6 µL DNA and 13.4 µL of master mix (2X TaqMan Universal Master Mix, 830 nM IE-EX4 Forward, 830 nM IE-EX4 Reverse, 300 nM IE-EX4 Probe, 830 nM gB Forward, 830 nM gB Reverse, 300 nM gB Probe, and water). Primer and probe sequences were synthesized by IDT, Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA) and are listed in Table 3. Each sample was run in duplicate, and results were averaged. A housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was used for the qPCR assays. Viral load results (copies/µL) from the two duplicates were averaged and then normalized by the total cell count. For whole number simplification, values were multiplied by 10,000 to achieve the final variable (CMV copies/10,000 cells) used for statistical analysis and presentation in this manuscript. Table 3.

Genomics and Transcriptomics Commercial vendors were used for sequencing the genomes and RNA from exposed and control cells. Samples (cells) were shipped in frozen state on dry ice to the vendor for processing. Standard protocols for next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA and RNA were followed [22,23]. Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted from the samples and assessed for purity using fluorometric methods. The DNA, or cDNA (for transcriptomics), was used for library preparation. Nucleotides were read on an Illumina sequencer at a read length and depth that was considered appropriate for the current purpose of discovering nucleotide changes and transcript abundance. Data were analyzed on the Illumina Connected Software (https://help.connected.illumina.com/, 20 September 2024) and obtained as sequence files as well as datasheets containing relative quantities of transcripts. 4.7. Statistical Method Mixed models were applied to explore how CMV load, cell size, and viability change across days and different types of radiation and doses. To account for interactions between radiation type, dose, and days, mixed models with full three-way interaction terms were constructed. Random effects of flasks nested within radiation type were incorporated to address repeated measures. Robust standard errors were used to allow for non-homogeneous variance across time. The outcomes were assumed to follow a gamma distribution. Multiple comparisons between each group and the control group were adjusted using either simulation or the Bonferroni method. The alpha level was set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the software SAS 9.4. We conducted tests based on the mixed model described above. Specifically, we first compared each dose of radiation against the control group. Then, we compared the average of all radiation groups against the control group. Finally, we compared each dose against the control at each day post-radiation.",

All bars are mean ± SEM. 2.1. Viral Load Viral copy number is used to determine whether actual viral replication occurs from radiation as compared with the controls (non-irradiated cells but traveled to and from BNL with the irradiated cells). When analyzing all radiation sources together (Figure 1(A1)), 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy CMV viral loads were significantly higher (p < 0.001) as compared with controls throughout the entire experiment but also increased in the following order: control < 0.1 < 0.5 < 1.0 < 2.0. As shown in Figure 1(A1), the post-irradiation viral load in the CMV-infected Kasumi-3 cells decreased in controls as well as in all four radiation doses as compared with the pre-irradiation values (a separate set of the flasks for individual types of radiation but not irradiated). However, when the data were analyzed by timepoint (regardless of dose) (Figure 1(A2)), control and radiation both increased (non-significantly) post-radiation at Day 3 from an average of 18.27 to 23.53 and 22.21 copies/10,000 cells, respectively, and then tapered off as the experiment went on. Differences in viral load between control and radiation did not significantly occur until Day 12 (5.8 vs. 8.8 copies/10,000 cells, p < 0.001) and Day 15 (5.2 vs. 8.2 copies/10,000 cells, p < 0.01) (Figure 1(A2)). Within Day 12 and Day 15 (Figure 1(A3)), CMV viral load increased sequentially as dose increased, with all doses significantly different from control except for 0.1 Gy at Day 15. When sorting out the data from each radiation source, proton and gamma showed an increase in CMV viral load at Day 3 post-irradiation compared with the pre-irradiation samples (Figure 1(D2,E2)). All other radiation types, carbon, iron, and GCRsim, showed a decrease at Day 3 post-irradiation from their pre-irradiation levels (Figure 1(B2,C2,F2)). However, when analyzing irradiated samples by dose (Figure 1-column 1) compared with the controls, all radiation sources (except gamma) showed significant increases of CMV viral load, with the most increases seen in iron ion radiation at 2.0 Gy (+4.50 CMV copies/10,000 cells, Figure 1(C1)) and carbon 2.0 Gy (+2.87 CMV copies/10,000 cells, Figure 1(B1)). As mentioned previously, when analyzed according to different time points post-irradiation (Figure 1-column 2), the viral load increased or was roughly the same as the pre-irradiation values and then started to decrease on Days 6, 9, 12, and 15 for all the radiation sources. Significant differences compared with controls were found in proton and GCRsim at Day 9 (p < 0.001) (Figure 1(E2,F2)) and carbon and iron at Day 12 (p < 0.001) (Figure 1(B2,C2)). We also compared the results of viral load post each irradiation type and at each timepoint with their own respective controls (Figure 1-column 3). Viral load values were consistently higher post-radiation as compared with the control samples at each time point for all the experiments except for carbon and iron on Day 9 (Figure 1(B3,C3)) and gamma on Day 3 (Figure 1(D3)), which showed a decrease post-irradiation. A significant increase was observed 12 days post-irradiation for all sources as compared with their controls (Figure 1(A3)). For individual radiation types, carbon and iron showed an effect 3 days and beyond post-radiation (Figure 1(B3,C3)), while proton and GCRsim did not show any significant effect until 9 days post-irradiation (Figure 1(E3,F3)). Gamma did show an increasing trend, but this difference was not statistically significant (Figure 1(D3)). 2.2. Cell Viability The cell viability was 86.3 to 89.9% before the cells were transported to NSRL (i.e., pre-irradiation values from each experiment). The trauma of transport negatively affected cell viability of Kasumi-3 cells infected with CMV, as evidenced by the substantial reduction in live cells in the control conditions (Figure 2). Radiation further significantly reduced the viability at all the dosages in an increasing order (control < 0.1 < 0.5 < 1.0 < 2.0) when compared with the controls for all sources (Figure 2(A1)). As represented in Figure 2(A2), the viability started to recover 9 days post-irradiation (controls: 70.25 ± 2.20%; radiation: 58.39 ± 2.12%) as compared with Day 3 (controls: 44.56 ± 2.57%; radiation: 41.89 ± 1.00%) and Day 6 (controls: 43.23 ± 1.86%; radiation: 39.96 ± 1.10%). The irradiated groups were significantly less viable than their corresponding controls at each timepoint (p < 0.001) except for Day 6 (Figure 2(A2)). The biggest fall was found at 2.0 Gy irradiation compared with controls at every timepoint analyzed (p < 0.001, Figure 2(A3)). When sorting out each radiation source, proton and gamma showed the least reduction in viability compared with controls (max reduction at 2.0 Gy: proton = −5.94%, Figure 2(E1), and gamma = −10.93%, Figure 2(D1)). Carbon, iron, and GCRsim (except GCRsim 0.1 Gy, Figure 2(B1,C1,F1)) all showed significant decreases in cell viability compared with controls, with the most decreases seen in iron 2.0 Gy (−26.42%) and carbon 2.0 Gy (−17.81%). Proton and gamma radiation had significant reductions in viability at Day 12 (p < 0.01, Figure 2(D2,E2)), which were driven in large part by the higher dose radiations at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy (Figure 2(D3,E3)). Gamma radiation also had a significant reduction in viability at Day 15 (p < 0.001, Figure 2(D2)). Carbon, iron, and GCRsim all had significant reductions in viability at Days 9 and 12 (Figure 2(B2,C2,F2)), with the higher doses contributing to that the most (Figure 2(B3,C3,F3)). Carbon and iron also had reductions in viability at Days 3 and 15 (Figure 2(B2,C2)). 2.3. Cell Size The normal size of Kasumi-3 cells infected with CMV is around 9.0 µm. In our data set, pre-irradiation cell size ranged from 9.2 to 9.4 µm (i.e., pre-irradiation values from each experiment). Post-irradiation saw a general increase in the size of these cells as compared with their respective controls for all the sources (Figure 3(A1)). However, a significant increase was only found at 2.0 Gy irradiation dose for all the sources (9.5 ± 0.1 to 10.1 ± 0.2; p < 0.001, Figure 3(A1)), but is evident by the fact that each individual radiation source had a significant cell size increase at 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(B1–E1)). For individual sources, iron showed a significant increase at 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(C1)), carbon showed at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(B1)), gamma was significant at all doses (Figure 3(D1)), proton showed at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(E1)), and GCRsim showed at 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(F1)), respectively. It was interesting to notice that this increase was observed 9 days post-irradiation for all sources (Figure 3(A2)) and at individual sources gamma and protons (Figure 3(D2,E2)). For post-GCRsim irradiation treatment, an increase in cell size was apparent even three days after treatment for doses of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 Gy (Figure 3(E2,E3)). Similar to the other individual radiation sources, GCRsim cell sizes also increased at Day 9 (Figure 3(E2)), which coincided with a dose of 2.0 Gy having statistical significance, which continued into Day 12s and 15 (Figure 3(E3)). 2.4. Genomics Kasumi cells from the above experiments were subjected to genomic analysis in order to reveal any single nucleotide polymorphisms or other possible variations in the genomes of irradiated cells compared with mock. For this purpose, total nucleic acid (TNA) was extracted from the Kasumi-3 cells from the above experiment. The recovered TNA was subjected to DNA analysis. The same TNA was also used for transcriptional analysis described below. The initial set of 22 samples (pre-radiation, D6, D12, GCR, Proton) did not reveal statistically significant genomic variants upon comparison among the groups. This finding indicates that there were no stable genomic alterations induced by irradiation during this study. 2.5. Transcriptomics The TNA recovered from this study was also examined for differences in transcriptional activity of the CMV genome in the irradiated and unirradiated groups. Data from the GCR-Day 6 cells compared with mock-exposed cells indicate that differential expression seems to be occurring, but these changes do not register as statistically significant (Supplemental Document S2). However, the UL49 sequence shows a significant (p < 0.026) increase in expression reflected as log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48, summarized in Supplemental Document S1.",
    "discussion": "3. Discussion Herpes viral reactivations in astronauts have generally been subclinical. However, medical events with viral etiology have occurred during spaceflight [10]. The cause of those reactivations, whether symptomatic or not, is not fully understood. Spaceflight imposes a multitude of stressors on the human body that can potentially directly (i.e., space radiation, microgravity) or indirectly (i.e., dysregulated immunity) cause the reactivation of herpes viruses. Our group has previously shown that lytic gene transcription of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), which is consistently elevated in astronaut samples, is directly activated by a variety of radiation types and doses [9]. In the current study, we examined how ionizing radiation reactivated cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the Kasumi-3 myeloblast cell line. The GCR Simulator Project at NSRL generates an accelerator-based spectrum of energies that closely approximate those that are known to make up the shielded GCR environment in space, thus providing a unique Earthbound system to test CMV reactivation in culture for spaceflight applications. In the current study, we tested the effect of carbon, iron, proton, gamma, and GCRsim individually across several doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) on CMV viral load, genomics, and transcriptomics. The CMV viral load in the infected Kasumi cells, taken as a whole, significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner, with increases seen at Day 3 at all the dosages tested, which tapered off through Day 15. However, at Days 12 and 15, the most significant viral load changes were seen at almost all doses compared with their corresponding controls. Surprisingly, however, carbon, iron, and GCRsim all had viral loads at Day 3 in controls and radiation groups that were either similar to or less than their respective pre-irradiation levels (Figure 1). Additionally, no radiation (at any dose) produced an increase in CMV at Day 3 or Day 6 compared with the control samples. In other words, if an increase in CMV viral load was seen early on for post-irradiation cells, it also occurred in the control flasks. We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the loss of cell viability resulting from cell transport from JSC to NSRL. Cells experience harsh conditions at the loading docks before and after shipping, including suboptimal temperature, humidity, and %CO2. Ideally, cell cultures would be undisturbed outside of experimental conditions, sample aliquoting, and media changes. However, with the NSRL facility located in New York, it was not feasible to do the many months-long pre-irradiation cell culture and infections outside our primary NASA facility at JSC. Based on our previous experiments using the latently infected EBV Akata cells, we did not anticipate such dampening of the experimental findings from the logistics of travel. We found that the cell viability decreased from 88.33% (before radiation) to 44.56% in controls and 41.89% in the irradiated groups (at Day 3 after radiation), accounting for a significant drop in the live cell count and, in turn, viral load. Even though the cell viability recovered after irradiation, the cell numbers never returned to the pre-irradiation levels. Even so, as the cells “settled down” and returned to the regulated physico-chemical conditions over time, differences between the controls and the radiation samples became apparent, as evidenced by the significant viral loads during the experimental timeline (particularly Days 12 and 15). The most significant increase in the CMV load as compared with their corresponding controls was found at Day 9 for post-proton and GCRsim irradiations, at 12 days post-iron and carbon irradiations, and at Day 15 for carbon, iron, and GCRsim. On the contrary, our previous studies showed that gamma rays were more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of lytic gene transcription of EBV. Even though EBV and CMV are both herpesviruses, their replication and response mechanisms are expected to be different. Additionally, the Akata cell line (B-cell lymphoma) and the Kasumi-3 cell line (myeloblast leukemia) are different, and it may be that the Akata cells are just a more robust cell line and can handle perturbations in the cell culture conditions more easily. Not surprisingly, then, in normal human immunology, cells of the myeloid lineage generally have a shorter lifespan and faster turnover rate (days to weeks) than cells of the lymphoid system (weeks to months) [11,12]. Future studies should limit dyshomeostasis to the cell culture system or use a more stable model (in vivo or in vitro) to confirm these results. In-depth correlation analysis of CMV genomes and transcriptomes before and after radiation exposure has the potential to identify specific loci or nucleotide changes due to radiation exposure. In the current study, viral genomic comparison of pre-radiation, Day 6, Day 12, GCRsim, and proton samples did not reveal significant differences; however, transcriptomic analysis revealed differentially expressed genes when comparing the GCRsim-Day6 cells with mock-exposed cells (Supplemental Document S2). Interestingly, only UL49 showed a significantly elevated level (LogFC 1.48, p value 0.026) in GCRsim-Day6 cells compared with mock. UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression [13]. UL49 displays leaky late expression kinetics and is localized to the nuclear replication compartments. UL49 serves as a fundamental HCMV effector that governs viral gene transcription required to complete the replication cycle. It is likely that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to over expression of UL49. Efforts to grow a UL49 virus in the laboratory were unsuccessful. The radiation track structure likely plays an important role in CMV reactivation; however, this role is not clear. In general, the viral load is the highest 3 days post-irradiation and then decreases. The decay is the fastest for low-LET gamma rays and protons and slower for high-LET carbon and iron ions. The GCRsim follows the same trend, in-between low-LET and high-LET. We have also observed similar trends in our previous study on radiation-induced EBV reactivation [9]. It is possible that for a given dose, more of the DNA of the cell is affected by low-LET than high-LET radiation, which may favor viral reactivation. High-LET radiation tends to deposit energy in a more concentrated way than low-LET radiation. That leads to more damage to DNA and other structures, or more complex DNA damage, but the cell may die when the DNA damage is too complex to repair or when there is too much damage. Indeed, the viability of cells decreases similarly for most types of radiation 3 days post-irradiation. However, the viability of cells irradiated by protons and gamma recovers more than those irradiated by carbon and iron ions. Regarding cell size, the trends are harder to put into evidence. The changes in cell size observed may be due to the cytopathic effect on replication of HCMV. The cell size decreases slightly 3 days post-irradiation for all radiation types but returns (and even surpasses) the pre-irradiation size 6 days post-irradiation. The cell size increases the most with those irradiated with carbon and iron ions, especially at high doses. The cell size of those irradiated with GCRsim is similar to that of those irradiated by high-LET radiation. To our knowledge, we have produced the only two studies that report the reactivation of herpesviruses (EBV and CMV) by spaceflight simulated radiation. However, medical research and cancer treatments have observed the reactivation of CMV by chemo- and radiotherapy for quite some time [14]. While reactivation is generally considered a by-product of reduced immune surveillance by an ablated immune system, case reports exist of radiotherapies causing suspected CMV reactivation and subsequent life-threatening pathologies [15]. The authors noted in their case report that the adverse effects (neurological deterioration) occurred during or shortly after radiation therapy and that successful administration of antiviral treatment greatly improved the surviving patients’ conditions. Additionally, CMV promoters, like IE-1, are used for innumerable studies to drive the expression of transgenes. A few studies have reported that radiation can induce activation of CMV promoters to overexpress transgenes of interest and thus enhance therapeutic delivery [16]. For example, Jung et al. in 2011 [17] found that radiation-induced expression of the CMV IEX-1 promoter (pIEX-TNF-α) increased TNF-α sensitization of cancer cells, leading to enhanced tumor regression in a xenograft model. These articles as well as our data presented here support the idea that increased radiation received through spaceflight may lead to direct reactivations of herpesviruses independent of the known mechanism of immune dysregulation.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions It is undeniable that herpesviruses reactivate from latency upon space travel. The cause of this reactivation is complicated and likely multifold. In this study on CMV (and our previous one with EBV), we show that space radiation has a direct effect on the reactivation of herpesviruses.",

Copyright notice ID: 11477029 PMID: 39408667 Abstract Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members. Keywords: cytomegalovirus, radiation, galactic cosmic radiation, spaceflight, herpes viral reactivation1. Introduction Infection by cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpesvirus family, is highly prevalent in the human population, with estimated rates of infection ranging from 50% in developed countries to 90% in developing countries [1]. Herpes viruses of this nature have co-evolved with humans [2], and even more grandly, viruses in general have recently been regarded as integral and essential to the evolution of life on Earth [3]. This symbiosis is highlighted by the fact that humans become infected for life with these viruses, and primary infections are largely asymptomatic, although some immunocompetent patients may develop infectious mononucleosis. Regardless, all patients then become latently infected, meaning that the CMV genome is present in the cell but no virus is being shed and the transcriptional activity of the virus is limited to a few genes. Stress (acute and chronic alike) and/or an immunocompromised status, such as people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or therapeutic immunosuppression, e.g., during hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT], can initiate reactivation of latent CMV, resulting in conditions including retinitis, pneumonitis, and, more rarely, hepatitis, gastrointestinal ulceration, nephritis, and pancreatitis [1]. Additionally, active CMV replication during pregnancy can lead to intrauterine infection of the fetus, with the potential for congenital CMV, the consequences of which can include microcephaly, blindness, and developmental delay [4,5]. While anti-viral agents, like ganciclovir [6], are suitable prophylactics or treatments, no “cure” for latent viral infections exists. Thus, studying the cause and effect of reactivations as well as promoting non-reactivating countermeasures is key to limiting the virus’s detrimental possibilities. Human space exploration presents a unique hostile environment difficult to replicate on Earth with hazards including microgravity, ionizing and non-ionizing cosmic radiation, physical and psychological stresses of traveling to and from space, altered diet and nutrition, continually interrupted sleep schedules, reduced protection from electromagnetic fields, and physical and social isolation. The synergistic effects of all these risks can trigger (or worsen) medical problems, potentially hindering performance during long-duration space missions [7]. Not surprisingly, these unique features of space exploration result in increased herpes viral (EBV, CMV, HSV1, and VZV) reactivation [2,8]. However, it is unclear whether these increases are due to a dysregulated immune system, one of the aforementioned features of spaceflight, or a combination with other factors. Previously, we reported that ionizing radiation (gamma, proton, carbon, and iron) increased EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation in AKATA cells latently infected with EBV [9]. In this study, we focused on the effect of space radiation to study CMV latency and reactivation, genomics, and transcriptomics. However, not only was individual ion radiation studied, but also the newly available simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The over-arching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce reactivation and specific changes in the CMV genome/transcriptome. To accomplish this goal, CMV genomes and transcriptomes were harvested from mock-exposed vs. radiation (proton, carbon, iron, gamma, and GCRsim) exposed Kasumi-3 cells latently infected with CMV and sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Irradiated cells showed reactivation of CMV based on viral loading, but genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. Transcriptomics, however, revealed significant differences in expression levels of several genes. Most importantly, UL49 was significantly (p < 0.026) upregulated with a log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48 in GCRsim-exposed Kasumi-3 cells compared with mock-exposed cells. Since UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression, it is possible that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to enhanced expression of UL49.2. Results Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 present changes in the mean of CMV viral load in copies/10,000 cells (Figure 1), cell viability in live cell percentages (Figure 2), and cell size in µm (Figure 3) of CMV-infected Kasumi-3 cells before and after irradiation with carbon, iron, gamma, proton, and GCRsim.

All bars are mean ± SEM.2.1. Viral Load Viral copy number is used to determine whether actual viral replication occurs from radiation as compared with the controls (non-irradiated cells but traveled to and from BNL with the irradiated cells). When analyzing all radiation sources together (Figure 1(A1)), 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy CMV viral loads were significantly higher (p < 0.001) as compared with controls throughout the entire experiment but also increased in the following order: control < 0.1 < 0.5 < 1.0 < 2.0. As shown in Figure 1(A1), the post-irradiation viral load in the CMV-infected Kasumi-3 cells decreased in controls as well as in all four radiation doses as compared with the pre-irradiation values (a separate set of the flasks for individual types of radiation but not irradiated). However, when the data were analyzed by timepoint (regardless of dose) (Figure 1(A2)), control and radiation both increased (non-significantly) post-radiation at Day 3 from an average of 18.27 to 23.53 and 22.21 copies/10,000 cells, respectively, and then tapered off as the experiment went on. Differences in viral load between control and radiation did not significantly occur until Day 12 (5.8 vs. 8.8 copies/10,000 cells, p < 0.001) and Day 15 (5.2 vs. 8.2 copies/10,000 cells, p < 0.01) (Figure 1(A2)). Within Day 12 and Day 15 (Figure 1(A3)), CMV viral load increased sequentially as dose increased, with all doses significantly different from control except for 0.1 Gy at Day 15. When sorting out the data from each radiation source, proton and gamma showed an increase in CMV viral load at Day 3 post-irradiation compared with the pre-irradiation samples (Figure 1(D2,E2)). All other radiation types, carbon, iron, and GCRsim, showed a decrease at Day 3 post-irradiation from their pre-irradiation levels (Figure 1(B2,C2,F2)). However, when analyzing irradiated samples by dose (Figure 1-column 1) compared with the controls, all radiation sources (except gamma) showed significant increases of CMV viral load, with the most increases seen in iron ion radiation at 2.0 Gy (+4.50 CMV copies/10,000 cells, Figure 1(C1)) and carbon 2.0 Gy (+2.87 CMV copies/10,000 cells, Figure 1(B1)). As mentioned previously, when analyzed according to different time points post-irradiation (Figure 1-column 2), the viral load increased or was roughly the same as the pre-irradiation values and then started to decrease on Days 6, 9, 12, and 15 for all the radiation sources. Significant differences compared with controls were found in proton and GCRsim at Day 9 (p < 0.001) (Figure 1(E2,F2)) and carbon and iron at Day 12 (p < 0.001) (Figure 1(B2,C2)). We also compared the results of viral load post each irradiation type and at each timepoint with their own respective controls (Figure 1-column 3). Viral load values were consistently higher post-radiation as compared with the control samples at each time point for all the experiments except for carbon and iron on Day 9 (Figure 1(B3,C3)) and gamma on Day 3 (Figure 1(D3)), which showed a decrease post-irradiation. A significant increase was observed 12 days post-irradiation for all sources as compared with their controls (Figure 1(A3)). For individual radiation types, carbon and iron showed an effect 3 days and beyond post-radiation (Figure 1(B3,C3)), while proton and GCRsim did not show any significant effect until 9 days post-irradiation (Figure 1(E3,F3)). Gamma did show an increasing trend, but this difference was not statistically significant (Figure 1(D3)).2.2. Cell Viability The cell viability was 86.3 to 89.9% before the cells were transported to NSRL (i.e., pre-irradiation values from each experiment). The trauma of transport negatively affected cell viability of Kasumi-3 cells infected with CMV, as evidenced by the substantial reduction in live cells in the control conditions (Figure 2). Radiation further significantly reduced the viability at all the dosages in an increasing order (control < 0.1 < 0.5 < 1.0 < 2.0) when compared with the controls for all sources (Figure 2(A1)). As represented in Figure 2(A2), the viability started to recover 9 days post-irradiation (controls: 70.25 ± 2.20%; radiation: 58.39 ± 2.12%) as compared with Day 3 (controls: 44.56 ± 2.57%; radiation: 41.89 ± 1.00%) and Day 6 (controls: 43.23 ± 1.86%; radiation: 39.96 ± 1.10%). The irradiated groups were significantly less viable than their corresponding controls at each timepoint (p < 0.001) except for Day 6 (Figure 2(A2)). The biggest fall was found at 2.0 Gy irradiation compared with controls at every timepoint analyzed (p < 0.001, Figure 2(A3)). When sorting out each radiation source, proton and gamma showed the least reduction in viability compared with controls (max reduction at 2.0 Gy: proton = −5.94%, Figure 2(E1), and gamma = −10.93%, Figure 2(D1)). Carbon, iron, and GCRsim (except GCRsim 0.1 Gy, Figure 2(B1,C1,F1)) all showed significant decreases in cell viability compared with controls, with the most decreases seen in iron 2.0 Gy (−26.42%) and carbon 2.0 Gy (−17.81%). Proton and gamma radiation had significant reductions in viability at Day 12 (p < 0.01, Figure 2(D2,E2)), which were driven in large part by the higher dose radiations at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy (Figure 2(D3,E3)). Gamma radiation also had a significant reduction in viability at Day 15 (p < 0.001, Figure 2(D2)). Carbon, iron, and GCRsim all had significant reductions in viability at Days 9 and 12 (Figure 2(B2,C2,F2)), with the higher doses contributing to that the most (Figure 2(B3,C3,F3)). Carbon and iron also had reductions in viability at Days 3 and 15 (Figure 2(B2,C2)).2.3. Cell Size The normal size of Kasumi-3 cells infected with CMV is around 9.0 µm. In our data set, pre-irradiation cell size ranged from 9.2 to 9.4 µm (i.e., pre-irradiation values from each experiment). Post-irradiation saw a general increase in the size of these cells as compared with their respective controls for all the sources (Figure 3(A1)). However, a significant increase was only found at 2.0 Gy irradiation dose for all the sources (9.5 ± 0.1 to 10.1 ± 0.2; p < 0.001, Figure 3(A1)), but is evident by the fact that each individual radiation source had a significant cell size increase at 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(B1–E1)). For individual sources, iron showed a significant increase at 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(C1)), carbon showed at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(B1)), gamma was significant at all doses (Figure 3(D1)), proton showed at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(E1)), and GCRsim showed at 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(F1)), respectively. It was interesting to notice that this increase was observed 9 days post-irradiation for all sources (Figure 3(A2)) and at individual sources gamma and protons (Figure 3(D2,E2)). For post-GCRsim irradiation treatment, an increase in cell size was apparent even three days after treatment for doses of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 Gy (Figure 3(E2,E3)). Similar to the other individual radiation sources, GCRsim cell sizes also increased at Day 9 (Figure 3(E2)), which coincided with a dose of 2.0 Gy having statistical significance, which continued into Day 12s and 15 (Figure 3(E3)).2.4. Genomics Kasumi cells from the above experiments were subjected to genomic analysis in order to reveal any single nucleotide polymorphisms or other possible variations in the genomes of irradiated cells compared with mock. For this purpose, total nucleic acid (TNA) was extracted from the Kasumi-3 cells from the above experiment. The recovered TNA was subjected to DNA analysis. The same TNA was also used for transcriptional analysis described below. The initial set of 22 samples (pre-radiation, D6, D12, GCR, Proton) did not reveal statistically significant genomic variants upon comparison among the groups. This finding indicates that there were no stable genomic alterations induced by irradiation during this study.2.5. Transcriptomics The TNA recovered from this study was also examined for differences in transcriptional activity of the CMV genome in the irradiated and unirradiated groups. Data from the GCR-Day 6 cells compared with mock-exposed cells indicate that differential expression seems to be occurring, but these changes do not register as statistically significant (Supplemental Document S2). However, the UL49 sequence shows a significant (p < 0.026) increase in expression reflected as log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48, summarized in Supplemental Document S1.3. Discussion Herpes viral reactivations in astronauts have generally been subclinical. However, medical events with viral etiology have occurred during spaceflight [10]. The cause of those reactivations, whether symptomatic or not, is not fully understood. Spaceflight imposes a multitude of stressors on the human body that can potentially directly (i.e., space radiation, microgravity) or indirectly (i.e., dysregulated immunity) cause the reactivation of herpes viruses. Our group has previously shown that lytic gene transcription of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), which is consistently elevated in astronaut samples, is directly activated by a variety of radiation types and doses [9]. In the current study, we examined how ionizing radiation reactivated cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the Kasumi-3 myeloblast cell line. The GCR Simulator Project at NSRL generates an accelerator-based spectrum of energies that closely approximate those that are known to make up the shielded GCR environment in space, thus providing a unique Earthbound system to test CMV reactivation in culture for spaceflight applications. In the current study, we tested the effect of carbon, iron, proton, gamma, and GCRsim individually across several doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) on CMV viral load, genomics, and transcriptomics. The CMV viral load in the infected Kasumi cells, taken as a whole, significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner, with increases seen at Day 3 at all the dosages tested, which tapered off through Day 15. However, at Days 12 and 15, the most significant viral load changes were seen at almost all doses compared with their corresponding controls. Surprisingly, however, carbon, iron, and GCRsim all had viral loads at Day 3 in controls and radiation groups that were either similar to or less than their respective pre-irradiation levels (Figure 1). Additionally, no radiation (at any dose) produced an increase in CMV at Day 3 or Day 6 compared with the control samples. In other words, if an increase in CMV viral load was seen early on for post-irradiation cells, it also occurred in the control flasks. We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the loss of cell viability resulting from cell transport from JSC to NSRL. Cells experience harsh conditions at the loading docks before and after shipping, including suboptimal temperature, humidity, and %CO2. Ideally, cell cultures would be undisturbed outside of experimental conditions, sample aliquoting, and media changes. However, with the NSRL facility located in New York, it was not feasible to do the many months-long pre-irradiation cell culture and infections outside our primary NASA facility at JSC. Based on our previous experiments using the latently infected EBV Akata cells, we did not anticipate such dampening of the experimental findings from the logistics of travel. We found that the cell viability decreased from 88.33% (before radiation) to 44.56% in controls and 41.89% in the irradiated groups (at Day 3 after radiation), accounting for a significant drop in the live cell count and, in turn, viral load. Even though the cell viability recovered after irradiation, the cell numbers never returned to the pre-irradiation levels. Even so, as the cells “settled down” and returned to the regulated physico-chemical conditions over time, differences between the controls and the radiation samples became apparent, as evidenced by the significant viral loads during the experimental timeline (particularly Days 12 and 15). The most significant increase in the CMV load as compared with their corresponding controls was found at Day 9 for post-proton and GCRsim irradiations, at 12 days post-iron and carbon irradiations, and at Day 15 for carbon, iron, and GCRsim. On the contrary, our previous studies showed that gamma rays were more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of lytic gene transcription of EBV. Even though EBV and CMV are both herpesviruses, their replication and response mechanisms are expected to be different. Additionally, the Akata cell line (B-cell lymphoma) and the Kasumi-3 cell line (myeloblast leukemia) are different, and it may be that the Akata cells are just a more robust cell line and can handle perturbations in the cell culture conditions more easily. Not surprisingly, then, in normal human immunology, cells of the myeloid lineage generally have a shorter lifespan and faster turnover rate (days to weeks) than cells of the lymphoid system (weeks to months) [11,12]. Future studies should limit dyshomeostasis to the cell culture system or use a more stable model (in vivo or in vitro) to confirm these results. In-depth correlation analysis of CMV genomes and transcriptomes before and after radiation exposure has the potential to identify specific loci or nucleotide changes due to radiation exposure. In the current study, viral genomic comparison of pre-radiation, Day 6, Day 12, GCRsim, and proton samples did not reveal significant differences; however, transcriptomic analysis revealed differentially expressed genes when comparing the GCRsim-Day6 cells with mock-exposed cells (Supplemental Document S2). Interestingly, only UL49 showed a significantly elevated level (LogFC 1.48, p value 0.026) in GCRsim-Day6 cells compared with mock. UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression [13]. UL49 displays leaky late expression kinetics and is localized to the nuclear replication compartments. UL49 serves as a fundamental HCMV effector that governs viral gene transcription required to complete the replication cycle. It is likely that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to over expression of UL49. Efforts to grow a UL49 virus in the laboratory were unsuccessful. The radiation track structure likely plays an important role in CMV reactivation; however, this role is not clear. In general, the viral load is the highest 3 days post-irradiation and then decreases. The decay is the fastest for low-LET gamma rays and protons and slower for high-LET carbon and iron ions. The GCRsim follows the same trend, in-between low-LET and high-LET. We have also observed similar trends in our previous study on radiation-induced EBV reactivation [9]. It is possible that for a given dose, more of the DNA of the cell is affected by low-LET than high-LET radiation, which may favor viral reactivation. High-LET radiation tends to deposit energy in a more concentrated way than low-LET radiation. That leads to more damage to DNA and other structures, or more complex DNA damage, but the cell may die when the DNA damage is too complex to repair or when there is too much damage. Indeed, the viability of cells decreases similarly for most types of radiation 3 days post-irradiation. However, the viability of cells irradiated by protons and gamma recovers more than those irradiated by carbon and iron ions. Regarding cell size, the trends are harder to put into evidence. The changes in cell size observed may be due to the cytopathic effect on replication of HCMV. The cell size decreases slightly 3 days post-irradiation for all radiation types but returns (and even surpasses) the pre-irradiation size 6 days post-irradiation. The cell size increases the most with those irradiated with carbon and iron ions, especially at high doses. The cell size of those irradiated with GCRsim is similar to that of those irradiated by high-LET radiation. To our knowledge, we have produced the only two studies that report the reactivation of herpesviruses (EBV and CMV) by spaceflight simulated radiation. However, medical research and cancer treatments have observed the reactivation of CMV by chemo- and radiotherapy for quite some time [14]. While reactivation is generally considered a by-product of reduced immune surveillance by an ablated immune system, case reports exist of radiotherapies causing suspected CMV reactivation and subsequent life-threatening pathologies [15]. The authors noted in their case report that the adverse effects (neurological deterioration) occurred during or shortly after radiation therapy and that successful administration of antiviral treatment greatly improved the surviving patients’ conditions. Additionally, CMV promoters, like IE-1, are used for innumerable studies to drive the expression of transgenes. A few studies have reported that radiation can induce activation of CMV promoters to overexpress transgenes of interest and thus enhance therapeutic delivery [16]. For example, Jung et al. in 2011 [17] found that radiation-induced expression of the CMV IEX-1 promoter (pIEX-TNF-α) increased TNF-α sensitization of cancer cells, leading to enhanced tumor regression in a xenograft model. These articles as well as our data presented here support the idea that increased radiation received through spaceflight may lead to direct reactivations of herpesviruses independent of the known mechanism of immune dysregulation.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture Kasumi-3 cells (hematopoietic stem cell-derived monocyte progenitor cells) (ATCC CRL-2725, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (ATCC 30-2001) with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (ATCC 30-2020), 20 U/mL penicillin, and 20 µg/mL Streptomycin. Cultures were maintained in nominal conditions at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2. To achieve the cell numbers needed for all the experimental conditions, primary frozen cell aliquots were subcultured for about 2 months prior to irradiation procedures.4.2. Experimental Conditions Kasumi-3 cells were infected with a low dose (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 1) of CMV (TB40/E strain) and allowed to establish latency (10 days of culture with monitored viral gene expression). Once CMV latency was established, 500,000 cells/mL were seeded in 25-cm2 (T-25) flasks and filled to capacity (70 mL) for transport to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Long Island, New York. Cell size, viability, and CMV viral load were determined from a pooled sample prior to transport and were regarded as pre-irradiation baselines (Day 2). Filtered flask caps were replaced with plug caps, tightened, and parafilm wrapped. Transport was overnight (≈18 h) from Johnson Space Center (JSC) to BNL. Once received at BNL, plug caps were loosened and flasks were kept upright in nominal incubator conditions overnight. The next day (irradiation day), duplicate flasks of the cells were exposed to acute doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) within each modeled radiation type (gamma, proton, carbon, iron, and GCRsim) at room temperature. Control flasks of mock-irradiated cells were also included and placed out of the incubator during radiation treatment. After irradiation, flasks were maintained in nominal incubator conditions overnight until transport back to the Johnson Space Center Immunology and Virology Laboratory (Houston, TX, USA) for analysis. Cells were then aseptically split and harvested from each flask by removing 25 mL of cells and media on Day 3 post-irradiation and then every three days following (i.e., Day 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15). Except for Day 15 (the last day), harvested cells and media were replaced with 25 mL of fresh RPMI 1640 complete media. For each harvest, cells were split into 3 subsamples and then frozen for analysis of cell count and characterization, determination of CMV viral load, and next generation sequencing.4.3. Irradiation Setup At NSRL, the cells were exposed to an acute dose of radiation (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) or sham-irradiated at room temperature. Radiation doses of 5 Gy repeatedly killed all the cells, thus were not used. Irradiations were performed using 13 s gamma rays, individual ions (150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon, and 600 MeV/n iron ions), and the simulated Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRsim) beam. The irradiation times for gamma rays are given in Table 1. The ions used for the ion irradiation are detailed in Table 2. Table 1. 137Cs gamma ray irradiation settings.

For this experiment, the simplified GCRsim was used with the same total doses (10, 50, 100, and 200 cGy). The details of the beams, energies, dose rates, and irradiation times are given in Supplemental Document S1 (file Mehta NSRL 21B GCR 5-26-21 beam records Final). At the scale of the Kasumi-3 cells, the track structures of the radiation used for this study differ greatly from one type to another. It might be useful to consider the radiation track structure to understand the differences between radiation types in viral reactivation. The simulation of an irradiated volume of 10 µm × 10 µm × 5 µm by gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, iron ions, and the simulated GCR by the Monte-Carlo simulation code RITRACKS [19] is shown in Figure 4. The details of these calculations, including the use of periodic boundary conditions, are described elsewhere [20,21]. The simulated volume is roughly the size of one Kasumi-3 cell. The dose to the volume is approximately 0.2 Gy in all cases. This dose was chosen to better illustrate the difference between the tracks of different types of radiation. In Figure 4a, electron tracks corresponding to compton and photoelectron effects are observed. In Figure 4b, 230 proton tracks are shown. The LET of the proton used for the simulation was 0.54 keV/µm. Therefore, this is often considered sparsely ionizing radiation (as opposed to high-LET radiations). However, the energy distribution and spatial configuration of the tracks are quite different for the same dose of gamma rays and protons. Tracks from higher LET ions are also shown. In Figure 4c, 14 tracks from 600 MeV/n carbon ions are shown. In Figure 4d, only one track for 600 MeV/n iron ions is sufficient to yield a dose of ~0.2 Gy to the volume. In Figure 4e, the simulation of the irradiation by the GCR field is shown. Most of the tracks are proton and helium tracks. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Simulation of the irradiation of a volume by (a) 137Cs photons, (b) 150 MeV protons, (c) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, (d) 600 MeV/n iron ions, and (e) simulated GCR mixed field. In all cases, the dosage to the irradiated volume is ~0.2 Gy.4.4. Cell Counts, Size, and Viability Aliquots from each flask were taken at each experimental day (Day 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15) and assessed for cell count (per mL), cell size (diameter in µm), and viability (percentage of live cells from total). Data were collected using a Cellometer Auto 2000 (Nexcelcom, Lawrence, MA, USA). In brief, a homogeneous sample of each cell culture flask was removed and mixed 1:1 with acridine orange and propidium iodide solution (AOPI) (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT, USA) and plated on Cellometer SD100 disposable slides for analysis [9].4.5. Determination of CMV Viral Load Frozen cells were thawed and pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. DNA was extracted from cell pellets with the Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) using the manufacturer’s instructions. Total DNA recovered from extractions was quantified by a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and Invitrogen™ Quant-iT™ Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). CMV DNA was quantified by Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) using a QuanStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Life technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). Each reaction mix (20 µL) contained 6.6 µL DNA and 13.4 µL of master mix (2X TaqMan Universal Master Mix, 830 nM IE-EX4 Forward, 830 nM IE-EX4 Reverse, 300 nM IE-EX4 Probe, 830 nM gB Forward, 830 nM gB Reverse, 300 nM gB Probe, and water). Primer and probe sequences were synthesized by IDT, Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA) and are listed in Table 3. Each sample was run in duplicate, and results were averaged. A housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was used for the qPCR assays. Viral load results (copies/µL) from the two duplicates were averaged and then normalized by the total cell count. For whole number simplification, values were multiplied by 10,000 to achieve the final variable (CMV copies/10,000 cells) used for statistical analysis and presentation in this manuscript. Table 3.

Genomics and Transcriptomics Commercial vendors were used for sequencing the genomes and RNA from exposed and control cells. Samples (cells) were shipped in frozen state on dry ice to the vendor for processing. Standard protocols for next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA and RNA were followed [22,23]. Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted from the samples and assessed for purity using fluorometric methods. The DNA, or cDNA (for transcriptomics), was used for library preparation. Nucleotides were read on an Illumina sequencer at a read length and depth that was considered appropriate for the current purpose of discovering nucleotide changes and transcript abundance. Data were analyzed on the Illumina Connected Software (https://help.connected.illumina.com/, 20 September 2024) and obtained as sequence files as well as datasheets containing relative quantities of transcripts.4.7. Statistical Method Mixed models were applied to explore how CMV load, cell size, and viability change across days and different types of radiation and doses. To account for interactions between radiation type, dose, and days, mixed models with full three-way interaction terms were constructed. Random effects of flasks nested within radiation type were incorporated to address repeated measures. Robust standard errors were used to allow for non-homogeneous variance across time. The outcomes were assumed to follow a gamma distribution. Multiple comparisons between each group and the control group were adjusted using either simulation or the Bonferroni method. The alpha level was set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the software SAS 9.4. We conducted tests based on the mixed model described above. Specifically, we first compared each dose of radiation against the control group. Then, we compared the average of all radiation groups against the control group. Finally, we compared each dose against the control at each day post-radiation.5. Conclusions It is undeniable that herpesviruses reactivate from latency upon space travel. The cause of this reactivation is complicated and likely multifold. In this study on CMV (and our previous one with EBV), we show that space radiation has a direct effect on the reactivation of herpesviruses.Acknowledgments The authors are thankful to Peter Guida and Paula Bennett from Brookhaven National Laboratory for helping with the irradiation experiments during the study under the NASA Space Radiation Program.

    "abstract": "Abstract Collection and processing of tissues to preserve space flight effects from animals after return to Earth is challenging. Specimens must be harvested with minimal time after landing to minimize postflight readaptation alterations in protein expression/translation, posttranslational modifications, and expression, as well as changes in gene expression and tissue histological degradation after euthanasia. We report the development of a widely applicable strategy for determining the window of optimal species-specific and tissue-specific posteuthanasia harvest that can be utilized to integrate into multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs. We also determined methods for ISS-compatible long-term tissue storage (10 months at −80°C) that yield recovery of high quality mRNA and protein for western analysis after sample return. Our focus was reproductive tissues. The time following euthanasia where tissues could be collected and histological integrity was maintained varied with tissue and species ranging between 1 and 3 hours. RNA quality was preserved in key reproductive tissues fixed in RNAlater up to 40 min after euthanasia. Postfixation processing was also standardized for safe shipment back to our laboratory. Our strategy can be adapted for other tissues under NASA's Biospecimen Sharing Program or similar multi-investigator tissue sharing opportunities.",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction With the current paucity of opportunities for studying whole animal mammalian physiology in space flight, the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) for postflight tissue collection offers the opportunity to broaden access to biological samples shortly after return and maximize the data generated from flight animal payloads. The logistics of space flight experiments involving live animals often requires harvesting tissues at a remote site, followed by shipping the specimens to the Principle Investigators' laboratories for detailed analysis. Furthermore, as the capabilities to house rodent and other animals on the International Space station (ISS), and to conduct long-term space flight experiments using animals are enabled, the need to harvest and fix tissues for long-term storage on ISS that will retain high quality RNA and protein for subsequent analysis in laboratories on Earth is also required. These approaches to live animal experimentation in space flight that include tissue harvest for multiple investigators require determination of (1) tissue-specific windows of time between euthanasia and tissue fixation that retain quality of histology and (2) tissue-specific windows of time for tissue fixation that retain high quality protein and RNA for subsequent analysis. Determination of these windows provides a quantitative, logical approach to generate appropriately prioritized and optimized tissue harvest and fixation logistics in a multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Program scenario, be it on Earth or during tissue harvest on the ISS. In addition, tissue storage methods should retain high sample quality under long-term storage, as samples may be harvested and stored on the ISS but may not be returned to Earth for many months, depending on ISS to Earth flight frequency and payload capacities. This issue has been addressed for preserving plant material for gene expression analysis [1], but there is no data available for animal tissues. Our participation in the BSP program involved tissue harvest from female mice at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA (KSC) for animals flown for 12–15 days in orbit on three space shuttle flights: STS-131, STS-133, and STS-135. In addition, we harvested tissues from male mice at the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IMBP) laboratory in Moscow, RU for animals flown for 30 days in orbit on the BION M1 satellite. Both the STS and BION series of flight experiments involved age- and time-matched ground control groups of animals. During the early flight planning phase of BION, there were possibilities that male or female mice would be flown and that male gerbil tissues may also be provided to the BSP. Thus, to be prepared for any of these possibilities, we undertook to determine the optimal tissue harvest windows for all of the species and reproductive tissues that we might be able to obtain. Our participation in these multi-investigator specimen sharing efforts covering four different primary flight PI experimental designs and harvest logistics necessitated a determination of the window of time between euthanasia and harvest and preservation of our tissues of interest that would allow us sufficient flexibility to obtain the highest possible quality of tissue for histopathology, RNA for gene-transcription analysis, and protein for expression and posttranslational modification analysis. A determination of these time windows is essential, since the tissues that are made available to the BSP investigators are provided after the primary flight PI's have obtained their tissues. Knowledge of the optimal windows for all of the tissues of interest aids in the preparation of targeted tissue harvest flow logistics that can provide each of the BSP team members the highest possible quality tissue, respectively. Therefore, as we report here, we developed a strategy to determine the window of time between euthanasia and fixation for retention of high quality histology for male and female reproductive organs. We also determined methods for long-term tissue storage for 10 months that provide for recovery of both high quality protein and RNA. These strategies are adaptable and can be applied to harvest and storage of other time-sensitive labile tissues from animals and plants. Furthermore, these methods can be used to optimize logistics and data collection under multi-investigator tissue harvest and sharing programs operated by any space agency, commercial entity, or flight platform.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals Approximately 8 wk old male and female C57Bl/6J (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) and ~10-month old male and female Mongolian gerbils (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were used throughout this study. All animal use protocols were approved by the University of Kansas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animals were maintained in standard cages with 12 : 12 h dark : light cycle, and standard food and water were provided ad libitum. All animals were euthanized using CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation prior to tissue harvest. 2.2. Determination of the Limit of Time and Temperature between Euthanasia and Tissue Fixation 2.2.1. Male Mice Our protocol consisted of three groups of six mice each, with one mouse for each time point. In group A, all mice were euthanized at one time and the testes and epididymides were harvested and separated and then immediately placed in Ham's F-10 medium (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) on ice. At time intervals of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 hr each testis (one mouse per time point) and epididymis (2 mice per time point) were separated and then transferred from Ham's F-10 medium to Bouin's fixative (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at room temperature (RT; 21°C). In group B, the same procedure was followed, except that the testes and epididymides, separated, were placed in Ham's F-10 medium at RT until transfer to Bouin's at the same time interval as above. In group C, all mice were euthanized at one time, the carcasses were maintained at (RT), and then at time 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 hr, the testis and epididymis were harvested from the carcasses, respectively. At each of the time points above, group C testes were placed in Bouin's solution and processed as per standard histology protocols, as detailed below. For all groups, the tissues fixed in Bouin's were processed as detailed in Section 2.3, below. At the same time point, group C epididymides were processed to obtain cauda sperm to assess sperm motility by computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) [2]. For animals used for collection of cauda epididymal sperm for motility analysis, two animals were used at each time point.2.2.2. Female Mice Female mice were euthanized (carcasses maintained at RT as per group C, above) and their ovaries and uteri were harvested at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 hr after euthanasia (one animal per time point). At the times indicated, the tissues were fixed at RT in Bouin's overnight and then processed for histology as detailed below (Section 2.3).2.2.3. Mongolian Gerbils The six male gerbils were euthanized at one time, and the carcasses were kept at room temperature. At 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 hr after euthanasia, testis and epididymis were harvested from the carcasses and separated, respectively (one animal per time point). Similarly, all six female gerbils were euthanized and the carcasses were kept at RT. Ovaries and uterine horns were harvested from each carcass at the same time interval as the males. At the times indicated above, the tissues were placed in Bouin's fixative at RT and then processed for histology, as detailed below (Section 2.3). Sperm were immediately harvested from cauda epididymis as mentioned above, and sperm motility analysis was carried out using CASA, as described above [2]. 2.3. Postharvest Processing of Mouse Testicular Tissues Testes and epididymides from the mature mice were harvested, as detailed above. Unless indicated otherwise, all procedures were done at RT. Tissues were fixed in Bouin's solution for 48 h, washed in 70% ethanol (ETOH) until the yellow color of Bouin's disappeared (~48 hr with frequent changes of 70% ETOH and gentle agitation), and divided into four groups: Control group: tissue was stored in 70% ETOH until paraffin embedding; Rapid transition: 70% ETOH was immediately replaced with PBS (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), pH 7.4 for one wk, and then rapidly replaced with 70% ETOH; Slow Re-ETOH only: 70% ETOH was immediately replaced with PBS for one wk and then sequentially replaced at 2 hr intervals with each of 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% ETOH; Slow rehydration-dehydration: 70% ETOH was sequentially (70%, 50%, 30%, 10%, then PBS, at 2 hr each) substituted with PBS for one wk and then replaced at 2 hr intervals with each of 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% ETOH. To prevent contamination, we kept tissue in PBS at 4°C, and ETOH replacement was completed at RT with 2 hr intervals between changes, as detailed above. After each of the respective final dehydration steps above, the tissues were paraffin-embedded and processed for histology and hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) using standard methods as performed previously [3]. 2.4. Total RNA Extraction and Preservation Freshly harvested mouse testes were immediately stabilized in 10 volumes of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or RNAlater solution (Ambion, Austin, TX). The samples placed in RNAlater were stored for (1) two wks at 4°C; (2) one wk at RT and one wk at 4°C; or (3) two wks at RT. Before RNA extraction, tissues were retrieved from RNAlater solution with sterile forceps and then submerged in TRIzol reagent. RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Time of placement into RNAlater was noted to determine if RNA quality was related to the duration of window from euthanasia to placement in RNAlater. RNA integrity and quantity were determined using Agilent RNA kit and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Santa Clara, CA). One μg of RNA was subjected to RT PCR with the primers specific for mouse GAPDH (Forward: 5′CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTAC; Reverse: 5′ATGACAAGCTTCCCATTCTC), and interleukin-1alpha (IL-1α) (Forward: 5′ACTTGTTTGAAGACCTAAAG; Reverse: 5′GTTTCAGAGGTTCTCAGAG). Primers were designed using online Primer Design Tool Primer 3. Uteri and ovaries from STS-135 were harvested in RNAlater solution and stored at −80°C for 10 months. Total RNA was isolated from ovaries and uterine horns with Gene Elute Mammalian RNA kit (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). PCR products were verified on 3.0% agarose gels using standard procedures. 2.5. Protein Extraction from Ovaries and Uterus Tissue Preserved in RNAlater Ovaries stabilized in RNAlater for one wk at RT and two wks at 4°C were used for protein extraction. The tissue was removed from RNAlater, briefly rinsed with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and then homogenized in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (all from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or ProteoJet Mammalian Cell Lysis Reagent (Fermentas, Pittsburgh, PA). Uteri from STS-135 mission mice were preserved in RNAlater for 10 months at −80°C, prior to processing in RIPA as described above. Protein concentration was determined using the DC Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and 15 μg protein was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions on 4–15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membranes were blocked for 1 hr with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (Tris buffered saline with Tween-20, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and probed with 1 μg/mL rabbit anti-mouse estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). To verify equal loading of proteins, membranes were stripped and reprobed with a goat anti-β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Incubations with primary antibodies were carried out overnight at 4°C. After washing in TBS-T and probing with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), bound antibodies were identified using Amersham ACL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) and luminography. Western blots were quantitated by densitometric analysis.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Effect of Delayed Processing on Quality of Mouse and Gerbil Reproductive Tissue Histology 3.1.1. Male Mouse Testes harvested any time between time 0 after euthanasia up to 2.5 hr after euthanasia showed histological properties comparable to the time 0-harvested mice. For comparative purposes, the 0 min harvested testes represent the control for subsequent time points for each storage treatment, respectively. Histological quality of the testes was excellent in all postharvest treatment procedures; namely, tissues were kept in the carcass until fixation or fixed in Bouin's immediately or stored in Hams F10 on ice or RT before fixation. Testis tubules appeared normal in all treatment groups compared to the 0 min controls, with no shrinkage of tissue and complete retention of histologic architectural details (Figures 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c)). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Effect of delayed processing on C57Bl/6J testicular morphology. Each panel represents light microscopy (40x objective) of sections of adult mouse testis stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) (magnification bar is 100 μm).

Total motility and progressive motility of cauda epididymal mouse sperm at times 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 hr were not significantly different between any of the tissue harvest time points and also not significantly different between the three tissue harvest scenarios. Table 1 shows the percent progressive motility for each time point under all three tissue storage conditions. Table 2 shows the percent total motility for each time point under all three tissue storage conditions. Based on comparable results between the three tissue harvest regimens, we focused on the “tissue in carcass” at RT regimen for subsequent experiments with female mice, as well as male and female gerbils.

Male Gerbil Testis showed normal distinct histological details with all spermatogenic cells arranged in a normal pattern in the tubule when collected up to 2.5 hr after euthanasia (Figure 2). Total motility of the gerbil cauda epididymal sperm harvested at each at time point was analyzed and is presented in Table 3. Since the data represent a single animal, statistical analysis cannot be done. Given the variation in motility with time, the data suggest that motility was relatively stable at all time points, except with perhaps a drop at 2.5 hr. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Gerbil testicular morphology (40x objective) at various time points after tissue harvest from the carcass (magnification bar is 50 μm). All gerbils were euthanized at once and tissues were harvested from the carcass at 0.5 hr interval from 0 to 2.5 hr. HE staining demonstrated the retention of histological features at every time point.Table 3.

Female Mouse The ovaries (Figure 3(a)) and uteri (Figure 3(b)) harvested from female mice up to 3 hr after euthanasia showed excellent histological properties devoid of apparent tissue degradation. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Mouse and gerbil ovarian and uterine horn histology. HE staining was used to evaluate quality of oocyte and follicles. Rows represent HE staining of: (a) mouse ovary up to 3 hr after euthanasia (4x objective, magnification bar is 500 μm); (b) mouse uteri up to 3 hr after euthanasia (10x objective, magnification bar is 500 μm); (c) gerbil ovary up to 1.5 hr after euthanasia (4x objective; magnification bar is 500 μm); (d) significantly high number of vacuoles are indicated in the yellow circles in gerbil ovaries from 1.5 h after euthanasia (40x objective, magnification bar is 100 μm); (e) gerbil uteri up to 2.5 hr after euthanasia (10x objective, magnification bar is 500 μm).3.1.4. Female Gerbil Gerbil ovaries (Figure 3(c)) harvested up to 1 hr after euthanasia showed normal healthy follicles and healthy oocytes devoid of signs of tissue degradation; however at 1.5 hr after euthanasia high numbers of unhealthy follicles and shrunken oocytes were seen, suggesting tissue deterioration due to the delay in fixation process after euthanasia. Significantly high numbers of “vacuoles-like” structures were also seen at 1.5 hr after euthanasia (Figure 3(d)), which is indicative of tissue degradation (indicated by the yellow circles). Control (0 min) gerbil ovaries had negligible “vacuoles” (indicated by two black arrows). The ovary harvested after 1.5 hr did not sustain the histological processing as they were too fragile and degraded, implying that gerbil ovaries were more sensitive and should be harvested within 1 hr of euthanasia. Uterine histology indicated tissues were intact and comparable to control at all tested time points (Figure 3(e)). 3.2. Effect of Different Postfixation Procedures on Quality of Testicular Histology Testicular and epididymis morphology was evaluated for histological changes after different postfixation processing (Figures 4 and 5). In control testicular tissue (Figure 4(a)), all types of spermatogenic cells, spermatogonia (Sp), Sertoli cells (Se), spermatocytes (Sc), and spermatids (Sd), were evident. Lymphatic spaces between seminiferous tubules and adjacent to Leydig cells (L) clusters are clearly defined. After the slow rehydration-dehydration stepwise replacement with ETOH, testis tubules appeared normal with histological architecture similar to the control group (Figure 4(b)). Although all types of spermatogenic cell were identified after slow rehydration-dehydration stepwise replacement, spermatogonia and Sertoli cell nuclei were more difficult to distinguish compared to control. The quality of testicular histology observed after slow Re-ETOH only (Figure 4(c)) was similar to that observed in the slow rehydration-dehydration stepwise replacement group. However, open spaces (black arrows) were observed within portions of seminiferous tubules in the slow Re-ETOH only group, and the seminiferous tubule basement membrane in this group often appeared wavy and thinner (yellow arrows) compared to the control (Figure 4(a)). The histologic quality was poor in the group treated by single step (rapid transition) change of solution (Figure 4(d)), as evidenced by a diffuse appearance of the tissue (not due to focus) and limited clarity of nuclear details in spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. In addition, the seminiferous tubule basement membrane was occasionally indistinct and some spermatid artifactual loss of residual bodies is also observed. Figure 4.

Open in a new tab Morphological analysis of mouse epididymis after different postfixative modifications. Sections of adult mouse epididymis were stained with HE (all at 40x; magnification bar is 50 μm). (a) Control; (b) slow rehydration-dehydration stepwise replacement of ETOH-PBS-ETOH; (c) slow Re-ETOH only replacement; (d) rapid ETOH-PBS-ETOH transition. Epithelium (E), sperm (S), basal cell (B), and principal cell (P).We found epididymal tissue to be sensitive to dehydration/rehydration shock (Figure 5). Slow rehydration-dehydration ETOH replacement had no visible negative effect on the quality of epididymal morphology (Figure 5(b)); however histological examination revealed differences in epididymal morphology after slow Re-ETOH only (Figure 5(c)) and rapid transition procedures (Figure 5(d)), compared to control (Figure 5(a)). The differences included alterations in the thickness of columnar epithelium, and basal and principal cells are not very sharp. The slow rehydration-dehydration caused less destruction of testicular and epididymal tissue than the rapid single-step changes of solution and has an overall better morphological detail preservation compared to the rapid ETOH-PBS solution change. 3.3. Total RNA and Protein Evaluation after Tissue Preservation in RNAlater under Long-Term Storage 3.3.1. RNA Stability We compared RNA integrity after preservation testicular tissue in TRIzol reagent and RNAlater (Figure 6(a)). Total RNA integrity analysis demonstrated high quality RNA after storing tissue in RNAlater for 1-2 wk at RT or 4°C compared to TRIzol preservation. Distinct 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA and absence of degraded RNA were observed on the gel. RT-PCR analysis of RNA with primers for GAPDH and IL-1α indicated high quality of expected PCR products in all analyzed samples (Figure 6(b)). Integrity analysis of total RNA isolated from STS-131 ground controls (G10, G11, and G12) and flight (F10, F11, and F12) mouse uteri after 30 to 40 min after euthanasia demonstrate high RNA quality in these samples (Figure 6(c)). We found no differences in RNA quality between all analyzed uteri and ovaries samples placed into RNAlater from 15 min to 40 min after euthanasia. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Effect of different extraction and storage methods on RNA and protein quality in ovaries, and testes extracted and/or stabilized in TRIzol or RNAlater.

Total cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western for β-actin is presented.3.3.2. Long-Term Storage for RNA Analysis Using ovary and uteri harvested from STS 135 mice, we also determined the effect of long-term (10 months) preservation in RNAlater on RNA and protein quality (Figure 7). This time frame was chosen to mimic a possible storage scenario that could occur on the ISS. Ovaries and uterus from STS-135 ground controls stabilized in RNAlater for 10 months showed excellent RNA quality (Figure 7(a)) and yield in range 6–8 μg. Figure 7.

Densitometric intensities of specific protein bands were digitally obtained and normalized to β-actin.3.3.3. Protein Stability Although not commonly done, tissue stabilized in RNAlater can be used for subsequent protein extraction. Protein obtained from samples stored in RNAlater is suitable for western blotting or 2D gel electrophoresis, but not for applications that require native protein (Ambion Guideline for RNAlater). We optimized the protocol for protein extraction from ovaries preserved in RNAlater for one wk at RT or two wks at 4°C by using RIPA buffer or ProteoJet Lysis reagent (LR). Western analysis of β-actin integrity demonstrated that one wk ambient storage of testicular tissue in RNAlater did not affect actin integrity as evidenced by the absence of proteolytic fragments and consistent signal intensity in replicate samples (Figure 6(d)).3.3.4. Long-Term Storage for Protein Analysis Protein from uteri stabilized in RNAlater for 10 months after STS-135 mission was extracted with RIPA buffer. Immunoblot for ERα and β-actin verified excellent expression levels of both proteins with no evidence of proteolytic degradation of both proteins (Figure 7(b)). Quantitative densitometry analysis of western blots indicated reduced levels ERα in mostly flight animals. These results demonstrate that RNAlater is an effective sample collection and stabilization reagent for protecting both RNA and protein under long-term conditions compatible for the ISS.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion We report here a logical method to determine the optimal time window of tissue harvest and fixation after euthanasia for use in multi-investigator tissue harvest programs that is compatible with processing of tissue sample obtained from space flight animals. We also demonstrate here a long-term storage regimen for animal tissues compatible with recovery of high quality RNA and protein under conditions similar to that on the ISS, when there may be many months between sample collection and return to Earth. The procedures set forth also include methods for tissue harvest at the site of return and for safe shipment to external laboratories for further processing for histopathology and recovery of protein and RNA. Several fixation/preservation studies have been carried out for plant samples [1, 4, 5]. One European Space Agency report included a brief discussion on fixation of mammalian cells in tissue culture for microscopy [6]. Freidin et al. [7] have demonstrated significant alterations on gene expression in lung carcinoma tissues collected about 30 minutes after harvest. Durrenberger et al. [8] reported that, in human brain samples collected from several brain banks, antemortem events appeared to negatively affect the RNA quality, but postmortem delays caused no significant deterioration. This observation supported earlier report that postmortem delay had negligible effect on RNA quality [9]. Human stomach has been described as the tissue showing the earliest sign of postmortem [10]. Presnell and Cina described stomach and pancreas as the earliest human tissues to deteriorate following death [11]. The significance of quick processing of histopathological specimen in a clinical setting has been identified by Rohr et al. [12]. However, we have not come across similar studies for animal tissues used in biomedical research. Prior to our study reported here, there was a significant knowledge gap in the literature for methods to process animal tissues compatible for multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs for space flight logistical scenarios. For our flight studies, using male and female mice on three different space shuttle flights and the BION M1 flight, it was critical to determine the optimum conditions of tissue harvest and processing for tissues of our interest, namely, testis, epididymis, ovary, and uteri. Space flight studies usually comprise remotely dispersed multi-investigator collaborations. Thus, there is a need to ship tissue samples from the site of collection at the return-to-Earth laboratory facility for initial tissue harvest to the site of final processing and detailed data collection. With respect to collection of RNA samples, TRIzol reagent gives excellent RNA integrity; however it is a phenol-based solution and tissue preserved in TRIzol cannot be shipped internationally due to airline safety restrictions. Lyophilization of fresh tissue specimen has been shown to preserve RNA and protein quality and levels by Wu et al. [13]. Though lyophilization makes shipping easier, especially across international borders, it is not a viable option for preservation of highest quality histological analysis. To obtain optimum RNA and protein quality, our results demonstrate that mouse testicular tissue can be submerged in RNAlater and stored successfully for analysis at a later time point, at least 10 months at −80°C. It should be noted that 10 months represents a minimum limit, and longer storage intervals would still need to be directly assessed. Given the current estimate for ISS SpaceX Dragon flights at approximately 3-month intervals, this would span three opportunities for sample return after an experiment is terminated and ensure maintenance of RNA and protein sample quality. It is known that, in order to isolate high quality RNA and protein from mammalian tissue, the tissue must be processed directly after harvest. We determined, for our tissues of interest, that excellent RNA stability was achieved if the tissue samples were placed into RNAlater up to 40 min after euthanasia. RNAlater is a popular reagent that inactivates all cellular enzymes, including RNAses; thus RNA expression profiles can be preserved in situations when immediate RNA isolation is not feasible. The tissue can be stored in RNAlater for a long time without nucleic acid degradation. RNAlater has been used by investigators for collection of human tissue [14] and used in RNA expression microarrays [15]. Our results indicated that RNAlater enables long-term tissue preservation for RNA and protein extraction compatible with delayed sample return from flight. This process should be evaluated for use on other tissues to maximize optimal histology and gene transcription data collection in the primary flight experiments as well as the Biospecimen Sharing Programs (BSP) investigators. Freidin et al. [7] have confirmed the significance of RNAlater as a medium to preserve gene expression of lung tissues. Tissue processing methods should be standardized for best storage and analysis of harvested tissues. Our methods for tissue fixation, long-term storage, and recovery of protein and RNA are compatible for planned in-flight tissue harvest on ISS. With regard to obtaining the best possible tissue fixation for histology collected under a multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Program, obtaining many tissues of interest to the participating investigators has to be considered in an integrated way to accommodate the scientific requirements of the overarching flight project, as well as the natural degradation process that tissues undergo as soon as euthanasia has occurred. Depending on the tissue and species, different windows of time from euthanasia to fixation may exist within which histological architecture (as well as RNA and protein integrity) is stable. In the study design reported here, we have determined the window of time and temperature for optimal postharvest maintenance of male and female tissue quality (testis, epididymis, ovary, and uterine horn) and sperm viability in mice and gerbils. These harvest protocols provide a logical method for integrating the tissue flow logistics for postflight animals for any project involving multiple investigators. Protocols compatible with investigators who require more rapid tissue retrieval can be identified and prioritized to ensure data preservation. We determined that mouse testes were able to retain excellent histological details when processed up to 3 hr after euthanasia. Sperm motility showed gradual decline with time. The authors would reiterate as mentioned in the Results section that sperm motility is a highly sensitive and variable parameter. It is normal to see major differences in motility of sperm obtained from not only one mouse to another, but also within samples obtained from the same mouse or gerbil. Nonetheless, even within the span of variability seen, our results indicate that, in case of mouse, there was no major difference in sperm motility between any of the time points, whereas in case of gerbil, we saw suggestions of a slight drop at 2.5 hr after harvest. Future studies for flight will require analysis of larger n's during definition phase, if gerbils will be used. Of the tissues studied here, Mongolian gerbil ovaries appear most sensitive to delay in processing, and require more rapid posteuthanasia processing than mouse ovaries. Determining optimum conditions for tissue handling after harvest is very crucial and can help in maximizing tissue retrieval form animal models thereby maximizing data output. Based on the time-sensitivity, investigators may be able to plan the sequence in which the tissues are harvested starting with the most sensitive tissue to least sensitive. Finally, with regard to the requirement to ship tissues fixed for histopathology, airline and ground transport providers (especially international carriers) have specific safety regulations that prohibit shipment of samples containing many widely used fixatives and preservatives of tissue histologic integrity. Science requirements may present challenges in using alternative fixatives. In this regard, Bouin's fixative (which contains picric acid) is the best fixative for the testis if the tissue is to be embedded in paraffin [16]. However, in space flight experiments, safety regulations prevent its use on flight platforms and its presence in tissue samples being shipped. Thus, we optimized protocols for fixative removal and storage of tissues in PBS for safe shipping, as well as reconstitution protocols for storing tissues in 70% ethanol to retain excellent histology.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusion Optimal time frames for harvesting testis, epididymis, ovary, and uteri without compromising the histological quality, sperm motility, and RNA quality have been determined. Differences in tissue-specific optimal fixation time windows were noted between mice and gerbils. We provide here new methods for (1) fixative removal and transfer of tissues into aqueous media for safe shipping and (2) reconstitution protocols into 70% ethanol that retains excellent histology. We conclude that stepwise replacement of ETOH-PBS-ETOH caused less degradation of histological quality of tissue than a single-step change of solution. Our results demonstrate that male and female mouse reproductive tissues stored in RNAlater solution were stable and gave high quality RNA and protein after 10 months of storage at −80°C. Thus, we have determined methods for postharvest tissue processing to replace Bouin's with 70% ethanol for safe shipping across USA and also replace 70% ethanol with PBS to enable shipping of tissues across international borders. These protocols will facilitate integration of tissue harvest logistics in multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs for optimal tissue histology and retention of high quality RNA and protein recovery from animal tissues on long-term space flight experiments on ISS as well as other flight platforms.",

Copyright notice ID: 4309301 PMID: 25654107 Abstract Collection and processing of tissues to preserve space flight effects from animals after return to Earth is challenging. Specimens must be harvested with minimal time after landing to minimize postflight readaptation alterations in protein expression/translation, posttranslational modifications, and expression, as well as changes in gene expression and tissue histological degradation after euthanasia. We report the development of a widely applicable strategy for determining the window of optimal species-specific and tissue-specific posteuthanasia harvest that can be utilized to integrate into multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs. We also determined methods for ISS-compatible long-term tissue storage (10 months at −80°C) that yield recovery of high quality mRNA and protein for western analysis after sample return. Our focus was reproductive tissues. The time following euthanasia where tissues could be collected and histological integrity was maintained varied with tissue and species ranging between 1 and 3 hours. RNA quality was preserved in key reproductive tissues fixed in RNAlater up to 40 min after euthanasia. Postfixation processing was also standardized for safe shipment back to our laboratory. Our strategy can be adapted for other tissues under NASA's Biospecimen Sharing Program or similar multi-investigator tissue sharing opportunities.1. Introduction With the current paucity of opportunities for studying whole animal mammalian physiology in space flight, the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) for postflight tissue collection offers the opportunity to broaden access to biological samples shortly after return and maximize the data generated from flight animal payloads. The logistics of space flight experiments involving live animals often requires harvesting tissues at a remote site, followed by shipping the specimens to the Principle Investigators' laboratories for detailed analysis. Furthermore, as the capabilities to house rodent and other animals on the International Space station (ISS), and to conduct long-term space flight experiments using animals are enabled, the need to harvest and fix tissues for long-term storage on ISS that will retain high quality RNA and protein for subsequent analysis in laboratories on Earth is also required. These approaches to live animal experimentation in space flight that include tissue harvest for multiple investigators require determination of (1) tissue-specific windows of time between euthanasia and tissue fixation that retain quality of histology and (2) tissue-specific windows of time for tissue fixation that retain high quality protein and RNA for subsequent analysis. Determination of these windows provides a quantitative, logical approach to generate appropriately prioritized and optimized tissue harvest and fixation logistics in a multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Program scenario, be it on Earth or during tissue harvest on the ISS. In addition, tissue storage methods should retain high sample quality under long-term storage, as samples may be harvested and stored on the ISS but may not be returned to Earth for many months, depending on ISS to Earth flight frequency and payload capacities. This issue has been addressed for preserving plant material for gene expression analysis [1], but there is no data available for animal tissues. Our participation in the BSP program involved tissue harvest from female mice at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA (KSC) for animals flown for 12–15 days in orbit on three space shuttle flights: STS-131, STS-133, and STS-135. In addition, we harvested tissues from male mice at the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IMBP) laboratory in Moscow, RU for animals flown for 30 days in orbit on the BION M1 satellite. Both the STS and BION series of flight experiments involved age- and time-matched ground control groups of animals. During the early flight planning phase of BION, there were possibilities that male or female mice would be flown and that male gerbil tissues may also be provided to the BSP. Thus, to be prepared for any of these possibilities, we undertook to determine the optimal tissue harvest windows for all of the species and reproductive tissues that we might be able to obtain. Our participation in these multi-investigator specimen sharing efforts covering four different primary flight PI experimental designs and harvest logistics necessitated a determination of the window of time between euthanasia and harvest and preservation of our tissues of interest that would allow us sufficient flexibility to obtain the highest possible quality of tissue for histopathology, RNA for gene-transcription analysis, and protein for expression and posttranslational modification analysis. A determination of these time windows is essential, since the tissues that are made available to the BSP investigators are provided after the primary flight PI's have obtained their tissues. Knowledge of the optimal windows for all of the tissues of interest aids in the preparation of targeted tissue harvest flow logistics that can provide each of the BSP team members the highest possible quality tissue, respectively. Therefore, as we report here, we developed a strategy to determine the window of time between euthanasia and fixation for retention of high quality histology for male and female reproductive organs. We also determined methods for long-term tissue storage for 10 months that provide for recovery of both high quality protein and RNA. These strategies are adaptable and can be applied to harvest and storage of other time-sensitive labile tissues from animals and plants. Furthermore, these methods can be used to optimize logistics and data collection under multi-investigator tissue harvest and sharing programs operated by any space agency, commercial entity, or flight platform.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals Approximately 8 wk old male and female C57Bl/6J (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) and ~10-month old male and female Mongolian gerbils (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were used throughout this study. All animal use protocols were approved by the University of Kansas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animals were maintained in standard cages with 12 : 12 h dark : light cycle, and standard food and water were provided ad libitum. All animals were euthanized using CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation prior to tissue harvest.2.2. Determination of the Limit of Time and Temperature between Euthanasia and Tissue Fixation 2.2.1. Male Mice Our protocol consisted of three groups of six mice each, with one mouse for each time point. In group A, all mice were euthanized at one time and the testes and epididymides were harvested and separated and then immediately placed in Ham's F-10 medium (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) on ice. At time intervals of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 hr each testis (one mouse per time point) and epididymis (2 mice per time point) were separated and then transferred from Ham's F-10 medium to Bouin's fixative (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at room temperature (RT; 21°C). In group B, the same procedure was followed, except that the testes and epididymides, separated, were placed in Ham's F-10 medium at RT until transfer to Bouin's at the same time interval as above. In group C, all mice were euthanized at one time, the carcasses were maintained at (RT), and then at time 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 hr, the testis and epididymis were harvested from the carcasses, respectively. At each of the time points above, group C testes were placed in Bouin's solution and processed as per standard histology protocols, as detailed below. For all groups, the tissues fixed in Bouin's were processed as detailed in Section 2.3, below. At the same time point, group C epididymides were processed to obtain cauda sperm to assess sperm motility by computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) [2]. For animals used for collection of cauda epididymal sperm for motility analysis, two animals were used at each time point.2.2.2. Female Mice Female mice were euthanized (carcasses maintained at RT as per group C, above) and their ovaries and uteri were harvested at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 hr after euthanasia (one animal per time point). At the times indicated, the tissues were fixed at RT in Bouin's overnight and then processed for histology as detailed below (Section 2.3).2.2.3. Mongolian Gerbils The six male gerbils were euthanized at one time, and the carcasses were kept at room temperature. At 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 hr after euthanasia, testis and epididymis were harvested from the carcasses and separated, respectively (one animal per time point). Similarly, all six female gerbils were euthanized and the carcasses were kept at RT. Ovaries and uterine horns were harvested from each carcass at the same time interval as the males. At the times indicated above, the tissues were placed in Bouin's fixative at RT and then processed for histology, as detailed below (Section 2.3). Sperm were immediately harvested from cauda epididymis as mentioned above, and sperm motility analysis was carried out using CASA, as described above [2].2.3. Postharvest Processing of Mouse Testicular Tissues Testes and epididymides from the mature mice were harvested, as detailed above. Unless indicated otherwise, all procedures were done at RT. Tissues were fixed in Bouin's solution for 48 h, washed in 70% ethanol (ETOH) until the yellow color of Bouin's disappeared (~48 hr with frequent changes of 70% ETOH and gentle agitation), and divided into four groups: Control group: tissue was stored in 70% ETOH until paraffin embedding; Rapid transition: 70% ETOH was immediately replaced with PBS (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), pH 7.4 for one wk, and then rapidly replaced with 70% ETOH; Slow Re-ETOH only: 70% ETOH was immediately replaced with PBS for one wk and then sequentially replaced at 2 hr intervals with each of 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% ETOH; Slow rehydration-dehydration: 70% ETOH was sequentially (70%, 50%, 30%, 10%, then PBS, at 2 hr each) substituted with PBS for one wk and then replaced at 2 hr intervals with each of 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% ETOH. To prevent contamination, we kept tissue in PBS at 4°C, and ETOH replacement was completed at RT with 2 hr intervals between changes, as detailed above. After each of the respective final dehydration steps above, the tissues were paraffin-embedded and processed for histology and hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) using standard methods as performed previously [3].2.4. Total RNA Extraction and Preservation Freshly harvested mouse testes were immediately stabilized in 10 volumes of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or RNAlater solution (Ambion, Austin, TX). The samples placed in RNAlater were stored for (1) two wks at 4°C; (2) one wk at RT and one wk at 4°C; or (3) two wks at RT. Before RNA extraction, tissues were retrieved from RNAlater solution with sterile forceps and then submerged in TRIzol reagent. RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Time of placement into RNAlater was noted to determine if RNA quality was related to the duration of window from euthanasia to placement in RNAlater. RNA integrity and quantity were determined using Agilent RNA kit and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Santa Clara, CA). One μg of RNA was subjected to RT PCR with the primers specific for mouse GAPDH (Forward: 5′CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTAC; Reverse: 5′ATGACAAGCTTCCCATTCTC), and interleukin-1alpha (IL-1α) (Forward: 5′ACTTGTTTGAAGACCTAAAG; Reverse: 5′GTTTCAGAGGTTCTCAGAG). Primers were designed using online Primer Design Tool Primer 3. Uteri and ovaries from STS-135 were harvested in RNAlater solution and stored at −80°C for 10 months. Total RNA was isolated from ovaries and uterine horns with Gene Elute Mammalian RNA kit (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). PCR products were verified on 3.0% agarose gels using standard procedures.2.5. Protein Extraction from Ovaries and Uterus Tissue Preserved in RNAlater Ovaries stabilized in RNAlater for one wk at RT and two wks at 4°C were used for protein extraction. The tissue was removed from RNAlater, briefly rinsed with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and then homogenized in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (all from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or ProteoJet Mammalian Cell Lysis Reagent (Fermentas, Pittsburgh, PA). Uteri from STS-135 mission mice were preserved in RNAlater for 10 months at −80°C, prior to processing in RIPA as described above. Protein concentration was determined using the DC Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and 15 μg protein was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions on 4–15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membranes were blocked for 1 hr with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (Tris buffered saline with Tween-20, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and probed with 1 μg/mL rabbit anti-mouse estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). To verify equal loading of proteins, membranes were stripped and reprobed with a goat anti-β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Incubations with primary antibodies were carried out overnight at 4°C. After washing in TBS-T and probing with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), bound antibodies were identified using Amersham ACL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) and luminography. Western blots were quantitated by densitometric analysis.3. Results 3.1. Effect of Delayed Processing on Quality of Mouse and Gerbil Reproductive Tissue Histology 3.1.1. Male Mouse Testes harvested any time between time 0 after euthanasia up to 2.5 hr after euthanasia showed histological properties comparable to the time 0-harvested mice. For comparative purposes, the 0 min harvested testes represent the control for subsequent time points for each storage treatment, respectively. Histological quality of the testes was excellent in all postharvest treatment procedures; namely, tissues were kept in the carcass until fixation or fixed in Bouin's immediately or stored in Hams F10 on ice or RT before fixation. Testis tubules appeared normal in all treatment groups compared to the 0 min controls, with no shrinkage of tissue and complete retention of histologic architectural details (Figures 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c)). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Effect of delayed processing on C57Bl/6J testicular morphology. Each panel represents light microscopy (40x objective) of sections of adult mouse testis stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) (magnification bar is 100 μm).

Total motility and progressive motility of cauda epididymal mouse sperm at times 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 hr were not significantly different between any of the tissue harvest time points and also not significantly different between the three tissue harvest scenarios. Table 1 shows the percent progressive motility for each time point under all three tissue storage conditions. Table 2 shows the percent total motility for each time point under all three tissue storage conditions. Based on comparable results between the three tissue harvest regimens, we focused on the “tissue in carcass” at RT regimen for subsequent experiments with female mice, as well as male and female gerbils.

Male Gerbil Testis showed normal distinct histological details with all spermatogenic cells arranged in a normal pattern in the tubule when collected up to 2.5 hr after euthanasia (Figure 2). Total motility of the gerbil cauda epididymal sperm harvested at each at time point was analyzed and is presented in Table 3. Since the data represent a single animal, statistical analysis cannot be done. Given the variation in motility with time, the data suggest that motility was relatively stable at all time points, except with perhaps a drop at 2.5 hr. Figure 2.

Female Mouse The ovaries (Figure 3(a)) and uteri (Figure 3(b)) harvested from female mice up to 3 hr after euthanasia showed excellent histological properties devoid of apparent tissue degradation. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Mouse and gerbil ovarian and uterine horn histology. HE staining was used to evaluate quality of oocyte and follicles. Rows represent HE staining of: (a) mouse ovary up to 3 hr after euthanasia (4x objective, magnification bar is 500 μm); (b) mouse uteri up to 3 hr after euthanasia (10x objective, magnification bar is 500 μm); (c) gerbil ovary up to 1.5 hr after euthanasia (4x objective; magnification bar is 500 μm); (d) significantly high number of vacuoles are indicated in the yellow circles in gerbil ovaries from 1.5 h after euthanasia (40x objective, magnification bar is 100 μm); (e) gerbil uteri up to 2.5 hr after euthanasia (10x objective, magnification bar is 500 μm).3.1.4. Female Gerbil Gerbil ovaries (Figure 3(c)) harvested up to 1 hr after euthanasia showed normal healthy follicles and healthy oocytes devoid of signs of tissue degradation; however at 1.5 hr after euthanasia high numbers of unhealthy follicles and shrunken oocytes were seen, suggesting tissue deterioration due to the delay in fixation process after euthanasia. Significantly high numbers of “vacuoles-like” structures were also seen at 1.5 hr after euthanasia (Figure 3(d)), which is indicative of tissue degradation (indicated by the yellow circles). Control (0 min) gerbil ovaries had negligible “vacuoles” (indicated by two black arrows). The ovary harvested after 1.5 hr did not sustain the histological processing as they were too fragile and degraded, implying that gerbil ovaries were more sensitive and should be harvested within 1 hr of euthanasia. Uterine histology indicated tissues were intact and comparable to control at all tested time points (Figure 3(e)).3.2. Effect of Different Postfixation Procedures on Quality of Testicular Histology Testicular and epididymis morphology was evaluated for histological changes after different postfixation processing (Figures 4 and 5). In control testicular tissue (Figure 4(a)), all types of spermatogenic cells, spermatogonia (Sp), Sertoli cells (Se), spermatocytes (Sc), and spermatids (Sd), were evident. Lymphatic spaces between seminiferous tubules and adjacent to Leydig cells (L) clusters are clearly defined. After the slow rehydration-dehydration stepwise replacement with ETOH, testis tubules appeared normal with histological architecture similar to the control group (Figure 4(b)). Although all types of spermatogenic cell were identified after slow rehydration-dehydration stepwise replacement, spermatogonia and Sertoli cell nuclei were more difficult to distinguish compared to control. The quality of testicular histology observed after slow Re-ETOH only (Figure 4(c)) was similar to that observed in the slow rehydration-dehydration stepwise replacement group. However, open spaces (black arrows) were observed within portions of seminiferous tubules in the slow Re-ETOH only group, and the seminiferous tubule basement membrane in this group often appeared wavy and thinner (yellow arrows) compared to the control (Figure 4(a)). The histologic quality was poor in the group treated by single step (rapid transition) change of solution (Figure 4(d)), as evidenced by a diffuse appearance of the tissue (not due to focus) and limited clarity of nuclear details in spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. In addition, the seminiferous tubule basement membrane was occasionally indistinct and some spermatid artifactual loss of residual bodies is also observed. Figure 4.

Sections of adult mouse epididymis were stained with HE (all at 40x; magnification bar is 50 μm). (a) Control; (b) slow rehydration-dehydration stepwise replacement of ETOH-PBS-ETOH; (c) slow Re-ETOH only replacement; (d) rapid ETOH-PBS-ETOH transition. Epithelium (E), sperm (S), basal cell (B), and principal cell (P).We found epididymal tissue to be sensitive to dehydration/rehydration shock (Figure 5). Slow rehydration-dehydration ETOH replacement had no visible negative effect on the quality of epididymal morphology (Figure 5(b)); however histological examination revealed differences in epididymal morphology after slow Re-ETOH only (Figure 5(c)) and rapid transition procedures (Figure 5(d)), compared to control (Figure 5(a)). The differences included alterations in the thickness of columnar epithelium, and basal and principal cells are not very sharp. The slow rehydration-dehydration caused less destruction of testicular and epididymal tissue than the rapid single-step changes of solution and has an overall better morphological detail preservation compared to the rapid ETOH-PBS solution change.3.3. Total RNA and Protein Evaluation after Tissue Preservation in RNAlater under Long-Term Storage 3.3.1. RNA Stability We compared RNA integrity after preservation testicular tissue in TRIzol reagent and RNAlater (Figure 6(a)). Total RNA integrity analysis demonstrated high quality RNA after storing tissue in RNAlater for 1-2 wk at RT or 4°C compared to TRIzol preservation. Distinct 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA and absence of degraded RNA were observed on the gel. RT-PCR analysis of RNA with primers for GAPDH and IL-1α indicated high quality of expected PCR products in all analyzed samples (Figure 6(b)). Integrity analysis of total RNA isolated from STS-131 ground controls (G10, G11, and G12) and flight (F10, F11, and F12) mouse uteri after 30 to 40 min after euthanasia demonstrate high RNA quality in these samples (Figure 6(c)). We found no differences in RNA quality between all analyzed uteri and ovaries samples placed into RNAlater from 15 min to 40 min after euthanasia. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Effect of different extraction and storage methods on RNA and protein quality in ovaries, and testes extracted and/or stabilized in TRIzol or RNAlater. (a) Total RNA integrity analysis. Total RNA was isolated from mouse testis and stabilized in TRIzol reagent (RNA yield and quality control (lane 1); RNAlater for 2 wks at 4°C (lane 2); RNAlater for 1 wk at room temperature and 1 wk at 4°C (lane 3); RNAlater for 2 wks at RT (lane 4). (b) Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products with primers for IL-1α and GAPDH. For RT PCR total RNA was used after stabilization in TRIzol reagent (lane 1); RNAlater for 2 wks at 4°C (lane 2); RNAlater for 1 wk at RT and 1 wk at 4°C (lane 3); RNAlater for 2 wks at RT (lane 4). (c) Total RNA integrity analysis STS-131 ground (G10, G11, and G12) and flight (F10, F11, and F12) uteri fixed in RNAlater after 30–40 min after euthanasia. (d) Comparison of buffers to remove RNAlater for subsequent western analysis of β-actin integrity in ovaries. Mouse ovaries were stored at RNAlater for 1 wk at RT or 2 wk at 4°C; tissues were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (lanes 1, 2) or ProteoJET Lysis reagent (LR) (lanes 3, 4). Total cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western for β-actin is presented.3.3.2. Long-Term Storage for RNA Analysis Using ovary and uteri harvested from STS 135 mice, we also determined the effect of long-term (10 months) preservation in RNAlater on RNA and protein quality (Figure 7). This time frame was chosen to mimic a possible storage scenario that could occur on the ISS. Ovaries and uterus from STS-135 ground controls stabilized in RNAlater for 10 months showed excellent RNA quality (Figure 7(a)) and yield in range 6–8 μg. Figure 7. Open in a new tab RNA and protein quality of STS-135 uteri and ovaries stabilized in RNAlater for 10 months at −80°C. (a) STS-135 ground control (G16–G26) ovarian and uterine RNA integrity analysis.

Western blot analysis was performed using the corresponding antibodies to check expression levels of the proteins. Representative Immunoblot (top) and its graphical presentation (bottom). Densitometric intensities of specific protein bands were digitally obtained and normalized to β-actin.3.3.3. Protein Stability Although not commonly done, tissue stabilized in RNAlater can be used for subsequent protein extraction. Protein obtained from samples stored in RNAlater is suitable for western blotting or 2D gel electrophoresis, but not for applications that require native protein (Ambion Guideline for RNAlater). We optimized the protocol for protein extraction from ovaries preserved in RNAlater for one wk at RT or two wks at 4°C by using RIPA buffer or ProteoJet Lysis reagent (LR). Western analysis of β-actin integrity demonstrated that one wk ambient storage of testicular tissue in RNAlater did not affect actin integrity as evidenced by the absence of proteolytic fragments and consistent signal intensity in replicate samples (Figure 6(d)).3.3.4. Long-Term Storage for Protein Analysis Protein from uteri stabilized in RNAlater for 10 months after STS-135 mission was extracted with RIPA buffer. Immunoblot for ERα and β-actin verified excellent expression levels of both proteins with no evidence of proteolytic degradation of both proteins (Figure 7(b)). Quantitative densitometry analysis of western blots indicated reduced levels ERα in mostly flight animals. These results demonstrate that RNAlater is an effective sample collection and stabilization reagent for protecting both RNA and protein under long-term conditions compatible for the ISS.4. Discussion We report here a logical method to determine the optimal time window of tissue harvest and fixation after euthanasia for use in multi-investigator tissue harvest programs that is compatible with processing of tissue sample obtained from space flight animals. We also demonstrate here a long-term storage regimen for animal tissues compatible with recovery of high quality RNA and protein under conditions similar to that on the ISS, when there may be many months between sample collection and return to Earth. The procedures set forth also include methods for tissue harvest at the site of return and for safe shipment to external laboratories for further processing for histopathology and recovery of protein and RNA. Several fixation/preservation studies have been carried out for plant samples [1, 4, 5]. One European Space Agency report included a brief discussion on fixation of mammalian cells in tissue culture for microscopy [6]. Freidin et al. [7] have demonstrated significant alterations on gene expression in lung carcinoma tissues collected about 30 minutes after harvest. Durrenberger et al. [8] reported that, in human brain samples collected from several brain banks, antemortem events appeared to negatively affect the RNA quality, but postmortem delays caused no significant deterioration. This observation supported earlier report that postmortem delay had negligible effect on RNA quality [9]. Human stomach has been described as the tissue showing the earliest sign of postmortem [10]. Presnell and Cina described stomach and pancreas as the earliest human tissues to deteriorate following death [11]. The significance of quick processing of histopathological specimen in a clinical setting has been identified by Rohr et al. [12]. However, we have not come across similar studies for animal tissues used in biomedical research. Prior to our study reported here, there was a significant knowledge gap in the literature for methods to process animal tissues compatible for multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs for space flight logistical scenarios. For our flight studies, using male and female mice on three different space shuttle flights and the BION M1 flight, it was critical to determine the optimum conditions of tissue harvest and processing for tissues of our interest, namely, testis, epididymis, ovary, and uteri. Space flight studies usually comprise remotely dispersed multi-investigator collaborations. Thus, there is a need to ship tissue samples from the site of collection at the return-to-Earth laboratory facility for initial tissue harvest to the site of final processing and detailed data collection. With respect to collection of RNA samples, TRIzol reagent gives excellent RNA integrity; however it is a phenol-based solution and tissue preserved in TRIzol cannot be shipped internationally due to airline safety restrictions. Lyophilization of fresh tissue specimen has been shown to preserve RNA and protein quality and levels by Wu et al. [13]. Though lyophilization makes shipping easier, especially across international borders, it is not a viable option for preservation of highest quality histological analysis. To obtain optimum RNA and protein quality, our results demonstrate that mouse testicular tissue can be submerged in RNAlater and stored successfully for analysis at a later time point, at least 10 months at −80°C. It should be noted that 10 months represents a minimum limit, and longer storage intervals would still need to be directly assessed. Given the current estimate for ISS SpaceX Dragon flights at approximately 3-month intervals, this would span three opportunities for sample return after an experiment is terminated and ensure maintenance of RNA and protein sample quality. It is known that, in order to isolate high quality RNA and protein from mammalian tissue, the tissue must be processed directly after harvest. We determined, for our tissues of interest, that excellent RNA stability was achieved if the tissue samples were placed into RNAlater up to 40 min after euthanasia. RNAlater is a popular reagent that inactivates all cellular enzymes, including RNAses; thus RNA expression profiles can be preserved in situations when immediate RNA isolation is not feasible. The tissue can be stored in RNAlater for a long time without nucleic acid degradation. RNAlater has been used by investigators for collection of human tissue [14] and used in RNA expression microarrays [15]. Our results indicated that RNAlater enables long-term tissue preservation for RNA and protein extraction compatible with delayed sample return from flight. This process should be evaluated for use on other tissues to maximize optimal histology and gene transcription data collection in the primary flight experiments as well as the Biospecimen Sharing Programs (BSP) investigators. Freidin et al. [7] have confirmed the significance of RNAlater as a medium to preserve gene expression of lung tissues. Tissue processing methods should be standardized for best storage and analysis of harvested tissues. Our methods for tissue fixation, long-term storage, and recovery of protein and RNA are compatible for planned in-flight tissue harvest on ISS. With regard to obtaining the best possible tissue fixation for histology collected under a multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Program, obtaining many tissues of interest to the participating investigators has to be considered in an integrated way to accommodate the scientific requirements of the overarching flight project, as well as the natural degradation process that tissues undergo as soon as euthanasia has occurred. Depending on the tissue and species, different windows of time from euthanasia to fixation may exist within which histological architecture (as well as RNA and protein integrity) is stable. In the study design reported here, we have determined the window of time and temperature for optimal postharvest maintenance of male and female tissue quality (testis, epididymis, ovary, and uterine horn) and sperm viability in mice and gerbils. These harvest protocols provide a logical method for integrating the tissue flow logistics for postflight animals for any project involving multiple investigators. Protocols compatible with investigators who require more rapid tissue retrieval can be identified and prioritized to ensure data preservation. We determined that mouse testes were able to retain excellent histological details when processed up to 3 hr after euthanasia. Sperm motility showed gradual decline with time. The authors would reiterate as mentioned in the Results section that sperm motility is a highly sensitive and variable parameter. It is normal to see major differences in motility of sperm obtained from not only one mouse to another, but also within samples obtained from the same mouse or gerbil. Nonetheless, even within the span of variability seen, our results indicate that, in case of mouse, there was no major difference in sperm motility between any of the time points, whereas in case of gerbil, we saw suggestions of a slight drop at 2.5 hr after harvest. Future studies for flight will require analysis of larger n's during definition phase, if gerbils will be used. Of the tissues studied here, Mongolian gerbil ovaries appear most sensitive to delay in processing, and require more rapid posteuthanasia processing than mouse ovaries. Determining optimum conditions for tissue handling after harvest is very crucial and can help in maximizing tissue retrieval form animal models thereby maximizing data output. Based on the time-sensitivity, investigators may be able to plan the sequence in which the tissues are harvested starting with the most sensitive tissue to least sensitive. Finally, with regard to the requirement to ship tissues fixed for histopathology, airline and ground transport providers (especially international carriers) have specific safety regulations that prohibit shipment of samples containing many widely used fixatives and preservatives of tissue histologic integrity. Science requirements may present challenges in using alternative fixatives. In this regard, Bouin's fixative (which contains picric acid) is the best fixative for the testis if the tissue is to be embedded in paraffin [16]. However, in space flight experiments, safety regulations prevent its use on flight platforms and its presence in tissue samples being shipped. Thus, we optimized protocols for fixative removal and storage of tissues in PBS for safe shipping, as well as reconstitution protocols for storing tissues in 70% ethanol to retain excellent histology.5. Conclusion Optimal time frames for harvesting testis, epididymis, ovary, and uteri without compromising the histological quality, sperm motility, and RNA quality have been determined. Differences in tissue-specific optimal fixation time windows were noted between mice and gerbils. We provide here new methods for (1) fixative removal and transfer of tissues into aqueous media for safe shipping and (2) reconstitution protocols into 70% ethanol that retains excellent histology. We conclude that stepwise replacement of ETOH-PBS-ETOH caused less degradation of histological quality of tissue than a single-step change of solution. Our results demonstrate that male and female mouse reproductive tissues stored in RNAlater solution were stable and gave high quality RNA and protein after 10 months of storage at −80°C. Thus, we have determined methods for postharvest tissue processing to replace Bouin's with 70% ethanol for safe shipping across USA and also replace 70% ethanol with PBS to enable shipping of tissues across international borders. These protocols will facilitate integration of tissue harvest logistics in multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs for optimal tissue histology and retention of high quality RNA and protein recovery from animal tissues on long-term space flight experiments on ISS as well as other flight platforms.Acknowledgments This study is supported by NASA Grant NNX09AP04G to Joseph S.
