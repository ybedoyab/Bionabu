    "abstract": "Abstract Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans. Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.

    "introduction": "Introduction We have entered an era in which living and working in space is a reality. Studies show that spaceflight has health risks such as central nervous system and cardiovascular dysfunction, cancer risk, immune dysregulation, muscle and bone loss, and fatty liver1. At the molecular level, risks include oxidative stress, DNA damage, cosmic radiation exposure, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome shift, and epigenetic alterations1. Of these, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been identified as major space-related risks2. Mitochondria are not only the powerhouse of the cell but also the center of many metabolic pathways. Insulin is a highly conserved anabolic and mitogenic peptide hormone that acts as a master regulator of energy metabolism across species, including humans3. It is secreted by the pancreas in response to increased plasma glucose, and exerts its effects on most organs including the kidney and liver as well as skeletal muscle, and bone4. Insulin receptor is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)5 and undergoes autophosphorylation upon activation, leading to a downstream signaling cascade which influences cellular function, particularly glucose metabolism. Insulin resistance (IR) arises when these downstream molecular pathways do not respond appropriately in target tissues, thus impeding the physiologic response to insulin. In the physiological state, IR can also be observed due to opposing actions from counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, glucocorticoids, and catecholamines. Insulin resistance is further associated with metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, lipid dysfunction, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Each of these factors is also interconnected, thus resulting in a potentially vicious cycle. The presence of insulin resistance during spaceflight has been reported, and sex differences play a role, with female astronauts displaying better Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) values than male astronauts6,7. Sex differences play a role in diseases and metabolism both on Earth and in space8. Some of these differences may be attributed to sex hormones. Estrogens play a variety of roles and serve many functions in women’s lives. Besides being a reproductive hormone, estrogen is involved in metabolism as well as in the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems9. Estrogen signaling activates membrane and nuclear receptors in both canonical and non-canonical ways to modulate metabolism, and promote growth, proliferation, and differentiation of diverse cell types10,11. Estrogen receptors are ESR1, estrogen receptor beta (ESR2), and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1). There are also estrogen-related receptors alpha, beta and gamma (ESRRA, ESRRB, ESRRG) which are structurally similar to ESR1 and ESR212 but whose ligands are unknown. ESRRA also has DNA sequence homology to the estrogen receptor and can be activated by phytoestrogens (i.e. genistein)13. These receptors play pivotal roles in metabolism, insulin resistance, NAFLD, and mitochondrial function12. Besides that, an unbalanced ratio of these receptors may have an impact on metabolism14. Additionally, estrogen and insulin combine in controlling metabolic pathways. In animal models, knockout of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (ESR1) in both male and female mice results in insulin resistance and dysglycemia15–17. Estrogen receptors promote pancreatic cell survival, enhance insulin production, and improve insulin sensitivity18,19. Female and male ESR1−/− mice both display reduced GLUT4 expression, further emphasizing the role of estrogen in glycemic control14. Clinically, compared to premenopausal women, postmenopausal women have an increased risk of adverse metabolic profiles such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, impaired glucose and lipid profiles, increased android fat deposition, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis20. Estrogens also positively correlate with bone and muscle mass and are protective against disuse atrophy21. Thus, there is substantial reason to believe that insulin and estrogen signaling are key pathways regulating health in space. The amount of knowledge in the literature about how insulin and estrogen signaling and related pathways change during spaceflight is currently sparse. Our preliminary findings reported possible insulin and estrogen signaling alteration during spaceflight22,23. A few published studies show insulin resistance parameters may change during spaceflight but data are conflicting, suggesting either decreased insulin or no change24,25. Similarly, data on estrogen signaling are conflicting with one study revealing downregulation of ESR1 and ESR2 in the uterus26 whereas a recent study found no alterations in estrogen receptor expression in rodent ovaries27. To address these gaps in our knowledge of insulin and estrogen signaling in response to spaceflight we examined these signaling pathways across multiple tissues in rodents from the same mission as well as in a group of astronauts and a set of commercial spaceflight participants/astronauts. Our results indicate significant changes in these pathways in response to spaceflight in both mice and people. These observations lay the foundation for further studies aimed at understanding the metabolic alterations induced by spaceflight as well as highlighting insulin and estrogen signaling as potential targets for countermeasures in future spaceflight missions.",
    "methods": "Methods Animal and sample collection All omics data related to mouse samples were obtained from NASA’s GeneLab public omics repository86. The data derived from spaceflight experiments carried out onboard the ISS as part of the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1), RR-5, RR-7, and MHU-2 missions. A description of the experimental design, the corresponding type of tissues, and the data accessed are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. All previous animal experiments and methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines at each principal investigators’ institutions and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use committee (IACUC). A detailed description of the methodology for obtaining tissue samples and processing is available in NASA’s GeneLab platform. For the RR-1 mission, in summary, forty female 12-week-old C57Bl/6 J (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) were selected based on similar body weights for 4 experimental groups (16-week-old at launch, n = 10/group): baseline control, vivarium control, habitat control, and flight. Flight mice were launched onboard the ISS on 21 September 2014. Relevant to this study, the habitat control was placed in the ISS Environmental Simulator at NASA KSC on a 4-day delay to mimic flight temperature, CO2, and humidity conditions on the ISS for the duration of spaceflight. Flight mice were exposed to microgravity for a total of 37 days (33 days on ISS and 4 days in the Dragon Capsule). Mice were euthanized by injection of Euthasol followed by cervical dislocation and immediately fast frozen intact or partially dissected prior to carcasses being frozen in the Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) aboard the ISS. All ground mice were processed similarly. Flight mice carcasses returned to Earth February 2015 and were then maintained along with the control mice frozen at the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) at the Ames Research Center until dissection66. Samples were collected and processed as previously described27,68. Mouse carcasses were removed from −80 °C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15–20 min. Multiple tissues were collected from each carcass. This study was based on the following tissue types, the Adrenal glands (OSD-98), Extensor digitorum longus muscle (OSD-99), Eye (OSD-100), Gastrocnemius muscle (OSD-101), Kidney (OSD-102), Quadriceps Muscle (OSD-103), Soleus muscle (OSD-104), Tibialis anterior muscle (OSD-105), and Liver (OSD-168, OSD-48). RNA sequencing and analysis Protocol for each dataset is available on the GeneLab platform (Table S1). Data validation and quality control was performed with FASTQC and Trim Galore! read alignment to the mouse genome using STAR RNA-seq aligner generation of gene-level expected count data with RSEM87. UpSet plots were generated using the UpSetR package in R. The UpSet plot bars were sorted from the largest number of genes to the smallest number of genes in each intersection set with each set having ≥ 2 genes. Heat maps were created using packages available through R (pheatmap and complexheatmap). Hierarchical clustering was used for the heatmaps where Euclidean distance was used as a distance measure and the complete linkage method was used to find similar clusters. For the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) Pathway Analysis, the Genelab datasets are re-analyzed to produce the t-score. The Differential Expression (DE) analysis is accomplished using DESeq2 version 1.26.088, in R software version 4.1.2. Expected counts from the RSEM step were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. The ensembl IDs of the genes in the DE datasets were annotated to their corresponding gene symbols using the R package biomaRt89,90. The murine skin datasets were analyzed via a similar pipeline available at https://github.com/henrycope/spaceflight-skin-transcriptomics-insulin-estrogen, using R version 4.1.0, DESeq2 version 1.32, and biomaRt version 2.48.3. We performed GSEA on the differentially expressed datasets using fGSEA91 to determine to what extent insulin and estrogen pathways were impacted in spaceflight. Estrogen- and insulin- specific gene pathways were selected using the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)91,92. The latest version MSigDB v2022.1 was used in the pathway search. The keyword “estrogen” was used to identify the estrogen-specific pathways through all database collections and all contributors within the Mus musculus species. Similarly, the keyword “insulin” was used to identify insulin-specific pathways through all contributors and Mus musculus database collections. The outcome of the fGSEA analysis is the normalized enrichment score (NES) of any given pathway, alongside valuable information on the analysis, such as the adjusted p-value, and the leading-edge genes of the pathway. The NES is the enrichment score normalized based on the number of genes in the gene set. It indicates the representation of the pathway genes in the dataset gene list, which is priorly ranked according to the values of the t-score of the genes. A positive NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the top of the gene list, while a negative NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the bottom of the gene list. The plots of normalized enrichment score (NES) of the different pathways for a given dataset are rendered using ggplot293, and the heatmaps across different datasets or different genes are rendered using the ComplexHeatmap R package. We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems) for canonical pathway analysis and subsequent predictions in each tissue with statistically significant genes with a fold-change ≥ 1.2 (and ≤ −1.2) comparing flight conditions versus habitat ground controls (FDR < 0.05 as stated above). Low fold-change has become quite standard when trying to identify genes that are differentially expressed, as low cutoffs are less affected by different data normalization schemes and they are less likely to eliminate key genes operating under very tight level regulation61. IPA was used to predict statistically significant activation or inhibition of canonical pathways using activation Z-score statistics (≥2, activated or ≤−2, inhibited)94. Cell-Free Epigenome JAXA Study plasma cfRNA data Aggregated normalized RNA expression values were shared through NASA’s GeneLab platform with accession number: OSD-53051. Blood samples were collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. cfRNA samples were obtained by purifying total RNA from plasma samples and analyzed by RNA-seq. Mean expression values from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts were used for the analysis in this report. Heatmaps were made for the specific genes on the normalized values per time point using R package pheatmap version 1.0.12. Inspiration 4 (i4) astronaut sample collection Inspiration4 was the world’s first all-civilian mission to orbit Earth. Four civilians, two males and two females, spent three days in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) at 585 km above Earth. The mission launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center on 15 September 2021 and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral on September 18th, 2021. Several human-related experiments were carried out to study the effects of spaceflight on human health and performance in collaboration with SpaceX, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), and Weill Cornell Medicine. The experiments carried out on the Inspiration4 crew-members were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines at the principal investigators’ institutions. Moreover, the different study designs and the corresponding methods to collect and analyze the biological samples were approved by BCM IRB. All biological data derived from the Inspiration4 mission were collected pre and post flights. For this study, only data from blood samples and skin biopsies were used. Pre-flight samples were collected at L-92, L-44, and L-3 days prior to launch to space. Upon return, post-flight samples were collected at R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 days. i4 PBMC Single-cell sequencing and analysis Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC ref. 95. ssGSEA was used to calculate the pathway scores of Insulin Resistance, Estrogen Signaling, Insulin Signaling. Heatmaps are generated by the pheatmap R package. Skin spatial transcriptomics For skin spatial transcriptomics data, 4 mm diameter skin biopsies were obtained from all Inspiration4 crew members, once before flight and as soon as possible after return (L-44 and R + 1). These biopsies were flash frozen and processed with the NanoString GeoMx platform. A 20x scan was used to select 95 freeform regions of interest (ROIs) to guide selection of regions of interest. From immunofluorescence staining, we identified epidermis, dermis (OD), and vasculatures (VA); we subdivided epidermis into outer and inner layers, which corresponded to granular and spinous layer for outer epidermal (OE), and basal layer for inner epidermal (IE). GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI and converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the Q3 normalized count matrix that accounts for factors such as capture area, cellularity, and read quality, the DESeq2 method was used to perform differential expression analysis. Proteomics sample preparation and data processing The specific details of the proteomics method was previously published and can be found on GeneLab’s platform. In brief, after protein homogenization, solubilization, and hydrolysis, resulting peptides were dried and labeled using TMT isobaric tags. The labeled peptides were analyzed on the Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Fusion MS instrument was operated in positive ion data-dependent mode with synchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS3 analysis for reporter ion quantitation. Peptide and protein identification and quantification was performed with MaxQuant (1.6.2.3) using a mouse reference database from Uniprot. Protein groups containing matches to decoys or contaminants were discarded. Subsequently, Internal Reference Scaling (IRS) method was employed to normalize protein intensities between different TMT experiments using common proteins in pooled internal standards. The data was log2 transformed and scaled by subtracting the median for each sample. Limma was employed to determine differentially protein abundance between the flight group versus the ground control. All data was plotted as heatmaps using pheatmap (ver.1.0.12). Statistics and reproducibility All statistics are described throughout the methods. Briefly, for all RNA-seq data we utilized a cutoff of FDR (or adjusted p-value) < 0.05. For pathway analysis (i.e. GSEA analysis) as indicated in the methods we used a FDR < 0.25, which is the recommended statistical cutoff to utilize for GSEA analysis92.

    "results": "Results Spaceflight demonstrates global impact of insulin and estrogen signals across different organs in female mice To understand how insulin and estrogen signaling change during spaceflight we examined gene expression in mice that were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. For this purpose, adrenal glands (OSD-98), kidney (OSD-102), liver (OSD-168), eyes (OSD-100), and skeletal muscles (i.e. quadriceps (OSD-103), gastrocnemius (OSD-101), soleus (OSD-104), tibialis anterior (OSD-105), and extensor digitorum longus (OSD-99)) were utilized (Fig. 1a). The transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) was obtained for 16-week-old female mice from the NASA GeneLab platform28 and were analyzed for insulin signaling, estrogen signaling and insulin resistance related genes and pathways. The gene lists for these hormones were obtained from the  resource29 (i.e. ‘insulin signaling’ mus musculus). The greatest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed in the mouse liver (n = 3670), followed by soleus (n = 3518) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (n = 1859) muscles. In all, 2677 DEGs were unique to the liver, 2048 DEGs were unique to soleus muscle, and 784 DEGs were unique to EDL (Fig. 1b). The least number of DEGs was noted in the adrenal gland (n = 61) and 28 of them were unique to it (Fig. 1b). There are a total of 1970 unique genes from the  curated gene list which are commonly encountered across insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling pathways. Most of the genes from the  list related to insulin resistance, insulin signaling, and estrogen signaling were downregulated in the liver (Fig. 1c). In total, 645 out of the 1970 unique genes from the  resource had gene expression values across all nine tissues. These genes were divided into seven biologically relevant clusters associated with insulin resistance and signaling (Fig. 1d). In particular, the last cluster (cluster 7) at the bottom of the heatmap were related to Gene Ontology (GO) processes30 such as lipid localization and glycerolipid metabolic processes which are related to obesity which in turn can lead to a decrease in insulin sensitivity31 (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Hierarchical clustering of genes shows clusters being related to GO biological processes relevant to insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling (Fig. S1). e Venn diagram of insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling pathways with their corresponding unique and overlapping genes from the  curated gene list. There are a total of 145 genes that are common across all three pathways.In general, two genes were differentially expressed (i.e., upregulated) across all tissues in the RR-1 samples; ARNTL and NPAS2. Across skeletal muscles, 21 DEGs were commonly encountered, out of which 11 DEGs were upregulated and 9 DEGs were downregulated. UCKL1OS was only upregulated in soleus. Many of them were related to the circadian clock, such as NR1D2, NPAS2, PER2, PER3, CIART, DBP, ARNTL, and SOX4. In terms of insulin signaling linked genes, in muscles, ARNTL, MT1, SOX4 were upregulated and DBP and PER2 were downregulated. The genes associated with circadian rhythm, indicates the global effect of spaceflight on the circadian clock and its association with insulin signaling. Overall, from our analysis, the liver was the most impacted organ by spaceflight, with the highest number of DEGs, alongside insulin and estrogen receptor signaling predicted to be inhibited (z-scores: −3.772 and −5.859, respectively). Common insulin and estrogen signaling genes altered by spaceflight in female rodents To determine if there are any universally shared insulin and estrogen pathways being regulated throughout the different organs during spaceflight, we performed further analysis on the 145 shared genes linked to insulin and estrogen signaling as well as insulin resistance (Fig. 1e). 56 out of 145 common genes across the insulin resistance and insulin signaling pathways had gene expression values across all nine tissues. The genes were clustered into three clusters where the top enriched pathways from GO processes were: triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle remodeling for cluster 1, positive regulation of insulin secretion for cluster 2, and carbohydrate homeostasis for cluster 3 (Fig. 2a). The disease enrichment analysis revealed that 62 out of 145 genes were associated with diseases, with the top enriched disease being diabetes mellitus, followed by fatty liver (Fig. 2b). Human genes at the intersection of these pathways were used in a similar manner, and the top enriched disease was obesity, followed by hypertension (Fig. 2c). Thus, enriched diseases in both species emphasize the importance of insulin and estrogen signaling in metabolic diseases. Fig. 2. Insulin resistance, insulin and estrogen signaling related genes and diseases. Open in a new tab a Heatmap for 56 out of 145 common genes across the insulin resistance and insulin signaling pathways for which there were gene expression values across all nine tissues. b Disease enrichment plot showing top 10 diseases from mouse genome database (MGD) being enriched using 145 unique genes common across insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling. The y axis shows the disease labels and the x axis shows the ratio of disease relevant genes to the total number of genes found from the 145 genes that were present in MGD. The dots in the enrichment plots are colored by the FDR values and the sizes of the dots indicate the number of genes found to be enriched for a disease. Diabetes and fatty liver are the top two enriched diseases which are related to estrogen and insulin signaling. c Disease enrichment plot is shown with top 10 diseases from human curated sources (e.g., UniProt, ClinGen) using species relevant genes out of 145 genes from the  list. Obesity and fatty liver are the top two enriched diseases which are also related to estrogen and insulin signaling.Further pathway analysis utilizing gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), focused on specific insulin and estrogen pathways, demonstrated differences in the enrichment of gene sets across organs (Fig. 3a). The majority of gene sets related to insulin and insulin resistance were predicted to be inhibited in the liver (OSD-168) such as insulin receptor signaling pathway, response to troglitazone and adipogenesis (Fig. 3a). Kidney (OSD-102) and eye (OSD-100) also showed similar inhibition for insulin pathways, such as insulin pathway, insulin receptor signaling pathway, response to insulin (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, a set of muscle tissues (i.e. tibialis anterior (OSD-105) and EDL (OSD-99)) were shown to be activated for response to insulin, while the quadriceps (OSD-103) and gastrocnemius (OSD-101) showed negative enrichment scores for response to insulin (Fig. 3a). It is known that during spaceflight the soleus muscle is impacted first with muscle mass loss which can lead to downstream dysregulation related to metabolic, inflammatory, and immune functions32. Fig. 3. Gene set enrichment analysis of insulin and estrogen pathways. Open in a new tab a A heatmap of the normalized enrichment scores (NES) of estrogen and insulin pathways impacted by spaceflight in datasets of RR-1 mission samples. The dark gray locations in the heatmap indicate missing values for the NES, resulting from off-range adjusted p-values (padj) at which the NES is obtained. The assumed range is padj < 0.3. A positive NES indicates activation of the pathways, while at negative NES the pathway is inhibited. In the pathways, the full meaning of CRGS is ‘Cellular Response to Glucose Stimulus’; and the full meaning of IERSP is ‘Intracellular Estrogen Receptor Signaling Pathway’. The pathways are categorized into several types, and the MSigDB database from which the pathway is sourced is indicated in parentheses. b A heatmap of the t-score of the overlapping leading-edge pathway genes across the datasets of the RR-1 mission samples. The dark gray locations in the heatmap indicate the absence of a value for the t-score, resulting from off-range adjusted p-values (padj) at which the t-score is obtained. The assumed range is padj < 0.05. The leading-edge genes are the genes that contribute to the GSEA predicted pathways. The overlapping leading-edge genes are commonly leading-edge genes to at least four of the datasets.Overall, there are similar organ dependent patterns for estrogen-specific pathways observed (Fig. 3a). Estrogen metabolism and signaling pathways were negatively enriched in the kidney (OSD-102), liver (OSD-168), and quadriceps muscle (OSD-103). Specific estrogen signaling pathways, such as pubertal breast, were negatively enriched in the liver, eye, and adrenal gland, while being positively enriched in the (OSD-99) and tibialis anterior (OSD-105) muscles (Fig. 3a). When analyzing the specific leading-edge genes involved in the insulin and estrogen pathway predictions, we observed that a subset of these genes were related to the circadian rhythm (i.e., ARNTL, CLOCK, CRY2, PER3, NFIL3, and NR1D2) (Fig. 3b). The majority of these gene expressions were in the same direction across organs; however, some unique differences were observed. PFKM was upregulated only in the soleus muscle (OSD-104) (Fig. 3b). Gene expression changes and proteomics suggest underlying insulin resistance in spaceflight-induced hepatosteatosis Notably, the liver is a key metabolic organ that orchestrates and regulates a plethora of metabolic pathways, including estrogen and insulin signaling33. During spaceflight, the liver RNA-seq data exhibits the most pronounced and unique impact on metabolic pathways as well as insulin and estrogen signaling. A comprehensive analysis of liver samples harvested after 37 days of spaceflight, revealed that both insulin and estrogen receptor signaling are predicted to be inhibited in the liver during spaceflight, as compared to ground controls (z-scores: −3.772 and −5.859, respectively). Our findings indicate that several genes of the insulin signaling pathway denoted development of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis (z-scores: 2.481 and 3.737, respectively). Furthermore, insulin receptor was downregulated in the liver during spaceflight, along with inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which may indicate derangement of mitochondrial activity. In addition, disruption of estrogen signaling has been extensively reported to aggravate hepatic insulin resistance33,34. According to this evidence, our analysis showed inhibition of estrogen receptor signaling in the liver during spaceflight (z-score: −5.859). Remarkably, genes associated with mitochondrial complex I, complex II, and ATP synthase were downregulated in the estrogen signaling network (Fig. 4a). This is particularly relevant considering that estrogen receptors play a key role in mitochondrial activity and biogenesis35–37. In livers harvested from mice after spaceflight, we observed impairment of estrogen signaling, which in turn may hamper oxidative phosphorylation by mainly affecting complex I (Fig. 4a)38. Fig. 4.

Open in a new tab a The hepatic steatosis canonical pathway with the significantly regulated genes for liver tissue from mice flown to space compared to ground control mice. The lower panel is the mitochondrial complexes and the significantly regulated genes involved visualized by ShinyGo v0.76.3 and KEGG pathway diagrams. The boxes highlighted in yellow indicate genes related to estrogen receptor signaling. Panel was created in BioRender. b Lollipop plot illustrating the normalized enrichment scores (NES) of hepatic steatosis pathways in OSD-168 (liver tissue). Only pathways with a NES obtained at an adjusted p-value <0.3 (padj < 0.3) are shown. c An illustration of common leading-edge genes across pathways of insulin and estrogen in a heatmap of the normalized enrichment scores (NES) of the pathways impacted by spaceflight in OSD-168 (liver tissue). Only pathways with NES at padj < 0.3 are shown, and only genes that are among leading edge genes seven (7) or more of the pathways are shown.Specific analysis of pathways related to hepatic steatosis (Fig. 4b, c) revealed that the SREBP pathway was one of the top positively enriched pathways (Fig. 4b). This pathway is known to be involved in metabolic-associated chronic liver diseases such as Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)39. Furthermore, response to insulin and insulin signaling pathways were universally enriched in hepatic steatosis during spaceflight, with insulin receptor (INSR) and downstream targets (i.e IRS1, AKT1, AKT2) among the top enriched genes for hepatic steatosis (Fig. 4c). Among the top leading genes, we additionally identified MFN2, which encodes for Mitofusin 2, a mitochondrial fusion protein associated with insulin signaling and oxidative stress in NAFLD40,41. In summary, our findings suggest that during spaceflight, alterations of insulin and estrogen signaling may lead to the development of hepatic steatosis. We also performed proteomics analysis using RR-1 data, which revealed that the liver displayed the most insulin and estrogen-related protein abundance changes (Fig. 5a). In the liver, proteins involved in lipid metabolism such as hormone sensitive lipase, Apoe, Sphk2 and Ldlr, showed notable changes in protein abundance. These proteins are also linked to insulin signaling, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolism disorder (Fig. 5b–e). Lipe encodes hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) which hydrolyses lipids (i.e. triacylglycerols) in various tissues. Insulin inhibits HSL activity while counteracting hormones such as glucocorticoids, glucagon, and catecholamines activate HSL during stress or starvation42. Increased ApoE protein abundance was observed in the kidney, adrenal gland, and significantly in the liver (Fig. 5c, d). Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is one of the major lipoproteins in the cholesterol metabolism and it uptakes VLDL, IDL and chylomicron remnants from the circulation. It is also a major ligand for the LDL receptor. There was a significant increase in the abundance of LDL receptors in the liver, while it decreased in the adrenal gland (Fig. 5c–e). In terms of estrogen signaling related proteins, we observed changes in protein abundance associated with mitochondrial complexes (Fig. 5f). This was observed mostly in muscles, and the majority of these mitochondrial proteins belong to NADH dehydrogenases in complex I (i.e. NDUFA5 encodes a subunit of complex I) (Fig. 5f). Fig. 5. Quantitative proteomics screening of different tissues from the RR1 mission samples. Open in a new tab a Heatmaps for logFC (Flight vs. Ground) of proteins across the estrogen signaling, insulin signaling, and insulin resistance pathways. Normalized protein intensity values were used to calculate the logFC through the Limma package. Columns represent datasets from different tissues in the RR1 missions, and rows correspond to proteins. The gray cells in the heatmap indicate missing values. Asterisks (*) overlaying cells denote statistical significance (p-value < 0.05). Liver displayed the most protein abundance changes across these pathways. Protein abundance changes for (b) insulin receptor signaling, (c) insulin resistance, (d) hepatic steatosis, (e) glucose metabolism disorders, and (f) estrogen receptor signaling, were also depicted in different heatmaps. All 0 values for b–f are for proteins which were not present in the data. Alterations in insulin and estrogen linked genes in the rodent skin Both insulin and estrogen act in the skin and contribute to important functions such as wound healing and skin integrity. Further, certain skin conditions have been associated with insulin resistance (i.e., acanthosis nigricans)43. Thus, we utilized rodent data sets (RR-5, RR-7, MHU-2) to analyze skin gene expressions linked to insulin resistance, insulin, and estrogen signaling. We observed differences in pathway enrichment scores between female and male mice (Fig. 6a). During the first 25 days of flight, estrogen and insulin signaling, as well as insulin resistance pathways, were negatively enriched in the skin of female C3H mice; however, these pathways were positively enriched during the 75 days of flight (Fig. 6a). We also noted similarities and differences across strains. Within the same mission (RR-7), pathway enrichments in C3H mice varied based on flight duration, while the insulin resistance pathway was positively enriched in C57BL mice regardless of flight duration (Fig. 6a). The insulin resistance pathway was positively enriched during 75 days of flight in two different strains (Fig. 6a). Further, in female mice, the insulin resistance pathway was positively enriched in various strains and different missions, except in C3H strains exposed to 25 days of flight (Fig. 6a). In the skin of male mice, differences in enrichment scores were observed based on the tissue (dorsal vs femoral skin) and diet (Fig. 6a). Fig. 6.

Columns represent datasets from multiple spaceflight missions, and rows correspond to genes. Asterisks (*) overlaying cells denote statistical significance; genes must be significant in at least one of the datasets to be displayed.In female and male rodent skin samples, we found differences in gene expressions related to insulin and estrogen signaling (Fig. 6b). Most of the significant up- and downregulations were observed in the male mice, especially in the dorsal skin (Fig. 6B). Certain genes involved in tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix, wound healing, and collagen synthesis (i.e., ACE, FN1, IGFBP5, MMP3, COL6A3, COL6A1, COL1A1, COL5A1, BGN, FASN, LOXL2) were downregulated only in male mice (Fig. 6b). FN1 encodes fibronectin which is an essential component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and participates in cell migration, adhesion, and wound repair44. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in tissue remodeling; MMP3 regulates the rate of wound healing and was downregulated in the skin of male mice45. Further, epidermal lipids contribute to the skin’s barrier function46. Fatty acids can be synthesized in the epidermis, and FASN encodes fatty acid synthase, which was downregulated in male mice. Insulin receptor (INSR), IRS2, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and ESRRG were upregulated in male mice dorsal skin (Fig. 6b). Estrogen promotes skin and mucosa epithelialization47,48. Sex differences may play a role in wound healing and variations in healing rates have been reported in literature49,50. In female mice, S100s9, Nr4a2, Nr4a3, Il6, and Egf2 were significantly downregulated only in the skin of C3H mice during 25 days of flight (Fig. 6b). Although we noticed some changes in the pathway enrichment scores, results need to be interpreted carefully, due to differences in missions, durations, strains, housing, and diet. Changes in insulin signaling genes and pathways conserved in astronauts To explore if insulin and estrogen signaling-related genes are affected in astronauts during spaceflight, human samples were used to map genes of interest. We utilized astronaut data from the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study mission51 with astronauts in space for 120 days. Specifically, for the JAXA mission RNA-seq was conducted on plasma cell-free RNAs (cfRNAs) from 6 astronauts that were on the International Space Station (ISS) for 120 days from pre-flight, during flight, and post flight time points. Insulin signaling linked genes are dysregulated during and after spaceflight in astronauts (Fig. 7a). Some genes were specifically upregulated within the first month upon return (R + 3d, R + 30d) such as AVP, FFAR4, GLP1R, RIMS2, FGF6, NR1H4, PRLH, CPE, and APOM. The FFAR4 encodes free fatty acid receptor 4, is widely expressed in tissues and has been associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases52. The GLP1R is another key gene encoding glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor which stimulates insulin secretion (Fig. 7a). Additionally, insulin secretion was among the enriched pathways (Fig. 7a). GLP-1 receptor agonist is currently used in the treatment of diabetes and obesity53. Fig. 7. Insulin Signaling linked genes and pathways from JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE). Open in a new tab a Heatmap of the significantly upregulated genes compared to pre-flight for either flight or post-flight of normalized plasma cell-free RNA expression values and associated pathways for insulin signaling over time for the six astronauts over 120 days in space from JAXA study. The values shown on are the averaged normalized expression values for all six astronauts each time point during flight and post-flight. The four pre-flight time points were averaged together, since the changes for genes in the time leading up to flight are considered to be the same and part of the baseline values. For the time, L = Launch (i.e., meaning time after launch from Earth and length in space) and R = Return to Earth.

The pathways and lollipop plots demonstrate top 30 pathways (based on FDR). The red bold font texts are the pathways that are directly known to regulate the insulin pathway in the pathway figure.Certain genes involved in insulin signaling were upregulated throughout the postflight period. MAF is a transcription factor that is known to regulate and activate insulin gene expression54 (Fig. 7a). Similarly, RARRES2, which encodes chemerin, was also upregulated throughout postflight. Chemerin is an adipokine that is associated with insulin resistance and obesity55. AKT1 is the main downstream of insulin signaling and was upregulated during postflight which also correlates with the postflight PI3K/AKT enrichment (Fig. 7a). CRH, GCGR, and SLC2A3 are other important genes related to endocrine hormones and insulin. The glucagon receptor, encoded by GCGR, is the primary receptor for glucagon. Glucagon counteracts the actions of insulin and has a role in stress response56. The GCGR was upregulated throughout the entire postflight period (Fig. 7b). SLC2A3 encodes for a glucose transporter named GLUT3 and is widely expressed in various cells. SLC2A3 was downregulated upon return from spaceflight (Fig. 7b). The cholesterol metabolism was the top activated pathway for postflight upregulated genes involved in insulin signaling (Fig. 7a). Insulin secretion, regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, Cushing syndrome, and circadian entrainment were other enriched pathways (Fig. 7a). Glucagon signaling was the top activated pathway for downregulated genes associated with insulin signaling (Fig. 7b). Insulin resistance, lipid and atherosclerosis, AMPK signaling, oxytocin signaling and viral infection related pathways (i.e., HPV, CMV infections, HTLV1) were other enriched pathways (Fig. 7b). The MS4A1 gene encodes CD20, a B-cell marker, and it was downregulated during postflight but upregulated during flight (Fig. 7b). Further, some of the gene expressions changed at specific time points. Interestingly, CRP was upregulated upon return (R + 3d) and was downregulated a month later (R + 30d) (Fig. 7a). Follow-up samples showed upregulation of CRP on the second and third months postflight (Fig. 7a). CRP is also linked to estrogen signaling and insulin resistance (Figs. 8a, 9a). This is important as the CRP gene encodes c-reactive protein, which is an inflammatory marker. Elevated CRP levels correlate with both fasting insulin and insulin resistance parameters (i.e. HOMA-IR)57. Fig. 8. Insulin Resistant linked genes and pathways from JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE).

The red bold font texts are the pathways that are directly known to regulate the estrogen signaling pathway in the pathway figure. Insulin Resistance related genes and pathways during and after spaceflight The majority of insulin signaling related genes and their alterations could result in insulin resistance which would be a great concern during long-term spaceflight. AKT1 was upregulated and AKT3 was downregulated throughout the postflight period (Fig. 8a, b). AKT1 and AKT3 are members of serine/threonine kinases and are downstream of insulin signaling. Insulin resistance can be seen with hormonal dysfunctions like acromegaly, hyperaldosteronism, and Cushing disease58. Aldosterone is responsible for fluid and sodium balance and CYP11B2, and encodes aldosterone synthase, which was upregulated within the first week upon return from spaceflight (R + 3d) (Fig. 8a), a period that overlaps with intravascular fluid changes upon return. Other genes associated with insulin resistance are MT-ND1 and MT-ND6. MT-ND1, and MT-ND6 genes encode subunits of NADH dehydrogenase in mitochondria complex I. Both genes were upregulated during spaceflight (Fig. 8a, b). Mitochondria are the center of many biochemical pathways, and one of them is fatty acid oxidation where insulin and estrogen exert their effects. CD36 and CPT1A are other key genes in fatty acid metabolism and were upregulated during the various phases of spaceflight (Fig. 8b). The CD36 is responsible for fatty acid uptake into cells and is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. LEPR, APP, CXCL5, LYPLAL1, GHL3 are other upregulated insulin resistance related genes during flight (Fig. 8b). In the pathway analysis, postflight upregulated genes linked to insulin resistance, showed enrichment of endocrine resistance, estrogen signaling, cholesterol metabolism, regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) pathways (Fig. 8a). Downregulated genes in flight or postflight vs preflight are given in Fig. 8b. There was a trend of upregulation of these genes during spaceflight (Fig. 8b). These genes showed enriched pathways of insulin resistance, type II diabetes mellitus, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications and diabetic cardiomyopathy (Fig. 8b). The genes involved in insulin signaling and resistance from human data revolve around key cellular metabolic events such as lipid metabolism, viral infection pathways, and estrogen signaling. The endocrine-metabolic signature observed here illustrates the prominence of regulation of action of insulin during and after spaceflight. Additionally, there is a prominent immune-mediated cytokine and adipokine response to spaceflight in humans. This corroborates growth inducing actions of insulin via the prominent PI3K/Akt and the Ras/MAPK pathways. Estrogen signaling related genes and their pathways during and after spaceflight ESR1 encodes Estrogen Receptor 1 (Estrogen Receptor alpha), the primary receptor for estrogens, which is widely expressed in both rodents and humans. Estrogen signaling via this receptor can alter energy metabolism and conversely, gonadal estrogen production is regulated by the state of energy. ESR1-regulated pathways include insulin signaling, insulin resistance, leptin signaling, and fatty acid synthesis. ESR1 was upregulated within 2 months (R + 3d, R + 30d, R + 60d) and then downregulated again in the 3rd month (R + 120d) postflight (Fig. 9a). A similar trend during postflight was observed for PER1 expressions (Fig. 9a). PER1 encodes Per1 protein, which is one of the major components of circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythm and circadian clock genes are closely related to metabolism and hormones. CYP17A1 was upregulated during postflight, which encodes a key enzyme in steroidogenesis for cortisol and sex steroid synthesis (Fig. 9a). Estrogen-related genes altered postflight, with most being upregulated throughout the postflight period (Fig. 9a), included ZNF423, GAL, EGFR, FST, PAX2, SLC34A1, GREB1, F5, FGF23, AKT1 and NOS1. These genes are also implicated in the constitutive PIK3CA signaling pathway and myogenesis. This could be a direct effect of spaceflight-induced physical stress as nuclear-initiated estrogen signaling (NICE) can induce corticotropin-releasing hormone CRH through the induction of nitric oxide (NOS1 upregulation) and via PI3K signaling activation59. Similarly, selected genes CRHR2, PRKCD, TRIM24, IL6ST, MALAT1, OXTR, INPP4B, KMT2C, LEPR, and TAB2 within the downregulated cohort revealing a consistent pattern of change with spaceflight represent a niche of interleukin 6/JAK/STAT3 and MAPK signaling. Estrogen-linked upregulated genes at postflight showed that steroid hormone biosynthesis was the top activated pathway (Fig. 9a). Other enriched pathways were ovarian steroidogenesis, estrogen signaling, Cushing syndrome, and retinol metabolism in favor of stress response and sex steroid synthesis. Estrogen-linked downregulated genes and their associated pathways showed activation of insulin resistance, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, lipid and atherosclerosis, and growth hormone synthesis pathways (Fig. 9b). Estrogen also has a role in immunity, and enrichment of viral infection pathways like CMV, HTLV1 and HPV infections are also detected (Fig. 9b). Intricate dance of insulin and estrogen signaling and insulin resistance Some of the genes in the human samples were related to both insulin and estrogen signaling as well as insulin resistance including IGFBP1, FGF23, WNT5A, CRP, ESR1, EGFR, FST, NCOR1, CD36, CYP17A1, SHBG, KISS1, LEPR. The leptin receptor (LEPR) and its signaling are crucial for metabolism and obesity31. LEPR was downregulated upon return from spaceflight, regardless of the time interval (Figs. 7b, 8b, and 9b). The CYP17A1 gene was upregulated upon return (Fig. 7a). CYP17A1, encodes steroidogenic enzymes, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, and 17,20 lyase. These enzymes are responsible for the production of cortisol, estrogen and androgens, and their deficiencies have been linked to both hormonal imbalance and metabolic dysfunction such as hypertension. Most hormones bind to proteins in the circulation. Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) binds sex steroid hormones (estrogen and testosterone), and because of this interaction, the amount of SHBG is important as decreasing SHBG levels may lead to increasing free testosterone and estradiol levels, and vice versa. SHGB was upregulated 1 month upon return (R + 30d) and downregulated at the 3rd month (Figs. 7a, 8a, and 9a). Overlapping pathways were also observed such as PI3K-Akt signaling, cAMP signaling, insulin resistance, and estrogen signaling. It is well known that changes in estrogen signaling have been associated with insulin resistance60, as seen in our results showing the enrichment of the estrogen signaling pathway via insulin resistance linked genes. Viral infection related pathways are enriched with both insulin and estrogen downregulated genes (Figs. 7b and 9b). Insulin and estrogen signaling changes are observed in multiple human missions To explore if sex differently impacted insulin signaling, estrogen signaling, and insulin resistance, we utilized astronaut data (2 female and 2 male) from the first civilian commercial 3-day space mission, referred to as Inspiration4 (i4)61. From the i4 mission, single-cell gene expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and skin spatial transcriptomics data were generated. Genes in the estrogen signaling, insulin signaling, and insulin resistance overlapped less than 10% with DEGs at R + 1 from PBMCs and subpopulations (CD4 T, CD8 T, other T, B, NK, CD14 Mono, CD16 Mono, DC) (Fig. 10a). Among these overlapping genes, the percentage of the upregulated genes were higher than downregulated genes (Fig. 10a). Log2 Female DEGs to Male DEGs ratios varied across cell types, based on insulin and estrogen linked gene categories. Log2 Female DEGs to Male DEGs ratios were positive in most cell types for insulin signaling (i.e. PBMCs, CD4 T, CD8 T, NK, DC, and ‘other’ subpopulations) (Fig. 10b). Certain cell types showed either a positive or negative ratio, depending on the hormone of interest. For instance, in females, in terms of DC, the DEGs ratio was positive for insulin-linked genes, but negative for estrogen-linked genes. In estrogen signaling, downregulated genes of B and other cell types were higher in females (Fig. 10b). In CD4 T cells, the ratios were positive in insulin, estrogen signaling and IR linked genes (Fig. 10b). We also calculated insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, and insulin signaling scores to track the changes over spaceflight. Higher enrichment scores were observed in all signaling pathways on R + 82, in comparison to R + 1 (Fig. 10c). In general, there was not a strong sex difference across cells (Fig. 10c). In certain cell types, differences in enrichment scores were observed depending on mission timeline and sex (Fig. 10c). In dendritic cells (DC), three pathways were positively enriched on R + 82 in both sexes; however, enrichment scores were different among females and males on R + 45 (Fig. 10c). T cell metabolism is modulated through insulin receptor signaling during inflammation and infection62. Alternatively, energy consumption due to T cell activation drives upregulation of insulin receptors63. Therefore, it is evident that insulin signaling is a key immune-metabolic event during increased physiologic demands, as in i4 cohort findings. Similarly, estrogen receptor alpha is known to mediate T cell-dependent inflammatory reactions in a diseased state12. Fig. 10.

The color scale bar represents fold change values.We also compared these findings in human skin data. To perform spatial transcriptomics analysis, we compared transcript profiles of preflight (L-44) and postflight (R + 1) tissue sections across four compartments within the skin, including outer epidermis (OE), inner epidermis (IE), outer dermis (OD) and vasculature (VA). While statistical analysis is limited by small sample sizes, we found slight differences between male and female skin compartments. Using the ssGSEA approach, overall, we observed increased enrichments in insulin resistance genes and decreased enrichments in estrogen and insulin signaling genes. There were slight sex differences, and the degrees of variation were region-specific. For example, we saw the strongest loss and sex-dependent variation of estrogen and insulin signaling signatures in VA regions (Fig. 10d). Insulin resistance linked genes were more enriched in females in the postflight vascular compartment and outer epidermis relative to preflight samples. In inner epidermis, both insulin and estrogen-signaling-linked genes showed larger changes in enrichments in females than in males.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Consistent with past reports that insulin signaling is a central regulator of gene expression changes and lipid metabolism in response to spaceflight in the worm, C. elegans64,65, we find that gene expression changes related to insulin signaling occur in spaceflown rodents and humans. Further, we find that estrogen signaling gene expression changes also occur in both spaceflown rodents and humans. In mice, the liver and soleus muscle were the tissues that displayed the largest changes in global gene expression (Fig. 1b). These tissues also displayed large changes in insulin and estrogen signaling gene expression (Fig. 1c, d). In the liver, insulin receptor (INSR) and downstream kinases AKT1 and AKT2 were downregulated during spaceflight. These changes were accompanied by decreased expression of other insulin receptor signaling genes. The metabolic pathways directly controlled by insulin were inhibited, which resulted in activation of dysglycemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. This last prediction is particularly striking given the increase in liver mass in these mice in a prior study utilizing the same cohort66. Hepatic steatosis is a direct consequence of insulin resistance and can in turn exacerbate insulin resistance, leading to the development of a metabolic syndrome, and thus resulting in a vicious cycle67. Prior studies have reported that during spaceflight, mice developed hepatomegaly66 and hepatic lipid accumulation68,69. Further, the livers used in our analysis showed histologic evidence of lipid accumulation via Oil Red O staining in a prior study68. Thus, our results suggest that disrupted insulin signaling may underlie these changes. In addition to the insulin signaling changes, the impaired estrogen signaling we observed (z-score < −2), may contribute to hepatic insulin resistance. In rodents, both male and female estrogen receptor knockout mice display insulin resistance15. Further, both insulin and estrogen actively play a role in metabolism and our findings also suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction, previously reported during spaceflight2, may be due to alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling (Fig. 4a). PGC-1α, encoded by PPARGA1A, is a master regulator in metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis70. PPARGC1A downregulation in the liver was observed in both insulin and estrogen gene expression changes. Additionally, estrogen regulates mitochondrial function and biogenesis35–37. In our liver data, downregulation of mitochondrial complex I, complex 2, and ATP synthase genes were observed in the estrogen signaling network (Fig. 4a). Thus, alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling in the liver may contribute to whole body alterations in metabolism in response to spaceflight. Soleus muscle was the second most affected tissue in mouse studies. Soleus is a slow twitch (type I) muscle fiber, dense in mitochondria to provide sustained oxidative capacity for long-term demands. Prior studies show atrophy in the soleus muscle after spaceflight in both rodents and humans66, and differential gene expressions between soleus and EDL muscle in rodents71. Myostatin (MSTN) controls muscle mass and has been reported to be upregulated in microgravity in the soleus muscle but not in EDL72; we confirm this observation. Other muscle atrophy related genes, FBX032 (Atrogin-1) and TRIM63, and mechanoreceptor PIEZO1 were also downregulated in the soleus. The downregulation of FBX032 and TRIM63 suggest the decline in soleus muscle size66 is not caused by increases in muscle protein degradation. This is consistent with past reports that muscle protein degradation is not increased in flight, but rather that protein synthesis declines73. Previous studies in astronauts have suggested that altered insulin signaling may underlie muscle atrophy25. Further, in a prior study from the same mission, mice soleus muscle weight was decreased by 19%, despite no change in body weight and being physically active in space66. Given that insulin promotes protein synthesis, our finding of decreased expression in soleus of IRS2 (Insulin receptor substrate 2), one of major downstream insulin signaling, suggests that insulin alterations contribute to declines in protein synthesis to promote muscle atrophy in flight; this is also consistent with suggestions from spaceflown C. elegans65. On the contrary, insulin receptor signaling was activated in the EDL (z-score: 2.52). Moreover, insulin-induced ACACA, a rate-limiting enzyme in lipogenesis, was upregulated indicating an insulin responsive state in the EDL. Further, the majority of the insulin signaling significant genes at the intersection of soleus and EDL were regulated in opposite directions, which shows distinctive insulin response in these muscles (Supplementary Data 1). Estrogen also promotes muscle growth, regeneration, insulin sensitivity, and controls muscle inflammation14,74. Estrogen-related receptor beta and gamma (ESRRB, ESRRG) induce mitochondrial function in myotubes and have a role in shifting muscle fibers towards oxidative types75. Muscle-specific ESR1 knockout mice models showed decreased oxidative metabolism, impaired mitochondrial fission and glucose metabolism76. Thus, our findings that ESR1 receptor was upregulated and ESRRB and ESRRG were downregulated in soleus, while ESRRA, ESRRB, ESRRG were all upregulated in the EDL, suggest diverse actions of estrogen in muscle metabolism during spaceflight. Interestingly, while soleus size declined and EDL remained stable, as consistent with past studies66, the gene expression changes in soleus and EDL were distinct with EDL displaying an enrichment for growth pathways (Fig. 3), also consistent with prior studies71. Estrogen receptor signaling pathways were activated in both EDL and soleus muscles. Soleus muscle mass recovery is reported to be slower after hindlimb suspension in ovariectomized mice77. Additionally, increased estrogen receptor expressions were reported following muscle trauma in regenerating myofibers74. Thus, estrogen receptor signaling activation and upregulation of ESR1 could be a compensatory mechanism against muscle disuse in the soleus muscle, whereas, in EDL the ESR signaling activation could support muscle growth and energy metabolism. Adipose tissue is another endocrine organ which is a part of cross-talk between muscle and liver. Our results are limited to muscle and liver, as adipose tissue was not available for analysis. Studies in humans have more constraints than in model organisms, thus for the present study we were limited to blood samples and skin in spaceflown humans. However, as insulin and estrogen are circulating hormones, changes in their effects should be detected in these tissues; albeit at lower levels such as in the non-liver and non-soleus tissues in rodents (Fig. 1). As with the worm and rodent data, changes in insulin resistance related genes were detected inflight and postflight. Postflight samples from human subjects displayed upregulated insulin signaling genes (i.e., AKT1, RARRES2) as well as enriched insulin secretion and PI3K/AKT signaling (Fig. 8a), possibly suggesting decline in these pathways inflight. Additionally, postflight upregulation of the glucagon signaling pathway may indicate underlying postflight stress and may result in insulin resistance. Overall, postflight up- and down-regulated genes associated with insulin signaling displayed enriched lipid metabolism, hormones (i.e., estrogen, growth hormone, glucagon), circadian rhythm, and immune system pathways. Also, in the human data, we found the estrogen signaling pathway was enriched with insulin related genes. ESR1 was upregulated within 2 months (R + 3d, R + 30d, R + 60d) and then downregulated in the 3rd month (R + 120d). In correlation with this finding CYP17A1 was upregulated postflight. These findings may explain the enriched ovarian steroidogenesis and steroid hormone synthesis pathways seen postflight. Estrogen is closely related to the immune system, as an example, Treg cell distribution changes during menstrual cycles and increases during the follicular phase78. In our data, dendritic cells in females showed higher enrichment scores in estrogen and insulin linked genes on R + 45 than male counterparts (Fig. 10c). Sex difference was also observed in both rodent and human skin samples. In human skin, in the vascular region (VA) of the dermis, insulin resistance-related genes were more enriched in females during postflight while insulin and estrogen signaling-related genes were less enriched (Fig. 10d). In rodent skin samples, certain genes associated with tissue remodeling and collagen synthesis (i.e. COL1A1, COL6A3, COL6A1, COL5A1) (Fig. 6b) were downregulated in male mice (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, increased urinary COL1A1 and COL3A1 levels have been reported in the NASA twin study79. Insulin and estrogen both play an active role in skin homeostasis, and insulin resistance has been linked to certain skin conditions43. Dermis is a connective tissue rich in vasculature, fibroblasts, collagen and elastic fibers, glands, hair follicles, and nerve endings. Both insulin and estrogen signaling exist in vascular endothelium and cause vasodilation via nitric oxide80,81. Insulin-resistant states could impair vascular endothelium82,83. Estrogen promotes skin and mucosal epithelialization and proliferation. Studies reported positive impact of estrogen in wound healing84. Clinically, topical estrogen is used in the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy, and it proliferates epithelium48. Although our findings are limited by sample size, differences in the enrichment scores based on sex and skin compartments warrant future research on skin conditions after spaceflight in a sex and hormone-dependent manner. Further, due to our study setting, we cannot conclude on certain space-related environmental factors, such as lunar soil and dust, and their effects on insulin and estrogen signaling in the skin. In conclusion, we find insulin and estrogen signaling are altered during and after spaceflight in rodents and people. These changes impact metabolism and forebode comorbidities. One advantage of the rodent data is that genes for pathways of interest were examined in various tissues from the same sample cohort, including mice of the same strain and age. However, a key limitation of our study is the small number of human participants. Future studies should include different rodent strains, more human subjects, and different mission profiles to gain more knowledge on these genes/pathways of interest and expand our results. Particular attention should be paid to the effects on reproductive hormone synthesis and actions, as these impact a wide range of tissues, including bone health, energy metabolism and, of course species survival via reproduction. Personalized healthcare using genomic data is the way of the future for both Earth and beyond85. Therefore, as we progress toward becoming an interplanetary species, further study on reproductive endocrinology and metabolism in space is essential for success.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166981 PMID: 38862620 Abstract Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans. Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species. Subject terms: Systems biology, Computational biology and bioinformatics Analysis of data from mice having spent time at the International Space Station and from a group of astronauts and a set of commercial spaceflight participants reveals alterations in genes related to insulin and estrogen signaling during spaceflightIntroduction We have entered an era in which living and working in space is a reality. Studies show that spaceflight has health risks such as central nervous system and cardiovascular dysfunction, cancer risk, immune dysregulation, muscle and bone loss, and fatty liver1. At the molecular level, risks include oxidative stress, DNA damage, cosmic radiation exposure, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome shift, and epigenetic alterations1. Of these, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been identified as major space-related risks2. Mitochondria are not only the powerhouse of the cell but also the center of many metabolic pathways. Insulin is a highly conserved anabolic and mitogenic peptide hormone that acts as a master regulator of energy metabolism across species, including humans3. It is secreted by the pancreas in response to increased plasma glucose, and exerts its effects on most organs including the kidney and liver as well as skeletal muscle, and bone4. Insulin receptor is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)5 and undergoes autophosphorylation upon activation, leading to a downstream signaling cascade which influences cellular function, particularly glucose metabolism. Insulin resistance (IR) arises when these downstream molecular pathways do not respond appropriately in target tissues, thus impeding the physiologic response to insulin. In the physiological state, IR can also be observed due to opposing actions from counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, glucocorticoids, and catecholamines. Insulin resistance is further associated with metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, lipid dysfunction, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Each of these factors is also interconnected, thus resulting in a potentially vicious cycle. The presence of insulin resistance during spaceflight has been reported, and sex differences play a role, with female astronauts displaying better Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) values than male astronauts6,7. Sex differences play a role in diseases and metabolism both on Earth and in space8. Some of these differences may be attributed to sex hormones. Estrogens play a variety of roles and serve many functions in women’s lives. Besides being a reproductive hormone, estrogen is involved in metabolism as well as in the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems9. Estrogen signaling activates membrane and nuclear receptors in both canonical and non-canonical ways to modulate metabolism, and promote growth, proliferation, and differentiation of diverse cell types10,11. Estrogen receptors are ESR1, estrogen receptor beta (ESR2), and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1). There are also estrogen-related receptors alpha, beta and gamma (ESRRA, ESRRB, ESRRG) which are structurally similar to ESR1 and ESR212 but whose ligands are unknown. ESRRA also has DNA sequence homology to the estrogen receptor and can be activated by phytoestrogens (i.e. genistein)13. These receptors play pivotal roles in metabolism, insulin resistance, NAFLD, and mitochondrial function12. Besides that, an unbalanced ratio of these receptors may have an impact on metabolism14. Additionally, estrogen and insulin combine in controlling metabolic pathways. In animal models, knockout of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (ESR1) in both male and female mice results in insulin resistance and dysglycemia15–17. Estrogen receptors promote pancreatic cell survival, enhance insulin production, and improve insulin sensitivity18,19. Female and male ESR1−/− mice both display reduced GLUT4 expression, further emphasizing the role of estrogen in glycemic control14. Clinically, compared to premenopausal women, postmenopausal women have an increased risk of adverse metabolic profiles such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, impaired glucose and lipid profiles, increased android fat deposition, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis20. Estrogens also positively correlate with bone and muscle mass and are protective against disuse atrophy21. Thus, there is substantial reason to believe that insulin and estrogen signaling are key pathways regulating health in space. The amount of knowledge in the literature about how insulin and estrogen signaling and related pathways change during spaceflight is currently sparse. Our preliminary findings reported possible insulin and estrogen signaling alteration during spaceflight22,23. A few published studies show insulin resistance parameters may change during spaceflight but data are conflicting, suggesting either decreased insulin or no change24,25. Similarly, data on estrogen signaling are conflicting with one study revealing downregulation of ESR1 and ESR2 in the uterus26 whereas a recent study found no alterations in estrogen receptor expression in rodent ovaries27. To address these gaps in our knowledge of insulin and estrogen signaling in response to spaceflight we examined these signaling pathways across multiple tissues in rodents from the same mission as well as in a group of astronauts and a set of commercial spaceflight participants/astronauts. Our results indicate significant changes in these pathways in response to spaceflight in both mice and people. These observations lay the foundation for further studies aimed at understanding the metabolic alterations induced by spaceflight as well as highlighting insulin and estrogen signaling as potential targets for countermeasures in future spaceflight missions.Results Spaceflight demonstrates global impact of insulin and estrogen signals across different organs in female mice To understand how insulin and estrogen signaling change during spaceflight we examined gene expression in mice that were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. For this purpose, adrenal glands (OSD-98), kidney (OSD-102), liver (OSD-168), eyes (OSD-100), and skeletal muscles (i.e. quadriceps (OSD-103), gastrocnemius (OSD-101), soleus (OSD-104), tibialis anterior (OSD-105), and extensor digitorum longus (OSD-99)) were utilized (Fig. 1a). The transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) was obtained for 16-week-old female mice from the NASA GeneLab platform28 and were analyzed for insulin signaling, estrogen signaling and insulin resistance related genes and pathways. The gene lists for these hormones were obtained from the  resource29 (i.e. ‘insulin signaling’ mus musculus). The greatest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed in the mouse liver (n = 3670), followed by soleus (n = 3518) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (n = 1859) muscles. In all, 2677 DEGs were unique to the liver, 2048 DEGs were unique to soleus muscle, and 784 DEGs were unique to EDL (Fig. 1b). The least number of DEGs was noted in the adrenal gland (n = 61) and 28 of them were unique to it (Fig. 1b). There are a total of 1970 unique genes from the  curated gene list which are commonly encountered across insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling pathways. Most of the genes from the  list related to insulin resistance, insulin signaling, and estrogen signaling were downregulated in the liver (Fig. 1c). In total, 645 out of the 1970 unique genes from the  resource had gene expression values across all nine tissues. These genes were divided into seven biologically relevant clusters associated with insulin resistance and signaling (Fig. 1d). In particular, the last cluster (cluster 7) at the bottom of the heatmap were related to Gene Ontology (GO) processes30 such as lipid localization and glycerolipid metabolic processes which are related to obesity which in turn can lead to a decrease in insulin sensitivity31 (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Hierarchical clustering of genes shows clusters being related to GO biological processes relevant to insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling (Fig. S1). e Venn diagram of insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling pathways with their corresponding unique and overlapping genes from the  curated gene list. There are a total of 145 genes that are common across all three pathways.In general, two genes were differentially expressed (i.e., upregulated) across all tissues in the RR-1 samples; ARNTL and NPAS2. Across skeletal muscles, 21 DEGs were commonly encountered, out of which 11 DEGs were upregulated and 9 DEGs were downregulated. UCKL1OS was only upregulated in soleus. Many of them were related to the circadian clock, such as NR1D2, NPAS2, PER2, PER3, CIART, DBP, ARNTL, and SOX4. In terms of insulin signaling linked genes, in muscles, ARNTL, MT1, SOX4 were upregulated and DBP and PER2 were downregulated. The genes associated with circadian rhythm, indicates the global effect of spaceflight on the circadian clock and its association with insulin signaling. Overall, from our analysis, the liver was the most impacted organ by spaceflight, with the highest number of DEGs, alongside insulin and estrogen receptor signaling predicted to be inhibited (z-scores: −3.772 and −5.859, respectively).Common insulin and estrogen signaling genes altered by spaceflight in female rodents To determine if there are any universally shared insulin and estrogen pathways being regulated throughout the different organs during spaceflight, we performed further analysis on the 145 shared genes linked to insulin and estrogen signaling as well as insulin resistance (Fig. 1e). 56 out of 145 common genes across the insulin resistance and insulin signaling pathways had gene expression values across all nine tissues. The genes were clustered into three clusters where the top enriched pathways from GO processes were: triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle remodeling for cluster 1, positive regulation of insulin secretion for cluster 2, and carbohydrate homeostasis for cluster 3 (Fig. 2a). The disease enrichment analysis revealed that 62 out of 145 genes were associated with diseases, with the top enriched disease being diabetes mellitus, followed by fatty liver (Fig. 2b). Human genes at the intersection of these pathways were used in a similar manner, and the top enriched disease was obesity, followed by hypertension (Fig. 2c). Thus, enriched diseases in both species emphasize the importance of insulin and estrogen signaling in metabolic diseases. Fig. 2. Insulin resistance, insulin and estrogen signaling related genes and diseases. Open in a new tab a Heatmap for 56 out of 145 common genes across the insulin resistance and insulin signaling pathways for which there were gene expression values across all nine tissues. b Disease enrichment plot showing top 10 diseases from mouse genome database (MGD) being enriched using 145 unique genes common across insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling. The y axis shows the disease labels and the x axis shows the ratio of disease relevant genes to the total number of genes found from the 145 genes that were present in MGD. The dots in the enrichment plots are colored by the FDR values and the sizes of the dots indicate the number of genes found to be enriched for a disease. Diabetes and fatty liver are the top two enriched diseases which are related to estrogen and insulin signaling. c Disease enrichment plot is shown with top 10 diseases from human curated sources (e.g., UniProt, ClinGen) using species relevant genes out of 145 genes from the  list. Obesity and fatty liver are the top two enriched diseases which are also related to estrogen and insulin signaling.Further pathway analysis utilizing gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), focused on specific insulin and estrogen pathways, demonstrated differences in the enrichment of gene sets across organs (Fig. 3a). The majority of gene sets related to insulin and insulin resistance were predicted to be inhibited in the liver (OSD-168) such as insulin receptor signaling pathway, response to troglitazone and adipogenesis (Fig. 3a). Kidney (OSD-102) and eye (OSD-100) also showed similar inhibition for insulin pathways, such as insulin pathway, insulin receptor signaling pathway, response to insulin (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, a set of muscle tissues (i.e. tibialis anterior (OSD-105) and EDL (OSD-99)) were shown to be activated for response to insulin, while the quadriceps (OSD-103) and gastrocnemius (OSD-101) showed negative enrichment scores for response to insulin (Fig. 3a). It is known that during spaceflight the soleus muscle is impacted first with muscle mass loss which can lead to downstream dysregulation related to metabolic, inflammatory, and immune functions32. Fig. 3. Gene set enrichment analysis of insulin and estrogen pathways. Open in a new tab a A heatmap of the normalized enrichment scores (NES) of estrogen and insulin pathways impacted by spaceflight in datasets of RR-1 mission samples. The dark gray locations in the heatmap indicate missing values for the NES, resulting from off-range adjusted p-values (padj) at which the NES is obtained. The assumed range is padj < 0.3. A positive NES indicates activation of the pathways, while at negative NES the pathway is inhibited. In the pathways, the full meaning of CRGS is ‘Cellular Response to Glucose Stimulus’; and the full meaning of IERSP is ‘Intracellular Estrogen Receptor Signaling Pathway’. The pathways are categorized into several types, and the MSigDB database from which the pathway is sourced is indicated in parentheses. b A heatmap of the t-score of the overlapping leading-edge pathway genes across the datasets of the RR-1 mission samples. The dark gray locations in the heatmap indicate the absence of a value for the t-score, resulting from off-range adjusted p-values (padj) at which the t-score is obtained. The assumed range is padj < 0.05. The leading-edge genes are the genes that contribute to the GSEA predicted pathways. The overlapping leading-edge genes are commonly leading-edge genes to at least four of the datasets.Overall, there are similar organ dependent patterns for estrogen-specific pathways observed (Fig. 3a). Estrogen metabolism and signaling pathways were negatively enriched in the kidney (OSD-102), liver (OSD-168), and quadriceps muscle (OSD-103). Specific estrogen signaling pathways, such as pubertal breast, were negatively enriched in the liver, eye, and adrenal gland, while being positively enriched in the (OSD-99) and tibialis anterior (OSD-105) muscles (Fig. 3a). When analyzing the specific leading-edge genes involved in the insulin and estrogen pathway predictions, we observed that a subset of these genes were related to the circadian rhythm (i.e., ARNTL, CLOCK, CRY2, PER3, NFIL3, and NR1D2) (Fig. 3b). The majority of these gene expressions were in the same direction across organs; however, some unique differences were observed. PFKM was upregulated only in the soleus muscle (OSD-104) (Fig. 3b).Gene expression changes and proteomics suggest underlying insulin resistance in spaceflight-induced hepatosteatosis Notably, the liver is a key metabolic organ that orchestrates and regulates a plethora of metabolic pathways, including estrogen and insulin signaling33. During spaceflight, the liver RNA-seq data exhibits the most pronounced and unique impact on metabolic pathways as well as insulin and estrogen signaling. A comprehensive analysis of liver samples harvested after 37 days of spaceflight, revealed that both insulin and estrogen receptor signaling are predicted to be inhibited in the liver during spaceflight, as compared to ground controls (z-scores: −3.772 and −5.859, respectively). Our findings indicate that several genes of the insulin signaling pathway denoted development of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis (z-scores: 2.481 and 3.737, respectively). Furthermore, insulin receptor was downregulated in the liver during spaceflight, along with inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which may indicate derangement of mitochondrial activity. In addition, disruption of estrogen signaling has been extensively reported to aggravate hepatic insulin resistance33,34. According to this evidence, our analysis showed inhibition of estrogen receptor signaling in the liver during spaceflight (z-score: −5.859). Remarkably, genes associated with mitochondrial complex I, complex II, and ATP synthase were downregulated in the estrogen signaling network (Fig. 4a). This is particularly relevant considering that estrogen receptors play a key role in mitochondrial activity and biogenesis35–37. In livers harvested from mice after spaceflight, we observed impairment of estrogen signaling, which in turn may hamper oxidative phosphorylation by mainly affecting complex I (Fig. 4a)38. Fig. 4. Hepatic steatosis in mice liver. Open in a new tab a The hepatic steatosis canonical pathway with the significantly regulated genes for liver tissue from mice flown to space compared to ground control mice. The lower panel is the mitochondrial complexes and the significantly regulated genes involved visualized by ShinyGo v0.76.3 and KEGG pathway diagrams. The boxes highlighted in yellow indicate genes related to estrogen receptor signaling. Panel was created in BioRender. b Lollipop plot illustrating the normalized enrichment scores (NES) of hepatic steatosis pathways in OSD-168 (liver tissue). Only pathways with a NES obtained at an adjusted p-value <0.3 (padj < 0.3) are shown. c An illustration of common leading-edge genes across pathways of insulin and estrogen in a heatmap of the normalized enrichment scores (NES) of the pathways impacted by spaceflight in OSD-168 (liver tissue). Only pathways with NES at padj < 0.3 are shown, and only genes that are among leading edge genes seven (7) or more of the pathways are shown.Specific analysis of pathways related to hepatic steatosis (Fig. 4b, c) revealed that the SREBP pathway was one of the top positively enriched pathways (Fig. 4b). This pathway is known to be involved in metabolic-associated chronic liver diseases such as Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)39. Furthermore, response to insulin and insulin signaling pathways were universally enriched in hepatic steatosis during spaceflight, with insulin receptor (INSR) and downstream targets (i.e IRS1, AKT1, AKT2) among the top enriched genes for hepatic steatosis (Fig. 4c). Among the top leading genes, we additionally identified MFN2, which encodes for Mitofusin 2, a mitochondrial fusion protein associated with insulin signaling and oxidative stress in NAFLD40,41. In summary, our findings suggest that during spaceflight, alterations of insulin and estrogen signaling may lead to the development of hepatic steatosis. We also performed proteomics analysis using RR-1 data, which revealed that the liver displayed the most insulin and estrogen-related protein abundance changes (Fig. 5a). In the liver, proteins involved in lipid metabolism such as hormone sensitive lipase, Apoe, Sphk2 and Ldlr, showed notable changes in protein abundance. These proteins are also linked to insulin signaling, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolism disorder (Fig. 5b–e). Lipe encodes hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) which hydrolyses lipids (i.e. triacylglycerols) in various tissues. Insulin inhibits HSL activity while counteracting hormones such as glucocorticoids, glucagon, and catecholamines activate HSL during stress or starvation42. Increased ApoE protein abundance was observed in the kidney, adrenal gland, and significantly in the liver (Fig. 5c, d). Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is one of the major lipoproteins in the cholesterol metabolism and it uptakes VLDL, IDL and chylomicron remnants from the circulation. It is also a major ligand for the LDL receptor. There was a significant increase in the abundance of LDL receptors in the liver, while it decreased in the adrenal gland (Fig. 5c–e). In terms of estrogen signaling related proteins, we observed changes in protein abundance associated with mitochondrial complexes (Fig. 5f). This was observed mostly in muscles, and the majority of these mitochondrial proteins belong to NADH dehydrogenases in complex I (i.e. NDUFA5 encodes a subunit of complex I) (Fig. 5f). Fig. 5. Quantitative proteomics screening of different tissues from the RR1 mission samples. Open in a new tab a Heatmaps for logFC (Flight vs. Ground) of proteins across the estrogen signaling, insulin signaling, and insulin resistance pathways. Normalized protein intensity values were used to calculate the logFC through the Limma package. Columns represent datasets from different tissues in the RR1 missions, and rows correspond to proteins. The gray cells in the heatmap indicate missing values. Asterisks (*) overlaying cells denote statistical significance (p-value < 0.05). Liver displayed the most protein abundance changes across these pathways. Protein abundance changes for (b) insulin receptor signaling, (c) insulin resistance, (d) hepatic steatosis, (e) glucose metabolism disorders, and (f) estrogen receptor signaling, were also depicted in different heatmaps. All 0 values for b–f are for proteins which were not present in the data.Alterations in insulin and estrogen linked genes in the rodent skin Both insulin and estrogen act in the skin and contribute to important functions such as wound healing and skin integrity. Further, certain skin conditions have been associated with insulin resistance (i.e., acanthosis nigricans)43. Thus, we utilized rodent data sets (RR-5, RR-7, MHU-2) to analyze skin gene expressions linked to insulin resistance, insulin, and estrogen signaling. We observed differences in pathway enrichment scores between female and male mice (Fig. 6a). During the first 25 days of flight, estrogen and insulin signaling, as well as insulin resistance pathways, were negatively enriched in the skin of female C3H mice; however, these pathways were positively enriched during the 75 days of flight (Fig. 6a). We also noted similarities and differences across strains. Within the same mission (RR-7), pathway enrichments in C3H mice varied based on flight duration, while the insulin resistance pathway was positively enriched in C57BL mice regardless of flight duration (Fig. 6a). The insulin resistance pathway was positively enriched during 75 days of flight in two different strains (Fig. 6a). Further, in female mice, the insulin resistance pathway was positively enriched in various strains and different missions, except in C3H strains exposed to 25 days of flight (Fig. 6a). In the skin of male mice, differences in enrichment scores were observed based on the tissue (dorsal vs femoral skin) and diet (Fig. 6a). Fig. 6. Insulin and estrogen signaling, insulin resistance pathways in skin rodent samples. Open in a new tab a Pathway enrichment heatmap.

Columns represent pathways, while rows represent datasets from multiple spaceflight missions, split by biological sex. Asterisks (*) overlaying cells denote statistical significance. b Gene-level heatmaps (one for each pathway). Heatmap of t-scores for highly significant (FDR ≤ 0.01) differentially expressed genes associated with the insulin and estrogen signaling as well as insulin resistance. Columns represent datasets from multiple spaceflight missions, and rows correspond to genes. Asterisks (*) overlaying cells denote statistical significance; genes must be significant in at least one of the datasets to be displayed.In female and male rodent skin samples, we found differences in gene expressions related to insulin and estrogen signaling (Fig. 6b). Most of the significant up- and downregulations were observed in the male mice, especially in the dorsal skin (Fig. 6B). Certain genes involved in tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix, wound healing, and collagen synthesis (i.e., ACE, FN1, IGFBP5, MMP3, COL6A3, COL6A1, COL1A1, COL5A1, BGN, FASN, LOXL2) were downregulated only in male mice (Fig. 6b). FN1 encodes fibronectin which is an essential component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and participates in cell migration, adhesion, and wound repair44. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in tissue remodeling; MMP3 regulates the rate of wound healing and was downregulated in the skin of male mice45. Further, epidermal lipids contribute to the skin’s barrier function46. Fatty acids can be synthesized in the epidermis, and FASN encodes fatty acid synthase, which was downregulated in male mice. Insulin receptor (INSR), IRS2, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and ESRRG were upregulated in male mice dorsal skin (Fig. 6b). Estrogen promotes skin and mucosa epithelialization47,48. Sex differences may play a role in wound healing and variations in healing rates have been reported in literature49,50. In female mice, S100s9, Nr4a2, Nr4a3, Il6, and Egf2 were significantly downregulated only in the skin of C3H mice during 25 days of flight (Fig. 6b). Although we noticed some changes in the pathway enrichment scores, results need to be interpreted carefully, due to differences in missions, durations, strains, housing, and diet.Changes in insulin signaling genes and pathways conserved in astronauts To explore if insulin and estrogen signaling-related genes are affected in astronauts during spaceflight, human samples were used to map genes of interest. We utilized astronaut data from the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study mission51 with astronauts in space for 120 days. Specifically, for the JAXA mission RNA-seq was conducted on plasma cell-free RNAs (cfRNAs) from 6 astronauts that were on the International Space Station (ISS) for 120 days from pre-flight, during flight, and post flight time points. Insulin signaling linked genes are dysregulated during and after spaceflight in astronauts (Fig. 7a). Some genes were specifically upregulated within the first month upon return (R + 3d, R + 30d) such as AVP, FFAR4, GLP1R, RIMS2, FGF6, NR1H4, PRLH, CPE, and APOM. The FFAR4 encodes free fatty acid receptor 4, is widely expressed in tissues and has been associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases52. The GLP1R is another key gene encoding glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor which stimulates insulin secretion (Fig. 7a). Additionally, insulin secretion was among the enriched pathways (Fig. 7a). GLP-1 receptor agonist is currently used in the treatment of diabetes and obesity53. Fig. 7. Insulin Signaling linked genes and pathways from JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE). Open in a new tab a Heatmap of the significantly upregulated genes compared to pre-flight for either flight or post-flight of normalized plasma cell-free RNA expression values and associated pathways for insulin signaling over time for the six astronauts over 120 days in space from JAXA study. The values shown on are the averaged normalized expression values for all six astronauts each time point during flight and post-flight. The four pre-flight time points were averaged together, since the changes for genes in the time leading up to flight are considered to be the same and part of the baseline values. For the time, L = Launch (i.e., meaning time after launch from Earth and length in space) and R = Return to Earth. Based on heatmap, pathway analysis performed using ShinyGO to reveal the top 30 pathways (FDR < 0.05) being regulated for postflight upregulated insulin linked genes.

The pathways and lollipop plots demonstrate top 30 pathways (based on FDR). The red bold font texts are the pathways that are directly known to regulate the insulin pathway in the pathway figure.Certain genes involved in insulin signaling were upregulated throughout the postflight period. MAF is a transcription factor that is known to regulate and activate insulin gene expression54 (Fig. 7a). Similarly, RARRES2, which encodes chemerin, was also upregulated throughout postflight. Chemerin is an adipokine that is associated with insulin resistance and obesity55. AKT1 is the main downstream of insulin signaling and was upregulated during postflight which also correlates with the postflight PI3K/AKT enrichment (Fig. 7a). CRH, GCGR, and SLC2A3 are other important genes related to endocrine hormones and insulin. The glucagon receptor, encoded by GCGR, is the primary receptor for glucagon. Glucagon counteracts the actions of insulin and has a role in stress response56. The GCGR was upregulated throughout the entire postflight period (Fig. 7b). SLC2A3 encodes for a glucose transporter named GLUT3 and is widely expressed in various cells. SLC2A3 was downregulated upon return from spaceflight (Fig. 7b). The cholesterol metabolism was the top activated pathway for postflight upregulated genes involved in insulin signaling (Fig. 7a). Insulin secretion, regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, Cushing syndrome, and circadian entrainment were other enriched pathways (Fig. 7a). Glucagon signaling was the top activated pathway for downregulated genes associated with insulin signaling (Fig. 7b). Insulin resistance, lipid and atherosclerosis, AMPK signaling, oxytocin signaling and viral infection related pathways (i.e., HPV, CMV infections, HTLV1) were other enriched pathways (Fig. 7b). The MS4A1 gene encodes CD20, a B-cell marker, and it was downregulated during postflight but upregulated during flight (Fig. 7b). Further, some of the gene expressions changed at specific time points. Interestingly, CRP was upregulated upon return (R + 3d) and was downregulated a month later (R + 30d) (Fig. 7a). Follow-up samples showed upregulation of CRP on the second and third months postflight (Fig. 7a). CRP is also linked to estrogen signaling and insulin resistance (Figs. 8a, 9a). This is important as the CRP gene encodes c-reactive protein, which is an inflammatory marker. Elevated CRP levels correlate with both fasting insulin and insulin resistance parameters (i.e. HOMA-IR)57. Fig. 8. Insulin Resistant linked genes and pathways from JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE).

The red bold font texts are the pathways that are directly known to regulate the estrogen signaling pathway in the pathway figure.Insulin Resistance related genes and pathways during and after spaceflight The majority of insulin signaling related genes and their alterations could result in insulin resistance which would be a great concern during long-term spaceflight. AKT1 was upregulated and AKT3 was downregulated throughout the postflight period (Fig. 8a, b). AKT1 and AKT3 are members of serine/threonine kinases and are downstream of insulin signaling. Insulin resistance can be seen with hormonal dysfunctions like acromegaly, hyperaldosteronism, and Cushing disease58. Aldosterone is responsible for fluid and sodium balance and CYP11B2, and encodes aldosterone synthase, which was upregulated within the first week upon return from spaceflight (R + 3d) (Fig. 8a), a period that overlaps with intravascular fluid changes upon return. Other genes associated with insulin resistance are MT-ND1 and MT-ND6. MT-ND1, and MT-ND6 genes encode subunits of NADH dehydrogenase in mitochondria complex I. Both genes were upregulated during spaceflight (Fig. 8a, b). Mitochondria are the center of many biochemical pathways, and one of them is fatty acid oxidation where insulin and estrogen exert their effects. CD36 and CPT1A are other key genes in fatty acid metabolism and were upregulated during the various phases of spaceflight (Fig. 8b). The CD36 is responsible for fatty acid uptake into cells and is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. LEPR, APP, CXCL5, LYPLAL1, GHL3 are other upregulated insulin resistance related genes during flight (Fig. 8b). In the pathway analysis, postflight upregulated genes linked to insulin resistance, showed enrichment of endocrine resistance, estrogen signaling, cholesterol metabolism, regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) pathways (Fig. 8a). Downregulated genes in flight or postflight vs preflight are given in Fig. 8b. There was a trend of upregulation of these genes during spaceflight (Fig. 8b). These genes showed enriched pathways of insulin resistance, type II diabetes mellitus, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications and diabetic cardiomyopathy (Fig. 8b). The genes involved in insulin signaling and resistance from human data revolve around key cellular metabolic events such as lipid metabolism, viral infection pathways, and estrogen signaling. The endocrine-metabolic signature observed here illustrates the prominence of regulation of action of insulin during and after spaceflight. Additionally, there is a prominent immune-mediated cytokine and adipokine response to spaceflight in humans. This corroborates growth inducing actions of insulin via the prominent PI3K/Akt and the Ras/MAPK pathways.Estrogen signaling related genes and their pathways during and after spaceflight ESR1 encodes Estrogen Receptor 1 (Estrogen Receptor alpha), the primary receptor for estrogens, which is widely expressed in both rodents and humans. Estrogen signaling via this receptor can alter energy metabolism and conversely, gonadal estrogen production is regulated by the state of energy. ESR1-regulated pathways include insulin signaling, insulin resistance, leptin signaling, and fatty acid synthesis. ESR1 was upregulated within 2 months (R + 3d, R + 30d, R + 60d) and then downregulated again in the 3rd month (R + 120d) postflight (Fig. 9a). A similar trend during postflight was observed for PER1 expressions (Fig. 9a). PER1 encodes Per1 protein, which is one of the major components of circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythm and circadian clock genes are closely related to metabolism and hormones. CYP17A1 was upregulated during postflight, which encodes a key enzyme in steroidogenesis for cortisol and sex steroid synthesis (Fig. 9a). Estrogen-related genes altered postflight, with most being upregulated throughout the postflight period (Fig. 9a), included ZNF423, GAL, EGFR, FST, PAX2, SLC34A1, GREB1, F5, FGF23, AKT1 and NOS1. These genes are also implicated in the constitutive PIK3CA signaling pathway and myogenesis. This could be a direct effect of spaceflight-induced physical stress as nuclear-initiated estrogen signaling (NICE) can induce corticotropin-releasing hormone CRH through the induction of nitric oxide (NOS1 upregulation) and via PI3K signaling activation59. Similarly, selected genes CRHR2, PRKCD, TRIM24, IL6ST, MALAT1, OXTR, INPP4B, KMT2C, LEPR, and TAB2 within the downregulated cohort revealing a consistent pattern of change with spaceflight represent a niche of interleukin 6/JAK/STAT3 and MAPK signaling. Estrogen-linked upregulated genes at postflight showed that steroid hormone biosynthesis was the top activated pathway (Fig. 9a). Other enriched pathways were ovarian steroidogenesis, estrogen signaling, Cushing syndrome, and retinol metabolism in favor of stress response and sex steroid synthesis. Estrogen-linked downregulated genes and their associated pathways showed activation of insulin resistance, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, lipid and atherosclerosis, and growth hormone synthesis pathways (Fig. 9b). Estrogen also has a role in immunity, and enrichment of viral infection pathways like CMV, HTLV1 and HPV infections are also detected (Fig. 9b).Intricate dance of insulin and estrogen signaling and insulin resistance Some of the genes in the human samples were related to both insulin and estrogen signaling as well as insulin resistance including IGFBP1, FGF23, WNT5A, CRP, ESR1, EGFR, FST, NCOR1, CD36, CYP17A1, SHBG, KISS1, LEPR. The leptin receptor (LEPR) and its signaling are crucial for metabolism and obesity31. LEPR was downregulated upon return from spaceflight, regardless of the time interval (Figs. 7b, 8b, and 9b). The CYP17A1 gene was upregulated upon return (Fig. 7a). CYP17A1, encodes steroidogenic enzymes, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, and 17,20 lyase. These enzymes are responsible for the production of cortisol, estrogen and androgens, and their deficiencies have been linked to both hormonal imbalance and metabolic dysfunction such as hypertension. Most hormones bind to proteins in the circulation. Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) binds sex steroid hormones (estrogen and testosterone), and because of this interaction, the amount of SHBG is important as decreasing SHBG levels may lead to increasing free testosterone and estradiol levels, and vice versa. SHGB was upregulated 1 month upon return (R + 30d) and downregulated at the 3rd month (Figs. 7a, 8a, and 9a). Overlapping pathways were also observed such as PI3K-Akt signaling, cAMP signaling, insulin resistance, and estrogen signaling. It is well known that changes in estrogen signaling have been associated with insulin resistance60, as seen in our results showing the enrichment of the estrogen signaling pathway via insulin resistance linked genes. Viral infection related pathways are enriched with both insulin and estrogen downregulated genes (Figs. 7b and 9b).Insulin and estrogen signaling changes are observed in multiple human missions To explore if sex differently impacted insulin signaling, estrogen signaling, and insulin resistance, we utilized astronaut data (2 female and 2 male) from the first civilian commercial 3-day space mission, referred to as Inspiration4 (i4)61. From the i4 mission, single-cell gene expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and skin spatial transcriptomics data were generated. Genes in the estrogen signaling, insulin signaling, and insulin resistance overlapped less than 10% with DEGs at R + 1 from PBMCs and subpopulations (CD4 T, CD8 T, other T, B, NK, CD14 Mono, CD16 Mono, DC) (Fig. 10a). Among these overlapping genes, the percentage of the upregulated genes were higher than downregulated genes (Fig. 10a). Log2 Female DEGs to Male DEGs ratios varied across cell types, based on insulin and estrogen linked gene categories. Log2 Female DEGs to Male DEGs ratios were positive in most cell types for insulin signaling (i.e. PBMCs, CD4 T, CD8 T, NK, DC, and ‘other’ subpopulations) (Fig. 10b). Certain cell types showed either a positive or negative ratio, depending on the hormone of interest. For instance, in females, in terms of DC, the DEGs ratio was positive for insulin-linked genes, but negative for estrogen-linked genes. In estrogen signaling, downregulated genes of B and other cell types were higher in females (Fig. 10b). In CD4 T cells, the ratios were positive in insulin, estrogen signaling and IR linked genes (Fig. 10b). We also calculated insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, and insulin signaling scores to track the changes over spaceflight. Higher enrichment scores were observed in all signaling pathways on R + 82, in comparison to R + 1 (Fig. 10c). In general, there was not a strong sex difference across cells (Fig. 10c). In certain cell types, differences in enrichment scores were observed depending on mission timeline and sex (Fig. 10c). In dendritic cells (DC), three pathways were positively enriched on R + 82 in both sexes; however, enrichment scores were different among females and males on R + 45 (Fig. 10c). T cell metabolism is modulated through insulin receptor signaling during inflammation and infection62. Alternatively, energy consumption due to T cell activation drives upregulation of insulin receptors63. Therefore, it is evident that insulin signaling is a key immune-metabolic event during increased physiologic demands, as in i4 cohort findings. Similarly, estrogen receptor alpha is known to mediate T cell-dependent inflammatory reactions in a diseased state12. Fig. 10.

Open in a new tab a Percent overlap of genes associated with insulin and estrogen signaling in single cell RNA-seq PBMC data, by cell types. b Log2 Female to male gene ratios from panel c. Fold changes of enrichment scores in response to spaceflight by sex, postflight collection time points, and cell types, PBMC data. The color scale bar represents fold change values are relative to pre-flight. d Fold changes of enrichment scores in postflight relative to preflight time point, by sex and tissue compartments (OE outer epidermis, IE inner epidermis, OD outer dermis, VA vasculature) in skin biopsy data. The color scale bar represents fold change values.We also compared these findings in human skin data. To perform spatial transcriptomics analysis, we compared transcript profiles of preflight (L-44) and postflight (R + 1) tissue sections across four compartments within the skin, including outer epidermis (OE), inner epidermis (IE), outer dermis (OD) and vasculature (VA). While statistical analysis is limited by small sample sizes, we found slight differences between male and female skin compartments. Using the ssGSEA approach, overall, we observed increased enrichments in insulin resistance genes and decreased enrichments in estrogen and insulin signaling genes. There were slight sex differences, and the degrees of variation were region-specific. For example, we saw the strongest loss and sex-dependent variation of estrogen and insulin signaling signatures in VA regions (Fig. 10d). Insulin resistance linked genes were more enriched in females in the postflight vascular compartment and outer epidermis relative to preflight samples. In inner epidermis, both insulin and estrogen-signaling-linked genes showed larger changes in enrichments in females than in males.Discussion Consistent with past reports that insulin signaling is a central regulator of gene expression changes and lipid metabolism in response to spaceflight in the worm, C. elegans64,65, we find that gene expression changes related to insulin signaling occur in spaceflown rodents and humans. Further, we find that estrogen signaling gene expression changes also occur in both spaceflown rodents and humans. In mice, the liver and soleus muscle were the tissues that displayed the largest changes in global gene expression (Fig. 1b). These tissues also displayed large changes in insulin and estrogen signaling gene expression (Fig. 1c, d). In the liver, insulin receptor (INSR) and downstream kinases AKT1 and AKT2 were downregulated during spaceflight. These changes were accompanied by decreased expression of other insulin receptor signaling genes. The metabolic pathways directly controlled by insulin were inhibited, which resulted in activation of dysglycemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. This last prediction is particularly striking given the increase in liver mass in these mice in a prior study utilizing the same cohort66. Hepatic steatosis is a direct consequence of insulin resistance and can in turn exacerbate insulin resistance, leading to the development of a metabolic syndrome, and thus resulting in a vicious cycle67. Prior studies have reported that during spaceflight, mice developed hepatomegaly66 and hepatic lipid accumulation68,69. Further, the livers used in our analysis showed histologic evidence of lipid accumulation via Oil Red O staining in a prior study68. Thus, our results suggest that disrupted insulin signaling may underlie these changes. In addition to the insulin signaling changes, the impaired estrogen signaling we observed (z-score < −2), may contribute to hepatic insulin resistance. In rodents, both male and female estrogen receptor knockout mice display insulin resistance15. Further, both insulin and estrogen actively play a role in metabolism and our findings also suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction, previously reported during spaceflight2, may be due to alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling (Fig. 4a). PGC-1α, encoded by PPARGA1A, is a master regulator in metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis70. PPARGC1A downregulation in the liver was observed in both insulin and estrogen gene expression changes. Additionally, estrogen regulates mitochondrial function and biogenesis35–37. In our liver data, downregulation of mitochondrial complex I, complex 2, and ATP synthase genes were observed in the estrogen signaling network (Fig. 4a). Thus, alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling in the liver may contribute to whole body alterations in metabolism in response to spaceflight. Soleus muscle was the second most affected tissue in mouse studies. Soleus is a slow twitch (type I) muscle fiber, dense in mitochondria to provide sustained oxidative capacity for long-term demands. Prior studies show atrophy in the soleus muscle after spaceflight in both rodents and humans66, and differential gene expressions between soleus and EDL muscle in rodents71. Myostatin (MSTN) controls muscle mass and has been reported to be upregulated in microgravity in the soleus muscle but not in EDL72; we confirm this observation. Other muscle atrophy related genes, FBX032 (Atrogin-1) and TRIM63, and mechanoreceptor PIEZO1 were also downregulated in the soleus. The downregulation of FBX032 and TRIM63 suggest the decline in soleus muscle size66 is not caused by increases in muscle protein degradation. This is consistent with past reports that muscle protein degradation is not increased in flight, but rather that protein synthesis declines73. Previous studies in astronauts have suggested that altered insulin signaling may underlie muscle atrophy25. Further, in a prior study from the same mission, mice soleus muscle weight was decreased by 19%, despite no change in body weight and being physically active in space66. Given that insulin promotes protein synthesis, our finding of decreased expression in soleus of IRS2 (Insulin receptor substrate 2), one of major downstream insulin signaling, suggests that insulin alterations contribute to declines in protein synthesis to promote muscle atrophy in flight; this is also consistent with suggestions from spaceflown C. elegans65. On the contrary, insulin receptor signaling was activated in the EDL (z-score: 2.52). Moreover, insulin-induced ACACA, a rate-limiting enzyme in lipogenesis, was upregulated indicating an insulin responsive state in the EDL. Further, the majority of the insulin signaling significant genes at the intersection of soleus and EDL were regulated in opposite directions, which shows distinctive insulin response in these muscles (Supplementary Data 1). Estrogen also promotes muscle growth, regeneration, insulin sensitivity, and controls muscle inflammation14,74. Estrogen-related receptor beta and gamma (ESRRB, ESRRG) induce mitochondrial function in myotubes and have a role in shifting muscle fibers towards oxidative types75. Muscle-specific ESR1 knockout mice models showed decreased oxidative metabolism, impaired mitochondrial fission and glucose metabolism76. Thus, our findings that ESR1 receptor was upregulated and ESRRB and ESRRG were downregulated in soleus, while ESRRA, ESRRB, ESRRG were all upregulated in the EDL, suggest diverse actions of estrogen in muscle metabolism during spaceflight. Interestingly, while soleus size declined and EDL remained stable, as consistent with past studies66, the gene expression changes in soleus and EDL were distinct with EDL displaying an enrichment for growth pathways (Fig. 3), also consistent with prior studies71. Estrogen receptor signaling pathways were activated in both EDL and soleus muscles. Soleus muscle mass recovery is reported to be slower after hindlimb suspension in ovariectomized mice77. Additionally, increased estrogen receptor expressions were reported following muscle trauma in regenerating myofibers74. Thus, estrogen receptor signaling activation and upregulation of ESR1 could be a compensatory mechanism against muscle disuse in the soleus muscle, whereas, in EDL the ESR signaling activation could support muscle growth and energy metabolism. Adipose tissue is another endocrine organ which is a part of cross-talk between muscle and liver. Our results are limited to muscle and liver, as adipose tissue was not available for analysis. Studies in humans have more constraints than in model organisms, thus for the present study we were limited to blood samples and skin in spaceflown humans. However, as insulin and estrogen are circulating hormones, changes in their effects should be detected in these tissues; albeit at lower levels such as in the non-liver and non-soleus tissues in rodents (Fig. 1). As with the worm and rodent data, changes in insulin resistance related genes were detected inflight and postflight. Postflight samples from human subjects displayed upregulated insulin signaling genes (i.e., AKT1, RARRES2) as well as enriched insulin secretion and PI3K/AKT signaling (Fig. 8a), possibly suggesting decline in these pathways inflight. Additionally, postflight upregulation of the glucagon signaling pathway may indicate underlying postflight stress and may result in insulin resistance. Overall, postflight up- and down-regulated genes associated with insulin signaling displayed enriched lipid metabolism, hormones (i.e., estrogen, growth hormone, glucagon), circadian rhythm, and immune system pathways. Also, in the human data, we found the estrogen signaling pathway was enriched with insulin related genes. ESR1 was upregulated within 2 months (R + 3d, R + 30d, R + 60d) and then downregulated in the 3rd month (R + 120d). In correlation with this finding CYP17A1 was upregulated postflight. These findings may explain the enriched ovarian steroidogenesis and steroid hormone synthesis pathways seen postflight. Estrogen is closely related to the immune system, as an example, Treg cell distribution changes during menstrual cycles and increases during the follicular phase78. In our data, dendritic cells in females showed higher enrichment scores in estrogen and insulin linked genes on R + 45 than male counterparts (Fig. 10c). Sex difference was also observed in both rodent and human skin samples. In human skin, in the vascular region (VA) of the dermis, insulin resistance-related genes were more enriched in females during postflight while insulin and estrogen signaling-related genes were less enriched (Fig. 10d). In rodent skin samples, certain genes associated with tissue remodeling and collagen synthesis (i.e. COL1A1, COL6A3, COL6A1, COL5A1) (Fig. 6b) were downregulated in male mice (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, increased urinary COL1A1 and COL3A1 levels have been reported in the NASA twin study79. Insulin and estrogen both play an active role in skin homeostasis, and insulin resistance has been linked to certain skin conditions43. Dermis is a connective tissue rich in vasculature, fibroblasts, collagen and elastic fibers, glands, hair follicles, and nerve endings. Both insulin and estrogen signaling exist in vascular endothelium and cause vasodilation via nitric oxide80,81. Insulin-resistant states could impair vascular endothelium82,83. Estrogen promotes skin and mucosal epithelialization and proliferation. Studies reported positive impact of estrogen in wound healing84. Clinically, topical estrogen is used in the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy, and it proliferates epithelium48. Although our findings are limited by sample size, differences in the enrichment scores based on sex and skin compartments warrant future research on skin conditions after spaceflight in a sex and hormone-dependent manner. Further, due to our study setting, we cannot conclude on certain space-related environmental factors, such as lunar soil and dust, and their effects on insulin and estrogen signaling in the skin. In conclusion, we find insulin and estrogen signaling are altered during and after spaceflight in rodents and people. These changes impact metabolism and forebode comorbidities. One advantage of the rodent data is that genes for pathways of interest were examined in various tissues from the same sample cohort, including mice of the same strain and age. However, a key limitation of our study is the small number of human participants. Future studies should include different rodent strains, more human subjects, and different mission profiles to gain more knowledge on these genes/pathways of interest and expand our results. Particular attention should be paid to the effects on reproductive hormone synthesis and actions, as these impact a wide range of tissues, including bone health, energy metabolism and, of course species survival via reproduction. Personalized healthcare using genomic data is the way of the future for both Earth and beyond85. Therefore, as we progress toward becoming an interplanetary species, further study on reproductive endocrinology and metabolism in space is essential for success.Methods Animal and sample collection All omics data related to mouse samples were obtained from NASA’s GeneLab public omics repository86. The data derived from spaceflight experiments carried out onboard the ISS as part of the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1), RR-5, RR-7, and MHU-2 missions. A description of the experimental design, the corresponding type of tissues, and the data accessed are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. All previous animal experiments and methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines at each principal investigators’ institutions and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use committee (IACUC). A detailed description of the methodology for obtaining tissue samples and processing is available in NASA’s GeneLab platform. For the RR-1 mission, in summary, forty female 12-week-old C57Bl/6 J (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) were selected based on similar body weights for 4 experimental groups (16-week-old at launch, n = 10/group): baseline control, vivarium control, habitat control, and flight. Flight mice were launched onboard the ISS on 21 September 2014. Relevant to this study, the habitat control was placed in the ISS Environmental Simulator at NASA KSC on a 4-day delay to mimic flight temperature, CO2, and humidity conditions on the ISS for the duration of spaceflight. Flight mice were exposed to microgravity for a total of 37 days (33 days on ISS and 4 days in the Dragon Capsule). Mice were euthanized by injection of Euthasol followed by cervical dislocation and immediately fast frozen intact or partially dissected prior to carcasses being frozen in the Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) aboard the ISS. All ground mice were processed similarly. Flight mice carcasses returned to Earth February 2015 and were then maintained along with the control mice frozen at the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) at the Ames Research Center until dissection66. Samples were collected and processed as previously described27,68. Mouse carcasses were removed from −80 °C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15–20 min. Multiple tissues were collected from each carcass. This study was based on the following tissue types, the Adrenal glands (OSD-98), Extensor digitorum longus muscle (OSD-99), Eye (OSD-100), Gastrocnemius muscle (OSD-101), Kidney (OSD-102), Quadriceps Muscle (OSD-103), Soleus muscle (OSD-104), Tibialis anterior muscle (OSD-105), and Liver (OSD-168, OSD-48).RNA sequencing and analysis Protocol for each dataset is available on the GeneLab platform (Table S1). Data validation and quality control was performed with FASTQC and Trim Galore! read alignment to the mouse genome using STAR RNA-seq aligner generation of gene-level expected count data with RSEM87. UpSet plots were generated using the UpSetR package in R. The UpSet plot bars were sorted from the largest number of genes to the smallest number of genes in each intersection set with each set having ≥ 2 genes. Heat maps were created using packages available through R (pheatmap and complexheatmap). Hierarchical clustering was used for the heatmaps where Euclidean distance was used as a distance measure and the complete linkage method was used to find similar clusters. For the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) Pathway Analysis, the Genelab datasets are re-analyzed to produce the t-score. The Differential Expression (DE) analysis is accomplished using DESeq2 version 1.26.088, in R software version 4.1.2. Expected counts from the RSEM step were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. The ensembl IDs of the genes in the DE datasets were annotated to their corresponding gene symbols using the R package biomaRt89,90. The murine skin datasets were analyzed via a similar pipeline available at https://github.com/henrycope/spaceflight-skin-transcriptomics-insulin-estrogen, using R version 4.1.0, DESeq2 version 1.32, and biomaRt version 2.48.3. We performed GSEA on the differentially expressed datasets using fGSEA91 to determine to what extent insulin and estrogen pathways were impacted in spaceflight. Estrogen- and insulin- specific gene pathways were selected using the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)91,92. The latest version MSigDB v2022.1 was used in the pathway search. The keyword “estrogen” was used to identify the estrogen-specific pathways through all database collections and all contributors within the Mus musculus species. Similarly, the keyword “insulin” was used to identify insulin-specific pathways through all contributors and Mus musculus database collections. The outcome of the fGSEA analysis is the normalized enrichment score (NES) of any given pathway, alongside valuable information on the analysis, such as the adjusted p-value, and the leading-edge genes of the pathway. The NES is the enrichment score normalized based on the number of genes in the gene set. It indicates the representation of the pathway genes in the dataset gene list, which is priorly ranked according to the values of the t-score of the genes. A positive NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the top of the gene list, while a negative NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the bottom of the gene list. The plots of normalized enrichment score (NES) of the different pathways for a given dataset are rendered using ggplot293, and the heatmaps across different datasets or different genes are rendered using the ComplexHeatmap R package. We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems) for canonical pathway analysis and subsequent predictions in each tissue with statistically significant genes with a fold-change ≥ 1.2 (and ≤ −1.2) comparing flight conditions versus habitat ground controls (FDR < 0.05 as stated above). Low fold-change has become quite standard when trying to identify genes that are differentially expressed, as low cutoffs are less affected by different data normalization schemes and they are less likely to eliminate key genes operating under very tight level regulation61. IPA was used to predict statistically significant activation or inhibition of canonical pathways using activation Z-score statistics (≥2, activated or ≤−2, inhibited)94.Cell-Free Epigenome JAXA Study plasma cfRNA data Aggregated normalized RNA expression values were shared through NASA’s GeneLab platform with accession number: OSD-53051. Blood samples were collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. cfRNA samples were obtained by purifying total RNA from plasma samples and analyzed by RNA-seq. Mean expression values from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts were used for the analysis in this report. Heatmaps were made for the specific genes on the normalized values per time point using R package pheatmap version 1.0.12.Inspiration 4 (i4) astronaut sample collection Inspiration4 was the world’s first all-civilian mission to orbit Earth. Four civilians, two males and two females, spent three days in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) at 585 km above Earth. The mission launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center on 15 September 2021 and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral on September 18th, 2021. Several human-related experiments were carried out to study the effects of spaceflight on human health and performance in collaboration with SpaceX, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), and Weill Cornell Medicine. The experiments carried out on the Inspiration4 crew-members were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines at the principal investigators’ institutions. Moreover, the different study designs and the corresponding methods to collect and analyze the biological samples were approved by BCM IRB. All biological data derived from the Inspiration4 mission were collected pre and post flights. For this study, only data from blood samples and skin biopsies were used. Pre-flight samples were collected at L-92, L-44, and L-3 days prior to launch to space. Upon return, post-flight samples were collected at R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 days.i4 PBMC Single-cell sequencing and analysis Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC ref. 95. ssGSEA was used to calculate the pathway scores of Insulin Resistance, Estrogen Signaling, Insulin Signaling. Heatmaps are generated by the pheatmap R package.Skin spatial transcriptomics For skin spatial transcriptomics data, 4 mm diameter skin biopsies were obtained from all Inspiration4 crew members, once before flight and as soon as possible after return (L-44 and R + 1). These biopsies were flash frozen and processed with the NanoString GeoMx platform. A 20x scan was used to select 95 freeform regions of interest (ROIs) to guide selection of regions of interest. From immunofluorescence staining, we identified epidermis, dermis (OD), and vasculatures (VA); we subdivided epidermis into outer and inner layers, which corresponded to granular and spinous layer for outer epidermal (OE), and basal layer for inner epidermal (IE). GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI and converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the Q3 normalized count matrix that accounts for factors such as capture area, cellularity, and read quality, the DESeq2 method was used to perform differential expression analysis.Proteomics sample preparation and data processing The specific details of the proteomics method was previously published and can be found on GeneLab’s platform. In brief, after protein homogenization, solubilization, and hydrolysis, resulting peptides were dried and labeled using TMT isobaric tags. The labeled peptides were analyzed on the Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Fusion MS instrument was operated in positive ion data-dependent mode with synchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS3 analysis for reporter ion quantitation. Peptide and protein identification and quantification was performed with MaxQuant (1.6.2.3) using a mouse reference database from Uniprot. Protein groups containing matches to decoys or contaminants were discarded. Subsequently, Internal Reference Scaling (IRS) method was employed to normalize protein intensities between different TMT experiments using common proteins in pooled internal standards. The data was log2 transformed and scaled by subtracting the median for each sample. Limma was employed to determine differentially protein abundance between the flight group versus the ground control. All data was plotted as heatmaps using pheatmap (ver.1.0.12).Statistics and reproducibility All statistics are described throughout the methods. Briefly, for all RNA-seq data we utilized a cutoff of FDR (or adjusted p-value) < 0.05. For pathway analysis (i.e. GSEA analysis) as indicated in the methods we used a FDR < 0.25, which is the recommended statistical cutoff to utilize for GSEA analysis92.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Peer Review File (3MB, pdf) Supplemental Material (232.7KB, pdf) 42003_2023_5213_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (80.9KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1 (13.8KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (2.5MB, pdf) Acknowledgements N.S. was supported by grants from NASA [NSSC22K0250; NSSC22K0278] and acknowledges the support of the Osteopathic Heritage Foundation through funding for the Osteopathic Heritage Foundation Ralph S.

    "abstract": "Abstract Common and rare alleles are now being annotated across millions of human genomes, and omics technologies are increasingly being used to develop health and treatment recommendations. However, these alleles have not yet been systematically characterized relative to aerospace medicine. Here, we review published alleles naturally found in human cohorts that have a likely protective effect, which is linked to decreased cancer risk and improved bone, muscular, and cardiovascular health. Although some technical and ethical challenges remain, research into these protective mechanisms could translate into improved nutrition, exercise, and health recommendations for crew members during deep space missions. Subject terms: Rare variants, Personalized medicine",
    "introduction": "Introduction Humankind has entered a new chapter of deep space exploration, with numerous institutions worldwide publicly aspiring toward a sustainable human presence on the Moon and Mars, which is also broadening the diversity of humans in space. In the past two years, the first person with a prosthetic leg entered space (Inspiration4), and the first person with a physical disability was selected for professional astronaut training by the European Space Agency (ESA). The next few years of spaceflight also feature planned missions to the circumlunar environment after a half-century hiatus, including the first crewed commercial lunar flyby (a team of artists and civilians for the dearMoon project), further broadening the range of people going into space. Moreover, while a steady increase in female space explorers began in 1982, the first mission to land the first woman and person of color on the Moon will finally occur in the Artemis III mission (Fig. 1A), coincident with a broadening of the age ranges (Fig. 1B) and mission durations (Fig. 1C) of the astronauts. Fig. 1. Increasing time and breadth of astronauts. Open in a new tab A The cumulative number of astronauts who have been in space, plotted by the year of their first mission. B Boxplots representing the age of astronauts on their first mission plotted by the decade of their first mission. C Boxplots representing the cumulative amount of time an astronaut spent in space plotted against the number of missions in which they have participated. Blue signifies male and pink signifies female astronauts in all plots. Data was scraped from supercluster.com on September 20th, 2021. Only astronauts who spent time in space and crossed the Kármán line are displayed. Of note, only 24 humans have voyaged into the more hazardous conditions outside low-Earth orbit (LEO), all during the Apollo program. The longest Apollo mission lasted only 12 days, and all adventurers were white men between ages 35 and 47, all of whom had passed rigorous physical fitness tests. Consequently, the objective of sending humankind to unexplored horizons over unmatched timescales evokes critical questions about how the human body will respond to new extremes, as well as how to best protect the health of the broader space-faring population. In the coming decades, public and professional space explorers will likely embark on multi-year missions to the Moon and Mars, and this can lead to a more equitable vision of crewed space exploration. Specifically, the space community can democratize vital aspects of spaceflight, ranging from tailored space suit designs, precision health recommendations, and customized countermeasures1,2. Risks for these crews include radiation-induced cancers, space-induced osteopenia, challenges with pregnancy and child development, and changes for human bodies in Martian- and Lunar-based communities. The same motivations that drive precision healthcare on Earth could be useful for these new populations in space, where molecular data could be employed to guide therapy and mission recommendations. Multipronged countermeasures that are both environmental (such as advanced spacesuits, spacecrafts, and space habitats) and biomedical (such as omics-based nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations) likely represent the best contenders to optimize health across a more inclusive gamut of humanity in space. In this paper, we highlight omics technologies as one potential component toward improving prospective health countermeasures in space2. Omics modeling tools assess multiple biological responses (including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, epitranscriptomics, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics) that can converge into useful solutions for mitigating spaceflight-induced physiological deconditioning. Indeed, omics-based recommendations can be integrated alongside other countermeasures to sustain human health in space, and near real-time health monitoring in space could also one day incorporate omics3. We review an example set of published alleles that appear to be linked to health-protective effects, with relevance both on Earth and in space. Basic research into the protective mechanisms of such alleles may translate into improved therapeutic compound discovery and better-informed nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations, not only for space explorers, but also for those who work in challenging conditions on Earth. We conclude by discussing some of the significant scientific and ethical challenges related to these themes.",

    "results": "Results Growing evidence indicates that spaceflight can elicit a range of stressful and adaptive physiological responses on the human body. Environmental harms like radiation, microgravity, and altered gas composition can jeopardize the health of the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, digestive, nervous, integumentary, and immune systems; increase the risk of cancer, diabetes, and aging traits; and disrupt vision, sleep cycles, and cognitive behavior1. There are a range of known alleles across various health-risk categories (Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 1) that may warrant effective and precision countermeasures to improve the physical fitness of both spaceflight participants and terrestrial humans. Fig. 2. Spaceflight health risk countermeasures. Open in a new tab Examples of health-risk categories that warrant precision countermeasures to improve the physical fitness of both spaceflight participants and terrestrial humankind. From left to right: examples of common spaceflight ailments related to the health-risk category; examples of spaceflight countermeasures related to the health-risk category; examples of terrestrial populations that could benefit from improved precision countermeasures related to the health-risk category.

The human health challenges of crewed LEO, cis-lunar, and interplanetary missions will benefit from the development of countermeasures for optimal crew health and safety, especially for known genes that could confer a strong impact on spaceflight-related risks. Examples of known genes relevant for spaceflight include those related to altered radiation tolerance (TP53), hematopoiesis (EPOR), bone density (LRP5), and immune function (HLA alleles and cytokines)4, although there may be upper limits for adaptation5. As such, even when the mechanism of a phenotype is known, natural evolution with extant alleles may have a limited range for adaptation. Nonetheless, an important role of omics (and other omics modeling, such as organoids)6,7 is to understand risks and mechanisms at a deeper level, so that traditional protective measures (such as spacesuits, exercise equipment, and radiation shielding) can be designed in more informed ways. As a result, comprehensive aerospace healthcare programs in the future would likely integrate both omics information and traditional protective measures. We briefly illustrate this below by focusing on key examples of radiation-induced cancer and space-induced bone demineralization. Example 1: Space-induced radiation syndrome and cancer threat Radiation exposure is one of the predominant health hazards of deep space missions, for both in-flight and long-term, post-flight risks. In-flight concerns include acute radiation sickness (ARS), which may include hair loss, cataracts, metabolic deficiency, and gastrointestinal dysfunction8,9; central nervous system (CNS) disturbances that may affect cognitive abilities, motor functions, and behavioral performance10; and degeneration of radiation-sensitive immunological tissues that could weaken the immune system11. One prominent long-term issue is the risk of fatal cancer from radiation exposure12,13. For context, over the course of one year, the typical human is exposed to approximately 3 milliSieverts (mSv) on Earth versus 144 mSv on the International Space Station (ISS)14,15, in addition to varied doses and types of ionizing radiation (IR). Astronauts on the ISS, which is located in LEO, are exposed to IR but are mostly protected by Earth’s magnetosphere. In contrast, future deep space missions outside of LEO will expose astronauts to increased doses of radiation, with a higher flux of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs)12. For example, a single 500-day mission to Mars would likely expose astronauts to 1000 mSv, the career limit set by international space agencies, which corresponds to a 3% increased risk of lethality from exposure-induced cancer16. Recent studies that incorporated non-targeted radiation effects estimate that cancer risks from Mars missions may be higher than previously estimated17. It is worth noting that other celestial bodies that have been nominated for far-future human exploration may be even more dangerous: One example is Europa, which receives more than 5000 mSv of radiation each day, enough to prove deadly to humans18. Current radiation countermeasures include nutrition, drugs, and anti-radiation spacecraft shielding, but these offer only partial protection19,20. Moreover, there are currently no FDA-approved radioprotectants that can be deployed for crews, although cytokine supplementation therapy (Neupogen, Neulasta, and Leukine) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of the acute hematopoietic syndrome. Other possible radiation countermeasures could include radiation absorbers and nutrition (scavenger vitamins, trace elements, and minerals) (Fig. 2)12,21. In addition, individual susceptibility to radiation-induced cancer may be a key factor22,23, with individual differences observed even in early studies of radiation victims24, and radiosensitivity appears to be influenced by a variety of factors. These factors include known susceptibility genes (such as BReast CAncer gene (BRCA) 1 and 2 mutations), age, sex, nutrition, toxin exposure, comorbidities, inflammatory state, and viral infections25. At this time, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) predicts individual risk for carcinogenesis based on statistics at the population level, and genomics and other omics data could better inform these estimates26. Such omics-based information for spaceflight could also be relevant for soldiers, emergency first responders, coal miners, radiologic technicians, reactor workers, pilots, and others who enter radioactive environments (Fig. 2)27. Example 2: Space-induced bone demineralization Observations within the limited setting of LEO suggest an average bone mineral density (BMD) loss of 1–1.5% each month for weight-bearing bones28,29. Six-month missions on the ISS reportedly induce bone loss equivalent to two decades of aging, some of which may be long-lasting30; this finding has implications about missions that will last more than one year on the ISS, the Moon, and Mars. Multiyear missions, especially ones that journey outside of LEO, are harder to model, due to the absence of any comparable data. However, recent models estimate astronauts may suffer 32.4–36.8% BMD loss during missions to Mars, with up to 100% developing osteopenia, 33% developing osteoporosis, and 79% reaching fracture risk levels that NASA deems impermissible31. These models were developed using astronaut data inside LEO31, which is a critical limitation; deep space radiation is hypothesized to exacerbate the BMD loss already caused by microgravity unloading32. For example, cancer patients routinely experience increased bone fracture risk in areas irradiated during treatment33. Hence, the severity of bone damage during interplanetary missions may be even higher, once taking into account the factor of deep space radiation and calcium loss. Bone healing could also be impaired due to microgravity, where sepsis and thromboembolic blood clots could ultimately present31. Moreover, even though BMD loss has been shown to partially recover one year after spaceflight, recovered bone appeared to be deposited into bone architecture similar to that of older people34, indicating the recovery is incomplete. With several upcoming human missions into deep space (e.g. Artemis II, III, dearMoon, and Mars missions), we will better understand the nature of space-induced bone demineralization. Those data could likely improve countermeasures and the incorporation of exercise, pharmacology, and nutrition protocols (Fig. 2). For example, the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) improves the health of astronauts by reducing the magnitude of common space health ailments, including BMD decreases35, isokinetic strength decreases36, and immune system dysregulation37. The ARED may confer more pronounced physiological benefits than its predecessor, the interim Resistive Exercise Device (iRED), which only offered resistance exercise at lower quality and quantity loads. Unfortunately, current exercise spaceflight devices may not practically be deployed in upcoming deep space vessels due to limited cargo volume. As such, flight exercise hardware may need to be scaled down for compatibility, and the feasibility of next-generation miniaturized equipment (such as the Miniature Exercise Device-2 (MED-2)) is currently being assessed38. Vitamin D is another key mediator of bone health through calcium absorption and bone mineralization, and represents a relevant target for upcoming missions. Prior to 2006, crews supplemented with ~400 International Units (IU) of vitamin D each day during 3–6 months missions still showed decreases in vitamin D status postflight39. When ground-based studies in Antarctica and Johnson Space Center verified that daily vitamin D doses of 800–2000 IU were safe and could maintain vitamin D status for 3–6 months in settings devoid of ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, vitamin D supplementation recommendations for space crew in similar missions were increased in 2006 from daily doses of 400 to 800 IU40. Despite such evidence-based improvements in dietary and exercise countermeasures, BMD loss remains an unsolved health hazard in spaceflight that will likely be more problematic for future long-term missions. Here again, omics data analysis could potentially further discover and improve countermeasures. While current equations that predict BMD loss consider population-level differences with factors of ethnicity, sex, and age31, research suggests that genetics may account for 60–80% of bone mass variability, and protective genes like LRP5 can help guide risk for astronauts. Naturally, any valuable omics-based countermeasures developed for bone health in space could spur innovations that benefit populations on Earth who suffer from bone loss, including the elderly, postmenopausal people, people with osteoporosis, and cancer patients who endure incidental bone loss after radiation treatment (Fig. 2). Studying omics for improved spaceflight safety Of note, there are some published alleles (Fig. 3) that occur naturally in human populations, and which have been linked to protective mechanisms with possible relevance to spaceflight healthcare, which could help guide the countermeasure examples described above. The protective effects of some of these alleles appear to mechanistically overlap with nutrition and exercise interventions, and have motivated new clinical trials (Fig. 3). Hence, basic scientific research into the protective mechanisms of these alleles could one day translate into improved therapeutic compound discovery and better-informed nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations for crew members to maintain their health during deep space exploration. After reviewing these published alleles and their promising implications, we then follow with examples of the numerous technical and ethical difficulties involved with basic scientific research into the protective mechanisms linked to these alleles. Fig. 3. Literature review of evidence for protective alleles. Open in a new tab Literature review and its key findings for a subset of alleles that may be linked to health protective effects, many of which occur naturally in the human population. From left to right: the gene name; example protective phenotypes; whether a polymorphism has been linked to the protective phenotype; whether the protective phenotype typically relates to over, under, or variant function of the gene; the level of evidence of protection for the variant on Earth (green icons) or in space (blue icons); and examples of known harmful associations with this allele. We further include if the gene or its related pathway can be targeted with exercise or nutrition (purple icon), has been studied in clinical trials (green icon), or has been observed to alter function during spaceflight. Only the highest level of evidence we found is displayed, with in vivo being defined as stronger evidence than in vitro, and health benefits for human subjects being defined as higher evidence than health benefits for rodent subjects.

More details and literature references are provided in the Supplementary Data. Human cohorts: Individuals Researchers discovered several of the alleles (Fig. 3) with protective mechanisms by studying special human cohorts, especially individuals with rare phenotypes. For example, a German toddler appeared “extraordinarily muscular” and was eventually diagnosed with a mutation in the myostatin-producing MSTN (GDF8) gene41. The loss-of-function mutation translated into an absence of mature myostatin for the patient, who experienced gross muscle hypertrophy, with quadricep muscles 7.2 standard deviations (SD) above average and subcutaneous fat thickness 2.88 SD below the expected mean41. MSTN targets are also being utilized in phase 2 clinical trials of humanized monoclonal MSTN antibodies, which confer increased muscle mass and strength in older individuals with recent falls42, and thus could represent applications for astronauts as well. Resistance training and creatine supplementation to decrease myostatin serum levels have also been deployed based on individual profiles43, which represent a non-omics intervention option for spaceflight. Human cohorts: Families Several other alleles have come to light through studying families with protective attributes. For example, genes linked to stronger bones (LRP5) and higher oxygen transport (EPOR) have been found in several family-based studies, and these protective pathways may be promising for spaceflight healthcare (Fig. 3). Specifically, the LRP5 G171V mutation was discovered when family members showed strikingly high BMD in clinical screenings while reporting difficulty staying afloat while swimming and no history of bone fractures44,45. The gain-of-function variant induces BMD about five times greater than the mean of the general population. The EPOR W439X mutation was found through linkage analysis of almost 100 family members46. The mutation elicits the beneficial symptoms of erythrocytosis (such as increased hemoglobin count, hematocrit count, and oxygen transport capacity) with only mild or minimal negative effects46. Interestingly, one proband, who had hemoglobin >200 g/L since childhood, was an Olympic gold medalist in cross-country skiing46. Annotating the network underpinnings of this allele could unravel new methods to combat clinical conditions that space travelers routinely suffer when exposed to altered gas composition in spacecraft. Human cohorts: Isolated populations Isolated populations have also revealed alleles linked to alleviated clinical manifestations of diseases like atherosclerosis and cancer (Fig. 3). For instance, in a patient from Limone sul Garda (an isolated village in Northern Italy), the APOA1 R173C mutation was associated with low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and elevated triglycerides, but unexpectedly no atherosclerotic disease47. When the complete Limone sul Garda population was sampled (n = 1000 total), 33 living carriers of the “ApoA-1 Milano” mutation were identified47, all with low HDL, and yet low incidence of heart disease. Genealogical analysis using church records suggested they were all possible descendants of one man born in the village in 178048. Patients with acute coronary syndromes intravenously administered R173C phospholipid complexes show significant regression of coronary atherosclerosis49. Studying the protective effects linked to APOA1 could reveal new methods to mitigate the risk of myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis, especially since astronauts endure above-average radiation exposure50,51. However, it is still unclear whether spaceflight, particularly long-duration missions outside LEO, may increase long-term atherosclerotic risk52. Statins may reduce radiation-induced atherosclerosis, but published results are thus not conclusive. The absence of suitable prophylaxes for atherosclerosis risk in both terrestrial humans exposed to radiation and astronauts exposed to space radiation motivates the thorough analysis of the APOA1 R173C mechanism to potentially uncover safe and effective therapeutic compounds. Additional examples of alleles linked to protective effects found in families include those related to Laron syndrome and genetic markers in Longevity Blue Zone (LBZ) populations. Laron syndrome is a rare condition that has been disproportionately reported in remote and inbred villages in the Loja province of Ecuador53. Patients typically have mutations in the GHR gene that are linked to growth hormone deficiency and decreased stature but are also linked to extended health span by potentially mitigating cancer and diabetes54. Given that cancer is a primary cause of death and a major health risk in upcoming long-term spaceflight, understanding the physiological underpinnings of GHR mutations associated with Laron syndrome could lead to potential anti-cancer therapies. LBZs are areas where the local population consists of unusually high numbers of elderly individuals. These LBZ populations have been identified in Sardinia and the Greek island of Ikaria. When compared to reference populations in Italy and Greece, LBZ populations show lower frequencies in genetic risk markers in APOE4, APOE2, and the TT allele of FOXO3, which are associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease and decreased cognitive function55. Human cohorts: Populations adapted to extreme environments Research on human adaptation to extreme environments has also revealed alleles with health implications applicable to spaceflight (Fig. 3), including deep-diving adaptations in indigenous Bajau people and high-altitude adaptation in indigenous people of the Tibetan Plateau. Both populations have adapted to lifestyles in which the gas composition of their surroundings is uniquely altered compared to most human populations, potentially informing new approaches to combat physiological maladies that many astronauts endure due to altered gas composition (e.g. hypercapnia) on the ISS. The Bajau people, sometimes referred to as “Sea Nomads”, have lived marine hunter-gatherer lifestyles in Southeast Asian seas for over 1000 years56. They are renowned for their remarkable breath-holding abilities, diving up to 73 meters using only wooden goggles and spending up to five hours each day apnea diving (breath-hold diving). One recent study found that Bajau people have significantly larger spleens than Saluan people, geographical neighbors with minimal marine-related lifestyles57. The likely cause is natural selection on allelic variants in the PDE10A gene, which are associated with larger spleen size, providing them with additional reserves of oxygenated red blood cells. The study also found evidence of strong selection for variants in the BDKRB2 gene, thought to increase peripheral vasoconstriction to preferentially redirect blood flow to critical tissues like the brain, heart, and lungs. Other candidate genes that appeared to be selected in the Bajau population included FAM178B, which encodes a protein that helps prevent the buildup of carbon dioxide, and CACNA1A, which regulates response to hypoxic conditions58. Insights into the genotypic physiology of hypoxia have not only emerged from populations who adapted to the seas, but also from those who adapted to the mountains. For millennia, people have lived on the Tibetan Plateau, which is surrounded by the two highest summits on Earth (Mount Everest and K2). The plateau averages ~4,000 meters above sea level and has 60% of the oxygen concentration and 130% of the UV radiation compared to sea level59. Several alleles were recently found under natural selection, likely due to the high-altitude lifestyle of this population60, including variants in the EGLN1 (HIF-PH2) gene, which prevents degradation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). This HIF response allows for increased expression of hypoxia-inducible genes and confers a low hematocrit phenotype, which is advantageous in high altitudes and showed expression changes in the NASA Twins Study6. The Tibetan population has an enrichment of mutations in the EPAS1 (HIF-2A) gene, which encodes subunits of HIFs that contribute to the development of blood vessels and render a low hemoglobin phenotype, while reducing any negative fitness consequences of excess red blood cell production60. Moreover, alleles in the MTHFR gene tend to create a low homocysteine and high folate phenotype in the Tibetan population, which can provide protection from hyperhomocysteinemia, endothelial cell injury, inflammation of blood vessels, and ischemic injury. The high folate phenotype also provides compensatory protection from UV radiation exposure, given that UV radiation degrades folate and folic acid in human blood. Elucidating how the Bajau and Tibetan populations adapted to hypoxia may have clinical implications for people with conditions such as anemia, cytopenia, and hypoxia from intensive care treatment, tumorigenesis, and life in space. Also, carbon dioxide levels are typically higher on the ISS than on Earth and are associated with decreased cognitive scores and increased headaches in astronauts6,61. Furthermore, gas composition in future Martian settlements could deviate at even greater ranges, given the atmospheric differences and unknown habitat designs. Humans have also experienced allelic adaptations to dietary habits, including lactase persistence from pastoralism in African populations62 and modulation of fatty acid metabolism from fatty acid-rich diets in Greenland populations63. Although these specific diets may not have direct implications for space nutrition, spaceflight food is restricted, and the diets of space travelers significantly differ from nominal terrestrial diets. Investigation of the interaction of dietary habits and omics may one day lead to healthier solutions for the limited spaceflight menu and possibly survey how future Martian societies biologically adapt over multiple generations to their unique nutritional lifestyles. Studying omics for improved spaceflight nutrition Nutritional counseling based on omics has also benefited individuals with both rare (phenylketonuria) and common (lactose intolerance) genetic variants that entail customized dietary approaches64. Other evidence of genetic variants modifying responses to numerous nutrients and food bioactives has also emerged, including vitamins (A, B12, C, and D), fats (polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids), caffeine, calcium, choline, folate, and iron65. Stratified outcomes were found for immunity, inflammation, the health of various organs (bone, heart, muscle, and liver), endurance, strength training recovery, and visuomotor skills, all of which can be pivotal for athletes, the young, or the elderly. Given the above evidence, omics metrics can also inform nutrition during space exploration. One unique example where this application has already proven meaningful relates to a distinctive ailment called spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), which has no known terrestrial analogues. The disease appears to present in a subset of astronauts after short- and long-duration spaceflight, more so in men than women, and includes choroidal folds, optic disk edema (swelling), and focal areas of the ischemic retina (cotton wool spots). Research has suggested that SANS may be associated with lower levels of various types of vitamin B, combined with common variations in one-carbon metabolism genes66. This intriguing finding illustrates the potential utility of omics to inform optimal nutrition during spaceflight. Dietary interventions specifically related to alleles listed in Fig. 3 could counteract space-induced inflammation. For example, several plant polyphenols can directly or indirectly activate SIRT1, which can reduce immune dysfunction, oxidative stress, autoimmunity, and inflammation67. In addition to immunological issues in space, the human body stores more iron during spaceflight (e.g. NASA Twins Study), which has been linked to increased oxidative stress and decreased regional BMD, further underscoring the potential of plant-based, antioxidant interventions for spaceflight nutrition. Also, improved insulin resistance from SIRT1 may share common biochemical pathways with numerous foods rich in polyphenols, including resveratrol (peanuts, grapes, and berries); piceatannol (Japanese knotweed); and fisetin (lotus root, persimmons, and apples)68. Space crews often experience increased insulin resistance69 and thus may benefit from consuming some nutritional derivatives, particularly those who are prone to possess low levels of SIRT1. Studying numerous other space-related allele variants displayed in Fig. 3 may similarly inform aerospace nutrition: The polyphenol curcumin increases LRP5 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and may instill similar bone-protective mechanisms of LRP5 variants70 as described above, the pigment β-Carotene is linked to the anti-aging benefits similar to TERT overproduction variants and may mitigate telomere attrition71, flavones have inhibitory effects on MAFBX (FBXO32, ATROGIN-1) expression and may prevent myotube diameter reduction during muscle atrophy72, and the plant alkaloid Berberine may inhibit PCSK9 and reduce unhealthy cholesterol levels73. Moreover, as astrobotany techniques progress, a wider selection of food crops could become successfully cultivable in space, and their nutritional and therapeutic properties could translate into valid countermeasures that avoid the negative side effects of pharmaceuticals and other space health approaches. Plant cells can deliver biomolecules that could benefit health in spaceflight: indeed, plants bioencapsulated with proinsulin have been shown to regulate blood sugar levels74. Metabolomics can help disentangle which space-farmed products may confer the most effective remedies for human illnesses during space exposure and which plants hold the greatest nutritional benefit per weight75. Plants in spaceflight can provide not only a wider assortment of nutrients, but also better air regeneration, water recycling, and mental health for astronauts, which could reduce flight risks. Also, discoveries in low-input and low-waste vegetation technology in space could be spun off to enhance sustainable agriculture back on Earth. Pharmacogenomics and optimized drug prescribing in space Spaceflight pharmacogenomics (SPGx) is the study of gene variants that influence the regulation of drug metabolism in space operations76,77. The drug-gene response can influence safety and efficacy, which can have a notable influence on health and performance. To date, there are roughly 570 drug-gene combinations used in terrestrial medicine for which pharmacogenomics-guided prescribing recommendations have been established by the FDA. One example of PGx relevant to spaceflight regards the phenomenon of statin-induced myopathy. Muscle loss in space remains a persistent challenge, so agents that facilitate myopathy in space are contraindicated. This can be contextualized by reviewing an investigation of a large military veteran cohort. Out of 7,769,356 veterans who took part in the study, nearly 55% took at least one drug with strong evidence of altered metabolism associated with a specific gene mutation over the six-year study period. Of particular concern, of the 533,928 participants who received new prescriptions of simvastatin, 25.6% were projected to have a SNP variant in SLC01B1 (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1). The SLCO1B1*5 variant represents a loss‐of‐function allele known to attenuate the hepatic uptake of atorvastatin78. This allele results in an increase in the amount of the parent drug in systemic circulation, which may put individuals at risk for myopathy, no matter the dose. The principle of PGx in space can be further illustrated by the case of codeine, which acts as a pain reliever via conversion to morphine by CYP450 2D6. Astronauts with the CYP450 2D6 slow metabolizer phenotype would be expected to convert only 10% of codeine to morphine. Therefore, codeine would be ineffective and should be removed from the mission drug list. Conversely, a 2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer will convert between 40 and 50% of codeine to morphine, which may result in morphine overdose and risk mission safety. In this case, codeine should be removed from the astronaut mission drug list because it is not safe79,80. Similar patterns have been seen for tramadol, where it may be ineffective for pain relief in slow metabolizers of CYP450 2D6. In 2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers, the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommends reducing tramadol dosage by 30% because of its tendency to produce symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, respiratory depression, confusion, and urinary retention81. Each of the above symptoms would be unideal or unacceptable on a space mission. Fortunately, many drug-associated adverse events are predictable and repeatable, because of known drug-gene dynamics. Spaceflight PGx can be used to tailor mission drug lists in such a way that drug efficacy can be optimized, drug side effects can be reduced, and astronaut safety and performance enhanced. Technical challenges of studying human space omics There are many challenges when studying genotype-phenotype interactions, both on Earth and in spaceflight. Engaging with national efforts (e.g. UK Biobank and the AllofUS program), as well as international groups like the International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP), can help develop standardization for space omics data and clinical applications82. These efforts can help optimize the extraction of actionable scientific findings from spaceflight omics data and increase the probability of safe and effective countermeasures in aerospace healthcare. Alongside this promising side, we also follow with examples of the numerous technical and ethical difficulties involved with basic scientific research into the protective mechanisms linked to these alleles. For instance, the protective mechanisms associated with these alleles may present differently between in vitro and in vivo studies, study designs, and location (in space versus on Earth). These challenges are further convoluted by pleiotropy, whereby secondary effects may accompany or even outweigh protective effects. In addition, the small sample sizes in the human space omics discipline may also increase the risk of over-associating spaceflight omics changes with clinical meanings. Given these complexities, careful collection of standardized data and metadata; multi-omics profiling of consenting crew members before, during, and after spaceflight; and methodical production of cell space atlases could all be employed to better inform how to design safe and effective therapeutic compounds, meal plans, exercise equipment, and lifestyle recommendations that enhance protective effects and diminish harmful effects in space83. Statistical power, accuracy, and orthologs Some difficulties with mapping protective alleles (e.g. in genome-wide association studies, GWAS) include the lack of replicability, non-coding annotations, and population stratification, which also are relevant for any polygenic risk score (PRS). The generalizability of a PRS can be poor if the population of interest does not align with the ancestry of the original GWAS study, a fact that can perpetuate health disparities84. Another difficulty relates to how evidence for genetic variations translates across populations, based on the impact of rare versus common variants and low effect sizes versus large effect sizes85. For example, the MTHFR gene is known to be highly polymorphic, and studies linking the A222V allele to diseases have found conflicting results based on ancestry86. Potential solutions may require increasing sample sizes of study populations and accounting for factors like geographical location, genome reference, ancestry, sex, and age87. In addition, as shown in Supplementary Data 2, research into potentially protective alleles can sometimes have inconsistent findings between studies, and this may be partially due to experimental differences that must be clearly documented in metadata. The timeline of exposure is one of many metadata factors that can drastically change measured outcomes. Standardization of these metadata will be crucial to derive meaningful information from space omics studies82. Pleiotropic complications Eliciting protective genotype-phenotype relationships is also challenging because several gene variants linked to protective phenotypes can concurrently also be linked to negative, potentially fatal, phenotypes. For example, while overproduction of TERT is linked to decreased aging, it is also linked to cancer risk88; while variants of PCSK9 are linked to decreased LDL and heart disease89, they are also linked to diabetes90 and low cognition91; while CCR5 variants are linked to decreased risks of cancer92, HIV93 and diseases of the heart94, liver95, and brain96, they also correspond to increased risks of various viruses like West Nile virus97; and while CTNNB1 overproduction is linked to radiation resistance98, it is also linked to increased cancer risk99. To complicate the matter, downstream effects of gene variants can interact with each other; this is the case with SOST and LRP5, both related to bone health100. Any nutrition and lifestyle recommendations, and any compounds developed, from basic studies of these alleles would need to meticulously ensure that concomitant negative effects are circumvented. Increasing the granularity of measures will allow for a better understanding of the cellular microenvironments and individual cellular subtypes, which could disentangle pleiotropic complications. Indeed, several papers referenced in Supplementary Data 2 emphasize the need for cell-type-specific studies to further resolve the physiology of the alleles101. Single cell sequencing technologies can generate high dimensional maps that resolve heterogeneous immunological cell types, allowing for better delineation of immune responses to various exposures and better interpretation of the immunosuppressive effects of spaceflight102. One specific example is an overexpression of SIRT1, which could deliver protective phenotypes. However, SIRT1 may increase the lifespan of rodent subjects when only overexpressed in particular regions, but not when overexpressed in the whole body103,104. Moreover, a global increase in the expression of SIRT1 throughout all cells in the body may even confer negative effects, particularly within subset populations of T-helper cells, where it has been demonstrated to compromise differentiation. Hence, understanding optimal expression changes at the cell-type and lineage-specific level will be necessary to account for pleiotropic effects105. Space-relevant harmful alleles We note that there are naturally occurring human alleles we did not highlight in this paper that are, in contrast, primarily known to be linked to space-related harmful effects. For example, mutations in the ATM gene may cause the disorder ataxia telangiectasia, and mutations in the NBS1 gene may cause Nijmegen breakage syndrome; in both cases, affected individuals can show chromosomal instability, radiation sensitivity, and cancer susceptibility106–108. Additional genes related to DNA repair, radiation sensitivity, and cancer predisposition include RAD50, BRCA1, BRCA2, P53, among many others109–111. Investigating these alleles may guide risk reduction during space exploration, as well as for any type of experience on Earth in which individuals are exposed to higher-than-average amounts of radiation. Another example is the I148M variant of the PNPLA3 gene, associated with an increased risk of chronic liver disease112. Interestingly, harmful effects of the PNPLA3 I148M mutation can be mitigated by one of the protective variants we listed in Fig. 3 (the rs72613567 variant of the HSD17B13 gene) in an allele and dose-dependent manner113. Counteracting risk for liver disease could be important, since space stressors may activate lipotoxic pathways that further elevate liver disease risk, potentially leading to lipid dysregulation and reduced immune activity in susceptible spaceflight participants114,115. In exploring genetic markers that confer potential risk in space, it is useful to further explore the APOE4/4 (APOE4) genotype in the context of novel exposures and cognitive changes. For example, there is a well-established phenomenon of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), which appears to be increased in APOE4 carriers116. In survivors of breast cancer who had undergone chemotherapy, APOE4 carriers had worse visual memory and spatial ability when examined five years after diagnosis. In breast cancer survivors, those APOE4 carriers undergoing chemotherapy had significantly lower scores on measures of working memory and processing speed when examined at 1-, 6-, and 18-months post-treatment117. In another study, APOE4 breast cancer survivors treated with cytostatics had lower scores on executive function, attention, and processing speed at one- and two-years post-treatment118. Moreover, radiation-induced cognitive decline shows similar deficits in cognition. Cramer et al. showed that, among patients undergoing therapeutic brain irradiation, roughly 30% experience cognitive decline by 4 months. In those living over 6 months, the rate increases to 50% or greater119. Makale et al. have reported that 50-90% of those undergoing partial or whole brain cranial radiation experience disabling cognitive impairment (thought APOE status was not assessed by Cramer or Makale)120. There is a paucity of human data related to APOE4 and spaceflight-associated cognitive risks. If the APOE4 genotype confers additional risk to cognitive decline in the presence of an exogenous stressor like space radiation, this would warrant careful attention to the APOE4 genotype in the future design of experiments concerning human spaceflight. It will also be important to determine whether the APOE2/2 genotype may be protective against cognitive decline in space in a manner similar to the protective effects of APOE2 on cognition on Earth. To illustrate one final example, the R506Q mutation of the F5 gene (Factor V Leiden) is one of the most common inherited susceptibilities to thrombophilia (blood clotting). The likelihood of blood clotting, which can be life-threatening, increases up to 7-fold in heterozygous carriers and up to 80-fold in homozygous individuals121. Immobility (such as during flight travel), increased estrogen levels (such as during pregnancy, hormone replacement therapy, and oral contraceptive use), and injuries (such as fractured bones) can further increase the risk for affected individuals122. Astronauts are frequently exposed to these associated risks, given the immobile nature of orbital flights, the personal decision by some participants to suppress menstruation with oral contraceptives during space missions, and the projected heightened risk of bone fractures in long-duration spaceflight123. Individuals could select specific countermeasures for blood clotting (such as compression stockings and anticoagulant substances) based on their personal risk profiles124. Ethical challenges of studying human space omics As discussed in this paper, the landscape of human spaceflight has entered a transformative period of democratization, with increased commercial flight opportunities and collaborative agreements between government and private entities125. This increased diversity in mission formats, flight objectives, and stakeholders is creating a ripple effect on ethics and regulation. Indeed, many policy discussions in the context of human research and healthcare in space that were once internal to government institutions now fall under the remit of the public forum, as discussed elsewhere126. Widened discussion of policy has been further expedited by a push for open science, reflected through international data sharing and collaboration initiatives, including the NASA Open Science Data Repository127 and the EXPAND (Enhancing eXploration Platforms and Analog Definition) program of the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH)128. Space agencies and commercial entities seek to identify biomarkers for spaceflight health effects to refine risk prediction, optimize mission planning, and elevate the standard of care for humans in space via improved countermeasures. In this paper, we have reviewed a number of published alleles naturally occurring in humans on Earth, and we have suggested their potential influence on the body’s response to the spaceflight environment. The use of allelic information for optimizing precision healthcare is commonplace on Earth, such as to avoid adverse reactions during drug prescriptions129, identify high-risk individuals to preemptively screen for disease onset, or refine diagnosis and inform therapeutic approach130. Similarly, allelic information and other omics could be used to optimize healthcare in space, such as through integration into precision healthcare strategies for government and commercial crew, the advent of which has been discussed elsewhere131. Of note, care should be taken that these alleles are not used for discriminatory practices, and updated legislation like the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) may be needed to account for the new risk paradigm of spaceflight and long-term care or life insurance. In terrestrial healthcare, emergent omics approaches also include genetic and epigenetic modification therapies132. If safely established on Earth, in the far future, one can imagine that similar modification therapies may eventually be investigated as candidate interventions for increased health and safety in crewed spaceflight, such as to protect against space stressors during long-duration missions to Mars, the outer solar system, and even beyond, as recently discussed18,105. While beyond the scope of this manuscript, we note that gene therapy is a particularly controversial subject matter, and its associated ethical challenges have been discussed elsewhere in the context of human spaceflight133,134.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In the foreseeable future, collecting, storing, and sharing omics data from consenting humans venturing into space for use in research and terrestrially established occupational healthcare strategies also requires careful policy to address a multitude of ethical challenges. Indeed, ethical challenges include developing data accessibility and sharing strategies without violation of privacy of individuals and family members, achieving meaningful informed consent throughout the entire data lifecycle, avoiding uses of data that support actions of a discriminatory or inequitable nature, ensuring thorough and expert ethical oversight of projects, and appropriately handling any incidental findings from the data134, as well as issues regarding the challenge of protecting astronauts135,136. Just as the landscape of human spaceflight is diversifying in a positive and more inclusive manner, so too are the opportunities for improving precision healthcare in flight and on longer missions137. For example, with genetic risk data in hand, individuals could exercise increased autonomy in making informed decisions about participating in spaceflight activities. In this paper, we reviewed an example set of published alleles purportedly linked to protective effects, the biochemical pathways of which could inform therapeutic compound discovery and nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations to protect health during spaceflight missions and potentially during postflight recovery and stationing on planetary surfaces, including the Moon and Mars138. This guide can also help individuals on Earth in high-stress and environmentally challenging scenarios, such as first responders, cave explorers, radiation workers, deep-sea investigators, or commercial astronauts like the Inspiration4, Axoim Space, and Polaris Dawn missions91,139–147. Alongside any untapped potential to enhance both terrestrial and aerospace precision healthcare, investigation of such alleles poses significant technical and ethical challenges. If humanity safely and effectively surmounts these hurdles, the revamped aerospace health recommendations that ensue could be incorporated with other types of countermeasures (such as artificial gravity, faster spacecraft, radiation shielding, and biotechnology for food and material production) in order to best preserve the well-being of life during future deep space missions and interplanetary exploration.",

Copyright notice ID: 11263583 PMID: 39039045 Abstract Common and rare alleles are now being annotated across millions of human genomes, and omics technologies are increasingly being used to develop health and treatment recommendations. However, these alleles have not yet been systematically characterized relative to aerospace medicine. Here, we review published alleles naturally found in human cohorts that have a likely protective effect, which is linked to decreased cancer risk and improved bone, muscular, and cardiovascular health. Although some technical and ethical challenges remain, research into these protective mechanisms could translate into improved nutrition, exercise, and health recommendations for crew members during deep space missions. Subject terms: Rare variants, Personalized medicine As space travel promises to become a reality for more humans, insights from human genetics could serve to inform space medicine. Here, the authors overview genetic variants that might confer a protective effect in space, and ethical and technical challenges to translating these findings.Introduction Humankind has entered a new chapter of deep space exploration, with numerous institutions worldwide publicly aspiring toward a sustainable human presence on the Moon and Mars, which is also broadening the diversity of humans in space. In the past two years, the first person with a prosthetic leg entered space (Inspiration4), and the first person with a physical disability was selected for professional astronaut training by the European Space Agency (ESA). The next few years of spaceflight also feature planned missions to the circumlunar environment after a half-century hiatus, including the first crewed commercial lunar flyby (a team of artists and civilians for the dearMoon project), further broadening the range of people going into space. Moreover, while a steady increase in female space explorers began in 1982, the first mission to land the first woman and person of color on the Moon will finally occur in the Artemis III mission (Fig. 1A), coincident with a broadening of the age ranges (Fig. 1B) and mission durations (Fig. 1C) of the astronauts.

C Boxplots representing the cumulative amount of time an astronaut spent in space plotted against the number of missions in which they have participated. Blue signifies male and pink signifies female astronauts in all plots. Data was scraped from supercluster.com on September 20th, 2021. Only astronauts who spent time in space and crossed the Kármán line are displayed.Of note, only 24 humans have voyaged into the more hazardous conditions outside low-Earth orbit (LEO), all during the Apollo program. The longest Apollo mission lasted only 12 days, and all adventurers were white men between ages 35 and 47, all of whom had passed rigorous physical fitness tests. Consequently, the objective of sending humankind to unexplored horizons over unmatched timescales evokes critical questions about how the human body will respond to new extremes, as well as how to best protect the health of the broader space-faring population. In the coming decades, public and professional space explorers will likely embark on multi-year missions to the Moon and Mars, and this can lead to a more equitable vision of crewed space exploration. Specifically, the space community can democratize vital aspects of spaceflight, ranging from tailored space suit designs, precision health recommendations, and customized countermeasures1,2. Risks for these crews include radiation-induced cancers, space-induced osteopenia, challenges with pregnancy and child development, and changes for human bodies in Martian- and Lunar-based communities. The same motivations that drive precision healthcare on Earth could be useful for these new populations in space, where molecular data could be employed to guide therapy and mission recommendations. Multipronged countermeasures that are both environmental (such as advanced spacesuits, spacecrafts, and space habitats) and biomedical (such as omics-based nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations) likely represent the best contenders to optimize health across a more inclusive gamut of humanity in space. In this paper, we highlight omics technologies as one potential component toward improving prospective health countermeasures in space2. Omics modeling tools assess multiple biological responses (including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, epitranscriptomics, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics) that can converge into useful solutions for mitigating spaceflight-induced physiological deconditioning. Indeed, omics-based recommendations can be integrated alongside other countermeasures to sustain human health in space, and near real-time health monitoring in space could also one day incorporate omics3. We review an example set of published alleles that appear to be linked to health-protective effects, with relevance both on Earth and in space. Basic research into the protective mechanisms of such alleles may translate into improved therapeutic compound discovery and better-informed nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations, not only for space explorers, but also for those who work in challenging conditions on Earth. We conclude by discussing some of the significant scientific and ethical challenges related to these themes.Results Growing evidence indicates that spaceflight can elicit a range of stressful and adaptive physiological responses on the human body. Environmental harms like radiation, microgravity, and altered gas composition can jeopardize the health of the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, digestive, nervous, integumentary, and immune systems; increase the risk of cancer, diabetes, and aging traits; and disrupt vision, sleep cycles, and cognitive behavior1. There are a range of known alleles across various health-risk categories (Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 1) that may warrant effective and precision countermeasures to improve the physical fitness of both spaceflight participants and terrestrial humans. Fig. 2. Spaceflight health risk countermeasures. Open in a new tab Examples of health-risk categories that warrant precision countermeasures to improve the physical fitness of both spaceflight participants and terrestrial humankind.

Examples of known genes relevant for spaceflight include those related to altered radiation tolerance (TP53), hematopoiesis (EPOR), bone density (LRP5), and immune function (HLA alleles and cytokines)4, although there may be upper limits for adaptation5. As such, even when the mechanism of a phenotype is known, natural evolution with extant alleles may have a limited range for adaptation. Nonetheless, an important role of omics (and other omics modeling, such as organoids)6,7 is to understand risks and mechanisms at a deeper level, so that traditional protective measures (such as spacesuits, exercise equipment, and radiation shielding) can be designed in more informed ways. As a result, comprehensive aerospace healthcare programs in the future would likely integrate both omics information and traditional protective measures. We briefly illustrate this below by focusing on key examples of radiation-induced cancer and space-induced bone demineralization. Example 1: Space-induced radiation syndrome and cancer threat Radiation exposure is one of the predominant health hazards of deep space missions, for both in-flight and long-term, post-flight risks. In-flight concerns include acute radiation sickness (ARS), which may include hair loss, cataracts, metabolic deficiency, and gastrointestinal dysfunction8,9; central nervous system (CNS) disturbances that may affect cognitive abilities, motor functions, and behavioral performance10; and degeneration of radiation-sensitive immunological tissues that could weaken the immune system11. One prominent long-term issue is the risk of fatal cancer from radiation exposure12,13. For context, over the course of one year, the typical human is exposed to approximately 3 milliSieverts (mSv) on Earth versus 144 mSv on the International Space Station (ISS)14,15, in addition to varied doses and types of ionizing radiation (IR). Astronauts on the ISS, which is located in LEO, are exposed to IR but are mostly protected by Earth’s magnetosphere. In contrast, future deep space missions outside of LEO will expose astronauts to increased doses of radiation, with a higher flux of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs)12. For example, a single 500-day mission to Mars would likely expose astronauts to 1000 mSv, the career limit set by international space agencies, which corresponds to a 3% increased risk of lethality from exposure-induced cancer16. Recent studies that incorporated non-targeted radiation effects estimate that cancer risks from Mars missions may be higher than previously estimated17. It is worth noting that other celestial bodies that have been nominated for far-future human exploration may be even more dangerous: One example is Europa, which receives more than 5000 mSv of radiation each day, enough to prove deadly to humans18. Current radiation countermeasures include nutrition, drugs, and anti-radiation spacecraft shielding, but these offer only partial protection19,20. Moreover, there are currently no FDA-approved radioprotectants that can be deployed for crews, although cytokine supplementation therapy (Neupogen, Neulasta, and Leukine) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of the acute hematopoietic syndrome. Other possible radiation countermeasures could include radiation absorbers and nutrition (scavenger vitamins, trace elements, and minerals) (Fig. 2)12,21. In addition, individual susceptibility to radiation-induced cancer may be a key factor22,23, with individual differences observed even in early studies of radiation victims24, and radiosensitivity appears to be influenced by a variety of factors. These factors include known susceptibility genes (such as BReast CAncer gene (BRCA) 1 and 2 mutations), age, sex, nutrition, toxin exposure, comorbidities, inflammatory state, and viral infections25. At this time, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) predicts individual risk for carcinogenesis based on statistics at the population level, and genomics and other omics data could better inform these estimates26. Such omics-based information for spaceflight could also be relevant for soldiers, emergency first responders, coal miners, radiologic technicians, reactor workers, pilots, and others who enter radioactive environments (Fig. 2)27.Example 2: Space-induced bone demineralization Observations within the limited setting of LEO suggest an average bone mineral density (BMD) loss of 1–1.5% each month for weight-bearing bones28,29. Six-month missions on the ISS reportedly induce bone loss equivalent to two decades of aging, some of which may be long-lasting30; this finding has implications about missions that will last more than one year on the ISS, the Moon, and Mars. Multiyear missions, especially ones that journey outside of LEO, are harder to model, due to the absence of any comparable data. However, recent models estimate astronauts may suffer 32.4–36.8% BMD loss during missions to Mars, with up to 100% developing osteopenia, 33% developing osteoporosis, and 79% reaching fracture risk levels that NASA deems impermissible31. These models were developed using astronaut data inside LEO31, which is a critical limitation; deep space radiation is hypothesized to exacerbate the BMD loss already caused by microgravity unloading32. For example, cancer patients routinely experience increased bone fracture risk in areas irradiated during treatment33. Hence, the severity of bone damage during interplanetary missions may be even higher, once taking into account the factor of deep space radiation and calcium loss. Bone healing could also be impaired due to microgravity, where sepsis and thromboembolic blood clots could ultimately present31. Moreover, even though BMD loss has been shown to partially recover one year after spaceflight, recovered bone appeared to be deposited into bone architecture similar to that of older people34, indicating the recovery is incomplete. With several upcoming human missions into deep space (e.g. Artemis II, III, dearMoon, and Mars missions), we will better understand the nature of space-induced bone demineralization. Those data could likely improve countermeasures and the incorporation of exercise, pharmacology, and nutrition protocols (Fig. 2). For example, the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) improves the health of astronauts by reducing the magnitude of common space health ailments, including BMD decreases35, isokinetic strength decreases36, and immune system dysregulation37. The ARED may confer more pronounced physiological benefits than its predecessor, the interim Resistive Exercise Device (iRED), which only offered resistance exercise at lower quality and quantity loads. Unfortunately, current exercise spaceflight devices may not practically be deployed in upcoming deep space vessels due to limited cargo volume. As such, flight exercise hardware may need to be scaled down for compatibility, and the feasibility of next-generation miniaturized equipment (such as the Miniature Exercise Device-2 (MED-2)) is currently being assessed38. Vitamin D is another key mediator of bone health through calcium absorption and bone mineralization, and represents a relevant target for upcoming missions. Prior to 2006, crews supplemented with ~400 International Units (IU) of vitamin D each day during 3–6 months missions still showed decreases in vitamin D status postflight39. When ground-based studies in Antarctica and Johnson Space Center verified that daily vitamin D doses of 800–2000 IU were safe and could maintain vitamin D status for 3–6 months in settings devoid of ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, vitamin D supplementation recommendations for space crew in similar missions were increased in 2006 from daily doses of 400 to 800 IU40. Despite such evidence-based improvements in dietary and exercise countermeasures, BMD loss remains an unsolved health hazard in spaceflight that will likely be more problematic for future long-term missions. Here again, omics data analysis could potentially further discover and improve countermeasures. While current equations that predict BMD loss consider population-level differences with factors of ethnicity, sex, and age31, research suggests that genetics may account for 60–80% of bone mass variability, and protective genes like LRP5 can help guide risk for astronauts. Naturally, any valuable omics-based countermeasures developed for bone health in space could spur innovations that benefit populations on Earth who suffer from bone loss, including the elderly, postmenopausal people, people with osteoporosis, and cancer patients who endure incidental bone loss after radiation treatment (Fig. 2).Studying omics for improved spaceflight safety Of note, there are some published alleles (Fig. 3) that occur naturally in human populations, and which have been linked to protective mechanisms with possible relevance to spaceflight healthcare, which could help guide the countermeasure examples described above. The protective effects of some of these alleles appear to mechanistically overlap with nutrition and exercise interventions, and have motivated new clinical trials (Fig. 3). Hence, basic scientific research into the protective mechanisms of these alleles could one day translate into improved therapeutic compound discovery and better-informed nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations for crew members to maintain their health during deep space exploration. After reviewing these published alleles and their promising implications, we then follow with examples of the numerous technical and ethical difficulties involved with basic scientific research into the protective mechanisms linked to these alleles.

Open in a new tab Literature review and its key findings for a subset of alleles that may be linked to health protective effects, many of which occur naturally in the human population. From left to right: the gene name; example protective phenotypes; whether a polymorphism has been linked to the protective phenotype; whether the protective phenotype typically relates to over, under, or variant function of the gene; the level of evidence of protection for the variant on Earth (green icons) or in space (blue icons); and examples of known harmful associations with this allele. We further include if the gene or its related pathway can be targeted with exercise or nutrition (purple icon), has been studied in clinical trials (green icon), or has been observed to alter function during spaceflight. Only the highest level of evidence we found is displayed, with in vivo being defined as stronger evidence than in vitro, and health benefits for human subjects being defined as higher evidence than health benefits for rodent subjects.

More details and literature references are provided in the Supplementary Data.Human cohorts: Individuals Researchers discovered several of the alleles (Fig. 3) with protective mechanisms by studying special human cohorts, especially individuals with rare phenotypes. For example, a German toddler appeared “extraordinarily muscular” and was eventually diagnosed with a mutation in the myostatin-producing MSTN (GDF8) gene41. The loss-of-function mutation translated into an absence of mature myostatin for the patient, who experienced gross muscle hypertrophy, with quadricep muscles 7.2 standard deviations (SD) above average and subcutaneous fat thickness 2.88 SD below the expected mean41. MSTN targets are also being utilized in phase 2 clinical trials of humanized monoclonal MSTN antibodies, which confer increased muscle mass and strength in older individuals with recent falls42, and thus could represent applications for astronauts as well. Resistance training and creatine supplementation to decrease myostatin serum levels have also been deployed based on individual profiles43, which represent a non-omics intervention option for spaceflight.Human cohorts: Families Several other alleles have come to light through studying families with protective attributes. For example, genes linked to stronger bones (LRP5) and higher oxygen transport (EPOR) have been found in several family-based studies, and these protective pathways may be promising for spaceflight healthcare (Fig. 3). Specifically, the LRP5 G171V mutation was discovered when family members showed strikingly high BMD in clinical screenings while reporting difficulty staying afloat while swimming and no history of bone fractures44,45. The gain-of-function variant induces BMD about five times greater than the mean of the general population. The EPOR W439X mutation was found through linkage analysis of almost 100 family members46. The mutation elicits the beneficial symptoms of erythrocytosis (such as increased hemoglobin count, hematocrit count, and oxygen transport capacity) with only mild or minimal negative effects46. Interestingly, one proband, who had hemoglobin >200 g/L since childhood, was an Olympic gold medalist in cross-country skiing46. Annotating the network underpinnings of this allele could unravel new methods to combat clinical conditions that space travelers routinely suffer when exposed to altered gas composition in spacecraft.Human cohorts: Isolated populations Isolated populations have also revealed alleles linked to alleviated clinical manifestations of diseases like atherosclerosis and cancer (Fig. 3). For instance, in a patient from Limone sul Garda (an isolated village in Northern Italy), the APOA1 R173C mutation was associated with low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and elevated triglycerides, but unexpectedly no atherosclerotic disease47. When the complete Limone sul Garda population was sampled (n = 1000 total), 33 living carriers of the “ApoA-1 Milano” mutation were identified47, all with low HDL, and yet low incidence of heart disease. Genealogical analysis using church records suggested they were all possible descendants of one man born in the village in 178048. Patients with acute coronary syndromes intravenously administered R173C phospholipid complexes show significant regression of coronary atherosclerosis49. Studying the protective effects linked to APOA1 could reveal new methods to mitigate the risk of myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis, especially since astronauts endure above-average radiation exposure50,51. However, it is still unclear whether spaceflight, particularly long-duration missions outside LEO, may increase long-term atherosclerotic risk52. Statins may reduce radiation-induced atherosclerosis, but published results are thus not conclusive. The absence of suitable prophylaxes for atherosclerosis risk in both terrestrial humans exposed to radiation and astronauts exposed to space radiation motivates the thorough analysis of the APOA1 R173C mechanism to potentially uncover safe and effective therapeutic compounds. Additional examples of alleles linked to protective effects found in families include those related to Laron syndrome and genetic markers in Longevity Blue Zone (LBZ) populations. Laron syndrome is a rare condition that has been disproportionately reported in remote and inbred villages in the Loja province of Ecuador53. Patients typically have mutations in the GHR gene that are linked to growth hormone deficiency and decreased stature but are also linked to extended health span by potentially mitigating cancer and diabetes54. Given that cancer is a primary cause of death and a major health risk in upcoming long-term spaceflight, understanding the physiological underpinnings of GHR mutations associated with Laron syndrome could lead to potential anti-cancer therapies. LBZs are areas where the local population consists of unusually high numbers of elderly individuals. These LBZ populations have been identified in Sardinia and the Greek island of Ikaria. When compared to reference populations in Italy and Greece, LBZ populations show lower frequencies in genetic risk markers in APOE4, APOE2, and the TT allele of FOXO3, which are associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease and decreased cognitive function55.Human cohorts: Populations adapted to extreme environments Research on human adaptation to extreme environments has also revealed alleles with health implications applicable to spaceflight (Fig. 3), including deep-diving adaptations in indigenous Bajau people and high-altitude adaptation in indigenous people of the Tibetan Plateau. Both populations have adapted to lifestyles in which the gas composition of their surroundings is uniquely altered compared to most human populations, potentially informing new approaches to combat physiological maladies that many astronauts endure due to altered gas composition (e.g. hypercapnia) on the ISS. The Bajau people, sometimes referred to as “Sea Nomads”, have lived marine hunter-gatherer lifestyles in Southeast Asian seas for over 1000 years56. They are renowned for their remarkable breath-holding abilities, diving up to 73 meters using only wooden goggles and spending up to five hours each day apnea diving (breath-hold diving). One recent study found that Bajau people have significantly larger spleens than Saluan people, geographical neighbors with minimal marine-related lifestyles57. The likely cause is natural selection on allelic variants in the PDE10A gene, which are associated with larger spleen size, providing them with additional reserves of oxygenated red blood cells. The study also found evidence of strong selection for variants in the BDKRB2 gene, thought to increase peripheral vasoconstriction to preferentially redirect blood flow to critical tissues like the brain, heart, and lungs. Other candidate genes that appeared to be selected in the Bajau population included FAM178B, which encodes a protein that helps prevent the buildup of carbon dioxide, and CACNA1A, which regulates response to hypoxic conditions58. Insights into the genotypic physiology of hypoxia have not only emerged from populations who adapted to the seas, but also from those who adapted to the mountains. For millennia, people have lived on the Tibetan Plateau, which is surrounded by the two highest summits on Earth (Mount Everest and K2). The plateau averages ~4,000 meters above sea level and has 60% of the oxygen concentration and 130% of the UV radiation compared to sea level59. Several alleles were recently found under natural selection, likely due to the high-altitude lifestyle of this population60, including variants in the EGLN1 (HIF-PH2) gene, which prevents degradation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). This HIF response allows for increased expression of hypoxia-inducible genes and confers a low hematocrit phenotype, which is advantageous in high altitudes and showed expression changes in the NASA Twins Study6. The Tibetan population has an enrichment of mutations in the EPAS1 (HIF-2A) gene, which encodes subunits of HIFs that contribute to the development of blood vessels and render a low hemoglobin phenotype, while reducing any negative fitness consequences of excess red blood cell production60. Moreover, alleles in the MTHFR gene tend to create a low homocysteine and high folate phenotype in the Tibetan population, which can provide protection from hyperhomocysteinemia, endothelial cell injury, inflammation of blood vessels, and ischemic injury. The high folate phenotype also provides compensatory protection from UV radiation exposure, given that UV radiation degrades folate and folic acid in human blood. Elucidating how the Bajau and Tibetan populations adapted to hypoxia may have clinical implications for people with conditions such as anemia, cytopenia, and hypoxia from intensive care treatment, tumorigenesis, and life in space. Also, carbon dioxide levels are typically higher on the ISS than on Earth and are associated with decreased cognitive scores and increased headaches in astronauts6,61. Furthermore, gas composition in future Martian settlements could deviate at even greater ranges, given the atmospheric differences and unknown habitat designs. Humans have also experienced allelic adaptations to dietary habits, including lactase persistence from pastoralism in African populations62 and modulation of fatty acid metabolism from fatty acid-rich diets in Greenland populations63. Although these specific diets may not have direct implications for space nutrition, spaceflight food is restricted, and the diets of space travelers significantly differ from nominal terrestrial diets. Investigation of the interaction of dietary habits and omics may one day lead to healthier solutions for the limited spaceflight menu and possibly survey how future Martian societies biologically adapt over multiple generations to their unique nutritional lifestyles.Studying omics for improved spaceflight nutrition Nutritional counseling based on omics has also benefited individuals with both rare (phenylketonuria) and common (lactose intolerance) genetic variants that entail customized dietary approaches64. Other evidence of genetic variants modifying responses to numerous nutrients and food bioactives has also emerged, including vitamins (A, B12, C, and D), fats (polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids), caffeine, calcium, choline, folate, and iron65. Stratified outcomes were found for immunity, inflammation, the health of various organs (bone, heart, muscle, and liver), endurance, strength training recovery, and visuomotor skills, all of which can be pivotal for athletes, the young, or the elderly. Given the above evidence, omics metrics can also inform nutrition during space exploration. One unique example where this application has already proven meaningful relates to a distinctive ailment called spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), which has no known terrestrial analogues. The disease appears to present in a subset of astronauts after short- and long-duration spaceflight, more so in men than women, and includes choroidal folds, optic disk edema (swelling), and focal areas of the ischemic retina (cotton wool spots). Research has suggested that SANS may be associated with lower levels of various types of vitamin B, combined with common variations in one-carbon metabolism genes66. This intriguing finding illustrates the potential utility of omics to inform optimal nutrition during spaceflight. Dietary interventions specifically related to alleles listed in Fig. 3 could counteract space-induced inflammation. For example, several plant polyphenols can directly or indirectly activate SIRT1, which can reduce immune dysfunction, oxidative stress, autoimmunity, and inflammation67. In addition to immunological issues in space, the human body stores more iron during spaceflight (e.g. NASA Twins Study), which has been linked to increased oxidative stress and decreased regional BMD, further underscoring the potential of plant-based, antioxidant interventions for spaceflight nutrition. Also, improved insulin resistance from SIRT1 may share common biochemical pathways with numerous foods rich in polyphenols, including resveratrol (peanuts, grapes, and berries); piceatannol (Japanese knotweed); and fisetin (lotus root, persimmons, and apples)68. Space crews often experience increased insulin resistance69 and thus may benefit from consuming some nutritional derivatives, particularly those who are prone to possess low levels of SIRT1. Studying numerous other space-related allele variants displayed in Fig. 3 may similarly inform aerospace nutrition: The polyphenol curcumin increases LRP5 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and may instill similar bone-protective mechanisms of LRP5 variants70 as described above, the pigment β-Carotene is linked to the anti-aging benefits similar to TERT overproduction variants and may mitigate telomere attrition71, flavones have inhibitory effects on MAFBX (FBXO32, ATROGIN-1) expression and may prevent myotube diameter reduction during muscle atrophy72, and the plant alkaloid Berberine may inhibit PCSK9 and reduce unhealthy cholesterol levels73. Moreover, as astrobotany techniques progress, a wider selection of food crops could become successfully cultivable in space, and their nutritional and therapeutic properties could translate into valid countermeasures that avoid the negative side effects of pharmaceuticals and other space health approaches. Plant cells can deliver biomolecules that could benefit health in spaceflight: indeed, plants bioencapsulated with proinsulin have been shown to regulate blood sugar levels74. Metabolomics can help disentangle which space-farmed products may confer the most effective remedies for human illnesses during space exposure and which plants hold the greatest nutritional benefit per weight75. Plants in spaceflight can provide not only a wider assortment of nutrients, but also better air regeneration, water recycling, and mental health for astronauts, which could reduce flight risks. Also, discoveries in low-input and low-waste vegetation technology in space could be spun off to enhance sustainable agriculture back on Earth.Pharmacogenomics and optimized drug prescribing in space Spaceflight pharmacogenomics (SPGx) is the study of gene variants that influence the regulation of drug metabolism in space operations76,77. The drug-gene response can influence safety and efficacy, which can have a notable influence on health and performance. To date, there are roughly 570 drug-gene combinations used in terrestrial medicine for which pharmacogenomics-guided prescribing recommendations have been established by the FDA. One example of PGx relevant to spaceflight regards the phenomenon of statin-induced myopathy. Muscle loss in space remains a persistent challenge, so agents that facilitate myopathy in space are contraindicated. This can be contextualized by reviewing an investigation of a large military veteran cohort. Out of 7,769,356 veterans who took part in the study, nearly 55% took at least one drug with strong evidence of altered metabolism associated with a specific gene mutation over the six-year study period. Of particular concern, of the 533,928 participants who received new prescriptions of simvastatin, 25.6% were projected to have a SNP variant in SLC01B1 (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1). The SLCO1B1*5 variant represents a loss‐of‐function allele known to attenuate the hepatic uptake of atorvastatin78. This allele results in an increase in the amount of the parent drug in systemic circulation, which may put individuals at risk for myopathy, no matter the dose. The principle of PGx in space can be further illustrated by the case of codeine, which acts as a pain reliever via conversion to morphine by CYP450 2D6. Astronauts with the CYP450 2D6 slow metabolizer phenotype would be expected to convert only 10% of codeine to morphine. Therefore, codeine would be ineffective and should be removed from the mission drug list. Conversely, a 2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer will convert between 40 and 50% of codeine to morphine, which may result in morphine overdose and risk mission safety. In this case, codeine should be removed from the astronaut mission drug list because it is not safe79,80. Similar patterns have been seen for tramadol, where it may be ineffective for pain relief in slow metabolizers of CYP450 2D6. In 2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers, the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommends reducing tramadol dosage by 30% because of its tendency to produce symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, respiratory depression, confusion, and urinary retention81. Each of the above symptoms would be unideal or unacceptable on a space mission. Fortunately, many drug-associated adverse events are predictable and repeatable, because of known drug-gene dynamics. Spaceflight PGx can be used to tailor mission drug lists in such a way that drug efficacy can be optimized, drug side effects can be reduced, and astronaut safety and performance enhanced.Technical challenges of studying human space omics There are many challenges when studying genotype-phenotype interactions, both on Earth and in spaceflight. Engaging with national efforts (e.g. UK Biobank and the AllofUS program), as well as international groups like the International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP), can help develop standardization for space omics data and clinical applications82. These efforts can help optimize the extraction of actionable scientific findings from spaceflight omics data and increase the probability of safe and effective countermeasures in aerospace healthcare. Alongside this promising side, we also follow with examples of the numerous technical and ethical difficulties involved with basic scientific research into the protective mechanisms linked to these alleles. For instance, the protective mechanisms associated with these alleles may present differently between in vitro and in vivo studies, study designs, and location (in space versus on Earth). These challenges are further convoluted by pleiotropy, whereby secondary effects may accompany or even outweigh protective effects. In addition, the small sample sizes in the human space omics discipline may also increase the risk of over-associating spaceflight omics changes with clinical meanings. Given these complexities, careful collection of standardized data and metadata; multi-omics profiling of consenting crew members before, during, and after spaceflight; and methodical production of cell space atlases could all be employed to better inform how to design safe and effective therapeutic compounds, meal plans, exercise equipment, and lifestyle recommendations that enhance protective effects and diminish harmful effects in space83.Statistical power, accuracy, and orthologs Some difficulties with mapping protective alleles (e.g. in genome-wide association studies, GWAS) include the lack of replicability, non-coding annotations, and population stratification, which also are relevant for any polygenic risk score (PRS). The generalizability of a PRS can be poor if the population of interest does not align with the ancestry of the original GWAS study, a fact that can perpetuate health disparities84. Another difficulty relates to how evidence for genetic variations translates across populations, based on the impact of rare versus common variants and low effect sizes versus large effect sizes85. For example, the MTHFR gene is known to be highly polymorphic, and studies linking the A222V allele to diseases have found conflicting results based on ancestry86. Potential solutions may require increasing sample sizes of study populations and accounting for factors like geographical location, genome reference, ancestry, sex, and age87. In addition, as shown in Supplementary Data 2, research into potentially protective alleles can sometimes have inconsistent findings between studies, and this may be partially due to experimental differences that must be clearly documented in metadata. The timeline of exposure is one of many metadata factors that can drastically change measured outcomes. Standardization of these metadata will be crucial to derive meaningful information from space omics studies82.Pleiotropic complications Eliciting protective genotype-phenotype relationships is also challenging because several gene variants linked to protective phenotypes can concurrently also be linked to negative, potentially fatal, phenotypes. For example, while overproduction of TERT is linked to decreased aging, it is also linked to cancer risk88; while variants of PCSK9 are linked to decreased LDL and heart disease89, they are also linked to diabetes90 and low cognition91; while CCR5 variants are linked to decreased risks of cancer92, HIV93 and diseases of the heart94, liver95, and brain96, they also correspond to increased risks of various viruses like West Nile virus97; and while CTNNB1 overproduction is linked to radiation resistance98, it is also linked to increased cancer risk99. To complicate the matter, downstream effects of gene variants can interact with each other; this is the case with SOST and LRP5, both related to bone health100. Any nutrition and lifestyle recommendations, and any compounds developed, from basic studies of these alleles would need to meticulously ensure that concomitant negative effects are circumvented. Increasing the granularity of measures will allow for a better understanding of the cellular microenvironments and individual cellular subtypes, which could disentangle pleiotropic complications. Indeed, several papers referenced in Supplementary Data 2 emphasize the need for cell-type-specific studies to further resolve the physiology of the alleles101. Single cell sequencing technologies can generate high dimensional maps that resolve heterogeneous immunological cell types, allowing for better delineation of immune responses to various exposures and better interpretation of the immunosuppressive effects of spaceflight102. One specific example is an overexpression of SIRT1, which could deliver protective phenotypes. However, SIRT1 may increase the lifespan of rodent subjects when only overexpressed in particular regions, but not when overexpressed in the whole body103,104. Moreover, a global increase in the expression of SIRT1 throughout all cells in the body may even confer negative effects, particularly within subset populations of T-helper cells, where it has been demonstrated to compromise differentiation. Hence, understanding optimal expression changes at the cell-type and lineage-specific level will be necessary to account for pleiotropic effects105.Space-relevant harmful alleles We note that there are naturally occurring human alleles we did not highlight in this paper that are, in contrast, primarily known to be linked to space-related harmful effects. For example, mutations in the ATM gene may cause the disorder ataxia telangiectasia, and mutations in the NBS1 gene may cause Nijmegen breakage syndrome; in both cases, affected individuals can show chromosomal instability, radiation sensitivity, and cancer susceptibility106–108. Additional genes related to DNA repair, radiation sensitivity, and cancer predisposition include RAD50, BRCA1, BRCA2, P53, among many others109–111. Investigating these alleles may guide risk reduction during space exploration, as well as for any type of experience on Earth in which individuals are exposed to higher-than-average amounts of radiation. Another example is the I148M variant of the PNPLA3 gene, associated with an increased risk of chronic liver disease112. Interestingly, harmful effects of the PNPLA3 I148M mutation can be mitigated by one of the protective variants we listed in Fig. 3 (the rs72613567 variant of the HSD17B13 gene) in an allele and dose-dependent manner113. Counteracting risk for liver disease could be important, since space stressors may activate lipotoxic pathways that further elevate liver disease risk, potentially leading to lipid dysregulation and reduced immune activity in susceptible spaceflight participants114,115. In exploring genetic markers that confer potential risk in space, it is useful to further explore the APOE4/4 (APOE4) genotype in the context of novel exposures and cognitive changes. For example, there is a well-established phenomenon of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), which appears to be increased in APOE4 carriers116. In survivors of breast cancer who had undergone chemotherapy, APOE4 carriers had worse visual memory and spatial ability when examined five years after diagnosis. In breast cancer survivors, those APOE4 carriers undergoing chemotherapy had significantly lower scores on measures of working memory and processing speed when examined at 1-, 6-, and 18-months post-treatment117. In another study, APOE4 breast cancer survivors treated with cytostatics had lower scores on executive function, attention, and processing speed at one- and two-years post-treatment118. Moreover, radiation-induced cognitive decline shows similar deficits in cognition. Cramer et al. showed that, among patients undergoing therapeutic brain irradiation, roughly 30% experience cognitive decline by 4 months. In those living over 6 months, the rate increases to 50% or greater119. Makale et al. have reported that 50-90% of those undergoing partial or whole brain cranial radiation experience disabling cognitive impairment (thought APOE status was not assessed by Cramer or Makale)120. There is a paucity of human data related to APOE4 and spaceflight-associated cognitive risks. If the APOE4 genotype confers additional risk to cognitive decline in the presence of an exogenous stressor like space radiation, this would warrant careful attention to the APOE4 genotype in the future design of experiments concerning human spaceflight. It will also be important to determine whether the APOE2/2 genotype may be protective against cognitive decline in space in a manner similar to the protective effects of APOE2 on cognition on Earth. To illustrate one final example, the R506Q mutation of the F5 gene (Factor V Leiden) is one of the most common inherited susceptibilities to thrombophilia (blood clotting). The likelihood of blood clotting, which can be life-threatening, increases up to 7-fold in heterozygous carriers and up to 80-fold in homozygous individuals121. Immobility (such as during flight travel), increased estrogen levels (such as during pregnancy, hormone replacement therapy, and oral contraceptive use), and injuries (such as fractured bones) can further increase the risk for affected individuals122. Astronauts are frequently exposed to these associated risks, given the immobile nature of orbital flights, the personal decision by some participants to suppress menstruation with oral contraceptives during space missions, and the projected heightened risk of bone fractures in long-duration spaceflight123. Individuals could select specific countermeasures for blood clotting (such as compression stockings and anticoagulant substances) based on their personal risk profiles124.Ethical challenges of studying human space omics As discussed in this paper, the landscape of human spaceflight has entered a transformative period of democratization, with increased commercial flight opportunities and collaborative agreements between government and private entities125. This increased diversity in mission formats, flight objectives, and stakeholders is creating a ripple effect on ethics and regulation. Indeed, many policy discussions in the context of human research and healthcare in space that were once internal to government institutions now fall under the remit of the public forum, as discussed elsewhere126. Widened discussion of policy has been further expedited by a push for open science, reflected through international data sharing and collaboration initiatives, including the NASA Open Science Data Repository127 and the EXPAND (Enhancing eXploration Platforms and Analog Definition) program of the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH)128. Space agencies and commercial entities seek to identify biomarkers for spaceflight health effects to refine risk prediction, optimize mission planning, and elevate the standard of care for humans in space via improved countermeasures. In this paper, we have reviewed a number of published alleles naturally occurring in humans on Earth, and we have suggested their potential influence on the body’s response to the spaceflight environment. The use of allelic information for optimizing precision healthcare is commonplace on Earth, such as to avoid adverse reactions during drug prescriptions129, identify high-risk individuals to preemptively screen for disease onset, or refine diagnosis and inform therapeutic approach130. Similarly, allelic information and other omics could be used to optimize healthcare in space, such as through integration into precision healthcare strategies for government and commercial crew, the advent of which has been discussed elsewhere131. Of note, care should be taken that these alleles are not used for discriminatory practices, and updated legislation like the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) may be needed to account for the new risk paradigm of spaceflight and long-term care or life insurance. In terrestrial healthcare, emergent omics approaches also include genetic and epigenetic modification therapies132. If safely established on Earth, in the far future, one can imagine that similar modification therapies may eventually be investigated as candidate interventions for increased health and safety in crewed spaceflight, such as to protect against space stressors during long-duration missions to Mars, the outer solar system, and even beyond, as recently discussed18,105. While beyond the scope of this manuscript, we note that gene therapy is a particularly controversial subject matter, and its associated ethical challenges have been discussed elsewhere in the context of human spaceflight133,134.Discussion In the foreseeable future, collecting, storing, and sharing omics data from consenting humans venturing into space for use in research and terrestrially established occupational healthcare strategies also requires careful policy to address a multitude of ethical challenges. Indeed, ethical challenges include developing data accessibility and sharing strategies without violation of privacy of individuals and family members, achieving meaningful informed consent throughout the entire data lifecycle, avoiding uses of data that support actions of a discriminatory or inequitable nature, ensuring thorough and expert ethical oversight of projects, and appropriately handling any incidental findings from the data134, as well as issues regarding the challenge of protecting astronauts135,136. Just as the landscape of human spaceflight is diversifying in a positive and more inclusive manner, so too are the opportunities for improving precision healthcare in flight and on longer missions137. For example, with genetic risk data in hand, individuals could exercise increased autonomy in making informed decisions about participating in spaceflight activities. In this paper, we reviewed an example set of published alleles purportedly linked to protective effects, the biochemical pathways of which could inform therapeutic compound discovery and nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations to protect health during spaceflight missions and potentially during postflight recovery and stationing on planetary surfaces, including the Moon and Mars138. This guide can also help individuals on Earth in high-stress and environmentally challenging scenarios, such as first responders, cave explorers, radiation workers, deep-sea investigators, or commercial astronauts like the Inspiration4, Axoim Space, and Polaris Dawn missions91,139–147. Alongside any untapped potential to enhance both terrestrial and aerospace precision healthcare, investigation of such alleles poses significant technical and ethical challenges. If humanity safely and effectively surmounts these hurdles, the revamped aerospace health recommendations that ensue could be incorporated with other types of countermeasures (such as artificial gravity, faster spacecraft, radiation shielding, and biotechnology for food and material production) in order to best preserve the well-being of life during future deep space missions and interplanetary exploration.Supplementary information 41467_2024_49423_MOESM1_ESM.docx (7.1KB, docx) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1 (11.9KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 2 (38.3KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 1 References (14.2KB, docx) Supplementary Data 2 References (25.7KB, docx) Acknowledgements The authors thank Sergey Ponomarev (IBMP Russian Academy of Sciences), Raúl Herranz (Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas “Margarita Salas” (CSIC)), Liz Warren (Blue Origin), Ryan T.

    "abstract": "Abstract Planning long-term space flights necessarily includes issues of providing food for the crew. One of the areas of research is the development of technologies for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the “space production” of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition. The objects of the study were wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) kernels of the Super Dwarf cultivar. Of which, 100 kernels matured in outer space conditions in the Lada growth chamber on the International Space Station (ISS), and 85 kernels of the control wheat grown in a similar growth chamber under terrestrial conditions. It has been established that kernels from ISS have significant differences to a smaller extent in weight, area, length, and width of the kernel. However, the kernels under both conditions were predominantly large (the average weight of a kernel in space is 0.0362 g, and in terrestrial conditions—0.0376 g). The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even (coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 6–12%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5–8% higher than on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction When planning piloting beyond our planet and long-term space exploration, the possibility of obtaining food in a new place is taken into account, because delivery to Mars, the Moon, or a space station will be unreasonably high in cost, long, and irregular [1]. Therefore, ongoing work is underway to improve greenhouses with a controlled environment to ensure sustainable food security, as well as research into plants suitable for such conditions, primarily dwarf plants, and those with accelerated development [2]. Plants are selected that are resistant to high levels of ethylene, with a short period of obtaining marketable products, compact size, high productivity, and self-reproduction (from seed to seed) [3]. Plants in space can serve not only as a source of food, but also for the in situ production of pharmaceuticals, air regeneration, water recycling, and improving the mental health of astronauts [4,5,6]. In near space conditions, technologies have already been developed for producing plants from seed to seed using model plants, for example, Arabidopsis thaliana [7] and Brassica rapa [8], as well as cultivated annual plants of various families. The main crops consumed by humans are wheat, rice, corn, and sorghum [9]. Previously, attempts to grow cereals were sporadic and often ended in failure [2,10]. Currently, methods for cultivating wheat [11,12] have been developed (sorghum, due to the absence of dwarf forms, remains not yet relevant). The breakthrough in the cultivation of these crops is associated with overcoming pollination problems associated with certain development issues and gas requirements, particularly ethylene [13]. Currently, the range of dwarf forms of rice and wheat makes it possible to achieve sustainable results, both on the ISS [10] and on the name of the Tiangong Chinese station [14]. Kernel parameters such as length, width, weight, and shape make the most significant contribution in yield assessment [15]. The composition and ratio of different types of starch grains in the endosperm, as well as the protein content, mainly related to the quantity and characteristics of the formation of the aleurone layer, determine the quality criteria of the resulting flour and other processed products [2]. Quality assessment based on completion and the symmetry of kernels makes flour production predictable. Despite the fact that the very issue of obtaining a crop of cereals grown under near space conditions has now already been resolved, even with the use of genetic analysis [16,17], the issue of assessing crop quality, and, in particular, the symmetry of the grains still remains unstudied. The quality of the harvest is already checked on Earth. To identify clear patterns and long-term consequences, it is necessary to create express methods for diagnosing seed quality already in orbit. This must be accompanied by the development of non-destructive assessment methods to maintain the feasibility of using seeds in experiments. One such method could be phenotypic assessment and assessment of shape and color based on various pre-assessed indices. There have not yet been any studies on the asymmetry of plant organs grown in space, and we could not find the results of using hyperspectral analysis for these purposes. Due to the characteristics of cultivation and the possible action of various factors, wheat, grown in a growth chamber with conditionally full compliance with temperature, lighting, and humidity on the ISS, will be subject to a number of stressful influences to which they are poorly adapted: 24 h light; a constant, relatively warm temperature; and poor light quality. The major difference between the two environments is gravity. Because the wheat plants have phototropism, the effects on gravitropism on plant development were studied. Kernels of smaller weight, length, width, area, and perimeter will be formed in a such condition. This assumption was designated as hypothesis A. It was also hypothesized that the level of wheat kernel asymmetry would be higher on the ISS board (hypothesis B). A visual method for assessing the asymmetry of the kernel on a cross section of a kernel was previously proposed [18]. However, since the amount of grain collected on the ISS was limited, it was also necessary to develop a method for asymmetry evaluation without cutting into these unique accessions. A hypothesis was also assumed (hypothesis C) that there is a relationship between the asymmetry of the kernel and its main parameters, and the stronger the asymmetry, the lower the weight, since asymmetry is probably characteristic of puny (unfulfilled, immature) kernels.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Plant Material For the study, spring wheat of the Super Dwarf cultivar (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 42) was used. This variety (CMH79.481–1Y8B-2Y-2B-OY) was selected by Dr. Bruce G. Bugbee in 1984 at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico, because the variety showed high adaptive potential to hydroponics, high CO2 content, and artificial lighting [11]. Super Dwarf plant heights are 15–20 cm in the field and 25–30 cm in growth chambers, making it attractive for growing in space bioregenerative life support systems. The heredity of Super Dwarf contains the germplasm of T. sphaerococcum, so the kernels of this cultivar are approximately two times shorter and thicker than the kernels of the usual varieties [11]. 4.2. Conditions for Obtaining a Harvest from Super Dwarf Wheat On 8 August 2011, cosmonaut S.A. Volkov (ISS-28/29 expedition) sowed the Super Dwarf grains in two Lada greenhouses on the Russian segment of the International Space Station (ISS) (Figure 11). Figure 11. Open in a new tab Appearance of wheat plants in the Lada greenhouse on the ISS 10 June 2011.The growth chamber consists of a module for roots with Turface substrate (AIMCOR, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) and a leaf chamber for the above-ground parts of plants with mirror walls and fluorescent lamps [13]. Watering was carried out when the substrate humidity dropped below 90–96%; Osmokote long-acting fertilizers were applied once in an amount of 15 g for the entire volume of the substrate in the chamber. The temperature in the greenhouse was 22 °C, the photoperiod was around the clock (Figure 11). The ISS-grown wheat plants, although they showed some deviation from vertical growth, looked quite normal, retaining their elongation from roots to ears. Upright growth of the wheat plant on the ISS is likely caused by phototropism [40]. On 17 November 2011, the mature plants were harvested and placed into two plastic bags with silica gel fillers to remove residual moisture and delivered to Earth on the Soyuz TMA-02M manned transport spacecraft (Figure 12). Figure 12. Open in a new tab Harvested wheat plants delivered from the ISS on 23 November 2011.Wheat kernels of the same cultivar Super Dwarf, obtained in a similar Lada chamber in the ground laboratory, served as a control. To check the safety of kernels grown in 2011 using a hyperspectral camera, wheat was grown on the ground in 2023 under similar conditions. One hundred kernels from the ISS (in two bags of 50 pieces each) and 85 kernels of the control variant in paper bags were obtained from the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (Moscow, Russia) in 2022. 4.3. Determination of the Asymmetry of Kernels in a Non-Traumatic Manner 4.3.1. Method of Perpendiculars to the Axis of Symmetry at a Distance of 25, 50, and 75% of the Kernel Length from the Base The kernels of each option were individually poured from paper bags onto the scanning surface of an Epson Perfection V550 Photo scanner, and the kernels were covered with black thick paper on top. The distance between the kernels was increased or decreased so that they did not touch, and their shadows did not creep onto each other when processed in ImageJ v2023. Wherein, the kernels were not turned over. Images were acquired at 600 dpi resolution. The kernel may fall onto the scanning surface sideways or onto the area where the two sides of the endosperm meet (crease), taking into account the uneven balance of weight inside the kernel. If it falls to one side, it will not be possible to establish asymmetry, since the symmetry line of the crease will not be reflected correctly (Figure 13). When placing the kernel by the crease to the scanning surface, the length of the left and right sides of the kernel was measured in the middle (crossing approximately 50% of the length of the symmetry axis of the kernel), and closer to the edges (approximately at the level of 25 and 75% of the length of the symmetry axis of the kernel from the kernel base). Figure 13. Open in a new tab Location variants of kernels that fell onto the scanning surface by the crease zone. Line 1—axis of kernel symmetry; Lines 2 and 3—the length of the left and right sides of a kernel, intersecting the symmetry axis at the point of 50% of the length of the kernel; lines 4 and 5—the length of the left and right sides of the kernel, intersecting the axis of symmetry at the point of 25% of the length of the kernel; lines 6 and 7—the length of the left and right sides of the kernel, intersecting the axis of symmetry at the point of 75% of the kernel length from the base.First, the measurements of 15 kernels were recorded, and then the sample was increased to 30 kernels (15 control kernels, 15 from ISS). The presence of significant differences between the right and left sides of the kernel was checked using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method and additionally using the Mann–Whitney test.4.3.2. Method of Perpendiculars to the Axis of Symmetry through the Point of Attachment (Base) of the Kernel and the Zone of Crease The kernels were placed vertically, gluing the kernels to the sticky tape with the brush area. Each kernel was assigned its own serial number, which remained behind the kernel at subsequent stages of the study. The image from the microscope was displayed on a computer screen and photographs were taken using the RisingView program. Next, measurements were performed in the ImageJ program. If the kernel has a fairly clearly defined attachment point, an opening between the attachment point and the radicle, the radicle, then the distance from the vertices of the lobes to the axis of symmetry (L1 and L1’), from the edges to the axis through the attachment point (L2 and L2’), from the edges to the axis through the hole (L3 and L3’), from the edges to the axis through the radicle (L4 and L4’), the distance from the edge to the axis at an angle of 45% (L5 and L5’), because visually there is often asymmetry here (Figure 14). Figure 14. Open in a new tab Perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry at the base of the kernels (line 1). Where lines 2 and 3 (or for schematic purposes L1 and L1’) are the distance from the vertices of the lobes to the axis of symmetry; lines 4 and 5 (or L2 and L2’)—the distance from the edges to the axis through the attachment point; lines 6 and 7 (or L3 and L3’)—from the edges to the axis through the hole; lines 8 and 9 (or L4 and L4’)—from the edges to the axis through the radicle; lines 10 and 11 (or L5 and L5’)—the distance from the edge to the axis at an angle of 45%.If the hole was not expressed, then all distances were measured except for the lines that were perpendicular to the axis of symmetry through the hole, i.e., without L3 and L3’. If the protruding radicle was difficult to distinguish in the photo, then we used the Invert function in ImageJ to obtain a blue-colored photo in which the relief was more clearly visible (Figure 15). Figure 15. Open in a new tab Perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry at the base of the kernels (line 1). Where lines 2 and 3 (or schematically L1 and L1’ for schematic purposes) are the distance from the vertices of the lobes to the axis of symmetry; lines 4 and 5 (or L2 and L2’)—the distance from the edges to the axis through the attachment point; lines 6 and 7 (or L4 and L4’)—from the edges to the axis through the radicle; lines 8 and 9 (or L5 and L5’)—the distance from the edge to the axis at an angle of 45%.In this way, the lengths of the left and right sides of the base of the kernel were measured for 100 accessions from the ISS and 85 control accessions. The significance of the differences was determined using the t-test method. 4.4. Determining Descriptive Statistics for the Sample Each kernel was placed on the adhesive tape with its back facing up, i.e., the junction of the two sides of the endosperm downwards according to the previously assigned serial number. Next, we obtained images from an Epson Perfection V550 Photo scanner (Epson, Suwa, Japan) with a resolution of 600 dpi. In the ImageJ program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), we processed photographs and measured the area of the kernel (mm2), perimeter (mm), roundness index, length (mm), width (mm), depth of the kernel (from the point of the junction of the two lobes of the kernel to the abdominal side at cross section, mm), depth of crease (the distance from the top of the junction of the two sides of the kernel to the point of attachment of the kernel). The weight of the kernels was determined with an accuracy of 0.0001 g. The distribution of a sample was checked for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method. The significance of the differences between the control sample and kernels from ISS was determined using the t-test method in SPSS Statistics 25. 4.5. Calculation of Asymmetry Indicators The direction of asymmetry was calculated as the ratio of the length of one of the sides to the sum of the lengths of the left and right sides [30]. For example, the direction of asymmetry from the vertices of the lobes to the axis of symmetry (Figure 3 and Figure 4) was found as L1/(L1 + L1’). All calculated values of indices of directions were in the range from 0 to 1. An index of 0.5 indicates symmetry of the sides, and so, with an assumption of 5%, it can be assumed that indices of 0.48, 0.49, 0.51, and 0.52 also indicate symmetry. Calculated values from 0 to 0.48 show a shift of symmetry to the left, and values from 0.53 to 1 are considered to be right-directed. If 3–5 indices out of 5 have the same direction, then we take this direction as directionality, for example, 3 indices are left-directed, 1 index is right-directed, and 1 more indicates symmetry, then we consider the kernel to be left-directed. The direction of asymmetry to the left was found to be characteristic of kernels that were located on the right in a simple ear [18]. Indices of relative asymmetry and fluctuating asymmetry of kernel were calculated using the previously applied method [18]. The relationship of asymmetry indices with the main parameters of kernel was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation method in SPSS Statistics 25. 4.6. Comparison of Asymmetry Indices Obtained Using Both a Kernel Section and a Non-Traumatic Method Early studies showed that the sufficient sample size to establish the asymmetry of kernel was 15 kernels per variant [18]. In present work, 20 kernels per variant were used (ISS and control), including two groups—kernels with a hole between the point of attachment of the kernel and the radicle and without such a hole. The selection of kernels was carried out randomly due to the function in SPSS “formation of a random sample of a given size”. Samples with serial numbers selected by the program were cut in the middle across the kernel. Relative asymmetry indices, asymmetry directional indices, and the value of fluctuating asymmetry were determined [18]. Comparison of indices from the kernel section and using a non-traumatic technique was carried out using the Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney method in SPSS. 4.7. Scanning Electron Microscopy Microscopy of the kernels was performed using a Camscan scanning electron microscope (Cambridge Instruments, Cambridge, UK). The kernels were placed on a metal stage, treated with a thin layer of gold and palladium, and then photos of the endosperm were taken using a scanning electron microscope (10 nm, ×1000). Using the resulting photographs, the length and width of starch granules on sections of kernels and on cut prints (starch granules are separate from each other) were measured. Using the resulting photographs, the length and width of starch granules on sections of kernels and on prints of sections (starch granules are separate from each other) were measured. Forty kernels were studied, of which 10 kernels were filled kernels from the ISS, 10 kernels were puny kernels from the ISS, and 20 kernels were from Earth experiment. On each kernel, five photographs were randomly taken with magnification of 1000 and 1500 times. The normality of the distribution was checked by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method, and the means were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance. 4.8. Hyperspectral Imaging Hyperspectral images were obtained using the Synergotron Fenoscaner (Synergotron, Zagreb, Croatia) research complex, which includes a hyperspectral camera with scanning technology equipped with a branching module with a transmission grating with high diffraction efficiency and a camera based on a high-sensitivity matrix. This, coupled with the built-in scanning technology and auxiliary camera, overcomes the complex problems encountered with conventional hyperspectral cameras, such as external longitudinal scanning mechanism and difficult focus. Spectral range: 400–1000 nm, spectral resolution above 2.5 nm, 300 spectral channels. The image resolution was 1920 × 1920. Every 10 measurements, calibration measurements were taken on a white calibration panel coated with BaSO4. Image analysis was carried out using Gelion software (Gelion 1.0b.sh., Moscow, Russia—gelion.agro.msu.ru). Analysis of the approximation of the spectral curve of kernels to the reference values of the spectral profiles of the coloring substances of the kernel, specifically in this case anthocyanins (AnC) were analyzed, identified by the type of the spectral curve—the dependence of the spectral brightness on the wavelength. At the same time, the reference spectra were brought to a single brightness scale—reflection coefficients. Reflectance coefficient (r) is the ratio of reflected radiation to incident radiation in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The reflectance in a certain direction relative to the Earth’s surface is called spectral albedo. The NDVI index (normalized relative vegetation index)—a simple indicator of the amount of photosynthetically active biomass—was calculated using the formula (800 nm − 680 nm)/(800 nm + 680 nm). Vegetation index values range from 0.20 to 0.95.",
    "results": "2. Results The wheat plants obtained during the full-size experiment on the ISS and in the ground laboratory Lada greenhouse were harvested after reaching the full maturity stage. The kernels were husked from the ears, weighed, and stored under the same conditions. To determine the natural range of differences, visually determined parameters were assessed. At the same time, it was found that some of the kernels were larger in size and had a fully formed shape; some had signs of stunting, namely an uneven and asymmetrical shape. This scatter is typical for kernels formed on spikelets in different zones of the ear, wherein well-filled kernels were formed in the spikelets of the central part of the ear, and puny kernels were formed in the upper and lower parts. Another morphological phenomenon that needed to be taken into account was the presence of a through hole in some of the kernels, probably associated with unknown variability and peculiarities of the formation of the middle part of the endosperm. This feature can be noted for part of the grains as a characteristic feature both for kernels of Super Dwarf wheat grown in the field, and for kernels of wheat grown in Lada greenhouses under the conditions of a ground experiment and in low-Earth orbit under the conditions of the ISS. This hole was observed in both well-filled and puny kernels, that is, these signs were not related. The identified natural fluctuations of the signs of “puny/well-fulfilled” and the “presence/absence of a through hole” were taken into account when analyzing kernels and forming a sample for analysis. 2.1. Descriptive Statistics of Kernels It was found that wheat grown on the ISS has significantly smaller kernels by weight (by 0.0014 g), area (by 1.68 mm2), length (by 0.45 mm), and width (by 0.11 mm). However, the differences between the perimeter, depth, and roundness of the kernels are not statistically significant (Table 1), which partially confirms hypothesis A. Table 1.

There are 33 medium-sized (0.0312–0.0363 g) kernels with ISS and 13 control ones (Figure 1). Very large (0.0416–0.0467 g)—11 accessions from the ISS and 17 in the control variant. Figure 1.

In the control variant, kernels of medium, small, and large (14.0–15.6 mm2) sizes predominate—38, 19, and 18 pieces out of 85, respectively. Figure 2.

Checking for Kernel Asymmetry Using Non-Traumatic Methods A study of the first non-traumatic method for determining the asymmetry of kernel using the methods of perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry at points of 50, 25, and 75% of the kernel length on a sample of 15 kernels did not establish significant differences between the left and right sides of the kernel. Increasing the sample to 30 kernels led to an increase in the significance of the Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis coefficients, indicating that there were no significant differences between the left and right sides of the kernel. That is, this method is not able to detect asymmetry even in those grains in which it is visually present. The second method of comparing the length of the left and right sides of the kernel for all samples of the Super Dwarf cultivar using the t-test method showed that there are no differences only between the distances from the tops of the folds of the left and right sides of the endosperm to the axis of symmetry. When examining the samples separately, it was found that the left and right sides differ along all perpendiculars in kernels with ISS, while in the control variant there are no differences only between the distances from the tops of the folds of the left and right sides of the endosperm to the axis of symmetry. 2.3. Comparison of Asymmetry Indices Obtained from a Section of a Kernel and a Non-Traumatic Method Comparison of the lengths of perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry showed that there are no significant differences between the length of L1 on the cut and L1 in a non-traumatic way; the lengths of L1’, L2, L2’, L5, L5’ are also statistically the same when tested using both the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method and Mann–Whitney test (Figure 3). The lateral lobes form morphologically slightly before the central lobe. Thus, kernel defects and environmental stress often affect the central lobe (the angle between lines 10 and 11) more than the lateral lobes. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Comparison of the lengths of perpendiculars on a section of a kernel and a non-traumatic method. Thick lines indicate perpendiculars without significant differences. 2.4. Relationship between the Main Kernel Parameters and Asymmetry Indicators Obtained in a Non-Traumatic Manner In terms of the direction of asymmetry, in 42 kernels from ISS, a pronounced shift of indices to the left was observed. This may indicate that these kernels were located on the right in the ear. Also, in nine kernels, there was a clear shift to the right, thirty-two kernels were symmetrical, and, in seventeen kernels, this indicator could not be reliably determined (for example, two indices were shifted to the left, two indices were shifted to the right, and one was symmetrical). The control variant had 38 kernels with indices shifted to the left, 9—to the right, 27 have pronounced symmetry, and in 11 kernels the indicator could not be unambiguously determined. According to the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) scale developed by Aniskina et al. (2023) [18], kernels from the ISS and control ones have a low and very low level of asymmetry (Figure 4). For example, 48 kernels with a low level of asymmetry and 42 ones with a very low level were received from the ISS, while in the control ground variant there were 31 and 42 of these, respectively. The average level of FA (index 0.132–0.192) was in seven kernels from the ISS and in nine from the control ground variant, a high level of FA was in two kernels from the ISS and in three kernels from the ground experiment, and a very high (0.254–0.314) FA level was observed only in one kernel from the ISS. The t-test did not establish significant differences in fluctuating asymmetry between kernels from ISS and the control variant; that is, hypothesis B was not confirmed. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Correlation of kernels according to the level of fluctuating asymmetry in two experimental variants (ground control and space station).Correlation analysis of traits showed that there was a significant strong relationship between FA and relative asymmetry index 4 in both the control and cosmic kernels. The direction of asymmetry was strongly associated with index 3 in both treatments, and with index 5 in kernels from ISS. That is, to minimize labor costs and speed up calculations, it is enough to take measurements from the edges to the axis through the radicle (L4 and L4’) and from the edges to the axis through the hole (L3 and L3’); in addition, you can measure the distance from the edge to the axis at an angle of 45% (L5 and L5’). The relationship between the weight of the kernels, area, perimeter, roundness, length, and width with asymmetry indicators has not been established. That is, hypothesis C turned out to be incorrect. 2.5. Comparison of Starch Granules in Kernels from the ISS and from Ground Experiment It is customary to divide starch granules into type A (size < 10 µm) and type B (>10 µm). A comparison of the coefficients of variation for a scattering of starch granules of type A in kernels from the ISS and from Earth (ground experiment) showed that the greatest variability in length and width was present in matured (filled) kernels (Table 2). Granules of type B are more aligned, for example, the variability in the width of puny kernels was 46% for granules of type A, and half as much for granules of type B (21%). The indices of the length and width of type A granules for kernels from the ISS and from Earth are the same—11 and 14% for mature kernels, and 12 and 11% for puny ones. Table 2.

Also, the length and width of type B granules in puny kernels from Earth were significantly smaller. The roundness indices are the same within all types of granules, as well as the width of type A granules. Table 3.

An analysis of the ratio of granules showed that in kernels from the ISS there is 5% less type B starch in mature kernels than in the control ground variant, as well as in puny kernels—the difference with the Earth is 8% (Figure 5). In general, the distribution of the two types of granules in kernels from the Earth treatment was close to an equal ratio, but in kernels from the ISS there was a significant bias towards type A granules. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Distribution of starch grains by type of starch granules in %. The blue area is type A starch granules, the orange area is type B starch granules. Diagram 1—ISS, matured kernels; 2—ISS, puny kernels; 3—Earth, matured kernels; 4—Earth, puny kernels.Cells of the aleurone layer in wheat kernels from the ground treatment and from the ISS did not have significant differences in length (Table 4). However, the width of the cells in mature kernels from the ISS was significantly smaller (Table 4). Table 4.

The ratio of sizes, number of starch granules of various types, and their location are associated with varietal characteristics, predicted flour quality, cultivation characteristics, and the presence of pests. Due to the fact that under space flight conditions, as in laboratory conditions, the main control indicators such as humidity, lighting, nutrition were the same, and pests and diseases were not identified, it can be assumed that the differences could be caused by the specific location of the greenhouse. The shape, the ratio of the number of starch granules, as well as the binder and matrix, which is the remains of the cytoplasm, are indicators of the quality of the resulting flour and starch. The starch granules in the endosperm of the kernels had a structural organization characteristic of wheat. Large starch granules were inclusions formed in plastids and they formed a flat spindle-shaped structure, which was expressed in depressions located along the widest part. Smaller grains are also formed in plastids and their quantity affects the quality of starch and, therefore, flour. The forming granules in fully completed kernels under terrestrial conditions had a smooth surface with a depression on the side and smaller starch inclusions of type B. In kernels that have impaired development and pronounced asymmetry of the two sides, apparently associated with the peculiarities of formation, lack of nutrients, local disruption of the supply of nutrients, some disturbances in the shape, and ratio of starch granules deposits could be observed. Under cultivation conditions in ISS, small changes in shape in the granules, and significant disturbances in the quantity, ratio of granule types, and sizes in granules with an uneven and incompletely formed system of deposition of reserve substances was observed (Figure 6). A breakdown of the binding components could also be observed. Figure 6.

Shown are images of sections and enlarged fragments of the central part of the endosperm of kernels that had uniform development and a symmetrical shape (left), as well as kernels that had pronounced asymmetry (right). Additionally, two types of cores are given that are characteristic of this variety—having a dense structure in the middle part and characterized by an expanded through the hole. Enlarged fragments show typical areas of endosperm cells with two types of starch granules characteristic of wheat (A-type (Ag) and B-type (Bg)). 2.6. Comparison of Averaged Spectral Profiles Obtained Using Hyperspectral Imaging A series of photographs were taken, in each of which three kernels from each group were randomly selected. Next, graphs were obtained by averaging the spectral profiles (Figure 7). Visually, there were no obvious differences between these groups in the RGB format (R-640 nm, G-550 nm, B-460 nm). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Panel with fixed kernels used for hyperspectral analysis and the result of averaged data. The kernels of fresh harvest and kernels obtained in Lada greenhouses in laboratory conditions and on the ISS are presented.Based on the obtained averaged spectral profiles, we can conclude that the accessions from the control ground treatment and the treatment from ISS are as similar as possible to each other and their graphs almost completely repeat each other. The kernels in the ground treatment (Control 2. Earth) differed from the first two groups of kernels in that they had weaker reflection (r) in the red and near-infrared spectrum (650–800 nm). 2.7. Comparison of NDVI Indices of Kernels Obtained Using Hyperspectral Imaging The NDVI index was taken in the range from 0 to 3.75 for maximum clarity. In all the images below with the NDVI index overlaid, the kernels are from the Control 2. Earth treatment are visible on the left side (Figure 8). Based on these images, we can conclude that kernels after long-term storage have a lower vegetation index in contrast to kernels obtained from new resowing. The NDVI index was taken in the range from 0 to 3.75 for maximum visibility. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Results of hyperspectral analysis using the NDVI index to visualize kernels. Fresh harvest kernels and kernels obtained in Lada greenhouses in laboratory conditions and on the ISS are presented. 2.8. Comparison of Approximation Indices of the Kernel Spectral Profile to a Given Anthocyanin Standard The reference spectra are reduced to a brightness level from 0 to 1, therefore, to superimpose the brightness we obtained, the method of interpolating the spectral profile onto the reference anthocyanin profile was used (Figure 9). To obtain a single profile approximation index, an index was obtained, which was subsequently superimposed on the images to show the anthocyanin ratios in the original hyperspectral image. In all the images below with the Anthocyanin Index overlaid, AnC can be seen on the left side of the Control 2, Earth panel (Figure 9). From the analysis of the images with the index superimposed on them, it follows that the anthocyanin content in the kernels increases during storage (Figure 10). Figure 9.

    "discussion": "3. Discussion Providing for people during long space expeditions, when working on remote objects of deep and near space, poses significant challenges for agronomic support and necessarily encourage the creation of water reclamation systems, efficient use of nutrients, and a closed cycle of plant cultivation with mandatory reproduction of plant crops from seed to seed [6,19]. For the first time, this study describes a comparison of Super Dwarf wheat grown in a growth chamber in near space conditions on the ISS with wheat grown in a growth chamber on Earth. The Lada chamber was carefully designed so that the main difference between the treatments was gravity. The ISS-grown plants appeared visually normal, likely because phototropism responses under both treatments were similar. Since no major morphological changes in plant growth were observed, the accumulative effects of gravity were evaluated in the kernels produced under the two treatment conditions. Because the experiment could not be replicated, detailed studies were conducted to determine if differences between kernels produced in the two environments exist. However, the nature of those studies was restricted by both small sizes and non-damaging evaluations. It has been found that the simple scanning of a scattering of kernels is not suitable for a non-traumatic method of asymmetry determination. The presence of asymmetry can be detected by measuring the length of the left and right parts of the kernel, scanning (or photographing under a microscope) the base of the kernel. That is, of the two proposed methods, only the second is suitable—measuring the lengths of perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry through the point of attachment of the kernel and the zone of closure of the two lobes of the kernel. It was found that the weight, area, length, and width of the kernels from the plants grown in the ISS are less than those in the ground control, with statistically identical perimeters and roundness. Hypothesis A, that all parameters would be significantly lower, was put forward, but the hypothesis was only partially confirmed. A similar phenomenon was observed in a study of Arabidopsis seed coats—the size and number of cells inside the seed coat were statistically the same [20], as well as the number of lettuce leaves [14]. Also, the hypothesis regarding the distortion of the shape of the kernel (Hypotheses B and C) were not confirmed, although early studies mentioned various types of deviations, for example, chromosome breakage [21], inability to produce seeds [22,23], distorted and non-viable embryos [24], and morphological abnormalities [25]. This might be due to improved systems for growing plants—improved ventilation and watering systems. There are usually two types of starch granules in wheat kernels—A-type and B-type. They vary in size, shape, and composition. Thus, A-type starch granules have a biconvex shape; their size is more than 10 μm and they contain more amylose than B-type granules. The second type of granule is typically round in shape and size <10 μm [26,27,28,29]. Granules are widely present in the starchy endosperm of the kernel, where they are located within a protein matrix. In our study, this was also confirmed by the granule roundness indices. We have found that the length of starch granules in kernels from the ISS was significantly longer than that from accessions in the terrestrial treatment. Perhaps, this can be partially explained by the reaction of plants to small doses of stress, as was shown in the work with the influence of low salt concentrations on kernel parameters [30]. The baking properties of wheat are closely related to the composition (two types of glucose polymer, amylose, and amylopectin), structure, and morphology of starch granules, as well as storage proteins (gliadins and glutenins) of the grain, which determine the viscoelastic properties of the dough [31,32]. In mature endosperm, protein content is higher at the periphery of the kernel and decreases towards the central part (kernel cavity), and starch granules accumulate in exactly the opposite direction [33]. In a number of studies, the kernel was divided into nine successive layers (pearling method) and confirmed that differences in the spatial distribution of chemical components affect the quality of flour. Thus, bread from layers 3–6 had a higher loaf volume, specific volume, elasticity, and organoleptic characteristics [34]. Our study revealed that there are more type B granules in terrestrial experience; that is, it can be assumed that kernels from the ISS will be slightly inferior in baking quality. Also, changes in starch content under the conditions of space were reported in works on the seeds of Brassica rapa [8,35], pepper plants [36], and on the roots of the watercress Lepidium sativum L. [37], Arabidopsis [20]. The cells of the aleurone layer are rich in protein and triacylglycerols [32]. In our work, in the ripened wheat grains on the ISS, the width of the aleurone layer cells was significantly smaller in matured wheat kernels from the ISS (Hypothesis D was confirmed) than in the terrestrial experiment; therefore, they like have less of the protein component. Reduced protein levels in Brassica rapa seeds obtained under space station conditions were previously reported [8,35]. Also, Arabidopsis thaliana seeds had 54.73% fewer protein bodies than the ground control [20]. Researchers believe this is due to the harsh conditions of microgravity, such as increased ethylene content. The lack of natural ventilation in growth chambers can easily lead plants to oxygen starvation [38] and, as a consequence, to seed hypoxia. Some symptoms of oxygen deficiency are a reduction of protein bodies, abnormal deposition of starch granules, and thickening of cell walls [39]. When analyzing the qualitative differences between kernels obtained on Earth and in the ISS, both symmetrical and asymmetrical kernels were used with an emphasis on the starch inclusions of the endosperm, which are an indicator of the quality of starch and flour for wheat. No significant differences were found in the size and arrangement of starch grains in fully developed symmetrical kernels grown both on Earth and in space flight conditions. However, differences were observed both in the connecting elements of cytoplasmic residues and in the size, location, and ratio of A and B starch inclusions in kernels with manifested asymmetry. It can be argued that if optimal conditions are created under which developmental disorders will be absent, the quality of grain and flour will not differ from those on Earth. It is possible that the cause of this phenomenon may be the peculiarities of the manifestation of the physical properties of water in weightlessness, which do not allow us to completely simulate this phenomenon. Thus, the availability of water for plants and the technical device for its provision can be key indicators for yield obtaining under space flight conditions. This is confirmed by the changes in the epidermis and hairs on the surface that we described earlier [19]. In the future, prospects are seen in accelerating the determination of the asymmetry of kernels by introducing computer scanning and developing a system for placing grains in a vertical position. We also consider it promising to study the relationship between the chemical composition of the seeds and the asymmetry of the fruits using hyperspectral and computer scanning methods. The small differences in kernel characteristics observed in two treatments to which wheat plants are poorly adapted, constant temperature, 24 h light, and low gravity, suggests that wheat cultivars better adapted to non-earth conditions would be relatively easy to breed. Such plants would be better adapted to space conditions and would not require some genes involved in resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Because some of the genes used to limit crop losses on the earth do have adverse effects on plant vigor.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions The work presents, for the first time, data on the asymmetry of wheat kernels obtained in near space conditions, and also indicates the relationship of this parameter with other important characteristics of the kernel. It has been found that there were no significant differences between the main parameters of the kernels from the wheat plants grown on the ISS and on Earth. The number of type B starch granules in kernels from ISS was 5–8% less than in those obtained on Earth, and the width of the cells of the aleurone layer in kernels from ISS was significantly inferior to that obtained on Earth. Despite the fact that many parameters of the grains were statistically the same, a decrease in the protein component in the endosperm indicates a likely increase in stress components, gravity loss, water stress, and possibly some tissue hypoxia during the formation of space generation seeds; therefore, the growth chambers should be modified for better aeration. It should be noted that growing plants from seeds in space opens up prospects for sustainable food production and the stability of artificially created ecosystems not only during long space flights, but also in other closed-cycle conditions; for example, when creating stationary systems with extreme conditions on other planets, at base stations in the Arctic and Antarctic, high mountain areas, or at underground or underwater objects. The data presented make it possible to obtain valuable information about the asymmetry of the shape, protein, and starch composition of the kernel in the space environment. Continued research in this area will contribute to the development of space agriculture and the creation of a self-sustaining space habitat. The phototropic responses of plants are likely the main factor preventing drastic gravitational responses in space.",

Copyright notice ID: 10780891 PMID: 38202381 Abstract Planning long-term space flights necessarily includes issues of providing food for the crew. One of the areas of research is the development of technologies for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the “space production” of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition. The objects of the study were wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) kernels of the Super Dwarf cultivar. Of which, 100 kernels matured in outer space conditions in the Lada growth chamber on the International Space Station (ISS), and 85 kernels of the control wheat grown in a similar growth chamber under terrestrial conditions. It has been established that kernels from ISS have significant differences to a smaller extent in weight, area, length, and width of the kernel. However, the kernels under both conditions were predominantly large (the average weight of a kernel in space is 0.0362 g, and in terrestrial conditions—0.0376 g). The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even (coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 6–12%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5–8% higher than on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.

Introduction When planning piloting beyond our planet and long-term space exploration, the possibility of obtaining food in a new place is taken into account, because delivery to Mars, the Moon, or a space station will be unreasonably high in cost, long, and irregular [1]. Therefore, ongoing work is underway to improve greenhouses with a controlled environment to ensure sustainable food security, as well as research into plants suitable for such conditions, primarily dwarf plants, and those with accelerated development [2]. Plants are selected that are resistant to high levels of ethylene, with a short period of obtaining marketable products, compact size, high productivity, and self-reproduction (from seed to seed) [3]. Plants in space can serve not only as a source of food, but also for the in situ production of pharmaceuticals, air regeneration, water recycling, and improving the mental health of astronauts [4,5,6]. In near space conditions, technologies have already been developed for producing plants from seed to seed using model plants, for example, Arabidopsis thaliana [7] and Brassica rapa [8], as well as cultivated annual plants of various families. The main crops consumed by humans are wheat, rice, corn, and sorghum [9]. Previously, attempts to grow cereals were sporadic and often ended in failure [2,10]. Currently, methods for cultivating wheat [11,12] have been developed (sorghum, due to the absence of dwarf forms, remains not yet relevant). The breakthrough in the cultivation of these crops is associated with overcoming pollination problems associated with certain development issues and gas requirements, particularly ethylene [13]. Currently, the range of dwarf forms of rice and wheat makes it possible to achieve sustainable results, both on the ISS [10] and on the name of the Tiangong Chinese station [14]. Kernel parameters such as length, width, weight, and shape make the most significant contribution in yield assessment [15]. The composition and ratio of different types of starch grains in the endosperm, as well as the protein content, mainly related to the quantity and characteristics of the formation of the aleurone layer, determine the quality criteria of the resulting flour and other processed products [2]. Quality assessment based on completion and the symmetry of kernels makes flour production predictable. Despite the fact that the very issue of obtaining a crop of cereals grown under near space conditions has now already been resolved, even with the use of genetic analysis [16,17], the issue of assessing crop quality, and, in particular, the symmetry of the grains still remains unstudied. The quality of the harvest is already checked on Earth. To identify clear patterns and long-term consequences, it is necessary to create express methods for diagnosing seed quality already in orbit. This must be accompanied by the development of non-destructive assessment methods to maintain the feasibility of using seeds in experiments. One such method could be phenotypic assessment and assessment of shape and color based on various pre-assessed indices. There have not yet been any studies on the asymmetry of plant organs grown in space, and we could not find the results of using hyperspectral analysis for these purposes. Due to the characteristics of cultivation and the possible action of various factors, wheat, grown in a growth chamber with conditionally full compliance with temperature, lighting, and humidity on the ISS, will be subject to a number of stressful influences to which they are poorly adapted: 24 h light; a constant, relatively warm temperature; and poor light quality. The major difference between the two environments is gravity. Because the wheat plants have phototropism, the effects on gravitropism on plant development were studied. Kernels of smaller weight, length, width, area, and perimeter will be formed in a such condition. This assumption was designated as hypothesis A. It was also hypothesized that the level of wheat kernel asymmetry would be higher on the ISS board (hypothesis B). A visual method for assessing the asymmetry of the kernel on a cross section of a kernel was previously proposed [18]. However, since the amount of grain collected on the ISS was limited, it was also necessary to develop a method for asymmetry evaluation without cutting into these unique accessions. A hypothesis was also assumed (hypothesis C) that there is a relationship between the asymmetry of the kernel and its main parameters, and the stronger the asymmetry, the lower the weight, since asymmetry is probably characteristic of puny (unfulfilled, immature) kernels.2. Results The wheat plants obtained during the full-size experiment on the ISS and in the ground laboratory Lada greenhouse were harvested after reaching the full maturity stage. The kernels were husked from the ears, weighed, and stored under the same conditions. To determine the natural range of differences, visually determined parameters were assessed. At the same time, it was found that some of the kernels were larger in size and had a fully formed shape; some had signs of stunting, namely an uneven and asymmetrical shape. This scatter is typical for kernels formed on spikelets in different zones of the ear, wherein well-filled kernels were formed in the spikelets of the central part of the ear, and puny kernels were formed in the upper and lower parts. Another morphological phenomenon that needed to be taken into account was the presence of a through hole in some of the kernels, probably associated with unknown variability and peculiarities of the formation of the middle part of the endosperm. This feature can be noted for part of the grains as a characteristic feature both for kernels of Super Dwarf wheat grown in the field, and for kernels of wheat grown in Lada greenhouses under the conditions of a ground experiment and in low-Earth orbit under the conditions of the ISS. This hole was observed in both well-filled and puny kernels, that is, these signs were not related. The identified natural fluctuations of the signs of “puny/well-fulfilled” and the “presence/absence of a through hole” were taken into account when analyzing kernels and forming a sample for analysis. 2.1. Descriptive Statistics of Kernels It was found that wheat grown on the ISS has significantly smaller kernels by weight (by 0.0014 g), area (by 1.68 mm2), length (by 0.45 mm), and width (by 0.11 mm). However, the differences between the perimeter, depth, and roundness of the kernels are not statistically significant (Table 1), which partially confirms hypothesis A. Table 1.

There are 33 medium-sized (0.0312–0.0363 g) kernels with ISS and 13 control ones (Figure 1). Very large (0.0416–0.0467 g)—11 accessions from the ISS and 17 in the control variant. Figure 1.

In the control variant, kernels of medium, small, and large (14.0–15.6 mm2) sizes predominate—38, 19, and 18 pieces out of 85, respectively. Figure 2.

Checking for Kernel Asymmetry Using Non-Traumatic Methods A study of the first non-traumatic method for determining the asymmetry of kernel using the methods of perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry at points of 50, 25, and 75% of the kernel length on a sample of 15 kernels did not establish significant differences between the left and right sides of the kernel. Increasing the sample to 30 kernels led to an increase in the significance of the Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis coefficients, indicating that there were no significant differences between the left and right sides of the kernel. That is, this method is not able to detect asymmetry even in those grains in which it is visually present. The second method of comparing the length of the left and right sides of the kernel for all samples of the Super Dwarf cultivar using the t-test method showed that there are no differences only between the distances from the tops of the folds of the left and right sides of the endosperm to the axis of symmetry. When examining the samples separately, it was found that the left and right sides differ along all perpendiculars in kernels with ISS, while in the control variant there are no differences only between the distances from the tops of the folds of the left and right sides of the endosperm to the axis of symmetry.2.3. Comparison of Asymmetry Indices Obtained from a Section of a Kernel and a Non-Traumatic Method Comparison of the lengths of perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry showed that there are no significant differences between the length of L1 on the cut and L1 in a non-traumatic way; the lengths of L1’, L2, L2’, L5, L5’ are also statistically the same when tested using both the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method and Mann–Whitney test (Figure 3). The lateral lobes form morphologically slightly before the central lobe. Thus, kernel defects and environmental stress often affect the central lobe (the angle between lines 10 and 11) more than the lateral lobes. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Comparison of the lengths of perpendiculars on a section of a kernel and a non-traumatic method. Thick lines indicate perpendiculars without significant differences.2.4. Relationship between the Main Kernel Parameters and Asymmetry Indicators Obtained in a Non-Traumatic Manner In terms of the direction of asymmetry, in 42 kernels from ISS, a pronounced shift of indices to the left was observed. This may indicate that these kernels were located on the right in the ear. Also, in nine kernels, there was a clear shift to the right, thirty-two kernels were symmetrical, and, in seventeen kernels, this indicator could not be reliably determined (for example, two indices were shifted to the left, two indices were shifted to the right, and one was symmetrical). The control variant had 38 kernels with indices shifted to the left, 9—to the right, 27 have pronounced symmetry, and in 11 kernels the indicator could not be unambiguously determined. According to the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) scale developed by Aniskina et al. (2023) [18], kernels from the ISS and control ones have a low and very low level of asymmetry (Figure 4). For example, 48 kernels with a low level of asymmetry and 42 ones with a very low level were received from the ISS, while in the control ground variant there were 31 and 42 of these, respectively. The average level of FA (index 0.132–0.192) was in seven kernels from the ISS and in nine from the control ground variant, a high level of FA was in two kernels from the ISS and in three kernels from the ground experiment, and a very high (0.254–0.314) FA level was observed only in one kernel from the ISS. The t-test did not establish significant differences in fluctuating asymmetry between kernels from ISS and the control variant; that is, hypothesis B was not confirmed. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Correlation of kernels according to the level of fluctuating asymmetry in two experimental variants (ground control and space station).Correlation analysis of traits showed that there was a significant strong relationship between FA and relative asymmetry index 4 in both the control and cosmic kernels. The direction of asymmetry was strongly associated with index 3 in both treatments, and with index 5 in kernels from ISS. That is, to minimize labor costs and speed up calculations, it is enough to take measurements from the edges to the axis through the radicle (L4 and L4’) and from the edges to the axis through the hole (L3 and L3’); in addition, you can measure the distance from the edge to the axis at an angle of 45% (L5 and L5’). The relationship between the weight of the kernels, area, perimeter, roundness, length, and width with asymmetry indicators has not been established. That is, hypothesis C turned out to be incorrect.2.5. Comparison of Starch Granules in Kernels from the ISS and from Ground Experiment It is customary to divide starch granules into type A (size < 10 µm) and type B (>10 µm). A comparison of the coefficients of variation for a scattering of starch granules of type A in kernels from the ISS and from Earth (ground experiment) showed that the greatest variability in length and width was present in matured (filled) kernels (Table 2). Granules of type B are more aligned, for example, the variability in the width of puny kernels was 46% for granules of type A, and half as much for granules of type B (21%). The indices of the length and width of type A granules for kernels from the ISS and from Earth are the same—11 and 14% for mature kernels, and 12 and 11% for puny ones. Table 2.

Also, the length and width of type B granules in puny kernels from Earth were significantly smaller. The roundness indices are the same within all types of granules, as well as the width of type A granules. Table 3. Average values of the length and width of starch granules in kernels of wheat plants grown on the ISS and in the ground experiment.

An analysis of the ratio of granules showed that in kernels from the ISS there is 5% less type B starch in mature kernels than in the control ground variant, as well as in puny kernels—the difference with the Earth is 8% (Figure 5). In general, the distribution of the two types of granules in kernels from the Earth treatment was close to an equal ratio, but in kernels from the ISS there was a significant bias towards type A granules. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Distribution of starch grains by type of starch granules in %. The blue area is type A starch granules, the orange area is type B starch granules. Diagram 1—ISS, matured kernels; 2—ISS, puny kernels; 3—Earth, matured kernels; 4—Earth, puny kernels.Cells of the aleurone layer in wheat kernels from the ground treatment and from the ISS did not have significant differences in length (Table 4). However, the width of the cells in mature kernels from the ISS was significantly smaller (Table 4). Table 4.

The ratio of sizes, number of starch granules of various types, and their location are associated with varietal characteristics, predicted flour quality, cultivation characteristics, and the presence of pests. Due to the fact that under space flight conditions, as in laboratory conditions, the main control indicators such as humidity, lighting, nutrition were the same, and pests and diseases were not identified, it can be assumed that the differences could be caused by the specific location of the greenhouse. The shape, the ratio of the number of starch granules, as well as the binder and matrix, which is the remains of the cytoplasm, are indicators of the quality of the resulting flour and starch. The starch granules in the endosperm of the kernels had a structural organization characteristic of wheat. Large starch granules were inclusions formed in plastids and they formed a flat spindle-shaped structure, which was expressed in depressions located along the widest part. Smaller grains are also formed in plastids and their quantity affects the quality of starch and, therefore, flour. The forming granules in fully completed kernels under terrestrial conditions had a smooth surface with a depression on the side and smaller starch inclusions of type B. In kernels that have impaired development and pronounced asymmetry of the two sides, apparently associated with the peculiarities of formation, lack of nutrients, local disruption of the supply of nutrients, some disturbances in the shape, and ratio of starch granules deposits could be observed. Under cultivation conditions in ISS, small changes in shape in the granules, and significant disturbances in the quantity, ratio of granule types, and sizes in granules with an uneven and incompletely formed system of deposition of reserve substances was observed (Figure 6). A breakdown of the binding components could also be observed. Figure 6.

Shown are images of sections and enlarged fragments of the central part of the endosperm of kernels that had uniform development and a symmetrical shape (left), as well as kernels that had pronounced asymmetry (right). Additionally, two types of cores are given that are characteristic of this variety—having a dense structure in the middle part and characterized by an expanded through the hole. Enlarged fragments show typical areas of endosperm cells with two types of starch granules characteristic of wheat (A-type (Ag) and B-type (Bg)).2.6. Comparison of Averaged Spectral Profiles Obtained Using Hyperspectral Imaging A series of photographs were taken, in each of which three kernels from each group were randomly selected. Next, graphs were obtained by averaging the spectral profiles (Figure 7). Visually, there were no obvious differences between these groups in the RGB format (R-640 nm, G-550 nm, B-460 nm). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Panel with fixed kernels used for hyperspectral analysis and the result of averaged data. The kernels of fresh harvest and kernels obtained in Lada greenhouses in laboratory conditions and on the ISS are presented.Based on the obtained averaged spectral profiles, we can conclude that the accessions from the control ground treatment and the treatment from ISS are as similar as possible to each other and their graphs almost completely repeat each other. The kernels in the ground treatment (Control 2. Earth) differed from the first two groups of kernels in that they had weaker reflection (r) in the red and near-infrared spectrum (650–800 nm).2.7. Comparison of NDVI Indices of Kernels Obtained Using Hyperspectral Imaging The NDVI index was taken in the range from 0 to 3.75 for maximum clarity. In all the images below with the NDVI index overlaid, the kernels are from the Control 2. Earth treatment are visible on the left side (Figure 8). Based on these images, we can conclude that kernels after long-term storage have a lower vegetation index in contrast to kernels obtained from new resowing. The NDVI index was taken in the range from 0 to 3.75 for maximum visibility. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Results of hyperspectral analysis using the NDVI index to visualize kernels. Fresh harvest kernels and kernels obtained in Lada greenhouses in laboratory conditions and on the ISS are presented.2.8. Comparison of Approximation Indices of the Kernel Spectral Profile to a Given Anthocyanin Standard The reference spectra are reduced to a brightness level from 0 to 1, therefore, to superimpose the brightness we obtained, the method of interpolating the spectral profile onto the reference anthocyanin profile was used (Figure 9). To obtain a single profile approximation index, an index was obtained, which was subsequently superimposed on the images to show the anthocyanin ratios in the original hyperspectral image. In all the images below with the Anthocyanin Index overlaid, AnC can be seen on the left side of the Control 2, Earth panel (Figure 9). From the analysis of the images with the index superimposed on them, it follows that the anthocyanin content in the kernels increases during storage (Figure 10). Figure 9.

Discussion Providing for people during long space expeditions, when working on remote objects of deep and near space, poses significant challenges for agronomic support and necessarily encourage the creation of water reclamation systems, efficient use of nutrients, and a closed cycle of plant cultivation with mandatory reproduction of plant crops from seed to seed [6,19]. For the first time, this study describes a comparison of Super Dwarf wheat grown in a growth chamber in near space conditions on the ISS with wheat grown in a growth chamber on Earth. The Lada chamber was carefully designed so that the main difference between the treatments was gravity. The ISS-grown plants appeared visually normal, likely because phototropism responses under both treatments were similar. Since no major morphological changes in plant growth were observed, the accumulative effects of gravity were evaluated in the kernels produced under the two treatment conditions. Because the experiment could not be replicated, detailed studies were conducted to determine if differences between kernels produced in the two environments exist. However, the nature of those studies was restricted by both small sizes and non-damaging evaluations. It has been found that the simple scanning of a scattering of kernels is not suitable for a non-traumatic method of asymmetry determination. The presence of asymmetry can be detected by measuring the length of the left and right parts of the kernel, scanning (or photographing under a microscope) the base of the kernel. That is, of the two proposed methods, only the second is suitable—measuring the lengths of perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry through the point of attachment of the kernel and the zone of closure of the two lobes of the kernel. It was found that the weight, area, length, and width of the kernels from the plants grown in the ISS are less than those in the ground control, with statistically identical perimeters and roundness. Hypothesis A, that all parameters would be significantly lower, was put forward, but the hypothesis was only partially confirmed. A similar phenomenon was observed in a study of Arabidopsis seed coats—the size and number of cells inside the seed coat were statistically the same [20], as well as the number of lettuce leaves [14]. Also, the hypothesis regarding the distortion of the shape of the kernel (Hypotheses B and C) were not confirmed, although early studies mentioned various types of deviations, for example, chromosome breakage [21], inability to produce seeds [22,23], distorted and non-viable embryos [24], and morphological abnormalities [25]. This might be due to improved systems for growing plants—improved ventilation and watering systems. There are usually two types of starch granules in wheat kernels—A-type and B-type. They vary in size, shape, and composition. Thus, A-type starch granules have a biconvex shape; their size is more than 10 μm and they contain more amylose than B-type granules. The second type of granule is typically round in shape and size <10 μm [26,27,28,29]. Granules are widely present in the starchy endosperm of the kernel, where they are located within a protein matrix. In our study, this was also confirmed by the granule roundness indices. We have found that the length of starch granules in kernels from the ISS was significantly longer than that from accessions in the terrestrial treatment. Perhaps, this can be partially explained by the reaction of plants to small doses of stress, as was shown in the work with the influence of low salt concentrations on kernel parameters [30]. The baking properties of wheat are closely related to the composition (two types of glucose polymer, amylose, and amylopectin), structure, and morphology of starch granules, as well as storage proteins (gliadins and glutenins) of the grain, which determine the viscoelastic properties of the dough [31,32]. In mature endosperm, protein content is higher at the periphery of the kernel and decreases towards the central part (kernel cavity), and starch granules accumulate in exactly the opposite direction [33]. In a number of studies, the kernel was divided into nine successive layers (pearling method) and confirmed that differences in the spatial distribution of chemical components affect the quality of flour. Thus, bread from layers 3–6 had a higher loaf volume, specific volume, elasticity, and organoleptic characteristics [34]. Our study revealed that there are more type B granules in terrestrial experience; that is, it can be assumed that kernels from the ISS will be slightly inferior in baking quality. Also, changes in starch content under the conditions of space were reported in works on the seeds of Brassica rapa [8,35], pepper plants [36], and on the roots of the watercress Lepidium sativum L. [37], Arabidopsis [20]. The cells of the aleurone layer are rich in protein and triacylglycerols [32]. In our work, in the ripened wheat grains on the ISS, the width of the aleurone layer cells was significantly smaller in matured wheat kernels from the ISS (Hypothesis D was confirmed) than in the terrestrial experiment; therefore, they like have less of the protein component. Reduced protein levels in Brassica rapa seeds obtained under space station conditions were previously reported [8,35]. Also, Arabidopsis thaliana seeds had 54.73% fewer protein bodies than the ground control [20]. Researchers believe this is due to the harsh conditions of microgravity, such as increased ethylene content. The lack of natural ventilation in growth chambers can easily lead plants to oxygen starvation [38] and, as a consequence, to seed hypoxia. Some symptoms of oxygen deficiency are a reduction of protein bodies, abnormal deposition of starch granules, and thickening of cell walls [39]. When analyzing the qualitative differences between kernels obtained on Earth and in the ISS, both symmetrical and asymmetrical kernels were used with an emphasis on the starch inclusions of the endosperm, which are an indicator of the quality of starch and flour for wheat. No significant differences were found in the size and arrangement of starch grains in fully developed symmetrical kernels grown both on Earth and in space flight conditions. However, differences were observed both in the connecting elements of cytoplasmic residues and in the size, location, and ratio of A and B starch inclusions in kernels with manifested asymmetry. It can be argued that if optimal conditions are created under which developmental disorders will be absent, the quality of grain and flour will not differ from those on Earth. It is possible that the cause of this phenomenon may be the peculiarities of the manifestation of the physical properties of water in weightlessness, which do not allow us to completely simulate this phenomenon. Thus, the availability of water for plants and the technical device for its provision can be key indicators for yield obtaining under space flight conditions. This is confirmed by the changes in the epidermis and hairs on the surface that we described earlier [19]. In the future, prospects are seen in accelerating the determination of the asymmetry of kernels by introducing computer scanning and developing a system for placing grains in a vertical position. We also consider it promising to study the relationship between the chemical composition of the seeds and the asymmetry of the fruits using hyperspectral and computer scanning methods. The small differences in kernel characteristics observed in two treatments to which wheat plants are poorly adapted, constant temperature, 24 h light, and low gravity, suggests that wheat cultivars better adapted to non-earth conditions would be relatively easy to breed. Such plants would be better adapted to space conditions and would not require some genes involved in resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Because some of the genes used to limit crop losses on the earth do have adverse effects on plant vigor.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Plant Material For the study, spring wheat of the Super Dwarf cultivar (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 42) was used. This variety (CMH79.481–1Y8B-2Y-2B-OY) was selected by Dr. Bruce G. Bugbee in 1984 at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico, because the variety showed high adaptive potential to hydroponics, high CO2 content, and artificial lighting [11]. Super Dwarf plant heights are 15–20 cm in the field and 25–30 cm in growth chambers, making it attractive for growing in space bioregenerative life support systems. The heredity of Super Dwarf contains the germplasm of T. sphaerococcum, so the kernels of this cultivar are approximately two times shorter and thicker than the kernels of the usual varieties [11].4.2. Conditions for Obtaining a Harvest from Super Dwarf Wheat On 8 August 2011, cosmonaut S.A. Volkov (ISS-28/29 expedition) sowed the Super Dwarf grains in two Lada greenhouses on the Russian segment of the International Space Station (ISS) (Figure 11). Figure 11. Open in a new tab Appearance of wheat plants in the Lada greenhouse on the ISS 10 June 2011.The growth chamber consists of a module for roots with Turface substrate (AIMCOR, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) and a leaf chamber for the above-ground parts of plants with mirror walls and fluorescent lamps [13]. Watering was carried out when the substrate humidity dropped below 90–96%; Osmokote long-acting fertilizers were applied once in an amount of 15 g for the entire volume of the substrate in the chamber. The temperature in the greenhouse was 22 °C, the photoperiod was around the clock (Figure 11). The ISS-grown wheat plants, although they showed some deviation from vertical growth, looked quite normal, retaining their elongation from roots to ears. Upright growth of the wheat plant on the ISS is likely caused by phototropism [40]. On 17 November 2011, the mature plants were harvested and placed into two plastic bags with silica gel fillers to remove residual moisture and delivered to Earth on the Soyuz TMA-02M manned transport spacecraft (Figure 12). Figure 12. Open in a new tab Harvested wheat plants delivered from the ISS on 23 November 2011.Wheat kernels of the same cultivar Super Dwarf, obtained in a similar Lada chamber in the ground laboratory, served as a control. To check the safety of kernels grown in 2011 using a hyperspectral camera, wheat was grown on the ground in 2023 under similar conditions. One hundred kernels from the ISS (in two bags of 50 pieces each) and 85 kernels of the control variant in paper bags were obtained from the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (Moscow, Russia) in 2022.4.3. Determination of the Asymmetry of Kernels in a Non-Traumatic Manner 4.3.1. Method of Perpendiculars to the Axis of Symmetry at a Distance of 25, 50, and 75% of the Kernel Length from the Base The kernels of each option were individually poured from paper bags onto the scanning surface of an Epson Perfection V550 Photo scanner, and the kernels were covered with black thick paper on top. The distance between the kernels was increased or decreased so that they did not touch, and their shadows did not creep onto each other when processed in ImageJ v2023. Wherein, the kernels were not turned over. Images were acquired at 600 dpi resolution. The kernel may fall onto the scanning surface sideways or onto the area where the two sides of the endosperm meet (crease), taking into account the uneven balance of weight inside the kernel. If it falls to one side, it will not be possible to establish asymmetry, since the symmetry line of the crease will not be reflected correctly (Figure 13). When placing the kernel by the crease to the scanning surface, the length of the left and right sides of the kernel was measured in the middle (crossing approximately 50% of the length of the symmetry axis of the kernel), and closer to the edges (approximately at the level of 25 and 75% of the length of the symmetry axis of the kernel from the kernel base). Figure 13. Open in a new tab Location variants of kernels that fell onto the scanning surface by the crease zone. Line 1—axis of kernel symmetry; Lines 2 and 3—the length of the left and right sides of a kernel, intersecting the symmetry axis at the point of 50% of the length of the kernel; lines 4 and 5—the length of the left and right sides of the kernel, intersecting the axis of symmetry at the point of 25% of the length of the kernel; lines 6 and 7—the length of the left and right sides of the kernel, intersecting the axis of symmetry at the point of 75% of the kernel length from the base.First, the measurements of 15 kernels were recorded, and then the sample was increased to 30 kernels (15 control kernels, 15 from ISS). The presence of significant differences between the right and left sides of the kernel was checked using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method and additionally using the Mann–Whitney test.4.3.2. Method of Perpendiculars to the Axis of Symmetry through the Point of Attachment (Base) of the Kernel and the Zone of Crease The kernels were placed vertically, gluing the kernels to the sticky tape with the brush area. Each kernel was assigned its own serial number, which remained behind the kernel at subsequent stages of the study. The image from the microscope was displayed on a computer screen and photographs were taken using the RisingView program. Next, measurements were performed in the ImageJ program. If the kernel has a fairly clearly defined attachment point, an opening between the attachment point and the radicle, the radicle, then the distance from the vertices of the lobes to the axis of symmetry (L1 and L1’), from the edges to the axis through the attachment point (L2 and L2’), from the edges to the axis through the hole (L3 and L3’), from the edges to the axis through the radicle (L4 and L4’), the distance from the edge to the axis at an angle of 45% (L5 and L5’), because visually there is often asymmetry here (Figure 14). Figure 14. Open in a new tab Perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry at the base of the kernels (line 1). Where lines 2 and 3 (or for schematic purposes L1 and L1’) are the distance from the vertices of the lobes to the axis of symmetry; lines 4 and 5 (or L2 and L2’)—the distance from the edges to the axis through the attachment point; lines 6 and 7 (or L3 and L3’)—from the edges to the axis through the hole; lines 8 and 9 (or L4 and L4’)—from the edges to the axis through the radicle; lines 10 and 11 (or L5 and L5’)—the distance from the edge to the axis at an angle of 45%.If the hole was not expressed, then all distances were measured except for the lines that were perpendicular to the axis of symmetry through the hole, i.e., without L3 and L3’. If the protruding radicle was difficult to distinguish in the photo, then we used the Invert function in ImageJ to obtain a blue-colored photo in which the relief was more clearly visible (Figure 15). Figure 15. Open in a new tab Perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry at the base of the kernels (line 1). Where lines 2 and 3 (or schematically L1 and L1’ for schematic purposes) are the distance from the vertices of the lobes to the axis of symmetry; lines 4 and 5 (or L2 and L2’)—the distance from the edges to the axis through the attachment point; lines 6 and 7 (or L4 and L4’)—from the edges to the axis through the radicle; lines 8 and 9 (or L5 and L5’)—the distance from the edge to the axis at an angle of 45%.In this way, the lengths of the left and right sides of the base of the kernel were measured for 100 accessions from the ISS and 85 control accessions. The significance of the differences was determined using the t-test method.4.4. Determining Descriptive Statistics for the Sample Each kernel was placed on the adhesive tape with its back facing up, i.e., the junction of the two sides of the endosperm downwards according to the previously assigned serial number. Next, we obtained images from an Epson Perfection V550 Photo scanner (Epson, Suwa, Japan) with a resolution of 600 dpi. In the ImageJ program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), we processed photographs and measured the area of the kernel (mm2), perimeter (mm), roundness index, length (mm), width (mm), depth of the kernel (from the point of the junction of the two lobes of the kernel to the abdominal side at cross section, mm), depth of crease (the distance from the top of the junction of the two sides of the kernel to the point of attachment of the kernel). The weight of the kernels was determined with an accuracy of 0.0001 g. The distribution of a sample was checked for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method. The significance of the differences between the control sample and kernels from ISS was determined using the t-test method in SPSS Statistics 25.4.5. Calculation of Asymmetry Indicators The direction of asymmetry was calculated as the ratio of the length of one of the sides to the sum of the lengths of the left and right sides [30]. For example, the direction of asymmetry from the vertices of the lobes to the axis of symmetry (Figure 3 and Figure 4) was found as L1/(L1 + L1’). All calculated values of indices of directions were in the range from 0 to 1. An index of 0.5 indicates symmetry of the sides, and so, with an assumption of 5%, it can be assumed that indices of 0.48, 0.49, 0.51, and 0.52 also indicate symmetry. Calculated values from 0 to 0.48 show a shift of symmetry to the left, and values from 0.53 to 1 are considered to be right-directed. If 3–5 indices out of 5 have the same direction, then we take this direction as directionality, for example, 3 indices are left-directed, 1 index is right-directed, and 1 more indicates symmetry, then we consider the kernel to be left-directed. The direction of asymmetry to the left was found to be characteristic of kernels that were located on the right in a simple ear [18]. Indices of relative asymmetry and fluctuating asymmetry of kernel were calculated using the previously applied method [18]. The relationship of asymmetry indices with the main parameters of kernel was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation method in SPSS Statistics 25.4.6. Comparison of Asymmetry Indices Obtained Using Both a Kernel Section and a Non-Traumatic Method Early studies showed that the sufficient sample size to establish the asymmetry of kernel was 15 kernels per variant [18]. In present work, 20 kernels per variant were used (ISS and control), including two groups—kernels with a hole between the point of attachment of the kernel and the radicle and without such a hole. The selection of kernels was carried out randomly due to the function in SPSS “formation of a random sample of a given size”. Samples with serial numbers selected by the program were cut in the middle across the kernel. Relative asymmetry indices, asymmetry directional indices, and the value of fluctuating asymmetry were determined [18]. Comparison of indices from the kernel section and using a non-traumatic technique was carried out using the Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney method in SPSS.4.7. Scanning Electron Microscopy Microscopy of the kernels was performed using a Camscan scanning electron microscope (Cambridge Instruments, Cambridge, UK). The kernels were placed on a metal stage, treated with a thin layer of gold and palladium, and then photos of the endosperm were taken using a scanning electron microscope (10 nm, ×1000). Using the resulting photographs, the length and width of starch granules on sections of kernels and on cut prints (starch granules are separate from each other) were measured. Using the resulting photographs, the length and width of starch granules on sections of kernels and on prints of sections (starch granules are separate from each other) were measured. Forty kernels were studied, of which 10 kernels were filled kernels from the ISS, 10 kernels were puny kernels from the ISS, and 20 kernels were from Earth experiment. On each kernel, five photographs were randomly taken with magnification of 1000 and 1500 times. The normality of the distribution was checked by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method, and the means were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance.4.8. Hyperspectral Imaging Hyperspectral images were obtained using the Synergotron Fenoscaner (Synergotron, Zagreb, Croatia) research complex, which includes a hyperspectral camera with scanning technology equipped with a branching module with a transmission grating with high diffraction efficiency and a camera based on a high-sensitivity matrix. This, coupled with the built-in scanning technology and auxiliary camera, overcomes the complex problems encountered with conventional hyperspectral cameras, such as external longitudinal scanning mechanism and difficult focus. Spectral range: 400–1000 nm, spectral resolution above 2.5 nm, 300 spectral channels. The image resolution was 1920 × 1920. Every 10 measurements, calibration measurements were taken on a white calibration panel coated with BaSO4. Image analysis was carried out using Gelion software (Gelion 1.0b.sh., Moscow, Russia—gelion.agro.msu.ru). Analysis of the approximation of the spectral curve of kernels to the reference values of the spectral profiles of the coloring substances of the kernel, specifically in this case anthocyanins (AnC) were analyzed, identified by the type of the spectral curve—the dependence of the spectral brightness on the wavelength. At the same time, the reference spectra were brought to a single brightness scale—reflection coefficients. Reflectance coefficient (r) is the ratio of reflected radiation to incident radiation in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The reflectance in a certain direction relative to the Earth’s surface is called spectral albedo. The NDVI index (normalized relative vegetation index)—a simple indicator of the amount of photosynthetically active biomass—was calculated using the formula (800 nm − 680 nm)/(800 nm + 680 nm). Vegetation index values range from 0.20 to 0.95.5. Conclusions The work presents, for the first time, data on the asymmetry of wheat kernels obtained in near space conditions, and also indicates the relationship of this parameter with other important characteristics of the kernel. It has been found that there were no significant differences between the main parameters of the kernels from the wheat plants grown on the ISS and on Earth. The number of type B starch granules in kernels from ISS was 5–8% less than in those obtained on Earth, and the width of the cells of the aleurone layer in kernels from ISS was significantly inferior to that obtained on Earth. Despite the fact that many parameters of the grains were statistically the same, a decrease in the protein component in the endosperm indicates a likely increase in stress components, gravity loss, water stress, and possibly some tissue hypoxia during the formation of space generation seeds; therefore, the growth chambers should be modified for better aeration. It should be noted that growing plants from seeds in space opens up prospects for sustainable food production and the stability of artificially created ecosystems not only during long space flights, but also in other closed-cycle conditions; for example, when creating stationary systems with extreme conditions on other planets, at base stations in the Arctic and Antarctic, high mountain areas, or at underground or underwater objects. The data presented make it possible to obtain valuable information about the asymmetry of the shape, protein, and starch composition of the kernel in the space environment. Continued research in this area will contribute to the development of space agriculture and the creation of a self-sustaining space habitat. The phototropic responses of plants are likely the main factor preventing drastic gravitational responses in space.Acknowledgments Thanks to: Roscosmos and cosmonaut Sergey Volkov.

To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.

    "introduction": "Introduction Crop production in space may be a necessary and desirable component of future exploration systems (MacElroy et al., 1992; Kliss et al., 2000). Fresh produce can be grown in situ to supplement a stored, packaged diet, and crops may provide beneficial nutrients as well as dietary variety. Veggie is a small plant growth chamber designed and built by Orbital Technologies Corporation (Now Sierra Nevada Corp., Madison, WI, United States) to grow vegetable crops in space (Morrow et al., 2005; Morrow and Remiker, 2009). The first Veggie plant growth chamber was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in April, 2014 along with eighteen plant (rooting) pillows for the VEG-01 experiment. Veggie is a simple plant growth facility that uses LED lights and fans to circulate ISS air through the plant growth volume. A transparent, extensible bellows attached to the light unit via magnets contains the growing plants and any debris, and directs air flow from the bottom of the canopy to the top of the growth volume (Figure 1). Screens remove large particles from the cabin air before it passes through the plant growth chamber, however, no level of filtration is present, so plants growing in Veggie are exposed to any microbial or chemical constituents present in the ISS environment. More details about the Veggie facility can be found in Massa et al. (2016). For the VEG-01 and VEG-03 demonstration tests, plants were grown from seeds in plant pillows. Plant pillows are small growing bags that interact with a root mat water reservoir on the Veggie baseplate. Pillows contain a calcined clay substrate mixed with controlled release fertilizer and wicks for seed attachment. Surface sanitized seeds are glued into these plant pillow wicks, and pillows are packaged for flight under sterile air. Further details of seed and pillow preparation are provided by Massa et al. (2017b). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Veggie payload containing a crop of mature red romaine lettuce in Veggie pillows aboard the ISS with the light panel off (left) and red light panel on (right). Bellows are in the up position. A major focus of our research in the past several years has been to identify crop candidates with high potential for dietary supplementation, given the constraints associated with the current space diet. Ongoing testing has indicated that some essential human nutrients are either deficient in the processed and pre-packaged space foods (e.g., potassium, Vitamin K) or may degrade to inadequate levels over the times required for long duration missions (e.g., Vitamin B1, Vitamin C) (Cooper, 2013). Several of these nutrients may be supplemented through fresh salad crops and will provide antioxidants and phytochemicals in a natural, whole-food form. Previous studies with salad crops have focused on combinations of environmental conditions (e.g., light, temperature, CO2 concentration) needed to optimize plant growth for space settings (Richards et al., 2004, 2006). While the macro nutritional value of crops was often evaluated in productivity studies (calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates), micro nutritional data are limited (McKeehen et al., 1996; Wheeler et al., 1996, 1997). In order to utilize “pick-and-eat” produce such as the lettuce crops grown in VEG-01 and 03 as a supplemental food for space, nutritional assessment is essential. In this study we compare the nutritional quality of red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa, cv. Outredgeous) grown on ISS to ground controls grown under the same ISS environmental conditions including relative humidity, CO2 concentration and temperature. Within a Veggie chamber, conditions such as humidity and temperature can vary from ISS conditions outside the chamber, for example, the temperature and humidity inside the Veggie tend to be slightly elevated compared to the open cabin air. These differences may have an impact on the elemental, nutritional and microbiological components of the plant. Increased temperatures have been shown to decrease macronutrient content in red leaf lettuce while increasing flavonoids and phenolics (Sublett et al., 2018). Studies have shown that increased humidity initiates a positive response in biomass yield in many agricultural crops while concomitantly decreasing transpiration rate altering the uptake of water and some nutrients (Tibbitts, 1979; Gislerød and Mortensen, 1990). Microbiological testing is an integral part of any food safety program to verify quality, production and proper handling processes but few studies exist for space grown plants (Hummerick et al., 2010). We conducted microbiological testing of Veggie-grown produce to understand potential risks to astronauts as consumers. Good agricultural practices and procedures are in place to minimize microbial contamination of crops grown in Veggie, and microbial testing is one tool to verify the effectiveness of these processes (Hummerick et al., 2011). Plant-growth conditions, the surrounding environment, mineral nutrition, and plant species can all influence the microbial populations living on plant surfaces (Lindow and Brandl, 2003). A variety of microorganisms can be found on fresh produce, most as part of the normal flora of the plant with no adverse effect on humans if consumed (Heaton and Jones, 2008; Leff and Fierer, 2013; Oyinlola et al., 2017). Microbiological analysis can also provide insight on the microbial ecology (population density and types of bacteria and fungi) of Veggie-grown plants. The likelihood of contamination and growth of potential human pathogens on plants grown in Veggie is low since sterilization/sanitization of seeds, plant growth medium, irrigation water, and hardware can be controlled. However, if a contamination event were to occur, the risks to the crew of exposure to food borne pathogens could be increased considering the association of immune dysregulation to spaceflight (Borchers et al., 2002). Heterotrophic bacterial counts and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae that serve as an indicator of contamination of processed foods, irrigation water, and food processing surfaces are frequently present in raw foods like fresh produce making those tests irrelevant as risk indicators for fruits and vegetables (Heaton and Jones, 2008; Leff and Fierer, 2013). The microbial load on crops intended for consumption by astronauts presumably should fall within an acceptable range of microbiological standards set for food. Currently, however, there are no standards in place for microbial levels in fresh produce grown in space. The closest related NASA standards are for non-thermostabilized food items including any of the freeze dried foods consumed in orbit, e.g., shrimp cocktail, chocolate candy, granola bars. For example, the current limit for aerobic bacteria on a non-thermostabilized food item is <2 × 104 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram on one sample or <1 × 104 on two out of five samples (Perchonok et al., 2012) however, these standards apply to prepackaged food sent from Earth. For fresh produce grown on ISS, the microbiological acceptability is assessed on a case-by-case basis relying on microbiological analysis of crops grown in ground studies analogous to Veggie grown crops. Microbiological analysis has been performed previously on edible plants grown in the Russian Lada chamber on ISS (Hummerick et al., 2010, 2011). Mizuna, barley and radish from Lada were stored at −80°C after harvest until analysis was performed at Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States. A range of microbial densities as indicated by aerobic bacterial and fungal plate counts was found depending on plant type and location. The four samples of mizuna, the only leafy green tested, were grown in different Lada root modules at different times and counts ranged from 3.1 × 103 – 8.7 × 105. When compared to field grown or market produce of similar types these numbers are well within the expected range of microbial densities or even lower (Holvoet et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015; Fröhling et al., 2018; Hummerick et al., unpublished data). However, not all microorganisms can be cultured in the laboratory and alternate methods of community characterization are needed (Byrd et al., 1991; Schaule et al., 1993; Kalmbach et al., 1997). Genomic DNA analysis using whole genome or amplicon sequencing provides the capability of identifying 98–99% of the microbes present in a complex, heterogeneous microbial community. With the current advances in technology, the Illumina MiSeq provided a platform for capturing the community structure of the leaf and root material returned from the ISS and for the ground control samples. Identifying the community makeup is the first step in understanding the complex structure and interactions between mutualistic or symbiotic partners in plant growth systems. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ISS and Veggie environmental conditions on the microbiological and nutritional quality of Veggie grown lettuce intended for crew consumption.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Plant Growth and Harvest The Veggie production system on ISS is a small plant growth chamber designed and built by ORBITEC (Madison, WI, United States) to grow crops in space (Morrow et al., 2005; Morrow and Remiker, 2009). The Veggie production system, equipped with LED lighting and a passive watering system, launched to the ISS in 2014 aboard Space X’s third Commercial Resupply (CRS-3) mission (Figure 1). Red romaine lettuce Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’ was grown in Veggie rooting pillows as described by Massa et al. (2017a). Briefly, plants were grown in Veggie pillows containing solid, porous, arcillite (calcined clay) substrate in two different blends, either 100% sized to 600 μ–1 mm or a 1:1 ratio of that size to 1–2 mm (Turface Proleague, Profile Products, LLC) and controlled release fertilizer (Nutricote 18-6-8, type 180, Florikan, Sarasota, FL, United States). Procedures for detailed substrate and pillow preparation are outlined in Massa et al. (2017b). Two surface sanitized seeds were attached with guar in each plant pillow between paired germination wicks. All plant rooting pillows with attached seeds were kept dry in heat sealed, gas-impermeable Tedlar bags until test initiation on the ISS. Seeds for three separate, independent plantings (biological replicates) were germinated and grown for 33–56 days on ISS and ground controls were run in controlled environment chambers under ISS environmental conditions with a 24 h delay for VEG-01A and B and a 72 h delay for VEG-03A. Each experiment began with six rooting pillows. Germinated seeds were thinned to one plant per pillow at day 7. Each independent planting was grown at different times aboard ISS with parallel ground experiments for comparison (Table 1). TABLE 1. Initiation and harvest schedule of red romaine lettuce crop in Veggie aboard ISS. Experiment Initiation date Harvest date VEG-01A 5/8/2014 6/10/2014 (Day 33) VEG-OIB 7/8/2015 8/10/2015 (Day 33) VEG-03A 10/25/2016 2nd 12/09/2016 4th 12/28/2016 Open in a new tab Ground controls were harvested 1 day later for VEG-01 and 3 days later for VEG-03.VEG-01A was grown from May 8 to June 10, 2014; VEG-01B was grown from July 8 to August 10, 2015, and VEG-03A was grown from October 25 to December 28, 2016. VEG-01A and B were harvested after 33 days of growth using sanitized scissors to remove the leaves (Table 1). VEG-03A leaves were harvested sequentially starting at 33 days followed by 3 weekly harvests. Harvested leaves from each plant were wrapped in foil and placed into a −80°C freezer. The first, third, and half of the fourth harvests were consumed by the crew. Only the 2nd harvest and the remaining leaves (approximately half of the total leaves) of the final harvest from VEG-03A were stored for sample return. After completion of the final harvest for all three plantings, two rooting pillows from each independent experiment were removed from Veggie hardware and placed into bags and frozen at −80°C. Ground control samples were processed and stored the same as flight samples. The Veggie baseplate was positioned 30.5–31.75 cm below the LED light array to provide approximately 200 μmol⋅m2⋅s–1of photosynthetically active radiation at the surface of the pillows in the center of the Veggie unit at a ratio of 12 red (630 nm): 3 Blue (455 nm): 1 green (530 nm). A photoperiod was set to 16 h light/8 h dark. Environmental conditions from the three experiments are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Both the VEG-01A and part of the VEG-03A experiment on ISS had data collected inside the Veggie chamber using a temperature and relative humidity data logger. Sample Processing After return to Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States samples from all three experiments were maintained in a −80°C freezer until analysis. Plant samples were removed from the freezer and processed immediately while pillows were thawed at 4°C overnight. Leaf biomass was divided for microbiological and chemical analysis. The samples intended for chemical analysis were subsequently frozen at −80°C, freeze dried, then ground up using an IKA Tekmar A10 Analytical Grinding Mill. Roots were removed from each pillow and divided for microbiological and molecular analysis. Microbiological Analysis Leaf and pillow root samples were placed into sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with glass beads, weighed then shaken vigorously for 2 min. Sample extracts were diluted into PBS and appropriate dilutions were plated in duplicate onto trypticase soy agar (TSA) and inhibitory mold agar (IMA). Plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h for TSA and 72–120 h for IMA before enumeration of colonies. Individual colony phenotypes were selected for each sample and streaked for isolation. Isolated bacterial colonies were identified using the Micro Id System (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) or MicroSEQ 16S rDNA sequencing kit for bacteria (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Fungal colonies were identified using the MicroSEQ D2 LSU rDNA kit for fungi (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Sequencing was completed on the ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Bacterial and fungal DNA sequences were identified using MicroSEQ ID Software V2.0 (Bacterial Library, 2009; Fungal Library, 2011, Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, United States) and/or  Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). For microbial food safety screening, sample extracts were plated onto E. coli/coliform and Staph Express Petrifilm (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Petrifilms were incubated at 35°C for 24 h and colonies positive for E. coli and S. aureus were enumerated. Coliform colonies, if present, were re-isolated and further identified using Biolog GEN III plates. Screening for Salmonella was done by inoculating buffered peptone water (BPW) with 1 ml of sample extract followed by incubation at 35°C for 24 h. For selective enrichment, 1 ml of the incubated BPW was transferred into 5 ml of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) broth or Tetrathionate broth (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and incubated for 24 h at 35°C. Broths were then streaked onto selective media for Salmonella and incubated at 35°C for 24–48 h. These methods were adapted from the FDA bacteriological analytical manual (FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018). Microbial DNA Isolation, 16S and ITS PCR, and Sequencing DNA was isolated from sample material processed for microbiological analysis described above. Each sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm to pellet microbial cells, suspended in RNAlater and stored at −80°C until processing for DNA isolation was completed. DNA was extracted from plant leaf and root material of the Veggie pillows using the Microbial Cell DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Inc, Carlsbad, CA, United States) then quantified using the Qubit 2.0 double stranded DNA assay (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States). The variable 4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) was selected as a phylogenetic marker to identify microorganisms taxonomically to the species level. A dual indexing system for multiplexing was adapted for these communities and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was optimized for reagent concentrations and volume. Each community was labeled with two barcoded primers for identification at completion of sequencing. Amplicons were created in triplicate using 1 ng of template DNA, and final reagent concentrations of 1X buffer, 200 μM dNTP’s, 25 mM MgCl2, and 300 nM each barcoded 16S rRNA gene primer for bacterial identification or barcoded ITS primers for fungal identification (Bokulich and Mills, 2013; Kozich et al., 2013). The PCR cycling conditions were 95°C for 5 min to denature the Taq polymerase enzyme, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 58°C for annealing and 72°C for 2 min for extension. A final 10 min extension of 72°C completed the PCR run on a Bio-Rad C-1000 thermocycler. After PCR all amplicons were purified using the Min-Elute System (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and quantified with the Qubit 2.0 high sensitivity ds DNA assay (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States). The purified amplicons were then pooled in an equimolar concentration to create the library following Illumina protocols. The sample library was combined with a 10% Phi-X control library to create diversity and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using a V2 500-cycle kit (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, United States). Sequence Analysis All 16S and ITS FASTQ sequences were obtained using the Illumina MiSeq Control Software and default settings for demultiplexing all samples. Sequence analyses for 16S sequences were completed using RDP GreenGenes (DeSantis et al., 2006) to obtain the taxonomic reference. ITS FASTQ results were analyzed with the UNITE database (Kõljalg et al., 2013) to analyze the reference sequences and for taxonomic assignment. The Shannon Index was calculated for alpha diversity for each sample with MiSeq control Software (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA, United States) while the Bray–Curtis (Anderson, 2001) statistics methods calculated beta diversity between samples. Total Anthocyanins Approximately 100 mg of each dry sample powder was placed in an ASE350 cell of the Dionex Automated Solvent Extraction System (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, United States) and extracted with a solvent mixture of methanol:water:acetic acid (MWA) 85:14.5:0.5 (V/V/V) (methanol and acetic acid; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). Parameters for the ASE 350 were: 100°C with 5 min static time; 70% flush; 90 s purge; 1 cycle; and 1500 psi. Extracts were analyzed immediately after extraction for total anthocyanin content by reading their absorbance at 530 and 650 nm (Beckman DU 700). A standard curve was created using Cyandin-3-Glycoside (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). ORAC and Total Phenolic Content A separate extract was prepared for the determination, firstly, of the antioxidant capacity using the hydrophilic Oxygen Radical Adsorption Capacity (ORAC-FL) assay and secondly, the total phenolics in the sample. Twenty five milligrams (25 mg) of the freeze dried sample was placed in an ASE 350 cell and extracted with acetone:water:acetic acid (AWA) at the ratio of 70%:29.5%:0.5%. Parameters for the ASE 350 were: 80°C with 5 min static time; 60% flush; 60 s purge; 1 cycle; and 1500 psi. Aliquots of 0.2 ml were subsequently reacted with Folin-Ciocalteu phenol reagent (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) for the determination of total phenolics by the modified Folin-Ciocalteu assay (Prior et al., 2005). A series of known concentrations of gallic acid (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was prepared and reacted with the same reagent to create a calibration curve that was in turn used to determine the concentration in the sample extracts. Consequently, the total phenolics were expressed as gallic acid (GA) equivalents. A diluted (1/50) AWA extract was subjected to the ORAC-FL assay as described by Wu et al. (2004) and Prior et al. (2005). Specifically, dilutions of the AWA extracted samples were prepared in a 75 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0). Aliquots of 20 μL of the diluted sample were placed (in triplicate) in a 96 well transparent flat bottom microplate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), along with appropriately diluted Trolox [(±)-6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane- 2-carboxylic acid; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, United States] standards (in triplicate), under subdued light. A “forward-then-reverse” pattern was used to place samples in the microplates, and edge wells were not used for standards or samples due to possible plate effects. Samples were analyzed on a BioTek Synergy Hybrid plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, United States) which automatically added 200 μL of diluted fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) into each well, followed by 20 μL of the peroxyl radical generator (AAPH [2′2′azobis (2-amidinopropane)] Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). The assay was monitored every few minutes for 2 h, at 37°C. The ORAC-FL value was calculated from the area under the decay curve, and was reported as μmol Trolox equivalents (TE)/g dry weight. Elemental Analysis Dried and ground plant material (0.2–0.5 g) was digested in an open vessel system using a graphite-heating block (Mod Block, PN 4370-010007, CPI International). The plant material was digested at 95°C using a modification of the Environmental Protection Agency, (EPA) Method 3050B, as described below. A 5 ml aliquot of 70% nitric acid (70% Trace Metal Grade, Fisher Scientific, Suwanee, GA, United States) was added to the samples and then boiled for approximately 2 h (or until sample was completely clear). After cooling 2.5 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide (Fisher Scientific, Suwannee, GA, United States) was applied. When the peroxide reaction ceased, samples were reheated for an additional 50 m in covered vials. Samples were cooled overnight, diluted to 50 ml with ultra-pure DI water and then passed through a 25 mm 0.45 μm syringe filter (GE Whatman, Pittsburgh, PA, United States). Samples were analyzed via Inductively Coupled Optical Emission Spectrometry. (iCAP 7000 Series, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) A multi-element standard (Environmental Express) was diluted to the same acid concentration as the samples and quantification was done by external calibration. Statistical Analysis Data from microbiological counts (log transformed) and chemistry values were compared using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, United States). Alpha diversity was determined using the Shannon Diversity Index and was calculated by Illumina RDP Control Software (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Beta diversity of community sequencing was determined with Bray–Curtis dissimilarity (Anderson, 2001) using a one-way ANOVA (QIIME 2.0) (Bolyen et al., 2018). A t-test (Microsoft Excel) was done to compare differences in the percent phyla identified.",
    "results": "Results Microbial Counts on Leaves and Roots VEG-01A was the first time the Veggie facility had been used for plant growth on ISS (Massa et al., 2017a, b) so presumably it would have been the least likely of the three plantings described in this study to harbor microbial contamination. Aerobic plate counts for the leaves harvested from VEG-01B flight plants were significantly higher than the counts from both harvests of VEG-03A flight and the ground controls (P < 0.05) (Figure 2). With the exception of VEG-01B, the flight and ground control aerobic plate counts on leaves were not significantly different. The bacterial counts on ground control samples from VEG-01B were significantly lower than the flight leaves by orders of magnitude (P < 0.0001) (Figure 2). Previous studies (Hummerick et al., 2010, 2012) have shown an increase in microbial counts with a repeated harvest or “cut and come again” protocol as was done in VEG-03A. An increase between the 2nd and 4th harvests was not seen in bacterial counts on the leaves, however, fungal counts in the flight leaves were significantly higher in the 4th harvest when compared to the 2nd harvest (P = 0.0002) (Figure 3). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Mean bacterial (A) and fungal (B) counts on Outredgeous leaves from three Veggie experiments.

Horizontal lines indicate significance between flight samples. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01. Significant differences were determined using an ANOVA with Tukey’s post test to compare groups.The bacterial counts on lettuce leaves grown on ISS in VEG-01A, B and both harvests from VEG-03A were relatively low on average, 3.53, 4.86, 2.89, and 2.14 log10 CFU/g respectively (Figure 2), when compared to farm or market produce counts of similar type (Valentin-Bon and Jacobson, 2008; Rastogi et al., 2012; Jackson et al., 2013; Holvoet et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015; Hagenmair and Baker, 2016; Oyinlola et al., 2017; Fröhling et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Fungal counts on Veggie grown lettuce ranging from 2.3 to 4.3 log10 CFU/g were within the range of yeast and mold counts on lettuce reported in the literature (Figure 3) (Oliveira et al., 2010). Bacterial counts from the roots in the VEG-03A grow out were significantly lower than the other two grow outs and lower than the corresponding ground control (Figure 3) although these counts were in a range of 106-108 per gram which is typical of lettuce root tissue (Riser et al., 1984; Adesina et al., 2009). Screening for potential food borne pathogens, E. coli, Salmonella sp., and S. aureus on the leaf tissue yielded negative results. These screening results were corroborated by NGS data. Cultivated Bacterial and Fungal Isolate Identification Cultivation of individual bacterial colony phenotypes on TSA from VEG-01 and VEG-03 samples yielded 14 genera identified from the leaf samples (Table 2) and 19 from the root samples (Table 3). It is important to note that culture based isolation utilized in this study is limited to the selection of the mostly dominant colony phenotypes that grew under aerobic conditions on one type of general growth media. A majority of the bacterial taxa isolated from the Veggie grown leaves are known endophytic and/or epiphytic phyllosphere commensals or symbionts including Arthrobacter (Scheublin and Leveau, 2013), Methylobacterium (Peredo and Simmons, 2018), Sphingomonas (Kim et al., 1998), Pantoea (Whipps et al., 2008), Burkholderia (Eberl and Vandamme, 2016), and Curtobacterium (Chase et al., 2016). Paenibacillus is ubiquitous in soil and is associated with plants predominately as a rhizosphere bacterium exhibiting plant growth promoting characteristics (Grady et al., 2016). A few of the leaf isolates are known to be transients on the surface of the leaf and are not typically part of the normal phyllosphere microbial community including Bacillus and Staphylococcus (Maduell et al., 2008; Dees et al., 2015). Human associated bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus were found on the leaves of both flight and ground samples from VEG-03A. These are not natural inhabitants of the plant phyllosphere, however certain strains can be pathogenic to humans and cause food borne illness under optimal growth conditions (Kadariya et al., 2014).

A ± indicates the presence or absence of each genus in flight or ground samples.The bacterial genera isolated from the roots (Table 3) are predominately associated with soil and plant phyllosphere and rhizosphere. Ten of the 19 root isolates were also recovered from the leaf samples excluding the four genera Macrococcus, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Sphingomonas. Nine genera of fungi were isolated and identified from leaf tissue (Table 4), while six were recovered from root (Table 5). All the fungal genera present in the roots were also present on the leaves with the exception of Alternaria. The fungi Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Alternaria are ubiquitous, saprophytic fungi often isolated from soil and the environment including ISS surface and air samples (Royer et al., 2004; Venkateswaran et al., 2017). Verma et al. (2011) found many of these genera of filamentous fungi as endophytes in the Indian Lily plant root. Among the fungi, the basidiomycete, Rhodotorula was the most common and in fact was isolated from every Veggie sample with the exception of the VEG-03 leaf tissue. TABLE 4.

Community Sequencing Sampling and sequencing of the flight and ground Veggie grown plants were completed on a minimum of two root pillows and up to five leaf samples per grow out. Sequencing profiles for each of the Veggie plantings were used to calculate and investigate the Shannon Species Diversity Index (Alpha Diversity) (Table 6) and establish relative diversity within the bacterial communities in leaf and root and ground and flight samples. Leaf diversity was lower than root in each of the three lettuce crops and there was no significant difference between flight and ground samples (Table 6). Although diversity was similar in all roots or leaves, there appeared to be variation in the dominant genera. TABLE 6.

Plus/minus values are standard deviation determined from three separate sample replicates within each experiment.Alpha diversity in leaf tissue of the three Veggie experiments showed a significant difference between ground and flight leaf samples of VEG-03A only (P = 0.01). VEG-01A and B flight samples were not significantly different from the respective ground samples. There was also no significant difference in Beta diversity between VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A experiments. Bray Curtis dissimilarity calculations comparing all three experiments were not significantly different between any leaf or root samples of the three tests (P > 0.05). A majority of the bacterial community sequencing at the phyla level were assigned to phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Comparison at the phyla taxonomic level indicated no significant difference between ground and flight root communities nor in the leaf communities. The dominant phyla for all plants, both ground and flight, was Proteobacteria. VEG-03A flight roots had the lowest percent of the Proteobacteria reads at 59% while the corresponding flight leaf sample was 76% of the total bacterial communities. All other plants from VEG-01A and B ranged from 80 to 96% Proteobacterial reads. However, this disparity was not significantly different. A closer look at the genera contained in the Veggie leaf and root samples showed that Burkholderia, Ralstonia, and Janthinobacterium dominated the Proteobacteria phyla (Figure 4). Other Proteobacteria present in the samples were Azospirillum, and Herbaspirillum, which were detected in higher abundance in VEG-03A as well as Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium, all of which may play a role in nitrogen fixation (Okubo et al., 2012). The dominant genera representing the Chloroflexi was the gram positive, thermophilic, Thermogemmatispora, a soil microbe (Komaki et al., 2016). These microbes were also transported to the leaf but were detected in much lower abundances (percentage), particularly in the flight and ground samples in VEG-03A. Thermogemmatispora was also detected in higher percentages than other microbes but was less than in VEG-03A. The dominant microbe representing the Bacteroidetes, which took second to the Proteobacteria in numerous samples was Chitinophaga. Chitinophaga was higher in abundance of reads in flight sample roots with only VEG-01B showing an elevated abundance in the ground samples (Figure 4). FIGURE 4.

Bacteria are the top genera obtained from next generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq.Fungal communities from VEG-01A and VEG-01B were surveyed and it was determined that the Ascomycota phyla dominated both flight and ground communities as well as leaf and root communities (92–99%). Few Basidiomycota were detectable. VEG-01A flight roots presented the highest representation at 7% with VEG-01B flight root community containing 6%. All other communities contained 2% or less of total fungi detected (Figure 5). FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Fungal community for lettuce leaf (A) and root (B) tissue for VEG-01A and VEG-01B experiments. Flight experiments were grown on the ISS while ground controls were grown in Environmental Growth Chambers at Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States. Fungi are the top genera obtained from next generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq.Fungal diversity in the root samples for both flight and ground was significantly higher than leaf – an expected outcome (P < 0.05). Among the dominating genera in flight and ground leaf samples was Microidium, an obligate biotroph (Braun and Cook, 2012; Meeboon and Takamatsu, 2017). Leaf samples also housed Alternaria, Fusarium (VEG-01B only), and Malassezia, a yeast like fungi. Root samples from all three growth tests had increased levels of Alternaria, Phaeoacremonium, and Rhodosporidiobolus (Figure 5). Alternaria was found in all samples with the exception of VEG-01A leaf tissue while Phaeoacremonium was present in increased abundance in VEG-01A root and in reduced numbers in VEG-01A leaf tissue (Figure 5). Comparison of culturable and non-culturable microbes in all samples provided corroborating evidence in that all culturable microbes were identified in the sequencing data. However, sequencing data revealed many additional genera present, increasing the species diversity. Elemental Analysis Leaf tissue from flight and ground experiments were analyzed for changes in elemental composition (Table 7). There was no significant differences between ground and flight samples within each experiment, however when comparing among all three experiments, Fe and K content were significantly lower in VEG-03A samples compared to VEG-01A and VEG-01B (Fe, P ≤ 0.001; K, P ≤ 0.0001). On the other hand, Na content was found to be significantly higher in VEG-01B compared to VEG-01A or VEG-03A (P ≤ 0.0001). Phosphate (P) measured among all three experiments showed that VEG-01B had higher P contents than VEG-01A and VEG-03A (P ≤ 0.05). Similarly, sulfate measured as S and Zn contents were statistically higher in VEG-01B compared to either VEG-01A or VEG-03A (S, P ≤ 0.05; Zn, P ≤ 0.0001). No significant differences were observed in either Ca, Mg, or Mn content. TABLE 7. Elemental content of lettuce leaf tissue from VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A ground and flight samples.

Comparing total phenolics, VEG-03A with 15.0 (ground) and 19.6 (flight) mg/g of dry weight (gallic acid equivalents) had the statistically lowest amounts when compared to either VEG-01A or VEG-01B (P ≤ 0.001). Anthocyanins measured as cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents showed no difference among all three experiments compared.

    "discussion": "Discussion Differences in culturable bacterial and fungal density on the leaves in each of the Veggie plantings can not necessarily be traced to a particular source or environmental condition. However, it is reasonable to conclude that environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, water levels provided, the microbiota in the air on ISS, and possible human interaction at the time of growth and harvest may contribute to the microbial community and density on the surface of the leaves. Terrestrially, airborne bacteria and fungal spores can land on the surface of leaves and become a part of the epiphytic microbial community albeit transient and dynamic depending on selective pressures (Lindow and Brandl, 2003; Vokou et al., 2012; Maignien et al., 2014). Varying conditions such as humidity, leaf surface moisture and temperature can also effect the colonization and growth of bacteria and fungi on leaf surfaces. There is a positive correlation between fungal sporulation and the duration of leaf surface moisture (Talley et al., 2002; Li et al., 2014). Poor air circulation can cause persistent droplets of moisture on the surface of a leaf due to transpiration producing a micro environment favorable for microbial proliferation. In the case of the three Veggie plantings on the ISS, environmental data collected by HOBO data recorders (Supplementary Table S1) showed that temperature and humidity were slightly higher inside the Veggie chamber during the first 22 days of VEG-03A growth than the other two Veggie tests. Additionally, germinating seedlings in the VEG-03A test had excess moisture in the early period of growth, likely due to a fan malfunction, when compared to the VEG-01A and VEG-01B plants. It was during this experiment that our team identified a consistent anomaly with the Veggie hardware – specifically that when power is cycled to the hardware, upon restarting the fan will read “low” but it will actually be off. This problem also led to issues of excess moisture in an earlier Zinnia test but a repetition of this with lettuce confirmed the anomaly. In contrast, VEG-01A and VEG-01B tests had no fan issues, but instead the plants had some periods of low water early on (see Massa et al., 2017a). Given that Veggie is a manually watered system and that fluid behavior in microgravity differs considerably from that on Earth, these early Veggie experiments involved considerable variation in fluid addition as both the ground teams and the astronauts struggled to effectively water the crops. Logged data from VEG-03A were not collected for the duration of the 64 days experiment so it is speculative to conclude any correlation between microbial counts and Veggie chamber conditions. Key to this work is determining the microbiological food safety of Veggie grown crops. Bacterial and fungal counts on fresh plant material are not necessarily an indication of the food quality and microbiological safety of the item and vary depending on the type of plant (Leff and Fierer, 2013; Qadri et al., 2015). Studies show that leafy greens grown in the field or greenhouse have a range of approximately 4–8 log10 CFU bacterial counts per gram of sample while yeast and mold counts on lettuce are reported in the range of 2–5 log10 (Valentin-Bon and Jacobson, 2008; Rastogi et al., 2012; Jackson et al., 2013; Holvoet et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015; Hagenmair and Baker, 2016; Oyinlola et al., 2017; Fröhling et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). The microbial counts on lettuce leaves grown on ISS in VEG-01A, B and both harvests from VEG-03A were relatively low on average when compared to farm or market produce counts of similar type. In addition, none of the target human pathogens were detected in culture based testing and 16S community sequencing. These results demonstrate that from a microbiological perspective the Outredgeous variety of lettuce grown in Veggie was safe for human consumption. Microbiological data collected from lettuce and reported in the literature provides evidence that different parts of the plant, i.e., leaves and roots support distinct microbial communities (Ibekwe and Grieve, 2004; Toju et al., 2019). While our culture based isolation of bacteria recovered a few species unique to leaves many of the isolates present on the phyllosphere were also present in the roots. Previous work on the relationship of the phyllosphere bacterial community and airborne bacteria by Vokou et al. (2012) demonstrated that colonization of the phyllosphere is not always related to the aerial microbial community within the plants proximity and may include commensal and symbiotic taxa as well as environmentally indigenous transients. Staphylococcus has been isolated on the ISS on both surfaces and in the air (Venkateswaran et al., 2014, 2017) so it is not unlikely that plants in Veggie chambers would be exposed to these types of bacteria. Microbiological surveys done on a variety of surfaces and materials on the ISS reported many of the same bacteria and fungi that we isolated from plant material grown in Veggie. We compared bacterial and fungal isolates from this study of Veggie grown plants with isolates described in a study by Venkateswaran et al. (2017) which characterized the microbiology of ISS surfaces. More than 50% of the genera of bacteria and 100% of the fungi isolated and identified on ISS surfaces were also isolated from Veggie samples. NASA reported monitoring results of space station samples including air surfaces and water from 1998 to 2012 using cultivation methods (Castro et al., 2004; Yamaguchi et al., 2014). In these studies, the two most commonly isolated genera from water samples collected between 2009 and 2012 were Burkholderia sp. and Ralstonia sp. These are persistent and common in station potable water as well as terrestrial water sources and have been isolated and identified from Space Shuttle potable water (Koenig and Pierson, 1997; Ryan et al., 2007) so it is not unexpected that these were also isolated in the roots and leaves of both flight and ground control plants. Plants, regardless of growth conditions, harbor an indigenous population that may affect plant health and, if utilized as a food source, human health. One of the important findings in this study is the similarity and densities in the dominant leaf and root microbial community members as those reported in the literature grown under very different conditions (Dees et al., 2015). Culturable microbes include approximately 10% of the community microbial participants. Research on core rhizosphere and phyllosphere associated bacterial microbiota (symbiotic and pathogenic) have been described using culture-independent sequencing methods (Panstruga and Kuhn, 2019). Next generation sequencing provides an alternative method to identify non-culturable microorganisms. It is important to identify these organisms as it may provide insight into the safety and health quality of the plants/crops being harvested and consumed. Each of the bacterial and fungal isolates identified in this study were confirmed with sequencing results, however, many additional genera were identified. Research studies indicate Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria phyla dominate communities, though differences may occur between host plant species at lower taxonomic levels (Panstruga and Kuhn, 2019). Sequencing data from the three Veggie experiments followed these trends. Lettuce leaf tissue in all three Veggie experiments was dominated with Thermogemmatispora, a gram positive, sporulating, soil organism that has been known to produce secondary metabolites provided to plants as a secondary resource (Komaki et al., 2016). Thermogemmatispora has been found in lettuce seeds in high abundance but was reduced in root and leaf tissues (unpublished data, Khodadad et al). Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium are also commonly found in soils as they may participate in nitrogen fixation (Okubo et al., 2012). Bradyrhizobium has also been noted in higher abundance in low nutrient soils (Okubo et al., 2012). Both microbes were present in higher abundance in flight root samples and were low or undetectable in leaf tissue with the highest abundance in VEG-03A roots. VEG-03A was grown for longer periods of time and may have depleted the nutrient levels in the substrate. In addition, microbes commonly associated with water were also detected in both leaf and root tissue. These microbes mentioned previously include Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Cupriavidus, and Pseudomonas were identified in all leaf and root samples of all three Veggie experiments. These have been identified as present on ISS as well as in the ISS water system (Castro et al., 2004; Checinska et al., 2015; Venkateswaran et al., 2017). It is important to note that several of the microbes identified may be potential endosymbionts with plants or fungi and be present as epiphytic or endophytic organisms. One example is Chitinophaga, found in all flight and ground root samples. Though it is unknown what the function of this bacteria may have been within these Veggie communities, it has been found to interact with fungal species present in plants by enhancing nutrient uptake and growth, altering plant water interactions or deterring potential pathogens (Shaffer et al., 2017). These interactions have the capability of shaping plant health and productivity by accessing and making additional carbon sources available (Kivlin et al., 2011; Shaffer et al., 2017). To determine their role and benefit to plants or fungi would require additional flight and ground studies. As fungi were present in each flight and ground sample community, it is important to note those in abundance and their persistence over time. Fungi have been detected on the ISS in various locations (Venkateswaran et al., 2014, 2017). Leaf and root systems of VEG-01A and B were surveyed for the presence of fungi and compared. Alternaria, Microidium, and Phaeoacremonium were the top three fungal genera identified with sequencing. Alternaria, an Ascomycota, has been described as a saprophyte that may decompose organic matter, and increase in communities with high humidity (Patriarca, 2016). They may also associate with other fungal genera such as Fusarium or Stachybotrys. Though neither of these fungal genera were identified in VEG-01A, both were first detected in VEG-01B samples with higher incidence in ground samples therefore, they may have been introduced as a contaminant. Phaeoacremonium is a plant associated endophyte previously associated with lettuce and woody plants (Mostert et al., 2005) while Microidium may be an opportunistic plant pathogen especially in high humidity environments (Braun and Cook, 2012; Meeboon and Takamatsu, 2017). Plants require macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (Fe, B, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mo) for their growth and development (Epstein, 1972). These elements are essential and play critical roles in multiple plant processes. Comparing all three experiments, VEG-01B had higher elemental contents for Na, P, S, and Zn, whereas VEG-03A had the lowest amounts for Fe and K. Considering the chronological order of the experiments onboard the ISS, VEG-01B was grown a year later than VEG-01A, which raises the possibility of a change in the ISS water, but that may not be the only variable as plants grown in microgravity experience stresses from environmental conditions, so it would be impractical to draw any conclusions from these differences. VEG-03A, which was grown 1.5 years after the VEG-01B, was the sequential harvest experiment. As described in section “Materials and Methods,” there were four repeated harvests (38, 45, 59, and 64 days after initiation) of this experiment and only two (day 45 and day 64) were returned to earth. Romaine lettuce in field settings can take 75 days to fully mature, however, controlled environment growth is generally faster. By the final harvest photos indicated that some of the plants seemed to be transitioning to a reproductive growth phase, so it is possible that stresses from space flight may have pushed the plants to initiate senescence and that could provide a possible explanation for slightly lower elemental levels of some elements in VEG-03A samples (Maillard et al., 2015). Similarly, differences in the levels of total phenolics among VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A samples could be attributed to the environmental conditions. There have been known challenges associated with irrigation of plants in the Veggie hardware and VEG-01 showed evidence of insufficient and excess (in case of zinnia, VEG-01C) water in the root zone (Massa et al., 2017a). Studies have shown that either insufficient watering (drought-like, Sarker and Oba, 2018) or over-watering leading to hypoxia (Rajapakse et al., 2009) can induce production of phenolic compounds and free-radical scavenging activities. Again, there are not enough data to make any conclusions about the effects of the sequential harvesting method on plant ionome or phenolic content and more robust experiments are needed. Numerous Veggie tests have been conducted on the ISS, the plant growth evaluated, and in some cases the leaves consumed. Three plantings of red romaine lettuce were considered here (VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A). Through culturable and non-culturable methods of microbial analysis, the Veggie tests demonstrated diverse microbial communities with no potential human pathogens detected and therefore could provide a safe supplement to the astronauts’ diet. Chemical analysis provided evidence of significant changes in elemental and antioxidant content which may be an important factor to consider for nutritional value in future, long duration, exploration missions.",

Copyright notice ID: 7067979 PMID: 32210992 Abstract The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS. Keywords: lettuce, microgravity, ISS, phyllosphere, rhizosphere, space, microbesIntroduction Crop production in space may be a necessary and desirable component of future exploration systems (MacElroy et al., 1992; Kliss et al., 2000). Fresh produce can be grown in situ to supplement a stored, packaged diet, and crops may provide beneficial nutrients as well as dietary variety. Veggie is a small plant growth chamber designed and built by Orbital Technologies Corporation (Now Sierra Nevada Corp., Madison, WI, United States) to grow vegetable crops in space (Morrow et al., 2005; Morrow and Remiker, 2009). The first Veggie plant growth chamber was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in April, 2014 along with eighteen plant (rooting) pillows for the VEG-01 experiment. Veggie is a simple plant growth facility that uses LED lights and fans to circulate ISS air through the plant growth volume. A transparent, extensible bellows attached to the light unit via magnets contains the growing plants and any debris, and directs air flow from the bottom of the canopy to the top of the growth volume (Figure 1). Screens remove large particles from the cabin air before it passes through the plant growth chamber, however, no level of filtration is present, so plants growing in Veggie are exposed to any microbial or chemical constituents present in the ISS environment. More details about the Veggie facility can be found in Massa et al. (2016). For the VEG-01 and VEG-03 demonstration tests, plants were grown from seeds in plant pillows. Plant pillows are small growing bags that interact with a root mat water reservoir on the Veggie baseplate. Pillows contain a calcined clay substrate mixed with controlled release fertilizer and wicks for seed attachment. Surface sanitized seeds are glued into these plant pillow wicks, and pillows are packaged for flight under sterile air. Further details of seed and pillow preparation are provided by Massa et al. (2017b). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Veggie payload containing a crop of mature red romaine lettuce in Veggie pillows aboard the ISS with the light panel off (left) and red light panel on (right). Bellows are in the up position.A major focus of our research in the past several years has been to identify crop candidates with high potential for dietary supplementation, given the constraints associated with the current space diet. Ongoing testing has indicated that some essential human nutrients are either deficient in the processed and pre-packaged space foods (e.g., potassium, Vitamin K) or may degrade to inadequate levels over the times required for long duration missions (e.g., Vitamin B1, Vitamin C) (Cooper, 2013). Several of these nutrients may be supplemented through fresh salad crops and will provide antioxidants and phytochemicals in a natural, whole-food form. Previous studies with salad crops have focused on combinations of environmental conditions (e.g., light, temperature, CO2 concentration) needed to optimize plant growth for space settings (Richards et al., 2004, 2006). While the macro nutritional value of crops was often evaluated in productivity studies (calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates), micro nutritional data are limited (McKeehen et al., 1996; Wheeler et al., 1996, 1997). In order to utilize “pick-and-eat” produce such as the lettuce crops grown in VEG-01 and 03 as a supplemental food for space, nutritional assessment is essential. In this study we compare the nutritional quality of red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa, cv. Outredgeous) grown on ISS to ground controls grown under the same ISS environmental conditions including relative humidity, CO2 concentration and temperature. Within a Veggie chamber, conditions such as humidity and temperature can vary from ISS conditions outside the chamber, for example, the temperature and humidity inside the Veggie tend to be slightly elevated compared to the open cabin air. These differences may have an impact on the elemental, nutritional and microbiological components of the plant. Increased temperatures have been shown to decrease macronutrient content in red leaf lettuce while increasing flavonoids and phenolics (Sublett et al., 2018). Studies have shown that increased humidity initiates a positive response in biomass yield in many agricultural crops while concomitantly decreasing transpiration rate altering the uptake of water and some nutrients (Tibbitts, 1979; Gislerød and Mortensen, 1990). Microbiological testing is an integral part of any food safety program to verify quality, production and proper handling processes but few studies exist for space grown plants (Hummerick et al., 2010). We conducted microbiological testing of Veggie-grown produce to understand potential risks to astronauts as consumers. Good agricultural practices and procedures are in place to minimize microbial contamination of crops grown in Veggie, and microbial testing is one tool to verify the effectiveness of these processes (Hummerick et al., 2011). Plant-growth conditions, the surrounding environment, mineral nutrition, and plant species can all influence the microbial populations living on plant surfaces (Lindow and Brandl, 2003). A variety of microorganisms can be found on fresh produce, most as part of the normal flora of the plant with no adverse effect on humans if consumed (Heaton and Jones, 2008; Leff and Fierer, 2013; Oyinlola et al., 2017). Microbiological analysis can also provide insight on the microbial ecology (population density and types of bacteria and fungi) of Veggie-grown plants. The likelihood of contamination and growth of potential human pathogens on plants grown in Veggie is low since sterilization/sanitization of seeds, plant growth medium, irrigation water, and hardware can be controlled. However, if a contamination event were to occur, the risks to the crew of exposure to food borne pathogens could be increased considering the association of immune dysregulation to spaceflight (Borchers et al., 2002). Heterotrophic bacterial counts and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae that serve as an indicator of contamination of processed foods, irrigation water, and food processing surfaces are frequently present in raw foods like fresh produce making those tests irrelevant as risk indicators for fruits and vegetables (Heaton and Jones, 2008; Leff and Fierer, 2013). The microbial load on crops intended for consumption by astronauts presumably should fall within an acceptable range of microbiological standards set for food. Currently, however, there are no standards in place for microbial levels in fresh produce grown in space. The closest related NASA standards are for non-thermostabilized food items including any of the freeze dried foods consumed in orbit, e.g., shrimp cocktail, chocolate candy, granola bars. For example, the current limit for aerobic bacteria on a non-thermostabilized food item is <2 × 104 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram on one sample or <1 × 104 on two out of five samples (Perchonok et al., 2012) however, these standards apply to prepackaged food sent from Earth. For fresh produce grown on ISS, the microbiological acceptability is assessed on a case-by-case basis relying on microbiological analysis of crops grown in ground studies analogous to Veggie grown crops. Microbiological analysis has been performed previously on edible plants grown in the Russian Lada chamber on ISS (Hummerick et al., 2010, 2011). Mizuna, barley and radish from Lada were stored at −80°C after harvest until analysis was performed at Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States. A range of microbial densities as indicated by aerobic bacterial and fungal plate counts was found depending on plant type and location. The four samples of mizuna, the only leafy green tested, were grown in different Lada root modules at different times and counts ranged from 3.1 × 103 – 8.7 × 105. When compared to field grown or market produce of similar types these numbers are well within the expected range of microbial densities or even lower (Holvoet et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015; Fröhling et al., 2018; Hummerick et al., unpublished data). However, not all microorganisms can be cultured in the laboratory and alternate methods of community characterization are needed (Byrd et al., 1991; Schaule et al., 1993; Kalmbach et al., 1997). Genomic DNA analysis using whole genome or amplicon sequencing provides the capability of identifying 98–99% of the microbes present in a complex, heterogeneous microbial community. With the current advances in technology, the Illumina MiSeq provided a platform for capturing the community structure of the leaf and root material returned from the ISS and for the ground control samples. Identifying the community makeup is the first step in understanding the complex structure and interactions between mutualistic or symbiotic partners in plant growth systems. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ISS and Veggie environmental conditions on the microbiological and nutritional quality of Veggie grown lettuce intended for crew consumption.Materials and Methods Plant Growth and Harvest The Veggie production system on ISS is a small plant growth chamber designed and built by ORBITEC (Madison, WI, United States) to grow crops in space (Morrow et al., 2005; Morrow and Remiker, 2009). The Veggie production system, equipped with LED lighting and a passive watering system, launched to the ISS in 2014 aboard Space X’s third Commercial Resupply (CRS-3) mission (Figure 1). Red romaine lettuce Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’ was grown in Veggie rooting pillows as described by Massa et al. (2017a). Briefly, plants were grown in Veggie pillows containing solid, porous, arcillite (calcined clay) substrate in two different blends, either 100% sized to 600 μ–1 mm or a 1:1 ratio of that size to 1–2 mm (Turface Proleague, Profile Products, LLC) and controlled release fertilizer (Nutricote 18-6-8, type 180, Florikan, Sarasota, FL, United States). Procedures for detailed substrate and pillow preparation are outlined in Massa et al. (2017b). Two surface sanitized seeds were attached with guar in each plant pillow between paired germination wicks. All plant rooting pillows with attached seeds were kept dry in heat sealed, gas-impermeable Tedlar bags until test initiation on the ISS. Seeds for three separate, independent plantings (biological replicates) were germinated and grown for 33–56 days on ISS and ground controls were run in controlled environment chambers under ISS environmental conditions with a 24 h delay for VEG-01A and B and a 72 h delay for VEG-03A. Each experiment began with six rooting pillows. Germinated seeds were thinned to one plant per pillow at day 7. Each independent planting was grown at different times aboard ISS with parallel ground experiments for comparison (Table 1). TABLE 1. Initiation and harvest schedule of red romaine lettuce crop in Veggie aboard ISS. Experiment Initiation date Harvest date VEG-01A 5/8/2014 6/10/2014 (Day 33) VEG-OIB 7/8/2015 8/10/2015 (Day 33) VEG-03A 10/25/2016 2nd 12/09/2016 4th 12/28/2016 Open in a new tab Ground controls were harvested 1 day later for VEG-01 and 3 days later for VEG-03.VEG-01A was grown from May 8 to June 10, 2014; VEG-01B was grown from July 8 to August 10, 2015, and VEG-03A was grown from October 25 to December 28, 2016. VEG-01A and B were harvested after 33 days of growth using sanitized scissors to remove the leaves (Table 1). VEG-03A leaves were harvested sequentially starting at 33 days followed by 3 weekly harvests. Harvested leaves from each plant were wrapped in foil and placed into a −80°C freezer. The first, third, and half of the fourth harvests were consumed by the crew. Only the 2nd harvest and the remaining leaves (approximately half of the total leaves) of the final harvest from VEG-03A were stored for sample return. After completion of the final harvest for all three plantings, two rooting pillows from each independent experiment were removed from Veggie hardware and placed into bags and frozen at −80°C. Ground control samples were processed and stored the same as flight samples. The Veggie baseplate was positioned 30.5–31.75 cm below the LED light array to provide approximately 200 μmol⋅m2⋅s–1of photosynthetically active radiation at the surface of the pillows in the center of the Veggie unit at a ratio of 12 red (630 nm): 3 Blue (455 nm): 1 green (530 nm). A photoperiod was set to 16 h light/8 h dark. Environmental conditions from the three experiments are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Both the VEG-01A and part of the VEG-03A experiment on ISS had data collected inside the Veggie chamber using a temperature and relative humidity data logger.Sample Processing After return to Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States samples from all three experiments were maintained in a −80°C freezer until analysis. Plant samples were removed from the freezer and processed immediately while pillows were thawed at 4°C overnight. Leaf biomass was divided for microbiological and chemical analysis. The samples intended for chemical analysis were subsequently frozen at −80°C, freeze dried, then ground up using an IKA Tekmar A10 Analytical Grinding Mill. Roots were removed from each pillow and divided for microbiological and molecular analysis.Microbiological Analysis Leaf and pillow root samples were placed into sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with glass beads, weighed then shaken vigorously for 2 min. Sample extracts were diluted into PBS and appropriate dilutions were plated in duplicate onto trypticase soy agar (TSA) and inhibitory mold agar (IMA). Plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h for TSA and 72–120 h for IMA before enumeration of colonies. Individual colony phenotypes were selected for each sample and streaked for isolation. Isolated bacterial colonies were identified using the Micro Id System (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) or MicroSEQ 16S rDNA sequencing kit for bacteria (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Fungal colonies were identified using the MicroSEQ D2 LSU rDNA kit for fungi (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Sequencing was completed on the ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Bacterial and fungal DNA sequences were identified using MicroSEQ ID Software V2.0 (Bacterial Library, 2009; Fungal Library, 2011, Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, United States) and/or  Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). For microbial food safety screening, sample extracts were plated onto E. coli/coliform and Staph Express Petrifilm (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Petrifilms were incubated at 35°C for 24 h and colonies positive for E. coli and S. aureus were enumerated. Coliform colonies, if present, were re-isolated and further identified using Biolog GEN III plates. Screening for Salmonella was done by inoculating buffered peptone water (BPW) with 1 ml of sample extract followed by incubation at 35°C for 24 h. For selective enrichment, 1 ml of the incubated BPW was transferred into 5 ml of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) broth or Tetrathionate broth (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and incubated for 24 h at 35°C. Broths were then streaked onto selective media for Salmonella and incubated at 35°C for 24–48 h. These methods were adapted from the FDA bacteriological analytical manual (FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018).Microbial DNA Isolation, 16S and ITS PCR, and Sequencing DNA was isolated from sample material processed for microbiological analysis described above. Each sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm to pellet microbial cells, suspended in RNAlater and stored at −80°C until processing for DNA isolation was completed. DNA was extracted from plant leaf and root material of the Veggie pillows using the Microbial Cell DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Inc, Carlsbad, CA, United States) then quantified using the Qubit 2.0 double stranded DNA assay (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States). The variable 4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) was selected as a phylogenetic marker to identify microorganisms taxonomically to the species level. A dual indexing system for multiplexing was adapted for these communities and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was optimized for reagent concentrations and volume. Each community was labeled with two barcoded primers for identification at completion of sequencing. Amplicons were created in triplicate using 1 ng of template DNA, and final reagent concentrations of 1X buffer, 200 μM dNTP’s, 25 mM MgCl2, and 300 nM each barcoded 16S rRNA gene primer for bacterial identification or barcoded ITS primers for fungal identification (Bokulich and Mills, 2013; Kozich et al., 2013). The PCR cycling conditions were 95°C for 5 min to denature the Taq polymerase enzyme, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 58°C for annealing and 72°C for 2 min for extension. A final 10 min extension of 72°C completed the PCR run on a Bio-Rad C-1000 thermocycler. After PCR all amplicons were purified using the Min-Elute System (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and quantified with the Qubit 2.0 high sensitivity ds DNA assay (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States). The purified amplicons were then pooled in an equimolar concentration to create the library following Illumina protocols. The sample library was combined with a 10% Phi-X control library to create diversity and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using a V2 500-cycle kit (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, United States).Sequence Analysis All 16S and ITS FASTQ sequences were obtained using the Illumina MiSeq Control Software and default settings for demultiplexing all samples. Sequence analyses for 16S sequences were completed using RDP GreenGenes (DeSantis et al., 2006) to obtain the taxonomic reference. ITS FASTQ results were analyzed with the UNITE database (Kõljalg et al., 2013) to analyze the reference sequences and for taxonomic assignment. The Shannon Index was calculated for alpha diversity for each sample with MiSeq control Software (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA, United States) while the Bray–Curtis (Anderson, 2001) statistics methods calculated beta diversity between samples.Total Anthocyanins Approximately 100 mg of each dry sample powder was placed in an ASE350 cell of the Dionex Automated Solvent Extraction System (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, United States) and extracted with a solvent mixture of methanol:water:acetic acid (MWA) 85:14.5:0.5 (V/V/V) (methanol and acetic acid; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). Parameters for the ASE 350 were: 100°C with 5 min static time; 70% flush; 90 s purge; 1 cycle; and 1500 psi. Extracts were analyzed immediately after extraction for total anthocyanin content by reading their absorbance at 530 and 650 nm (Beckman DU 700). A standard curve was created using Cyandin-3-Glycoside (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States).ORAC and Total Phenolic Content A separate extract was prepared for the determination, firstly, of the antioxidant capacity using the hydrophilic Oxygen Radical Adsorption Capacity (ORAC-FL) assay and secondly, the total phenolics in the sample. Twenty five milligrams (25 mg) of the freeze dried sample was placed in an ASE 350 cell and extracted with acetone:water:acetic acid (AWA) at the ratio of 70%:29.5%:0.5%. Parameters for the ASE 350 were: 80°C with 5 min static time; 60% flush; 60 s purge; 1 cycle; and 1500 psi. Aliquots of 0.2 ml were subsequently reacted with Folin-Ciocalteu phenol reagent (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) for the determination of total phenolics by the modified Folin-Ciocalteu assay (Prior et al., 2005). A series of known concentrations of gallic acid (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was prepared and reacted with the same reagent to create a calibration curve that was in turn used to determine the concentration in the sample extracts. Consequently, the total phenolics were expressed as gallic acid (GA) equivalents. A diluted (1/50) AWA extract was subjected to the ORAC-FL assay as described by Wu et al. (2004) and Prior et al. (2005). Specifically, dilutions of the AWA extracted samples were prepared in a 75 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0). Aliquots of 20 μL of the diluted sample were placed (in triplicate) in a 96 well transparent flat bottom microplate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), along with appropriately diluted Trolox [(±)-6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane- 2-carboxylic acid; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, United States] standards (in triplicate), under subdued light. A “forward-then-reverse” pattern was used to place samples in the microplates, and edge wells were not used for standards or samples due to possible plate effects. Samples were analyzed on a BioTek Synergy Hybrid plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, United States) which automatically added 200 μL of diluted fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) into each well, followed by 20 μL of the peroxyl radical generator (AAPH [2′2′azobis (2-amidinopropane)] Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). The assay was monitored every few minutes for 2 h, at 37°C. The ORAC-FL value was calculated from the area under the decay curve, and was reported as μmol Trolox equivalents (TE)/g dry weight.Elemental Analysis Dried and ground plant material (0.2–0.5 g) was digested in an open vessel system using a graphite-heating block (Mod Block, PN 4370-010007, CPI International). The plant material was digested at 95°C using a modification of the Environmental Protection Agency, (EPA) Method 3050B, as described below. A 5 ml aliquot of 70% nitric acid (70% Trace Metal Grade, Fisher Scientific, Suwanee, GA, United States) was added to the samples and then boiled for approximately 2 h (or until sample was completely clear). After cooling 2.5 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide (Fisher Scientific, Suwannee, GA, United States) was applied. When the peroxide reaction ceased, samples were reheated for an additional 50 m in covered vials. Samples were cooled overnight, diluted to 50 ml with ultra-pure DI water and then passed through a 25 mm 0.45 μm syringe filter (GE Whatman, Pittsburgh, PA, United States). Samples were analyzed via Inductively Coupled Optical Emission Spectrometry. (iCAP 7000 Series, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) A multi-element standard (Environmental Express) was diluted to the same acid concentration as the samples and quantification was done by external calibration.Statistical Analysis Data from microbiological counts (log transformed) and chemistry values were compared using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, United States). Alpha diversity was determined using the Shannon Diversity Index and was calculated by Illumina RDP Control Software (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Beta diversity of community sequencing was determined with Bray–Curtis dissimilarity (Anderson, 2001) using a one-way ANOVA (QIIME 2.0) (Bolyen et al., 2018). A t-test (Microsoft Excel) was done to compare differences in the percent phyla identified.Results Microbial Counts on Leaves and Roots VEG-01A was the first time the Veggie facility had been used for plant growth on ISS (Massa et al., 2017a, b) so presumably it would have been the least likely of the three plantings described in this study to harbor microbial contamination. Aerobic plate counts for the leaves harvested from VEG-01B flight plants were significantly higher than the counts from both harvests of VEG-03A flight and the ground controls (P < 0.05) (Figure 2). With the exception of VEG-01B, the flight and ground control aerobic plate counts on leaves were not significantly different. The bacterial counts on ground control samples from VEG-01B were significantly lower than the flight leaves by orders of magnitude (P < 0.0001) (Figure 2). Previous studies (Hummerick et al., 2010, 2012) have shown an increase in microbial counts with a repeated harvest or “cut and come again” protocol as was done in VEG-03A. An increase between the 2nd and 4th harvests was not seen in bacterial counts on the leaves, however, fungal counts in the flight leaves were significantly higher in the 4th harvest when compared to the 2nd harvest (P = 0.0002) (Figure 3). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Mean bacterial (A) and fungal (B) counts on Outredgeous leaves from three Veggie experiments. Bacterial counts are CFU on TSA per gram of frozen tissue and fungal counts are CFU from IMA plates. Error bars represent standard error of the mean. Horizontal lines indicate significance between flight samples. *P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗P < 0.001. Significant differences were determined using an ANOVA with Tukey’s post test to compare groups.FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Mean bacterial (A) and fungal (B) counts on Outredgeous roots from three Veggie grow outs. Bacterial counts are CFU on TSA per gram of frozen tissue and fungal counts are CFU on IMA plates. Error bars represent standard error of the mean. Horizontal lines indicate significance between flight samples. ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01. Significant differences were determined using an ANOVA with Tukey’s post test to compare groups.The bacterial counts on lettuce leaves grown on ISS in VEG-01A, B and both harvests from VEG-03A were relatively low on average, 3.53, 4.86, 2.89, and 2.14 log10 CFU/g respectively (Figure 2), when compared to farm or market produce counts of similar type (Valentin-Bon and Jacobson, 2008; Rastogi et al., 2012; Jackson et al., 2013; Holvoet et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015; Hagenmair and Baker, 2016; Oyinlola et al., 2017; Fröhling et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Fungal counts on Veggie grown lettuce ranging from 2.3 to 4.3 log10 CFU/g were within the range of yeast and mold counts on lettuce reported in the literature (Figure 3) (Oliveira et al., 2010). Bacterial counts from the roots in the VEG-03A grow out were significantly lower than the other two grow outs and lower than the corresponding ground control (Figure 3) although these counts were in a range of 106-108 per gram which is typical of lettuce root tissue (Riser et al., 1984; Adesina et al., 2009). Screening for potential food borne pathogens, E. coli, Salmonella sp., and S. aureus on the leaf tissue yielded negative results. These screening results were corroborated by NGS data.Cultivated Bacterial and Fungal Isolate Identification Cultivation of individual bacterial colony phenotypes on TSA from VEG-01 and VEG-03 samples yielded 14 genera identified from the leaf samples (Table 2) and 19 from the root samples (Table 3). It is important to note that culture based isolation utilized in this study is limited to the selection of the mostly dominant colony phenotypes that grew under aerobic conditions on one type of general growth media. A majority of the bacterial taxa isolated from the Veggie grown leaves are known endophytic and/or epiphytic phyllosphere commensals or symbionts including Arthrobacter (Scheublin and Leveau, 2013), Methylobacterium (Peredo and Simmons, 2018), Sphingomonas (Kim et al., 1998), Pantoea (Whipps et al., 2008), Burkholderia (Eberl and Vandamme, 2016), and Curtobacterium (Chase et al., 2016). Paenibacillus is ubiquitous in soil and is associated with plants predominately as a rhizosphere bacterium exhibiting plant growth promoting characteristics (Grady et al., 2016). A few of the leaf isolates are known to be transients on the surface of the leaf and are not typically part of the normal phyllosphere microbial community including Bacillus and Staphylococcus (Maduell et al., 2008; Dees et al., 2015). Human associated bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus were found on the leaves of both flight and ground samples from VEG-03A. These are not natural inhabitants of the plant phyllosphere, however certain strains can be pathogenic to humans and cause food borne illness under optimal growth conditions (Kadariya et al., 2014).

Open in a new tab Identification was completed with Biolog and/or MicroSEQ protocols. A ± indicates the presence or absence of each genus in flight or ground samples.The bacterial genera isolated from the roots (Table 3) are predominately associated with soil and plant phyllosphere and rhizosphere. Ten of the 19 root isolates were also recovered from the leaf samples excluding the four genera Macrococcus, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Sphingomonas. Nine genera of fungi were isolated and identified from leaf tissue (Table 4), while six were recovered from root (Table 5). All the fungal genera present in the roots were also present on the leaves with the exception of Alternaria. The fungi Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Alternaria are ubiquitous, saprophytic fungi often isolated from soil and the environment including ISS surface and air samples (Royer et al., 2004; Venkateswaran et al., 2017). Verma et al. (2011) found many of these genera of filamentous fungi as endophytes in the Indian Lily plant root. Among the fungi, the basidiomycete, Rhodotorula was the most common and in fact was isolated from every Veggie sample with the exception of the VEG-03 leaf tissue. TABLE 4.

A ± indicates the presence or absence of each genus in flight or ground samples.Community Sequencing Sampling and sequencing of the flight and ground Veggie grown plants were completed on a minimum of two root pillows and up to five leaf samples per grow out. Sequencing profiles for each of the Veggie plantings were used to calculate and investigate the Shannon Species Diversity Index (Alpha Diversity) (Table 6) and establish relative diversity within the bacterial communities in leaf and root and ground and flight samples. Leaf diversity was lower than root in each of the three lettuce crops and there was no significant difference between flight and ground samples (Table 6). Although diversity was similar in all roots or leaves, there appeared to be variation in the dominant genera. TABLE 6. Average Shannon Diversity Indices for three, independent Veggie experiments VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A, on the International Space Station and parallel ground studies.

Plus/minus values are standard deviation determined from three separate sample replicates within each experiment.Alpha diversity in leaf tissue of the three Veggie experiments showed a significant difference between ground and flight leaf samples of VEG-03A only (P = 0.01). VEG-01A and B flight samples were not significantly different from the respective ground samples. There was also no significant difference in Beta diversity between VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A experiments. Bray Curtis dissimilarity calculations comparing all three experiments were not significantly different between any leaf or root samples of the three tests (P > 0.05). A majority of the bacterial community sequencing at the phyla level were assigned to phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Comparison at the phyla taxonomic level indicated no significant difference between ground and flight root communities nor in the leaf communities. The dominant phyla for all plants, both ground and flight, was Proteobacteria. VEG-03A flight roots had the lowest percent of the Proteobacteria reads at 59% while the corresponding flight leaf sample was 76% of the total bacterial communities. All other plants from VEG-01A and B ranged from 80 to 96% Proteobacterial reads. However, this disparity was not significantly different. A closer look at the genera contained in the Veggie leaf and root samples showed that Burkholderia, Ralstonia, and Janthinobacterium dominated the Proteobacteria phyla (Figure 4). Other Proteobacteria present in the samples were Azospirillum, and Herbaspirillum, which were detected in higher abundance in VEG-03A as well as Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium, all of which may play a role in nitrogen fixation (Okubo et al., 2012). The dominant genera representing the Chloroflexi was the gram positive, thermophilic, Thermogemmatispora, a soil microbe (Komaki et al., 2016). These microbes were also transported to the leaf but were detected in much lower abundances (percentage), particularly in the flight and ground samples in VEG-03A. Thermogemmatispora was also detected in higher percentages than other microbes but was less than in VEG-03A. The dominant microbe representing the Bacteroidetes, which took second to the Proteobacteria in numerous samples was Chitinophaga. Chitinophaga was higher in abundance of reads in flight sample roots with only VEG-01B showing an elevated abundance in the ground samples (Figure 4). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Bacterial community for lettuce leaf (A) and root (B) tissue for VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A experiments. Flight experiments were grown on the ISS while ground controls were grown in Environmental Growth Chambers at Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States. Bacteria are the top genera obtained from next generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq.Fungal communities from VEG-01A and VEG-01B were surveyed and it was determined that the Ascomycota phyla dominated both flight and ground communities as well as leaf and root communities (92–99%). Few Basidiomycota were detectable. VEG-01A flight roots presented the highest representation at 7% with VEG-01B flight root community containing 6%. All other communities contained 2% or less of total fungi detected (Figure 5). FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Fungal community for lettuce leaf (A) and root (B) tissue for VEG-01A and VEG-01B experiments. Flight experiments were grown on the ISS while ground controls were grown in Environmental Growth Chambers at Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States. Fungi are the top genera obtained from next generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq.Fungal diversity in the root samples for both flight and ground was significantly higher than leaf – an expected outcome (P < 0.05). Among the dominating genera in flight and ground leaf samples was Microidium, an obligate biotroph (Braun and Cook, 2012; Meeboon and Takamatsu, 2017). Leaf samples also housed Alternaria, Fusarium (VEG-01B only), and Malassezia, a yeast like fungi. Root samples from all three growth tests had increased levels of Alternaria, Phaeoacremonium, and Rhodosporidiobolus (Figure 5). Alternaria was found in all samples with the exception of VEG-01A leaf tissue while Phaeoacremonium was present in increased abundance in VEG-01A root and in reduced numbers in VEG-01A leaf tissue (Figure 5). Comparison of culturable and non-culturable microbes in all samples provided corroborating evidence in that all culturable microbes were identified in the sequencing data. However, sequencing data revealed many additional genera present, increasing the species diversity.Elemental Analysis Leaf tissue from flight and ground experiments were analyzed for changes in elemental composition (Table 7). There was no significant differences between ground and flight samples within each experiment, however when comparing among all three experiments, Fe and K content were significantly lower in VEG-03A samples compared to VEG-01A and VEG-01B (Fe, P ≤ 0.001; K, P ≤ 0.0001). On the other hand, Na content was found to be significantly higher in VEG-01B compared to VEG-01A or VEG-03A (P ≤ 0.0001). Phosphate (P) measured among all three experiments showed that VEG-01B had higher P contents than VEG-01A and VEG-03A (P ≤ 0.05). Similarly, sulfate measured as S and Zn contents were statistically higher in VEG-01B compared to either VEG-01A or VEG-03A (S, P ≤ 0.05; Zn, P ≤ 0.0001). No significant differences were observed in either Ca, Mg, or Mn content. TABLE 7. Elemental content of lettuce leaf tissue from VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A ground and flight samples.

Comparing total phenolics, VEG-03A with 15.0 (ground) and 19.6 (flight) mg/g of dry weight (gallic acid equivalents) had the statistically lowest amounts when compared to either VEG-01A or VEG-01B (P ≤ 0.001). Anthocyanins measured as cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents showed no difference among all three experiments compared. Similarly, ORAC units measured among all three experiments did not exhibit any observable variance. TABLE 8.

However, it is reasonable to conclude that environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, water levels provided, the microbiota in the air on ISS, and possible human interaction at the time of growth and harvest may contribute to the microbial community and density on the surface of the leaves. Terrestrially, airborne bacteria and fungal spores can land on the surface of leaves and become a part of the epiphytic microbial community albeit transient and dynamic depending on selective pressures (Lindow and Brandl, 2003; Vokou et al., 2012; Maignien et al., 2014). Varying conditions such as humidity, leaf surface moisture and temperature can also effect the colonization and growth of bacteria and fungi on leaf surfaces. There is a positive correlation between fungal sporulation and the duration of leaf surface moisture (Talley et al., 2002; Li et al., 2014). Poor air circulation can cause persistent droplets of moisture on the surface of a leaf due to transpiration producing a micro environment favorable for microbial proliferation. In the case of the three Veggie plantings on the ISS, environmental data collected by HOBO data recorders (Supplementary Table S1) showed that temperature and humidity were slightly higher inside the Veggie chamber during the first 22 days of VEG-03A growth than the other two Veggie tests. Additionally, germinating seedlings in the VEG-03A test had excess moisture in the early period of growth, likely due to a fan malfunction, when compared to the VEG-01A and VEG-01B plants. It was during this experiment that our team identified a consistent anomaly with the Veggie hardware – specifically that when power is cycled to the hardware, upon restarting the fan will read “low” but it will actually be off. This problem also led to issues of excess moisture in an earlier Zinnia test but a repetition of this with lettuce confirmed the anomaly. In contrast, VEG-01A and VEG-01B tests had no fan issues, but instead the plants had some periods of low water early on (see Massa et al., 2017a). Given that Veggie is a manually watered system and that fluid behavior in microgravity differs considerably from that on Earth, these early Veggie experiments involved considerable variation in fluid addition as both the ground teams and the astronauts struggled to effectively water the crops. Logged data from VEG-03A were not collected for the duration of the 64 days experiment so it is speculative to conclude any correlation between microbial counts and Veggie chamber conditions. Key to this work is determining the microbiological food safety of Veggie grown crops. Bacterial and fungal counts on fresh plant material are not necessarily an indication of the food quality and microbiological safety of the item and vary depending on the type of plant (Leff and Fierer, 2013; Qadri et al., 2015). Studies show that leafy greens grown in the field or greenhouse have a range of approximately 4–8 log10 CFU bacterial counts per gram of sample while yeast and mold counts on lettuce are reported in the range of 2–5 log10 (Valentin-Bon and Jacobson, 2008; Rastogi et al., 2012; Jackson et al., 2013; Holvoet et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2015; Hagenmair and Baker, 2016; Oyinlola et al., 2017; Fröhling et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). The microbial counts on lettuce leaves grown on ISS in VEG-01A, B and both harvests from VEG-03A were relatively low on average when compared to farm or market produce counts of similar type. In addition, none of the target human pathogens were detected in culture based testing and 16S community sequencing. These results demonstrate that from a microbiological perspective the Outredgeous variety of lettuce grown in Veggie was safe for human consumption. Microbiological data collected from lettuce and reported in the literature provides evidence that different parts of the plant, i.e., leaves and roots support distinct microbial communities (Ibekwe and Grieve, 2004; Toju et al., 2019). While our culture based isolation of bacteria recovered a few species unique to leaves many of the isolates present on the phyllosphere were also present in the roots. Previous work on the relationship of the phyllosphere bacterial community and airborne bacteria by Vokou et al. (2012) demonstrated that colonization of the phyllosphere is not always related to the aerial microbial community within the plants proximity and may include commensal and symbiotic taxa as well as environmentally indigenous transients. Staphylococcus has been isolated on the ISS on both surfaces and in the air (Venkateswaran et al., 2014, 2017) so it is not unlikely that plants in Veggie chambers would be exposed to these types of bacteria. Microbiological surveys done on a variety of surfaces and materials on the ISS reported many of the same bacteria and fungi that we isolated from plant material grown in Veggie. We compared bacterial and fungal isolates from this study of Veggie grown plants with isolates described in a study by Venkateswaran et al. (2017) which characterized the microbiology of ISS surfaces. More than 50% of the genera of bacteria and 100% of the fungi isolated and identified on ISS surfaces were also isolated from Veggie samples. NASA reported monitoring results of space station samples including air surfaces and water from 1998 to 2012 using cultivation methods (Castro et al., 2004; Yamaguchi et al., 2014). In these studies, the two most commonly isolated genera from water samples collected between 2009 and 2012 were Burkholderia sp. and Ralstonia sp. These are persistent and common in station potable water as well as terrestrial water sources and have been isolated and identified from Space Shuttle potable water (Koenig and Pierson, 1997; Ryan et al., 2007) so it is not unexpected that these were also isolated in the roots and leaves of both flight and ground control plants. Plants, regardless of growth conditions, harbor an indigenous population that may affect plant health and, if utilized as a food source, human health. One of the important findings in this study is the similarity and densities in the dominant leaf and root microbial community members as those reported in the literature grown under very different conditions (Dees et al., 2015). Culturable microbes include approximately 10% of the community microbial participants. Research on core rhizosphere and phyllosphere associated bacterial microbiota (symbiotic and pathogenic) have been described using culture-independent sequencing methods (Panstruga and Kuhn, 2019). Next generation sequencing provides an alternative method to identify non-culturable microorganisms. It is important to identify these organisms as it may provide insight into the safety and health quality of the plants/crops being harvested and consumed. Each of the bacterial and fungal isolates identified in this study were confirmed with sequencing results, however, many additional genera were identified. Research studies indicate Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria phyla dominate communities, though differences may occur between host plant species at lower taxonomic levels (Panstruga and Kuhn, 2019). Sequencing data from the three Veggie experiments followed these trends. Lettuce leaf tissue in all three Veggie experiments was dominated with Thermogemmatispora, a gram positive, sporulating, soil organism that has been known to produce secondary metabolites provided to plants as a secondary resource (Komaki et al., 2016). Thermogemmatispora has been found in lettuce seeds in high abundance but was reduced in root and leaf tissues (unpublished data, Khodadad et al). Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium are also commonly found in soils as they may participate in nitrogen fixation (Okubo et al., 2012). Bradyrhizobium has also been noted in higher abundance in low nutrient soils (Okubo et al., 2012). Both microbes were present in higher abundance in flight root samples and were low or undetectable in leaf tissue with the highest abundance in VEG-03A roots. VEG-03A was grown for longer periods of time and may have depleted the nutrient levels in the substrate. In addition, microbes commonly associated with water were also detected in both leaf and root tissue. These microbes mentioned previously include Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Cupriavidus, and Pseudomonas were identified in all leaf and root samples of all three Veggie experiments. These have been identified as present on ISS as well as in the ISS water system (Castro et al., 2004; Checinska et al., 2015; Venkateswaran et al., 2017). It is important to note that several of the microbes identified may be potential endosymbionts with plants or fungi and be present as epiphytic or endophytic organisms. One example is Chitinophaga, found in all flight and ground root samples. Though it is unknown what the function of this bacteria may have been within these Veggie communities, it has been found to interact with fungal species present in plants by enhancing nutrient uptake and growth, altering plant water interactions or deterring potential pathogens (Shaffer et al., 2017). These interactions have the capability of shaping plant health and productivity by accessing and making additional carbon sources available (Kivlin et al., 2011; Shaffer et al., 2017). To determine their role and benefit to plants or fungi would require additional flight and ground studies. As fungi were present in each flight and ground sample community, it is important to note those in abundance and their persistence over time. Fungi have been detected on the ISS in various locations (Venkateswaran et al., 2014, 2017). Leaf and root systems of VEG-01A and B were surveyed for the presence of fungi and compared. Alternaria, Microidium, and Phaeoacremonium were the top three fungal genera identified with sequencing. Alternaria, an Ascomycota, has been described as a saprophyte that may decompose organic matter, and increase in communities with high humidity (Patriarca, 2016). They may also associate with other fungal genera such as Fusarium or Stachybotrys. Though neither of these fungal genera were identified in VEG-01A, both were first detected in VEG-01B samples with higher incidence in ground samples therefore, they may have been introduced as a contaminant. Phaeoacremonium is a plant associated endophyte previously associated with lettuce and woody plants (Mostert et al., 2005) while Microidium may be an opportunistic plant pathogen especially in high humidity environments (Braun and Cook, 2012; Meeboon and Takamatsu, 2017). Plants require macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (Fe, B, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mo) for their growth and development (Epstein, 1972). These elements are essential and play critical roles in multiple plant processes. Comparing all three experiments, VEG-01B had higher elemental contents for Na, P, S, and Zn, whereas VEG-03A had the lowest amounts for Fe and K. Considering the chronological order of the experiments onboard the ISS, VEG-01B was grown a year later than VEG-01A, which raises the possibility of a change in the ISS water, but that may not be the only variable as plants grown in microgravity experience stresses from environmental conditions, so it would be impractical to draw any conclusions from these differences. VEG-03A, which was grown 1.5 years after the VEG-01B, was the sequential harvest experiment. As described in section “Materials and Methods,” there were four repeated harvests (38, 45, 59, and 64 days after initiation) of this experiment and only two (day 45 and day 64) were returned to earth. Romaine lettuce in field settings can take 75 days to fully mature, however, controlled environment growth is generally faster. By the final harvest photos indicated that some of the plants seemed to be transitioning to a reproductive growth phase, so it is possible that stresses from space flight may have pushed the plants to initiate senescence and that could provide a possible explanation for slightly lower elemental levels of some elements in VEG-03A samples (Maillard et al., 2015). Similarly, differences in the levels of total phenolics among VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A samples could be attributed to the environmental conditions. There have been known challenges associated with irrigation of plants in the Veggie hardware and VEG-01 showed evidence of insufficient and excess (in case of zinnia, VEG-01C) water in the root zone (Massa et al., 2017a). Studies have shown that either insufficient watering (drought-like, Sarker and Oba, 2018) or over-watering leading to hypoxia (Rajapakse et al., 2009) can induce production of phenolic compounds and free-radical scavenging activities. Again, there are not enough data to make any conclusions about the effects of the sequential harvesting method on plant ionome or phenolic content and more robust experiments are needed. Numerous Veggie tests have been conducted on the ISS, the plant growth evaluated, and in some cases the leaves consumed. Three plantings of red romaine lettuce were considered here (VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A). Through culturable and non-culturable methods of microbial analysis, the Veggie tests demonstrated diverse microbial communities with no potential human pathogens detected and therefore could provide a safe supplement to the astronauts’ diet. Chemical analysis provided evidence of significant changes in elemental and antioxidant content which may be an important factor to consider for nutritional value in future, long duration, exploration missions.Data Availability Statement The datasets generated for this study can be found in GeneLab accessions: VEG01A: GLDS-267, VEG01B: GLDS-268, and VEG03A: GLDS-269.Author Contributions GM, RW, MR, and TS contributed to the design of the work with MH, LS, JR, and CK completing research and data analysis.

    "introduction": "Introduction Polyamines are organic cations that are prevalent in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are the most common polyamines in plants, although thermospermine and cadaverine have also been found in many species including Arabidopsis thaliana (Shevyakova et al., 2001; Knott et al., 2007). Polyamines exist both as free molecules and as conjugates to other small molecules, mainly hydroxycinnamic acids, or proteins (Bagni and Tassoni, 2001). Both free and conjugated polyamines are important for cellular processes including cell growth, cell division, transcription, translation, and cell death. Their positive charges allow for interactions with nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which affect the activities and stabilities of these molecules (for a review, see Hussain et al., 2011). Polyamines accumulate in certain plant tissues under many abiotic stresses including drought, salt, osmotic, and temperature stress, which all result in metabolic reprogramming and modifications to growth (Cuevas et al., 2008; Alet et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011). Polyamines may protect against these stresses in several ways, including by altering gene expression, increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and altering the cellular accumulation of ions (Liu et al., 2000; Takahashi et al., 2003; Tang and Newton, 2005). They may also function as signals that regulate cross-talk between hormonal pathways during stress responses (Obata and Fernie, 2012). Though essential for proper development, and beneficial at higher levels during stress, catabolism of polyamines produces H2O2 (Tisi et al., 2011). Although it is toxic, H2O2 also diffuses to nearby tissues where it activates various responses (Neill, 2002). To balance these effects, polyamine synthesis, degradation, localization, and conjugation must be tightly controlled. Five potential Arabidopsis POLYAMINE UPTAKE TRANSPORTER (PUT) proteins were identified based on sequence similarity to known polyamine transporters in Leishmania major and Trympanosoma cruzi (Mulangi et al., 2012a, b ). When expressed in the polyamine uptake-deficient Δagp2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant (Aouida et al., 2005), these proteins partially restored sensitivity to the polyamine analogue paraquat as well as to putrescine and spermidine. They also partially restored putrescine and spermidine uptake into the cells (Mulangi et al., 2012a ). PAR1/PUT2 has subsequently been shown to localize to the Golgi where it is required for the subcellular localization of paraquat in the chloroplast (Li et al., 2013). RMV1/PUT3 has been shown to be plasma membrane associated and to function in paraquat, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine uptake in Arabidopsis (Fujita et al., 2012). However, cadaverine transport by these proteins was not tested. Less is known about cadaverine compared with the other polyamines. It is synthesized from lysine and therefore not directly derived from the polyamine putrescine, unlike spermidine, spermine, and thermospermine. Cadaverine is produced by some soil bacteria and yeast, possibly contributing to rhizosphere–root signalling (Perrig et al., 2007; Cloete et al., 2009). Exogenous cadaverine affects root development in several ways: it increases adventitious root growth in pine trees, lateral root formation in soybeans, and root weight in rice (Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991; Niemi et al., 2002; Cassán et al., 2009), whereas it shortens primary roots in soybeans (Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991). Cadaverine levels and localization change upon exposure to stress. This molecule accumulates dramatically upon oxidative stress in rape leaves and upon drought stress in peppers (Aziz et al., 1997; Sziderics et al., 2010). In the ice plant, salt stress causes cadaverine to accumulate in true leaves (Kuznetsov et al., 2007), and heat shock stimulates cadaverine transport away from the heated tissue (Shevyakova et al., 2001). Cadaverine also confers protection against stress. It induces stomatal closure, a common stress response, in fava beans (Liu et al., 2000), and it prevents decreases in root and shoot weight upon oxidative stress in rice (Cassán et al., 2009). Despite its profound impacts on overall cellular homeostasis and plant growth under stressful conditions, the underlying mechanisms that explain how cadaverine alters plant growth and development are still unknown. To address this gap, natural variation in root length sensitivity to exogenous cadaverine was examined, and ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 (OCT1, AT1G73220) was identified as an important quantitative trait locus (QTL) involved in this response.",

    "results": "Results Arabidopsis accessions vary in their root length responses to cadaverine As a first step toward identifying genes involved in root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine, seedlings of eight Arabidopsis accessions were grown on media containing 0, 100, and 500 μM cadaverine. A decrease in root length between control and increasing cadaverine treatments was observed for all accessions tested (Fig. 1A). Alterations in root waving and skewing and an increase in adventitious and lateral root emergence were also noticed in most accessions (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). In terms of root length, Cvi-1 and Knox-18 were some of the most resistant accessions to cadaverine, whereas Ler-2 was one of the most sensitive (Fig. 1A, B). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Arabidopsis accessions show varying root length inhibition responses to exogenous cadaverine. (A) Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 d and then at a 30 ° backward tilt for another 3 d. Average root length on control medium was set to 1. Absolute average root lengths on control medium were 1.4, 1.6, 2.5, 2.1, 2.1, 2.3, 2.0, and 2.3cm in the accessions as shown from left to right. The asterisk indicates the first cadaverine concentration corresponding to a significantly shorter root compared with control medium (P<0.05, Student’s t-test). Error bars indicate ±SE, and n=12–27. (B) Images of Cvi-1 (top) and Ler-2 (bottom) seedlings growing on media without (left) and with (right) 100 μM cadaverine. The white scale bar is 1cm. (C) Average length of epidermal cells in the mature root zone from seedlings grown vertically for 7 d on either control medium or medium containing 100 μM cadaverine. Error bars indicate ±SE, and n=11–18.To determine whether the effect of cadaverine on root length was due to reduced cell elongation or division, the length of the epidermal cells in the mature root zone of Ler seedlings grown on media containing 0 μM or 100 μM cadaverine was measured. It was found that although Ler roots were only ~35% as long on this concentration of cadaverine as on control medium (Fig. 1A), the average cell length of the seedlings on the medium containing cadaverine was ~64% of that of seedlings on control medium (Fig. 1C). This suggests that the reduction in root length is probably due to a combination of reduced cell elongation and division. A QTL on chromosome 1 affects root length responses to cadaverine Due to the large difference between Cvi and Ler in root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine, a QTL study was performed with a group of RILs created from the two accessions. Other pairs of accessions would have been equally interesting to use for QTL analysis but, at the time this experiment was initiated, the Cvi×Ler population was the available population created from accessions with the most differing cadaverine responses. These RILs were previously characterized for genotypic contribution from the two parental lines along the five chromosomes (Alonso-Blanco et al., 1998). For both the parental lines and the RILs, root growth on medium containing cadaverine compared with growth on control plates lacking this compound was quantified. RIL mean root length ratios showed transgression with respect to the parental means (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, growth on 0 μM and 50 μM cadaverine displayed broad sense heritability values of 0.46 and 0.56, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that this population is well suited for QTL mapping of root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab QTL analysis of root length responses to cadaverine in the Cvi/Ler RIL population. (A) Histogram showing root length ratios for the RILs on 100 μM cadaverine compared with control medium. (B) Composite interval mapping analysis for the root length ratio. The top portion of the graph gives the LOD score across each chromosome. The LOD significance threshold is shown as a horizontal line across the graph. The bottom graph shows the additive value toward the phenotype of each genomic region with respect to the Ler allele. (C) Two-dimensional QTL scan for the root length ratio from trial 1. The x- and y-axes represent positions along each chromosome. The region of the plot below the diagonal gives the additive QTL model, while the region above the diagonal shows epistatic interactions. A scale relating colour to LOD score is provided on the right of the heat map. Numbers on the left of this scale represent LOD scores for the epistatic portion of the plot, whereas those on the right represent scores for the additive model. The arrows indicate the significance thresholds for the epistatic (left) and additive (right) portions of the plot.Using both composite interval mapping and a 2D scan approach, a strong QTL for relative root growth response to cadaverine was identified at the end of chromosome 1 in two independent trials (Fig. 2B). The additive portion of the QTL graph (Fig. 2B, bottom) predicts that having a Ler allele at this location results in a shorter root upon cadaverine treatment compared with a Cvi allele. No epistasis was observed between this QTL and other parts of the genome (Fig. 2C). Near isogenic lines confirm the chromosome 1 QTL Six NILs with Cvi introgression of varying segments of chromosome 1 within an otherwise Ler background (Keurentjes et al., 2007) were used to confirm the root length QTL. The four LCN1 lines that contain a Cvi introgression at the end of chromosome 1 showed greater, more Cvi-like resistance to cadaverine than LCN1-12 and LCN1-22, the NILs that do not contain a Cvi introgression in this region (Fig. 3). The Ler to Cvi breakpoints in these lines were fine-mapped, and the candidate region was narrowed to a 5.3Mb interval at the end of chromosome 1 (primers shown in Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Cadaverine root length responses of chromosome 1 NILs and fine mapping. Relative root lengths on media containing 0, 100, and 500 μM cadaverine are shown. Plants were grown at a 30 ° backward tilt for 6 d. The average root length on control medium was set to 1. Absolute average root lengths on control medium were 1.0, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.1, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.1cm in the lines as shown from left to right. The asterisk indicates the first concentration on which the root length was significantly different from the length on control medium (P<0.05, Student’s t-test). Error bars indicate ±SE, and n=18–34. In the diagram of chromosome 1 NILs (bottom), white bars are Ler chromosomal regions, black bars are Cvi regions, and grey bars indicate regions in which the breakpoint is undetermined. The parallel dashed lines flank the probable region of a locus controlling root length responses to cadaverine. Accession breakpoints were determined using primers based on polymorphisms described by Monsanto/CEREON between Columbia and Ler (Jander et al., 2002). Identification of candidate genes for the chromosome 1 QTL Because many of the causative loci behind the QTL are due to differences in gene expression (Alonso-Blanco et al., 2009), gene expression differences between Cvi and Ler were examined in the candidate region using previously published microarray data (Vaughn and Masson, 2011). The primary data are publicly available at Gene Expression Omnibus (; accession number GSE28275). From these arrays, 19 probe sets representing genes located in the candidate chromosomal segment give hybridization signals that differ significantly (95% confidence interval) by ≥2-fold between Cvi and Ler (Table 1). The largest predicted differentially expressed gene in this region was OCT1, which was estimated to show a 73-fold increase in Cvi compared with Ler. Table 1.

Genes encoding a transglutaminase (At1g69820) and a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (At1g72680), both possibly linked to the formation of polyamine conjugates (Serafini-Fracassini and Del Duca, 2008; Fellenberg et al., 2009), are found in this QTL interval; however, they do not show ≥2-fold expression differences between Cvi and Ler. OCT1 from Cvi and Ler genomic DNA was sequenced. No large insertions or deletions were found, and only one amino acid change was found: residue 431 in the second exon is serine in Cvi and alanine in Ler (Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). Analysing the 2kb of sequence upstream of the start codon revealed numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions but no large insertions or deletions (Supplementary Table S2). Based on these data, it was hypothesized that OCT1 expression differences contribute to root length responses to exogenous cadaverine. qRT-PCR data confirmed the microarray result and showed that OCT1 expression was ~14 times as high in Cvi roots as in Ler roots (Fig. 4). Cadaverine treatment did not significantly change OCT1 expression in either accession (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab OCT1 expression relative to the reference gene At1G58050 is higher in Cvi roots than in Ler roots. Seedlings were grown on 0 μM or 50 μM cadaverine. Error bars indicate ±SE among biological replicates, and OCT1 expression for Ler on control medium was set to 1. The asterisk indicates a significant difference in expression compared with Ler for the given condition (P<0.05, Student’s t-test). Differences within each accession between cadaverine treatments are not significant. oct1-1 mutants express a truncated OCT1 transcript To evaluate a role for OCT1 in root length responses to cadaverine, the oct1-1 mutant, which was previously found to carry a single T-DNA insertion near the 3’ end of the gene, was obtained; both ends of the insertion were characterized (Lelandais-Brière et al., 2007). This mutant was also reported to not express any OCT1 RNA, as determined by RT–PCR using primers aligning on each side of the intron (Lelandais-Brière et al., 2007). To confirm this result, RT–PCR was performed on oct1-1 and (Wassilewskija) WS wild-type root RNA samples. As expected, PCR products were obtained from WS wild-type cDNA samples of the expected sizes using multiple primer sets (1F/1R, 2F/2R, and 3F/3R) (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). Also, no transcript was observed for oct1-1 mutants using primer sets near the 3′ end of the gene (2F/2R, 3F/3R, and 2F/4R) (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, it was found that oct1-1 plants do express a partial OCT1 transcript using primers on each side of the intron (1F/1R) (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). This product size corresponds to approximately the predicted length if the intron is not spliced out of the RNA (238 bases instead of 135 bases), which would result in a premature stop codon in the intron. No product for any primer set was detected in control reactions without reverse transcriptase, which confirms the lack of genomic DNA contamination (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, oct1-1 produces a truncated OCT1 transcript that is highly unlikely to encode a functional protein. oct1-1 shows increased cadaverine sensitivity If Ler roots have higher sensitivity to cadaverine compared with Cvi roots because they have lower OCT1 expression, then oct1 mutant roots should also respond more strongly to cadaverine than wild-type plants. To test this, WS wild type, oct1-1, and two independent transgenic rescue lines (oct1-1 [35Spro:OCT1WS]) were grown on control medium and medium supplemented with cadaverine. Rescue line 1 had significantly higher OCT1 expression compared with the WS wild type, whereas rescue line 2 had a similar level of OCT1 expression (Fig. 5A). It was found that all of these plants had the same root length on control medium lacking cadaverine, but oct1-1 mutant roots were significantly shorter than wild-type roots on media containing 50 μM and 500 μM cadaverine (Fig. 5B). Robust root growth on medium containing cadaverine was restored in both independent transgenic rescue lines. Rescue line 2 showed a wild-type-like response to cadaverine, and rescue line 1 showed increased resistance to cadaverine (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that reduced OCT1 expression confers increased cadaverine sensitivity. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab oct1-1 roots are more sensitive to exogenous cadaverine compared with wild-type plants but respond similarly to putrescine-derived polyamines. (A) OCT1 expression relative to the reference gene At1G58050 is shown. Error bars indicate ±SE among biological replicates, and OCT1 expression for the WS wild type on control medium was set to 1. The asterisk indicates a significant difference in expression compared with the WS wild type (P<0.05, Student’s t-test). The abbreviation n.d. indicates that expression was not detected. (B) Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 ° backward tilt on media containing 0, 50, and 500 μM cadaverine. Root tips were marked after 3 d of growth, and the root growth over the following 3 d was measured for each treatment. Average root growth over the final 3 d on control medium was 1.2cm for the wild type, 1.4cm for oct1-1, 1.3cm for rescue line 1, and 1.4cm for rescue line 2; these lengths were set to 1. For each cadaverine concentration, the letters indicate significant differences in relative root length (P<0.01, pairwise Student’s t-tests). n=37–68, and error bars indicate ±SE. (C) Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 ° backward tilt on media containing various concentrations of polyamines as indicated. Average root length on control medium was 1.3cm for the wild type and 1.4cm for oct1-1; these lengths were set to 1. n=33–44, and error bars indicate ±SE. No significant root length differences were observed for any treatment other than cadaverine (P<0.05, Student’s t-test).The WS wild type and oct1-1 had similar root lengths on media containing the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (Fig. 5C), which shows that this sensitivity is specific to cadaverine. Polyamines have been shown to shorten root growth through the generation of H2O2 by diamine and polyamine oxidases, which promotes premature cell differentiation and programmed cell death (Tisi et al., 2011). However, because the cadaverine-hypersensitive response of oct1-1 was specific to cadaverine (Fig. 5C), OCT1 probably functions in a different aspect of polyamine-mediated root growth regulation. The expression level of OCT1, not its accession origin, correlates with cadaverine sensitivity To determine if differences in the OCT1 sequence between Cvi and Ler or only OCT1 expression levels correlated with the cadaverine response, OCT1 was cloned from Cvi and Ler, and these constructs were introduced into oct1-1 mutants. These transgenic lines were then tested on media containing 0 μM and 50 μM cadaverine, and their relative root lengths were measured. A range of cadaverine resistance levels that did not correlate with the accession source of the transgene was found (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Higher OCT1 expression correlates with cadaverine resistance. OCT1Cvi and OCT1Ler indicate oct1-1 [OCT1pro:OCT1Cvi] and oct1-1 [OCT1pro:OCT1Ler], respectively. (A) Relative root lengths of plants on media containing 0 μM and 50 μM cadaverine. Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 ° backward tilt. Average root length on control medium was set to 1. Absolute average root length on control medium was 2.2cm for Cvi, 1.9cm for Ler, 2.0cm for WS, 2.0cm for oct1-1, and 1.9, 2.0, 1.7, and 2.1cm for the transgenic lines as shown from left to right. Error bars indicate ±SE, and n=17–24. (B) Root OCT1 expression determined by qRT-PCR is shown relative to the reference gene At1G58050. OCT1 expression in Ler was set to 1. Error bars indicate ±SE among the biological replicates. The abbreviation n.d. indicates that expression was not detected.Because the insertion location can affect transgene expression, it was predicted that the OCT1 expression levels would correlate with cadaverine sensitivity. To test this, OCT1 expression was measured in four of these lines by qRT-PCR. As expected, a range of OCT1 expression levels was found in the transgenic lines regardless of whether the OCT1 untranslated and coding regions came from Cvi or Ler. In general, lines with increased resistance to cadaverine had higher OCT1 expression (Fig. 6). Genes other than OCT1 probably also contribute to the cadaverine response The data suggest that differences in OCT1 expression contribute significantly to the different cadaverine root length responses in Cvi and Ler. To determine if differences in OCT1 expression among other natural accessions also correlate with variability in cadaverine sensitivity, OCT1 expression was measured in two other accessions, one resistant to cadaverine (Knox-18) and one sensitive to cadaverine (Sq-8). It was found that both lines had higher OCT1 expression than Ler even though only Knox-18 was more resistant to cadaverine than Ler. Furthermore, Sq-8 displayed higher OCT1 expression than Knox-18 despite being more sensitive to cadaverine (Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online). The OCT1 sequences of the eight natural accessions initially selected for the analysis of cadaverine response were also compared. Polymorphisms shared among the three most resistant accessions (Cvi-1, Knox-18, and Ull2-3) or the three most sensitive accessions (An-1, Ler-2, and Sq-8) were not seen (Supplementary Table S2). Together, these data suggest that factors other than OCT1 expression may also contribute significantly to differential cadaverine sensitivity among these accessions. Ectopic copies of OCT1 derived from Cvi or Ler were also introduced into Columbia and Ler wild-type plants. Ler root length is highly sensitive to cadaverine, whereas Columbia root length is less sensitive to it. In general, the Columbia plants showed a range of responses to cadaverine regardless of the accession from which the transgene was derived (Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online). This result is similar to that obtained when these constructs were transformed into the oct1-1 mutant (Fig. 6). In contrast, when these constructs were transformed into Ler plants, the tested lines generally did not show increased resistance to cadaverine (Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, the ability of OCT1 to affect the cadaverine response may depend on the genetic background.",
    "discussion": "Discussion It was found that Arabidopsis roots exhibited varying responses to exogenously applied cadaverine depending on the accession. In general, when cadaverine concentrations increased, a reduction in root length as well as alterations in skewing, lateral root branching, and root waving were seen. The reduction in root length is probably due to a combination of reduced cell division and expansion. A major QTL was identified on chromosome 1 that at least partially explains the root length difference in response to cadaverine between Cvi and Ler. By comparing phenotypes and gene expression in natural accessions, a mutant, and transgenic lines, OCT1 was identified as a key gene involved in this response. Restoring OCT1 expression in the mutant background resulted in a positive correlation between OCT1 expression levels and cadaverine resistance. Because the OCT1 expression levels in other natural accessions do not correlate well with cadaverine resistance, other genes are also likely to contribute to the variation of this trait between Arabidopsis accessions. These genes could contribute to endogenous cadaverine homeostasis, transport, and/or response. Unfortunately, the levels of endogenous cadaverine in Arabidopsis seedling roots and shoots were below the level of detection using HPLC methods, preventing a distinction from being made between these possibilities. OCT1 encodes an organic cation transporter. In animals, OCT proteins take up a wide variety of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, and, therefore, they affect substrate absorption, distribution, and excretion in many tissues. Most are polyspecific, and transport can occur in either direction (for a review, see Roth et al., 2012). Arabidopsis OCT1 is one of six OCT-like proteins in Arabidopsis (Lelandais-Brière et al., 2007). It was previously reported to localize to the plasma membrane, and promoter–β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusions showed activity in the vasculature of many organs including roots (Lelandais-Brière et al., 2007; Küfner and Koch, 2008). Because the other six OCT-like proteins localize to the tonoplast rather than the plasma membrane, it is likely that OCT1 has a different function. The present work expands on these studies and suggests a role for OCT1 in affecting root growth responses to cadaverine. Future experiments will be aimed at clarifying the mechanism by which this occurs. One possibility is that OCT1 transports cadaverine away from elongating root cells and through the vasculature, causing it to accumulate in aerial tissues. Alternatively, cadaverine may alter the transport of another molecule through the membranes. Polyamines block many kinds of channels in multiple organisms. For example, spermine and spermidine directly block fast vacuolar cation channels in barley (Bruggemann et al., 1998), and all natural polyamines including cadaverine can regulate cation channel activity through cytoplasmic pathways (Liu et al., 2000; Shabala et al., 2007). It has been demonstrated that exogenous cadaverine affects Arabidopsis root morphology and that there is natural variation in this response due in part to varying expression levels of OCT1. This work has potential implications for better understanding how polyamines contribute to development and mediate stress responses.",

Copyright notice ID: 4321547 PMID: 25403917 Highlight How the polyamine cadaverine alters plant development is poorly understood. Here it is shown that natural variation in ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 affects root length sensitivity to exogenous cadaverine. Key words: Arabidopsis, cadaverine, natural variation, polyamines, roots, transporter.Abstract Polyamines, including cadaverine, are organic cations that affect numerous biological processes including transcription, translation, cell signalling, and ion channel activity. They often function in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Because little is known about how plants respond to cadaverine, a quantitative natural variation approach was used to identify genetic factors that contribute to this response. Here it is shown that Arabidopsis thaliana accessions have varying root length responses to exogenous cadaverine: Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) was one of the most resistant accessions tested, whereas Landsberg erecta (Ler) was one of the most sensitive. Recombinant inbred lines, near isogenic lines, and a microarray were used to show that variation in ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 (OCT1) is at least partially responsible for this difference. OCT1 expression was higher in Cvi than in Ler, and oct1 mutants were more sensitive to cadaverine than wild-type plants. In oct1 mutants transformed with an ectopic copy of OCT1 originating from either Cvi or Ler, the expression level of the transgene, not its accession, correlated with the cadaverine response. These results suggest that decreased OCT1 expression confers cadaverine sensitivity in some accessions.Introduction Polyamines are organic cations that are prevalent in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are the most common polyamines in plants, although thermospermine and cadaverine have also been found in many species including Arabidopsis thaliana (Shevyakova et al., 2001; Knott et al., 2007). Polyamines exist both as free molecules and as conjugates to other small molecules, mainly hydroxycinnamic acids, or proteins (Bagni and Tassoni, 2001). Both free and conjugated polyamines are important for cellular processes including cell growth, cell division, transcription, translation, and cell death. Their positive charges allow for interactions with nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which affect the activities and stabilities of these molecules (for a review, see Hussain et al., 2011). Polyamines accumulate in certain plant tissues under many abiotic stresses including drought, salt, osmotic, and temperature stress, which all result in metabolic reprogramming and modifications to growth (Cuevas et al., 2008; Alet et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011). Polyamines may protect against these stresses in several ways, including by altering gene expression, increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and altering the cellular accumulation of ions (Liu et al., 2000; Takahashi et al., 2003; Tang and Newton, 2005). They may also function as signals that regulate cross-talk between hormonal pathways during stress responses (Obata and Fernie, 2012). Though essential for proper development, and beneficial at higher levels during stress, catabolism of polyamines produces H2O2 (Tisi et al., 2011). Although it is toxic, H2O2 also diffuses to nearby tissues where it activates various responses (Neill, 2002). To balance these effects, polyamine synthesis, degradation, localization, and conjugation must be tightly controlled. Five potential Arabidopsis POLYAMINE UPTAKE TRANSPORTER (PUT) proteins were identified based on sequence similarity to known polyamine transporters in Leishmania major and Trympanosoma cruzi (Mulangi et al., 2012a, b ). When expressed in the polyamine uptake-deficient Δagp2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant (Aouida et al., 2005), these proteins partially restored sensitivity to the polyamine analogue paraquat as well as to putrescine and spermidine. They also partially restored putrescine and spermidine uptake into the cells (Mulangi et al., 2012a ). PAR1/PUT2 has subsequently been shown to localize to the Golgi where it is required for the subcellular localization of paraquat in the chloroplast (Li et al., 2013). RMV1/PUT3 has been shown to be plasma membrane associated and to function in paraquat, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine uptake in Arabidopsis (Fujita et al., 2012). However, cadaverine transport by these proteins was not tested. Less is known about cadaverine compared with the other polyamines. It is synthesized from lysine and therefore not directly derived from the polyamine putrescine, unlike spermidine, spermine, and thermospermine. Cadaverine is produced by some soil bacteria and yeast, possibly contributing to rhizosphere–root signalling (Perrig et al., 2007; Cloete et al., 2009). Exogenous cadaverine affects root development in several ways: it increases adventitious root growth in pine trees, lateral root formation in soybeans, and root weight in rice (Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991; Niemi et al., 2002; Cassán et al., 2009), whereas it shortens primary roots in soybeans (Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991). Cadaverine levels and localization change upon exposure to stress. This molecule accumulates dramatically upon oxidative stress in rape leaves and upon drought stress in peppers (Aziz et al., 1997; Sziderics et al., 2010). In the ice plant, salt stress causes cadaverine to accumulate in true leaves (Kuznetsov et al., 2007), and heat shock stimulates cadaverine transport away from the heated tissue (Shevyakova et al., 2001). Cadaverine also confers protection against stress. It induces stomatal closure, a common stress response, in fava beans (Liu et al., 2000), and it prevents decreases in root and shoot weight upon oxidative stress in rice (Cassán et al., 2009). Despite its profound impacts on overall cellular homeostasis and plant growth under stressful conditions, the underlying mechanisms that explain how cadaverine alters plant growth and development are still unknown. To address this gap, natural variation in root length sensitivity to exogenous cadaverine was examined, and ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 (OCT1, AT1G73220) was identified as an important quantitative trait locus (QTL) involved in this response.Materials and methods Plant materials QTL analysis used the following stocks from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH, USA): Cape Verde Islands (Cvi; CS8580), Landsberg erecta-2 Ler-2; CS8581), and a population of Cvi/Ler recombinant inbred lines (RILs; CS22000). This population consists of 162 individual RILs that were genotyped at 293 marker loci (Alonso-Blanco et al., 1998). The near isogenic lines (NILs) LCN1-12, -15, -14, -21, -22, and -28 (N717058, N17060, N17061, N17067, N17068, and N17074) (Keurentjes et al., 2007) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (Nottingham, UK). An-1 (CS22626), Bs-1 (CS6627), Knox-18 (CS22567), Sq-8 (CS22601), Ull2-3 (CS22587), and Wei-0 (CS22622) seed came from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The oct1-1 mutant and oct1-1 [35Spro:OCT1WS] transgenic lines were provided by Christine Lelandais-Briere (Lelandais-Brière et al., 2007).Growth conditions The seeds were sterilized by washing them with 95% ethanol. Except where noted in the text, they were plated on half-strength buffered Linsmaier and Skoog medium containing micro- and macronutrients, vitamins, and 1.5% sucrose (Caisson Laboratories, North Logan, UT, USA) that was supplemented with 1.5% agar type E (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and polyamines (Sigma-Aldrich) as required. The seedlings were stratified for 2–8 d and grown in either a Conviron TC16 growth chamber or an Enconair (now BioChambers, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) Controller 6000 growth chamber for each experiment. Both chambers were set at 22 °C and a 16h light/8h dark cycle, and the light intensity was 50–70 μmol m–2 s–1 and provided by cool-white fluorescent bulbs (Grainger, Lake Forest, IL, USA).Root length measurements Seedling images were taken from the backs of the plates using a scanner (Epson, Suwa, Nagano Prefecture, Japan). Root length was measured using the segmented line tool in  Image (publically available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) or the Neuron J plugin (Meijering et al., 2004) for Image J (Schneider et al., 2012).Microscopy To calculate cell length, the cell walls were stained by transferring the seedlings to 10 μg ml–1 propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) for ~20min. Imaging was conducted using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA), and cell length measurements were performed in Adobe Photoshop.QTL mapping Plants were grown at a 30 ° tilt for 6 d on media with or without cadaverine. A concentration of 50 μM cadaverine was used in trial 1, and 100 μM cadaverine was used in trial 2. The mean root length value on medium containing cadaverine was subtracted from the mean value on control medium and then divided by the mean on control medium. This number was subtracted from 1, and this ratio, along with genotypic data for each RIL (Alonso-Blanco et al., 1998), was entered into WinQTL Cartographer version 2.5 (Wang et al., 2010) and the r/qtl package in R (http://www.r-project.org). For WinQTL Cartographer, maps were created using the Kosambi map function. During composite interval mapping, the model incorporated a 0.5 step rate with a 1.0 cM window size and 10 control markers. LOD thresholds were determined by 1000 permutations. In r/qtl, the function ‘scanone’ was used for interval mapping, and ‘scantwo’ was used to generate the two-dimensional plot. Significance levels were determined by 1000 permutations, implementing the EM algorithm. Fine mapping of the NILs was performed using standard methods and the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1 available at JXB online.RT–PCR and qRT-PCR Approximately 24 seedlings were grown at a 30 ° backward tilt at staggered times for each biological replicate on medium containing no cadaverine unless otherwise indicated. Whole roots from 7-day-old seedlings were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was prepared using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, The Netherlands) and stored at –80 ºC until use, typically within a few days. RNA samples were treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the instructions. The ratios at absorbencies of 260 to 280 and at 260 to 230 as well as gel electrophoresis were used to verify RNA quality. Poor quality samples were not used for subsequent experiments. RNA concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR), cDNA was made using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), cDNA synthesis and qRT–PCR were done simultaneously using a qScript™ One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The samples were run on a LightCycler® 480 Real Time-PCR System (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). Each 6 μl reaction contained RNA at a final concentration of 2ng μl–1 and each primer at a concentration of 0.65 μM. Other components were included at the concentrations defined by the kit. Control reactions without reverse transcriptase were included and did not yield any detectable expression. Cycling conditions were 49 ºC for 10min, 95 ºC for 5min, and 45 cycles of 95 ºC for 5 s, 55 ºC for 15 s, and 72 ºC for 10 s. Melt curves were used to verify specificity. Four technical replicates were performed for each sample for each biological replicate, and three biological replicates were performed. LinRegPCR was used to analyse the data (Ramakers et al., 2003). The primers used to amplify OCT1 were: 1F (5′ GTGGCTGTT CCTTCCACACT 3′), 1R (5′ AAAGGCCGTGACGAAAGTTA 3′), 2F (5′ CATCCTCGACAGCGTATGAC 3′), 2R (5′ CCTTC CTAACGCAACTAGCA 3′), 3F (5′ TTTGGTGTTGCATCAGTG CT 3′), and 3R (5′ CGGAGCGTTTCGAGTTTCT 3′). 4R (5′ CGTGAAATGCGTGTTGAAAG 3′) was used to detect possible transcript that extended into the T-DNA region. Primers 3F and 3R as well as 5′ CCTCTTGGATACGCGGTTT 3′ and 5′ CAAGA AGCCATCGAGGAGAC 3′ were used for OCT1 qRT–PCR. Primers used to amplify the reference gene At1g58050 (Czechowski et al., 2005) were: 5′ CCATTCTACTTTTTGGCGGCT 3′ and 5′ TCAATGGTAACTGATCCACTCTGATG 3′. This reference gene was chosen due to its consistent expression and its similar expression level to OCT1 (Czechowski et al., 2005)Transgenic constructs Genomic DNA from Cvi and Ler was used to amplify the region extending from 2079 bases before the start codon through to 417 bases after the stop codon of OCT1. This region was cloned in between the attL1 and attL2 sites in the Gateway entry vector pENTR/D-TOPO (Life Technologies, Madison, WI, USA). An LR reaction was performed to transfer this region into the binary vector pMDC99 (Curtis and Grossniklaus, 2003; Xu and Li, 2008). The constructs were sequenced and transformed into plants using the Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). T3 seedlings likely to all carry the transgene as determined by antibiotic resistance were used in all experiments (Harrison et al., 2006).Results Arabidopsis accessions vary in their root length responses to cadaverine As a first step toward identifying genes involved in root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine, seedlings of eight Arabidopsis accessions were grown on media containing 0, 100, and 500 μM cadaverine. A decrease in root length between control and increasing cadaverine treatments was observed for all accessions tested (Fig. 1A). Alterations in root waving and skewing and an increase in adventitious and lateral root emergence were also noticed in most accessions (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). In terms of root length, Cvi-1 and Knox-18 were some of the most resistant accessions to cadaverine, whereas Ler-2 was one of the most sensitive (Fig. 1A, B). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Arabidopsis accessions show varying root length inhibition responses to exogenous cadaverine. (A) Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 d and then at a 30 ° backward tilt for another 3 d. Average root length on control medium was set to 1. Absolute average root lengths on control medium were 1.4, 1.6, 2.5, 2.1, 2.1, 2.3, 2.0, and 2.3cm in the accessions as shown from left to right. The asterisk indicates the first cadaverine concentration corresponding to a significantly shorter root compared with control medium (P<0.05, Student’s t-test). Error bars indicate ±SE, and n=12–27. (B) Images of Cvi-1 (top) and Ler-2 (bottom) seedlings growing on media without (left) and with (right) 100 μM cadaverine. The white scale bar is 1cm. (C) Average length of epidermal cells in the mature root zone from seedlings grown vertically for 7 d on either control medium or medium containing 100 μM cadaverine. Error bars indicate ±SE, and n=11–18.To determine whether the effect of cadaverine on root length was due to reduced cell elongation or division, the length of the epidermal cells in the mature root zone of Ler seedlings grown on media containing 0 μM or 100 μM cadaverine was measured. It was found that although Ler roots were only ~35% as long on this concentration of cadaverine as on control medium (Fig. 1A), the average cell length of the seedlings on the medium containing cadaverine was ~64% of that of seedlings on control medium (Fig. 1C). This suggests that the reduction in root length is probably due to a combination of reduced cell elongation and division.A QTL on chromosome 1 affects root length responses to cadaverine Due to the large difference between Cvi and Ler in root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine, a QTL study was performed with a group of RILs created from the two accessions. Other pairs of accessions would have been equally interesting to use for QTL analysis but, at the time this experiment was initiated, the Cvi×Ler population was the available population created from accessions with the most differing cadaverine responses. These RILs were previously characterized for genotypic contribution from the two parental lines along the five chromosomes (Alonso-Blanco et al., 1998). For both the parental lines and the RILs, root growth on medium containing cadaverine compared with growth on control plates lacking this compound was quantified. RIL mean root length ratios showed transgression with respect to the parental means (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, growth on 0 μM and 50 μM cadaverine displayed broad sense heritability values of 0.46 and 0.56, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that this population is well suited for QTL mapping of root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab QTL analysis of root length responses to cadaverine in the Cvi/Ler RIL population. (A) Histogram showing root length ratios for the RILs on 100 μM cadaverine compared with control medium. (B) Composite interval mapping analysis for the root length ratio. The top portion of the graph gives the LOD score across each chromosome. The LOD significance threshold is shown as a horizontal line across the graph. The bottom graph shows the additive value toward the phenotype of each genomic region with respect to the Ler allele. (C) Two-dimensional QTL scan for the root length ratio from trial 1. The x- and y-axes represent positions along each chromosome. The region of the plot below the diagonal gives the additive QTL model, while the region above the diagonal shows epistatic interactions. A scale relating colour to LOD score is provided on the right of the heat map. Numbers on the left of this scale represent LOD scores for the epistatic portion of the plot, whereas those on the right represent scores for the additive model. The arrows indicate the significance thresholds for the epistatic (left) and additive (right) portions of the plot.Using both composite interval mapping and a 2D scan approach, a strong QTL for relative root growth response to cadaverine was identified at the end of chromosome 1 in two independent trials (Fig. 2B). The additive portion of the QTL graph (Fig. 2B, bottom) predicts that having a Ler allele at this location results in a shorter root upon cadaverine treatment compared with a Cvi allele. No epistasis was observed between this QTL and other parts of the genome (Fig. 2C).Near isogenic lines confirm the chromosome 1 QTL Six NILs with Cvi introgression of varying segments of chromosome 1 within an otherwise Ler background (Keurentjes et al., 2007) were used to confirm the root length QTL. The four LCN1 lines that contain a Cvi introgression at the end of chromosome 1 showed greater, more Cvi-like resistance to cadaverine than LCN1-12 and LCN1-22, the NILs that do not contain a Cvi introgression in this region (Fig. 3). The Ler to Cvi breakpoints in these lines were fine-mapped, and the candidate region was narrowed to a 5.3Mb interval at the end of chromosome 1 (primers shown in Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Cadaverine root length responses of chromosome 1 NILs and fine mapping. Relative root lengths on media containing 0, 100, and 500 μM cadaverine are shown. Plants were grown at a 30 ° backward tilt for 6 d. The average root length on control medium was set to 1. Absolute average root lengths on control medium were 1.0, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.1, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.1cm in the lines as shown from left to right. The asterisk indicates the first concentration on which the root length was significantly different from the length on control medium (P<0.05, Student’s t-test). Error bars indicate ±SE, and n=18–34. In the diagram of chromosome 1 NILs (bottom), white bars are Ler chromosomal regions, black bars are Cvi regions, and grey bars indicate regions in which the breakpoint is undetermined. The parallel dashed lines flank the probable region of a locus controlling root length responses to cadaverine. Accession breakpoints were determined using primers based on polymorphisms described by Monsanto/CEREON between Columbia and Ler (Jander et al., 2002).Identification of candidate genes for the chromosome 1 QTL Because many of the causative loci behind the QTL are due to differences in gene expression (Alonso-Blanco et al., 2009), gene expression differences between Cvi and Ler were examined in the candidate region using previously published microarray data (Vaughn and Masson, 2011). The primary data are publicly available at Gene Expression Omnibus (; accession number GSE28275). From these arrays, 19 probe sets representing genes located in the candidate chromosomal segment give hybridization signals that differ significantly (95% confidence interval) by ≥2-fold between Cvi and Ler (Table 1). The largest predicted differentially expressed gene in this region was OCT1, which was estimated to show a 73-fold increase in Cvi compared with Ler. Table 1.

Genes encoding a transglutaminase (At1g69820) and a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (At1g72680), both possibly linked to the formation of polyamine conjugates (Serafini-Fracassini and Del Duca, 2008; Fellenberg et al., 2009), are found in this QTL interval; however, they do not show ≥2-fold expression differences between Cvi and Ler. OCT1 from Cvi and Ler genomic DNA was sequenced. No large insertions or deletions were found, and only one amino acid change was found: residue 431 in the second exon is serine in Cvi and alanine in Ler (Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). Analysing the 2kb of sequence upstream of the start codon revealed numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions but no large insertions or deletions (Supplementary Table S2). Based on these data, it was hypothesized that OCT1 expression differences contribute to root length responses to exogenous cadaverine. qRT-PCR data confirmed the microarray result and showed that OCT1 expression was ~14 times as high in Cvi roots as in Ler roots (Fig. 4). Cadaverine treatment did not significantly change OCT1 expression in either accession (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab OCT1 expression relative to the reference gene At1G58050 is higher in Cvi roots than in Ler roots. Seedlings were grown on 0 μM or 50 μM cadaverine. Error bars indicate ±SE among biological replicates, and OCT1 expression for Ler on control medium was set to 1. The asterisk indicates a significant difference in expression compared with Ler for the given condition (P<0.05, Student’s t-test). Differences within each accession between cadaverine treatments are not significant. oct1-1 mutants express a truncated OCT1 transcript To evaluate a role for OCT1 in root length responses to cadaverine, the oct1-1 mutant, which was previously found to carry a single T-DNA insertion near the 3’ end of the gene, was obtained; both ends of the insertion were characterized (Lelandais-Brière et al., 2007). This mutant was also reported to not express any OCT1 RNA, as determined by RT–PCR using primers aligning on each side of the intron (Lelandais-Brière et al., 2007). To confirm this result, RT–PCR was performed on oct1-1 and (Wassilewskija) WS wild-type root RNA samples. As expected, PCR products were obtained from WS wild-type cDNA samples of the expected sizes using multiple primer sets (1F/1R, 2F/2R, and 3F/3R) (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). Also, no transcript was observed for oct1-1 mutants using primer sets near the 3′ end of the gene (2F/2R, 3F/3R, and 2F/4R) (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, it was found that oct1-1 plants do express a partial OCT1 transcript using primers on each side of the intron (1F/1R) (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). This product size corresponds to approximately the predicted length if the intron is not spliced out of the RNA (238 bases instead of 135 bases), which would result in a premature stop codon in the intron. No product for any primer set was detected in control reactions without reverse transcriptase, which confirms the lack of genomic DNA contamination (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, oct1-1 produces a truncated OCT1 transcript that is highly unlikely to encode a functional protein. oct1-1 shows increased cadaverine sensitivity If Ler roots have higher sensitivity to cadaverine compared with Cvi roots because they have lower OCT1 expression, then oct1 mutant roots should also respond more strongly to cadaverine than wild-type plants. To test this, WS wild type, oct1-1, and two independent transgenic rescue lines (oct1-1 [35Spro:OCT1WS]) were grown on control medium and medium supplemented with cadaverine. Rescue line 1 had significantly higher OCT1 expression compared with the WS wild type, whereas rescue line 2 had a similar level of OCT1 expression (Fig. 5A). It was found that all of these plants had the same root length on control medium lacking cadaverine, but oct1-1 mutant roots were significantly shorter than wild-type roots on media containing 50 μM and 500 μM cadaverine (Fig. 5B). Robust root growth on medium containing cadaverine was restored in both independent transgenic rescue lines. Rescue line 2 showed a wild-type-like response to cadaverine, and rescue line 1 showed increased resistance to cadaverine (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that reduced OCT1 expression confers increased cadaverine sensitivity. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab oct1-1 roots are more sensitive to exogenous cadaverine compared with wild-type plants but respond similarly to putrescine-derived polyamines. (A) OCT1 expression relative to the reference gene At1G58050 is shown. Error bars indicate ±SE among biological replicates, and OCT1 expression for the WS wild type on control medium was set to 1. The asterisk indicates a significant difference in expression compared with the WS wild type (P<0.05, Student’s t-test). The abbreviation n.d. indicates that expression was not detected. (B) Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 ° backward tilt on media containing 0, 50, and 500 μM cadaverine. Root tips were marked after 3 d of growth, and the root growth over the following 3 d was measured for each treatment. Average root growth over the final 3 d on control medium was 1.2cm for the wild type, 1.4cm for oct1-1, 1.3cm for rescue line 1, and 1.4cm for rescue line 2; these lengths were set to 1. For each cadaverine concentration, the letters indicate significant differences in relative root length (P<0.01, pairwise Student’s t-tests). n=37–68, and error bars indicate ±SE. (C) Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 ° backward tilt on media containing various concentrations of polyamines as indicated. Average root length on control medium was 1.3cm for the wild type and 1.4cm for oct1-1; these lengths were set to 1. n=33–44, and error bars indicate ±SE. No significant root length differences were observed for any treatment other than cadaverine (P<0.05, Student’s t-test).The WS wild type and oct1-1 had similar root lengths on media containing the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (Fig. 5C), which shows that this sensitivity is specific to cadaverine. Polyamines have been shown to shorten root growth through the generation of H2O2 by diamine and polyamine oxidases, which promotes premature cell differentiation and programmed cell death (Tisi et al., 2011). However, because the cadaverine-hypersensitive response of oct1-1 was specific to cadaverine (Fig. 5C), OCT1 probably functions in a different aspect of polyamine-mediated root growth regulation.The expression level of OCT1, not its accession origin, correlates with cadaverine sensitivity To determine if differences in the OCT1 sequence between Cvi and Ler or only OCT1 expression levels correlated with the cadaverine response, OCT1 was cloned from Cvi and Ler, and these constructs were introduced into oct1-1 mutants. These transgenic lines were then tested on media containing 0 μM and 50 μM cadaverine, and their relative root lengths were measured. A range of cadaverine resistance levels that did not correlate with the accession source of the transgene was found (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Higher OCT1 expression correlates with cadaverine resistance. OCT1Cvi and OCT1Ler indicate oct1-1 [OCT1pro:OCT1Cvi] and oct1-1 [OCT1pro:OCT1Ler], respectively. (A) Relative root lengths of plants on media containing 0 μM and 50 μM cadaverine. Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 ° backward tilt. Average root length on control medium was set to 1. Absolute average root length on control medium was 2.2cm for Cvi, 1.9cm for Ler, 2.0cm for WS, 2.0cm for oct1-1, and 1.9, 2.0, 1.7, and 2.1cm for the transgenic lines as shown from left to right. Error bars indicate ±SE, and n=17–24. (B) Root OCT1 expression determined by qRT-PCR is shown relative to the reference gene At1G58050. OCT1 expression in Ler was set to 1. Error bars indicate ±SE among the biological replicates. The abbreviation n.d. indicates that expression was not detected.Because the insertion location can affect transgene expression, it was predicted that the OCT1 expression levels would correlate with cadaverine sensitivity. To test this, OCT1 expression was measured in four of these lines by qRT-PCR. As expected, a range of OCT1 expression levels was found in the transgenic lines regardless of whether the OCT1 untranslated and coding regions came from Cvi or Ler. In general, lines with increased resistance to cadaverine had higher OCT1 expression (Fig. 6).Genes other than OCT1 probably also contribute to the cadaverine response The data suggest that differences in OCT1 expression contribute significantly to the different cadaverine root length responses in Cvi and Ler. To determine if differences in OCT1 expression among other natural accessions also correlate with variability in cadaverine sensitivity, OCT1 expression was measured in two other accessions, one resistant to cadaverine (Knox-18) and one sensitive to cadaverine (Sq-8). It was found that both lines had higher OCT1 expression than Ler even though only Knox-18 was more resistant to cadaverine than Ler. Furthermore, Sq-8 displayed higher OCT1 expression than Knox-18 despite being more sensitive to cadaverine (Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online). The OCT1 sequences of the eight natural accessions initially selected for the analysis of cadaverine response were also compared. Polymorphisms shared among the three most resistant accessions (Cvi-1, Knox-18, and Ull2-3) or the three most sensitive accessions (An-1, Ler-2, and Sq-8) were not seen (Supplementary Table S2). Together, these data suggest that factors other than OCT1 expression may also contribute significantly to differential cadaverine sensitivity among these accessions. Ectopic copies of OCT1 derived from Cvi or Ler were also introduced into Columbia and Ler wild-type plants. Ler root length is highly sensitive to cadaverine, whereas Columbia root length is less sensitive to it. In general, the Columbia plants showed a range of responses to cadaverine regardless of the accession from which the transgene was derived (Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online). This result is similar to that obtained when these constructs were transformed into the oct1-1 mutant (Fig. 6). In contrast, when these constructs were transformed into Ler plants, the tested lines generally did not show increased resistance to cadaverine (Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, the ability of OCT1 to affect the cadaverine response may depend on the genetic background.Discussion It was found that Arabidopsis roots exhibited varying responses to exogenously applied cadaverine depending on the accession. In general, when cadaverine concentrations increased, a reduction in root length as well as alterations in skewing, lateral root branching, and root waving were seen. The reduction in root length is probably due to a combination of reduced cell division and expansion. A major QTL was identified on chromosome 1 that at least partially explains the root length difference in response to cadaverine between Cvi and Ler. By comparing phenotypes and gene expression in natural accessions, a mutant, and transgenic lines, OCT1 was identified as a key gene involved in this response. Restoring OCT1 expression in the mutant background resulted in a positive correlation between OCT1 expression levels and cadaverine resistance. Because the OCT1 expression levels in other natural accessions do not correlate well with cadaverine resistance, other genes are also likely to contribute to the variation of this trait between Arabidopsis accessions. These genes could contribute to endogenous cadaverine homeostasis, transport, and/or response. Unfortunately, the levels of endogenous cadaverine in Arabidopsis seedling roots and shoots were below the level of detection using HPLC methods, preventing a distinction from being made between these possibilities. OCT1 encodes an organic cation transporter. In animals, OCT proteins take up a wide variety of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, and, therefore, they affect substrate absorption, distribution, and excretion in many tissues. Most are polyspecific, and transport can occur in either direction (for a review, see Roth et al., 2012). Arabidopsis OCT1 is one of six OCT-like proteins in Arabidopsis (Lelandais-Brière et al., 2007). It was previously reported to localize to the plasma membrane, and promoter–β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusions showed activity in the vasculature of many organs including roots (Lelandais-Brière et al., 2007; Küfner and Koch, 2008). Because the other six OCT-like proteins localize to the tonoplast rather than the plasma membrane, it is likely that OCT1 has a different function. The present work expands on these studies and suggests a role for OCT1 in affecting root growth responses to cadaverine. Future experiments will be aimed at clarifying the mechanism by which this occurs. One possibility is that OCT1 transports cadaverine away from elongating root cells and through the vasculature, causing it to accumulate in aerial tissues. Alternatively, cadaverine may alter the transport of another molecule through the membranes. Polyamines block many kinds of channels in multiple organisms. For example, spermine and spermidine directly block fast vacuolar cation channels in barley (Bruggemann et al., 1998), and all natural polyamines including cadaverine can regulate cation channel activity through cytoplasmic pathways (Liu et al., 2000; Shabala et al., 2007). It has been demonstrated that exogenous cadaverine affects Arabidopsis root morphology and that there is natural variation in this response due in part to varying expression levels of OCT1. This work has potential implications for better understanding how polyamines contribute to development and mediate stress responses.Supplementary data Supplementary data are available at JXB online.

    "abstract": "Abstract We evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), on the structure of both micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm; species composition and abundance) and cytometric populations (photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which included prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk); and bacterioplankton (HB), heterotrophic bacteria), using a microcosms-based approach and a single 7-day exposure. Assays were performed on two different microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two contrasting turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll a = 7.6 μgL-1, turbidity = 1 NTU) and organic turbid systems (chlorophyll a = 25.0 μgL-1, turbidity = 9 NTU). For each system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i.L−1. The impact of AsiMax 50® seemed to be greater in the turbid system. In this system, total abundance of living (live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and organic turbid systems, micro + nano phytoplankton decreased in species richness and abundance at higher herbicide concentrations. These results suggest that 2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as Ochromonas sp. and Chlamydomonas sp., showed different responses to herbicide exposure between water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation. However, caution must be taken when extrapolating these effects to real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm experiment.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction With the advent of genetically modified crops and the introduction of no-till methods, herbicides have become the “stars” of the chemicals used in industrial agriculture. Currently, glyphosate-based herbicides, whose main mode of action is through the disruption of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis (Amrhein et al., 1980), are used worldwide, while other herbicides are applied as complementary tools for weed control. Herbicides have several different modes of action (Peterson et al., 2015). Auxinic herbicides, which belong to a chemical family largely used in agriculture, mimic the biphasic effects of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which is the principal natural auxin in higher plants. It usually stimulates growth by cell division and elongation when targeted to cell sites of action at low concentration (Grossmann, 2010). Auxin-derived herbicides such as phenoxy hormone products were used in an average of 22,916 tons worldwide between 1990-2002. The use of these herbicides was reported to increase an average of 30,436 tons of active ingredients between 2003-2014 (FAOSTAT, 2018). After more than 2 decades of glyphosate massive spraying in Argentina, the use of herbicides such as 2,4-D, paraquat and dicamba has sky-rocketed in the last years to prevent the spread of glyphosate resistance in target weeds. The 2,4-D was the third most imported herbicide into Argentina between 2013 and 2015 (SENASA, 2018), and now it is considered one of the most used agrochemicals worldwide (Singh and Singh, 2016). Moreover, plants genetically modified to tolerate different herbicides, including 2,4-D, were recently approved for commercial production in Argentina (CONABIA, 2019). Under this scenario, 2,4-D application rates are expected to increase in Argentina. The 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is an auxin-type selective herbicide that induces overgrowth of vascular cambium in dicotyledonous, ultimately leading to death (Song, 2014). After application, it is transformed by bacterial metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Singh and Singh, 2016). The persistence of 2,4-D in the environment depends on the availability of other carbon sources involved in microbial metabolism, its half-life being between 20 and 312 days (Islam et al., 2018). Build-up of 2,4-D residues may cause important alterations in soil and aquatic ecosystems. The 2,4-D can produce disruptive effects in fungi (Bernat et al., 2018), insects (Sharma et al., 2018), amphibians (LaChapelle et al., 2007; Aronzon et al., 2011; Van Meter et al., 2018), fish (Dehnert et al., 2018; De Arcaute et al., 2018), and others (Islam et a. 2018). Other studies reported the effect of pure 2,4-D on microbial communities (Kobraei and White, 1996; Aguayo et al., 2014; Lozano et al., 2018), but little is known about the collateral impact of commercial formulations of this herbicide on wild biota in agricultural landscapes. These commercial formulations consist of the active ingredient (2,4-D), water and inert elements such as solvents, surfactants and humectants of unknown composition which increase plant cuticle permeability to 2,4-D (Lanctôt et al., 2014). The 2,4-D has different effects according to its concentration: low concentrations stimulate the growth of some phytoplanktonic species, whereas high concentrations inhibit their development (Boyle, 1980; Kobraei and White, 1996; Wong, 2000). In regard to other freshwater communities, De Lipthay et al. (2003) reported that low concentrations of the active ingredient (a.i.) (<40 μg L−1) modify the structure of the bacterial community from a shallow aquifer, leading to an increase in 2,4-D degrading bacteria. In addition, an increase in Actinobacteria growth was detected at 20 mg L−1 of 2,4-D in an oligotrophic lake (Aguayo et al., 2014), which resulted from the ability of Arthrobacter sp. to use 2,4-D and other aromatic compounds as sources of carbon and energy (Sandmann and Loos, 1988; Westerberg et al., 2000). It is well known that freshwater systems become contaminated either by direct spraying over water or indirectly via soil drift (Ensminger et al., 2013; Aparicio et al., 2015; Berman et al., 2018; Metcalfe et al., 2019). Algae and cyanobacteria from lakes, ponds and rivers share several metabolic pathways with vascular plants, suggesting that they can be similarly affected by herbicides (Ferrari et al., 2018). Indeed, these organisms have shown to be severely altered, mainly at the population level (Vera et al., 2010, 2012; Lipok et al., 2010; Pérez et al., 2011; Qiu et al., 2013; Pizarro et al., 2016). They are important in freshwater ecosystems because of their role as main primary producers, either as free-living planktonic organisms or attached to diverse substrata (phyto-periphyton fraction). Taking into account the important ecosystem services supplied by freshwater systems, there is increasing concern about the deleterious effect of herbicides, as previously demonstrated for glyphosate (Pérez et al., 2007). There are more than 10,000 shallow lakes in the Pampa plain of Argentina (Dukatz et al., 2006), which is one of the most affected regions by agricultural activities worldwide. These water bodies switch between two alternative stable states with contrasting typologies (Scheffer et al., 1993): clear-water lakes with very low phytoplankton abundance and turbid ones dominated by phytoplankton. Both states show different phytoplankton populations, as they are adapted to distinct nutrient and light conditions (Allende et al., 2009). In last decades, however, there are some evidences indicating that lakes remain turbid due to agrochemical contamination (Quirós et al., 2002; Vera et al., 2010). In this work we evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D, on the structure of freshwater microbial communities under different exposure conditions using microcosms. The assays were carried out with two different consolidated microbial assemblages. One of these was sampled from a clear freshwater system and the other from a turbid freshwater system. We analyzed the quali- and quantitative composition of micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm) and photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which includes prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk). Bacterioplankton (HB, heterotrophic bacteria) was also considered in the analysis}. All the microbial communities were exposed to a wide range of concentrations of the active ingredient for 7 d. We tested the following hypotheses: 1- the impact of AsiMax 50® depends on water turbidity, which results from the different structure of the microbial communities; and 2- the impact of AsiMax 50® depends on the 2,4-D concentration used.",
    "methods": "2. Methods We performed a manipulative laboratory experiment with 48 microcosms, each of which consisted of a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask filled with water (experimental unit = e.u.), taken from two outdoor water systems of contrasting turbidity status. Of these, 24 were filled with clear water (thereafter referred to as clear) and 24 with organic turbid water (thereafter referred to as turbid). The initial conditions of water samples were: chlorophyll a = 7.6 μg L−1, turbidity = 1 NTU for clear and chlorophyll a = 25.0 μg L−1, turbidity = 9 NTU for turbid. These environmental variables are usually used to characterize the shallow lakes typical of the Pampa plain from Argentina (Allende et al., 2009). Microcosms were randomly placed in a shaking chamber set at 25 °C and 12:12 L:D photoperiod during the entire exposure to AsiMax 50®. After a microcosm stabilization period of 3 days, the experiment started with the addition of 2,4-D as commercial formulation of AsiMax 50®, randomly applied in triplicate, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i. L−1 to clear and turbid microcosms. The sampling scheme was as follows: a) samples were taken from 3 e.u. at zero time (T0, before addition of AsiMax 50®) to determine the initial conditions of physical and chemical parameters and micro + nanophytoplankton; b) samples were taken from all treatments after 7d (Tf, final time) to determine treatment effect; c) considering the time scale at which populations of very small organisms react to an impact (Peck, 2011), samples of PPP and HB were taken after 15 min (T1) and 7 d (Tf) of 2,4-D addition (n = 24 for both groups). 2.1. Physical and chemical parameters The real concentrations of 2,4-D were measured from water samples collected from all the e.u. and kept at -20 °C for further processing. For 2,4-D determination, samples were unfrozen, homogenized and diluted 1:10 with Milli-Q water. Finally, the samples were collected in 2-mL glass vials and the analysis was performed using HPLC-UV technique coupled with UV detector at 232 nm (APHA, 2005). Turbidity was measured with a portable turbidimeter (Hach® 2100 P). 2.2. Biological variables 2.2.1. Chlorophyll a concentration For chlorophyll a determination, 200-mL water samples were filtered through Whatman® GF/F filters and stored at -20 °C. Chlorophyll a concentration values were obtained by spectrophotometric absorbance, using acetone as solvent. Absorbances were read at 665 and 750 nm, before and after acidification with HCl 1 N. Before reading, samples were first left overnight in the solvent and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm. Concentration values were obtained following Lilchtenthaler and Wellburn (1983).2.2.2. Micro and nano-phytoplankton (2–200 μm) A 200-mL water sample from each e.u. was fixed with acidified Lugol's iodine solution and kept at 4 °C for subsequent phytoplankton (˃2 μm) counts. These were made according to Utermöhl's technique (Utermöhl, 1958) to the lowest taxonomic level, distinguishing between live and dead organisms. Individuals were considered to be alive when they had an organized cell structure with undamaged chloroplasts and cell wall (e.g. frustules for diatoms), among other structures. A maximum counting error of 20% was accepted for the most abundant taxa (Venrick, 1978).2.2.3. PPP and HB populations (<2 μm) Picoplankton, which comprised different PPP populations, and HB were analyzed using a FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson®) flow cytometer equipped with a standard 15 mW blue argon-ion (488 nm emission) laser and a red laser diode (635 nm). Samples (3.6 mL) were fixed with 10% cold glutaraldehyde (1% final concentration), left in the dark for 10 min at room temperature and then stored at -80 °C. Two subsamples were taken for separate counts of HB and PPP. For HB, 400-μl samples were stained with SYBRGreen I (Sigma Aldrich®) diluted in DMSO to a final concentration of 1X, left for about 10 min in the dark to complete the nucleic-acid staining and run in the flow cytometer. A known volume of beads (1-μm diameter, Fluospheres®) was added to unfrozen samples. HB were detected by their signature in plots of side scatter light (SSC) versus green fluorescence of nucleic acid-bound stains FITC (FL1 530 nm) and SSC (side scatter) axes (e.g. Gasol et al., 1999). Turbid samples were previously diluted with pre-filtered PBS (1:10). For PPP we used the same procedure as for HB, but without stain addition. Picoplanktonic algae were identified in plots of SSC versus blue laser-dependent red fluorescence (PerCP or FL3, 670 nm), orange fluorescence (PE or FL2 585/42 nm) versus FL3, and red laser-dependent far-red fluorescence (APC or FL4, 661 nm) versus FL3.2.2.4. Analysis of the contribution of autotrophic fractions to total autotrophic biomass To compare the contribution of micro + nanophytoplankton and PPP populations to the autotrophic biomass at Tf, the biovolume of each size fraction was calculated for control and herbicide treatments for clear and turbid systems at Tf. The biovolume of micro + nano phytoplankton was calculated following Rott (1981) and Hillebrand et al. (1999). In regard to PPP, a sphere with a theoretical size of 0.9 μm was considered for PE-Pcy, PC-Pcy and PEuk, which represents a theoretical biovolume three times higher than that of Pcy (Callieri, 2008). 2.3. Statistical and numerical analysis The homogeneity of the e.u. was verified in terms of water turbidity, for both turbid and clear systems, just before the addition of AsiMax 50® by a Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric ANOVA by ranks test (KW). Statistical differences in turbidity, chlorophyll a concentration and abundance of micro + nano phytoplankton between turbidity states were analyzed at Tf using one-way ANOVA (factor treatment = control and six AsiMax 50® concentration levels). Multiple comparisons were carried out using Tukey test. The Holm-Sidak method was used to compare treated and control groups. RM-ANOVA was applied for testing the significance of PPP and HB counts, with two factors: time (T1 and Tf) and treatment (control and six AsiMax 50® concentration levels). For nano + micro phytoplankton, a Pearson correlation matrix was calculated among the abundances of live organisms of species from all treatments, for each type of system. Species that were recorded more than five times in all samples and in at least two e.u. of the same treatment, were included in the analysis. These matrices were incorporated into Cytoscape® v 3.7.1 software (Shannon et al., 2003) to build networks among species. In addition, the following indices were calculated (Magurran, 2013): richness (S); the Simpson index as 1-D, where D = ∑(ni(ni−1)N(N−1)), ni is the number of organisms of the ith species and N is the total number of organisms; and evenness E= (1/D)/S).",

Under the clear condition and considering T0 and Tf, this group made up 71% of the total micro + nanoplankton abundance, followed by Dinophyceae (12.1%), Bacillariophyceae (8.86%), Crysophyceae (7.8%) and Cryptophyceae (0.2%). At T0, Chlorophyta represented 38.8% of the total abundance of the micro + nano planktonic fraction. At Tf, this group showed significant increases in abundance between the AsiMax 50® treatments and the control (ANOVA, p˂0.001), except for 2,000 mg L−1, where the percentages of all groups were similar to those at T0 (Fig. 2A). In the turbid system, Chlorophyta dominated in richness and abundance, followed by Crysophyceae (1.2%), Cyanobacteria (0.8%) and Dinophyceae (0.6%). At T0, Chlorophyta made up 95.7% of the total abundance, and a significant increase was observed at Tf (ANOVA p = 0.046), with a mean value of 97.7% for all treatments (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab A-B. Abundance percentages of micro + nanophytoplanktonic groups at T0 (control) and Tf (control and 2,4-D concentrations) for clear and turbid systems.In the clear system, mean total abundance of micro + nano plankton at T0 was 2,324 ± 352 individuals (ind) mL−1, with 61.5% of live organisms (Fig. 3A). At Tf, mean total abundance for the control was ∼5 times greater than that at T0 (ANOVA, p = 0.003) while no AsiMax 50® effect was found on total abundance. In the turbid system, mean total abundance of micro + nano plankton at T0 was 663,603 ± 40,174 ind mL−1 (mean ± SD), with 90.2% of live organisms (Fig. 3B). At Tf, no significant change was recorded for the control between T0 and Tf. Moreover, the 0.02, 0.2, 2 and 20 mg L−1 treatments led to a significant increase in the total abundance compared to control (ANOVA, p < 0.001, p = 0.003, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). On the other hand, the 200 and 2000 mg L−1 treatments did not differ significantly in total live abundances with respect to control. For both clear and turbid systems, data of the abundance of live organisms at Tf were fitted to second-order polynomial curves from all the herbicide treatments (Figs. 3 A and B). Better fit to a humped-shaped curve was found for the turbid (R2 = 0.64) compared with the clear (R2 = 0.41) system. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab A-D.

(*) Significant differences with respect to control (p < 0.05).The values of total live abundance of micro + nano plankton mentioned above were in agreement with the variations in abundance of the most abundant species for each type of system. In the clear system, Choricystis sp. was the dominant taxon in all treatments, followed by Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp. At Tf, the live abundance of Choricystis sp. showed a significant decrease with respect to control (ANOVA, p = 0.047), with a significant increase in dead abundance (ANOVA, p˂0.001) (Fig. 3C). Moreover, at Tf a significant increase in dead abundance was found for Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp. in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment (ANOVA, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). In the turbid system, Staurastrum sp. showed the highest value of live abundance, with significant increments in the 0.02, 0.2, 2 and 20 mg L−1 treatments (Fig. 3D). A significant increase in dead abundance was found in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment (ANOVA, p<0.001). This species was followed in live abundance by Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp., whose live and dead abundances did not show any clear trend due to herbicide input (Fig. 3D). In summary, in the clear system the micro + nanoplanktonic fraction showed the largest difference in composition between control and the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment, while in the turbid system its quali- and quantitative composition in the 200 and 2,000 mg L−1 treatments was similar to that in the control. Correlation networks of live abundance were constructed for micro + nanoplanktonic species to analyze the relationships among taxa exposed to AsiMax 50® under clear and turbid conditions (Fig. 4). The networks included 10 and 7 species for the clear and turbid systems, respectively. Taxa were more significantly and positively intercorrelated in the turbid (mean r = 0.62) than in the clear system (mean r = 0.56). As already mentioned, some species were present in both systems (i.e. Chlamydomonas sp., Staurastrum sp., Ochromonas sp., Tetraedron minimum and Peridinium sp.). However, they responded differently to the herbicide depending on the system. Chlamydomonas sp. was negatively affected in the clear system but not in the turbid one (Fig. 3C). According to the correlation network, the abundance of Chlamydomonas sp. was significantly and positively correlated with the most abundant species, Staurastrum sp. (r Pearson = 0.60; p = 0.002) (Fig. 4). In the clear system, no-significant correlation was observed between the abundances of Chlamydomonas sp. and of any of the species significantly stimulated by the herbicide. In the turbid system, Staurastrum sp. was the species most strongly stimulated by AsiMax 50® (Fig. 3C) and the most correlated with the subdominant taxa (Fig. 4). This trend was not observed in the clear system, where the abundance of Staurastrum sp. was not correlated with that of any other species. The abundance of Ochromonas sp. also varied depending on the type of system, i.e. its abundance decreased in the clear system, while it increased at low 2,4-D concentrations and decreased at higher concentrations in the turbid one (Fig. 3C). The abundance of this species was significantly and positively correlated with that of Staurastrum sp. (r Pearson = 0.72; p = 0.0001), while it was not significantly correlated with that of any other species in the clear system (Fig. 4). Fig. 4.

Networks were built with Cytoscape® v3.7.1 software.At T0, mean values of richness, diversity and evenness were higher in the clear system (S = 7.00 ± 1.00, D = 0.74 ± 0.03 and E = 0.57 ± 0.14) than in the turbid one (S = 6.67 ± 0.58, D = 0.14 ± 0.03 and E = 0.17 ± 0.01. In general, at Tf, these parameters showed no significant differences between herbicide treatments and control for both types of systems, except for the following: (a) for the clear system, a significant decrease in D (ANOVA, p = 0.04) was observed in the 200 mg L−1 treatment with respect to control, with D = 0.29 ± 0.13; (b) for the turbid system, S and E decreased significantly in the 200 mg L−1 treatment, with S = 3.67 ± 0.58 (ANOVA, p = 0.006) and E = 0.29 ± 0.05 (ANOVA p = 0.041); and in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment, with S = 3.00 ± 1.00 (ANOVA p˂0.001) and E = 0.38 ± 0.12 (ANOVA, p = 0.001).3.2.3. Cytometric populations (0.2–2 μm): PPP and HB Cytograms of samples of control and herbicide treatments collected at T1 and Tf revealed four cytometric populations, of which one corresponded to HB, and the other three to photosynthetic populations: PEuk, PC-Pcy and PE-Pcy. The HB was more abundant than PPP, both in the clear and turbid systems, ranging between a maximum of 99.7% (clear, Tf, 2,000 mg L−1) and a minimum of 80.9% (turbid, Tf, 2,000 mg L−1) (Table 3). RM-ANOVA revealed significant differences in the abundance of HB and PPP between T1 and Tf for the clear and turbid systems (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.018 and p = 0.001 respectively). In regard to treatment effects, PPP showed significant variations in abundance at 2,000 mg L−1 of 2,4-D with a rapid significant increment of ∼5 times at T1 compared to control (RM-ANOVA, p < 0.001 in both systems, Table 3). This increase continued until Tf in the turbid system, while it did not in the clear one (RM-ANOVA, p < 0.001). The same increase in abundance was observed in the 200 mg L−1 treatment (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.003) for the turbid system at Tf. The abundance of the HB fraction was significantly increased by ∼3 times at Tf in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment only for the clear system (ANOVA, p<0.001). Table 3.

PE-Pcy was the best represented group of the PPP populations, ranging from 53.8% (Tf, 20 mg L−1) to 99.2% (T1, 2,000 mg L−1) for the clear system and from 96.0% (Tf, 0.2 mg L−1) to 99.0% (Tf, 2,000 mg L−1) for the turbid system (Fig. 5). For the clear system at T1, PEuk abundance ranged between a minimum of 856 ± 202 ind mL−1 (200 mg L−1) to a maximum of 1,284 ± 466 ind mL−1 (2,000 mg mL−1), with no significant differences among treatments (Fig. 6A). At Tf, PEuk abundance ranged from 509 ± 111 ind mL−1 (2,000 mg L−1) to 9,118 ± 2,268 ind mL−1 (control). RM-ANOVA analysis showed no significant growth of PEuk in microcosms treated with 2,000 mg L−1 (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.580), while this population showed a significant growth response in the rest of the treatments, including controls. Such growth inhibition at 2,000 mg L−1 led to a significant decrease in PEuk abundance of ∼18 times at Tf, compared to control (ANOVA, p˂0.001) (Fig. 6A). In the turbid system at T1, PEuk abundance ranged from 6,621 ± 368 ind mL−1 (0.02 mg L−1) to 39,887 ± 11,842 ind mL−1 (2,000 mg L−1). At this time, a significant increment of ∼5 times compared to control was measured in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment (ANOVA, p˂0.001) (Fig. 6B). At Tf, the abundance of this fraction ranged from 2,950 ± 223 (20 mg L−1) to 10,979 ± 4,271 (2,000 mg L−1), with no significant differences between treatments and control. The abundance of this population decreased significantly between T1 and Tf for the 200 and 2,000 mg L−1 treatments (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.026 and p<0.001 respectively), resulting from an early growth and a subsequent decrease.

In the turbid system, its abundance ranged from 80 ± 77 (0.2 mg L−1) to 206 ± 86 (200 mg L−1) at T1, and from 187 ± 90 (0.2 mg L−1) to 333 ± 207 ind mL−1 (0.02 mg L−1) at Tf (Fig. 6D). No significant effects between treatments were found in any case for this population. PE-Pcy, the most abundant PPP fraction, at T1 ranged from 22,969 ± 2,530 (200 mg L−1) to 164,130 ± 48,443 ind mL−1 (2,000 mg L−1) in the clear system. At this time, a significant increase in PE-Pcy abundance of ∼5 times was observed in relation to control in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment (ANOVA, p˂<0.001) (Fig. 6E). At Tf, there were no significant variations, with a minimum of 15,527 ± 8,418 (0.02 mg L−1) and a maximum of 23,553 ± 4,497 ind mL−1 (control). RM-ANOVA revealed an early increase (at T1) in the abundance of this fraction in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment, with a subsequent decline at Tf (RM-ANOVA, p<0.001). In the turbid system, this fraction ranged from 62,626 ± 44,171 (0.02 mg L−1) to 651,631 ± 68,514 ind L−1 (2,000 mg L−1) at T1 and from 115,508 ± 16,676 (2 mg L−1) to 853,987 ± 230,227 ind L−1 (2,000 mg L−1) at Tf (Fig. 6F). This population showed a significant increase in abundance of ∼4 times at T1, and of ∼5 times at Tf in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment compared to control (ANOVA, p0.001 in both cases). Also, an increase in abundance of ∼3 times was recorded in the 200 mg L−1 treatment (ANOVA, p˂0.001) at Tf for the turbid system (Fig. 6F). These increases persisted between T1 and Tf for the 200 and 2,000 mg L−1 treatments (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.004 and p = 0.017, respectively). At Tf, the percentage contribution of the different size autotrophic fractions to total autotrophic biomass varied among groups (Table 4). For the turbid system, micro + nano phytoplankton showed a lower contribution in the treatments at higher concentrations (200 and 2,000 mg L−1) (ANOVA, p = 0.005 and p<0.001, respectively). This decrease was in accordance with the increase in the percentage contribution of the PE-Pcy fraction at 200 mg L−1 (ANOVA, p = 0.004), as well as with the increase in the percentage contribution of both PE-Pcy (ANOVA, p<0.001) and PEuk (ANOVA, p = 0.002) fractions at 2,000 mg L−1.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion Our results strongly suggest that the degree of water turbidity affects the response of the studied freshwater populations exposed for 7 days to the 2,4-D-based herbicide Asimax 50®. We found differences in the structural integrity of the phytoplankton and picoplankton communities from low to high concentrations of the active ingredient. The impact of AsiMax 50® on micro + nano phytoplankton seemed to be greater in the turbid than in the clear system, in terms of both richness and abundance. An experimental effect of the clear system on this fraction was likely to occur between T0 and Tf, compared to control. This was not observed in the turbid system and may be attributable to a “confinement effect” (Pesce et al., 2009), which takes place after samples collected from a natural system are placed into microcosms of lower volume. At T0, phytoplankton diversity, richness and evenness were higher in the clear than in the turbid system. At Tf, no decrease in phytoplankton richness was observed for any treatment in the clear system, while it decreased significantly at 200 and 2,000 mg L−1 of 2,4-D in the turbid system. This suggests that some species cannot survive at the higher herbicide concentrations, in agreement with that reported for 2,4-D by Kobraei and White (1996). Communities with high levels of diversity tend to be more resilient to environmental changes (Oliver et al., 2015), due to redundancy among different species sharing similar functions. Resilience increases if these species also show differential resistance to a contaminant. Indeed, Girvan et al. (2005) have demonstrated that bacterial diversity in soils promotes community stability and resilience after benzene perturbation. In the case of phytoplankton, it is expected that the differential sensitivity of species to herbicides (Huertas et al., 2010) as well as their presence and relative abundance, will determine the response of the community as a whole. The richer the community, the greater the chance for the presence of tolerant or resistant species to a contaminant, and the response of the community will rely upon the evenness and sensitivity of the dominant species, if any. In general, natural or anthropogenic agents induce a wide range of responses in biological entities, according to their scale of complexity (Peck, 2011). For example, variations in total abundance may reflect different physiological strategies. In our study, phytoplanktonic species that survived at 2,000 mg L−1 of 2,4-D in the clear system and at 200 and 2,000 mg L−1 of 2,4-D in the turbid system showed low abundance values due to decreased reproduction. A similar behavior was observed for phytoplankton exposed to the commercial glyphosate-based formulation RoundUp®, which had no effect on species richness but produced a significant strong decrease in total abundance (Pérez et al., 2007). The abundance of the micro + nano phytoplankton community decreased at higher concentrations and increased at lower concentrations of 2,4-D (0.02; 0.2; 2 and 20 mg L−1), with a humped-shaped, dose-dependent response. This effect was more clearly noted in the turbid than in the clear system. Although we used a commercial formulation with undeclared ingredients to obtain a more realistic approach, stimulation effects on phytoplankton are consistent with those previously reported for the active principle. In this regard, further experiments comparing the effects of pure 2,4-D and AsiMax® are required for a more conclusive assessment. Nevertheless, the stimulation of phytoplankton at low doses of 2,4-D has been already reported in studies involving algal monoculture trials and mesocosms (Boyle, 1980; Kobraei and White, 1996; Wong, 2000). The auxin pathways and their modes of action are well-known for vascular plants, but not for algae (Žižková et al., 2016) and after many years of debate (Lau et al., 2009), the presence of auxin pathways in algae and cyanobacteria was finally confirmed by Sergeeva et al. (2002). Certainly, the fact that 2,4-D induces growth at low doses and causes growth inhibition at higher ones provides evidence that it may mimic hormonal function. Moreover, the presence or absence of auxin pathways in the different species (e.g. Staurastrum sp., dominant in the turbid system) occurring in each community, could be determinant for the whole community response. Žižková et al. (2016) demonstrated that some cyanobacteria and algae that differ taxonomically possess different concentrations of IAA. They found that four species of Chlamydomonales have low IAA concentration, while some Desmidiales, the same group as that of Staurastrum sp., have high IAA concentration. Different sensitivity was observed for Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp. that were present in both kinds of systems. These species tended to decrease in abundance with respect to control in the clear system while they tended to increase in the turbid one. The impact of 2,4-D on the community may not only be direct, according to species sensitivity but also indirect, via the interactions among community members. The differential absorption and/or utilization of the 2,4-D by certain species may indirectly affect the total abundance of others. In our case, it is possible that the intake of 2,4-D by the dominant Staurastrum sp. limited the exposure of other species to the herbicide. In addition, the 2,4-D may indirectly affect the freshwater community through ecological interactions such as competition, facilitation and/or predation. Numerous examples of these indirect effects due to different contaminants can be found in the comprehensive review by Fleeger et al. (2003). In our study, the sensitivity of Chlamydomonas sp. to 2,4-D detected in the clear system was probably masked in the turbid one by Staurastrum sp. growth. A similar process would have occurred for Ochromonas sp. The correlation network analyses suggest that the 2,4-D stimulated the growth of Staurastrum sp. when it was predominant through a putative auxin pathway, and that this allowed the development of other species that are actually sensitive to 2,4-D. In brief, the capacity of Staurastrum sp. to rapidly absorb the contaminant may have decreased the exposure of other species in the turbid system. The fact that Staurastrum sp. occurred in the clear system but in a very low proportion may indicate that not only species composition but also their relative abundance are important to predict the behavior of the system in response to a contaminant. The comparison of the correlation networks indicated that species were less intercorrelated in the clear system than in the turbid one, suggesting greater community stability for the former than for the latter under herbicide stress. In a less stable community, the change in one species affects the other species. The difficulty of determining the processes that control the responses of a given species strongly underlines the need to be cautious when extrapolating results from monospecific assays to realistic field situations. Lozano et al. (2018), who performed a microcosm experiment with the same Staurastrum sp. as used here but collected from a phytoplanktonic community with different structural characteristics, reported that it always decreased in abundance after exposure at different concentrations of 2,4-D in pure form. This suggests that the same species may respond differently to agrochemicals depending, on one hand, on the characteristics of their phytoplankton community and, on the other hand, on the form of the chemical assayed (i.e. pure versus formulation). AsiMax 50® is a commercial formulation based on 2,4-D as active ingredient, with coadjuvants and other substances. The use of active ingredient and/or commercial formulations makes the comparison across assays difficult. The impacts of active ingredients and commercial formulations on freshwater organisms and/or communities have been well documented for different herbicides (Tsui and Chu, 2003; Annett et al., 2014; Lipok et al., 2010; De Stefano et al., 2018). The significant increase in the abundance of HB was only observed at the highest 2,4-D concentration in the clear system, probably because the herbicide acted as a nutrient source for bacterial growth. On the other hand, the HB did not show a significant growth in the turbid system probably because its initial abundance was sufficient to metabolize the herbicide. Pizarro et al. (2016) studied the impact of glyphosate formulation Glifosato Atanor® on microbial communities from clear and organic turbid freshwater systems. In agreement with our study, they found that abundance of bacteria only increased in clear water, most likely because the herbicide was used as nutrient source. The effect of 2,4-D on bacterial communities has been studied by Aguayo et al. (2014), who observed that the phylum Actinobacteria was predominant at 20 mg L−1 of 2,4-D, using water from a cold and pristine oligotrophic lake. Likewise, De Lipthay et al. (2003) reported that a long-term exposure of a subsurface aquifer to a mixture of auxinic herbicides at low concentrations (<40 μg L−1) induced the increment of phenoxy acid-degrading bacteria. The PPP fraction also seemed to experience more pronounced changes in the turbid than in the clear system. It showed a rapid response after 15 min at the highest herbicide concentration in both clear and turbid systems, which was determined by the different behavior of their respective components. This effect was due to a rapid increase in the abundance of PE-Pcy in the clear system and of PEuk and PE-Pcy in the turbid one. The PPP fraction also showed an increase in abundance at the higher herbicide concentrations at Tf in the turbid system. This was mediated by an increase in the PE-Pcy fraction, which was probably stimulated by the combination of direct and indirect effects of AsiMax 50®. The herbicide would act directly on the PE-Pcy fraction if it had auxin pathways, and in this regard Žižková et al. (2016) found that two species of cyanobacteria (Chroococcus minutus and Phormidium animale) contained very high amounts of endogenous auxin (IAA). On the other hand, the decrease in the micro + nano plankton in the same treatments could have indirectly stimulated the growth of PE-Pcy due to decreased competitive pressure. Changes in micro + nano phytoplankton and PPP abundance accounted for changes in chlorophyll a concentration; this is particularly true for the former fraction, which represented more than 99% of the total phytoplanktonic biomass. This phenomenon was more clearly observed in the turbid system, where chlorophyll a concentration followed a similar hump-shaped, dose-dependence pattern as that obtained for micro + nano phytoplankton abundance. Changes in turbidity resembled those in chlorophyll a concentration, especially for the turbid system, where both variables decreased to lower levels. The Pampa Plain in Argentina has plenty of permanent shallow lakes with contrasting water turbidity and phytoplankton biomass. It is one of the principal agricultural regions worldwide, where millions of liters of agrochemicals are used each year. The present investigation provides new evidence on the mode of action of the 2,4-D-based herbicide Asimax 50® in freshwater, which is one of the most frequently used commercial formulations in agricultural fields of Argentina. The observed variations in the essential constituents of microbial food chains can produce major functional changes, which are mainly concerned with carbon fluxes affecting the whole dynamics of a freshwater ecosystem. National regulatory agencies establish environmentally safe concentrations of agrochemicals mainly based on results from monoculture experiments. However, this study provides evidence that such concentrations can be unrealistic because species exhibit different behavior when growing in a community. Despite the limitations of the experimental system, our results highlight the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict the sense, magnitude and direction of changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to 2,4-D formulations.",

Copyright notice ID: 6710492 PMID: 31463387 Abstract We evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), on the structure of both micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm; species composition and abundance) and cytometric populations (photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which included prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk); and bacterioplankton (HB), heterotrophic bacteria), using a microcosms-based approach and a single 7-day exposure. Assays were performed on two different microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two contrasting turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll a = 7.6 μgL-1, turbidity = 1 NTU) and organic turbid systems (chlorophyll a = 25.0 μgL-1, turbidity = 9 NTU). For each system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i.L−1. The impact of AsiMax 50® seemed to be greater in the turbid system. In this system, total abundance of living (live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and organic turbid systems, micro + nano phytoplankton decreased in species richness and abundance at higher herbicide concentrations. These results suggest that 2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as Ochromonas sp. and Chlamydomonas sp., showed different responses to herbicide exposure between water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation. However, caution must be taken when extrapolating these effects to real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm experiment.

Introduction With the advent of genetically modified crops and the introduction of no-till methods, herbicides have become the “stars” of the chemicals used in industrial agriculture. Currently, glyphosate-based herbicides, whose main mode of action is through the disruption of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis (Amrhein et al., 1980), are used worldwide, while other herbicides are applied as complementary tools for weed control. Herbicides have several different modes of action (Peterson et al., 2015). Auxinic herbicides, which belong to a chemical family largely used in agriculture, mimic the biphasic effects of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which is the principal natural auxin in higher plants. It usually stimulates growth by cell division and elongation when targeted to cell sites of action at low concentration (Grossmann, 2010). Auxin-derived herbicides such as phenoxy hormone products were used in an average of 22,916 tons worldwide between 1990-2002. The use of these herbicides was reported to increase an average of 30,436 tons of active ingredients between 2003-2014 (FAOSTAT, 2018). After more than 2 decades of glyphosate massive spraying in Argentina, the use of herbicides such as 2,4-D, paraquat and dicamba has sky-rocketed in the last years to prevent the spread of glyphosate resistance in target weeds. The 2,4-D was the third most imported herbicide into Argentina between 2013 and 2015 (SENASA, 2018), and now it is considered one of the most used agrochemicals worldwide (Singh and Singh, 2016). Moreover, plants genetically modified to tolerate different herbicides, including 2,4-D, were recently approved for commercial production in Argentina (CONABIA, 2019). Under this scenario, 2,4-D application rates are expected to increase in Argentina. The 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is an auxin-type selective herbicide that induces overgrowth of vascular cambium in dicotyledonous, ultimately leading to death (Song, 2014). After application, it is transformed by bacterial metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Singh and Singh, 2016). The persistence of 2,4-D in the environment depends on the availability of other carbon sources involved in microbial metabolism, its half-life being between 20 and 312 days (Islam et al., 2018). Build-up of 2,4-D residues may cause important alterations in soil and aquatic ecosystems. The 2,4-D can produce disruptive effects in fungi (Bernat et al., 2018), insects (Sharma et al., 2018), amphibians (LaChapelle et al., 2007; Aronzon et al., 2011; Van Meter et al., 2018), fish (Dehnert et al., 2018; De Arcaute et al., 2018), and others (Islam et a. 2018). Other studies reported the effect of pure 2,4-D on microbial communities (Kobraei and White, 1996; Aguayo et al., 2014; Lozano et al., 2018), but little is known about the collateral impact of commercial formulations of this herbicide on wild biota in agricultural landscapes. These commercial formulations consist of the active ingredient (2,4-D), water and inert elements such as solvents, surfactants and humectants of unknown composition which increase plant cuticle permeability to 2,4-D (Lanctôt et al., 2014). The 2,4-D has different effects according to its concentration: low concentrations stimulate the growth of some phytoplanktonic species, whereas high concentrations inhibit their development (Boyle, 1980; Kobraei and White, 1996; Wong, 2000). In regard to other freshwater communities, De Lipthay et al. (2003) reported that low concentrations of the active ingredient (a.i.) (<40 μg L−1) modify the structure of the bacterial community from a shallow aquifer, leading to an increase in 2,4-D degrading bacteria. In addition, an increase in Actinobacteria growth was detected at 20 mg L−1 of 2,4-D in an oligotrophic lake (Aguayo et al., 2014), which resulted from the ability of Arthrobacter sp. to use 2,4-D and other aromatic compounds as sources of carbon and energy (Sandmann and Loos, 1988; Westerberg et al., 2000). It is well known that freshwater systems become contaminated either by direct spraying over water or indirectly via soil drift (Ensminger et al., 2013; Aparicio et al., 2015; Berman et al., 2018; Metcalfe et al., 2019). Algae and cyanobacteria from lakes, ponds and rivers share several metabolic pathways with vascular plants, suggesting that they can be similarly affected by herbicides (Ferrari et al., 2018). Indeed, these organisms have shown to be severely altered, mainly at the population level (Vera et al., 2010, 2012; Lipok et al., 2010; Pérez et al., 2011; Qiu et al., 2013; Pizarro et al., 2016). They are important in freshwater ecosystems because of their role as main primary producers, either as free-living planktonic organisms or attached to diverse substrata (phyto-periphyton fraction). Taking into account the important ecosystem services supplied by freshwater systems, there is increasing concern about the deleterious effect of herbicides, as previously demonstrated for glyphosate (Pérez et al., 2007). There are more than 10,000 shallow lakes in the Pampa plain of Argentina (Dukatz et al., 2006), which is one of the most affected regions by agricultural activities worldwide. These water bodies switch between two alternative stable states with contrasting typologies (Scheffer et al., 1993): clear-water lakes with very low phytoplankton abundance and turbid ones dominated by phytoplankton. Both states show different phytoplankton populations, as they are adapted to distinct nutrient and light conditions (Allende et al., 2009). In last decades, however, there are some evidences indicating that lakes remain turbid due to agrochemical contamination (Quirós et al., 2002; Vera et al., 2010). In this work we evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D, on the structure of freshwater microbial communities under different exposure conditions using microcosms. The assays were carried out with two different consolidated microbial assemblages. One of these was sampled from a clear freshwater system and the other from a turbid freshwater system. We analyzed the quali- and quantitative composition of micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm) and photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which includes prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk). Bacterioplankton (HB, heterotrophic bacteria) was also considered in the analysis}. All the microbial communities were exposed to a wide range of concentrations of the active ingredient for 7 d. We tested the following hypotheses: 1- the impact of AsiMax 50® depends on water turbidity, which results from the different structure of the microbial communities; and 2- the impact of AsiMax 50® depends on the 2,4-D concentration used.2. Methods We performed a manipulative laboratory experiment with 48 microcosms, each of which consisted of a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask filled with water (experimental unit = e.u.), taken from two outdoor water systems of contrasting turbidity status. Of these, 24 were filled with clear water (thereafter referred to as clear) and 24 with organic turbid water (thereafter referred to as turbid). The initial conditions of water samples were: chlorophyll a = 7.6 μg L−1, turbidity = 1 NTU for clear and chlorophyll a = 25.0 μg L−1, turbidity = 9 NTU for turbid. These environmental variables are usually used to characterize the shallow lakes typical of the Pampa plain from Argentina (Allende et al., 2009). Microcosms were randomly placed in a shaking chamber set at 25 °C and 12:12 L:D photoperiod during the entire exposure to AsiMax 50®. After a microcosm stabilization period of 3 days, the experiment started with the addition of 2,4-D as commercial formulation of AsiMax 50®, randomly applied in triplicate, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i. L−1 to clear and turbid microcosms. The sampling scheme was as follows: a) samples were taken from 3 e.u. at zero time (T0, before addition of AsiMax 50®) to determine the initial conditions of physical and chemical parameters and micro + nanophytoplankton; b) samples were taken from all treatments after 7d (Tf, final time) to determine treatment effect; c) considering the time scale at which populations of very small organisms react to an impact (Peck, 2011), samples of PPP and HB were taken after 15 min (T1) and 7 d (Tf) of 2,4-D addition (n = 24 for both groups). 2.1. Physical and chemical parameters The real concentrations of 2,4-D were measured from water samples collected from all the e.u. and kept at -20 °C for further processing. For 2,4-D determination, samples were unfrozen, homogenized and diluted 1:10 with Milli-Q water. Finally, the samples were collected in 2-mL glass vials and the analysis was performed using HPLC-UV technique coupled with UV detector at 232 nm (APHA, 2005). Turbidity was measured with a portable turbidimeter (Hach® 2100 P).2.2. Biological variables 2.2.1. Chlorophyll a concentration For chlorophyll a determination, 200-mL water samples were filtered through Whatman® GF/F filters and stored at -20 °C. Chlorophyll a concentration values were obtained by spectrophotometric absorbance, using acetone as solvent. Absorbances were read at 665 and 750 nm, before and after acidification with HCl 1 N. Before reading, samples were first left overnight in the solvent and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm. Concentration values were obtained following Lilchtenthaler and Wellburn (1983).2.2.2. Micro and nano-phytoplankton (2–200 μm) A 200-mL water sample from each e.u. was fixed with acidified Lugol's iodine solution and kept at 4 °C for subsequent phytoplankton (˃2 μm) counts. These were made according to Utermöhl's technique (Utermöhl, 1958) to the lowest taxonomic level, distinguishing between live and dead organisms. Individuals were considered to be alive when they had an organized cell structure with undamaged chloroplasts and cell wall (e.g. frustules for diatoms), among other structures. A maximum counting error of 20% was accepted for the most abundant taxa (Venrick, 1978).2.2.3. PPP and HB populations (<2 μm) Picoplankton, which comprised different PPP populations, and HB were analyzed using a FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson®) flow cytometer equipped with a standard 15 mW blue argon-ion (488 nm emission) laser and a red laser diode (635 nm). Samples (3.6 mL) were fixed with 10% cold glutaraldehyde (1% final concentration), left in the dark for 10 min at room temperature and then stored at -80 °C. Two subsamples were taken for separate counts of HB and PPP. For HB, 400-μl samples were stained with SYBRGreen I (Sigma Aldrich®) diluted in DMSO to a final concentration of 1X, left for about 10 min in the dark to complete the nucleic-acid staining and run in the flow cytometer. A known volume of beads (1-μm diameter, Fluospheres®) was added to unfrozen samples. HB were detected by their signature in plots of side scatter light (SSC) versus green fluorescence of nucleic acid-bound stains FITC (FL1 530 nm) and SSC (side scatter) axes (e.g. Gasol et al., 1999). Turbid samples were previously diluted with pre-filtered PBS (1:10). For PPP we used the same procedure as for HB, but without stain addition. Picoplanktonic algae were identified in plots of SSC versus blue laser-dependent red fluorescence (PerCP or FL3, 670 nm), orange fluorescence (PE or FL2 585/42 nm) versus FL3, and red laser-dependent far-red fluorescence (APC or FL4, 661 nm) versus FL3.2.2.4. Analysis of the contribution of autotrophic fractions to total autotrophic biomass To compare the contribution of micro + nanophytoplankton and PPP populations to the autotrophic biomass at Tf, the biovolume of each size fraction was calculated for control and herbicide treatments for clear and turbid systems at Tf. The biovolume of micro + nano phytoplankton was calculated following Rott (1981) and Hillebrand et al. (1999). In regard to PPP, a sphere with a theoretical size of 0.9 μm was considered for PE-Pcy, PC-Pcy and PEuk, which represents a theoretical biovolume three times higher than that of Pcy (Callieri, 2008).2.3. Statistical and numerical analysis The homogeneity of the e.u. was verified in terms of water turbidity, for both turbid and clear systems, just before the addition of AsiMax 50® by a Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric ANOVA by ranks test (KW). Statistical differences in turbidity, chlorophyll a concentration and abundance of micro + nano phytoplankton between turbidity states were analyzed at Tf using one-way ANOVA (factor treatment = control and six AsiMax 50® concentration levels). Multiple comparisons were carried out using Tukey test. The Holm-Sidak method was used to compare treated and control groups. RM-ANOVA was applied for testing the significance of PPP and HB counts, with two factors: time (T1 and Tf) and treatment (control and six AsiMax 50® concentration levels). For nano + micro phytoplankton, a Pearson correlation matrix was calculated among the abundances of live organisms of species from all treatments, for each type of system. Species that were recorded more than five times in all samples and in at least two e.u. of the same treatment, were included in the analysis. These matrices were incorporated into Cytoscape® v 3.7.1 software (Shannon et al., 2003) to build networks among species. In addition, the following indices were calculated (Magurran, 2013): richness (S); the Simpson index as 1-D, where D = ∑(ni(ni−1)N(N−1)), ni is the number of organisms of the ith species and N is the total number of organisms; and evenness E= (1/D)/S).3.

There were significant decreases with respect to control in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment: 36.7%, for the turbid (ANOVA; p = 0.006), and 76.9% for the clear system (ANOVA, p˂0.001).3.2.2.

Under the clear condition and considering T0 and Tf, this group made up 71% of the total micro + nanoplankton abundance, followed by Dinophyceae (12.1%), Bacillariophyceae (8.86%), Crysophyceae (7.8%) and Cryptophyceae (0.2%). At T0, Chlorophyta represented 38.8% of the total abundance of the micro + nano planktonic fraction. At Tf, this group showed significant increases in abundance between the AsiMax 50® treatments and the control (ANOVA, p˂0.001), except for 2,000 mg L−1, where the percentages of all groups were similar to those at T0 (Fig. 2A). In the turbid system, Chlorophyta dominated in richness and abundance, followed by Crysophyceae (1.2%), Cyanobacteria (0.8%) and Dinophyceae (0.6%). At T0, Chlorophyta made up 95.7% of the total abundance, and a significant increase was observed at Tf (ANOVA p = 0.046), with a mean value of 97.7% for all treatments (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab A-B. Abundance percentages of micro + nanophytoplanktonic groups at T0 (control) and Tf (control and 2,4-D concentrations) for clear and turbid systems.In the clear system, mean total abundance of micro + nano plankton at T0 was 2,324 ± 352 individuals (ind) mL−1, with 61.5% of live organisms (Fig. 3A). At Tf, mean total abundance for the control was ∼5 times greater than that at T0 (ANOVA, p = 0.003) while no AsiMax 50® effect was found on total abundance. In the turbid system, mean total abundance of micro + nano plankton at T0 was 663,603 ± 40,174 ind mL−1 (mean ± SD), with 90.2% of live organisms (Fig. 3B). At Tf, no significant change was recorded for the control between T0 and Tf. Moreover, the 0.02, 0.2, 2 and 20 mg L−1 treatments led to a significant increase in the total abundance compared to control (ANOVA, p < 0.001, p = 0.003, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). On the other hand, the 200 and 2000 mg L−1 treatments did not differ significantly in total live abundances with respect to control. For both clear and turbid systems, data of the abundance of live organisms at Tf were fitted to second-order polynomial curves from all the herbicide treatments (Figs. 3 A and B). Better fit to a humped-shaped curve was found for the turbid (R2 = 0.64) compared with the clear (R2 = 0.41) system. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab A-D.

(*) Significant differences with respect to control (p < 0.05).The values of total live abundance of micro + nano plankton mentioned above were in agreement with the variations in abundance of the most abundant species for each type of system. In the clear system, Choricystis sp. was the dominant taxon in all treatments, followed by Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp. At Tf, the live abundance of Choricystis sp. showed a significant decrease with respect to control (ANOVA, p = 0.047), with a significant increase in dead abundance (ANOVA, p˂0.001) (Fig. 3C). Moreover, at Tf a significant increase in dead abundance was found for Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp. in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment (ANOVA, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). In the turbid system, Staurastrum sp. showed the highest value of live abundance, with significant increments in the 0.02, 0.2, 2 and 20 mg L−1 treatments (Fig. 3D). A significant increase in dead abundance was found in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment (ANOVA, p<0.001). This species was followed in live abundance by Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp., whose live and dead abundances did not show any clear trend due to herbicide input (Fig. 3D). In summary, in the clear system the micro + nanoplanktonic fraction showed the largest difference in composition between control and the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment, while in the turbid system its quali- and quantitative composition in the 200 and 2,000 mg L−1 treatments was similar to that in the control. Correlation networks of live abundance were constructed for micro + nanoplanktonic species to analyze the relationships among taxa exposed to AsiMax 50® under clear and turbid conditions (Fig. 4). The networks included 10 and 7 species for the clear and turbid systems, respectively. Taxa were more significantly and positively intercorrelated in the turbid (mean r = 0.62) than in the clear system (mean r = 0.56). As already mentioned, some species were present in both systems (i.e. Chlamydomonas sp., Staurastrum sp., Ochromonas sp., Tetraedron minimum and Peridinium sp.). However, they responded differently to the herbicide depending on the system. Chlamydomonas sp. was negatively affected in the clear system but not in the turbid one (Fig. 3C). According to the correlation network, the abundance of Chlamydomonas sp. was significantly and positively correlated with the most abundant species, Staurastrum sp. (r Pearson = 0.60; p = 0.002) (Fig. 4). In the clear system, no-significant correlation was observed between the abundances of Chlamydomonas sp. and of any of the species significantly stimulated by the herbicide. In the turbid system, Staurastrum sp. was the species most strongly stimulated by AsiMax 50® (Fig. 3C) and the most correlated with the subdominant taxa (Fig. 4). This trend was not observed in the clear system, where the abundance of Staurastrum sp. was not correlated with that of any other species. The abundance of Ochromonas sp. also varied depending on the type of system, i.e. its abundance decreased in the clear system, while it increased at low 2,4-D concentrations and decreased at higher concentrations in the turbid one (Fig. 3C). The abundance of this species was significantly and positively correlated with that of Staurastrum sp. (r Pearson = 0.72; p = 0.0001), while it was not significantly correlated with that of any other species in the clear system (Fig. 4). Fig. 4.

Networks were built with Cytoscape® v3.7.1 software.At T0, mean values of richness, diversity and evenness were higher in the clear system (S = 7.00 ± 1.00, D = 0.74 ± 0.03 and E = 0.57 ± 0.14) than in the turbid one (S = 6.67 ± 0.58, D = 0.14 ± 0.03 and E = 0.17 ± 0.01. In general, at Tf, these parameters showed no significant differences between herbicide treatments and control for both types of systems, except for the following: (a) for the clear system, a significant decrease in D (ANOVA, p = 0.04) was observed in the 200 mg L−1 treatment with respect to control, with D = 0.29 ± 0.13; (b) for the turbid system, S and E decreased significantly in the 200 mg L−1 treatment, with S = 3.67 ± 0.58 (ANOVA, p = 0.006) and E = 0.29 ± 0.05 (ANOVA p = 0.041); and in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment, with S = 3.00 ± 1.00 (ANOVA p˂0.001) and E = 0.38 ± 0.12 (ANOVA, p = 0.001).3.2.3. Cytometric populations (0.2–2 μm): PPP and HB Cytograms of samples of control and herbicide treatments collected at T1 and Tf revealed four cytometric populations, of which one corresponded to HB, and the other three to photosynthetic populations: PEuk, PC-Pcy and PE-Pcy. The HB was more abundant than PPP, both in the clear and turbid systems, ranging between a maximum of 99.7% (clear, Tf, 2,000 mg L−1) and a minimum of 80.9% (turbid, Tf, 2,000 mg L−1) (Table 3). RM-ANOVA revealed significant differences in the abundance of HB and PPP between T1 and Tf for the clear and turbid systems (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.018 and p = 0.001 respectively). In regard to treatment effects, PPP showed significant variations in abundance at 2,000 mg L−1 of 2,4-D with a rapid significant increment of ∼5 times at T1 compared to control (RM-ANOVA, p < 0.001 in both systems, Table 3). This increase continued until Tf in the turbid system, while it did not in the clear one (RM-ANOVA, p < 0.001). The same increase in abundance was observed in the 200 mg L−1 treatment (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.003) for the turbid system at Tf. The abundance of the HB fraction was significantly increased by ∼3 times at Tf in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment only for the clear system (ANOVA, p<0.001). Table 3.

PE-Pcy was the best represented group of the PPP populations, ranging from 53.8% (Tf, 20 mg L−1) to 99.2% (T1, 2,000 mg L−1) for the clear system and from 96.0% (Tf, 0.2 mg L−1) to 99.0% (Tf, 2,000 mg L−1) for the turbid system (Fig. 5). For the clear system at T1, PEuk abundance ranged between a minimum of 856 ± 202 ind mL−1 (200 mg L−1) to a maximum of 1,284 ± 466 ind mL−1 (2,000 mg mL−1), with no significant differences among treatments (Fig. 6A). At Tf, PEuk abundance ranged from 509 ± 111 ind mL−1 (2,000 mg L−1) to 9,118 ± 2,268 ind mL−1 (control). RM-ANOVA analysis showed no significant growth of PEuk in microcosms treated with 2,000 mg L−1 (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.580), while this population showed a significant growth response in the rest of the treatments, including controls. Such growth inhibition at 2,000 mg L−1 led to a significant decrease in PEuk abundance of ∼18 times at Tf, compared to control (ANOVA, p˂0.001) (Fig. 6A). In the turbid system at T1, PEuk abundance ranged from 6,621 ± 368 ind mL−1 (0.02 mg L−1) to 39,887 ± 11,842 ind mL−1 (2,000 mg L−1). At this time, a significant increment of ∼5 times compared to control was measured in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment (ANOVA, p˂0.001) (Fig. 6B). At Tf, the abundance of this fraction ranged from 2,950 ± 223 (20 mg L−1) to 10,979 ± 4,271 (2,000 mg L−1), with no significant differences between treatments and control. The abundance of this population decreased significantly between T1 and Tf for the 200 and 2,000 mg L−1 treatments (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.026 and p<0.001 respectively), resulting from an early growth and a subsequent decrease.

Different letters mean significant differences (p<0.05).In the clear system, PC-Pcy abundance ranged from a minimum mean (±SD) value of 166 ± 29 (200 mg L−1) to a maximum of 282 ± 87 ind mL−1 (20 mg L−1) at T1, while it ranged from 80 ± 75 (0.02 mg L−1) to 286 ± 91 ind mL−1 (2,000 mg L−1) at Tf (Fig. 6C). In the turbid system, its abundance ranged from 80 ± 77 (0.2 mg L−1) to 206 ± 86 (200 mg L−1) at T1, and from 187 ± 90 (0.2 mg L−1) to 333 ± 207 ind mL−1 (0.02 mg L−1) at Tf (Fig. 6D). No significant effects between treatments were found in any case for this population. PE-Pcy, the most abundant PPP fraction, at T1 ranged from 22,969 ± 2,530 (200 mg L−1) to 164,130 ± 48,443 ind mL−1 (2,000 mg L−1) in the clear system. At this time, a significant increase in PE-Pcy abundance of ∼5 times was observed in relation to control in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment (ANOVA, p˂<0.001) (Fig. 6E). At Tf, there were no significant variations, with a minimum of 15,527 ± 8,418 (0.02 mg L−1) and a maximum of 23,553 ± 4,497 ind mL−1 (control). RM-ANOVA revealed an early increase (at T1) in the abundance of this fraction in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment, with a subsequent decline at Tf (RM-ANOVA, p<0.001). In the turbid system, this fraction ranged from 62,626 ± 44,171 (0.02 mg L−1) to 651,631 ± 68,514 ind L−1 (2,000 mg L−1) at T1 and from 115,508 ± 16,676 (2 mg L−1) to 853,987 ± 230,227 ind L−1 (2,000 mg L−1) at Tf (Fig. 6F). This population showed a significant increase in abundance of ∼4 times at T1, and of ∼5 times at Tf in the 2,000 mg L−1 treatment compared to control (ANOVA, p0.001 in both cases). Also, an increase in abundance of ∼3 times was recorded in the 200 mg L−1 treatment (ANOVA, p˂0.001) at Tf for the turbid system (Fig. 6F). These increases persisted between T1 and Tf for the 200 and 2,000 mg L−1 treatments (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.004 and p = 0.017, respectively). At Tf, the percentage contribution of the different size autotrophic fractions to total autotrophic biomass varied among groups (Table 4). For the turbid system, micro + nano phytoplankton showed a lower contribution in the treatments at higher concentrations (200 and 2,000 mg L−1) (ANOVA, p = 0.005 and p<0.001, respectively). This decrease was in accordance with the increase in the percentage contribution of the PE-Pcy fraction at 200 mg L−1 (ANOVA, p = 0.004), as well as with the increase in the percentage contribution of both PE-Pcy (ANOVA, p<0.001) and PEuk (ANOVA, p = 0.002) fractions at 2,000 mg L−1.

On the contrary, no correlations were found between these variables in the clear system.4. Discussion Our results strongly suggest that the degree of water turbidity affects the response of the studied freshwater populations exposed for 7 days to the 2,4-D-based herbicide Asimax 50®. We found differences in the structural integrity of the phytoplankton and picoplankton communities from low to high concentrations of the active ingredient. The impact of AsiMax 50® on micro + nano phytoplankton seemed to be greater in the turbid than in the clear system, in terms of both richness and abundance. An experimental effect of the clear system on this fraction was likely to occur between T0 and Tf, compared to control. This was not observed in the turbid system and may be attributable to a “confinement effect” (Pesce et al., 2009), which takes place after samples collected from a natural system are placed into microcosms of lower volume. At T0, phytoplankton diversity, richness and evenness were higher in the clear than in the turbid system. At Tf, no decrease in phytoplankton richness was observed for any treatment in the clear system, while it decreased significantly at 200 and 2,000 mg L−1 of 2,4-D in the turbid system. This suggests that some species cannot survive at the higher herbicide concentrations, in agreement with that reported for 2,4-D by Kobraei and White (1996). Communities with high levels of diversity tend to be more resilient to environmental changes (Oliver et al., 2015), due to redundancy among different species sharing similar functions. Resilience increases if these species also show differential resistance to a contaminant. Indeed, Girvan et al. (2005) have demonstrated that bacterial diversity in soils promotes community stability and resilience after benzene perturbation. In the case of phytoplankton, it is expected that the differential sensitivity of species to herbicides (Huertas et al., 2010) as well as their presence and relative abundance, will determine the response of the community as a whole. The richer the community, the greater the chance for the presence of tolerant or resistant species to a contaminant, and the response of the community will rely upon the evenness and sensitivity of the dominant species, if any. In general, natural or anthropogenic agents induce a wide range of responses in biological entities, according to their scale of complexity (Peck, 2011). For example, variations in total abundance may reflect different physiological strategies. In our study, phytoplanktonic species that survived at 2,000 mg L−1 of 2,4-D in the clear system and at 200 and 2,000 mg L−1 of 2,4-D in the turbid system showed low abundance values due to decreased reproduction. A similar behavior was observed for phytoplankton exposed to the commercial glyphosate-based formulation RoundUp®, which had no effect on species richness but produced a significant strong decrease in total abundance (Pérez et al., 2007). The abundance of the micro + nano phytoplankton community decreased at higher concentrations and increased at lower concentrations of 2,4-D (0.02; 0.2; 2 and 20 mg L−1), with a humped-shaped, dose-dependent response. This effect was more clearly noted in the turbid than in the clear system. Although we used a commercial formulation with undeclared ingredients to obtain a more realistic approach, stimulation effects on phytoplankton are consistent with those previously reported for the active principle. In this regard, further experiments comparing the effects of pure 2,4-D and AsiMax® are required for a more conclusive assessment. Nevertheless, the stimulation of phytoplankton at low doses of 2,4-D has been already reported in studies involving algal monoculture trials and mesocosms (Boyle, 1980; Kobraei and White, 1996; Wong, 2000). The auxin pathways and their modes of action are well-known for vascular plants, but not for algae (Žižková et al., 2016) and after many years of debate (Lau et al., 2009), the presence of auxin pathways in algae and cyanobacteria was finally confirmed by Sergeeva et al. (2002). Certainly, the fact that 2,4-D induces growth at low doses and causes growth inhibition at higher ones provides evidence that it may mimic hormonal function. Moreover, the presence or absence of auxin pathways in the different species (e.g. Staurastrum sp., dominant in the turbid system) occurring in each community, could be determinant for the whole community response. Žižková et al. (2016) demonstrated that some cyanobacteria and algae that differ taxonomically possess different concentrations of IAA. They found that four species of Chlamydomonales have low IAA concentration, while some Desmidiales, the same group as that of Staurastrum sp., have high IAA concentration. Different sensitivity was observed for Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp. that were present in both kinds of systems. These species tended to decrease in abundance with respect to control in the clear system while they tended to increase in the turbid one. The impact of 2,4-D on the community may not only be direct, according to species sensitivity but also indirect, via the interactions among community members. The differential absorption and/or utilization of the 2,4-D by certain species may indirectly affect the total abundance of others. In our case, it is possible that the intake of 2,4-D by the dominant Staurastrum sp. limited the exposure of other species to the herbicide. In addition, the 2,4-D may indirectly affect the freshwater community through ecological interactions such as competition, facilitation and/or predation. Numerous examples of these indirect effects due to different contaminants can be found in the comprehensive review by Fleeger et al. (2003). In our study, the sensitivity of Chlamydomonas sp. to 2,4-D detected in the clear system was probably masked in the turbid one by Staurastrum sp. growth. A similar process would have occurred for Ochromonas sp. The correlation network analyses suggest that the 2,4-D stimulated the growth of Staurastrum sp. when it was predominant through a putative auxin pathway, and that this allowed the development of other species that are actually sensitive to 2,4-D. In brief, the capacity of Staurastrum sp. to rapidly absorb the contaminant may have decreased the exposure of other species in the turbid system. The fact that Staurastrum sp. occurred in the clear system but in a very low proportion may indicate that not only species composition but also their relative abundance are important to predict the behavior of the system in response to a contaminant. The comparison of the correlation networks indicated that species were less intercorrelated in the clear system than in the turbid one, suggesting greater community stability for the former than for the latter under herbicide stress. In a less stable community, the change in one species affects the other species. The difficulty of determining the processes that control the responses of a given species strongly underlines the need to be cautious when extrapolating results from monospecific assays to realistic field situations. Lozano et al. (2018), who performed a microcosm experiment with the same Staurastrum sp. as used here but collected from a phytoplanktonic community with different structural characteristics, reported that it always decreased in abundance after exposure at different concentrations of 2,4-D in pure form. This suggests that the same species may respond differently to agrochemicals depending, on one hand, on the characteristics of their phytoplankton community and, on the other hand, on the form of the chemical assayed (i.e. pure versus formulation). AsiMax 50® is a commercial formulation based on 2,4-D as active ingredient, with coadjuvants and other substances. The use of active ingredient and/or commercial formulations makes the comparison across assays difficult. The impacts of active ingredients and commercial formulations on freshwater organisms and/or communities have been well documented for different herbicides (Tsui and Chu, 2003; Annett et al., 2014; Lipok et al., 2010; De Stefano et al., 2018). The significant increase in the abundance of HB was only observed at the highest 2,4-D concentration in the clear system, probably because the herbicide acted as a nutrient source for bacterial growth. On the other hand, the HB did not show a significant growth in the turbid system probably because its initial abundance was sufficient to metabolize the herbicide. Pizarro et al. (2016) studied the impact of glyphosate formulation Glifosato Atanor® on microbial communities from clear and organic turbid freshwater systems. In agreement with our study, they found that abundance of bacteria only increased in clear water, most likely because the herbicide was used as nutrient source. The effect of 2,4-D on bacterial communities has been studied by Aguayo et al. (2014), who observed that the phylum Actinobacteria was predominant at 20 mg L−1 of 2,4-D, using water from a cold and pristine oligotrophic lake. Likewise, De Lipthay et al. (2003) reported that a long-term exposure of a subsurface aquifer to a mixture of auxinic herbicides at low concentrations (<40 μg L−1) induced the increment of phenoxy acid-degrading bacteria. The PPP fraction also seemed to experience more pronounced changes in the turbid than in the clear system. It showed a rapid response after 15 min at the highest herbicide concentration in both clear and turbid systems, which was determined by the different behavior of their respective components. This effect was due to a rapid increase in the abundance of PE-Pcy in the clear system and of PEuk and PE-Pcy in the turbid one. The PPP fraction also showed an increase in abundance at the higher herbicide concentrations at Tf in the turbid system. This was mediated by an increase in the PE-Pcy fraction, which was probably stimulated by the combination of direct and indirect effects of AsiMax 50®. The herbicide would act directly on the PE-Pcy fraction if it had auxin pathways, and in this regard Žižková et al. (2016) found that two species of cyanobacteria (Chroococcus minutus and Phormidium animale) contained very high amounts of endogenous auxin (IAA). On the other hand, the decrease in the micro + nano plankton in the same treatments could have indirectly stimulated the growth of PE-Pcy due to decreased competitive pressure. Changes in micro + nano phytoplankton and PPP abundance accounted for changes in chlorophyll a concentration; this is particularly true for the former fraction, which represented more than 99% of the total phytoplanktonic biomass. This phenomenon was more clearly observed in the turbid system, where chlorophyll a concentration followed a similar hump-shaped, dose-dependence pattern as that obtained for micro + nano phytoplankton abundance. Changes in turbidity resembled those in chlorophyll a concentration, especially for the turbid system, where both variables decreased to lower levels. The Pampa Plain in Argentina has plenty of permanent shallow lakes with contrasting water turbidity and phytoplankton biomass. It is one of the principal agricultural regions worldwide, where millions of liters of agrochemicals are used each year. The present investigation provides new evidence on the mode of action of the 2,4-D-based herbicide Asimax 50® in freshwater, which is one of the most frequently used commercial formulations in agricultural fields of Argentina. The observed variations in the essential constituents of microbial food chains can produce major functional changes, which are mainly concerned with carbon fluxes affecting the whole dynamics of a freshwater ecosystem. National regulatory agencies establish environmentally safe concentrations of agrochemicals mainly based on results from monoculture experiments. However, this study provides evidence that such concentrations can be unrealistic because species exhibit different behavior when growing in a community. Despite the limitations of the experimental system, our results highlight the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict the sense, magnitude and direction of changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to 2,4-D formulations.Declarations Author contribution statement Lozano V.L.: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.

    "abstract": "Abstract Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. Subject terms: Plant signalling, Tropism, Plant hormones",
    "introduction": "Introduction The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18. Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling are induced by specific conditions or stresses, including flooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18. Ethylene signaling pathway starts with ethylene receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane19–21 and ends with gene regulation in the nucleus22–24. In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events25,26. When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethylene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil30. Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall composition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene36,37. However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing.",
    "methods": "Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2 s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agronomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of filled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity. Plasmid construction and plant transformation The CRISPR/Cas9 system63 was used to knock out OsCRW1 (Os06g0605900) and OsEBF2 (Os02g0200900) in the Zhonghua11 background and OsEBF2, OsEIL1 (Os03g0324200), OsEIL2 (Os07g0685700), OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000), and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) in the crw1 background. Two 20-bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) of each gene and cloned into two single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes of pYLgRNA-OsU6a and pYLgRNA-OsU6b by overlapping PCR, producing proU6a-T1-sgRNA and proU6b-T2-sgRNA fragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into the BsaI site of the pYLCRISPR-Cas9Pubi-H vector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs of proOsCRW1::OsCRW1, proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400 and proOs06g0619600::Os06g0619600, we amplified the promoter (1739 bp of proOsCRW1, 3 Kb of proOs06g0604400 and 3 Kb of proOs06g0619600) and the open reading frame (ORF) of OsCRW1, Os06g0604400 and Os06g0619600 from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the EcoRI/XbaI site of the pCAMBIAL1301 vector. To generate proOsCRW1::GFP constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from the pUN1301 vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the HindIII/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. To generate pOsCRW1::GUS constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced OsCRW1 promoter into the HindIII/BamHI site of the p1300 vector. To generate proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag and proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag constructs, we amplified the promoter (2588 bp of proOsEIL1, 2500 bp of proOsEIL2) and the full-length CDS (without the stop codon) of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the BamHI/SpeI site of the pTCK303 vector. To generate proUbi::OsEIL1 (OsEIL1-OX) and proUbi::OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) constructs, we amplified the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 or crw1 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation64. Transformants were verified by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Zhonghua11 expressing DR5rev::VENUS65, proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP14, or NES-YC3.665 were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressing proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag were crossed with crw1 or oscrw1KO lines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant background by PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments. Root growth experiments Germinated seeds were placed on a net floating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66 for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, and the pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutrients, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of crw1 and WT in hydroponic boxes filled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solution pH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), with or without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and 5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown in water and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH = 5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using a dissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was measured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of WT and crw1 in agar-solidified medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm) of WT and crw1 were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow vertically for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in the middle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionized water for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl3 (100 μM) were added to deionized water or agar medium according to different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 biological replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponic experiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experiments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments. MutMap-based gene cloning To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype of crw1, we backcrossed crw1 to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F1 progenies. F1 progenies were selfed to generate F2 progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F2 plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomic DNA of crw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 50× and 30× coverage for crw1 and WT, respectively), generating 150-bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWA software67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68. Causative variant were calculated using the MutMap SNP-index method69 and candidate SNPs were identified. Tissue expression pattern analysis of OsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GUS were grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durations for GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and other tissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C, transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed under an ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GFP were grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for fluorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP fluorescence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm for excitation. Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs of GFP-OsCRW1 or GFP-OsERF82 driven by the CaMV35S promoter (pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82), we amplified the full-length CDS of OsCRW1 or OsERF82 from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of the pSAT6-GFP-C vector. The fragments of pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82 were isolated from the pSAT6-GFP-C vector by PI-PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of the pRCS2 vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for transient expression70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at 505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nm and 360 nm for excitation, respectively. Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1% (w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded, sectioned according to a previous method71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol’s solution for 1 minute, washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope for the observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol’s stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KI solution. Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS Plants expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP or the reporter gene for auxin response (DR5rev::VENUS) or for cytosolic Ca2+ (NES-YC3.6, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP fluorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS fluorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement of cpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer according to a previous method50. The ECFP fluorescence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for excitation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively65. TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of root caps. Root tips were sampled and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solution (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1 and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGADT7 to generate the pGADT7-OsEIL1 and pGADT7-EIL2 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The pGBKT7-OsCRW1 plasmid and pGADT7-OsEIL1 or pGADT7-OsEIL2 plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs. pGBKT7-53 together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a positive control, and pGBKT7-lam together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on a double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal) for growth. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was fused to the vector of pDONR221-P3P2, and the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 were fused to the vector of pDONR221-P1P4 by gateway cloning, and then were transferred into pBiFCt-2in1-NN vector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The final plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were infiltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after infiltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Western blot For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActin in the roots of WT and crw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteins were denatured by heating at 95 oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128, 1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence was performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Yeast one-hybrid The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGADT7 vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detect the binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter of OsERF82, we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBSmut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box (CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-boxmut, ACCACC; G-boxmut, AACTTG; DRE/CRTmut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control. pAbAi carrying different binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain to screen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibiting transcriptional self-activation. pGADT7 carrying OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 or OsERF82, and pAbAi carrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deficient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-deficient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET29a vector and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 to express OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His or OsERF82-His fusion protein. OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His and OsERF82-His fusion proteins were purified from E. coli by nickel affinity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence of OsERF82 or designed for the ERF-binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes to synthesize biotin-labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The protein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20 min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at 4 °C, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross-linking, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay The ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP™ ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plants of pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 were grown in water for two day, and 15-20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for each experiment. Root tissue was cross-linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde under vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and fragmented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200-500 bp, and 2% of the yield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1-DNA and OsEIL2-DNA complex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime, P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028, China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2 M) was added to the solution of protein-DNA complex and heated at 65 °C for 4 hours to remove the cross-linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform agent for DNA purification (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table 3) were designed near the three EBS sequences on the OsERF82 promoter. Primers and purified DNA were used for ChIP-qPCR. Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS of OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The pGBKT7-OsERF82 plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain. pGBKT7 plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Trp-deficient SD medium and double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X-α-gal) for growth. RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on roots of crw1 and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group contained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and read counts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on the number of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html). RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1 μg of total RNA to 20 μL cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an RT-PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). OsActin and OsHistone were used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2–Δ(ΔCt). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

    "results": "Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1). Fig. 1. crw1 shows defective gravitropism when grown in water but not in soil. Open in a new tab a–d Seedlings of WT and crw1 were grown in water or soil for 2 days. a Root phenotypes. b Root caps. c Lugol’s staining of amyloplast. d, e Responses of WT and crw1 roots to gravity stimulation.

The direction of each root tip was measured as the absolute value toward the direction of gravity.

WT and crw1 expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP grew in water or soil for two days. Scale bars are 1 cm in (a, d), 100 μm in (b, c, f, g) and 20 μm in (h). Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Plants were grown to maturity in two paddy fields. In one paddy field, no significant difference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. 4c–h), whereas in the other field there was a small and significant reduction in the percentage of filled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 4i–n). crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic The coiling phenotype of crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. 1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. 1c). When roots were placed horizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating impaired gravitropic response. Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11. To examine the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. 1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. 1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapid accumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it to grow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in the gravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells in crw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). Applying the auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root cap resulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VENUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). In Arabidopsis thaliana, symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward flow of auxin from the root tip12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter (pOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP) into WT and crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost in crw1 (Fig. 1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin distribution observed in crw1 root tips. When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and gravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these data suggest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxin distribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization. Cloning the causative gene of crw1 To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F1 plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and the F2 progeny segregated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio (χ2 = 0.002, P = 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomic resequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F2 progeny and identified three candidate genes, Os06g0604400, Os06g0605900, and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). Complementation tests identified Os06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identified in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of transcription (Fig. 2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The three oscrw1KO lines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and these defective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).

Data are means ± SD, n = 4 in (b) and n = 10 in (d); In (f), n = 11 in oscrw1KO-1 of soil group, 13 in WT and crw1 of soil group and 12 in the other columns. Significant difference from WT was determined by two-sided Student’s t-test. Scale bars are 1 cm in (e and c), 1 mm in (g), 200 μm in (h) and 20 μm in (i). The data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Analysis of transgenic plants expressing pOsCRW1::GFP and pOsCRW1::GUS showed that OsCRW1 was expressed in both roots and shoots (Fig. 2g, h and Supplementary Fig. 11). In roots, OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. 2g, h). Transient expression of p35S::GFP-OsCRW1 in rice protoplasts showed that OsCRW1 was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2i). Elevated ethylene response in crw1 when grown in hydroponic OsCRW1 encodes an F-box domain containing protein (OsEBF1), a homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 (AtEBF1)27,28. Recent studies showed that OsEBF1 and OsEBF2 negatively control ethylene signaling like AtEBF1 and AtEBF238, and loss of function of OsEBF1 or OsEBF2 led to a hypersensitivity of root and coleoptile to exogenous ethylene38, and a decreased resistance to brown planthopper in rice39,40. To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism was found (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). Knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affect the phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggesting that OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in root gravitropism. We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being significantly upregulated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. 3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 13). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescued the phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and root coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1KO lines in water (Fig. 3c–f), suggesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype.

Data shown are mean ± SD, n = 6 in the control group and 7 in the 1-MCP group. Significant difference from WT was determined by two-sided Student’s t-test.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.The above findings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, like Arabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors27,28. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethylene signaling and targets of AtEBF141,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressing pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WT when grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared when grown in soil (Fig. 4a, b). WT roots grown in water, submerged paddy soil, vermiculite or soil-vermiculite mixture showed similarly low levels of OsEIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicative of similar levels of ethylene in these media. In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compacted soil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm−3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30 Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1) or OsEIL2 (oseil2KO/crw1) in crw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1. These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causing the root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger role than OsEIL2.

When grown in water, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c). Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotype resembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. In contrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition may repress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis43. When grown in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e). OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82 To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERF genes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phenotype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERF genes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERF genes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERF genes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERF genes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000) and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) were significantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and associated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supplementary Fig. 17d–f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82KO/crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 or OsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 could specifically bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in the OsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 in crw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the transcription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 to amplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water. The complete rescue of the crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved. OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed that genes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also enriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the root coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS-responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene (RBOHH) and four class III peroxidase genes were upregulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and functionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS fluorescent probe H2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramatically, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells (Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermiculite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed in the root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS46 and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death and sloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coiling phenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 roots, we grew WT, crw1, oseil1KO/crw1 lines, oseil2KO/crw1 lines, and oserf82KO/crw1 lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2, or OsERF82 in crw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore how enhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g0695400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC), GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG)47 (Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 specifically bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereas knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 in crw1 suppressed the upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d). Taken together, amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes. Mechanical resistance on the root tip rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 After identifying amplified ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impaired gravitropism in crw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 when plants were grown in water-saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig. 3). These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35-67 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 3a), which is 25-47 folds smaller than that in the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%) and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6 g cm−3 (i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al.30). To test the strength of mechanical resistance required to rescue the crw1 phenotype, we grew the mutant and WT in agar-solidified medium varying in the hardness by adding different amounts of agar (0.3 – 1.2%, mass/volume). crw1 showed root coiling in 0.3% and 0.4% agar media (penetration resistance 1 - 6 Pa) just as in water or nutrient solution (Supplementary Fig. 2b), curvy roots in 0.6% agar (penetration resistance 19 Pa), and normal straight roots in 0.8 – 1.2% agar (penetration resistance 34 – 77 Pa) (Fig. 6a–c). Similar phenotypic responses to different concentrations of agar (0.4%, 0.8% and 1.2%) were observed when crw1 plants were grown on the surface of vertical agar plates tilted at a 10° angle to allow the root tips in contact with varying degrees of mechanical resistance (Supplementary Fig. 22). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of ≥ 34 Pa is sufficient to rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1. Fig. 6.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1-mm diameter) to the root tip of crw1 grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig. 6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. The resistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to be approximately 104 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 23). The attachment of foam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin distribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribution and the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Fig. 6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism in crw1. Soil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth30. We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. 25). Increasing bulk density to 1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. 25). The larger inhibition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling. Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49. To investigate whether Ca2+ signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1, we expressed NES-YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a significantly higher [Ca2+]cyt signal than those growing in water, and there were no significant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cyt signal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased significantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥ 34 Pa enhances [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance. Fig. 7.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+ signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1’s phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl3, a Ca2+ channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl3 suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps (Fig. 7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxin distribution (Fig. 7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl3 abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue of gravitropism in crw1. The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. 4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca2+ signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was suppressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μM LaCl3 to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps, resulting in an over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in the crw1 roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no significant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition of LaCl3 (Supplementary Fig. 28), suggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+ signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS production in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl3 to 0.8% agar medium significantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence of OsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 transcription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibits the amplified module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism. The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth phenotype when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230 rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower Yangtze River delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibited the root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respectively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. 30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of root coiling accessions had a significantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Addition of 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (Supplementary Fig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likely caused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotype recovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 30g).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. Open in a new tab The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuring gravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator (https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html). The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212. Mutations of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin212, aux113, eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53 and gravity signaling6,7 cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, including ETO1, CTR1, EIN2, and EIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption of EIL1 and EIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35. In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression of OsERF82 in crw1 enhanced the expression of these ROS-related genes, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS in the root tip. Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, thereby reducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H2O2 inhibits vesicle-mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in crw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance ≥ 34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al.30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness30, change direction to avoid a flat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+ signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independent mechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth. Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics, and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors62.

Copyright notice ID: 12008199 PMID: 40251159 Abstract Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. Subject terms: Plant signalling, Tropism, Plant hormones This study demonstrated that amplified ethylene signaling impairs gravitropic growth of rice roots by affecting root cap stability and OsPIN2 polar localization, whereas mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling antagonizes ethylene signaling to safeguard gravitropism.Introduction The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18. Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling are induced by specific conditions or stresses, including flooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18. Ethylene signaling pathway starts with ethylene receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane19–21 and ends with gene regulation in the nucleus22–24. In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events25,26. When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethylene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil30. Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall composition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene36,37. However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing.Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1). Fig. 1. crw1 shows defective gravitropism when grown in water but not in soil.

The direction of each root tip was measured as the absolute value toward the direction of gravity.

WT and crw1 expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP grew in water or soil for two days. Scale bars are 1 cm in (a, d), 100 μm in (b, c, f, g) and 20 μm in (h). Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Plants were grown to maturity in two paddy fields. In one paddy field, no significant difference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. 4c–h), whereas in the other field there was a small and significant reduction in the percentage of filled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 4i–n). crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic The coiling phenotype of crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. 1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. 1c). When roots were placed horizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating impaired gravitropic response. Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11. To examine the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. 1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. 1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapid accumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it to grow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in the gravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells in crw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). Applying the auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root cap resulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VENUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). In Arabidopsis thaliana, symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward flow of auxin from the root tip12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter (pOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP) into WT and crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost in crw1 (Fig. 1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin distribution observed in crw1 root tips. When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and gravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these data suggest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxin distribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization.Cloning the causative gene of crw1 To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F1 plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and the F2 progeny segregated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio (χ2 = 0.002, P = 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomic resequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F2 progeny and identified three candidate genes, Os06g0604400, Os06g0605900, and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). Complementation tests identified Os06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identified in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of transcription (Fig. 2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The three oscrw1KO lines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and these defective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).

Significant difference from WT was determined by two-sided Student’s t-test. Scale bars are 1 cm in (e and c), 1 mm in (g), 200 μm in (h) and 20 μm in (i). The data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Analysis of transgenic plants expressing pOsCRW1::GFP and pOsCRW1::GUS showed that OsCRW1 was expressed in both roots and shoots (Fig. 2g, h and Supplementary Fig. 11). In roots, OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. 2g, h). Transient expression of p35S::GFP-OsCRW1 in rice protoplasts showed that OsCRW1 was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2i).Elevated ethylene response in crw1 when grown in hydroponic OsCRW1 encodes an F-box domain containing protein (OsEBF1), a homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 (AtEBF1)27,28. Recent studies showed that OsEBF1 and OsEBF2 negatively control ethylene signaling like AtEBF1 and AtEBF238, and loss of function of OsEBF1 or OsEBF2 led to a hypersensitivity of root and coleoptile to exogenous ethylene38, and a decreased resistance to brown planthopper in rice39,40. To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism was found (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). Knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affect the phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggesting that OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in root gravitropism. We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being significantly upregulated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. 3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 13). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescued the phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and root coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1KO lines in water (Fig. 3c–f), suggesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.The above findings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, like Arabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors27,28. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethylene signaling and targets of AtEBF141,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressing pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WT when grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared when grown in soil (Fig. 4a, b). WT roots grown in water, submerged paddy soil, vermiculite or soil-vermiculite mixture showed similarly low levels of OsEIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicative of similar levels of ethylene in these media. In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compacted soil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm−3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30 Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1) or OsEIL2 (oseil2KO/crw1) in crw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1. These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causing the root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger role than OsEIL2.

In (d, g), different letters above bars indicate a significant difference at P < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). In (k, l), significant difference from WT at *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, respectively (Student’s t-test, one-sided). Scale bars, 1 cm. Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, we overexpressed OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16-22- and 52-57-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). When grown in water, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c). Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotype resembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. In contrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition may repress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis43. When grown in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e).OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82 To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERF genes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phenotype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERF genes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERF genes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERF genes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERF genes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000) and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) were significantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and associated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supplementary Fig. 17d–f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82KO/crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 or OsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 could specifically bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in the OsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 in crw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the transcription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 to amplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water. The complete rescue of the crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved.OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed that genes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also enriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the root coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS-responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene (RBOHH) and four class III peroxidase genes were upregulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and functionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS fluorescent probe H2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramatically, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells (Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermiculite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed in the root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS46 and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death and sloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coiling phenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization.

Knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2, or OsERF82 in crw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore how enhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g0695400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC), GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG)47 (Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 specifically bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereas knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 in crw1 suppressed the upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d). Taken together, amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes.Mechanical resistance on the root tip rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 After identifying amplified ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impaired gravitropism in crw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 when plants were grown in water-saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig. 3). These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35-67 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 3a), which is 25-47 folds smaller than that in the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%) and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6 g cm−3 (i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al.30). To test the strength of mechanical resistance required to rescue the crw1 phenotype, we grew the mutant and WT in agar-solidified medium varying in the hardness by adding different amounts of agar (0.3 – 1.2%, mass/volume). crw1 showed root coiling in 0.3% and 0.4% agar media (penetration resistance 1 - 6 Pa) just as in water or nutrient solution (Supplementary Fig. 2b), curvy roots in 0.6% agar (penetration resistance 19 Pa), and normal straight roots in 0.8 – 1.2% agar (penetration resistance 34 – 77 Pa) (Fig. 6a–c). Similar phenotypic responses to different concentrations of agar (0.4%, 0.8% and 1.2%) were observed when crw1 plants were grown on the surface of vertical agar plates tilted at a 10° angle to allow the root tips in contact with varying degrees of mechanical resistance (Supplementary Fig. 22). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of ≥ 34 Pa is sufficient to rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1. Fig. 6. Gentle mechanical resistance on the root tip rescues the root coiling phenotype of crw1.

Data are means ± SD; n = 9 in (c) and 12 in (f). Different letters above bars indicate a significant difference at P < 0.05 (two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). Scale bars are 1 cm. Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1-mm diameter) to the root tip of crw1 grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig. 6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. The resistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to be approximately 104 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 23). The attachment of foam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin distribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribution and the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Fig. 6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism in crw1. Soil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth30. We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. 25). Increasing bulk density to 1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. 25). The larger inhibition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling.Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49. To investigate whether Ca2+ signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1, we expressed NES-YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a significantly higher [Ca2+]cyt signal than those growing in water, and there were no significant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cyt signal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased significantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥ 34 Pa enhances [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance. Fig. 7. Mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling antagonizes ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism in crw1.

Different letters above bars indicate a significant difference at P < 0.05 (two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). Scale bars are 1 cm in (g) and 100 μm in (a, c, e, f). Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+ signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1’s phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl3, a Ca2+ channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl3 suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps (Fig. 7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxin distribution (Fig. 7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl3 abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue of gravitropism in crw1. The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. 4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca2+ signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was suppressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μM LaCl3 to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps, resulting in an over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in the crw1 roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no significant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition of LaCl3 (Supplementary Fig. 28), suggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+ signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS production in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl3 to 0.8% agar medium significantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence of OsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 transcription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibits the amplified module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism.The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth phenotype when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230 rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower Yangtze River delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibited the root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respectively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. 30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of root coiling accessions had a significantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Addition of 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (Supplementary Fig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likely caused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotype recovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 30g).Discussion Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. Open in a new tab The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuring gravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator (https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html).The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212. Mutations of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin212, aux113, eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53 and gravity signaling6,7 cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, including ETO1, CTR1, EIN2, and EIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption of EIL1 and EIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35. In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression of OsERF82 in crw1 enhanced the expression of these ROS-related genes, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS in the root tip. Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, thereby reducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H2O2 inhibits vesicle-mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in crw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance ≥ 34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al.30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness30, change direction to avoid a flat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+ signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independent mechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth. Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics, and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signaling pathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil.Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2 s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agronomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of filled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity.Plasmid construction and plant transformation The CRISPR/Cas9 system63 was used to knock out OsCRW1 (Os06g0605900) and OsEBF2 (Os02g0200900) in the Zhonghua11 background and OsEBF2, OsEIL1 (Os03g0324200), OsEIL2 (Os07g0685700), OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000), and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) in the crw1 background. Two 20-bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) of each gene and cloned into two single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes of pYLgRNA-OsU6a and pYLgRNA-OsU6b by overlapping PCR, producing proU6a-T1-sgRNA and proU6b-T2-sgRNA fragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into the BsaI site of the pYLCRISPR-Cas9Pubi-H vector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs of proOsCRW1::OsCRW1, proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400 and proOs06g0619600::Os06g0619600, we amplified the promoter (1739 bp of proOsCRW1, 3 Kb of proOs06g0604400 and 3 Kb of proOs06g0619600) and the open reading frame (ORF) of OsCRW1, Os06g0604400 and Os06g0619600 from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the EcoRI/XbaI site of the pCAMBIAL1301 vector. To generate proOsCRW1::GFP constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from the pUN1301 vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the HindIII/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. To generate pOsCRW1::GUS constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced OsCRW1 promoter into the HindIII/BamHI site of the p1300 vector. To generate proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag and proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag constructs, we amplified the promoter (2588 bp of proOsEIL1, 2500 bp of proOsEIL2) and the full-length CDS (without the stop codon) of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the BamHI/SpeI site of the pTCK303 vector. To generate proUbi::OsEIL1 (OsEIL1-OX) and proUbi::OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) constructs, we amplified the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 or crw1 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation64. Transformants were verified by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Zhonghua11 expressing DR5rev::VENUS65, proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP14, or NES-YC3.665 were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressing proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag were crossed with crw1 or oscrw1KO lines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant background by PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments.Root growth experiments Germinated seeds were placed on a net floating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66 for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, and the pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutrients, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of crw1 and WT in hydroponic boxes filled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solution pH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), with or without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and 5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown in water and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH = 5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using a dissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was measured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of WT and crw1 in agar-solidified medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm) of WT and crw1 were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow vertically for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in the middle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionized water for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl3 (100 μM) were added to deionized water or agar medium according to different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 biological replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponic experiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experiments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments.MutMap-based gene cloning To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype of crw1, we backcrossed crw1 to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F1 progenies. F1 progenies were selfed to generate F2 progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F2 plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomic DNA of crw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 50× and 30× coverage for crw1 and WT, respectively), generating 150-bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWA software67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68. Causative variant were calculated using the MutMap SNP-index method69 and candidate SNPs were identified.Tissue expression pattern analysis of OsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GUS were grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durations for GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and other tissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C, transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed under an ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GFP were grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for fluorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP fluorescence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm for excitation.Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs of GFP-OsCRW1 or GFP-OsERF82 driven by the CaMV35S promoter (pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82), we amplified the full-length CDS of OsCRW1 or OsERF82 from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of the pSAT6-GFP-C vector. The fragments of pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82 were isolated from the pSAT6-GFP-C vector by PI-PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of the pRCS2 vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for transient expression70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at 505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nm and 360 nm for excitation, respectively.Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1% (w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded, sectioned according to a previous method71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol’s solution for 1 minute, washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope for the observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol’s stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KI solution.Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS Plants expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP or the reporter gene for auxin response (DR5rev::VENUS) or for cytosolic Ca2+ (NES-YC3.6, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP fluorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS fluorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement of cpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer according to a previous method50. The ECFP fluorescence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for excitation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively65.TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of root caps. Root tips were sampled and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solution (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively.Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1 and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGADT7 to generate the pGADT7-OsEIL1 and pGADT7-EIL2 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The pGBKT7-OsCRW1 plasmid and pGADT7-OsEIL1 or pGADT7-OsEIL2 plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs. pGBKT7-53 together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a positive control, and pGBKT7-lam together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on a double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal) for growth.Bimolecular fluorescence complementation The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was fused to the vector of pDONR221-P3P2, and the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 were fused to the vector of pDONR221-P1P4 by gateway cloning, and then were transferred into pBiFCt-2in1-NN vector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The final plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were infiltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after infiltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively.Western blot For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActin in the roots of WT and crw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteins were denatured by heating at 95 oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128, 1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence was performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Yeast one-hybrid The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGADT7 vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detect the binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter of OsERF82, we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBSmut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box (CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-boxmut, ACCACC; G-boxmut, AACTTG; DRE/CRTmut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control. pAbAi carrying different binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain to screen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibiting transcriptional self-activation. pGADT7 carrying OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 or OsERF82, and pAbAi carrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deficient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-deficient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth.Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET29a vector and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 to express OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His or OsERF82-His fusion protein. OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His and OsERF82-His fusion proteins were purified from E. coli by nickel affinity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence of OsERF82 or designed for the ERF-binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes to synthesize biotin-labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The protein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20 min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at 4 °C, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross-linking, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay The ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP™ ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plants of pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 were grown in water for two day, and 15-20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for each experiment. Root tissue was cross-linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde under vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and fragmented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200-500 bp, and 2% of the yield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1-DNA and OsEIL2-DNA complex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime, P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028, China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2 M) was added to the solution of protein-DNA complex and heated at 65 °C for 4 hours to remove the cross-linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform agent for DNA purification (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table 3) were designed near the three EBS sequences on the OsERF82 promoter. Primers and purified DNA were used for ChIP-qPCR.Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS of OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The pGBKT7-OsERF82 plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain. pGBKT7 plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Trp-deficient SD medium and double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X-α-gal) for growth.RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on roots of crw1 and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group contained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and read counts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on the number of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html).RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1 μg of total RNA to 20 μL cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an RT-PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). OsActin and OsHistone were used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2–Δ(ΔCt). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3.Statistics and reproducibility The experiments performed in this study were repeated independently at least three times with similar results. The data are presented as the mean ± SD and the microscope images presented are the most representative of the results. The significance of the difference between two sets of data was tested by one- or two-sided Student’s t-test using Microsoft Excel 2019. The difference among more than two sets of data was analyzed by one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test as post hoc analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (15.5MB, pdf) 41467_2025_59047_MOESM2_ESM.docx (11.8KB, docx) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Movie 1 (13.5MB, mp4) Reporting Summary (2.5MB, pdf) Transparent Peer Review file (619.8KB, pdf) Source data Source Data (6.3MB, xlsx) Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Chuanzao Mao of Zhejiang University for providing seeds of proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP and Dr. Wei Xuan of Nanjing Agricultural University for providing seeds of DR5rev::VENUS.

However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of root growth by cadaverine are largely unexplored.

Keywords: polyamines, cadaverine, biotin, root architecture, Arabidopsis thalianaSignificance Statement Cadaverine is a polyamine produced by plants and microbes, which has been shown to accumulate in plants under stress conditions and to inhibit primary root growth. Here, we show that cadaverine affects Arabidopsis root growth primarily by inhibiting the biotin biosynthesis pathway, thereby affecting primary metabolism and the lipid profile.INTRODUCTION Cadaverine (1,5‐diaminopentane) is a polyamine associated with environmental perception and modulation of biological processes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In plants, alterations in cadaverine levels induce changes in root architecture (Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991; Liu et al., 2014; Niemi et al., 2002; Strohm et al., 2015), fresh weight (Cassán, 2009; Tomar et al., 2013), and stress response (Aziz et al., 1998; Cassán, 2009; Kuznetsov et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2000; Shevyakova et al., 2001; Sziderics et al., 2010) with implications in crop yield and environmental stress resistance (reviewed in Jancewicz et al., 2016). Cadaverine is produced by decarboxylation of lysine in plastids (Bunsupa et al., 2012), a process that has been shown to be upregulated by environmental stresses, including heat, drought, and salt stress, in ice plant (Kuznetsov et al., 2007; Shevyakova et al., 2001), pepper (Sziderics et al., 2010), and maize (Simon‐Sarkadi et al., 2014). On the other hand, free cadaverine levels are below the limit of detection in Arabidopsis thaliana (Bunsupa et al., 2012; Shimizu et al., 2019). However, all plants can accumulate cadaverine directly from their environment, in the form of molecules secreted by microbes from the phyllosphere, rhizosphere or endosphere, or diffusing from decomposing matter (Cassán, 2009). Importantly, both endogenous cadaverine and exogenously applied cadaverine can modulate plant growth and environment‐related stress resistance (reviewed in Jancewicz et al., 2016). A. thaliana seedlings exposed to exogenous cadaverine display altered root‐growth behavior, clearly indicating a role for this compound in root‐growth regulation (Strohm et al., 2015). Similar to other polyamines, cadaverine catabolism produces hydrogen peroxide and other derived compounds, which serve as transducers in a variety of physiological, developmental, and environmental stress responses in animals, plants, and microbes. In Leguminosae, cadaverine is a precursor for quinolizidine alkaloids, which act to deter insects (Bunsupa et al., 2012). Much of the polyamine content within plant cells has been shown to be in the conjugated form (Torrigiani et al., 1987). Cadaverine can conjugate to lignin precursors, although other acceptors of conjugation are possible (Negrel et al., 1992). Despite these important roles of cadaverine in a broad aspect of plant development and physiology, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that modulate plant responses to cadaverine. To date, three cadaverine‐response genes have been identified in A. thaliana: OCT1, PAO4, and SPMS (Liu et al., 2014; Strohm et al., 2015). OCT1 encodes an organic cation transporter previously implicated in carnitine transport (Lelandais‐Brière et al., 2007; Strohm et al., 2015). PAO4, on the other hand, encodes a polyamine oxidase that functions in the back‐conversion of spermine into spermidine, and spermidine into putrescine (Liu et al., 2014). SPMS encodes a spermine synthase. To understand this process better, we carried out a forward genetic screen in A. thaliana, seeking mutations that affect root‐growth responses to exogenous cadaverine. This screen revealed biotin as a possible target for the cadaverine‐induced pathway. In addition, the named vitamin B7 or H, biotin is an essential cofactor that functions in carboxylation reactions associated with de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and amino acid homeostasis (Alban et al., 2000). In both plants and fungi, biotin synthesis starts with the conversion of pimeloyl‐coenzyme A (pimeloyl‐CoA) to 7‐keto‐8‐aminoperlargonic acid (KAPA), which is catalyzed by the cytosol‐ and peroxisome‐localized KAPA synthase enzyme (encoded by the BIO4 gene in Arabidopsis) (Pinon, 2005; Tanabe et al., 2011). Subsequent reactions occur in the mitochondria, and produce 7,8‐diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA), dethiobiotin (DTB), and finally biotin. These reactions are catalyzed by the DAPA synthase (BIO1), DTB synthase (BIO3), and biotin synthase (BIO2) enzymes, respectively (Cobessi et al., 2012; Muralla et al., 2007; Picciocchi et al., 2001; Shellhammer and Meinke, 1990). In plants and fungi, BIO1 and BIO3 form a bifunctional, homodimeric enzyme that is encoded by a single gene (Arabidopsis BIO3‐BIO1, At5G57590) (Muralla et al., 2007). In Arabidopsis, five carboxylases have been shown to use biotin as a cofactor: acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACCase; which catalyzes the first step in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis) (Sasaki et al., 1993; Yanai et al., 1995), 3‐methylcrotonyl‐CoA carboxylase (MCCase; which contributes to leucine catabolism) (Alban et al., 1993; Song et al., 1994), propionyl‐CoA carboxylase (an enzyme that functions at the intersection between fatty acid, amino acid, and sugar metabolism pathways) (Wurtele and Nikolau, 1990), geranoyl‐CoA carboxylase (Guan et al., 1999), and pyruvate carboxylase (a key contributor to gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis) (Wurtele and Nikolau, 1990; reviewed in Nikolau et al., 2003). A role for biotin beyond its function as a cofactor in carboxylases has also been suggested (Che, 2003), as has its potential contribution to the regulation of expression of defense‐related genes (Li et al., 2012). Furthermore, an uncharacterized nuclear‐localized biotinylated protein has also been identified as potential regulator of target gene expression (Li et al., 2012). In this work, we show that cadaverine modulates primary root growth, mainly, by altering the biotin metabolic pathway in A. thaliana. Cadaverine‐induced inhibition of root growth can be rescued with supplementation of biotin and biotin‐pathway intermediates downstream of BIO1. Furthermore, we observed that decreased biotinylation of ACCase subunit BCCP1, as a result of cadaverine treatment, leads to a reduction of fatty acid synthesis. This study will contribute toward understanding how biotin limitation affects plant growth, and the role of cadaverine as a natural biotin inhibitor.RESULTS cdh3 mutation enhances primary root growth sensitivity to cadaverine in Arabidopsis To identify molecular candidates in cadaverine response in plants, we carried out a forward genetic screen using a population of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)‐mutagenized A. thaliana plants in the Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) background. We screened M2 seedlings for altered root growth on media containing 200 µm cadaverine. One of the cadaverine‐hypersensitive mutants identified in this screen, named cadaverine hypersensitive 3 (cdh3), showed a significant inhibition of primary root growth on cadaverine‐containing media relative to wild type (Figure 1a and Figure S1). This mutant is the main subject of investigation in this manuscript. Figure 1. Open in a new tab cdh3 is hypersensitive to cadaverine (Cad). (a) 10‐day‐old Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) and cdh3 seedlings germinated on vertical plates containing 200 μm cadaverine or control media. (b) Dose–response of seedlings germinated on cadaverine media. Root growth between day 6 and 10 is quantified. Root growth on control media (average ± standard error): Col 2.29 ± 0.045 cm; cdh3 1.94 ± 0.096 cm. Whiskers represent minimum to maximum values. (c) Seedlings were germinated on 200 μm cadaverine or control media and treated with propidium iodide to stain the cell walls. Stained roots were then analyzed using confocal microscopy. Five seedlings were analyzed per treatment group. White stars indicate the quiescent center. White arrowheads indicate the end of the root meristem. (d) Length of the meristem was quantified by identifying cells in the cortex whose length is greater than the width, and measuring the distance from the distal wall this cell to the distal wall of the quiescent center. Bars represent standard error, with dots showing data points. (e) Numbers of cells in the meristems were counted from the quiescent center to the end of the meristem along the cortex. Bars represent standard error, with dots showing data points. (f) Root tip growth following transfer of 5‐day‐old seedlings from control to split agar plates containing either control media, or media supplemented with 200 μm cadaverine. Root tip growth was recorded using a high‐resolution camera for 96 h and quantified using ImageJ. Data points represent the three seedlings per treatment. Bars indicate standard error. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 analyzed by a mixed‐effects model with an F‐test for the interaction between time and treatment with Tukey’s adjustment for multiple comparisons. (g) cdh3 and wild‐type root growths were measured from day 6 to 10 on control or media supplemented with the indicated concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Root growths were standardized to growth on control media for each genotype. Whiskers show minimum to maximum values. ANOVA with Tukey's HSD correction was used to determine significance.Cadaverine decreases primary root growth earlier in the cdh3 mutant than the wild type To characterize cdh3 further, we first plated wild‐type and cdh3 mutant seeds on media containing cadaverine, ranging from 2 µm to 2 mm, and quantified primary root growth under these conditions. The results demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect of cadaverine at concentrations as low as 2 µm for cdh3, whereas a significant effect of cadaverine on wild‐type root growth was observed only at concentrations of 20 µm and higher (Figure 1b). At 20 µm cdh3 primary roots were 58.4% shorter than wild type. On control media lacking cadaverine, cdh3 seedlings showed only a minor decrease in primary root growth compared with wild type (Figure 1a). In previous work involving wild‐type Ler seedlings, Strohm et al. showed that exogenous cadaverine inhibits primary root growth mostly by affecting cell elongation (Strohm et al., 2015). They also demonstrated the existence of substantial natural variation between Arabidopsis accessions in their primary root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine (Strohm et al., 2015). Therefore, we tested the effects of exogenous cadaverine on wild‐type Col‐0, analyzing cell elongation and apical root meristem size. Eight‐day‐old seedlings were grown on 200 µm cadaverine or control media, and roots were treated with propidium iodide, a cell‐wall stain (Strohm et al., 2015), to determine cell sizes and zone boundaries in the root tip. The decrease in primary root growth was found to be mostly associated with alterations in cell size within the elongation zone (Figure S2), whereas the number of cells in the root apical meristem was not substantially affected in the wild type (Figure 1c–e). However, cdh3 showed a significantly smaller root meristem upon cadaverine treatment, while cdh3 grown on control media showed an equal number of cells compared with wild type. In addition to decreased cell division and cell expansion in cdh3, propidium iodide permeated a number of cells within the elongation zone, suggesting cell death (Figure 1c). We next wanted to determine the time at which cell elongation is modified following cadaverine treatment by measuring changes in tip growth over time. Five‐day‐old seedlings were transferred on to split agar plates containing control or 200 µm cadaverine media and imaged for 4 days using a high‐resolution camera. Wild‐type roots began to show a significant decrease in tip growth after 96 h of cadaverine treatment. cdh3, on the other hand, showed a decrease in root tip growth already 40 h after onset of cadaverine treatment (Figure 1f). Therefore, the cdh3 mutation substantially increases the speed of root‐tip response to exogenous cadaverine. Because arginine‐derived polyamines, such as putrescine and putrescine‐derived spermidine and spermine, were previously shown to also affect primary root growth in young Arabidopsis seedlings, we tested ability of cdh3 to respond to these polyamines as well (Liu et al., 2014; Strohm et al., 2015). The results demonstrated that cdh3 and wild type show similar root‐growth response to putrescine and spermine, with cdh3 showing only a mild resistance to 500 µm spermidine (Figure 1g). Hence, the cdh3 mutation increases root‐growth sensitivity to cadaverine, and it has little to no effect on root responses to putrescine and putrescine‐derived polyamines. Taken together, our data indicate that cdh3 alters a mechanism involved in the control of primary root growth in response to cadaverine, a process that targets the regulation of anisotropic cell expansion occurring in the main elongation zone as well as the meristem. cdh3’s enhanced cadaverine response is the result of a mutation in BIO3‐BIO1 To evaluate the genetic makeup of cdh3, we backcrossed it to Col‐0, and self‐pollinated the corresponding F1. Segregating F2 progeny were investigated for root‐growth sensitivity to cadaverine. Results showed 22.6% seedlings (12 of 53) exhibiting hypersensitive cadaverine response, consistent with a single, recessive mutation (chi‐squared value of 0.1179; P ˜ 0.3). To clone CDH3, we generated a pool of 162 cadaverine‐hypersensitive cdh3 F2 seedlings from this segregating population, extracted DNA from this pool, and subjected it to whole genome next‐generation sequencing. The candidate mutation was mapped to a 4.6 Mb region of chromosome 5, using the approach described in Schneeberger et al. (2009). Within this region, a non‐synonymous mutation was found within the BIO3‐BIO1 gene (At5G57590), which encodes a bifunctional enzyme involved in biotin synthesis (Cobessi et al., 2012). This mutation resulted in an A662T amino acid change within the BIO1 catalytic pocket of the protein (Figure 2a,b), which functions as an aminotransferase that catalyzes the conversion of KAPA into DAPA within the pathway. The A662 amino acid is located in close proximity to the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)‐cofactor binding site, potentially affecting enzymatic activity (Figure 2c). Figure 2. Open in a new tab cdh3 contains a mutation in BIO3‐BIO1. (a) Next‐generation sequencing revealed a peak on chromosome 5 with a high proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared with the reference sequence. Table shows mutations within the 4.6‐Mb peak region containing non‐synonymous SNPs in protein‐coding genes. (b) Gene structure for BIO3‐BIO1 is shown indicating the position of the SNP in cdh3. (c) 3D structure of the catalytic site of BIO1, deduced from the crystal structure resolved in Cobessi et al. (2012). This structure, imaged with pymol software, shows the substrate (7‐keto‐8‐aminoperlargonic acid [KAPA], in pink) and the cofactor (pyridoxal phosphate [PLP], in blue) bound to L666. Position of Ala662, which is converted into a threonine in cdh3, is indicated in yellow. (d) Quantification of standardized root growth on control and 200 μm cadaverine‐containing media from day 6 to 10 of wild‐type, cdh3, or cdh3 transformation–rescue lines (cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1]) with the wild type BIO3‐BIO1 transgene under the control of its native promoter. BIO3‐BIO1 rescue lines are at the T3 generation. Root growth on control media (average ± standard error): Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) 2.54 cm ± 0.045; cdh3 2.05 cm ± 0.073 cm; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 1 2.73 cm ± 0.075; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 2 2.37 cm ± 0.104 cm; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 3 2.36 cm ± 0.063 cm; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 4 2.53 cm ± 0.073 cm. Whiskers represent minimum to maximum. (e) Quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analysis of BIO3‐BIO1 in 8‐day‐old wild‐type, cdh3, and cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1] seedlings grown on control media. Bars represent standard error, with dots showing biological replicates. (d,e) Significant differences between groups detected using ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction (P < 0.05), are indicated with distinct letters.To confirm the association of the cadaverine‐hypersensitive phenotype of cdh3 with the A662T mutation in BIO3‐BIO1, we transformed a wild‐type BIO3‐BIO1 transgene under the control of its native promoter into cdh3. Four independent, homozygous transgenic lines (cdh3 [BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1]) were recovered and screened on cadaverine‐containing media. Results shown in Figure 2d demonstrated rescue of the cadaverine‐hypersensitive phenotype of cdh3 by the wild‐type BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1 transgene in all four independent lines. Furthermore, the transgene also rescued the decreased root‐growth phenotype displayed by cdh3 on control media, suggesting the corresponding A662T mutation in BIO3‐BIO1 was also responsible for cdh3 root‐growth restriction on control media (Figure 1a). While performing these transformation–rescue experiments, we also noted that three of the four transformation–rescue lines (lines 1, 3, and 4) displayed increased root‐growth resistance to cadaverine, a phenotype that is opposite to the hypersensitive response displayed by cdh3. To determine if the transformation–rescue lines displayed increased transgene expression level, BIO3‐BIO1 expression was quantified using reverse transcription (RT)‐quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on 8‐day‐old seedlings grown on control media. While no significant expression alterations were found between cdh3 and wild‐type seedlings, transformation–rescue lines displayed 4.5–14.8‐fold increases in BIO3‐BIO1 expression relative to wild type (Figure 2e). The level of root‐growth insensitivity to cadaverine correlated with increased expression in resistant transformation–rescue lines (R 2 = 0.68). Taken together, these results suggest dosage of BIO3‐BIO1 affects the root‐growth response to cadaverine.Cadaverine response is chemically suppressed by biotin Initial studies with the embryo‐lethal bio1‐1 mutant showed that knockout of biotin synthesis in plants can be rescued by application of exogenous biotin (Schneider et al., 1989). To determine if cdh3’s hypersensitive root‐growth response to cadaverine is the result of decreased biotin, we supplemented 200 μm cadaverine‐containing media with biotin at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 nm (Schneider et al., 1989). The cadaverine‐hypersensitive phenotype displayed by cdh3 roots was rescued in a dose‐dependent manner to near wild‐type root growth by addition of biotin (Figure 3a). In addition, the inhibitory effect of cadaverine on wild‐type root growth was also suppressed by addition of 80 nm biotin to the medium (Figure 3a). These data are compatible with cadaverine targeting the biotin pathway or modulating biotin availability or function. Alternatively, cadaverine and biotin could function through parallel pathways to modify primary root growth. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Biotin suppresses wild‐type primary root growth response to cadaverine (Cad) and rescues the hypersensitive root growth response of cdh3.

Whiskers show minimum to maximum values.To identify a step in the biotin synthesis pathway that may be potentially affected by cadaverine, we tested intermediate compounds of the biotin biosynthesis pathway for their abilities to suppress root‐growth response to cadaverine. Figure 3b shows that addition of 1 μm DAPA, the product of BIO1 activity, resulted in complete suppression of cadaverine's effects on root growth, whereas addition of 1 μm KAPA, the BIO1 substrate, did not. These results suggest that BIO2, BIO3, and BIO4 functions are not impaired by cadaverine. Rather, BIO1 enzymatic activity, channeling of DAPA to the BIO3 active site, or KAPA’s availability or transport, is/are inhibited by cadaverine. As root‐growth response to cadaverine can be alleviated by biotin supplementation in both cdh3 and wild‐type seedlings, we tested if we could identify cadaverine‐hypersensitive lines that cannot be rescued by biotin, thereby identifying downstream regulators in the cadaverine‐response pathway. ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 mutant, oct1‐1, and POLYAMINE OXIDASE 4 mutant, pao4‐1, have been shown to be hypersensitive to cadaverine (Liu et al., 2014; Strohm et al., 2015). oct1 and pao4 mutants were tested for chemical rescue on biotin‐ and cadaverine‐containing media. As shown in Figure 3c,d oct1 and pao4 mutant roots no longer displayed cadaverine hypersensitivity in the presence of biotin. Hence, biotin appears to function downstream of, or parallel to, OCT1 and PAO4 in the cadaverine‐response pathway.Cadaverine directly modulates biotin synthesis by altering BIO3‐BIO1 enzymatic activity As the results of the chemical rescue experiment suggest that cadaverine may target DAPA synthase, we expressed wild‐type BIO3‐BIO1 recombinant protein in vitro to test whether its enzymatic activity was fully functional upon cadaverine treatment. Previous in vitro studies by Cobessi et al., have shown that the product of the BIO1 reaction, DAPA, is channeled from the BIO1 active site to the BIO3 active site, and thus not released into the solution. Therefore, we chose to detect the product of BIO3, DTB using a FRET‐based competition assay, in which DTB will displace the lower affinity 4′‐hydroxyazobenzene‐2‐carboxylic acid quencher from fluorescently tagged avidin (Batchelor et al., 2007). We set up in vitro reactions in the presence or absence of cadaverine to determine whether cadaverine alters the enzyme activity. The result shown in Figure 4a indicates less formation of DTB in reactions containing cadaverine compared with control. The data suggest that cadaverine affects the flow of molecules through the biotin synthesis pathway at the level of DAPA or DTB synthesis, leading to decreased biotin synthesis and altered root growth. Attempts to express the cdh3 mutant protein in vitro were unsucessful, suggesting the A662T mutation may affect BIO3‐BIO1 protein stability. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Cadaverine (Cad) inhibits BIO3‐BIO1 enzymatic activity. (a) BIO3‐BIO1 enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity‐purified. In vitro enzymatic assays contained 50 μm cadaverine and 20 μm KAPA. A negative control assay was carried out with 0 μm KAPA with or without 50 μm cadaverine, to control for background fluorescence (see Experimental procedures). Reactions were run for 8 min before heat‐treating to stop the reaction. *P < 0.05 based on Student’s t‐test. Bars represent standard error, with individual data points showing biological replicates. DTB, dethiobiotin. (b) BIO3‐BIO1 expression is unaltered by cadaverine treatment. BIO3‐BIO1 expression was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction on cDNA prepared from RNA extracted from 8‐day‐old seedlings germinated on 200 μm cadaverine or control media, or transferred to cadaverine for 24, 48, or 72 h. Expression is standardized to PP2A reference gene. No statistically significant differences were observed using ANOVA. Bars represent standard error with values of individual biological replicates shown as symbols according to genotype and treatment indicated in the key. (c) BIO3‐BIO1 protein expression was quantified using a western‐blot approach. 8‐day‐old seedlings were grown on cadaverine‐containing media for 72 h. Proteins were extracted from whole seedlings and run on a sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Following electro‐transfer, the PVDF membrane was exposed to a BIO3‐BIO1‐specific antibody to determine protein level. An antibody directed against a proteasomal protein, RPT4A was also used as a loading control. Blot shown here is representative of three biological replicates that gave similar results. In each blot, band intensities were quantified and standardized to RPT4A for each lane. Results of these quantifications are plotted in the graph shown to the right of the blot, with the value of each biological replicate shown as a symbol indicated in the key. Bars indicate standard error. **P < 0.01 using Student’s t‐test against Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) on control condition. BIO3‐BIO1 transcript and protein are unaffected by cadaverine treatment To determine if cadaverine also affects the regulation of BIO3‐BIO1 expression, we next quantified the levels of BIO3‐BIO1 transcripts in control and cadaverine‐treated wild‐type and cdh3 seedlings. RNA was extracted from whole seedlings germinated on cadaverine‐containing media, or treated with cadaverine for 24, 48, or 72 h, along with controls grown on cadaverine‐free medium. No significant differences were identified between cadaverine‐treated and control samples, or between cdh3 and wild‐type seedlings (Figure 4b). In addition, cadaverine did not influence the expression of other biotin synthesis genes, BIO4 (At5G04620) and BIO2 (At2G43360) (Figure S3). This result contrasts with an earlier report that showed increased BIO2 expression upon biotin depletion (Patton et al., 1996). Together, these data suggest that cadaverine‐induced inhibition of biotin synthesis under our conditions is not sufficiently severe to result in increased BIO2 expression. To investigate a potential effect of cadaverine on BIO3‐BIO1 protein abundance, wild‐type, cdh3, and cdh3 [BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1] rescue line #2 were germinated and grown on either control or cadaverine‐containing media for 8 days. Proteins were extracted from dissected root and shoot tissues, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to Western blot analysis, probing with a BIO3‐BIO1‐specific antibody (Cobessi et al., 2012). The cdh3 [BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1] rescue line expressed increased amounts of BIO3‐BIO1 protein relative to wild type, irrespective of cadaverine treatment (Figure 4c), consistent with its increased BIO3‐BIO1 transcripts (Figure 2e). Minimal differences in relative BIO3‐BIO1 protein abundance were observed between cadaverine‐treated and control samples for all genotypes and tissues tested (Figure 4c), suggesting that cadaverine has limited impacts on overall expression of the BIO3‐BIO1 protein in Arabidopsis.Cadaverine treatment decreases the biotinylation of biotin carboxyl carrier proteins in planta Considering that cadaverine inhibits biotin synthesis, we hypothesized that treating Arabidopsis seedlings with cadaverine should result in decreased biotinylation of target proteins in plant tissues. Previous studies have shown that probing Western blot membranes with a streptavidin probe allows the detection of a minimum of three biotinylated plant proteins, including MCCA, involved in amino acid metabolism, and the biotin carboxyl carrier protein 1 and 2 subunits (BCCP1 and BCCP2) of chloroplastic, heterodimeric ACCase, involved in fatty acid metabolism (Aubert et al., 1996; Che, 2003; Li et al., 2012). BCCP2 is primarily expressed in flowers and developing seeds, but scarcely detectable in seedling tissues (Thelen et al., 2001). We used a similar Western blot analysis to determine whether cadaverine treatment is sufficient to induce differences in MCAA and/or BCCP proteins biotinylation in dissected root and/or shoot tissues. Wild‐type, cdh3, and cdh3 [BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1] #2 rescue seedlings were germinated and grown on control or cadaverine‐containing media for 8 days. Roots and shoots were then dissected. Proteins extracted from these samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using a streptavidin probe. The amounts of biotinylated MCCA protein showed little change upon cadaverine treatment in the root (Figure 5a,c) or shoot (Figure 5b,d). On the other hand, a decrease in biotinylated BCCP1 protein was observed in both roots (Figure 5a,e) and shoots (Figure 5b,f), with a larger magnitude of decrease occurring in the roots. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Levels of biotinylated proteins are altered following cadaverine (Cad) treatment. (a,b) Seed were germinated on control or cadaverine‐containing media. Following 8 days of treatment, roots (a) and shoots (b) were dissected and protein was extracted. 150 µg of protein were loaded on to sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed. After electro‐transfer on to a PVDF membrane, biotinylated proteins were detected with Licor IRDye CW800‐labeled streptavidin or anti‐biotin carboxyl carrier protein (anti‐BCCP) 1 and 3‐methylcrotonyl‐CoA carboxylase (MCCA) antibodies. In all cases, anti‐RPT4A antibodies were used to control for loading differences between samples. Blots shown in (a,b) are representative of three biological replicates showing similar results. Quantifications of band intensities from these blots are summarized in (c–f) for all three biological replicates. (c–f) Protein amount and biotinylation were quantified based on band intensity, standardized to the RPT4A signals, and then standardized again to Columbia‐0 (Col‐0). Expression results shown in the graphs represent three biological replicates, with a circle or square indicating the value of each control or cadaverine replicate, respectively. Bars indicate standard error. *Student's t‐test P < 0.05. **P < 0.01, compared with Col‐0 control treatment. (c) MCCA total protein and MCCA biotinylation in roots. (d) MCCA total protein and biotinylation in shoots. (e) BCCP1 total protein and BCCP1 biotinylation in roots. (f) BCCP1 total protein and BCCP1 biotinylation in shoots.Cadaverine‐induced changes in biotinylated protein abundance could be due to decreased levels of target protein biotinylation, and/or relate to changes in abundance of the corresponding proteins. To investigate these possibilities, we used MCCA‐ and BCCP1‐specific antibodies to analyze the abundance of these proteins in control and cadaverine‐treated seedlings. Results shown in Figure 5c demonstrated increased MCCA levels in the root upon cadaverine treatment only in cdh3, while no significant changes were observed in the shoot (Figure 5d). BCCP1 protein abundance in cadaverine‐treated samples relative to controls, showed no significant changes in the root or shoot (Figure 5e,f). qRT‐PCR analysis of MCCA and BCCP1 expression showed no significant transcriptional alteration in cdh3 and Col‐0 upon cadaverine treatment, whether applied since germination, or for 24, 48, or 72 h (Figure S4). Taken together, our data are consistent with cadaverine treatment leading to decreased biotin synthesis, thereby resulting in decreased biotinylation in BCCP1 protein in both shoots and roots. They are also consistent with decreased biotinylation levels of MCCA protein in cdh3 mutant roots, as increased MCCA apoprotein abundance is not accompanied by increased levels of biotinylated MCCA (Figure 5c). In summary, cadaverine treatment significantly affects the amount of biotinylated BCCP1 protein in both shoots and roots.Lipid composition is altered by cadaverine ACCase requires biotinylation of the BCCP1 subunit to generate malonyl‐CoA from acetyl‐CoA at the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis. The cadaverine‐induced reduction in biotinylated BCCP1 protein in plant tissues is expected to decrease fatty acid production. To test this hypothesis, we determined the impact of cadaverine treatment on the lipid profile of Arabidopsis seedlings. Wild‐type Col‐0 seeds were germinated and grown on control media for 5 days, then transferred to either control media or media containing 200 µm cadaverine, and allowed to grow for 72 more hours, a time previously determined to be sufficient to allow primary root growth inhibition by cadaverine (Figure 1). At that time, lipids were extracted from these samples, and subjected to lipidomics analyses by tandem mass spectrometry (Shiva et al., 2013). Total polar lipids as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids, were analyzed with five biological replicates. The results showed that total TAG decreased in abundance upon cadaverine treatment, with six of 31 TAG species showing significant decreases (Figure 6), all of which were TAGs having 18:3 acyls. On the other hand, TAGs containing short‐chain fatty acids, 16:0 and 16:1, had little changes with the treatment (Figure 6). The reduced TAG synthesis along with the higher percentage of short‐chain fatty acid compositions in TAGs were also previously observed in Arabidopsis plants with limited biotin availability (Pommerrenig et al., 2012). Therefore, these results are consistent with the negative effect of cadaverine on biotin availability and TAG production. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Triacylglycerol content following 72 h of cadaverine (Cad) treatment. Columbia‐0 seedlings were germinated on control media and transferred to either control or 200 μm cadaverine‐containing media after 5 days. 72 h post‐treatment, whole seedlings were harvested and used for lipid extraction and analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. The average of five biological replicates are shown containing approximately 200 seedlings per replicate, with dots representing each replicate. Bars indicate standard error. Student’s t‐test was done to determine significance between cadaverine treatment and control. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01.We observed similar levels of total polar lipid species between cadaverine‐treated and control seedlings, with slight decreases observed in total PA and phosphatidylinositol (PI), and an increase in phosphatidylcholine (PC) (Table S1). Although total DAG levels were not altered by cadaverine treatment, specific DAGs changed in abundance in response to cadaverine, including increases in DAG 16:0/16:1, DAG 18:0/16:2 and DAG 18:3/dnOPDA, and decreases in DAG 18:3/18:3 content (Table S1). In addition, we have also seen modification of phospholipids, albeit below the significance threshold, with PI and PA decreasing with cadaverine treatment.DISCUSSION We have shown that cadaverine functions to inhibit primary root growth by modulating biotin synthesis through inhibition of the BIO3‐BIO1 enzyme. Cadaverine response can be chemically rescued with biotin, DAPA, but not KAPA. While KAPA could potentially be excluded from transport into seedlings, the results of our in vitro reaction show cadaverine to inhibit BIO3‐BIO1 activity. Furthermore, cadaverine did not alter the expression of BIO3‐BIO1 at the protein level in wild‐type or cdh3, and overexpression of BIO3‐BIO1 from our cdh3 rescue line resulted in increased BIO3‐BIO1 protein and resistance to cadaverine, in agreement with an effect on BIO3‐BIO1 enzymatic function. Analysis of the BIO3‐BIO1 mutant, cdh3, reported here shows biotin deficiency results in decreased primary root growth, which is similar to the phenotype observed in the hypomorphic mutation in BIO4 (Li et al., 2012). Furthermore, analysis of cdh3 root growth on cadaverine‐containing media also shows evidence of cell death in the elongation zone upon staining with propidium iodide (Figure 1c). Evidence of cell death was also reported in shoots of a hypomorphic mutant of BIO4 (Li et al., 2012), indicating that decreases in biotin cause cell death in both roots and shoots. The localization of cell death to the elongation zone of cadaverine‐treated cdh3 may reflect an increased requirement for biotin in tissues that undergo rapid cell growth and expansion. Alternatively, deficiencies in fatty acid synthesis have been shown to result in an accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria, along with cell death (Wu et al., 2015). The similar phenotypes observed in cadaverine‐treated cdh3 mutant seedlings (this study) and biotin‐deficient mutants (Li et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015) thus suggest that a deficiency in biotin synthesis may underlie the developmental impact of cadaverine. Inhibition of biotin synthesis has long been a target for herbicides and antibiotics. While numerous compounds have been identified to inhibit biotin biosynthesis, to date only one natural product, amiclenomycin, had been identified to inhibit DAPA synthase in bacteria, through formation of a covalent adduct with PLP (Sandmark et al., 2002). Our results indicate cadaverine is a natural DAPA synthase inhibitor in Arabidopsis. Cadaverine may function to inhibit BIO3‐BIO1 through formation of a Schiff base with PLP, as observed with amiclenomycin, or through direct interaction with the binding site. BIO3‐BIO1 inhibition by cadaverine cannot be mimicked by treatments with putrescine and/or putrescine‐derived polyamines. The different inhibitory activities displayed by distinct polyamines may be determined by charge distribution of the amine groups or subcellular compartmentalization. Given the proximity of A662 to PLP, the hypersensitive response of cdh3 mutant to cadaverine could be explained by an altered conformation of the mutant protein resulting in decreased reaction efficiency. However, multiple attempts at producing recombinant cdh3 mutant enzyme failed, preventing us from directly testing this hypothesis. Future work will be aimed at characterizing cadaverine’s inhibitory effect on DAPA synthase activity in plants. As we have shown exogenous biotin rescues the cadaverine response phenotype, the effect of cadaverine treatment on primary root growth is in part associated with induced alterations in lipid composition, including decreased TAG content, and/or signaling phospholipids. Analysis of SUC5, required for biotin transport into the developing embryo from the maternal plant, shows the suc5 and bio1 or bio2 double mutants rescued with exogenous biotin have an increased proportion of short chain fatty acids (16:0 and 16:1), in accordance with our observation of cadaverine treatment (Figure 6; Table S1) (Pommerrenig et al., 2012). The decrease in PI and PA could be due to increased activity through the phosphoinositide pathway to generate DAG to compensate for decreases in TAG. Alternatively, cadaverine may function to affect the components of the phosphoinositide pathway, independently from its effect on biotin, contributing to the root growth phenotype we see in response to cadaverine. Biotin is also involved in amino acid homeostasis, gluconeogenesis, and other aspects of central metabolism. MCCase has previously been shown to accumulate in response to biotin depletion or starvation to allow for recycling of amino acids (Aubert et al., 1996; Che, 2003; Ding et al., 2012). The increase of MCCA apoprotein in cdh3 (Figure 5a,c) is compatible with a mechanism that allows modulation of target MCCA protein abundance by biotin availability, in agreement with previous studies (Che, 2003; Li et al., 2012). The absence of such changes in cadaverine‐treated wild‐type plants may simply reflect a lower level of biotin limitation in wild‐type roots. While root growth inhibition of cdh3 was not observed with putrescine‐derived polyamines (Figure 1g), the pao4 phenotype and subsequent rescue by biotin (Figure 3d) suggests a connection between cadaverine and the putrescine‐derived polyamines. Polyamine oxidases, such as PAO4, oxidize polyamines spermidine and spermine, thereby contributing to putrescine‐derived polyamines homeostasis (Kamada‐Nobusada et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2014). pao4 mutants show increased spermine content, decreased spermidine and hydrogen peroxide, and changes in primary metabolism (Sequera‐Mutiozabal et al., 2016). Altered primary metabolism associated with the pao4 mutation may reflect an indirect role for the putrescine‐derived polyamines or their catabolic products in biotin synthesis or the downstream effects of biotin. The putrescine‐derived polyamines are essential components for growth and development; for example, thermospermine is required for vasculature development in Arabidopsis (Kakehi et al., 2008) and spermidine is required for eukaryotic translation (Park et al., 1982). Studies on the functions of putrescine‐derived polyamines have been hampered by the embryo lethality associated with spermidine depletion (Imai et al., 2004). Therefore, it is possible that putrescine‐derived polyamines provide other essential roles that have yet to be uncovered. OCT1 has been characterized as a carnitine transporter and was proposed to transport cations, such as polyamines (Lelandais‐Brière et al., 2007; Strohm et al., 2015). In mammals the carnitine cycle allows acyl transport into the mitochondria for beta‐oxidation. An analogous mechanism has been proposed in plants after identification of a carnitine acyl carrier‐like protein with homology to mammalian carnitine acyl carrier, but the role of carnitine in plants has yet to be further elucidated (Lawand et al., 2002). oct1 mutants could be sensitive to cadaverine because of altered polyamines homeostasis and/or localization. Alternatively, cadaverine‐induced lipid deficiency could be exacerbated by altered acyl transport capabilities in the oct1 mutants. In some plants, cadaverine abundance has been found to increase in response to environmental stress, a process that is believed to contribute to stress mitigation. Furthermore, microbes from the phyllosphere, rhizosphere, or endosphere have also been shown to provide plants with cadaverine, as does decomposing matter in proximity of a root system (Cassán, 2009). Both endogenous and exogenously applied cadaverine can modulate plant growth and environment‐related stress resistance (reviewed in Jancewicz et al., 2016). We present here that cadaverine inhibits biotin biosynthesis and primary metabolism in Arabidopsis through direct inhibition of DAPA synthase, thereby reducing the accumulation of TAGs. If the physiological responses to cadaverine are adaptive, the presence of cadaverine, either through association with microbes (in most plants including A. thaliana) or through stress‐induced synthesis, where observed, may serve to divert a plant’s resources from growth to defense responses. Future investigations addressing the conservation of cadaverine‐response pathways in plants, and the development of methods aimed at better controlling the effects of cadaverine on biotin synthesis, its impact on primary metabolism within the biomass, and on root‐system architecture, should yield important new insights, facilitating the development of new crop varieties with improved productivity, enhanced energy content of the biomass, and increased adaptability to the stresses associated with climate change or growth on marginal lands.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Seedling root growth measurements Seedlings were grown on plates containing 1.5% agar, 0.5× Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) media pH 5.7 with 1.5% sucrose unless otherwise noted. After 48 h of stratification, plates were moved to a 22°C growth chamber under long day conditions, 60 μmol m–2 sec–1 white light (cool‐white fluorescent bulbs) and the wave assay was carried out as described in Rutherford and Masson (1996). Day lengths were 16 h. After 6 days of growth, the position of the root tip was marked and seedlings were grown for 4 more days. After 10 days, plates were scanned using a document scanner and the growth from Day 6 to 10 was measured using the Neuron J plugin of ImageJ. Root growth was standardized to the control of each mutant line. To determine if the response was specific to cadaverine, mutant lines were screened on media supplemented with putrescine (5, 10, and 15 mm), spermidine (300, 500, and 700 μm), and spermine (200, 300, and 400 μm), and root growth measurements were carried out as described above.Meristem morphology and cell size Zeiss confocal LSM780 microscope was used to characterize cell size and morphology of cadaverine‐treated roots. Eight‐day‐old seedlings were germinated on control media or 200 μm cadaverine‐containing media. Seedlings were grown as described above. After 8 days in the growth chamber, seedlings were stained with 1.0 mg ml–1 propidium iodide for approximately 2 sec and then rinsed with water. Roots were imaged using a 561‐nm laser, 20× objective. Images were analyzed using ImageJ. Meristem was defined from the quiescent center to the first elongated cell in the cortex. The number of cells in the meristem was counted from the quiescent center along files of cortical cells to the first elongated cell (Perilli et al., 2010). The cell length in the mature zone was quantified by measuring cells in the epidermis using ImageJ.Root tip growth measurement Seedlings were germinated on control media (as above) and grown vertically to reduce waving. Three days after germination, seedlings were transferred to control or 200 μm cadaverine‐containing media and grown under 60 μmol m–2 sec–1 of continuous light. A high‐resolution raspberry pi camera was used to image seedlings every 8 h. Imaging began within 10 min after transfer. ImageJ was used to measure tip growth every 8 h. Statistical difference in root tip growth between cadaverine and control treatment was tested using a mixed effects model with an F‐test for the interaction between time and treatment, corrected with Tukey’s adjustment for multiple comparisons in SAS Studio Version 3.8 (Gueorguieva and Krystal, 2004).Forward genetic screen To generate an EMS population, approximately 0.19 g of Col‐0 seeds (M0) were treated with 50 ml of 0.2% EMS for 15 h, then rinsed with water eight times (Weigel and Glazebrook, 2002). On the last wash, seeds were soaked in water for an hour. Seeds were then resuspended in 0.1% agar and pipetted on to soil. After EMS application M0 seeds are referred to as M1. M1 plants were self‐pollinated and M2 seeds were collected in individual pools for each plant. In total, 1064 M2 lines were screened on plates containing LS media supplemented with 200 μm cadaverine. Seedlings showing a hypersensitive response, a decrease in root growth compared with the wild type on cadaverine media, were self‐pollinated and the M3 lines were rescreened on 200 μm cadaverine and control media. Root growth of these M3 lines was quantified as described above. Student’s t‐test was done against Col‐0 to determine if the mutant line was hypersensitive to cadaverine (Figure S1).Next‐generation sequencing A mapping population of cdh3 was generated by backcrossing cdh3 to wild‐type Col‐0. The segregating F2 population was screened on 50 μm cadaverine plates as described above, omitting sucrose. In total, 162 cadaverine hypersensitive seedlings were pooled and frozen in liquid nitrogen, then homogenized with a 4.5‐mm steel bead using Mixmill. DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Next‐generation sequencing was done using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (UW‐Biotech Facility) with 100 bp, paired‐end reads. dnastar software (version 12.3) was used for alignment and variant identification. Reads with a Q value <30 were removed from analysis. Variants present in multiple EMS mutant lines and Col‐0 were subtracted from the cdh3 variant list. The location of the mutation was identified by looking at the percentage single nucleotide polymorphism along the position in the genome (Zuryn et al., 2010).Chemical rescue Seedlings were germinated on LS media with or without 200 μm cadaverine and 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 nm biotin. Biotin was prepared as described in Schneider et al. (1989). Seedling root growth was quantified as described above. Student’s t‐test was done to determine significance against Col‐0 using P < 0.05 as a cut off.Transformation rescue Primers containing adapters for Asc1 and Pac1 restriction sites were used to amplify Col‐0 wild‐type BIO3‐BIO1 genomic DNA (At5G57590), from 1233 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site to 382 bp 3′ of the stop codon, yielding a 5706‐bp product. The PCR reaction was restriction‐digested with Asc1 and Pac1 and ligated into pMDC99 (Curtis, 2003). The ligated product was transformed into Escherichia coli DUO competent cells (Lucigen, Middleton, WI, USA) and selected on 50 μg ml–1 kanamycin. Transformation rescue was done on the cdh3 mutant using the floral dip method as described (Clough and Bent, 1998) using Agrobacteria strain GV3101. T1 seeds were screened on 50 μg ml–1 hygromycin to identify positive transformants.Protein expression and isolation Protein expression of pET‐mBIO3‐BIO1 was carried out as described previously (Cobessi et al., 2012). The plasmid was introduced into Rosetta‐2 E. coli competent cells (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) and cultured overnight at 37°C, 200 r.p.m. in 10 ml LB medium containing 50 μg ml–1 kanamycin. After overnight growth the culture was transferred into 500 ml LB with appropriate antibiotic and supplemented with 10 μm pyridoxine and 15 μm thiamin (Cobessi et al., 2012). The culture was incubated at 37°C until the OD600 reached 0.3. At this point, 0.4 mm isopropylthio‐β‐d‐galactoside was added, and the culture was grown for 16 h at 18°C, shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were then harvested by centrifuged at 4°C for 20 min at 4000 g . Pellet was resuspend in lysis buffer with additional 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and 500 μm PLP. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatant was collected and subjected to QIAexpress Ni‐NTA column purification (Qiagen). Eluted protein was desalted using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units, Ultra‐15 MWCO 50 kDa (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA). Protein was stored and diluted in 100 mm HEPPS pH 8.6.BIO3‐BIO1 in vitro enzymatic assay The assay was modified from the method developed by Cobessi et al. (2012). Reaction buffer contained the following: 100 mm HEPPS pH 8.6, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm AdoMet, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 0.3 mm ATP. Each reaction included various concentrations of racemic hydrochloride‐KAPA (synthesized according to the procedure described by Nudelman et al. (2004) as substrate (0 or 20 µm), along with 0 or 50 µm cadaverine dihydrochloride. The BIO3‐BIO1 enzyme at a final concentration of 6.9 µm was added to start the reactions. Reactions were run at 25°C for 8 min. At the end of each reaction, the enzyme was inactivated by addition of 20% acetic acid. Inactivated enzyme was removed from the reaction using a 10‐kDa column (Pall NanoSep). DTB was detected using FluoReporter Biotin Quantitation Assay Kit (F30751; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Twenty‐five microliters of reaction product was mixed with 25 µl 2× Biotective Green Reagent and incubated for 5 min in the dark before detection using a Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro microplate reader with 495 nm (10 nm bandwidth) excitation and 530 nm (10 nm bandwidth) emission. A standard curve of DTB was generated from 0 to 80 pmol and used to determine the amount of DTB per sample.Seedling growth for gene expression analysis Seedlings were germinated on control media and transferred to plates containing control or 200 μm cadaverine media for 24, 48, or 72 h before collecting tissue at 8 days after germination. An additional subset of seedlings was germinated directly on control or 200 μm cadaverine media. To harvest, seedlings were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized using a 4.5‐mm steel bead and a Mixmill.Gene expression analysis RNA extraction was done using TRIzol reagent and Direct‐zol RNA MiniPrep Kit, with a chloroform phase separation, according to manufacturer’s specifications (ZymoResearch, Irvine, CA, USA). cDNA synthesis was done using SuperScript III. qRT‐PCR was done using Bullseye EvaGreen qPCR Mastermix (MidSci) and run on a LightCycler 480 II Instrument (Roche). Gene expression was calculated by the delta delta C t method and standardized to the PP2A (At1G59830) reference gene (Czechowski et al., 2005; Ramakers et al., 2003). Fold‐change of expression for all samples was then set relative to a control sample. Statistical significance was identified by ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction (SAS version 9.3).Protein analysis Seedling growth is as described above, with seedlings germinated on 1.5% agar, 0.5× LS media pH 5.7 with 1.5% sucrose with or without or 200 μm cadaverine. Tissue was frozen using dry ice after 8 days of growth. Frozen samples were homogenized using MixMill. Protein was extracted in the equivalent of 1 ml of protein extraction buffer (20 mm MOPS [pH 7.5], 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 50 mm Sucrose [Roche inhibitor cocktail tablet], 1 mm DTT, 7% glycerol [adapted from (Li et al., 2012]) per 250 mg of tissue. The homogenate was gently mixed at 4°C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min, 18 000 g to pellet the debris. Total protein was quantified and standardized for each gel using the Roche BCA assay. Approximately 150 μg of protein was loaded on to a 12% Tris‐Bis NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and run using the Invitrogen X‐cell SureLock Mini‐Cell Electrophoresis System. After electroblotting, the Immunobilon‐FL PVDF membrane was blocked for 1 h at 4°C with a 5% milk/TBS solution (25 mm Tris‐HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 3.0 mm KCl). Anti‐RPT4A, a proteasome subunit‐specific antibody generated in rabbit, was used as a loading control at 1:4000 dilution. BIO3‐BIO1 antibody was generated against guinea pig by Claude Alban and used at 1:25 000 (Cobessi et al., 2012). BCCP1 and MCCA antibodies were generated against rabbit by Basil Nikolau and obtained from the Plant Antibody Facility (PAF, Ohio State) (Che, 2003; Li et al., 2011). MCCA and BCCP1 antibodies were used at a concentration of 1:10 000. LiCor CW800, secondary antibodies were used according to manufacturer’s instructions at 1:10 000 dilution. Membranes were scanned using LICOR Odyssey. Image studio software version 5.2.5 and Adobe Photoshop was used to quantify band intensity.Biotin‐containing protein analysis Biotin‐containing proteins were quantified following protocol from Li et al. (2012). RPT4A loading control was used as described above. Membranes were blocked in TBST with 1% Tween20 before treating with streptavidin. Streptavadin CW800 was used to detect biotinylated proteins at a concentration of 0.5 µg ml–1 in 1% milk TBST.Lipid profiling Col‐0 wild‐type seedlings were grown on LS media as described above. After 5 days in the growth chamber, seedlings were transferred to plates containing control or 200 μm cadaverine media, and allowed to grow for an additional 72 h. Fresh tissue was submerged immediately in 75°C isopropanol with 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene. Lipid extraction procedure was done according to Devaiah et al. (2006). Samples were dried under nitrogen gas and shipped to Kansas State Lipidomics Research Center for analysis (Vu et al., 2014). Lipids were standardized to dry weight for each sample. Total acyl lipids, DAG and TAG were analyzed on a Waters Xevo TQS mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Samples contained 200 seedlings per biological replica, with a total of five biological repeats.ACCESSION NUMBERS Sequence data from this article can be found in the EMBL/GenBank data libraries under accession numbers: BIO3‐BIO1 (AT5G57590), BIO2 (AT2G43360), BIO4 (AT5G04620), MCCA (AT1G03090), BCCP1 (AT5G16390), PAO4 (AT1G65840), OCT1 (AT1G73220), PP2A (AT1G69960), and RPT4A (AT5G43010).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS NMG, HAM, and PHM designed the research; NMG, S‐HS, SL‐N, SM, and CA performed the research; NMG, S‐HS, SL‐N, HAM, and PHM analyzed the data; NMG and PHM wrote the paper.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Supporting information Figure S1. Thirteen cadaverine hypersensitive mutants (cdh1–cdh13) were identified by screening for alterations in root responses to cadaverine. Root growth from day 6 to day 10 was measured on cadaverine and control media. Each mutant line was standardized to growth on control media, and standardized again to growth of the wild type. cdh mutants 1–7 fall into distinct complementation groups. Other mutants were not included in this genetic complementation test. Bars indicate standard error. ***P < 0.001 as determined by Student’s t‐test. Whiskers indicate minimum to maximum values. Figure S2. Cadaverine decreases cell elongation. (a) Seedlings were germinated on 200 μM cadaverine or control media and propidium iodide treatment was used to stain the cell walls. Stained roots were then analyzed using confocal microscopy. Five seedlings were analyzed per treatment group. Cell length in the mature zone was analyzed using the same treatment conditions described in Figure 1. (b) Length of epidermal cells in the mature zone was quantified for each treatment described in (a). Statistical differences were defined by ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction with similar letters indicating no statistical difference. Bars represent standard error. Figure S3. Expression of genes involved in biotin synthesis is unaffected by cadaverine treatment. Wild‐type and cdh3 seeds were germinated on control media, with a subset germinated on media containing 200 μM cadaverine.

    "abstract": "Abstract Clinostats are instruments that continuously rotate biological specimens along an axis, thereby averaging their orientation relative to gravity over time. Our previous experiments indicated that low-speed clinorotation may itself trigger directional root tip curvature. In this project, we have investigated the root curvature response to low-speed clinorotation using Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedlings as models. We show that low-speed clinorotation triggers root tip curvature in which direction is dictated by gravitropism during the first half-turn of clinorotation. We also show that the angle of root tip curvature is modulated by the speed of clinorotation. Arabidopsis mutations affecting gravity susception (pgm) or gravity signal transduction (arg1, toc132) are shown to affect the root tip curvature response to low-speed clinorotation. Furthermore, low-speed vertical clinorotation triggers relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the lateral membrane of Arabidopsis root cap statocytes, and creates a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. Together, these observations support a role for gravitropism in modulating root curvature responses to clinorotation. Interestingly, distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display different abilities to develop root tip curvature responses to low-speed vertical clinorotation, suggesting the possibility of using genome-wide association studies to further investigate this process.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Most plants use gravitropism to guide the growth of their organs, directing primary roots vertically downward into the soil, primary shoots upward above ground, and secondary organs laterally, at an angle from the vertical named the gravity set point angle (GSA), to effectively explore their immediate surroundings. Overall, this process contributes to a plant’s ability to anchor itself into the soil, actively seek water and nutrients within its growth substrate, exchange gases, photosynthesize, and reproduce. Consequently, gravitropism is a key environmental response that allows plants to thrive under diverse environmental conditions, thereby contributing to plant fitness and productivity in their natural ecological niches as well as in agricultural settings. Gravitropism is composed of several successive phases that include gravity susception, believed to involve the sedimentation of heavy starch-filled plastids (amyloplasts, also named statoliths) in specialized cells (the statocytes) located in the starch sheath of shoots and in the columella cells of the root cap. This is followed by transduction into a biochemical signal through a process that remains largely unexplained, the formation of an auxin gradient across the gravistimulated organ, transmission of the gradient to the site of response, and differential cell elongation on opposite flanks of the organ, leading to a curvature response, usually upward for shoots and downward for roots (reviewed in [1]). The molecular mechanisms underlying the initial phases of gravity sensing and signal transduction in the statocytes remain largely unknown. However, this process leads to a fast cytoplasmic alkalinization of the statocytes upon gravistimulation, accompanied by a change in polarity of the cell associated with the transcytotic relocalization of the auxin efflux facilitators PIN3 and PIN7 to the new bottom membrane [2,3,4,5]. This relocalization is dependent upon the proper functioning of key regulators in the statocytes, including ALTERED RESPONSE TO GRAVITY 1 (ARG1) and its paralog ARG1-like 2 (ARL2) [6,7], MODIFIER OF arg1 1 (MAR1/TOC75) and MAR2/TOC132 [8], LAZY, RCC1-LIKE DOMAIN (RLD) [9,10,11], and ADENOSINE KINASE 1 (ADK1) [12]. Additionally, mutations in genes that encode enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis, such as pgm-1, affect gravitropism mostly by decreasing the density of statocyte amyloplasts, thereby affecting gravity susception [13]. Finally, PIN protein phosphorylation at conserved Ser residues has been shown to also modulate PIN3 relocalization in the statocytes and its auxin transport activity (reviewed in [14]). In roots, PIN3 and PIN7 relocalization in the upper layers of columella cells in the root cap upon plant reorientation within the gravity field allows the establishment of a lateral auxin gradient across the cap, which is transported through the lateral root cap and epidermal cells to the transition zone, where it promotes differential cellular elongation between the top and bottom flanks, leading to downward curvature. Rootward auxin transport in the peripheral tissues of the root is mediated by AUX1 and PIN2 auxin influx and efflux facilitators, respectively, as well as ABC transporters [15,16,17,18]. The PIN2 protein is localized in the plasma membrane mostly on the shootward side of the lateral cap and epidermal cells, dictating the shootward transport of auxin through cell files. Its recycling between the endosome and plasma membrane, and the regulation of its stability, are critical for its function in auxin transport and gravitropism [19]. Its abundance within the plasma membrane of transporting cells is enhanced by increased auxin levels and GOLVEN peptide signaling on the bottom flank, a process that reinforces the auxin gradient across the root tip as it moves toward the transition zone [19,20]. Furthermore, PIN2-mediated reflux of auxin from the peripheral tissues back into the vasculature stream toward the root tip also occurs at the transition zone, contributing significantly to the modulation of root gravitropism [21]. The formation of an auxin gradient across the root tip and its transport to the transition zone and main segment of the elongation zone can be followed using live reporters. One of these reporters, named DII-VENUS, encodes a protein that carries the cis-acting motifs needed for recognition by the SCFTIR1 ubiquitin–ligase complex in the presence of auxin, leading to its degradation by the proteasome [22]. Hence, the cellular fluorescence signal generated by the DII-VENUS reporter rapidly decreases as a consequence of auxin-induced reporter degradation by the proteasome [22,23]. A better understanding of the key molecular mechanisms that modulate gravity sensing and signal transduction in plants requires an accurate method to evaluate organ gravisensitivity, such that genotypes with altered gravisensitivity can be identified and further characterized. Early studies suggested that the curvature response of a plant organ to gravistimulation varies linearly as a function of the logarithm of the dose of gravistimulation, itself defined as the product of gravity intensity by time of stimulation (g.s) [24]. Quantifying tip angle for distinct doses of initial gravistimulation led to dose–response curves that fit logarithmic functions. Extension of the corresponding best-fit functions to the time axis under 1 g allowed the determination of the presentation time, defined as the threshold stimulation time needed to produce curvature (reviewed in [25]). This method has been used extensively to estimate the gravisensitivity of plant organs despite ignoring the fact that very short periods of gravistimulation well below the presentation time can still induce gravicurvature when applied repeatedly. The threshold time of intermittent gravistimulation leading to gravicurvature (the perception time) is shorter than 1 s, suggesting the gravisensing machinery is exquisitely sensitive to reorientation [26,27,28]. A re-evaluation of some of the data presented in previous presentation time studies revealed that a hyperbolic model better fits the observed data than the initially used logarithmic model [25]. Such hyperbolic models intersect the time axis at the origin, suggesting the slope of the best-fit hyperbolic model at the origin might provide a better representation of gravisensitivity than the presentation time [25]. Interestingly, a recent study using a centrifugation approach coupled with growth kinematics imaging provided support for a contribution of organ inclination, rather than gravity intensity, in shoot gravity sensing [29]. The presentation and perception times described above are much shorter than the time needed for initiation of the resulting curvature. This implies that the initial gravistimulation should be followed by a period without stimulation to allow the plant organ to develop curvature that is commensurate with the initial stimulus. The microgravity conditions encountered during spaceflight or at the International Space Station (ISS) are ideal for the implementation of such experiments [30,31,32]. Unfortunately, using either platform is very expensive and access to them is very limited. Furthermore, the use of centrifuges to create fractional gravity in space implies the creation of sharp gravity gradients between the center of the centrifuge and its periphery, which can have an unwanted impact on plant responses. To overcome these difficulties, researchers have used low-speed clinostats to mimic microgravity during the curving phase of the graviresponse. Indeed, these continuously rotating devices average the plant orientation relative to the gravity vector during each rotation cycle (reviewed in [33]). However, using this approach to define organ gravisensitivity is heavily reliant on the assumption that clinorotation does not have an impact of its own on root growth behavior. Unfortunately, published data may suggest otherwise. First, it is important to note that research teams have used clinostats to mimic microgravity in a variety of different ways, including rotating the plants at a range of angular velocities (from 0.33 to 60 RPM), with one rotation axis parallel or perpendicular to the longitudinal growth axis of the plants (horizontal vs. vertical clinorotation, respectively), or rotating in space (three-dimensional clinostats or random positioning machines) (reviewed in [34]). A recent and careful investigation of the impact of various forms of clinorotation on plant organs growth revealed that slow horizontal clinorotation at 1 RPM induces stress responses in root statocytes and lower endodermal cells, whereas fast clinorotation in the range of 60 RPM leads to the directional root growth response to a force that results from both gravity and the centrifugal acceleration [34]. These results suggest a need to re-evaluate the use of clinostats as microgravity mimics in experiments aimed at quantifying plant gravisensitivity. Considering that previous experiments aimed at evaluating the sensitivity of plant organs to gravistimulation used low-speed clinorotation to allow the development of a proportional curvature response to defined doses of gravistimulation applied before clinorotation, and given that presentation times of 0.4–5 min were previously reported for Arabidopsis thaliana organs using these methods [12,13,35,36], we set up an experiment to investigate whether low-speed clinorotation might itself trigger a directional root growth response without an initial dose of gravistimulation before clinorotation. Indeed, if seedlings are positioned vertically on a clinostat and rotation is initiated at a speed of 0.5 RPM, their organs will be exposed to a unidirectional gravistimulus over the first half-turn of clinorotation, which should last 60 s, before being exposed to a gravistimulus from the opposite direction. If the first half-turn of gravistimulation is sufficiently long enough to induce a persistent polarity in the statocytes, it should be sufficient to promote curvature at the end of clinorotation. In fact, our previous experiments aimed at evaluating the effect of clinorotation on Arabidopsis root skewing on hard agar surfaces uncovered the existence of clinostat-dependent root tip curvatures that were compatible with this “clinostat effect” [37]. To better understand the effects exerted by low-speed clinorotation on root growth behavior and their connections with gravitropism, we exposed Arabidopsis thaliana (a dicot model) and Brachypodium distachyon (a genetic model for monocot plants) seedlings, growing on agar-solidified medium, to low-speed clinorotation in the absence of a previous gravistimulus (defined as seedling reorientation away from the vertical), and analyzed their root tip responses to such clinorotation. We demonstrate the development of root tip curvature in both species at low speeds of clinorotation, and show that mutations affecting early steps of gravity sensing and/or signal transduction interfere with this clinostat effect. We also show that low-speed clinorotation leading to root tip curvature promotes the relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the side membrane of the root cap statocytes and the development of a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. We conclude that gravitropism contributes to the clinostat effect on root growth direction under low-speed clinorotation, and discuss the potential implications of these findings for our understanding of root gravisensitivity.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Plant Material and Growth Conditions Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col and Ws (originally received from ABRC, Columbus, OH, USA) and of Brachypodium distachyon Bd21-3 and Ron-2 accessions (received from the Amasino laboratory at the University of Wisconsin–Madison) were used as experimental materials in this study. Arabidopsis mutants with defects in gravity signal transduction were also used in this project, including arg1-2 (Ws background) and arg1-3 (SALK_024542, Col background) [6,7,8], pgm-1 (Col background) [8], toc132-3 (GABI_394E01, Col background) [50], toc 132-4 (SALKseq061933), and mar2-1 (Ws background) [6,8]. A transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana arg1-2 mutant expressing the 35Sp:ARG1 transgene (arg1-2[35S:ARG1]) was also used as a control [7]. Finally, transgenic lines expressing the DII::VENUS and pPIN3::PIN3-GFP reporters in the Col background were used in confocal microscopy [5,22]. Seedlings from the Col accession were chosen for most experiments because their roots display a minimal amount of root skewing on hard agar surfaces [37], a behavior that could potentially complicate interpretation of the results. Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface-sterilized, germinated, and grown on the surface of a half-strength LS medium with 0.8% agar under 16/8 h day/night cycles at 20–22 °C (cool-white LED light at ~70 µE·m−2·s−1), as described in [8]. Brachypodium distachyon seeds were dehusked and surface-sterilized with five successive 1 min washes in 95% (w/v) ethanol, and then air dried in a sterile hood for at least 20 min. Sterilized seeds were soaked with autoclaved Milli-Q water in darkness at 4 °C for 24 h. Seeds were then plated on the surface on 1% agar plates with 0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium (Sigma) and grown under red LED light at ~15 µE·m−2·s−1 (Tangkula Inc., Ontario, CA, USA) for 24 h to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to new agar plates and grown under white LED light at ~75 µE·m−2·s−1 (Tangela Inc., Ontario, CA, USA) for 5 h to stabilize the transplanted seedlings. Then, the plates were set into the clinostat chambers in the dark for an additional 4 h before clinorotation assay. 4.2. Clinorotation Assays After germination using the protocols described under the subsection Plant Materials and Growth Conditions, germinated seedlings were transferred to fresh 0.5× LS with 0.8% agar-based medium, aligned at the middle of the plate with the root tips directed downward. The new plates containing these transplanted seedlings were then mounted in the clinostat chamber with root tips oriented downward, and were maintained in this position for 4 h to stabilize the transplanted seedlings before clinorotation (unless stated otherwise). After stabilization, the seedlings were subjected to either vertical or parallel clinorotation. In all but one of the clinorotation systems described below (the two-chamber vertical clinorotation system being the exception), the clinostat used an ATmega328 microcomputer to control a 12 V 350 mA stepper motor connected to a belt and gears. These were connected to a shaft with centrally mounted lightproof acrylic boxes to hold square Petri plates. For vertical clinorotation, the clinostat chamber was positioned such that the plates it contained were perpendicular to the rotation axis (Supplemental Figure S2A,B). Half of the plates were oriented such that their lids were directed to the right of the clinostat, the other half with the lids directed to the left. This allowed us to test the effects of both clockwise and counterclockwise clinorotations on seedling root growth in the same experiment. In all experiments described in this manuscript, the direction of clinorotation (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) is defined based on observations from the back side (through the agar-based medium). In some vertical clinorotation experiments, half of the plates were transferred into the clinostat chamber with seedlings oriented vertically downward (roots directed upward) so that their roots would be exposed to gravistimulation from the other side during the first half-turn of clinorotation relative to those starting the experiment in the normal upright position. In this set of experiments, clinorotation was initiated immediately after transferring the plates into the clinostat chamber. A two-chamber-based vertical clinorotation system was also designed to evaluate the clinostat effect on root tip curvature. The two-chamber-based clinostat was built by modifying a Thomas Scientific HYBAID hybridization oven. In this system, two chambers were located on opposite sides of the horizontal axis of the clinostat. The first chamber was loaded with plates carrying seedlings in an upright position, whereas chamber 2 was loaded with plates in the opposite orientation (upside down seedlings at the start of clinorotation; see Supplemental Figure S2C,D). In both chambers, half of the plates were inserted with their lids directed toward the left of the clinostat (clockwise rotation), the other half with the lids directed toward the right (counterclockwise rotation). In parallel clinorotation, the plates were positioned parallel to the axis of rotation within the clinostat chamber, with their seedlings oriented parallel to the gravity vector before clinorotation (Supplemental Figure S2E,F). The plates were positioned back-to-back in the chamber, with half of them having their lids directed toward the front of the chamber, and the other half having lids directed toward the back of the chamber. Therefore, during the first half-turn of clinorotation, the side of the roots facing the front of the plate was directed toward gravity in the first group of plates, whereas the side of the roots facing the medium was directed toward gravity in the second group of plates (Supplemental Figure S2E,F). Horizontal clinorotation was carried out by positioning the clinostat chamber in such a way that both the plates and the seedlings within them were parallel to the axis of rotation (Supplemental Figure S2G,H). Here again, the plates were positioned back-to-back in the chamber, exposing seedling roots to gravity on the side exposed to air in the first group of plates, and on the side facing the medium in the second group, during the first half-turn of clinorotation. After clinostat loading and a resting period (when applicable), the seedlings were clinorotated in darkness for 12 or 18 h (for Brachypodium and Arabidopsis seedlings, respectively) at the speeds defined in the text. At the end of clinorotation, the plates were scanned with an Epson Perfection V33 scanner, and root tip angles were measured using ImageJ. Rose plots were generated by Microsoft Excel. To generate publication-quality pictures, we used Photoshop to increase the brightness and contrast of representative images, avoiding any shape distortion. 4.3. Microscopy Transgenic Col seedlings expressing the DII::VENUS and PIN3p::PIN3-GFP reporter constructs were grown for 5 days on the surface of 0.5 × LS, 0.8% agar (type E, Sigma) medium with a coverslip embedded in the center of the plates. Plates were then mounted into a clinostat and stabilized for more than 4 h in the dark to avoid mechanical stimuli. After different periods of clinorotation (defined in the text), a coverslip was placed on top of the seedlings, and the mount was transferred to the confocal microscope stage for imaging. This sandwiching approach allowed us to unambiguously relate reporter signal asymmetry to clinorotation polarity for each sample. Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope using excitation and emission wavelengths of 514 and 570 nm to detect VENUS, or 488 and 546 nm to detect PIN3-GFP. The detector gain range was set up for 730 to 850 nm and the scan mode was “by frame”. Seedlings were rotated clockwise but imaged from either side of the coverslip depending on sample setup. Signal intensity was measured using ImageJ (Plot Profile). A heatmap was generated by inputting the grey image of the signal channel and using the Look-Up Tables (LUTs) plug-in from ImageJ to reflect the difference in intensity by color [51].",

Low-Speed Clinorotation Triggers Directional Root Tip Curvature in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon Seedlings To investigate the effect of clinorotation on root growth behavior without prior gravistimulation, we subjected vertically grown Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedlings to low-speed clinorotation in darkness, and then measured root tip reorientation at the end of the treatment. For Arabidopsis thaliana, we used seedlings from the Col and Ws ecotypes because several mutants with defects in the early steps of gravity sensing and signal transduction are available in these backgrounds (see below). In the first assay, Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings growing on the surface of an agar-based medium in Petri dishes were subjected to low-speed (0.2 RPM) vertical clinorotation in clockwise or counterclockwise directions. The results summarized in Figure 1A,B (upper halves of the panels) indicate that the roots of Col seedlings exposed to clockwise clinorotation curved to the right, eventually reaching tip angles of around 25.5 ± 4.9 degrees, whereas those exposed to counterclockwise clinorotation curved to the left, reaching tip angles of −38.5 ± 7.1 degrees. A similar effect was also observed when Ws seedlings were tested in this assay (Figure 2A,B). The roots of seedlings that were maintained in the clinostat chamber without being clinorotated (vertical controls, labeled ST in Figure 2) did not develop tip curvature, suggesting that clinorotation is responsible for root reorientation. Clinorotation did not significantly affect the growth of wild type Col and Ws roots (Supplemental Figure S1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Representative root tips of Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedlings curve in response to low-speed vertical clinorotation: (A) 5-day-old Arabidopsis (Col, upper panel) and 3-day-old Brachypodium (Bd21-3, lower panel) seedlings were clinorotated clockwise (C) or counterclockwise (CC) at 0.2 RPM or stationary growth (ST) in darkness for 24 h.

(B) Quantification of root tip angles at the end of clinorotation (n = 12 to 17). The distributions of root tip angles for each experiment are represented as violin plots. The box plots within each violin indicate median (horizontal bar) and mean values (X), along with the quartiles (rectangular boxes) and standard deviations (whiskers) of the distributions. *** Refers to the t-test p-value of < 0.001. These experiments were repeated twice, with similar results.Figure 2. Open in a new tab Gravitropism-deficient Arabidopsis mutants do not show root tip curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation: 5-day-old wild type, mutant, and transgenically rescued Arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to either 0.2 RPM vertical clinorotation or stationary growth (ST) in darkness for 18 h. Rose plots of root tip angles measured at the end of each experiment are represented for each genotype (represented at the top) and each experimental condition (represented on the left). These rose plots are split into 18 bins of 20 degrees each. The proportion of the measured population of root tip angles falling into a specific bin is represented by a wedge within that bin. The bin representing seedlings with root tips directed toward the bottom within 0 to 20 degrees of the vertical is directed to the bottom, the bin representing 80–100 degrees is directed to the right, the one representing 160–180 degrees to the top, and the one representing 260–280 degrees to the left. Photographs of representative seedlings taken at the end of each experiment are shown above each rose plot. Several alleles of (A) arg1 and (B) toc132 were tested in this experiment, along with their respective wild types, and an arg1-2 mutant line transformed with a 35Sp::ARG1 transgene (arg1-2[35S:ARG1]). nN = 12–25.To determine whether this effect is Arabidopsis-specific, we subjected Brachypodium distachyon seedlings (Bd21-3 accession) to a similar experimental protocol. Results shown in Figure 1A,B (lower halves of the panels) indicate that the seedling roots of this monocot model also responded to clockwise clinorotation by curving rightward (tip angles of 12.5 ± 2.9 degrees), whereas those exposed to counterclockwise clinorotation curved to the left (eventually reaching tip angles of −14.8 ± 1.4). The roots of stationary seedlings did not develop tip curvature (Figure 1A,B). Clinorotation did not significantly affect Brachypodium root growth relative to the stationary growth control (t-test p-value = 0.41 and 0.22). This result demonstrates that low-speed clinorotation also promotes root tip curvature in Brachypodium distachyon. A second experimental setup was designed to confirm the existence of a clinostat effect on root growth direction, relying on the two-chamber system described in the Materials and Methods section and illustrated in Supplemental Figure S2C,D. In this system, the plates loaded in chamber 1 were oriented such that seedlings were in an upright position, whereas those loaded in chamber 2 were upside down. During the first half-turn of clinorotation, the right and left sides of seedlings located in chamber 1 and chamber 2, respectively, were directed toward the gravity vector (Supplemental Figure S2C,D). When clinorotated clockwise at 0.2 RPM, chamber 1 seedlings curved to the right, whereas those exposed to counterclockwise clinorotation curved leftward (tip angles of 22.6 ± 5.1 and −25.9 ± 9.4 degrees, respectively; Supplemental Figure S3A). The opposite results were observed in chamber 2, where seedlings exposed to clockwise rotation curved leftward and those exposed to counterclockwise rotation curved rightward (tip angles of −19.2 ± 11.3 and 14.2 ± 8.6 degrees, respectively; Supplemental Figure S3A). To further confirm these observations, we subjected Bd21-3 Brachypodium distachyon seedlings to 0.2 RPM parallel clinorotation, where plates were oriented parallel to the clinostat axis, with seedlings oriented vertically at the beginning of the experiment (Supplemental Figures S2E,F and S3B). Plates were loaded back-to-back into the chamber, and clinorotation was immediately initiated. Half of the plates had seedlings with their air-exposed side facing the gravity vector during the first half-turn of clinorotation, whereas the other half had seedlings with their medium-facing side directed toward gravity. At the end of clinorotation, the root tips of a majority of tested seedlings in the first group (five out of seven) had curved away from the surface (Supplemental Figure S3B, left), whereas those from the second group (with medium-facing side directed toward gravity during the first half-turn of rotation) tended to either penetrate the agar-based medium (five out of seven seedlings tested) or skew on its surface. We also subjected Bd21-3 seedlings to 0.2 RPM horizontal clinorotation, where the plates were positioned vertically in the clinostat chamber with seedlings oriented horizontally, parallel to the clinostat axis (Supplemental Figures S2G,H and S3C). Here again, plates were loaded back-to-back into the chamber, and clinorotation was immediately initiated. At the end of clinorotation, the root tips of a vast majority of the tested seedlings (15 out of 16) whose air-exposed side faced the gravity vector during the first half-turn of clinorotation had curved away from the surface (Supplemental Figure S3C, left), whereas those with medium-exposed surfaces directed toward gravity during the first half-turn tended to penetrate the agar-based medium (8 out of 8 seedlings tested) (Supplemental Figure S3C, right). Taken together, the results from these experiments demonstrate that low-speed clinorotation triggers directional root tip curvature dependent upon both the orientation of the seedlings at the beginning of clinorotation and the polarity of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise, Figure 1; Supplemental Figure S3). In all these experiments, the roots curved in a direction defined by the side that faced gravity during the first half-turn of clinorotation, starting from a vertical root, suggesting a role for gravitropism in this response. 2.2. Mutations Affecting Early Steps of Gravity Signal Transduction Interfere with the Clinostat Effect To test the contribution of gravitropism to the clinostat effect, we evaluated root curvature responses to clockwise vertical clinorotation of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with defects in early phases of gravity sensing and/or signal transduction, including two arg1 mutant lines (arg1-2 and arg1-3; [7]) and the corresponding transgenic rescue line (arg1-2[35S:ARG1]), three toc132 mutant lines (toc132-3, toc132-4, and mar2-1; [8]), and the starch-deficient pgm-1 mutant [13]. While the roots of control wild type seedlings (Col and Ws) displayed strong curvature responses to clinorotation at speeds of 0.2 RPM relative to stable non-clinorotated controls (ST), those of pgm, arg1, and toc132 mutant seedlings did not display much of a clinostat effect (Figure 2; Supplemental Figure S4A,B; Table 1). Their average root tip curvature upon clinorotation was significantly different from that of the wild type (t-test p-value < 0.05; Table 1). The root tips of pgm and arg1 mutant seedlings also displayed a more random orientation than the wild type under control growth conditions (no clinorotation; ST), indicative of gravitropism defects, whereas those of toc132/mar2 seedlings did not, in agreement with a previous report [8] (F-test p-value < 0.05; Table 1; Figure 2; Supplemental Figure S4). The roots of transgenic homozygous arg1-2 mutant seedlings expressing the 35Sp:ARG1 transgene displayed a significant clinostat effect (Table 1), demonstrating phenotype rescue by the transgene (Figure 2). Clinorotation did not alter root growth in either wild type or mutant seedlings relative to stationary controls (Supplemental Figure S1A–C). Taken together, these results support a contribution of gravitropism to the clinostat effect. Table 1.

The Speed of Clinorotation Impacts the Clinostat Effect If gravitropism is responsible for the clinostat effect, the initial period of exposure to directional gravistimulation, hence the speed of clinorotation, should impact the level of root tip curvature at the end of the experiment, with shorter periods of initial exposure (associated with higher speeds of clinorotation) resulting in lower curvatures. To test the validity of this assumption, we subjected wild type Col seedlings to clinorotation at speeds of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 RPM, and evaluated the resulting root tip curvatures at the end of clinorotation. In Figure 3, panels A and B show that lower clinorotation speeds lead to increased root tip curvature angles (more significant clinostat effects). Figure 3. Open in a new tab The speed of clinorotation affects the level of root tip curvature: (A) Representative root tip images of Arabidopsis seedlings clinorotated clockwise at the indicated speeds (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 RPM) and stationary growth (ST) in darkness for 18 h. gc represents the gravity vector at the onset of clinorotation. (B) Rose plot of the root tip angles (in degrees) at the end of clinorotation at the indicated speeds. (C,D) Root tip angles in degrees (C) and total root tip curvatures (D) reached at the end of 18 h clinorotation as functions of the duration of the first half-turn of clinorotation (half periodicity, in s). Best-fit logarithmic models (dotted lines) are represented on these graphs, whose functions are indicated at the top along with the corresponding correlation values (R2). The realization time (TR) deduced from these functions is indicated at the bottom right of each graph. n= 20. This experiment was repeated twice, with similar results.To better understand the relationship between rotation speed and resulting root tip curvature, we plotted the average values of root tip angle (Figure 3C) and total tip curvature (Figure 3D) (Y axis) over the duration of the first half-turn of clinorotation (X axis), and then modeled the results with a best-fit logarithmic function (a method analogous to that used to estimate the presentation time [25]). The best-fit models identified in these experiments closely matched the observed data, with R2 values often exceeding 0.9 (Figure 3). Their intersection with the X axis defines the minimal period of half-turn clinorotation needed to determine the polarity of root tip curvature. We named this parameter the realization time (TR). In the experiments shown in Figure 3C, the roots of wild type Col seedlings displayed a TR of 35 s. Two additional independent trials led to similar TR estimates for Arabidopsis wild type Col roots (Supplemental Figure S5). On the other hand, similar experiments carried out with two distinct mar2 (toc132) mutants showed longer realization times of 54.7 s and 62.6 s, respectively (Supplemental Figure S6A). No TR values could be assigned to the pgm1 and arg1 mutants because both developed only minor, insignificant curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation that did not fit with a logarithmic model (Supplemental Figure S6B). One limitation of the experiment described in Figure 3 is that it attempts to correlate the stimulus provided during the first half-turn of clinorotation with the final angle of curvature even though the same stimulus is provided incrementally at each cycle of clinorotation throughout the whole experiment. To investigate the possible contribution of additional rounds of clinorotation (beyond the first half-turn) to curvature specification, we modified the clinorotation experiment to first include one or more curvature-inducing cycles at the beginning of the experiment (a phase we call “inductive”), and followed it with a phase of non-inductive 3 RPM clinorotation to allow curvature development (schematized in Figure 4A, left panel). The inductive phase included one, two, three, four, or five cycles of clinorotation at a speed of 0.2 RPM. Two controls included one experiment without an inductive phase (all cycles at 3 RPM), and a second experiment with all cycles being inductive at 0.2 RPM. The results shown in Figure 4 indicate that continuous clinorotation at 3 RPM is not sufficient to induce a significant root tip curvature relative to non-clinorotated controls (ST), as expected. Similarly, neither one, two, or three cycles of inductive clinorotation were insufficient to promote the clinostat effect. However, an inductive phase of four or five cycles at 0.2 RPM followed by 18 h at 3 RPM led to root tip curvatures similar to those generated by continuous clinorotation at 0.2 RPM (Figure 4). Hence, only four inductive clinorotation cycles at 0.2 RPM are sufficient to trigger strong root tip curvature similar to that triggered by continuous rotation at this speed (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Several rounds of inductive clinorotation are needed for maximal root tip curvature response: 5-day-old wild type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Col accession) were subjected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 rounds of inductive 0.2 RPM clinorotation in darkness before being exposed to 18 h non-inductive clinorotation at 3 RPM. Root tip angles were measured at the end of each experiment and plotted over the number of inductive clinorotation rounds. The results are represented in the form of a violin chart. The box plots within each violin indicate median (horizontal bar) and mean values (X), along with the quartiles (rectangular boxes) and standard deviations (whiskers) of the distributions. One-way ANOVA analysis was performed. Different letters identify significantly different responses (Tukey’s HSD test, p < 0.05). This experiment was repeated twice, with similar results. 2.4. Low-Speed Clinorotation Triggers the Formation of an Asymmetric Auxin Gradient across the Root Tip If the clinostat effect is a consequence of gravitropism, low-speed clinorotation should trigger an asymmetric auxin redistribution across the root tip, preceding the initiation of root tip curvature. To investigate this possibility, we clinorotated, at 0.2 RPM, wild type Arabidopsis thaliana Col seedlings transformed with the DII-VENUS auxin reporter [22]. Analysis of VENUS expression along the root tip of control non-rotated seedlings (ST) revealed symmetrical signals in epidermal and lateral cap cells on opposite flanks of the root tip up to the transition zone (Figure 5A). The symmetrical signal was also found across the root tips of seedlings exposed to non-inductive 3 RPM clinorotation for 1, 2, or 6 h (Figure 5A). As expected, strong signal asymmetry was observed across the root tips of 1 h gravistimulated seedlings, with a dramatic signal decrease on the lower side of the root ([22]; Figure 5A; Supplemental Figure S7A,B). Interestingly, an asymmetrical VENUS signal was also apparent across the root tip after 1 h of low-speed clinorotation (0.2 RPM), with a lower signal on the root tip side that was directed toward gravity during the first half-turn of clinorotation (Figure 5A; Supplemental Figure S7A,B). Signal asymmetry persisted after 2 and 6 h of clinorotation, although the asymmetry was weaker at these later time points than after 1 h (Figure 5A, Supplemental Figure S7A,B). Signal quantification confirmed significant signal asymmetry upon both GS and low-speed (0.2 RPM) clinorotation (Figure 5A, Supplemental Figure S7A,B). These results are compatible with the development of an auxin gradient across the root tip of low-speed-clinorotated Arabidopsis seedlings, with auxin accumulation on the side of the root facing gravity during the first half-turn of clinorotation. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Low-speed vertical clinorotation leads to asymmetric auxin distribution across the root tip: 5-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Col) expressing the DII::VENUS auxin reporter were subjected to 0.2 RPM (left) or 3 RPM (right) vertical clinorotation in darkness for the time periods indicated above each picture. Non-clinorotated (ST) and constantly gravistimulated (GS) controls were included in this experiment. Panel (A) shows representative confocal images of root tip DII::VENUS fluorescence signals under the rotation conditions and times defined at the top; the middle images show the confocal DII-VENUS fluorescence signals merged with bright field views of the same roots; the bottom images show the results of signal quantification in the form of signal intensity heatmaps generated using the LUT plug-in from the ImageJ. Scale bars represent 50 µm. Panel (B) demonstrates how low-speed clinorotation leads to mild PIN3 relocalization in the columella cells of the root cap. 5-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Col accession) expressing a PIN3-GFP construct were either clinorotated at 0.2 and 3 RPM in darkness, gravistimulated, or grown straight downward without clinorotation or gravistimulation (ST) for 0, 1, 2, or 6 h. The PIN3-GFP fluorescent signal was then analyzed by confocal microscopy. A mild polarization of the signal appeared in the columella cells of the root cap (yellow arrows) within 1 h of 0.2 RPM clinorotation and continued over a period of 6 h. Similar polarization was not seen upon 3 RPM clinorotation or when the seedlings were neither gravistimulated nor clinorotated. Quantification of VENUS signals from panel (A) were presented in Supplemental Figure S7A. In panels (A) and (B), the direction of gravity (g) at the onset of clinorotation (or gravistimulation, GS) is represented by a black arrow.If gravitropism is truly responsible for the clinostat effect, the auxin gradient developed across clinorotated roots should originate from the root cap columella cells, where a redistribution of plasma-membrane-associated PIN3 and PIN7 proteins should occur (reviewed in [1]). To test this assumption, we subjected Col seedlings expressing the PIN3-GFP transgene [38] to the same low-speed clinorotation assay and analyzed GFP fluorescence signal in the root cap at 0, 1, 2, and 6 h following the onset of clinorotation. The results shown in Figure 5B show a mild increase in PIN3-GFP signal intensity in the lateral membrane of tier 2 and 3 columella cells at the side of the roots that faced down during the first half-turn of clinorotation; this occurred within 1 h of clinorotation. The asymmetry of this PIN3-GFP signal was milder than the one observed in response to normal gravistimulation. It was still present after 2 and 6 h of clinorotation, but it was less pronounced after 6 h. No signal asymmetry was found when the roots were not stimulated (ST), or when the roots were clinorotated at the higher speed of 3 RPM, which is non-inductive (Figure 5B). To evaluate the relative timing of PIN3-GFP relocalization in the root cap statocytes and DII-VENUS gradient formation across the root tip relative to curvature initiation upon clinorotation, we quantified the root tip angle of the same clinorotated PIN3-GFP-expressing seedlings at different times following 0.2 RPM clinorotation onset. The results shown in Supplemental Figure S8 indicate the appearance of a significant curvature after 5 h of clinorotation. Although the kinetics of fluorescent marker changes have to be taken with caution considering the time needed for marker maturation during synthesis and/or marker degradation [22], we note that the appearance of asymmetrical PIN3-GFP and DII-VENUS signals in the root tips precede the initiation of the corresponding curvature (Figure 5A,B; Supplemental Figure S7). These results are compatible with the few initial rounds of clinorotation leading to PIN relocalization toward one side of the columella cells dictated by the gravistimulus imposed during the first half-turn of clinorotation, lateral auxin transport, and the resulting curvature response. 2.5. The Bd21-3 and Ron-2 Brachypodium distachyon Accessions Are Differentially Responsive to Low-Speed Clinorotation Considering our observations of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with distinct abilities to develop root tip curvatures in response to low-speed clinorotation (Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure S4), we wondered whether the genetic variation existing between natural populations of Brachypodium distachyon might also be associated with distinct abilities to respond to clinorotation. To address this possibility, we subjected seedlings of the Bd21-3 and Ron-2 accessions to different speeds of vertical clinorotation (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 RPM), and then evaluated the resulting root tip curvatures. The results shown in Figure 6A demonstrate strong and weak responses to 0.1 and 0.2 RPM clinorotations, respectively, leading to a realization time (TR) of 91 s for Bd21-3. Ron-2, on the other hand, displayed no root tip curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation, preventing us from assessing the realization time for this accession. These results demonstrate the existence of a large variability between Brachypodium accessions for their abilities to develop root tip curvatures under low-speed clinorotation. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Brachypodium distachyon accessions display distinct root tip curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation: 3-day-old Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21-3 and Ron-2 accessions were subjected to clinorotation at speeds of 0 (ST control), 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 RPM for 14 h in darkness. The seedlings were photographed at the end of each experiment. Panel (A) shows representative root tip images of Bd21-3 and Ron-2 seedlings exposed to the clinorotation conditions summarized at the top. (B) Averaged root tip angles at the end of clinorotation along with their standard deviations are plotted over the time needed to complete half a turn of clinorotation in the corresponding experiment. A logarithmic model was fit to the data (dotted line) and used to calculate the realization time (TR) for responding seedlings. The function associated with the best-fit model is represented at the top of the graph along with the corresponding R2 value. Ron-2 seedlings did not respond to clinorotation, thus it was not possible to assign a specific TR value to them. n = 6–11. This experiment was repeated twice, with similar results.",
    "discussion": "3. Discussion Since their inception by von Sachs in 1879 [39], clinostats have been advertised as useful systems to mimic microgravity on Earth. By constantly rotating around one or two axes, these devices simulate weightlessness by averaging a plant’s orientation relative to gravity at each rotation cycle. Consequently, the plant is never exposed to gravity from one side for long enough to trigger a tropic response. Under these conditions, the plant organs are expected to display growth behaviors that are comparable to those seen under microgravity as long as the speed of rotation remains sufficiently low to keep the centrifugal force below the limit of detection by the organism (reviewed in [34]). In plants, clinostats have been used rather effectively to evaluate the effect of microgravity on processes as diverse as tropic responses, plant morphology, metabolism, organ growth, cell division, organelle morphology, and nutrient uptake, to cite just a few examples [25,40,41,42]. They have also been extensively used to investigate plant organs’ sensitivity to gravistimulation (reviewed in [25]). Considering that repeated short periods of gravistimulation can trigger a gravitropic response [25,26,27], we wanted to reassess the assumption that low-speed clinorotation truly simulates weightlessness. Indeed, if a vertical plant is suddenly exposed to low-speed vertical clinorotation, its organs will be gravistimulated from the same side over a period corresponding to the first half-turn of rotation. If this initial half-turn of clinorotation is sufficiently long enough to trigger a response polarity, it should ultimately lead to organ curvature. This clinorotation effect should be observed with other clinorotation configurations as well, for similar reasons. In this manuscript, we use Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedling roots to test this hypothesis. We show that low-speed clinorotation under a variety of configurations triggers root tip curvature in which direction and degree are dictated by the polarity and period of rotation, respectively. Under vertical clinorotation, seedling roots responded to clockwise or counterclockwise clinorotation at speeds below 0.5 RPM by curving to the right and left, respectively, as long as the seedlings started clinorotation at a vertical orientation (Figure 1). In the two-chamber vertical clinostat system described in Supplemental Figure S2C,D, the seedlings are initially positioned upright in one of the chambers, and upside down in the second chamber. When clinorotated clockwise, the seedling roots in the first chamber curve to the right, whereas those in the second chamber curve to the left (Supplemental Figure S3A). Interestingly, during the first half-turn of clockwise clinorotation, the right flank of the seedlings is directed toward gravity in chamber 1 and away from it in chamber 2, again potentially explaining the opposite polarities of root tip curvature displayed by these seedlings at the end of the experiment. This conclusion seems reinforced by our observation of opposite responses when counterclockwise clinorotation is applied (Supplemental Figure S3A). It should be noted here that the angles of curvature reached by the roots of chamber 2 seedlings exposed to 0.2 RPM clinorotation are smaller than those displayed by chamber 1 seedlings (Supplemental Figure S3A). The reason for this difference is not clear, although it is possible that the mechanostimulus associated with quickly turning the plates 90 degrees to position them within chamber 2 before clinorotation might somewhat alter their ability to respond to gravistimulation [43]. When plates are positioned parallel to the clinostat axis, with Brachypodium seedlings oriented upright at the beginning of clinorotation (parallel clinorotation, Supplemental Figure S2E,F), forward clinorotation at 0.2 RPM results in directing the air-facing side of the seedlings to the gravity vector during the first half-turn, ultimately leading to the roots lifting off the agar surface. When clinorotated in the opposite direction, the roots tend to either penetrate the agar surface, or meander on it if they cannot penetrate (Supplemental Figure S3B). Similar results are obtained when Brachypodium seedlings are positioned horizontally on the clinostat (Supplemental Figure S3C). In all these low-speed clinorotation experiments, the roots curve toward the side that faces the gravity vector during the first half-turn of clinorotation, as long as they start in a vertical orientation and the speed of rotation is sufficiently low. Indeed, 3 RPM clinorotations do not trigger root tip curvature under these experimental conditions (Figure 4). Therefore, our results are compatible with a role for gravitropism in modulating the low-speed clinostat effect on root growth direction. If gravitropism is an integral component of the clinostat effect on root growth direction, mutations that affect gravitropism should alter the clinostat effect on root growth direction. Furthermore, the clinostat effect should be associated with the formation of a lateral auxin gradient across the root tip, a process accompanied by relocalization of the PIN3 and PIN7 auxin efflux facilitators to the lateral membrane of columella statocytes early during clinorotation (reviewed in [1]). Our results are consistent with both assumptions. Indeed, mutations that affect early phases of gravity sensing and signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana strongly affect root tip responses to low-speed clinorotation (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S4). This includes a mutation in the PGM gene, which encodes phosphoglucomutase, an enzyme that contributes to starch biosynthesis. Mutations in this gene have been reported to affect starch content in the amyloplasts of plant statocytes, thereby affecting their ability to sediment in response to gravistimulation [13]. The defect in mutant amyloplast sedimentation correlated with altered gravitropic response in roots, hypocotyls, and stems of Arabidopsis, in agreement with a role for amyloplast sedimentation in gravity sensing [44]. Importantly, previous studies of amyloplast sedimentation in the root cap statocytes of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under the same growth conditions as our study have demonstrated significant sedimentation after only 1 or 2 min of reorientation [8], which is compatible with the time needed for the clinostat to complete its first half-turn under the inductive conditions used in this project. Taken together, these results are compatible with a role for amyloplast sedimentation, during the first half-turn of clinorotation (due to plant reorientation within the gravity field), in clinostat-induced root tip curvature. Mutations in ARG1 are also shown to alter root tip responses to low-speed clinorotation in this project, a phenotype that is suppressed by expressing a wild type transgene in mutant plants (Figure 2). ARG1 and its paralog ARL2 encode J-domain membrane-associated proteins that are essential for PIN relocalization to the bottom membrane of root cap statocytes and their cytoplasmic alkalinization in response to gravistimulation [7], thereby modulating very early steps of gravity signal transduction in the statocytes. The impact of arg1 mutations on root tip curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation is again consistent with a role for gravitropism in this process. Mutations in the TOC132/MAR2 gene were previously shown to strongly affect root gravitropism in an arg1-2 mutant background while having little to no effect in a wild type ARG1 background. This strong genetic interaction between TOC132/MAR2 and ARG1 indicates a role in gravity signal transduction within the statocytes that does not impact starch accumulation or amyloplast sedimentation [8]. TOC132/MAR2 encodes a component of the translocon of the outer membrane of chloroplasts complex located on the surface of plastids, which contributes to protein import from the cytoplasm into the plastids and impacts gravity signal transduction [8,45]. In the experiments described in this manuscript, mutations in this gene strongly affected root tip curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation despite being present in a wild type ARG1 background. This result suggests that the root curvature response to clinorotation may constitute a more sensitive assay for gravitropism than a simple reorientation assay. Considering that root gravitropism typically involves the creation of a lateral auxin gradient across the root cap, followed by its propagation toward the elongation zone where it promotes differential cellular elongation and tip curvature, we used a transgenic DII-VENUS auxin reporter to document the formation of a lateral auxin gradient across clinorotated seedlings, showing signal disappearance on the flank of the root that was directed toward gravity during the first half-turn of rotation. This clinostat-induced signal gradient occurred within 1 h of clinorotation and decreased after 2 and 6 h. It occurred under low-speed clinorotation (0.2 RPM), but was not observed under non-inductive conditions at 3 RPM or in seedlings that were not clinorotated. Its intensity was lower than the sharp gradient observed in response to direct gravistimulation (Figure 5; Supplemental Figure S7). Interestingly, the PIN3 protein was also shown to relocalize to the side of the columella cells after 1 h of 0.2 RPM clinorotation. This relocalization resulted in PIN3 accumulation on the side membrane of the statocytes that was directed toward gravity during the first half-turn of clinorotation. It was less pronounced than observed in response to direct gravistimulation, and it was not observed under 3 RPM rotation (Figure 5; Supplemental Figure S7). Taken together, these results are compatible with the first half-turn of clinorotation at 0.2 RPM providing sufficient directional information to polarize the root cap statocytes, leading to PIN protein relocalization in the statocytes, auxin gradient formation along the root tip, and curvature response. The levels of PIN3 relocalization and steepness of the lateral auxin gradient triggered by 0.2 RPM clinorotation were not as strong as those established upon direct gravistimulation because the latter provides a continuous stimulus over time, with progressively decreasing inclination, whereas the stimulus provided during clinorotation occurs only for a limited time (half the period of clinorotation) before being interrupted by opposite inclination. The observation of increased curvature angles generated by clinorotation of increased periodicity is compatible with this explanation (Figure 3). We have been able to also show a logarithmic relationship between angle of curvature and period of clinorotation. When extended to the time axis, this function allows the estimation of a parameter we called realization time (TR), which we defined as the minimal period of half-turn clinorotation needed to set up a polarity of tip curvature response to clinorotation. While this approach was inspired from the presentation time analysis carried out to evaluate gravisensitivity of plant organs, it is important to recognize that the realization time parameter differs from the presentation time because in TR analysis, the same stimulus is provided at each following inductive cycle during clinorotation, whereas a single limited gravistimulus is provided prior to horizontal clinorotation in presentation time analysis. In this sense, the realization time is more reminiscent of the perception time parameter, defining sensitivities based on repeated short periods of gravistimulation. This conclusion is supported by the observation of a need for a minimum of four cycles of inductive clinorotation to allow the development of a significant curvature response at the end of the experiment (Figure 4). Future experiments will be aimed at elucidating the relationship existing between curvature response and total stimulation to evaluate possible reciprocity between number of inductive cycles and periodicity of each cycle as components of stimulation. Experiments have also been initiated to elucidate the potential impact of different speeds of clinorotation during the response (non-inductive) phase on the final curvature. Finally, it should be noted that our experiments were carried out with rather long periods of clinorotation, allowing for better reproducibility of the results (12 to 18 h). However, this implies that significant auto-straightening is likely to have occurred during such long periods of clinorotation, considering that the first signs of curvature were visible after 5 h (Supplemental Figure S7). Current research is aimed at documenting the impact of proprioception on the curvature responses to clinorotation using biometric data calculated from time-lapse images recorded using an infrared-sensitive camera mounted on the clinostat (Su et al., unpublished work). Previous reports documenting plant responses to clinorotation at different speeds demonstrated effects on organ curvatures only at higher speeds, where the organ tip appeared to reorient following the force vector resulting from both gravity and centrifugal acceleration. Clinorotation at the low speed of 1 RPM (or even 0.3 RPM in one case), did not trigger organ curvature responses [24,34,46,47,48,49]. It should be pointed out that the experiments we describe here also did not trigger any responses at 1 RPM. However, clear curvature responses were observed to clinorotations at 0.5 and 0.2 RPM. We also note that different accessions of Brachypodium distachyon displayed dramatically distinct responses to 0.2 and 0.5 RPM clinorotations, with Bd21-3 showing strong responses at 0.2 RPM and a weaker response at 0.5 RPM, whereas Ron-2 displayed no responses at all (Figure 6). Similarly, mutations affecting early steps of gravity sensing and signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana affected root curvature responses to inductive clinorotation (Figure 2). On the other hand, wild type Arabidopsis seedlings of the Col and Ws ecotypes were previously shown to display significant curvature responses to clinorotation at 1 RPM under distinct experimental conditions [37], whereas they showed no curvatures at 1 RPM in the experiments described here. We conclude that the genetic background of the plants being analyzed and the environmental and/or experimental conditions used to carry out these experiments will affect root tip curvature responses to clinorotation, emphasizing the need to carefully report both. In conclusion, our observations suggest a new method to evaluate root gravitropism, and possibly gravisensitivity, using clinorotation.

Copyright notice ID: 9861679 PMID: 36675054 Abstract Clinostats are instruments that continuously rotate biological specimens along an axis, thereby averaging their orientation relative to gravity over time. Our previous experiments indicated that low-speed clinorotation may itself trigger directional root tip curvature. In this project, we have investigated the root curvature response to low-speed clinorotation using Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedlings as models. We show that low-speed clinorotation triggers root tip curvature in which direction is dictated by gravitropism during the first half-turn of clinorotation. We also show that the angle of root tip curvature is modulated by the speed of clinorotation. Arabidopsis mutations affecting gravity susception (pgm) or gravity signal transduction (arg1, toc132) are shown to affect the root tip curvature response to low-speed clinorotation. Furthermore, low-speed vertical clinorotation triggers relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the lateral membrane of Arabidopsis root cap statocytes, and creates a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. Together, these observations support a role for gravitropism in modulating root curvature responses to clinorotation. Interestingly, distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display different abilities to develop root tip curvature responses to low-speed vertical clinorotation, suggesting the possibility of using genome-wide association studies to further investigate this process. Keywords: clinostat, gravitropism, gravisensitivity, Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon, presentation time, perception time, realization time, clinostat effect1. Introduction Most plants use gravitropism to guide the growth of their organs, directing primary roots vertically downward into the soil, primary shoots upward above ground, and secondary organs laterally, at an angle from the vertical named the gravity set point angle (GSA), to effectively explore their immediate surroundings. Overall, this process contributes to a plant’s ability to anchor itself into the soil, actively seek water and nutrients within its growth substrate, exchange gases, photosynthesize, and reproduce. Consequently, gravitropism is a key environmental response that allows plants to thrive under diverse environmental conditions, thereby contributing to plant fitness and productivity in their natural ecological niches as well as in agricultural settings. Gravitropism is composed of several successive phases that include gravity susception, believed to involve the sedimentation of heavy starch-filled plastids (amyloplasts, also named statoliths) in specialized cells (the statocytes) located in the starch sheath of shoots and in the columella cells of the root cap. This is followed by transduction into a biochemical signal through a process that remains largely unexplained, the formation of an auxin gradient across the gravistimulated organ, transmission of the gradient to the site of response, and differential cell elongation on opposite flanks of the organ, leading to a curvature response, usually upward for shoots and downward for roots (reviewed in [1]). The molecular mechanisms underlying the initial phases of gravity sensing and signal transduction in the statocytes remain largely unknown. However, this process leads to a fast cytoplasmic alkalinization of the statocytes upon gravistimulation, accompanied by a change in polarity of the cell associated with the transcytotic relocalization of the auxin efflux facilitators PIN3 and PIN7 to the new bottom membrane [2,3,4,5]. This relocalization is dependent upon the proper functioning of key regulators in the statocytes, including ALTERED RESPONSE TO GRAVITY 1 (ARG1) and its paralog ARG1-like 2 (ARL2) [6,7], MODIFIER OF arg1 1 (MAR1/TOC75) and MAR2/TOC132 [8], LAZY, RCC1-LIKE DOMAIN (RLD) [9,10,11], and ADENOSINE KINASE 1 (ADK1) [12]. Additionally, mutations in genes that encode enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis, such as pgm-1, affect gravitropism mostly by decreasing the density of statocyte amyloplasts, thereby affecting gravity susception [13]. Finally, PIN protein phosphorylation at conserved Ser residues has been shown to also modulate PIN3 relocalization in the statocytes and its auxin transport activity (reviewed in [14]). In roots, PIN3 and PIN7 relocalization in the upper layers of columella cells in the root cap upon plant reorientation within the gravity field allows the establishment of a lateral auxin gradient across the cap, which is transported through the lateral root cap and epidermal cells to the transition zone, where it promotes differential cellular elongation between the top and bottom flanks, leading to downward curvature. Rootward auxin transport in the peripheral tissues of the root is mediated by AUX1 and PIN2 auxin influx and efflux facilitators, respectively, as well as ABC transporters [15,16,17,18]. The PIN2 protein is localized in the plasma membrane mostly on the shootward side of the lateral cap and epidermal cells, dictating the shootward transport of auxin through cell files. Its recycling between the endosome and plasma membrane, and the regulation of its stability, are critical for its function in auxin transport and gravitropism [19]. Its abundance within the plasma membrane of transporting cells is enhanced by increased auxin levels and GOLVEN peptide signaling on the bottom flank, a process that reinforces the auxin gradient across the root tip as it moves toward the transition zone [19,20]. Furthermore, PIN2-mediated reflux of auxin from the peripheral tissues back into the vasculature stream toward the root tip also occurs at the transition zone, contributing significantly to the modulation of root gravitropism [21]. The formation of an auxin gradient across the root tip and its transport to the transition zone and main segment of the elongation zone can be followed using live reporters. One of these reporters, named DII-VENUS, encodes a protein that carries the cis-acting motifs needed for recognition by the SCFTIR1 ubiquitin–ligase complex in the presence of auxin, leading to its degradation by the proteasome [22]. Hence, the cellular fluorescence signal generated by the DII-VENUS reporter rapidly decreases as a consequence of auxin-induced reporter degradation by the proteasome [22,23]. A better understanding of the key molecular mechanisms that modulate gravity sensing and signal transduction in plants requires an accurate method to evaluate organ gravisensitivity, such that genotypes with altered gravisensitivity can be identified and further characterized. Early studies suggested that the curvature response of a plant organ to gravistimulation varies linearly as a function of the logarithm of the dose of gravistimulation, itself defined as the product of gravity intensity by time of stimulation (g.s) [24]. Quantifying tip angle for distinct doses of initial gravistimulation led to dose–response curves that fit logarithmic functions. Extension of the corresponding best-fit functions to the time axis under 1 g allowed the determination of the presentation time, defined as the threshold stimulation time needed to produce curvature (reviewed in [25]). This method has been used extensively to estimate the gravisensitivity of plant organs despite ignoring the fact that very short periods of gravistimulation well below the presentation time can still induce gravicurvature when applied repeatedly. The threshold time of intermittent gravistimulation leading to gravicurvature (the perception time) is shorter than 1 s, suggesting the gravisensing machinery is exquisitely sensitive to reorientation [26,27,28]. A re-evaluation of some of the data presented in previous presentation time studies revealed that a hyperbolic model better fits the observed data than the initially used logarithmic model [25]. Such hyperbolic models intersect the time axis at the origin, suggesting the slope of the best-fit hyperbolic model at the origin might provide a better representation of gravisensitivity than the presentation time [25]. Interestingly, a recent study using a centrifugation approach coupled with growth kinematics imaging provided support for a contribution of organ inclination, rather than gravity intensity, in shoot gravity sensing [29]. The presentation and perception times described above are much shorter than the time needed for initiation of the resulting curvature. This implies that the initial gravistimulation should be followed by a period without stimulation to allow the plant organ to develop curvature that is commensurate with the initial stimulus. The microgravity conditions encountered during spaceflight or at the International Space Station (ISS) are ideal for the implementation of such experiments [30,31,32]. Unfortunately, using either platform is very expensive and access to them is very limited. Furthermore, the use of centrifuges to create fractional gravity in space implies the creation of sharp gravity gradients between the center of the centrifuge and its periphery, which can have an unwanted impact on plant responses. To overcome these difficulties, researchers have used low-speed clinostats to mimic microgravity during the curving phase of the graviresponse. Indeed, these continuously rotating devices average the plant orientation relative to the gravity vector during each rotation cycle (reviewed in [33]). However, using this approach to define organ gravisensitivity is heavily reliant on the assumption that clinorotation does not have an impact of its own on root growth behavior. Unfortunately, published data may suggest otherwise. First, it is important to note that research teams have used clinostats to mimic microgravity in a variety of different ways, including rotating the plants at a range of angular velocities (from 0.33 to 60 RPM), with one rotation axis parallel or perpendicular to the longitudinal growth axis of the plants (horizontal vs. vertical clinorotation, respectively), or rotating in space (three-dimensional clinostats or random positioning machines) (reviewed in [34]). A recent and careful investigation of the impact of various forms of clinorotation on plant organs growth revealed that slow horizontal clinorotation at 1 RPM induces stress responses in root statocytes and lower endodermal cells, whereas fast clinorotation in the range of 60 RPM leads to the directional root growth response to a force that results from both gravity and the centrifugal acceleration [34]. These results suggest a need to re-evaluate the use of clinostats as microgravity mimics in experiments aimed at quantifying plant gravisensitivity. Considering that previous experiments aimed at evaluating the sensitivity of plant organs to gravistimulation used low-speed clinorotation to allow the development of a proportional curvature response to defined doses of gravistimulation applied before clinorotation, and given that presentation times of 0.4–5 min were previously reported for Arabidopsis thaliana organs using these methods [12,13,35,36], we set up an experiment to investigate whether low-speed clinorotation might itself trigger a directional root growth response without an initial dose of gravistimulation before clinorotation. Indeed, if seedlings are positioned vertically on a clinostat and rotation is initiated at a speed of 0.5 RPM, their organs will be exposed to a unidirectional gravistimulus over the first half-turn of clinorotation, which should last 60 s, before being exposed to a gravistimulus from the opposite direction. If the first half-turn of gravistimulation is sufficiently long enough to induce a persistent polarity in the statocytes, it should be sufficient to promote curvature at the end of clinorotation. In fact, our previous experiments aimed at evaluating the effect of clinorotation on Arabidopsis root skewing on hard agar surfaces uncovered the existence of clinostat-dependent root tip curvatures that were compatible with this “clinostat effect” [37]. To better understand the effects exerted by low-speed clinorotation on root growth behavior and their connections with gravitropism, we exposed Arabidopsis thaliana (a dicot model) and Brachypodium distachyon (a genetic model for monocot plants) seedlings, growing on agar-solidified medium, to low-speed clinorotation in the absence of a previous gravistimulus (defined as seedling reorientation away from the vertical), and analyzed their root tip responses to such clinorotation. We demonstrate the development of root tip curvature in both species at low speeds of clinorotation, and show that mutations affecting early steps of gravity sensing and/or signal transduction interfere with this clinostat effect. We also show that low-speed clinorotation leading to root tip curvature promotes the relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the side membrane of the root cap statocytes and the development of a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. We conclude that gravitropism contributes to the clinostat effect on root growth direction under low-speed clinorotation, and discuss the potential implications of these findings for our understanding of root gravisensitivity.2. Results 2.1. Low-Speed Clinorotation Triggers Directional Root Tip Curvature in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon Seedlings To investigate the effect of clinorotation on root growth behavior without prior gravistimulation, we subjected vertically grown Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedlings to low-speed clinorotation in darkness, and then measured root tip reorientation at the end of the treatment. For Arabidopsis thaliana, we used seedlings from the Col and Ws ecotypes because several mutants with defects in the early steps of gravity sensing and signal transduction are available in these backgrounds (see below). In the first assay, Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings growing on the surface of an agar-based medium in Petri dishes were subjected to low-speed (0.2 RPM) vertical clinorotation in clockwise or counterclockwise directions. The results summarized in Figure 1A,B (upper halves of the panels) indicate that the roots of Col seedlings exposed to clockwise clinorotation curved to the right, eventually reaching tip angles of around 25.5 ± 4.9 degrees, whereas those exposed to counterclockwise clinorotation curved to the left, reaching tip angles of −38.5 ± 7.1 degrees. A similar effect was also observed when Ws seedlings were tested in this assay (Figure 2A,B). The roots of seedlings that were maintained in the clinostat chamber without being clinorotated (vertical controls, labeled ST in Figure 2) did not develop tip curvature, suggesting that clinorotation is responsible for root reorientation. Clinorotation did not significantly affect the growth of wild type Col and Ws roots (Supplemental Figure S1). Figure 1.

These experiments were repeated twice, with similar results.Figure 2. Open in a new tab Gravitropism-deficient Arabidopsis mutants do not show root tip curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation: 5-day-old wild type, mutant, and transgenically rescued Arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to either 0.2 RPM vertical clinorotation or stationary growth (ST) in darkness for 18 h. Rose plots of root tip angles measured at the end of each experiment are represented for each genotype (represented at the top) and each experimental condition (represented on the left). These rose plots are split into 18 bins of 20 degrees each. The proportion of the measured population of root tip angles falling into a specific bin is represented by a wedge within that bin. The bin representing seedlings with root tips directed toward the bottom within 0 to 20 degrees of the vertical is directed to the bottom, the bin representing 80–100 degrees is directed to the right, the one representing 160–180 degrees to the top, and the one representing 260–280 degrees to the left. Photographs of representative seedlings taken at the end of each experiment are shown above each rose plot. Several alleles of (A) arg1 and (B) toc132 were tested in this experiment, along with their respective wild types, and an arg1-2 mutant line transformed with a 35Sp::ARG1 transgene (arg1-2[35S:ARG1]). nN = 12–25.To determine whether this effect is Arabidopsis-specific, we subjected Brachypodium distachyon seedlings (Bd21-3 accession) to a similar experimental protocol. Results shown in Figure 1A,B (lower halves of the panels) indicate that the seedling roots of this monocot model also responded to clockwise clinorotation by curving rightward (tip angles of 12.5 ± 2.9 degrees), whereas those exposed to counterclockwise clinorotation curved to the left (eventually reaching tip angles of −14.8 ± 1.4). The roots of stationary seedlings did not develop tip curvature (Figure 1A,B). Clinorotation did not significantly affect Brachypodium root growth relative to the stationary growth control (t-test p-value = 0.41 and 0.22). This result demonstrates that low-speed clinorotation also promotes root tip curvature in Brachypodium distachyon. A second experimental setup was designed to confirm the existence of a clinostat effect on root growth direction, relying on the two-chamber system described in the Materials and Methods section and illustrated in Supplemental Figure S2C,D. In this system, the plates loaded in chamber 1 were oriented such that seedlings were in an upright position, whereas those loaded in chamber 2 were upside down. During the first half-turn of clinorotation, the right and left sides of seedlings located in chamber 1 and chamber 2, respectively, were directed toward the gravity vector (Supplemental Figure S2C,D). When clinorotated clockwise at 0.2 RPM, chamber 1 seedlings curved to the right, whereas those exposed to counterclockwise clinorotation curved leftward (tip angles of 22.6 ± 5.1 and −25.9 ± 9.4 degrees, respectively; Supplemental Figure S3A). The opposite results were observed in chamber 2, where seedlings exposed to clockwise rotation curved leftward and those exposed to counterclockwise rotation curved rightward (tip angles of −19.2 ± 11.3 and 14.2 ± 8.6 degrees, respectively; Supplemental Figure S3A). To further confirm these observations, we subjected Bd21-3 Brachypodium distachyon seedlings to 0.2 RPM parallel clinorotation, where plates were oriented parallel to the clinostat axis, with seedlings oriented vertically at the beginning of the experiment (Supplemental Figures S2E,F and S3B). Plates were loaded back-to-back into the chamber, and clinorotation was immediately initiated. Half of the plates had seedlings with their air-exposed side facing the gravity vector during the first half-turn of clinorotation, whereas the other half had seedlings with their medium-facing side directed toward gravity. At the end of clinorotation, the root tips of a majority of tested seedlings in the first group (five out of seven) had curved away from the surface (Supplemental Figure S3B, left), whereas those from the second group (with medium-facing side directed toward gravity during the first half-turn of rotation) tended to either penetrate the agar-based medium (five out of seven seedlings tested) or skew on its surface. We also subjected Bd21-3 seedlings to 0.2 RPM horizontal clinorotation, where the plates were positioned vertically in the clinostat chamber with seedlings oriented horizontally, parallel to the clinostat axis (Supplemental Figures S2G,H and S3C). Here again, plates were loaded back-to-back into the chamber, and clinorotation was immediately initiated. At the end of clinorotation, the root tips of a vast majority of the tested seedlings (15 out of 16) whose air-exposed side faced the gravity vector during the first half-turn of clinorotation had curved away from the surface (Supplemental Figure S3C, left), whereas those with medium-exposed surfaces directed toward gravity during the first half-turn tended to penetrate the agar-based medium (8 out of 8 seedlings tested) (Supplemental Figure S3C, right). Taken together, the results from these experiments demonstrate that low-speed clinorotation triggers directional root tip curvature dependent upon both the orientation of the seedlings at the beginning of clinorotation and the polarity of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise, Figure 1; Supplemental Figure S3). In all these experiments, the roots curved in a direction defined by the side that faced gravity during the first half-turn of clinorotation, starting from a vertical root, suggesting a role for gravitropism in this response.2.2. Mutations Affecting Early Steps of Gravity Signal Transduction Interfere with the Clinostat Effect To test the contribution of gravitropism to the clinostat effect, we evaluated root curvature responses to clockwise vertical clinorotation of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with defects in early phases of gravity sensing and/or signal transduction, including two arg1 mutant lines (arg1-2 and arg1-3; [7]) and the corresponding transgenic rescue line (arg1-2[35S:ARG1]), three toc132 mutant lines (toc132-3, toc132-4, and mar2-1; [8]), and the starch-deficient pgm-1 mutant [13]. While the roots of control wild type seedlings (Col and Ws) displayed strong curvature responses to clinorotation at speeds of 0.2 RPM relative to stable non-clinorotated controls (ST), those of pgm, arg1, and toc132 mutant seedlings did not display much of a clinostat effect (Figure 2; Supplemental Figure S4A,B; Table 1). Their average root tip curvature upon clinorotation was significantly different from that of the wild type (t-test p-value < 0.05; Table 1). The root tips of pgm and arg1 mutant seedlings also displayed a more random orientation than the wild type under control growth conditions (no clinorotation; ST), indicative of gravitropism defects, whereas those of toc132/mar2 seedlings did not, in agreement with a previous report [8] (F-test p-value < 0.05; Table 1; Figure 2; Supplemental Figure S4). The roots of transgenic homozygous arg1-2 mutant seedlings expressing the 35Sp:ARG1 transgene displayed a significant clinostat effect (Table 1), demonstrating phenotype rescue by the transgene (Figure 2). Clinorotation did not alter root growth in either wild type or mutant seedlings relative to stationary controls (Supplemental Figure S1A–C). Taken together, these results support a contribution of gravitropism to the clinostat effect. Table 1.

The Speed of Clinorotation Impacts the Clinostat Effect If gravitropism is responsible for the clinostat effect, the initial period of exposure to directional gravistimulation, hence the speed of clinorotation, should impact the level of root tip curvature at the end of the experiment, with shorter periods of initial exposure (associated with higher speeds of clinorotation) resulting in lower curvatures. To test the validity of this assumption, we subjected wild type Col seedlings to clinorotation at speeds of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 RPM, and evaluated the resulting root tip curvatures at the end of clinorotation. In Figure 3, panels A and B show that lower clinorotation speeds lead to increased root tip curvature angles (more significant clinostat effects). Figure 3. Open in a new tab The speed of clinorotation affects the level of root tip curvature: (A) Representative root tip images of Arabidopsis seedlings clinorotated clockwise at the indicated speeds (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 RPM) and stationary growth (ST) in darkness for 18 h. gc represents the gravity vector at the onset of clinorotation. (B) Rose plot of the root tip angles (in degrees) at the end of clinorotation at the indicated speeds. (C,D) Root tip angles in degrees (C) and total root tip curvatures (D) reached at the end of 18 h clinorotation as functions of the duration of the first half-turn of clinorotation (half periodicity, in s). Best-fit logarithmic models (dotted lines) are represented on these graphs, whose functions are indicated at the top along with the corresponding correlation values (R2). The realization time (TR) deduced from these functions is indicated at the bottom right of each graph. n= 20. This experiment was repeated twice, with similar results.To better understand the relationship between rotation speed and resulting root tip curvature, we plotted the average values of root tip angle (Figure 3C) and total tip curvature (Figure 3D) (Y axis) over the duration of the first half-turn of clinorotation (X axis), and then modeled the results with a best-fit logarithmic function (a method analogous to that used to estimate the presentation time [25]). The best-fit models identified in these experiments closely matched the observed data, with R2 values often exceeding 0.9 (Figure 3). Their intersection with the X axis defines the minimal period of half-turn clinorotation needed to determine the polarity of root tip curvature. We named this parameter the realization time (TR). In the experiments shown in Figure 3C, the roots of wild type Col seedlings displayed a TR of 35 s. Two additional independent trials led to similar TR estimates for Arabidopsis wild type Col roots (Supplemental Figure S5). On the other hand, similar experiments carried out with two distinct mar2 (toc132) mutants showed longer realization times of 54.7 s and 62.6 s, respectively (Supplemental Figure S6A). No TR values could be assigned to the pgm1 and arg1 mutants because both developed only minor, insignificant curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation that did not fit with a logarithmic model (Supplemental Figure S6B). One limitation of the experiment described in Figure 3 is that it attempts to correlate the stimulus provided during the first half-turn of clinorotation with the final angle of curvature even though the same stimulus is provided incrementally at each cycle of clinorotation throughout the whole experiment. To investigate the possible contribution of additional rounds of clinorotation (beyond the first half-turn) to curvature specification, we modified the clinorotation experiment to first include one or more curvature-inducing cycles at the beginning of the experiment (a phase we call “inductive”), and followed it with a phase of non-inductive 3 RPM clinorotation to allow curvature development (schematized in Figure 4A, left panel). The inductive phase included one, two, three, four, or five cycles of clinorotation at a speed of 0.2 RPM. Two controls included one experiment without an inductive phase (all cycles at 3 RPM), and a second experiment with all cycles being inductive at 0.2 RPM. The results shown in Figure 4 indicate that continuous clinorotation at 3 RPM is not sufficient to induce a significant root tip curvature relative to non-clinorotated controls (ST), as expected. Similarly, neither one, two, or three cycles of inductive clinorotation were insufficient to promote the clinostat effect. However, an inductive phase of four or five cycles at 0.2 RPM followed by 18 h at 3 RPM led to root tip curvatures similar to those generated by continuous clinorotation at 0.2 RPM (Figure 4). Hence, only four inductive clinorotation cycles at 0.2 RPM are sufficient to trigger strong root tip curvature similar to that triggered by continuous rotation at this speed (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Several rounds of inductive clinorotation are needed for maximal root tip curvature response: 5-day-old wild type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Col accession) were subjected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 rounds of inductive 0.2 RPM clinorotation in darkness before being exposed to 18 h non-inductive clinorotation at 3 RPM. Root tip angles were measured at the end of each experiment and plotted over the number of inductive clinorotation rounds. The results are represented in the form of a violin chart. The box plots within each violin indicate median (horizontal bar) and mean values (X), along with the quartiles (rectangular boxes) and standard deviations (whiskers) of the distributions. One-way ANOVA analysis was performed. Different letters identify significantly different responses (Tukey’s HSD test, p < 0.05). This experiment was repeated twice, with similar results.2.4. Low-Speed Clinorotation Triggers the Formation of an Asymmetric Auxin Gradient across the Root Tip If the clinostat effect is a consequence of gravitropism, low-speed clinorotation should trigger an asymmetric auxin redistribution across the root tip, preceding the initiation of root tip curvature. To investigate this possibility, we clinorotated, at 0.2 RPM, wild type Arabidopsis thaliana Col seedlings transformed with the DII-VENUS auxin reporter [22]. Analysis of VENUS expression along the root tip of control non-rotated seedlings (ST) revealed symmetrical signals in epidermal and lateral cap cells on opposite flanks of the root tip up to the transition zone (Figure 5A). The symmetrical signal was also found across the root tips of seedlings exposed to non-inductive 3 RPM clinorotation for 1, 2, or 6 h (Figure 5A). As expected, strong signal asymmetry was observed across the root tips of 1 h gravistimulated seedlings, with a dramatic signal decrease on the lower side of the root ([22]; Figure 5A; Supplemental Figure S7A,B). Interestingly, an asymmetrical VENUS signal was also apparent across the root tip after 1 h of low-speed clinorotation (0.2 RPM), with a lower signal on the root tip side that was directed toward gravity during the first half-turn of clinorotation (Figure 5A; Supplemental Figure S7A,B). Signal asymmetry persisted after 2 and 6 h of clinorotation, although the asymmetry was weaker at these later time points than after 1 h (Figure 5A, Supplemental Figure S7A,B). Signal quantification confirmed significant signal asymmetry upon both GS and low-speed (0.2 RPM) clinorotation (Figure 5A, Supplemental Figure S7A,B). These results are compatible with the development of an auxin gradient across the root tip of low-speed-clinorotated Arabidopsis seedlings, with auxin accumulation on the side of the root facing gravity during the first half-turn of clinorotation. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Low-speed vertical clinorotation leads to asymmetric auxin distribution across the root tip: 5-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Col) expressing the DII::VENUS auxin reporter were subjected to 0.2 RPM (left) or 3 RPM (right) vertical clinorotation in darkness for the time periods indicated above each picture. Non-clinorotated (ST) and constantly gravistimulated (GS) controls were included in this experiment. Panel (A) shows representative confocal images of root tip DII::VENUS fluorescence signals under the rotation conditions and times defined at the top; the middle images show the confocal DII-VENUS fluorescence signals merged with bright field views of the same roots; the bottom images show the results of signal quantification in the form of signal intensity heatmaps generated using the LUT plug-in from the ImageJ. Scale bars represent 50 µm. Panel (B) demonstrates how low-speed clinorotation leads to mild PIN3 relocalization in the columella cells of the root cap. 5-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Col accession) expressing a PIN3-GFP construct were either clinorotated at 0.2 and 3 RPM in darkness, gravistimulated, or grown straight downward without clinorotation or gravistimulation (ST) for 0, 1, 2, or 6 h. The PIN3-GFP fluorescent signal was then analyzed by confocal microscopy. A mild polarization of the signal appeared in the columella cells of the root cap (yellow arrows) within 1 h of 0.2 RPM clinorotation and continued over a period of 6 h. Similar polarization was not seen upon 3 RPM clinorotation or when the seedlings were neither gravistimulated nor clinorotated. Quantification of VENUS signals from panel (A) were presented in Supplemental Figure S7A. In panels (A) and (B), the direction of gravity (g) at the onset of clinorotation (or gravistimulation, GS) is represented by a black arrow.If gravitropism is truly responsible for the clinostat effect, the auxin gradient developed across clinorotated roots should originate from the root cap columella cells, where a redistribution of plasma-membrane-associated PIN3 and PIN7 proteins should occur (reviewed in [1]). To test this assumption, we subjected Col seedlings expressing the PIN3-GFP transgene [38] to the same low-speed clinorotation assay and analyzed GFP fluorescence signal in the root cap at 0, 1, 2, and 6 h following the onset of clinorotation. The results shown in Figure 5B show a mild increase in PIN3-GFP signal intensity in the lateral membrane of tier 2 and 3 columella cells at the side of the roots that faced down during the first half-turn of clinorotation; this occurred within 1 h of clinorotation. The asymmetry of this PIN3-GFP signal was milder than the one observed in response to normal gravistimulation. It was still present after 2 and 6 h of clinorotation, but it was less pronounced after 6 h. No signal asymmetry was found when the roots were not stimulated (ST), or when the roots were clinorotated at the higher speed of 3 RPM, which is non-inductive (Figure 5B). To evaluate the relative timing of PIN3-GFP relocalization in the root cap statocytes and DII-VENUS gradient formation across the root tip relative to curvature initiation upon clinorotation, we quantified the root tip angle of the same clinorotated PIN3-GFP-expressing seedlings at different times following 0.2 RPM clinorotation onset. The results shown in Supplemental Figure S8 indicate the appearance of a significant curvature after 5 h of clinorotation. Although the kinetics of fluorescent marker changes have to be taken with caution considering the time needed for marker maturation during synthesis and/or marker degradation [22], we note that the appearance of asymmetrical PIN3-GFP and DII-VENUS signals in the root tips precede the initiation of the corresponding curvature (Figure 5A,B; Supplemental Figure S7). These results are compatible with the few initial rounds of clinorotation leading to PIN relocalization toward one side of the columella cells dictated by the gravistimulus imposed during the first half-turn of clinorotation, lateral auxin transport, and the resulting curvature response.2.5. The Bd21-3 and Ron-2 Brachypodium distachyon Accessions Are Differentially Responsive to Low-Speed Clinorotation Considering our observations of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with distinct abilities to develop root tip curvatures in response to low-speed clinorotation (Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure S4), we wondered whether the genetic variation existing between natural populations of Brachypodium distachyon might also be associated with distinct abilities to respond to clinorotation. To address this possibility, we subjected seedlings of the Bd21-3 and Ron-2 accessions to different speeds of vertical clinorotation (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 RPM), and then evaluated the resulting root tip curvatures. The results shown in Figure 6A demonstrate strong and weak responses to 0.1 and 0.2 RPM clinorotations, respectively, leading to a realization time (TR) of 91 s for Bd21-3. Ron-2, on the other hand, displayed no root tip curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation, preventing us from assessing the realization time for this accession. These results demonstrate the existence of a large variability between Brachypodium accessions for their abilities to develop root tip curvatures under low-speed clinorotation. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Brachypodium distachyon accessions display distinct root tip curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation: 3-day-old Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21-3 and Ron-2 accessions were subjected to clinorotation at speeds of 0 (ST control), 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 RPM for 14 h in darkness. The seedlings were photographed at the end of each experiment. Panel (A) shows representative root tip images of Bd21-3 and Ron-2 seedlings exposed to the clinorotation conditions summarized at the top. (B) Averaged root tip angles at the end of clinorotation along with their standard deviations are plotted over the time needed to complete half a turn of clinorotation in the corresponding experiment. A logarithmic model was fit to the data (dotted line) and used to calculate the realization time (TR) for responding seedlings. The function associated with the best-fit model is represented at the top of the graph along with the corresponding R2 value. Ron-2 seedlings did not respond to clinorotation, thus it was not possible to assign a specific TR value to them. n = 6–11. This experiment was repeated twice, with similar results.3. Discussion Since their inception by von Sachs in 1879 [39], clinostats have been advertised as useful systems to mimic microgravity on Earth. By constantly rotating around one or two axes, these devices simulate weightlessness by averaging a plant’s orientation relative to gravity at each rotation cycle. Consequently, the plant is never exposed to gravity from one side for long enough to trigger a tropic response. Under these conditions, the plant organs are expected to display growth behaviors that are comparable to those seen under microgravity as long as the speed of rotation remains sufficiently low to keep the centrifugal force below the limit of detection by the organism (reviewed in [34]). In plants, clinostats have been used rather effectively to evaluate the effect of microgravity on processes as diverse as tropic responses, plant morphology, metabolism, organ growth, cell division, organelle morphology, and nutrient uptake, to cite just a few examples [25,40,41,42]. They have also been extensively used to investigate plant organs’ sensitivity to gravistimulation (reviewed in [25]). Considering that repeated short periods of gravistimulation can trigger a gravitropic response [25,26,27], we wanted to reassess the assumption that low-speed clinorotation truly simulates weightlessness. Indeed, if a vertical plant is suddenly exposed to low-speed vertical clinorotation, its organs will be gravistimulated from the same side over a period corresponding to the first half-turn of rotation. If this initial half-turn of clinorotation is sufficiently long enough to trigger a response polarity, it should ultimately lead to organ curvature. This clinorotation effect should be observed with other clinorotation configurations as well, for similar reasons. In this manuscript, we use Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedling roots to test this hypothesis. We show that low-speed clinorotation under a variety of configurations triggers root tip curvature in which direction and degree are dictated by the polarity and period of rotation, respectively. Under vertical clinorotation, seedling roots responded to clockwise or counterclockwise clinorotation at speeds below 0.5 RPM by curving to the right and left, respectively, as long as the seedlings started clinorotation at a vertical orientation (Figure 1). In the two-chamber vertical clinostat system described in Supplemental Figure S2C,D, the seedlings are initially positioned upright in one of the chambers, and upside down in the second chamber. When clinorotated clockwise, the seedling roots in the first chamber curve to the right, whereas those in the second chamber curve to the left (Supplemental Figure S3A). Interestingly, during the first half-turn of clockwise clinorotation, the right flank of the seedlings is directed toward gravity in chamber 1 and away from it in chamber 2, again potentially explaining the opposite polarities of root tip curvature displayed by these seedlings at the end of the experiment. This conclusion seems reinforced by our observation of opposite responses when counterclockwise clinorotation is applied (Supplemental Figure S3A). It should be noted here that the angles of curvature reached by the roots of chamber 2 seedlings exposed to 0.2 RPM clinorotation are smaller than those displayed by chamber 1 seedlings (Supplemental Figure S3A). The reason for this difference is not clear, although it is possible that the mechanostimulus associated with quickly turning the plates 90 degrees to position them within chamber 2 before clinorotation might somewhat alter their ability to respond to gravistimulation [43]. When plates are positioned parallel to the clinostat axis, with Brachypodium seedlings oriented upright at the beginning of clinorotation (parallel clinorotation, Supplemental Figure S2E,F), forward clinorotation at 0.2 RPM results in directing the air-facing side of the seedlings to the gravity vector during the first half-turn, ultimately leading to the roots lifting off the agar surface. When clinorotated in the opposite direction, the roots tend to either penetrate the agar surface, or meander on it if they cannot penetrate (Supplemental Figure S3B). Similar results are obtained when Brachypodium seedlings are positioned horizontally on the clinostat (Supplemental Figure S3C). In all these low-speed clinorotation experiments, the roots curve toward the side that faces the gravity vector during the first half-turn of clinorotation, as long as they start in a vertical orientation and the speed of rotation is sufficiently low. Indeed, 3 RPM clinorotations do not trigger root tip curvature under these experimental conditions (Figure 4). Therefore, our results are compatible with a role for gravitropism in modulating the low-speed clinostat effect on root growth direction. If gravitropism is an integral component of the clinostat effect on root growth direction, mutations that affect gravitropism should alter the clinostat effect on root growth direction. Furthermore, the clinostat effect should be associated with the formation of a lateral auxin gradient across the root tip, a process accompanied by relocalization of the PIN3 and PIN7 auxin efflux facilitators to the lateral membrane of columella statocytes early during clinorotation (reviewed in [1]). Our results are consistent with both assumptions. Indeed, mutations that affect early phases of gravity sensing and signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana strongly affect root tip responses to low-speed clinorotation (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S4). This includes a mutation in the PGM gene, which encodes phosphoglucomutase, an enzyme that contributes to starch biosynthesis. Mutations in this gene have been reported to affect starch content in the amyloplasts of plant statocytes, thereby affecting their ability to sediment in response to gravistimulation [13]. The defect in mutant amyloplast sedimentation correlated with altered gravitropic response in roots, hypocotyls, and stems of Arabidopsis, in agreement with a role for amyloplast sedimentation in gravity sensing [44]. Importantly, previous studies of amyloplast sedimentation in the root cap statocytes of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under the same growth conditions as our study have demonstrated significant sedimentation after only 1 or 2 min of reorientation [8], which is compatible with the time needed for the clinostat to complete its first half-turn under the inductive conditions used in this project. Taken together, these results are compatible with a role for amyloplast sedimentation, during the first half-turn of clinorotation (due to plant reorientation within the gravity field), in clinostat-induced root tip curvature. Mutations in ARG1 are also shown to alter root tip responses to low-speed clinorotation in this project, a phenotype that is suppressed by expressing a wild type transgene in mutant plants (Figure 2). ARG1 and its paralog ARL2 encode J-domain membrane-associated proteins that are essential for PIN relocalization to the bottom membrane of root cap statocytes and their cytoplasmic alkalinization in response to gravistimulation [7], thereby modulating very early steps of gravity signal transduction in the statocytes. The impact of arg1 mutations on root tip curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation is again consistent with a role for gravitropism in this process. Mutations in the TOC132/MAR2 gene were previously shown to strongly affect root gravitropism in an arg1-2 mutant background while having little to no effect in a wild type ARG1 background. This strong genetic interaction between TOC132/MAR2 and ARG1 indicates a role in gravity signal transduction within the statocytes that does not impact starch accumulation or amyloplast sedimentation [8]. TOC132/MAR2 encodes a component of the translocon of the outer membrane of chloroplasts complex located on the surface of plastids, which contributes to protein import from the cytoplasm into the plastids and impacts gravity signal transduction [8,45]. In the experiments described in this manuscript, mutations in this gene strongly affected root tip curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation despite being present in a wild type ARG1 background. This result suggests that the root curvature response to clinorotation may constitute a more sensitive assay for gravitropism than a simple reorientation assay. Considering that root gravitropism typically involves the creation of a lateral auxin gradient across the root cap, followed by its propagation toward the elongation zone where it promotes differential cellular elongation and tip curvature, we used a transgenic DII-VENUS auxin reporter to document the formation of a lateral auxin gradient across clinorotated seedlings, showing signal disappearance on the flank of the root that was directed toward gravity during the first half-turn of rotation. This clinostat-induced signal gradient occurred within 1 h of clinorotation and decreased after 2 and 6 h. It occurred under low-speed clinorotation (0.2 RPM), but was not observed under non-inductive conditions at 3 RPM or in seedlings that were not clinorotated. Its intensity was lower than the sharp gradient observed in response to direct gravistimulation (Figure 5; Supplemental Figure S7). Interestingly, the PIN3 protein was also shown to relocalize to the side of the columella cells after 1 h of 0.2 RPM clinorotation. This relocalization resulted in PIN3 accumulation on the side membrane of the statocytes that was directed toward gravity during the first half-turn of clinorotation. It was less pronounced than observed in response to direct gravistimulation, and it was not observed under 3 RPM rotation (Figure 5; Supplemental Figure S7). Taken together, these results are compatible with the first half-turn of clinorotation at 0.2 RPM providing sufficient directional information to polarize the root cap statocytes, leading to PIN protein relocalization in the statocytes, auxin gradient formation along the root tip, and curvature response. The levels of PIN3 relocalization and steepness of the lateral auxin gradient triggered by 0.2 RPM clinorotation were not as strong as those established upon direct gravistimulation because the latter provides a continuous stimulus over time, with progressively decreasing inclination, whereas the stimulus provided during clinorotation occurs only for a limited time (half the period of clinorotation) before being interrupted by opposite inclination. The observation of increased curvature angles generated by clinorotation of increased periodicity is compatible with this explanation (Figure 3). We have been able to also show a logarithmic relationship between angle of curvature and period of clinorotation. When extended to the time axis, this function allows the estimation of a parameter we called realization time (TR), which we defined as the minimal period of half-turn clinorotation needed to set up a polarity of tip curvature response to clinorotation. While this approach was inspired from the presentation time analysis carried out to evaluate gravisensitivity of plant organs, it is important to recognize that the realization time parameter differs from the presentation time because in TR analysis, the same stimulus is provided at each following inductive cycle during clinorotation, whereas a single limited gravistimulus is provided prior to horizontal clinorotation in presentation time analysis. In this sense, the realization time is more reminiscent of the perception time parameter, defining sensitivities based on repeated short periods of gravistimulation. This conclusion is supported by the observation of a need for a minimum of four cycles of inductive clinorotation to allow the development of a significant curvature response at the end of the experiment (Figure 4). Future experiments will be aimed at elucidating the relationship existing between curvature response and total stimulation to evaluate possible reciprocity between number of inductive cycles and periodicity of each cycle as components of stimulation. Experiments have also been initiated to elucidate the potential impact of different speeds of clinorotation during the response (non-inductive) phase on the final curvature. Finally, it should be noted that our experiments were carried out with rather long periods of clinorotation, allowing for better reproducibility of the results (12 to 18 h). However, this implies that significant auto-straightening is likely to have occurred during such long periods of clinorotation, considering that the first signs of curvature were visible after 5 h (Supplemental Figure S7). Current research is aimed at documenting the impact of proprioception on the curvature responses to clinorotation using biometric data calculated from time-lapse images recorded using an infrared-sensitive camera mounted on the clinostat (Su et al., unpublished work). Previous reports documenting plant responses to clinorotation at different speeds demonstrated effects on organ curvatures only at higher speeds, where the organ tip appeared to reorient following the force vector resulting from both gravity and centrifugal acceleration. Clinorotation at the low speed of 1 RPM (or even 0.3 RPM in one case), did not trigger organ curvature responses [24,34,46,47,48,49]. It should be pointed out that the experiments we describe here also did not trigger any responses at 1 RPM. However, clear curvature responses were observed to clinorotations at 0.5 and 0.2 RPM. We also note that different accessions of Brachypodium distachyon displayed dramatically distinct responses to 0.2 and 0.5 RPM clinorotations, with Bd21-3 showing strong responses at 0.2 RPM and a weaker response at 0.5 RPM, whereas Ron-2 displayed no responses at all (Figure 6). Similarly, mutations affecting early steps of gravity sensing and signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana affected root curvature responses to inductive clinorotation (Figure 2). On the other hand, wild type Arabidopsis seedlings of the Col and Ws ecotypes were previously shown to display significant curvature responses to clinorotation at 1 RPM under distinct experimental conditions [37], whereas they showed no curvatures at 1 RPM in the experiments described here. We conclude that the genetic background of the plants being analyzed and the environmental and/or experimental conditions used to carry out these experiments will affect root tip curvature responses to clinorotation, emphasizing the need to carefully report both. In conclusion, our observations suggest a new method to evaluate root gravitropism, and possibly gravisensitivity, using clinorotation. We are currently taking advantage of the large variability existing between Brachypodium distachyon accessions to identify molecular mechanisms that contribute to this variability using genome-wide association studies, hoping to uncover novel mechanisms that contribute to gravity sensing and signal transduction in roots.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Plant Material and Growth Conditions Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col and Ws (originally received from ABRC, Columbus, OH, USA) and of Brachypodium distachyon Bd21-3 and Ron-2 accessions (received from the Amasino laboratory at the University of Wisconsin–Madison) were used as experimental materials in this study. Arabidopsis mutants with defects in gravity signal transduction were also used in this project, including arg1-2 (Ws background) and arg1-3 (SALK_024542, Col background) [6,7,8], pgm-1 (Col background) [8], toc132-3 (GABI_394E01, Col background) [50], toc 132-4 (SALKseq061933), and mar2-1 (Ws background) [6,8]. A transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana arg1-2 mutant expressing the 35Sp:ARG1 transgene (arg1-2[35S:ARG1]) was also used as a control [7]. Finally, transgenic lines expressing the DII::VENUS and pPIN3::PIN3-GFP reporters in the Col background were used in confocal microscopy [5,22]. Seedlings from the Col accession were chosen for most experiments because their roots display a minimal amount of root skewing on hard agar surfaces [37], a behavior that could potentially complicate interpretation of the results. Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface-sterilized, germinated, and grown on the surface of a half-strength LS medium with 0.8% agar under 16/8 h day/night cycles at 20–22 °C (cool-white LED light at ~70 µE·m−2·s−1), as described in [8]. Brachypodium distachyon seeds were dehusked and surface-sterilized with five successive 1 min washes in 95% (w/v) ethanol, and then air dried in a sterile hood for at least 20 min. Sterilized seeds were soaked with autoclaved Milli-Q water in darkness at 4 °C for 24 h. Seeds were then plated on the surface on 1% agar plates with 0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium (Sigma) and grown under red LED light at ~15 µE·m−2·s−1 (Tangkula Inc., Ontario, CA, USA) for 24 h to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to new agar plates and grown under white LED light at ~75 µE·m−2·s−1 (Tangela Inc., Ontario, CA, USA) for 5 h to stabilize the transplanted seedlings. Then, the plates were set into the clinostat chambers in the dark for an additional 4 h before clinorotation assay.4.2. Clinorotation Assays After germination using the protocols described under the subsection Plant Materials and Growth Conditions, germinated seedlings were transferred to fresh 0.5× LS with 0.8% agar-based medium, aligned at the middle of the plate with the root tips directed downward. The new plates containing these transplanted seedlings were then mounted in the clinostat chamber with root tips oriented downward, and were maintained in this position for 4 h to stabilize the transplanted seedlings before clinorotation (unless stated otherwise). After stabilization, the seedlings were subjected to either vertical or parallel clinorotation. In all but one of the clinorotation systems described below (the two-chamber vertical clinorotation system being the exception), the clinostat used an ATmega328 microcomputer to control a 12 V 350 mA stepper motor connected to a belt and gears. These were connected to a shaft with centrally mounted lightproof acrylic boxes to hold square Petri plates. For vertical clinorotation, the clinostat chamber was positioned such that the plates it contained were perpendicular to the rotation axis (Supplemental Figure S2A,B). Half of the plates were oriented such that their lids were directed to the right of the clinostat, the other half with the lids directed to the left. This allowed us to test the effects of both clockwise and counterclockwise clinorotations on seedling root growth in the same experiment. In all experiments described in this manuscript, the direction of clinorotation (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) is defined based on observations from the back side (through the agar-based medium). In some vertical clinorotation experiments, half of the plates were transferred into the clinostat chamber with seedlings oriented vertically downward (roots directed upward) so that their roots would be exposed to gravistimulation from the other side during the first half-turn of clinorotation relative to those starting the experiment in the normal upright position. In this set of experiments, clinorotation was initiated immediately after transferring the plates into the clinostat chamber. A two-chamber-based vertical clinorotation system was also designed to evaluate the clinostat effect on root tip curvature. The two-chamber-based clinostat was built by modifying a Thomas Scientific HYBAID hybridization oven. In this system, two chambers were located on opposite sides of the horizontal axis of the clinostat. The first chamber was loaded with plates carrying seedlings in an upright position, whereas chamber 2 was loaded with plates in the opposite orientation (upside down seedlings at the start of clinorotation; see Supplemental Figure S2C,D). In both chambers, half of the plates were inserted with their lids directed toward the left of the clinostat (clockwise rotation), the other half with the lids directed toward the right (counterclockwise rotation). In parallel clinorotation, the plates were positioned parallel to the axis of rotation within the clinostat chamber, with their seedlings oriented parallel to the gravity vector before clinorotation (Supplemental Figure S2E,F). The plates were positioned back-to-back in the chamber, with half of them having their lids directed toward the front of the chamber, and the other half having lids directed toward the back of the chamber. Therefore, during the first half-turn of clinorotation, the side of the roots facing the front of the plate was directed toward gravity in the first group of plates, whereas the side of the roots facing the medium was directed toward gravity in the second group of plates (Supplemental Figure S2E,F). Horizontal clinorotation was carried out by positioning the clinostat chamber in such a way that both the plates and the seedlings within them were parallel to the axis of rotation (Supplemental Figure S2G,H). Here again, the plates were positioned back-to-back in the chamber, exposing seedling roots to gravity on the side exposed to air in the first group of plates, and on the side facing the medium in the second group, during the first half-turn of clinorotation. After clinostat loading and a resting period (when applicable), the seedlings were clinorotated in darkness for 12 or 18 h (for Brachypodium and Arabidopsis seedlings, respectively) at the speeds defined in the text. At the end of clinorotation, the plates were scanned with an Epson Perfection V33 scanner, and root tip angles were measured using ImageJ. Rose plots were generated by Microsoft Excel. To generate publication-quality pictures, we used Photoshop to increase the brightness and contrast of representative images, avoiding any shape distortion.4.3. Microscopy Transgenic Col seedlings expressing the DII::VENUS and PIN3p::PIN3-GFP reporter constructs were grown for 5 days on the surface of 0.5 × LS, 0.8% agar (type E, Sigma) medium with a coverslip embedded in the center of the plates. Plates were then mounted into a clinostat and stabilized for more than 4 h in the dark to avoid mechanical stimuli. After different periods of clinorotation (defined in the text), a coverslip was placed on top of the seedlings, and the mount was transferred to the confocal microscope stage for imaging. This sandwiching approach allowed us to unambiguously relate reporter signal asymmetry to clinorotation polarity for each sample. Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope using excitation and emission wavelengths of 514 and 570 nm to detect VENUS, or 488 and 546 nm to detect PIN3-GFP. The detector gain range was set up for 730 to 850 nm and the scan mode was “by frame”. Seedlings were rotated clockwise but imaged from either side of the coverslip depending on sample setup. Signal intensity was measured using ImageJ (Plot Profile). A heatmap was generated by inputting the grey image of the signal channel and using the Look-Up Tables (LUTs) plug-in from ImageJ to reflect the difference in intensity by color [51].Acknowledgments We thank Daniel Woods from Rick Amasino’s laboratory and Marisa Otegui for the generous gift of plant materials.
