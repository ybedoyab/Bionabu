    "abstract": "Abstract The advent of civilian spaceflight challenges scientists to precisely describe the effects of spaceflight on human physiology, particularly at the molecular and cellular level. Newer, nanopore-based sequencing technologies can quantitatively map changes in chemical structure and expression at single molecule resolution across entire isoforms. We perform long-read, direct RNA nanopore sequencing, as well as Ultima high-coverage RNA-sequencing, of whole blood sampled longitudinally from four SpaceX Inspiration4 astronauts at seven timepoints, spanning pre-flight, day of return, and post-flight recovery. We report key genetic pathways, including changes in erythrocyte regulation, stress induction, and immune changes affected by spaceflight. We also present the first m6A methylation profiles for a human space mission, suggesting a significant spike in m6A levels immediately post-flight. These data and results represent the first longitudinal long-read RNA profiles and RNA modification maps for each gene for astronauts, improving our understanding of the human transcriptome’s dynamic response to spaceflight. Subject terms: RNA sequencing, Gene expression",
    "introduction": "Introduction Both short- and long-term missions into space are correlated with a variety of acute physiological effects, affecting diverse organ and cellular systems1–3. Astronauts generally experience performance impairment in a wide variety of activities post-spaceflight, requiring reconditioning routines to regain preflight performance4. Significant changes also occur within the circulatory and hematological system during spaceflight, on both a molecular and physiological level, which likely contributes to these effects5. Ground studies collecting transcriptomic profiles of human subjects have attempted to characterize the impact of individual components of spaceflight, such as radiation or microgravity exposure6,7, the latter being simulated with a parabolic flight8. With regard to direct spaceflight exposure, the available transcriptomic data is even more limited, focused on a few specific assays, either sequencing the human IgM repertoire following long-term spaceflight9, measuring the proteome of exhaled breath condensate after long-term spaceflight10, or examining gene expression profiles from astronaut hair follicle samples after long stays on the International Space Station11. However, beyond this limited work, there is scant data on the impact of human spaceflight on the transcriptome beyond the NASA Twins Study (1-year mission), and almost no data from short-duration missions. Moreover, there are no single-molecule, direct RNA datasets from astronauts, which can help detail changes in RNA methylation and base modifications while also capturing expression and isoform changes. To address this gap in transcriptome knowledge, eleven different biospecimen types underwent four types of high-throughput sequencing for each of the four civilian astronauts on the Inspiration4 (I4) mission12, including genomics, transcriptomics, immune profiles, microbiome, and some clinical blood tests13. Long read sequencing (LRS) technologies have potentially relevant clinical applications14, since they can capture both splicing and expression differences in full-length transcripts; nanopore long-read direct-RNA sequencing15 is additionally advantageous since it provides per-base epitranscriptomic data (e.g., m6A modification sites)16. Here, we generated LRS samples taken before the flight (L-92, L-44, L-3 days), the day of landing (R + 1), and in recovery periods (R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days) after a 3-day spaceflight from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. A battery of computational and analytical approaches were deployed on these samples, including edgeR, DESeq2, ONT tools, Gene set co-regulation analysis (GESECA)17–19, as well as orthogonal sequencing on the Ultima UG100 platform, which generated an average of 413 million reads per sample. These data provided an opportunity to discern the utility of LRS technologies in studying the I4, as well as future astronaut cohorts, and will also enable meta-analyses in conjunction with other NASA Open Science Data Repository (NASA OSDR, https://osdr.nasa.gov/) short-read and single-cell data sets. We present these data sets and algorithmic methods as foundational functional genomics resources for human spaceflight, as part of a roadmap for future bioinformatics data analysis techniques for LRS data. These current results are in line with the mission of NASA OSDR, which aims to standardize procedures for future spaceflight missions and open science, enabling comprehensive comparisons between these astronaut and model cohorts20. We also implemented methodologies which allow for examination of differences in expression, splicing behavior, and methylation (m6A) at the same time. As such, we can observe molecular changes underlying blood transcriptome dynamics across an astronaut’s journey to space and back, which show thousands of changes across several hundred specific genes, some of which recapitulate known stress markers of the vasculature and immune system, as well as signatures of m6A changes, isoform switching, and hematopoiesis regulation that appear upon landing back on Earth.",
    "methods": "Methods IRB statement The study design conforms with all relevant ethical regulations related to human subject research. All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at the SpaceX headquarters (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. The study was conducted in accordance with the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were not compensated for their participation in this study. Direct RNA sequencing Total RNA was processed and sequenced as described in Collection of Biospecimens from the Inspiration4 Mission Establishes the Standards for the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)12. Briefly, total RNA was isolated using the direct-RNA kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) from whole blood samples from three pre-flight time points L-92, L-44, L-3, one post-flight time point R + 1, and three recovery period time points R + 45, R + 82, and R + 194. Basecalling was performed with Guppy version 6.2.1, and alignment of raw nanopore events to the basecalled sequences was done with the f5c module eventalign version 1.149. Quality assessment was performed with pycoQC version 2.5.0.2150 and MultiQC version 1.13.dev051 (Supplementary Data 7). Differential gene expression analysis The reads were aligned to the Gencode v41 human transcriptomic reference22 with minimap2 version 2.24-r112252. First, the pipeline maintained by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, pipeline-transcriptome-de21, was used to quantify transcripts and to subsequently perform the differential expression analysis. pipeline-transcriptome-de performs the quantification with salmon53, accounting for multi-mapping reads; therefore, we included the highest-scoring secondary minimap2 alignments (minimap2 switch -p1.0) in the input for the pipeline. Additionally, the sub-2Kbp read lengths (median length between 517 and 1331, with one outlier of 279, Supplementary Data 7) were insufficient to perform differential transcript usage analyses47, and we focused on the differential gene expression results, which pipeline-transcriptome-de generates with edgeR17 while collapsing transcripts into respective genes. On the other hand, however, we also planned to perform differential methylation analyses, and tools that detect m6A modifications, such as m6anet31, require that secondary alignments be filtered out. To (1) match the input requirements of m6anet that prohibit multi-mapping reads, (2) compare the collapsed edgeR results to a pipeline that performs gene quantification by design, and (3) assess the effect of aligning reads to the whole genome rather than to the transcriptome, we separately aligned the reads to the human reference genome hg3823 with minimap2 with the parameters recommended for direct-RNA data, retaining only the primary mappings (-x splice -uf -k14 --secondary=no). We thereafter processed these data with the subread module featureCounts version 2.0.124 to perform gene quantification, and subsequently analyzed differential expression with SARTools version 1.8.125, a package wrapping DESeq2 version 1.36.018. As DESeq2 and edgeR employ different approaches to log2(FoldChange) shrinkage, the determination of significance was based solely on the magnitude of the p values reported by both; only the genes that were identified as significantly differentially expressed by both tools (FDR-adjusted p value < 0.05) were considered as such. Covariates to account for inter-astronaut variability were included when performing both DESeq2 and edgeR analysis. For comparisons where multiple time-points were grouped as either preflight or postflight, each sequence run was treated as an independent replicate. Gene set co-regulation analysis Given high correlation of results between featureCounts and salmon, per-gene counts were averaged between the two tools. These values, normalized by library size, were supplied to GESECA19, and co-regulation of MSigDb C2 pathways (curated gene sets)26,27 was inferred. Pathways were deemed significantly variable if the reported adjusted p value fell below 0.05. For each significantly variable pathway and at each timepoint, the median z-scored expression value of genes in the pathway was calculated. Next, to determine the pattern in the pathway variability upon return from spaceflight, per pathway, we fitted a linear regression on the median z-scores at pre-flight timepoints as a time series (i.e., values of −92, −44, −3), obtained a prediction of the z-score at the return timepoint (+1) and calculated a value, dz, of how much the observed value at R + 1 differed from the predicted value; examples of this approach are illustrated on Fig. 3. The pathways were ranked by this value, from highest (most disrupted by spaceflight) to lowest (continuing a pre-flight trend). Transcription factor enrichment analysis Gene annotations within Supplementary Data 2 were converted to gene names utilizing gProfiler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/convert)54. The resulting gene list was input into the ChEA3 digital web server (https://maayanlab.cloud/chea3/)55. The mean rank results were exported and reported in Supplementary Table 4. m6A modification analysis The transcriptomic alignments were filtered to retain primary mappings only (minimap2 switch --secondary=no) to match the input requirements of m6anet. m6anet version 1.1.0 was then employed to annotate sites of m6A modifications with methylation probabilities, and methylKit version 0.99.232 was used to discover differentially methylated sites between conditions in all profiles; sites were deemed significant if the resultant methylKit q value fell below 0.01, as recommended by the tool’s authors. De novo transcriptome analysis The genomic alignments were collapsed with StringTie version 2.2.156 and compared with GffCompare version 0.11.234. The GffCompare.tracking file was further processed in R version 4.2.1/RStudio version 1.2.5001. Average read length was calculated with samtools version 1.16.157. The R + 45 timepoint was excluded since the sample for subject C003 exhibited a low average read length (279 bp) and transcript-level precision (Supplementary Data 7). Ultima genomics deep-RNA sequencing Poly-A mRNA was isolated from approximately 50–500 ng of total RNA using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs). The resulting mRNA was converted into cDNA using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs). After end repair/dA-tailing, adapter ligation, and USER-enzyme digestion, indexing PCR was carried out using the UG Library Amplification Kit (Ultima Genomics) with custom indexing primers that amplify the TruSeq Read1 and Read 2 sequences, but are appended with Ultima Genomics adapter sequences. After 11 cycles of PCR, amplification products were cleaned up using a 1.0x ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Overhang generation was carried out using components from the UG Library Amplification Kit (Ultima Genomics) and material was size selected using a dsSPRI approach with 0.6x/0.85x AMPure XP beads. Quality control of the resulting libraries was carried out using the DNA High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer Reagents (Agilent Technologies) and concentrations were measured via Qubit HS DNA Quantification Kit (Thermo Fisher). Sample pools were then seeded onto UG sequencing beads, pre-enriched, and amplified by emulsion PCR, leveraging UG’s automated sequencing bead preparation system (AMP). Sequencing was performed on UG100 sequencing systems, running 464 flow-cycles (116 cycles across each of the four nucleotides [T, G, C, A]). Ultima genomics sequencing analysis We aligned the reads to the human reference genome hg3823 with STAR version 2.7.10b58. We sorted the resulting.bam files utilizing samtools version 1.16.157. We thereafter processed these alignments with the subread module featureCounts version 2.0.124 to verify de novo transcript expression, and subsequently extracted normalized counts for correlative analysis with SARTools version 1.8.125, a package wrapping DESeq2 version 1.36.018.

    "results": "Results Differential gene expression and gene set co-regulation analyses reveal genes and pathways associated with the effects of short-term space flight We evaluated two distinct approaches to gene expression quantification and detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the direct RNA data (see “Methods”). First, the raw basecalled reads were processed with the pipeline maintained by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), pipeline-transcriptome-de21; the pipeline considers reads aligned to the Gencode v41 transcriptomic reference22, includes multi-mapping reads, quantifies expression based on individual transcripts, collapses transcript counts into gene counts, and obtains sets of DEGs using the edgeR package17. In addition, we quantified expression based on reads aligned to the human genome reference hg3823 using the subread package24, excluding multi-mapping reads, and obtained sets of DEGs via the SARTools package25, a wrapper for DESeq218. Both pipelines were applied to the data in the context of multiple flight, recovery, and longitudinal profiles (Supplementary Data 1). A full flow cell was used for each astronaut and time-point; the four astronauts were grouped together as biological replicates for downstream analysis. All runs aligned more than 400,000 long-reads, with an average length of 580 base pairs. While the two computational approaches produced results that slightly differed in DEGs determined to be significant (DESeq2 or edgeR p value < 0.05) (Supplementary Data 2), they overwhelmingly agreed on their relative abundance estimates for gene quantification (median Pearson’s r = 0.98, Fig. 1a) and the direction of their change in all profiles (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1. Comparison of DGE pipelines. Open in a new tab Correlation of (a) per-gene counts obtained from featureCounts and salmon, and of (b) log2(FoldChange) values obtained from SARTools and pipeline-transcriptome-de. p values are obtained from a Wald test (DESeq2) and a generalized linear model test (edgeR), respectively, and plotted following FDR adjustment; in green, significant (p value < 0.05) as reported by both pipelines, in red, only reported as significant by pipeline-transcriptome-de, and in blue, only reported as significant by SARTools.Next, gene set co-regulation analysis (GESECA)19 was used to examine changes in known pathways and molecular functions (MSigDb category C2, curated gene sets)26,27, specifically for those pathways deviating from the baseline value (median z-scored expression of associated genes +1.86, Supplementary Data 3) at the R + 1 timepoint (immediately post-flight). The variation of 789 out of the 6336 assessed pathways was significantly co-regulated (adjusted p value < 0.05). Although 2829 downregulated genes were present at R + 1 (z-score below 0), the vast majority of significantly variable pathways was driven by upregulated genes (z-score above 0, Supplementary Fig. 1). Top variable pathways included erythrocyte CO2 and O2 takeup and release, as well as the Biocarta AHSP pathway (hemoglobin’s chaperone; a superset of the erythrocyte-associated pathways) (Fig. 2). Longitudinal changes for the identified differentially enriched pathways showed two distinct trends (Supplementary Data 3, value of dz); the trend was either disrupted immediately following space flight (Fig. 3a) or was continued from pre-flight before returning to baseline in recovery (Fig. 3b). While most altered heme pathways were marked by increased expression of genes when returning to Earth, two pathways for erythrocytes showed distinct responses. Specifically, the data demonstrated both a decrease in erythrocyte-associated pathways for erythrocyte CO2 and O2 takeup (and release), as well as an increase in Steiner membrane genes, which indicates the significant spaceflight-induced stress on erythrocytes in particular.

On the right: examples of calculation of dz, the deviation of the z-score from the value expected under the assumption that the pathway is not disrupted.Transcription factor enrichment analysis was then utilized to identify commonly shared transcription factors by genes (Supplementary Data 4) across all time points. The top three suggested regulators, based on a combined CHIP-seq and co-expression analysis, KLF1, GATA1, and TAL1 are all key transcription factors (TFs) for erythrocyte differentiation28–30, underscoring the changes in these cell types and also suggesting possible TF-based drivers for the trends observed within the GESECA analysis. m6A modification analysis identifies sites of differential longitudinal methylation Next, we identified the sites of m6A modification across isoforms31 and their degree of change, leveraging the single molecular nature of the ONT platform to find sites differentially methylated across the pre-flight, recovery, and longitudinal post-flight profiles (q value < 0.01, methylKit32) (Supplementary Data 5). This analysis showed 1190 m6A modification sites with statistically significant differences for at least one particular longitudinal comparison. The significant sites were annotated to 200 total transcripts, sourced from 193 gene loci. Notably, the largest set of differentially methylated positions occurred on the day of returning back to Earth (timepoint R + 1 compared to all pre-flight timepoints), which we correlated with the variability of pathways identified by GESECA. Per pathway, the number of differentially methylated sites per gene ranged from 0 to 4.4 (Fig. 4a). Among the pathways with the highest density of differentially methylated sites, once again the erythrocyte-associated pathways were enriched, as well as their superset, the Biocarta alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) pathway (Fig. 4b).

Each dot in the box plot represents the value of differential methylation percentage of a site on any gene in the given pathway; the site’s location in the exon or the UTR is color-coded. Boxes represent the range between Q1 and Q3 (the first and the third quartile) of the distribution, thick lines within the boxes annotate the median value, and the whiskers extend by 1.5×(Q3 − Q1) in each direction. Pathways that are also significantly variable by expression (GESECA adjusted p value < 0.05; obtained from a permutation test) are annotated in red. Gene sets can be explored further at: https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb.Comparing the 193 gene loci which contained DRACH (D = A, G or U; H = A, C or U) sequence motifs33 with differentially methylated sites (minimum 20x coverage, q value < 0.01, methylKit) with the set of 440 differentially expressed gene loci (FDR-adjusted p value < 0.05, either salmon or SARTools), we found an overlap of 53 genes, indicating that most of the post-transcriptional m6A regulation is distinct from the set of DEGs. When individual genes were considered, the genes with the highest number of differentially methylated sites did not contribute to significantly differentially expressed pathways, but among the top 30 such genes, 11 were part of the HSIAO_HOUSEKEEPING_GENES pathway (Supplementary Fig. 2), and included genes for alpha-globin (HBA), beta-globin (HBB), and also human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. These data indicate the transcription levels of the genes responding to spaceflight are distinct from their specific RNA modifications, and that this is consistent across the immune and hematopoietic-related pathways. We next examined the m6A differences observed within the flight profile (FP) and return profile (RP) comparisons (FP1, RP1, and RP2, defined in Supplementary Data 1). Overall, 331 positions were hypermethylated (q value < 0.01, methylKit) and, among these, seven genes (PFN1, LAPTM5, RPS4X, HBA1, MT-ND4, HBA2, HBA2.1) demonstrated a statistically significant downregulation in methylation 45 days after landing (q value < 0.01, methylKit). An additional two transcripts (MT-ND1, MT-RNR1) demonstrated a statistically significant downregulation 82 days after landing (q value < 0.01, methylKit). 208 positions were noted to contain decreased levels of m6A (q value < 0.01, methylKit). Amongst these, one (SLC25A37) position demonstrated increased methylation 45 days after landing (q value < 0.01, methylKit). No additional positions demonstrated increased methylation (q value < 0.01, methylKit) in the long-term follow-up timepoints, which indicates that spaceflight has its most significant effect on m6A methylation levels in the days immediately following return to Earth. De novo transcriptome analysis reveals uniquely expressed transcripts at L-92, L-3, R + 1 and R + 194 De novo transcriptome analysis was then utilized to reveal transcripts unique to particular time points. Unlike differential expression analysis, which captures differences across timepoints based on known annotations, de novo transcriptome analysis captures unannotated transcript variants specific to a particular timepoint or sample type. Ignoring loci not detected within the samples, we note that the overall sensitivity of the full transcript-level analysis, as defined by GffCompare34, is on average 8.5%, revealing 3’ enrichment of many reads (Supplementary Data 6), which is expected given the polyA-priming protocol. One particular sample (November for the C003 astronaut) had lower coverage, leading to the exclusion of this time point from subsequent analysis. Additionally, when ignoring completely unannotated putative transcripts, we report that the average precision, as defined by GffCompare, was 52.4% (Supplementary Data 6). We focused on transcripts found consistently across all crew members for subsequent de novo analyses. The transcripts were then analyzed in the context of two overlapping time periods: (1) the period leading up to the space flight and return; and (2) the period starting with spaceflight and leading into post-flight recovery. Therefore, first, the set of samples consisting of preflight and return timepoints (L-92, L-44, L-3, and R + 1) was examined. There were eight unique transcripts for L-92 (Supplementary Data 8: June), no unique transcripts for L-44 (Supplementary Data 8: August), seven unique transcripts for L-3 (Supplementary Data 8: September Pre-Flight) and six unique transcripts for R + 1 (Supplementary Data 8: September Post-Flight, top). In the set of samples consisting of return and recovery timepoints (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, and R + 194), there were five unique transcripts for R + 1 (Supplementary Data 8: September Post-Flight, bottom), one unique transcript for R + 82 (Supplementary Data 8: December) and no unique transcripts for R + 194 (Supplementary Data 8: March). These unique RNAs represent perhaps a very specific response to spaceflight, which have not been observed in previous studies. Since spaceflight can introduce changes in differential expression and methylation, we next examined if the stress could also lead to aberrant splicing. Each transcript was assigned a GffCompare transcript classification code, which represents the detection of intron retention or other changes in isoform state34. The i4 transcriptome data showed six transcripts with complete intron chain retention (“=” label), nine transcripts with intron chain retention over a segment (“c” label), one transcript with single intron retention (“n” label), five transcripts characterized by a unannotated intron (“j” label), one transcript with a single exon fragment partially covering an intronic region (“e” label), two transcripts with unannotated exons (“o” label), and three transcripts entirely unannotated and not found in any reference transcriptome (“u” label). These results (Supplementary Data 8) show the capacity for novel isoform state and discovery in the direct RNA-seq data. Of note, we also identified two transcripts which could be uniquely associated with the R + 1 timepoint (Supplementary Data 8), and downregulated during the recovery phase upon returning to Earth. The first of these was ENST00000686344.2, within the ENSG00000274015 gene locus, located on chr14 between coordinates 63,642,035 and 63,665,593, which is an uncharacterized lncRNA annotation. The second is a completely novel, unannotated putative transcript variant, described by the “u” GffCompare transcript classification code34, located on chromosome 10 between coordinates 3,408,655 and 3,409,052 (Supplementary Fig. 3). To confirm these isoforms, we performed deep RNA-seq on the same whole blood samples using the Ultima Genomics UG100 system. The platform generated an average of 411.5 million reads per sample, with a mapping percentage greater than 90% for all samples (Supplementary Data 6). As a result, an average of 28,438 genes were detected, with close correspondence between all samples (Fig. 5A). When comparing the nanopore quantification of gene expression profiles to the Ultima data, we observed fair correlation (R2 > 0.56–0.71) with the UG100 platform (Fig. 5B). We determined that 23/25 (92%) of the time point specific genomic loci demonstrated a consistent pattern of cDNA read alignments (Supplementary Data 6). While this did not include the transcript variant on chromosome 10 within Supplementary Fig. 3, we were able to confirm the expression of the uncharacterized R + 1 associated lncRNA transcript ENST00000686344.2, within the ENSG00000274015 gene locus (Fig. 5C).

    "discussion": "Discussion All prior transcriptomics data from spaceflight studies have used short-read sequencing14, and these LRS data showed a unique signature of disrupted gene regulation for astronauts from the Inspiration4 mission, particularly in the hematological system. These data provide the first map of m6A changes from spaceflight, which showed their largest degree of changes on the day of landing (R + 1)15,16. The majority of significantly altered pathways was driven by upregulated genes, implying that transcriptional and pathway activity went into figurative “overdrive” following the short-term, high-elevation space flight. This significant shift in the expression profile may be explained by both direct and indirect effects of spaceflight, such as radiation, changes in gravity, circadian rhythm disruptions, mission stress, and possibly medications, although none were indicated by the crew records. The direct-RNA sequencing data also detailed splicing events for isoforms, while confirming that aberrant splicing in the crew was very low overall. Although many categories of significantly up-regulated pathways were observed, exposure to space radiation in particular may underlie a number of cancer-related pathways, including “TSAI response to radiation therapy” and “Wiemann telomere shortening and chronic liver damage.” The set of downregulated pathways after landing was distinct, and notably included genes associated with breathing regulation (e.g., CO2 and O2 takeup and release by erythrocytes). These pathways were also among the top differentially methylated, suggesting a potential convergence between expression and methylation in regulating these critical functions. These results also mirror reported effects of partial gravity and microgravity on lung function, and spaceflight-related hypercapnia linked to increased CO2 levels35,36. Future studies should consider the impact of air quality, convection, and microgravity-related pulmonary challenges for expression and methylation differences. Also, while these samples had to be sequenced on Earth, the development of space-specific, microgravity-compatible sequencing protocols37,38 foreshadows the exciting possibility of real-time monitoring of changes of the transcriptome and epitranscriptome for future missions. Moreover, radiation levels should continue to be monitored during missions, since such stressors can alter telomere dynamics, which have been observed before in the NASA Twins Study39,40 and for mountaineers climbing Mt. Everest25. In addition to capturing differential expression, LRS technologies also capture transcript splicing, potentially allowing for the identification of new regulatory mechanisms and interactions between these two modalities of RNA41. In fact, a recent study examining murine skeletal muscle post-spaceflight found that differential splicing accounted for more variation than differential expression42. LRS can potentially identify all such differences, given that the nearly all transcripts are shorter than the theoretical maximum sequencing length for Nanopore platforms (2.3 Mb)43,44. Nevertheless, limitations remain within the library preparation and technical specifications (e.g., 3’ enrichment) of different LRS platforms43, and improvements in these protocols and informatics methods will help profiling for future samples. To gain greater confidence in the DEG set, we compared two different approaches to multi-mapping reads and DEG detection. Namely, secondary mappings are not included in the featureCounts quantification, whereas secondary mappings contribute partial counts in salmon, and are likely the source of differences in assigning the counts to three closely homologous genes DEFA1/1B/3 (Fig. 2c). Additionally, the associated differential expression callers, DESeq2 and edgeR, respectively, utilize slightly different heuristics to perform log2 fold change estimates, resulting in many genes uniquely identified by the salmon-edgeR pipeline mapping to the y-axis of Fig. 1b. While accounting for secondary mappings with salmon could be argued to be the more sound approach, this calls for further assessment and discussion of methods to be used for analyses of direct-RNA data, as retention of secondary mappings is incompatible with m6A callers such as m6anet, which was recently shown to be the most accurate m6A caller45. Despite these differences attributed to isoforms, we nonetheless have found that both methods produced similar quantification results, with high correlation (>0.98), and their per-gene averages were used for gene set co-regulation analyses (GESECA). When the significance of differential expression of individual genes is to be considered, intersecting the gene sets reported by DESeq2 and edgeR was preferred. A current limitation specific to nanopore LRS is the loss of coverage at the 5’ end of transcripts, since the assay uses polyA-trail priming46,47. As expected, we observed this truncation, resulting in lower sensitivity for some reference transcripts (Supplementary Data 6). It has also been suggested that future improvements in the Nanopore hardware will address this limitation48. To minimize this issue, those with other classification codes were restricted to those events observed across all crew members and all timepoints, and thus likely represent real biological variation. Moreover, we verified the associated transcripts with orthogonal data from the Ultima Genomics UG100 platform. While these samples provide remarkable coverage, further comparative analysis is necessary to optimize the application of current differential expression models. Also, transcript-specific and functional follow-up assays are necessary to determine the potential significance of these findings and potential use of these transcripts as biomarkers, as well as additional data from other crews and missions. Moreover, given the civilian background of the I4 astronauts, we note that transcriptomic changes can be confounded with age, biological sex, preflight preparation differences, or divergent postflight recovery procedures, and thus utilized tools that aim to model and normalize such variation. Finally, given the recently proposed missions with private (SpaceX, Axiom, Sierra Space) and public (NASA, ESA, and JAXA) space entities, there will be continued opportunities to replicate these findings and to continue to discover new features of the transcriptome. This will include continued mapping of space-related gene expression responses, m6A site changes, and isoform-switching events that are associated with spaceflight. Also, in-flight testing of direct RNA sequencing has been demonstrated on the ISS, which indicates that LRS of RNA could also be applied for crew studies in future missions, including for blood, microbial, and environmental samples. Optimization and deployment of these single molecule technologies can also aid in the plans for lunar laboratories, in-flight clinical diagnostics, and the ability to discover non-canonical bases or new base modifications for lunar and exploration-class (e.g., Mars) missions.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166648 PMID: 38862496 Abstract The advent of civilian spaceflight challenges scientists to precisely describe the effects of spaceflight on human physiology, particularly at the molecular and cellular level. Newer, nanopore-based sequencing technologies can quantitatively map changes in chemical structure and expression at single molecule resolution across entire isoforms. We perform long-read, direct RNA nanopore sequencing, as well as Ultima high-coverage RNA-sequencing, of whole blood sampled longitudinally from four SpaceX Inspiration4 astronauts at seven timepoints, spanning pre-flight, day of return, and post-flight recovery. We report key genetic pathways, including changes in erythrocyte regulation, stress induction, and immune changes affected by spaceflight. We also present the first m6A methylation profiles for a human space mission, suggesting a significant spike in m6A levels immediately post-flight. These data and results represent the first longitudinal long-read RNA profiles and RNA modification maps for each gene for astronauts, improving our understanding of the human transcriptome’s dynamic response to spaceflight. Subject terms: RNA sequencing, Gene expression Here the authors explore the role of chemical modifications within RNA molecules in spaceflight response, observing increased m6A mRNA modifications immediately post-spaceflight in gene markers associated with stress response.Introduction Both short- and long-term missions into space are correlated with a variety of acute physiological effects, affecting diverse organ and cellular systems1–3. Astronauts generally experience performance impairment in a wide variety of activities post-spaceflight, requiring reconditioning routines to regain preflight performance4. Significant changes also occur within the circulatory and hematological system during spaceflight, on both a molecular and physiological level, which likely contributes to these effects5. Ground studies collecting transcriptomic profiles of human subjects have attempted to characterize the impact of individual components of spaceflight, such as radiation or microgravity exposure6,7, the latter being simulated with a parabolic flight8. With regard to direct spaceflight exposure, the available transcriptomic data is even more limited, focused on a few specific assays, either sequencing the human IgM repertoire following long-term spaceflight9, measuring the proteome of exhaled breath condensate after long-term spaceflight10, or examining gene expression profiles from astronaut hair follicle samples after long stays on the International Space Station11. However, beyond this limited work, there is scant data on the impact of human spaceflight on the transcriptome beyond the NASA Twins Study (1-year mission), and almost no data from short-duration missions. Moreover, there are no single-molecule, direct RNA datasets from astronauts, which can help detail changes in RNA methylation and base modifications while also capturing expression and isoform changes. To address this gap in transcriptome knowledge, eleven different biospecimen types underwent four types of high-throughput sequencing for each of the four civilian astronauts on the Inspiration4 (I4) mission12, including genomics, transcriptomics, immune profiles, microbiome, and some clinical blood tests13. Long read sequencing (LRS) technologies have potentially relevant clinical applications14, since they can capture both splicing and expression differences in full-length transcripts; nanopore long-read direct-RNA sequencing15 is additionally advantageous since it provides per-base epitranscriptomic data (e.g., m6A modification sites)16. Here, we generated LRS samples taken before the flight (L-92, L-44, L-3 days), the day of landing (R + 1), and in recovery periods (R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days) after a 3-day spaceflight from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. A battery of computational and analytical approaches were deployed on these samples, including edgeR, DESeq2, ONT tools, Gene set co-regulation analysis (GESECA)17–19, as well as orthogonal sequencing on the Ultima UG100 platform, which generated an average of 413 million reads per sample. These data provided an opportunity to discern the utility of LRS technologies in studying the I4, as well as future astronaut cohorts, and will also enable meta-analyses in conjunction with other NASA Open Science Data Repository (NASA OSDR, https://osdr.nasa.gov/) short-read and single-cell data sets. We present these data sets and algorithmic methods as foundational functional genomics resources for human spaceflight, as part of a roadmap for future bioinformatics data analysis techniques for LRS data. These current results are in line with the mission of NASA OSDR, which aims to standardize procedures for future spaceflight missions and open science, enabling comprehensive comparisons between these astronaut and model cohorts20. We also implemented methodologies which allow for examination of differences in expression, splicing behavior, and methylation (m6A) at the same time. As such, we can observe molecular changes underlying blood transcriptome dynamics across an astronaut’s journey to space and back, which show thousands of changes across several hundred specific genes, some of which recapitulate known stress markers of the vasculature and immune system, as well as signatures of m6A changes, isoform switching, and hematopoiesis regulation that appear upon landing back on Earth.Results Differential gene expression and gene set co-regulation analyses reveal genes and pathways associated with the effects of short-term space flight We evaluated two distinct approaches to gene expression quantification and detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the direct RNA data (see “Methods”). First, the raw basecalled reads were processed with the pipeline maintained by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), pipeline-transcriptome-de21; the pipeline considers reads aligned to the Gencode v41 transcriptomic reference22, includes multi-mapping reads, quantifies expression based on individual transcripts, collapses transcript counts into gene counts, and obtains sets of DEGs using the edgeR package17. In addition, we quantified expression based on reads aligned to the human genome reference hg3823 using the subread package24, excluding multi-mapping reads, and obtained sets of DEGs via the SARTools package25, a wrapper for DESeq218. Both pipelines were applied to the data in the context of multiple flight, recovery, and longitudinal profiles (Supplementary Data 1). A full flow cell was used for each astronaut and time-point; the four astronauts were grouped together as biological replicates for downstream analysis. All runs aligned more than 400,000 long-reads, with an average length of 580 base pairs. While the two computational approaches produced results that slightly differed in DEGs determined to be significant (DESeq2 or edgeR p value < 0.05) (Supplementary Data 2), they overwhelmingly agreed on their relative abundance estimates for gene quantification (median Pearson’s r = 0.98, Fig. 1a) and the direction of their change in all profiles (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1. Comparison of DGE pipelines. Open in a new tab Correlation of (a) per-gene counts obtained from featureCounts and salmon, and of (b) log2(FoldChange) values obtained from SARTools and pipeline-transcriptome-de. p values are obtained from a Wald test (DESeq2) and a generalized linear model test (edgeR), respectively, and plotted following FDR adjustment; in green, significant (p value < 0.05) as reported by both pipelines, in red, only reported as significant by pipeline-transcriptome-de, and in blue, only reported as significant by SARTools.Next, gene set co-regulation analysis (GESECA)19 was used to examine changes in known pathways and molecular functions (MSigDb category C2, curated gene sets)26,27, specifically for those pathways deviating from the baseline value (median z-scored expression of associated genes +1.86, Supplementary Data 3) at the R + 1 timepoint (immediately post-flight). The variation of 789 out of the 6336 assessed pathways was significantly co-regulated (adjusted p value < 0.05). Although 2829 downregulated genes were present at R + 1 (z-score below 0), the vast majority of significantly variable pathways was driven by upregulated genes (z-score above 0, Supplementary Fig. 1). Top variable pathways included erythrocyte CO2 and O2 takeup and release, as well as the Biocarta AHSP pathway (hemoglobin’s chaperone; a superset of the erythrocyte-associated pathways) (Fig. 2). Longitudinal changes for the identified differentially enriched pathways showed two distinct trends (Supplementary Data 3, value of dz); the trend was either disrupted immediately following space flight (Fig. 3a) or was continued from pre-flight before returning to baseline in recovery (Fig. 3b). While most altered heme pathways were marked by increased expression of genes when returning to Earth, two pathways for erythrocytes showed distinct responses. Specifically, the data demonstrated both a decrease in erythrocyte-associated pathways for erythrocyte CO2 and O2 takeup (and release), as well as an increase in Steiner membrane genes, which indicates the significant spaceflight-induced stress on erythrocytes in particular.

On the right: examples of calculation of dz, the deviation of the z-score from the value expected under the assumption that the pathway is not disrupted.Transcription factor enrichment analysis was then utilized to identify commonly shared transcription factors by genes (Supplementary Data 4) across all time points. The top three suggested regulators, based on a combined CHIP-seq and co-expression analysis, KLF1, GATA1, and TAL1 are all key transcription factors (TFs) for erythrocyte differentiation28–30, underscoring the changes in these cell types and also suggesting possible TF-based drivers for the trends observed within the GESECA analysis.m6A modification analysis identifies sites of differential longitudinal methylation Next, we identified the sites of m6A modification across isoforms31 and their degree of change, leveraging the single molecular nature of the ONT platform to find sites differentially methylated across the pre-flight, recovery, and longitudinal post-flight profiles (q value < 0.01, methylKit32) (Supplementary Data 5). This analysis showed 1190 m6A modification sites with statistically significant differences for at least one particular longitudinal comparison. The significant sites were annotated to 200 total transcripts, sourced from 193 gene loci. Notably, the largest set of differentially methylated positions occurred on the day of returning back to Earth (timepoint R + 1 compared to all pre-flight timepoints), which we correlated with the variability of pathways identified by GESECA. Per pathway, the number of differentially methylated sites per gene ranged from 0 to 4.4 (Fig. 4a). Among the pathways with the highest density of differentially methylated sites, once again the erythrocyte-associated pathways were enriched, as well as their superset, the Biocarta alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) pathway (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4. Pathways with most differentially methylated genes.

Each dot in the box plot represents the value of differential methylation percentage of a site on any gene in the given pathway; the site’s location in the exon or the UTR is color-coded. Boxes represent the range between Q1 and Q3 (the first and the third quartile) of the distribution, thick lines within the boxes annotate the median value, and the whiskers extend by 1.5×(Q3 − Q1) in each direction. Pathways that are also significantly variable by expression (GESECA adjusted p value < 0.05; obtained from a permutation test) are annotated in red. Gene sets can be explored further at: https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb.Comparing the 193 gene loci which contained DRACH (D = A, G or U; H = A, C or U) sequence motifs33 with differentially methylated sites (minimum 20x coverage, q value < 0.01, methylKit) with the set of 440 differentially expressed gene loci (FDR-adjusted p value < 0.05, either salmon or SARTools), we found an overlap of 53 genes, indicating that most of the post-transcriptional m6A regulation is distinct from the set of DEGs. When individual genes were considered, the genes with the highest number of differentially methylated sites did not contribute to significantly differentially expressed pathways, but among the top 30 such genes, 11 were part of the HSIAO_HOUSEKEEPING_GENES pathway (Supplementary Fig. 2), and included genes for alpha-globin (HBA), beta-globin (HBB), and also human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. These data indicate the transcription levels of the genes responding to spaceflight are distinct from their specific RNA modifications, and that this is consistent across the immune and hematopoietic-related pathways. We next examined the m6A differences observed within the flight profile (FP) and return profile (RP) comparisons (FP1, RP1, and RP2, defined in Supplementary Data 1). Overall, 331 positions were hypermethylated (q value < 0.01, methylKit) and, among these, seven genes (PFN1, LAPTM5, RPS4X, HBA1, MT-ND4, HBA2, HBA2.1) demonstrated a statistically significant downregulation in methylation 45 days after landing (q value < 0.01, methylKit). An additional two transcripts (MT-ND1, MT-RNR1) demonstrated a statistically significant downregulation 82 days after landing (q value < 0.01, methylKit). 208 positions were noted to contain decreased levels of m6A (q value < 0.01, methylKit). Amongst these, one (SLC25A37) position demonstrated increased methylation 45 days after landing (q value < 0.01, methylKit). No additional positions demonstrated increased methylation (q value < 0.01, methylKit) in the long-term follow-up timepoints, which indicates that spaceflight has its most significant effect on m6A methylation levels in the days immediately following return to Earth.De novo transcriptome analysis reveals uniquely expressed transcripts at L-92, L-3, R + 1 and R + 194 De novo transcriptome analysis was then utilized to reveal transcripts unique to particular time points. Unlike differential expression analysis, which captures differences across timepoints based on known annotations, de novo transcriptome analysis captures unannotated transcript variants specific to a particular timepoint or sample type. Ignoring loci not detected within the samples, we note that the overall sensitivity of the full transcript-level analysis, as defined by GffCompare34, is on average 8.5%, revealing 3’ enrichment of many reads (Supplementary Data 6), which is expected given the polyA-priming protocol. One particular sample (November for the C003 astronaut) had lower coverage, leading to the exclusion of this time point from subsequent analysis. Additionally, when ignoring completely unannotated putative transcripts, we report that the average precision, as defined by GffCompare, was 52.4% (Supplementary Data 6). We focused on transcripts found consistently across all crew members for subsequent de novo analyses. The transcripts were then analyzed in the context of two overlapping time periods: (1) the period leading up to the space flight and return; and (2) the period starting with spaceflight and leading into post-flight recovery. Therefore, first, the set of samples consisting of preflight and return timepoints (L-92, L-44, L-3, and R + 1) was examined. There were eight unique transcripts for L-92 (Supplementary Data 8: June), no unique transcripts for L-44 (Supplementary Data 8: August), seven unique transcripts for L-3 (Supplementary Data 8: September Pre-Flight) and six unique transcripts for R + 1 (Supplementary Data 8: September Post-Flight, top). In the set of samples consisting of return and recovery timepoints (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, and R + 194), there were five unique transcripts for R + 1 (Supplementary Data 8: September Post-Flight, bottom), one unique transcript for R + 82 (Supplementary Data 8: December) and no unique transcripts for R + 194 (Supplementary Data 8: March). These unique RNAs represent perhaps a very specific response to spaceflight, which have not been observed in previous studies. Since spaceflight can introduce changes in differential expression and methylation, we next examined if the stress could also lead to aberrant splicing. Each transcript was assigned a GffCompare transcript classification code, which represents the detection of intron retention or other changes in isoform state34. The i4 transcriptome data showed six transcripts with complete intron chain retention (“=” label), nine transcripts with intron chain retention over a segment (“c” label), one transcript with single intron retention (“n” label), five transcripts characterized by a unannotated intron (“j” label), one transcript with a single exon fragment partially covering an intronic region (“e” label), two transcripts with unannotated exons (“o” label), and three transcripts entirely unannotated and not found in any reference transcriptome (“u” label). These results (Supplementary Data 8) show the capacity for novel isoform state and discovery in the direct RNA-seq data. Of note, we also identified two transcripts which could be uniquely associated with the R + 1 timepoint (Supplementary Data 8), and downregulated during the recovery phase upon returning to Earth. The first of these was ENST00000686344.2, within the ENSG00000274015 gene locus, located on chr14 between coordinates 63,642,035 and 63,665,593, which is an uncharacterized lncRNA annotation. The second is a completely novel, unannotated putative transcript variant, described by the “u” GffCompare transcript classification code34, located on chromosome 10 between coordinates 3,408,655 and 3,409,052 (Supplementary Fig. 3). To confirm these isoforms, we performed deep RNA-seq on the same whole blood samples using the Ultima Genomics UG100 system. The platform generated an average of 411.5 million reads per sample, with a mapping percentage greater than 90% for all samples (Supplementary Data 6). As a result, an average of 28,438 genes were detected, with close correspondence between all samples (Fig. 5A). When comparing the nanopore quantification of gene expression profiles to the Ultima data, we observed fair correlation (R2 > 0.56–0.71) with the UG100 platform (Fig. 5B). We determined that 23/25 (92%) of the time point specific genomic loci demonstrated a consistent pattern of cDNA read alignments (Supplementary Data 6). While this did not include the transcript variant on chromosome 10 within Supplementary Fig. 3, we were able to confirm the expression of the uncharacterized R + 1 associated lncRNA transcript ENST00000686344.2, within the ENSG00000274015 gene locus (Fig. 5C).

These data provide the first map of m6A changes from spaceflight, which showed their largest degree of changes on the day of landing (R + 1)15,16. The majority of significantly altered pathways was driven by upregulated genes, implying that transcriptional and pathway activity went into figurative “overdrive” following the short-term, high-elevation space flight. This significant shift in the expression profile may be explained by both direct and indirect effects of spaceflight, such as radiation, changes in gravity, circadian rhythm disruptions, mission stress, and possibly medications, although none were indicated by the crew records. The direct-RNA sequencing data also detailed splicing events for isoforms, while confirming that aberrant splicing in the crew was very low overall. Although many categories of significantly up-regulated pathways were observed, exposure to space radiation in particular may underlie a number of cancer-related pathways, including “TSAI response to radiation therapy” and “Wiemann telomere shortening and chronic liver damage.” The set of downregulated pathways after landing was distinct, and notably included genes associated with breathing regulation (e.g., CO2 and O2 takeup and release by erythrocytes). These pathways were also among the top differentially methylated, suggesting a potential convergence between expression and methylation in regulating these critical functions. These results also mirror reported effects of partial gravity and microgravity on lung function, and spaceflight-related hypercapnia linked to increased CO2 levels35,36. Future studies should consider the impact of air quality, convection, and microgravity-related pulmonary challenges for expression and methylation differences. Also, while these samples had to be sequenced on Earth, the development of space-specific, microgravity-compatible sequencing protocols37,38 foreshadows the exciting possibility of real-time monitoring of changes of the transcriptome and epitranscriptome for future missions. Moreover, radiation levels should continue to be monitored during missions, since such stressors can alter telomere dynamics, which have been observed before in the NASA Twins Study39,40 and for mountaineers climbing Mt. Everest25. In addition to capturing differential expression, LRS technologies also capture transcript splicing, potentially allowing for the identification of new regulatory mechanisms and interactions between these two modalities of RNA41. In fact, a recent study examining murine skeletal muscle post-spaceflight found that differential splicing accounted for more variation than differential expression42. LRS can potentially identify all such differences, given that the nearly all transcripts are shorter than the theoretical maximum sequencing length for Nanopore platforms (2.3 Mb)43,44. Nevertheless, limitations remain within the library preparation and technical specifications (e.g., 3’ enrichment) of different LRS platforms43, and improvements in these protocols and informatics methods will help profiling for future samples. To gain greater confidence in the DEG set, we compared two different approaches to multi-mapping reads and DEG detection. Namely, secondary mappings are not included in the featureCounts quantification, whereas secondary mappings contribute partial counts in salmon, and are likely the source of differences in assigning the counts to three closely homologous genes DEFA1/1B/3 (Fig. 2c). Additionally, the associated differential expression callers, DESeq2 and edgeR, respectively, utilize slightly different heuristics to perform log2 fold change estimates, resulting in many genes uniquely identified by the salmon-edgeR pipeline mapping to the y-axis of Fig. 1b. While accounting for secondary mappings with salmon could be argued to be the more sound approach, this calls for further assessment and discussion of methods to be used for analyses of direct-RNA data, as retention of secondary mappings is incompatible with m6A callers such as m6anet, which was recently shown to be the most accurate m6A caller45. Despite these differences attributed to isoforms, we nonetheless have found that both methods produced similar quantification results, with high correlation (>0.98), and their per-gene averages were used for gene set co-regulation analyses (GESECA). When the significance of differential expression of individual genes is to be considered, intersecting the gene sets reported by DESeq2 and edgeR was preferred. A current limitation specific to nanopore LRS is the loss of coverage at the 5’ end of transcripts, since the assay uses polyA-trail priming46,47. As expected, we observed this truncation, resulting in lower sensitivity for some reference transcripts (Supplementary Data 6). It has also been suggested that future improvements in the Nanopore hardware will address this limitation48. To minimize this issue, those with other classification codes were restricted to those events observed across all crew members and all timepoints, and thus likely represent real biological variation. Moreover, we verified the associated transcripts with orthogonal data from the Ultima Genomics UG100 platform. While these samples provide remarkable coverage, further comparative analysis is necessary to optimize the application of current differential expression models. Also, transcript-specific and functional follow-up assays are necessary to determine the potential significance of these findings and potential use of these transcripts as biomarkers, as well as additional data from other crews and missions. Moreover, given the civilian background of the I4 astronauts, we note that transcriptomic changes can be confounded with age, biological sex, preflight preparation differences, or divergent postflight recovery procedures, and thus utilized tools that aim to model and normalize such variation. Finally, given the recently proposed missions with private (SpaceX, Axiom, Sierra Space) and public (NASA, ESA, and JAXA) space entities, there will be continued opportunities to replicate these findings and to continue to discover new features of the transcriptome. This will include continued mapping of space-related gene expression responses, m6A site changes, and isoform-switching events that are associated with spaceflight. Also, in-flight testing of direct RNA sequencing has been demonstrated on the ISS, which indicates that LRS of RNA could also be applied for crew studies in future missions, including for blood, microbial, and environmental samples. Optimization and deployment of these single molecule technologies can also aid in the plans for lunar laboratories, in-flight clinical diagnostics, and the ability to discover non-canonical bases or new base modifications for lunar and exploration-class (e.g., Mars) missions.Methods IRB statement The study design conforms with all relevant ethical regulations related to human subject research. All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at the SpaceX headquarters (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. The study was conducted in accordance with the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were not compensated for their participation in this study.Direct RNA sequencing Total RNA was processed and sequenced as described in Collection of Biospecimens from the Inspiration4 Mission Establishes the Standards for the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)12. Briefly, total RNA was isolated using the direct-RNA kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) from whole blood samples from three pre-flight time points L-92, L-44, L-3, one post-flight time point R + 1, and three recovery period time points R + 45, R + 82, and R + 194. Basecalling was performed with Guppy version 6.2.1, and alignment of raw nanopore events to the basecalled sequences was done with the f5c module eventalign version 1.149. Quality assessment was performed with pycoQC version 2.5.0.2150 and MultiQC version 1.13.dev051 (Supplementary Data 7).Differential gene expression analysis The reads were aligned to the Gencode v41 human transcriptomic reference22 with minimap2 version 2.24-r112252. First, the pipeline maintained by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, pipeline-transcriptome-de21, was used to quantify transcripts and to subsequently perform the differential expression analysis. pipeline-transcriptome-de performs the quantification with salmon53, accounting for multi-mapping reads; therefore, we included the highest-scoring secondary minimap2 alignments (minimap2 switch -p1.0) in the input for the pipeline. Additionally, the sub-2Kbp read lengths (median length between 517 and 1331, with one outlier of 279, Supplementary Data 7) were insufficient to perform differential transcript usage analyses47, and we focused on the differential gene expression results, which pipeline-transcriptome-de generates with edgeR17 while collapsing transcripts into respective genes. On the other hand, however, we also planned to perform differential methylation analyses, and tools that detect m6A modifications, such as m6anet31, require that secondary alignments be filtered out. To (1) match the input requirements of m6anet that prohibit multi-mapping reads, (2) compare the collapsed edgeR results to a pipeline that performs gene quantification by design, and (3) assess the effect of aligning reads to the whole genome rather than to the transcriptome, we separately aligned the reads to the human reference genome hg3823 with minimap2 with the parameters recommended for direct-RNA data, retaining only the primary mappings (-x splice -uf -k14 --secondary=no). We thereafter processed these data with the subread module featureCounts version 2.0.124 to perform gene quantification, and subsequently analyzed differential expression with SARTools version 1.8.125, a package wrapping DESeq2 version 1.36.018. As DESeq2 and edgeR employ different approaches to log2(FoldChange) shrinkage, the determination of significance was based solely on the magnitude of the p values reported by both; only the genes that were identified as significantly differentially expressed by both tools (FDR-adjusted p value < 0.05) were considered as such. Covariates to account for inter-astronaut variability were included when performing both DESeq2 and edgeR analysis. For comparisons where multiple time-points were grouped as either preflight or postflight, each sequence run was treated as an independent replicate.Gene set co-regulation analysis Given high correlation of results between featureCounts and salmon, per-gene counts were averaged between the two tools. These values, normalized by library size, were supplied to GESECA19, and co-regulation of MSigDb C2 pathways (curated gene sets)26,27 was inferred. Pathways were deemed significantly variable if the reported adjusted p value fell below 0.05. For each significantly variable pathway and at each timepoint, the median z-scored expression value of genes in the pathway was calculated. Next, to determine the pattern in the pathway variability upon return from spaceflight, per pathway, we fitted a linear regression on the median z-scores at pre-flight timepoints as a time series (i.e., values of −92, −44, −3), obtained a prediction of the z-score at the return timepoint (+1) and calculated a value, dz, of how much the observed value at R + 1 differed from the predicted value; examples of this approach are illustrated on Fig. 3. The pathways were ranked by this value, from highest (most disrupted by spaceflight) to lowest (continuing a pre-flight trend).Transcription factor enrichment analysis Gene annotations within Supplementary Data 2 were converted to gene names utilizing gProfiler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/convert)54. The resulting gene list was input into the ChEA3 digital web server (https://maayanlab.cloud/chea3/)55. The mean rank results were exported and reported in Supplementary Table 4.m6A modification analysis The transcriptomic alignments were filtered to retain primary mappings only (minimap2 switch --secondary=no) to match the input requirements of m6anet. m6anet version 1.1.0 was then employed to annotate sites of m6A modifications with methylation probabilities, and methylKit version 0.99.232 was used to discover differentially methylated sites between conditions in all profiles; sites were deemed significant if the resultant methylKit q value fell below 0.01, as recommended by the tool’s authors.De novo transcriptome analysis The genomic alignments were collapsed with StringTie version 2.2.156 and compared with GffCompare version 0.11.234. The GffCompare.tracking file was further processed in R version 4.2.1/RStudio version 1.2.5001. Average read length was calculated with samtools version 1.16.157. The R + 45 timepoint was excluded since the sample for subject C003 exhibited a low average read length (279 bp) and transcript-level precision (Supplementary Data 7).Ultima genomics deep-RNA sequencing Poly-A mRNA was isolated from approximately 50–500 ng of total RNA using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs). The resulting mRNA was converted into cDNA using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs). After end repair/dA-tailing, adapter ligation, and USER-enzyme digestion, indexing PCR was carried out using the UG Library Amplification Kit (Ultima Genomics) with custom indexing primers that amplify the TruSeq Read1 and Read 2 sequences, but are appended with Ultima Genomics adapter sequences. After 11 cycles of PCR, amplification products were cleaned up using a 1.0x ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Overhang generation was carried out using components from the UG Library Amplification Kit (Ultima Genomics) and material was size selected using a dsSPRI approach with 0.6x/0.85x AMPure XP beads. Quality control of the resulting libraries was carried out using the DNA High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer Reagents (Agilent Technologies) and concentrations were measured via Qubit HS DNA Quantification Kit (Thermo Fisher). Sample pools were then seeded onto UG sequencing beads, pre-enriched, and amplified by emulsion PCR, leveraging UG’s automated sequencing bead preparation system (AMP). Sequencing was performed on UG100 sequencing systems, running 464 flow-cycles (116 cycles across each of the four nucleotides [T, G, C, A]).Ultima genomics sequencing analysis We aligned the reads to the human reference genome hg3823 with STAR version 2.7.10b58. We sorted the resulting.bam files utilizing samtools version 1.16.157. We thereafter processed these alignments with the subread module featureCounts version 2.0.124 to verify de novo transcript expression, and subsequently extracted normalized counts for correlative analysis with SARTools version 1.8.125, a package wrapping DESeq2 version 1.36.018.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (737.4KB, pdf) Peer Review File (2.2MB, pdf) 41467_2024_48929_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (187.6KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Information Supplementary Data 1 (10.4KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 2 (535.7KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 3 (114.2KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 4 (165.2KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 5 (705.4KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 6 (12.6KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 7 (535.1KB, zip) Supplementary Data 8 (12KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (3.7MB, pdf) Acknowledgements C.E.M. thanks the WorldQuant Foundation, the GI Research Foundation, Katherine & John Bleckman Foundation, NASA (NNX14AH50G, NNX17AB26G, 80NSSC22K0254, NNH18ZTT001N-FG2, 80NSSC23K0832), the National Institutes of Health (R01MH117406, P01CA214274 R01CA249054, R01AI151059), and the LLS (MCL7001-18, LLS 9238-16).

    "abstract": "Abstract The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of spaceflight on the human body. Biospecimen samples were collected from four crew members longitudinally before (Launch: L-92, L-44, L-3 days), during (Flight Day: FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (Return: R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days) spaceflight, spanning a total of 289 days across 2021-2022. The collection process included venous whole blood, capillary dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX Dragon capsule HEPA filter, and skin biopsies. Venous whole blood was further processed to obtain aliquots of serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In total, 2,911 sample aliquots were shipped to our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays and biobanking. This paper provides an overview of the extensive biospecimen collection and highlights their processing procedures and long-term biobanking techniques, facilitating future molecular tests and evaluations.As such, this study details a robust framework for obtaining and preserving high-quality human, microbial, and environmental samples for aerospace medicine in the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) initiative, which can aid future human spaceflight and space biology experiments.

    "introduction": "Introduction Our human space exploration efforts are at a unique transition point in history, with more crewed launches and human presence in space than ever before1. We can attribute this to the commercial spaceflight sector entering an industrial renaissance, with multiple companies forming collaborative and competitive networks to send commercial astronauts into space. The recent advancements in human space exploration offer a significant chance to gather more biological research samples and enhance our comprehension of spaceflight’s effects on human health. This is vital, as our knowledge of the biological reactions to the unique environment of space, marked by microgravity and the space radiation, remains incomplete2. The impact of spaceflight on human health includes musculoskeletal deconditioning3, cardiovascular adaptations4, vision changes5, space motion sickness6, neurovestibular changes7, immune dysfunction8, and increased risk of rare cancers9, among other changes2. However, we are still at the initial stages of documenting biological responses to spaceflight exposure at the molecular and cellular resolution. Prior work has characterized molecular changes that occur during spaceflight in astronauts. These include changes in cytokine profiles8,10,11, urinary albumin abundance12, and hemolysis13. Furthermore, multiomic assays have provided genomic maps of structural changes in DNA14–16, RNA expression profiles11,17,18, sample-wide protein measurements17,19,20, and metabolomic status17. Additionally, International Space Station (ISS) surfaces have been studied with longitudinal microbial profiles to track microbial pathogenicity and evolution to assess their potential influence on crew health21,22. To better improve our understanding of both human and microbial biology in space, it is critical that these analyses continue and expand as more spacecraft and stations are built and flown. Combining and comparing work from prior missions in these new spacecraft and stations is especially important to overcome the small sample sizes and highlights a need for standardization between missions. In addition, recruiting large cohorts of astronauts is difficult, as the ISS typically can only house up to six astronauts at a time. As of the time of writing, only 647 humans have been to space, starting with the launch of Yuri Gagarin in 1961. Studies have spanned the Vostok program, Project Mercury, the Voskhod program, Project Gemini, Project Apollo, the Soyuz program, the Salyut space stations, MIR, the Space Shuttle Program, SkyLab, Tiangong Space Station, and the ISS. From the breadth of experiments that have been performed on the ISS, only a minority have specifically been human research-oriented23,24, and just a subset involve omics studies. The NASA Twin Study created the most in-depth multi-omic study of astronauts prior to Inspiration4, but was limited to one astronaut and one ground control17. These factors have limited the statistical power of astronaut omic experiments and increased the difficulty of providing robust scientific conclusions. Standardizing biospecimen collections across multiple missions will create larger sample sets needed to draw these conclusions. Here, we establish the standard biospecimen sample collection and banking procedures for the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA). A key goal of SOMA is to standardize biospecimen collection and processing for spaceflight, to generate high-quality multi-omics data across spaceflight investigations, and to enable follow-up experiments with viably frozen cells and biobanked samples. This paper provides sample collection methods built for standardized field collections across different crews and missions. We cover the decentralized sample collection process from the Inspiration4 (I4) mission from the point of collection to the preservation of samples for downstream biochemical and omics processing at our centralized lab at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM). These protocols can produce synchronized datasets with enhanced statistical strength, amplifying our scientific findings from spaceflight studies. Additionally, we showcase metrics related to sample collection outputs, references of past astronaut sample collections in scientific publications, and suggestions to refine sample collection for upcoming missions. In its inaugural use case, these samples were collected from the I4 astronaut cohort and are currently in use for several other missions (Polaris Dawn, Axiom-2), which will enable continued utilization for future crewed space missions.",
    "methods": "Methods Venous blood draw Venipuncture was performed on each subject using a BD Vacutainer® Safety-Lok™ blood collection set (BD Biosciences, #367281) and a Vacutainer one-use holder (BD Biosciences, 364815). The puncture site was located near the cubital fossa and was sterilized with a BZK antiseptic towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Blood was collected into 1 serum separator tube (SST, BD Biosciences: #367987, Lot: #1158449, #1034773), 2 cell processing tubes (CPT, BD Biosciences: #362753, Lot: #1133477, #1012161), 1 blood RNA tube (bRNA, PAXgene: #762165, Lot: #1021333), 1 cell-free DNA BCT (cfDNA BCT, Streck: #230470, Lot: #11530331), and 4 K2 EDTA blood collection tubes (BD Biosciences, #367844, Lot: #0345756) per crew member per time point. For samples collected in Hawthorne, blood was drawn at SpaceX headquarters, then immediately transported to USC for processing. Samples collected at Cape Canaveral were processed on-site. Blood tube processing For processing, serum separator tubes (SST) were centrifuged at 1300x g for 10 minutes. 500uL aliquots of serum were aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes (ThermoFisher, 3741-WP1D-BR) and stored at -80 °C. SST tubes were recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. Cell processing tubes were centrifuged at 1800xg for 30 minutes. Plasma was aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at -80 °C. 5 mL of 2% FBS (ThermoFisher, #26140079) in PBS (ThermoFisher, #10010023) was added to the CPT tube to resuspend PBMCs. PBMC suspension was transferred to a clean 15 mL conical tube. The total volume was brought to 15 mL with 2% FBS in PBS. The tube was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 300x g. Supernatant was discarded. PBMCs were resuspended 6 mL of 10% DMSO (Millipore Sigma, #D4540-500mL) in FBS. 1 mL of PBMCs were moved to 6 cryogenic vials (Corning, #8672). Cryovials were placed in a Mr. FrostyTM (ThermoFisher, #5100-0001) and stored at -80 °C. CPTs were recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. There was one outlier to this sample collection, the R + 194 timepoint, where CPT sodium citrate tubes were used (BD Biosciences, Cat no. 362760). cfDNA BCTs were centrifuged at 300xg for 20 minutes. Plasma was transferred to a 15 mL conical tube. Plasma was centrifuged 5000xg for 10 minutes. 500uL aliquots of plasma were aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at -80 °C. cfDNA BCTs were recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. PAXgene blood RNA tubes were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, tubes were left upright for a minimum of 2 hours before freezing at −20 °C. For RNA extraction, tubes were thawed and processed with the PAXgene blood RNA kit (Qiagen, #762164). Extracellular Vesicles and Particles (EVPs) Isolation One 4 mL K2 EDTA tube was shipped on ice overnight to WCM for processing. Blood was centrifuged at 500x g for 10 minutes, then plasma was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C for EVP isolation. Plasma volumes ranged between 0.6 - 1.7 ml. Plasma was later thawed for downstream processing, when concentrations were measured. Plasma samples were thawed on ice, and EVPs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (Hoshino et al., 2020). Samples were centrifuged at 12,000x g for 20 minutes to remove microvesicles, then EVPs were collected by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Coulter Optima XE or XPE ultracentrifuge at 100,000x g for 70 minutes. EVPs were then washed in PBS and pelleted again by ultracentrifugation at 100,000x g for 70 minutes. The final EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS. Dried blood spot (DBS) Crew members warmed their hands and massaged their finger towards the fingertip to enrich blood flow toward the puncture site. The puncture site was sterilized using a BZK antiseptic towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Skin was punctured using a contact-activated lancet (BD Biosciences, #366593) or a 21-gauge needle (BD Biosciences, #305167), depending on crew member preference. Capillary blood was collected onto the Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS cards (Cytiva, #10534612). Blood was transferred by touching only the blood droplet to the surface of the DBS card. DBS cards were stored at room temperature with a desiccant pack (Cytiva, #10548239). Saliva To collect crude saliva, crew members uncapped and spit into a sterile, PCR-clean, 5 mL screw-cap tube (Eppendorf, 30122330). Crew spit repeatedly until at least 1 mL was collected. Saliva was transported to a sterile flow hood and separated into 500uL aliquots. Aliquots were frozen at -80 °C. To collect preserved saliva, crew members used the OMNIgene ORAL kit (OME-505). Crew members spit into the kit’s tube until they reached the fill line. The tube was re-capped, which released the preservative liquid. Tubes were inverted to mix the saliva and preservative before being placed at −20 °C for storage. After all timepoints were collected, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein kit (Qiagen, #47054). Sample concentrations were measured with Qubit high sensitivity dsDNA and RNA platform. Proteins were quantified with the Pierce™ Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, #A53225) on Promega GloMax Plate Reader. Urine Crew members urinated into sterile specimen containers (Thermo Scientific, #13-711-56). The container was stored at 4 C until it was prepared for long-term storage. To prepare urine samples for long-term storage, urine was aliquoted into 1 mL, 15 mL, and 50 mL tubes. Half of the urine was immediately placed at −80 °C. The other half had urine conditioning buffer (Zymo, #D3061-1-140) added to the sample before placing in the -80 °C freezer. Stool collection Crew members isolated a stool sample using a paper toilet accessory (DNA Genotek, OM-AC1). Stool was transferred into and OMNIgene•GUT tube (DNAgenotek, OMR−200) and an OMNImet•GUT tube (DNA Genotek, ME−200). Tubes were placed at -80 °C for long-term storage. For nucleic acid extraction, 200uL of each tube was allocated for DNA extraction with the QIAGEN PowerFecal Pro kit and 200uL was allocated to RNA extraction with the QIAGEN PowerViral kit. The remaining sample was split into 500uL aliquots and re-stored at -80 °C. Swab collection Crew members put on gloves and remove a sterile DNA/RNA swab (Isohelix, SK-4S) from its packaging. For collection of the postauricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, toe web space, and capsule environment regions, swabs were dipped in nuclease-free water (this step was skipped for oral and nasal swabs) for ground collections. For in-flight collections, HFactor hydrogen infused water was used in place of nuclease-free water. Each body location was swabbed for 30 seconds, using both sides of the swab. Swabs were then placed in 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes containing 400uL of DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo). The tip of the swab was broken off so that only the swab tip was stored in the Matrix 2D Screw Tube. Tubes were stored at 4 C. Skin biopsies Skin biopsies were performed on the deltoid region of the arm. Each site was prepared by application of ChloraPrep and anesthesia was induced with administration of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. A trephine punch was used to remove a 3- or 4-mm diameter piece of skin. The resected piece was cut into approximately 1/3 and 2/3 sections. The smaller piece was added to a formalin-filled specimen jar. The larger piece was placed in a cryovial and stored at -80 °C. Surgical defects were closed with 1 or 2 5-0 or 4-0 nylon sutures. HEPA filter HEPA Filter was taken apart and sectioned under a chemical hood to avoid contamination. The filter contained two parts, an activated carbon component and a HEPA filter. The activated carbon component was discarded and the filter was sectioned using a sterile blade. Sections were placed in individual specimen containers and stored at −20 °C.

    "results": "Results Biospecimen collection overview We formulated and executed a sampling plan that spans a wide range of biospecimen samples: venous blood, capillary dried blood spots (DBSs), saliva, urine, stool, skin swabs, skin biopsies, and environmental swabs (Fig. 1a). The collection of various types of samples covered the scope of previous assays on astronaut samples (Supplementary Table 1), but also enabled newer omics technologies, such as spatially resolved, single-molecule, and single-cell assays. Fig. 1. Biospecimen Samples and Collection Locations. Open in a new tab a List of biospecimen samples collected over the course of the study. b Timepoints for each biospecimen sample collection. “L-” denotes the number of days prior to launch. “R + ” denotes the number of days after return to Earth. “FD” denotes which day of the flight a sample was collected. c Location of each collection timepoint.For the I4 mission, sample collection spanned three-time points pre-launch (L-92, L-44, L-3 days), three-time points during flight (Flight Day 1 (FD1), FD2, FD3), and four-time points post-return (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days). Venous blood, urine, stool, and skin biopsies were collected during ground timepoints only, while capillary DBSs, saliva, and skin swabs were collected both on the ground and during flight (Fig. 1b). Environmental swabs of the Dragon capsule were collected pre-flight in the crew training capsule and during flight in the spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral (Fig. 1b). Samples were collected across a variety of locations based on the crew’s training and travel schedule. L-92 and L-44 were collected in Hawthorne, CA at SpaceX Headquarters, L-3 and R + 1 were collected at Cape Canaveral, FL at a facility near the launch site. FD1, FD2, and FD3 were collected inside the Dragon capsule while in orbit. R + 45 was collected at the crew members’ individual locations (which spanned the US States NY, NJ, TN, and WA), R + 82 was collected at Weill Cornell Medicine, NY and R + 194 was collected at Baylor College of Medicine, TX (Fig. 1c). All samples from ground timepoints were processed within 16 hours of collection. All samples from the flight were processed immediately after retrieval from the flight. Samples were stored at −80 °C at each site immediately after processing and aliquoting (processing steps are outlined below). All samples were shipped via FedEx using Overnight Shipping to Weill Cornell Medicine for storage in the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank (CAMbank) within 1 week of collection on dry ice in styrofoam boxes and spent <2 days in transit. No samples were shipped on a Thursday or Friday to avoid weekend shipping delays. All samples arrived at Weill Cornell Medicine with dry-ice still in the packaging and samples frozen. Samples were immediately transferred to −80 °C for long-term storage and biobanking. Any exceptions to this process will be noted below. In total, we collected 2,911 sample aliquots, which were then processed in our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays (Supplementary Table 2). Some samples were processed immediately at field laboratory facilities (Supplementary Data Fig. 1). DNA and RNA yields are also reported below from collection kits (saliva and stool) after arrival at WCM. Blood collection and derivatives Blood was collected using a combination of venipuncture tubes to collect venous blood and contact-activated lancets to collect capillary blood from the fingertip. Each crew member provided blood samples, collected into one BD PAXgene blood RNA tube (bRNA), four BD Vacutainer K2 EDTA tubes, two BD Vacutainer cell preparation tubes (CPTs), one Streck cell-free DNA tube (cfDNA BCT), one BD Vacutainer serum separator tube (SST), and one DBS card per time point. Tubes were transported from the collection site to the field laboratory at room temperature. From these tubes, whole blood, plasma, PBMCs, serum, and cell pellet samples were collected (Supplementary Table 3). Sample yields are reported below. Samples were aliquoted for long-term storage and biobanking (Supplementary Table 4). bRNA tubes were collected in order to isolate total RNA using the PAXgene blood RNA kit (Fig. 2a). Yield ranged from 3.04 to 14.04 µg/tube of total RNA across all samples, and the RNA integrity number (RIN) ranged from 3.2 to 8.5 (mean: 6.95) (Fig. 2b). RNA was stored at −80 °C after extraction. The collection of total RNA enables a variety of downstream RNA profiling methods. It will allow comparative studies to prior RNA-sequencing performed on astronauts, particularly snoRNA & lncRNA biomarkers analyzed from Space Shuttle era blood25,26, mRNA & miRNA measured during the NASA Twin Study17,18, and whole blood RNA arrays from the ISS27,28. Additionally, RNA yields are more than sufficient to perform direct-RNA sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms, which require 500 ng of total RNA per library (Manufacturer’s protocol, ONT kit SQK-RNA002). This enables the study of RNA modification changes during spaceflight to create epitranscriptomic profiles for the first time in astronauts. Fig. 2. bRNA and K2 EDTA Tubes. Open in a new tab a One 2.5 mL bRNA tube was collected per crew member at each ground timepoint. b bRNA tube total RNA yields per sample (μg) and RINs. c Four K2 EDTA tubes were collected per member at each ground timepoint. One tube was used for a CBC, one tube was used to isolate EVPs, and two tubes were used for isolation of PBMCs. d Plasma and EVP yields from the “[2] EVPS” tube on Fig. 2c. e PBMC yields per mL from the “[3] PBMCs” tubes on Fig. 2c.Four K2 EDTA tubes were drawn at each timepoint from each crew member (Fig. 2c). One K2 EDTA tube was submitted to Quest Diagnostics to perform a complete blood count (CBC, Quest Test Code: 6399). One tube was used to isolate extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) for proteomic quantification (Fig. 3a). Total EVP quantities varied from 2.71-28.27 ug (Fig. 2d). Two K2 EDTA tubes were used to isolate PBMCs for single-cell sequencing (10X Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression and Chromium Single Cell Immune Profiling workflows). After collection, a Ficoll separation was performed to isolate PBMCs, which ranged from 340,000-975,000 cells per mL of blood (Fig. 2e). One prior single-cell gene expression experiment, NASA Twin study, was performed on astronauts, which found immune cell population specific gene expression changes and a correlation with microRNA signatures11,18. Fig. 3. Tube Processing Steps. Open in a new tab Centrifuge (brown circles) and aliquoting (white and green boxes and circles) protocols for a K2 EDTA tubes designated for EVP isolation b CPTs c cfDNA BCTs ans.d d SST.Additional PBMCs, plasma, and serum were collected from CPTs (Fig. 4a), cfDNA BCTs (Fig. 4d), SSTs (Fig. 4c), as well as red blood cell pellets. CPTs were spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3b). Plasma volume per tube ranged from 3000-14,000 uL per tube (Fig. 4d). Because of technical issues in the sample processing procedure, three instances occurred where plasma retrieval from the CPT tubes was not possible. Plasma can be used to validate or refute previous studies, including cytokine panel10,29, exosomal RNA-seq25,26, extracellular vesicle microRNA30, and proteomic20,31–33 results. PBMCs were also collected, aliquoted into 6 cryovials per CPT, and stored in liquid nitrogen after slowly cooled in a Mr. Frosty to -80 °C. These can be used to follow-up on previous studies on adaptive immunity, cell function, and immune dysregulation8,34–39. The remaining red blood cell pellet mixtures from below the gel plug in each CPT Tube were stored at −20 °C. Fig. 4. CPT, cfDNA BCT, and SST Yields. Open in a new tab a A spun CPT yields plasma, PBMCs, and a red blood cell pellet. PBMC from each tube were divided into 6 cryovials and viably frozen. Plasma was aliquoted and the pellet was frozen at −20C. b A spun cfDNA BCT yields plasma and a red blood cell pellet. Plasma was purified with an additional spin (see Fig. 4a) then aliquoted. The pellet was frozen at −20C. c A spun SST yields serum and a red blood cell pellet. Serum was aliquoted and the pellet was frozen at −20C. d CPT plasma volumes per timepoint are reported. e cfDNA (Streck) BCT plasma volumes per timepoint. f SST serum volumes per timepoint. An extra tube was drawn for C004 at R + 45, resulting in a higher serum yield.cfDNA BCT (Streck) tubes were collected to isolate high-quality cfDNA from plasma. cfDNA BCTs were spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3c). The remaining cell pellet mixture was frozen at −20 °C. Plasma volume per timepoint ranged from 1500-5000 uL (Fig. 4e). 500 uL aliquots were frozen at -80 °C. cfDNA extracted from these tubes can be analyzed for fragment length, mitochondrial or nuclear origin, and cell type or tissue of origin40–42. The SST was spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3d). Serum volume ranged from 2000-8000 uL per timepoint (Fig. 4f). Similar to plasma, serum can be allocated for cytokine analysis and can also be used to perform comprehensive metabolic panels, including one we used at Quest (CMP, Quest Test Code: 10231) for metrics on alkaline phosphatase, calcium, glucose, potassium, and sodium, among other metabolic markers. The remaining cell pellet mixture from each SST tube was stored at −20 °C. In addition to venous blood, capillary blood was collected onto a DBS card using a contact-activated lancet pressed against the fingertip (Fig. 5a). Capillary blood was collected onto a Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS card to preserve nucleic acids and proteins. Each of the five spots on the DBS card hold 75-80uL of capillary blood, however, the amount of capillary blood collected across timepoints varied (Fig. 5b, c) according to how much blood could be collected before the lancet-puncture closed. Fig. 5. Dried Blood Spot (DBS) Collection Yields. Open in a new tab a DBS cards were collected preflight, during flight, and postflight. There were five spots for blood collection per card. b Blood collections varied in saturation level across blood spots and timepoints. These were classified as “full”, “partial”, and occasionally “empty”. c DBS card yields per blood spot, per timepoint, and per crew member. Saliva collection Saliva was collected at the L-92, L-44, L-3, FD1, FD2, FD3, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 timepoints using two methods. First, saliva was collected using the OMNIgene Oral Kit (OME-505), which preserves nucleic acids (Fig. 6a) during the ground timepoints. From these samples, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted. DNA yield ranged from 28.1 to 3187.8 ng, RNA yield from 396.0 to 3544.2 ng (less the two samples had concentrations too low for measurement), and protein concentration from 92.97 to 93.15 ng. Fig. 6. Saliva Collections. Open in a new tab a DNA, RNA, and protein yields from the OMNIgene Oral kits. b Volume of crude saliva collected per timepoint.Second, crude saliva (i.e., saliva with no preservative added) was collected into a 5 mL DNase/RNase-free screw top tube during the ground and flight timepoints. Saliva volume varied from 150 to 4000 uL per tube (Fig. 6b). Crude saliva was also collected during flight (FD2 and FD3), in addition to the ground timepoints. Saliva collections have been conducted throughout spaceflight studies for assessing the immune state of crews, particularly in the context of viral reactivation. Previously identified viruses that reactivate during spaceflight include Epstein–Barr, varicella-zoster, and cytomegalovirus43. Responses to reactivation of these viruses can be asymptomatic, debilitating, or even life-threatening, thus assessing these adaptations is beneficial in understanding viral spaceflight activity as well as crew health. In addition to viral nucleic acid quantification, numerous biochemical assays can also be performed, including measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and cytokines, among others10,43–46. Urine collection Urine was collected in sterile specimen cups at the L-92, L-44, L-3, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 timepoints. Specimen cups were collected 1-2 times per day. For preservation, urine was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Half the urine had Zymo Urine Conditioning Buffer (UCB) added before freezing, to preserve nucleic acids. Samples yielded 23–155.5 mL of crude urine and 21 - 112 mL of UCB urine per specimen cup (Fig. 7a). Urine was split into 1 mL - 15 mL aliquots before freezing at -80 °C. Fig. 7. Urine and Stool Sample Collections. Open in a new tab a Urine volumes per timepoint. Volumes are reported for both crude urine and urine preserved with Zymo urine conditioning buffer (UCB). b Timepoints that stool tubes were collected. “Gut” tubes are OMNIgene•GUT tubes for microbiome preservation. “Met” tubes are OMNImet•GUT tubes for metabolome preservation. c Stool “Gut” tube DNA and RNA extraction quantities.A wide variety of assays can be performed on urine samples. Previous studies have included viral reactivation43,46,47, urinary cortisol48,49, iron and magnesium measurements50–53, bone status54–56, kidney stones54,55, proteomics11, telomere measurements57, and various biomarkers and metabolites17,49,58–61. Stool collection Stool was collected at the L-92, L-44, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 timepoints. Stool samples were stored into two collection containers at each timepoint, one DNA Genotek OMNIgene Gut (OMR−200) kit with a preservative for metagenomics and another (ME−200) with a preservative for metabolomics (Fig. 7b). Stool was the least consistent sample collected due to the limited windows available for sampling during collection timeframes. DNA and RNA were extracted from aliquots of the OMNIgene Gut (OMR−200) tubes for downstream microbiome analysis. DNA yield ranged from 358.5 to 16,660 ng, RNA from 690 to 2010 ng (Fig. 7c). Large variations in yield are attributable to variable stool mass collected between kits. Stool samples enable various biochemical, immune, and microbiome changes studies. Previous metagenomic assays have found that shannon alpha diversity and richness during long-duration missions to the ISS62. Skin swabs Body swabs were collected at all timepoints. Samples were collected by swabbing the body region of interest for 30 seconds, then placing the swab in a sterile 2D matrix tube (Thermo Scientific #3710) with Zymo DNA/RNA shield preservative. For the first two swab locations, the oral and nasal cavity, the swab was placed directly on the body after removal from its sterile packaging (dry-swab method; Fig. 8a). For the remaining body locations, the swab was briefly dipped in nuclease-free, DNA/RNA-free water before proceeding (wet-swab method). Eight distinct sites were swabbed with the wet-swab method: post-auricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, and the toe-web space (Fig. 8b). The astronaut microbiome has previously been studied in the forehead, forearm, nasal, armpit, navel, postauricular, and tongue body locations, and changes have been documented during flight. Changes in alpha diversity and beta diversity were documented, as well as shifts in microbial genera62. However, the impact of these changes on skin health and immunological health are not well understood. Fig. 8. Skin Collection Locations and Sample Types. Open in a new tab a Dry swabs were collected from two body locations. b Wet swabs were collected from eight body locations. c Swabs were collected from the deltoid region. Immediately after, 3- or 4-mm skin biopsies were collected from the same area and divided for histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics.Acquiring extensive swab samples from the crew skin allows for characterization of the habitat environment, crew skin microbiome adaptations, and interactions with potential human health adaptations resulting from spaceflight exposure. This is very relevant for crew health, considering astronauts become more susceptible to infections during spaceflight missions63, with the relationship between microbe-host interactions from spaceflight exposure, which may be a causative factor of astronauts immune dysfunction, which is still not well understood. Skin Biopsies A skin biopsy on the deltoid was obtained from the L-44 and R + 1 timepoint. Biopsies were also collected in advance of a flight to ensure the biopsy site is fully healed before the flight so there is no risk of complication. The wet-swab method was used to collect the skin microbiome before the skin biopsy. The skin biopsies were 3–4 millimeters in diameter and were collected for histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) (Fig. 8c). One-third of the sample was stored in formalin and kept at room temperature to perform histology. The remaining two-thirds of the sample was stored in a cryovial and placed at -80 °C for SRT (Fig. 8c). This is the first sample collected from astronauts for spatially resolved transcriptomics. The skin is of high interest due to the inflammation-related cytokine markers such as IL-12p40, IL-10, IL-17A, and IL-1810,17 and skin rash’s status as the most frequent clinical symptom reported during spaceflight64. Environmental swabs and HEPA filter Environmental swabs were collected in flight during the F1 and F2 timepoint. Additionally, environmental swabs were collected from the flight simulation capsule at SpaceX headquarters after days of crew training during the L-92 and L-44 timepoints. Environmental swabs were collected using the wet-swab method. Ten environmental swabs were collected per time point at the following locations in the capsule: an ambient air/control swab, the execute button, the viewing dome, the side hatch mobility aid, the lid of the waste locker, the head section of one of the seats, the commode panel, the right and left sides of the control screen, and the g-meter button (Fig. 9a-d). Additionally, the spacecraft’s high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filter was acquired post-flight. This filter was cut into 127 rectangular pieces (1.2” x 1.6” x 4”) and stored at −20 °C. Fig. 9. Capsule Swab Locations. Open in a new tab a Swab locations, descriptions, and label IDs. b Interior view of the SpaceX Dragon capsule. c View of the control panel located above the middle seats in the Dragon capsule. d View of the cupola (viewing dome) region from the outside. The rim of the dome was swabbed from the inside (ID 10).Previous microbial profiling of spacecraft environments has revealed that equipment sterilized on the ground becomes coated in microbial life in space due to interactions with crew and the introduction of equipment that has not undergone sterilization65. Subsequent microbial monitoring assays performed on the ISS have detected novel, spaceflight-specific species on the ISS66. Once in space, surface microbes are subject to the unique microgravity and radiation environment of flight, which will influence evolutionary trajectory. The potential impact of this influence on pathogenesis is a concern for long-duration space missions, especially given that changes in host-pathogen interactions may also be affected during spaceflight67.",
    "discussion": "Discussion We report here on biospecimen samples collected from the SpaceX I4 Mission, the most comprehensive human biological specimen collection effort performed on an astronaut cohort to date. The extensive archive of biospecimens included venous blood, dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, microbiome body swabs, skin biopsies, and environmental capsule swabs. The study objective was to establish a foundational set of methods for biospecimen collection and banking on commercial spaceflight missions suitable for multi-omic and molecular analysis. Biospecimens were collected to enable comprehensive, multi-omic profiles, which can then be used to develop molecular catalogs with higher resolution of human responses to spaceflight. Select, targeted measures in clinical labs (CLIA) were also performed immediately after sample collection (CBC, CMP), and samples and viable cells were preserved in a long-term Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank, such that additional assays and measures can be conducted in the future. Great care was put into the standardization of sample processing between field laboratories in Hawthorne, Cape Canaveral, and Houston. Despite our best efforts to control for all preanalytical variables68, there are some inconsistencies in sample processing that were unavoidable during this mission. Of note, there was no access to cold stowage during flight, causing all samples to be stowed at room temperature until they arrived back on Earth. Of the three sample types collected during flight, two were stable at room temperature (skin/capsule swabs stored in DNA/RNA shield and capillary blood collected on dried blood spot cards). The third (saliva samples), were not stored in a preservative and, for this reason, will have a distinct profile compared to other timepoints. This limits the context in which these samples will be useful, but will still provide biological insights in more targeted biological studies. We can imagine situations in the future where there will be tradeoffs between standardization of sample collection with previous missions and mission-specific constraints influencing the selection of biospecimen collection methods. However, there are several reasons why rigorous biospecimen collection methods for commercial and private spaceflight missions must be developed, which are scalable and translational across populations, missions, and mission parameters. First, little is known about the biological and clinical responses that occur in civilians during and after space travel. While professional astronauts are generally young, healthy, and extensively trained, civilian astronauts have been, and likely will be, far more heterogeneous. They will possess a variety of phenotypes, including older ages, different health backgrounds, and greater medication use, and may experience different medical conditions, risks, and comorbidities. Careful molecular characterization will be beneficial for the development of appropriate baseline metrics and countermeasures and, therefore, beneficial for the individual spaceflight experience. In the future, such analyses may enable precision medicine applications aimed at optimizing countermeasures for each individual astronaut who enters and returns safely from space69,70. Second, multi-omic studies inherently present a large number of measurements within a small set of subjects. These high-dimensional datasets present numerous potential challenges with regard to the amplification of noise, risk of overfitting, and false discoveries71. At all times, scientists engaged in multi-omic analyses must take special care that true biological variance is what has been measured. The introduction of experimental variance through the progression from sample collection, transport, and storage, to sequencing and analysis can introduce artifacts of variance that render the detection of true biological variance and interpretation of results more difficult. For this reason, tight adherence to experimental controls or annotation at every step of the experimental condition is crucial. Careful annotation allows for the assignment of class variables in post hoc analysis. Among such applications are the attempt to detect batch effects or determine the impact of variations in temperature (collection, storage, or transport)72. The necessary means to address experimental variance are longitudinal sampling and specimen aliquoting. Longitudinal sampling (i.e. collecting numerous serial samples from each test condition) from pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight allows for greater statistical power when assessing changes attributable to spaceflight. In addition, each sample collected should be divided upon collection into multiple aliquots. This better assures that freeze-thaw cycles can be avoided in the analysis stage, as freeze-thaw events can introduce considerable experimental variance depending on the molecular class being measured. Maintaining all samples at their optimal storage temperature at all times, typically -80 °C or lower (e.g. liquid nitrogen for cells), is crucial73. Special attention must be given to how the collection and storage methods in-flight vary in relation to the conditions on Earth. Spaceflight presents considerable differences in the operating environment, where ground conditions are far easier to control than flight. In practice, this may limit the types of samples that can be collected during flight. Third, rigorous methods must be developed and followed to pursue comparisons across missions with varying design parameters. In this consideration, there is an argument for the development of specimen collection, transport, storage, processing, analysis, and reporting standards. At the same time, this must be balanced with the flexibility required for innovation since standards can sometimes limit advancement in methodology. In the present study, common methods were used for the I4 and the Polaris Dawn and Axiom-2 missions. However, selected methods may require optimization for Polaris Dawn-like missions, to increase the yields during sample processing and adapt to unique parameters imposed by the anticipated spacewalk (extravehicular activity; EVA). Moreover, within standards or best practices, unique research for each mission may require alteration of previously successful methods. With these considerations in mind, we must balance methodology standardization with advances in methodology options and mission-specific objectives. As the commercial spaceflight sector gains momentum and more astronauts with different health profiles and backgrounds have access to space, comprehensive data on the biological impact of short-duration spaceflight is of paramount importance. Such data will further expand our understanding and knowledge of how spaceflight affects human physiology, microbial adaptations, and environmental biology. The use of integrative omics technologies for civilian astronauts has revealed novel responses across genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiome, and transcriptomics measures74–83. Creating multi-omic datasets from spaceflight studies on astronaut cohorts will further advance our understanding, inform future mission planning, and help discover what appropriate countermeasures can be developed to minimize future risk and enhance performance. Validating sample collection methodologies initially in short-duration commercial spaceflight is a key step for future human health research in long-duration and exploration-class missions to the Moon and beyond. To help meet these challenges, we have established the SOMA protocols, which detail standard multi-omic measures of astronaut health and protocols for sample collection from astronaut cohorts. Although the all-civilian I4 crew pioneered the first use of the SOMA protocols, the methodology outlined here is robust and generalizable, making it applicable to future astronaut crews from any commercial mission provider (e.g., SpaceX, Axiom Space, Sierra Space, Blue Origin) or space agencies (NASA, ESA, JAXA, ROSCOSMOS). Furthermore, the SOMA banking, sequencing, and processing methods are a springboard for continuing biospecimen analysis and expanding our knowledge of multi-omic dynamics before, during, and after human spaceflight missions, providing a molecular roadmap for crew health, medical biometrics, and possible countermeasures.",

Abstract The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of spaceflight on the human body. Biospecimen samples were collected from four crew members longitudinally before (Launch: L-92, L-44, L-3 days), during (Flight Day: FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (Return: R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days) spaceflight, spanning a total of 289 days across 2021-2022. The collection process included venous whole blood, capillary dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX Dragon capsule HEPA filter, and skin biopsies. Venous whole blood was further processed to obtain aliquots of serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In total, 2,911 sample aliquots were shipped to our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays and biobanking. This paper provides an overview of the extensive biospecimen collection and highlights their processing procedures and long-term biobanking techniques, facilitating future molecular tests and evaluations.As such, this study details a robust framework for obtaining and preserving high-quality human, microbial, and environmental samples for aerospace medicine in the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) initiative, which can aid future human spaceflight and space biology experiments. Subject terms: Molecular biology, Genetics, Biomarkers Here the authors provide the biospecimen collection methodology from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission, including venous blood, capillary blood, saliva, urine, stool, skin biopsy, body swab, and environmental swab samples.Introduction Our human space exploration efforts are at a unique transition point in history, with more crewed launches and human presence in space than ever before1. We can attribute this to the commercial spaceflight sector entering an industrial renaissance, with multiple companies forming collaborative and competitive networks to send commercial astronauts into space. The recent advancements in human space exploration offer a significant chance to gather more biological research samples and enhance our comprehension of spaceflight’s effects on human health. This is vital, as our knowledge of the biological reactions to the unique environment of space, marked by microgravity and the space radiation, remains incomplete2. The impact of spaceflight on human health includes musculoskeletal deconditioning3, cardiovascular adaptations4, vision changes5, space motion sickness6, neurovestibular changes7, immune dysfunction8, and increased risk of rare cancers9, among other changes2. However, we are still at the initial stages of documenting biological responses to spaceflight exposure at the molecular and cellular resolution. Prior work has characterized molecular changes that occur during spaceflight in astronauts. These include changes in cytokine profiles8,10,11, urinary albumin abundance12, and hemolysis13. Furthermore, multiomic assays have provided genomic maps of structural changes in DNA14–16, RNA expression profiles11,17,18, sample-wide protein measurements17,19,20, and metabolomic status17. Additionally, International Space Station (ISS) surfaces have been studied with longitudinal microbial profiles to track microbial pathogenicity and evolution to assess their potential influence on crew health21,22. To better improve our understanding of both human and microbial biology in space, it is critical that these analyses continue and expand as more spacecraft and stations are built and flown. Combining and comparing work from prior missions in these new spacecraft and stations is especially important to overcome the small sample sizes and highlights a need for standardization between missions. In addition, recruiting large cohorts of astronauts is difficult, as the ISS typically can only house up to six astronauts at a time. As of the time of writing, only 647 humans have been to space, starting with the launch of Yuri Gagarin in 1961. Studies have spanned the Vostok program, Project Mercury, the Voskhod program, Project Gemini, Project Apollo, the Soyuz program, the Salyut space stations, MIR, the Space Shuttle Program, SkyLab, Tiangong Space Station, and the ISS. From the breadth of experiments that have been performed on the ISS, only a minority have specifically been human research-oriented23,24, and just a subset involve omics studies. The NASA Twin Study created the most in-depth multi-omic study of astronauts prior to Inspiration4, but was limited to one astronaut and one ground control17. These factors have limited the statistical power of astronaut omic experiments and increased the difficulty of providing robust scientific conclusions. Standardizing biospecimen collections across multiple missions will create larger sample sets needed to draw these conclusions. Here, we establish the standard biospecimen sample collection and banking procedures for the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA). A key goal of SOMA is to standardize biospecimen collection and processing for spaceflight, to generate high-quality multi-omics data across spaceflight investigations, and to enable follow-up experiments with viably frozen cells and biobanked samples. This paper provides sample collection methods built for standardized field collections across different crews and missions. We cover the decentralized sample collection process from the Inspiration4 (I4) mission from the point of collection to the preservation of samples for downstream biochemical and omics processing at our centralized lab at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM). These protocols can produce synchronized datasets with enhanced statistical strength, amplifying our scientific findings from spaceflight studies. Additionally, we showcase metrics related to sample collection outputs, references of past astronaut sample collections in scientific publications, and suggestions to refine sample collection for upcoming missions. In its inaugural use case, these samples were collected from the I4 astronaut cohort and are currently in use for several other missions (Polaris Dawn, Axiom-2), which will enable continued utilization for future crewed space missions.Results Biospecimen collection overview We formulated and executed a sampling plan that spans a wide range of biospecimen samples: venous blood, capillary dried blood spots (DBSs), saliva, urine, stool, skin swabs, skin biopsies, and environmental swabs (Fig. 1a). The collection of various types of samples covered the scope of previous assays on astronaut samples (Supplementary Table 1), but also enabled newer omics technologies, such as spatially resolved, single-molecule, and single-cell assays. Fig. 1. Biospecimen Samples and Collection Locations. Open in a new tab a List of biospecimen samples collected over the course of the study. b Timepoints for each biospecimen sample collection. “L-” denotes the number of days prior to launch. “R + ” denotes the number of days after return to Earth. “FD” denotes which day of the flight a sample was collected. c Location of each collection timepoint.For the I4 mission, sample collection spanned three-time points pre-launch (L-92, L-44, L-3 days), three-time points during flight (Flight Day 1 (FD1), FD2, FD3), and four-time points post-return (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days). Venous blood, urine, stool, and skin biopsies were collected during ground timepoints only, while capillary DBSs, saliva, and skin swabs were collected both on the ground and during flight (Fig. 1b). Environmental swabs of the Dragon capsule were collected pre-flight in the crew training capsule and during flight in the spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral (Fig. 1b). Samples were collected across a variety of locations based on the crew’s training and travel schedule. L-92 and L-44 were collected in Hawthorne, CA at SpaceX Headquarters, L-3 and R + 1 were collected at Cape Canaveral, FL at a facility near the launch site. FD1, FD2, and FD3 were collected inside the Dragon capsule while in orbit. R + 45 was collected at the crew members’ individual locations (which spanned the US States NY, NJ, TN, and WA), R + 82 was collected at Weill Cornell Medicine, NY and R + 194 was collected at Baylor College of Medicine, TX (Fig. 1c). All samples from ground timepoints were processed within 16 hours of collection. All samples from the flight were processed immediately after retrieval from the flight. Samples were stored at −80 °C at each site immediately after processing and aliquoting (processing steps are outlined below). All samples were shipped via FedEx using Overnight Shipping to Weill Cornell Medicine for storage in the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank (CAMbank) within 1 week of collection on dry ice in styrofoam boxes and spent <2 days in transit. No samples were shipped on a Thursday or Friday to avoid weekend shipping delays. All samples arrived at Weill Cornell Medicine with dry-ice still in the packaging and samples frozen. Samples were immediately transferred to −80 °C for long-term storage and biobanking. Any exceptions to this process will be noted below. In total, we collected 2,911 sample aliquots, which were then processed in our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays (Supplementary Table 2). Some samples were processed immediately at field laboratory facilities (Supplementary Data Fig. 1). DNA and RNA yields are also reported below from collection kits (saliva and stool) after arrival at WCM.Blood collection and derivatives Blood was collected using a combination of venipuncture tubes to collect venous blood and contact-activated lancets to collect capillary blood from the fingertip. Each crew member provided blood samples, collected into one BD PAXgene blood RNA tube (bRNA), four BD Vacutainer K2 EDTA tubes, two BD Vacutainer cell preparation tubes (CPTs), one Streck cell-free DNA tube (cfDNA BCT), one BD Vacutainer serum separator tube (SST), and one DBS card per time point. Tubes were transported from the collection site to the field laboratory at room temperature. From these tubes, whole blood, plasma, PBMCs, serum, and cell pellet samples were collected (Supplementary Table 3). Sample yields are reported below. Samples were aliquoted for long-term storage and biobanking (Supplementary Table 4). bRNA tubes were collected in order to isolate total RNA using the PAXgene blood RNA kit (Fig. 2a). Yield ranged from 3.04 to 14.04 µg/tube of total RNA across all samples, and the RNA integrity number (RIN) ranged from 3.2 to 8.5 (mean: 6.95) (Fig. 2b). RNA was stored at −80 °C after extraction. The collection of total RNA enables a variety of downstream RNA profiling methods. It will allow comparative studies to prior RNA-sequencing performed on astronauts, particularly snoRNA & lncRNA biomarkers analyzed from Space Shuttle era blood25,26, mRNA & miRNA measured during the NASA Twin Study17,18, and whole blood RNA arrays from the ISS27,28. Additionally, RNA yields are more than sufficient to perform direct-RNA sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms, which require 500 ng of total RNA per library (Manufacturer’s protocol, ONT kit SQK-RNA002). This enables the study of RNA modification changes during spaceflight to create epitranscriptomic profiles for the first time in astronauts. Fig. 2. bRNA and K2 EDTA Tubes.

One K2 EDTA tube was submitted to Quest Diagnostics to perform a complete blood count (CBC, Quest Test Code: 6399). One tube was used to isolate extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) for proteomic quantification (Fig. 3a). Total EVP quantities varied from 2.71-28.27 ug (Fig. 2d). Two K2 EDTA tubes were used to isolate PBMCs for single-cell sequencing (10X Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression and Chromium Single Cell Immune Profiling workflows). After collection, a Ficoll separation was performed to isolate PBMCs, which ranged from 340,000-975,000 cells per mL of blood (Fig. 2e). One prior single-cell gene expression experiment, NASA Twin study, was performed on astronauts, which found immune cell population specific gene expression changes and a correlation with microRNA signatures11,18.

Open in a new tab Centrifuge (brown circles) and aliquoting (white and green boxes and circles) protocols for a K2 EDTA tubes designated for EVP isolation b CPTs c cfDNA BCTs ans.d d SST.Additional PBMCs, plasma, and serum were collected from CPTs (Fig. 4a), cfDNA BCTs (Fig. 4d), SSTs (Fig. 4c), as well as red blood cell pellets. CPTs were spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3b). Plasma volume per tube ranged from 3000-14,000 uL per tube (Fig. 4d). Because of technical issues in the sample processing procedure, three instances occurred where plasma retrieval from the CPT tubes was not possible. Plasma can be used to validate or refute previous studies, including cytokine panel10,29, exosomal RNA-seq25,26, extracellular vesicle microRNA30, and proteomic20,31–33 results. PBMCs were also collected, aliquoted into 6 cryovials per CPT, and stored in liquid nitrogen after slowly cooled in a Mr. Frosty to -80 °C. These can be used to follow-up on previous studies on adaptive immunity, cell function, and immune dysregulation8,34–39. The remaining red blood cell pellet mixtures from below the gel plug in each CPT Tube were stored at −20 °C. Fig. 4. CPT, cfDNA BCT, and SST Yields. Open in a new tab a A spun CPT yields plasma, PBMCs, and a red blood cell pellet. PBMC from each tube were divided into 6 cryovials and viably frozen. Plasma was aliquoted and the pellet was frozen at −20C. b A spun cfDNA BCT yields plasma and a red blood cell pellet. Plasma was purified with an additional spin (see Fig. 4a) then aliquoted. The pellet was frozen at −20C. c A spun SST yields serum and a red blood cell pellet. Serum was aliquoted and the pellet was frozen at −20C. d CPT plasma volumes per timepoint are reported. e cfDNA (Streck) BCT plasma volumes per timepoint. f SST serum volumes per timepoint. An extra tube was drawn for C004 at R + 45, resulting in a higher serum yield.cfDNA BCT (Streck) tubes were collected to isolate high-quality cfDNA from plasma. cfDNA BCTs were spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3c). The remaining cell pellet mixture was frozen at −20 °C. Plasma volume per timepoint ranged from 1500-5000 uL (Fig. 4e). 500 uL aliquots were frozen at -80 °C. cfDNA extracted from these tubes can be analyzed for fragment length, mitochondrial or nuclear origin, and cell type or tissue of origin40–42. The SST was spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3d). Serum volume ranged from 2000-8000 uL per timepoint (Fig. 4f). Similar to plasma, serum can be allocated for cytokine analysis and can also be used to perform comprehensive metabolic panels, including one we used at Quest (CMP, Quest Test Code: 10231) for metrics on alkaline phosphatase, calcium, glucose, potassium, and sodium, among other metabolic markers. The remaining cell pellet mixture from each SST tube was stored at −20 °C. In addition to venous blood, capillary blood was collected onto a DBS card using a contact-activated lancet pressed against the fingertip (Fig. 5a). Capillary blood was collected onto a Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS card to preserve nucleic acids and proteins. Each of the five spots on the DBS card hold 75-80uL of capillary blood, however, the amount of capillary blood collected across timepoints varied (Fig. 5b, c) according to how much blood could be collected before the lancet-puncture closed. Fig. 5. Dried Blood Spot (DBS) Collection Yields. Open in a new tab a DBS cards were collected preflight, during flight, and postflight. There were five spots for blood collection per card. b Blood collections varied in saturation level across blood spots and timepoints. These were classified as “full”, “partial”, and occasionally “empty”. c DBS card yields per blood spot, per timepoint, and per crew member.Saliva collection Saliva was collected at the L-92, L-44, L-3, FD1, FD2, FD3, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 timepoints using two methods. First, saliva was collected using the OMNIgene Oral Kit (OME-505), which preserves nucleic acids (Fig. 6a) during the ground timepoints. From these samples, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted. DNA yield ranged from 28.1 to 3187.8 ng, RNA yield from 396.0 to 3544.2 ng (less the two samples had concentrations too low for measurement), and protein concentration from 92.97 to 93.15 ng. Fig. 6. Saliva Collections. Open in a new tab a DNA, RNA, and protein yields from the OMNIgene Oral kits. b Volume of crude saliva collected per timepoint.Second, crude saliva (i.e., saliva with no preservative added) was collected into a 5 mL DNase/RNase-free screw top tube during the ground and flight timepoints. Saliva volume varied from 150 to 4000 uL per tube (Fig. 6b). Crude saliva was also collected during flight (FD2 and FD3), in addition to the ground timepoints. Saliva collections have been conducted throughout spaceflight studies for assessing the immune state of crews, particularly in the context of viral reactivation. Previously identified viruses that reactivate during spaceflight include Epstein–Barr, varicella-zoster, and cytomegalovirus43. Responses to reactivation of these viruses can be asymptomatic, debilitating, or even life-threatening, thus assessing these adaptations is beneficial in understanding viral spaceflight activity as well as crew health. In addition to viral nucleic acid quantification, numerous biochemical assays can also be performed, including measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and cytokines, among others10,43–46.Urine collection Urine was collected in sterile specimen cups at the L-92, L-44, L-3, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 timepoints. Specimen cups were collected 1-2 times per day. For preservation, urine was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Half the urine had Zymo Urine Conditioning Buffer (UCB) added before freezing, to preserve nucleic acids. Samples yielded 23–155.5 mL of crude urine and 21 - 112 mL of UCB urine per specimen cup (Fig. 7a). Urine was split into 1 mL - 15 mL aliquots before freezing at -80 °C. Fig. 7. Urine and Stool Sample Collections. Open in a new tab a Urine volumes per timepoint. Volumes are reported for both crude urine and urine preserved with Zymo urine conditioning buffer (UCB). b Timepoints that stool tubes were collected. “Gut” tubes are OMNIgene•GUT tubes for microbiome preservation. “Met” tubes are OMNImet•GUT tubes for metabolome preservation. c Stool “Gut” tube DNA and RNA extraction quantities.A wide variety of assays can be performed on urine samples. Previous studies have included viral reactivation43,46,47, urinary cortisol48,49, iron and magnesium measurements50–53, bone status54–56, kidney stones54,55, proteomics11, telomere measurements57, and various biomarkers and metabolites17,49,58–61.Stool collection Stool was collected at the L-92, L-44, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 timepoints. Stool samples were stored into two collection containers at each timepoint, one DNA Genotek OMNIgene Gut (OMR−200) kit with a preservative for metagenomics and another (ME−200) with a preservative for metabolomics (Fig. 7b). Stool was the least consistent sample collected due to the limited windows available for sampling during collection timeframes. DNA and RNA were extracted from aliquots of the OMNIgene Gut (OMR−200) tubes for downstream microbiome analysis. DNA yield ranged from 358.5 to 16,660 ng, RNA from 690 to 2010 ng (Fig. 7c). Large variations in yield are attributable to variable stool mass collected between kits. Stool samples enable various biochemical, immune, and microbiome changes studies. Previous metagenomic assays have found that shannon alpha diversity and richness during long-duration missions to the ISS62.Skin swabs Body swabs were collected at all timepoints. Samples were collected by swabbing the body region of interest for 30 seconds, then placing the swab in a sterile 2D matrix tube (Thermo Scientific #3710) with Zymo DNA/RNA shield preservative. For the first two swab locations, the oral and nasal cavity, the swab was placed directly on the body after removal from its sterile packaging (dry-swab method; Fig. 8a). For the remaining body locations, the swab was briefly dipped in nuclease-free, DNA/RNA-free water before proceeding (wet-swab method). Eight distinct sites were swabbed with the wet-swab method: post-auricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, and the toe-web space (Fig. 8b). The astronaut microbiome has previously been studied in the forehead, forearm, nasal, armpit, navel, postauricular, and tongue body locations, and changes have been documented during flight. Changes in alpha diversity and beta diversity were documented, as well as shifts in microbial genera62. However, the impact of these changes on skin health and immunological health are not well understood. Fig. 8. Skin Collection Locations and Sample Types. Open in a new tab a Dry swabs were collected from two body locations. b Wet swabs were collected from eight body locations. c Swabs were collected from the deltoid region. Immediately after, 3- or 4-mm skin biopsies were collected from the same area and divided for histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics.Acquiring extensive swab samples from the crew skin allows for characterization of the habitat environment, crew skin microbiome adaptations, and interactions with potential human health adaptations resulting from spaceflight exposure. This is very relevant for crew health, considering astronauts become more susceptible to infections during spaceflight missions63, with the relationship between microbe-host interactions from spaceflight exposure, which may be a causative factor of astronauts immune dysfunction, which is still not well understood.Skin Biopsies A skin biopsy on the deltoid was obtained from the L-44 and R + 1 timepoint. Biopsies were also collected in advance of a flight to ensure the biopsy site is fully healed before the flight so there is no risk of complication. The wet-swab method was used to collect the skin microbiome before the skin biopsy. The skin biopsies were 3–4 millimeters in diameter and were collected for histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) (Fig. 8c). One-third of the sample was stored in formalin and kept at room temperature to perform histology. The remaining two-thirds of the sample was stored in a cryovial and placed at -80 °C for SRT (Fig. 8c). This is the first sample collected from astronauts for spatially resolved transcriptomics. The skin is of high interest due to the inflammation-related cytokine markers such as IL-12p40, IL-10, IL-17A, and IL-1810,17 and skin rash’s status as the most frequent clinical symptom reported during spaceflight64.Environmental swabs and HEPA filter Environmental swabs were collected in flight during the F1 and F2 timepoint. Additionally, environmental swabs were collected from the flight simulation capsule at SpaceX headquarters after days of crew training during the L-92 and L-44 timepoints. Environmental swabs were collected using the wet-swab method. Ten environmental swabs were collected per time point at the following locations in the capsule: an ambient air/control swab, the execute button, the viewing dome, the side hatch mobility aid, the lid of the waste locker, the head section of one of the seats, the commode panel, the right and left sides of the control screen, and the g-meter button (Fig. 9a-d). Additionally, the spacecraft’s high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filter was acquired post-flight. This filter was cut into 127 rectangular pieces (1.2” x 1.6” x 4”) and stored at −20 °C. Fig. 9. Capsule Swab Locations. Open in a new tab a Swab locations, descriptions, and label IDs. b Interior view of the SpaceX Dragon capsule. c View of the control panel located above the middle seats in the Dragon capsule. d View of the cupola (viewing dome) region from the outside. The rim of the dome was swabbed from the inside (ID 10).Previous microbial profiling of spacecraft environments has revealed that equipment sterilized on the ground becomes coated in microbial life in space due to interactions with crew and the introduction of equipment that has not undergone sterilization65. Subsequent microbial monitoring assays performed on the ISS have detected novel, spaceflight-specific species on the ISS66. Once in space, surface microbes are subject to the unique microgravity and radiation environment of flight, which will influence evolutionary trajectory. The potential impact of this influence on pathogenesis is a concern for long-duration space missions, especially given that changes in host-pathogen interactions may also be affected during spaceflight67.Discussion We report here on biospecimen samples collected from the SpaceX I4 Mission, the most comprehensive human biological specimen collection effort performed on an astronaut cohort to date. The extensive archive of biospecimens included venous blood, dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, microbiome body swabs, skin biopsies, and environmental capsule swabs. The study objective was to establish a foundational set of methods for biospecimen collection and banking on commercial spaceflight missions suitable for multi-omic and molecular analysis. Biospecimens were collected to enable comprehensive, multi-omic profiles, which can then be used to develop molecular catalogs with higher resolution of human responses to spaceflight. Select, targeted measures in clinical labs (CLIA) were also performed immediately after sample collection (CBC, CMP), and samples and viable cells were preserved in a long-term Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank, such that additional assays and measures can be conducted in the future. Great care was put into the standardization of sample processing between field laboratories in Hawthorne, Cape Canaveral, and Houston. Despite our best efforts to control for all preanalytical variables68, there are some inconsistencies in sample processing that were unavoidable during this mission. Of note, there was no access to cold stowage during flight, causing all samples to be stowed at room temperature until they arrived back on Earth. Of the three sample types collected during flight, two were stable at room temperature (skin/capsule swabs stored in DNA/RNA shield and capillary blood collected on dried blood spot cards). The third (saliva samples), were not stored in a preservative and, for this reason, will have a distinct profile compared to other timepoints. This limits the context in which these samples will be useful, but will still provide biological insights in more targeted biological studies. We can imagine situations in the future where there will be tradeoffs between standardization of sample collection with previous missions and mission-specific constraints influencing the selection of biospecimen collection methods. However, there are several reasons why rigorous biospecimen collection methods for commercial and private spaceflight missions must be developed, which are scalable and translational across populations, missions, and mission parameters. First, little is known about the biological and clinical responses that occur in civilians during and after space travel. While professional astronauts are generally young, healthy, and extensively trained, civilian astronauts have been, and likely will be, far more heterogeneous. They will possess a variety of phenotypes, including older ages, different health backgrounds, and greater medication use, and may experience different medical conditions, risks, and comorbidities. Careful molecular characterization will be beneficial for the development of appropriate baseline metrics and countermeasures and, therefore, beneficial for the individual spaceflight experience. In the future, such analyses may enable precision medicine applications aimed at optimizing countermeasures for each individual astronaut who enters and returns safely from space69,70. Second, multi-omic studies inherently present a large number of measurements within a small set of subjects. These high-dimensional datasets present numerous potential challenges with regard to the amplification of noise, risk of overfitting, and false discoveries71. At all times, scientists engaged in multi-omic analyses must take special care that true biological variance is what has been measured. The introduction of experimental variance through the progression from sample collection, transport, and storage, to sequencing and analysis can introduce artifacts of variance that render the detection of true biological variance and interpretation of results more difficult. For this reason, tight adherence to experimental controls or annotation at every step of the experimental condition is crucial. Careful annotation allows for the assignment of class variables in post hoc analysis. Among such applications are the attempt to detect batch effects or determine the impact of variations in temperature (collection, storage, or transport)72. The necessary means to address experimental variance are longitudinal sampling and specimen aliquoting. Longitudinal sampling (i.e. collecting numerous serial samples from each test condition) from pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight allows for greater statistical power when assessing changes attributable to spaceflight. In addition, each sample collected should be divided upon collection into multiple aliquots. This better assures that freeze-thaw cycles can be avoided in the analysis stage, as freeze-thaw events can introduce considerable experimental variance depending on the molecular class being measured. Maintaining all samples at their optimal storage temperature at all times, typically -80 °C or lower (e.g. liquid nitrogen for cells), is crucial73. Special attention must be given to how the collection and storage methods in-flight vary in relation to the conditions on Earth. Spaceflight presents considerable differences in the operating environment, where ground conditions are far easier to control than flight. In practice, this may limit the types of samples that can be collected during flight. Third, rigorous methods must be developed and followed to pursue comparisons across missions with varying design parameters. In this consideration, there is an argument for the development of specimen collection, transport, storage, processing, analysis, and reporting standards. At the same time, this must be balanced with the flexibility required for innovation since standards can sometimes limit advancement in methodology. In the present study, common methods were used for the I4 and the Polaris Dawn and Axiom-2 missions. However, selected methods may require optimization for Polaris Dawn-like missions, to increase the yields during sample processing and adapt to unique parameters imposed by the anticipated spacewalk (extravehicular activity; EVA). Moreover, within standards or best practices, unique research for each mission may require alteration of previously successful methods. With these considerations in mind, we must balance methodology standardization with advances in methodology options and mission-specific objectives. As the commercial spaceflight sector gains momentum and more astronauts with different health profiles and backgrounds have access to space, comprehensive data on the biological impact of short-duration spaceflight is of paramount importance. Such data will further expand our understanding and knowledge of how spaceflight affects human physiology, microbial adaptations, and environmental biology. The use of integrative omics technologies for civilian astronauts has revealed novel responses across genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiome, and transcriptomics measures74–83. Creating multi-omic datasets from spaceflight studies on astronaut cohorts will further advance our understanding, inform future mission planning, and help discover what appropriate countermeasures can be developed to minimize future risk and enhance performance. Validating sample collection methodologies initially in short-duration commercial spaceflight is a key step for future human health research in long-duration and exploration-class missions to the Moon and beyond. To help meet these challenges, we have established the SOMA protocols, which detail standard multi-omic measures of astronaut health and protocols for sample collection from astronaut cohorts. Although the all-civilian I4 crew pioneered the first use of the SOMA protocols, the methodology outlined here is robust and generalizable, making it applicable to future astronaut crews from any commercial mission provider (e.g., SpaceX, Axiom Space, Sierra Space, Blue Origin) or space agencies (NASA, ESA, JAXA, ROSCOSMOS). Furthermore, the SOMA banking, sequencing, and processing methods are a springboard for continuing biospecimen analysis and expanding our knowledge of multi-omic dynamics before, during, and after human spaceflight missions, providing a molecular roadmap for crew health, medical biometrics, and possible countermeasures.Methods Venous blood draw Venipuncture was performed on each subject using a BD Vacutainer® Safety-Lok™ blood collection set (BD Biosciences, #367281) and a Vacutainer one-use holder (BD Biosciences, 364815). The puncture site was located near the cubital fossa and was sterilized with a BZK antiseptic towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Blood was collected into 1 serum separator tube (SST, BD Biosciences: #367987, Lot: #1158449, #1034773), 2 cell processing tubes (CPT, BD Biosciences: #362753, Lot: #1133477, #1012161), 1 blood RNA tube (bRNA, PAXgene: #762165, Lot: #1021333), 1 cell-free DNA BCT (cfDNA BCT, Streck: #230470, Lot: #11530331), and 4 K2 EDTA blood collection tubes (BD Biosciences, #367844, Lot: #0345756) per crew member per time point. For samples collected in Hawthorne, blood was drawn at SpaceX headquarters, then immediately transported to USC for processing. Samples collected at Cape Canaveral were processed on-site.Blood tube processing For processing, serum separator tubes (SST) were centrifuged at 1300x g for 10 minutes. 500uL aliquots of serum were aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes (ThermoFisher, 3741-WP1D-BR) and stored at -80 °C. SST tubes were recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. Cell processing tubes were centrifuged at 1800xg for 30 minutes. Plasma was aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at -80 °C. 5 mL of 2% FBS (ThermoFisher, #26140079) in PBS (ThermoFisher, #10010023) was added to the CPT tube to resuspend PBMCs. PBMC suspension was transferred to a clean 15 mL conical tube. The total volume was brought to 15 mL with 2% FBS in PBS. The tube was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 300x g. Supernatant was discarded. PBMCs were resuspended 6 mL of 10% DMSO (Millipore Sigma, #D4540-500mL) in FBS. 1 mL of PBMCs were moved to 6 cryogenic vials (Corning, #8672). Cryovials were placed in a Mr. FrostyTM (ThermoFisher, #5100-0001) and stored at -80 °C. CPTs were recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. There was one outlier to this sample collection, the R + 194 timepoint, where CPT sodium citrate tubes were used (BD Biosciences, Cat no. 362760). cfDNA BCTs were centrifuged at 300xg for 20 minutes. Plasma was transferred to a 15 mL conical tube. Plasma was centrifuged 5000xg for 10 minutes. 500uL aliquots of plasma were aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at -80 °C. cfDNA BCTs were recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. PAXgene blood RNA tubes were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, tubes were left upright for a minimum of 2 hours before freezing at −20 °C. For RNA extraction, tubes were thawed and processed with the PAXgene blood RNA kit (Qiagen, #762164).Extracellular Vesicles and Particles (EVPs) Isolation One 4 mL K2 EDTA tube was shipped on ice overnight to WCM for processing. Blood was centrifuged at 500x g for 10 minutes, then plasma was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C for EVP isolation. Plasma volumes ranged between 0.6 - 1.7 ml. Plasma was later thawed for downstream processing, when concentrations were measured. Plasma samples were thawed on ice, and EVPs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (Hoshino et al., 2020). Samples were centrifuged at 12,000x g for 20 minutes to remove microvesicles, then EVPs were collected by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Coulter Optima XE or XPE ultracentrifuge at 100,000x g for 70 minutes. EVPs were then washed in PBS and pelleted again by ultracentrifugation at 100,000x g for 70 minutes. The final EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS.Dried blood spot (DBS) Crew members warmed their hands and massaged their finger towards the fingertip to enrich blood flow toward the puncture site. The puncture site was sterilized using a BZK antiseptic towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Skin was punctured using a contact-activated lancet (BD Biosciences, #366593) or a 21-gauge needle (BD Biosciences, #305167), depending on crew member preference. Capillary blood was collected onto the Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS cards (Cytiva, #10534612). Blood was transferred by touching only the blood droplet to the surface of the DBS card. DBS cards were stored at room temperature with a desiccant pack (Cytiva, #10548239).Saliva To collect crude saliva, crew members uncapped and spit into a sterile, PCR-clean, 5 mL screw-cap tube (Eppendorf, 30122330). Crew spit repeatedly until at least 1 mL was collected. Saliva was transported to a sterile flow hood and separated into 500uL aliquots. Aliquots were frozen at -80 °C. To collect preserved saliva, crew members used the OMNIgene ORAL kit (OME-505). Crew members spit into the kit’s tube until they reached the fill line. The tube was re-capped, which released the preservative liquid. Tubes were inverted to mix the saliva and preservative before being placed at −20 °C for storage. After all timepoints were collected, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein kit (Qiagen, #47054). Sample concentrations were measured with Qubit high sensitivity dsDNA and RNA platform. Proteins were quantified with the Pierce™ Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, #A53225) on Promega GloMax Plate Reader.Urine Crew members urinated into sterile specimen containers (Thermo Scientific, #13-711-56). The container was stored at 4 C until it was prepared for long-term storage. To prepare urine samples for long-term storage, urine was aliquoted into 1 mL, 15 mL, and 50 mL tubes. Half of the urine was immediately placed at −80 °C. The other half had urine conditioning buffer (Zymo, #D3061-1-140) added to the sample before placing in the -80 °C freezer.Stool collection Crew members isolated a stool sample using a paper toilet accessory (DNA Genotek, OM-AC1). Stool was transferred into and OMNIgene•GUT tube (DNAgenotek, OMR−200) and an OMNImet•GUT tube (DNA Genotek, ME−200). Tubes were placed at -80 °C for long-term storage. For nucleic acid extraction, 200uL of each tube was allocated for DNA extraction with the QIAGEN PowerFecal Pro kit and 200uL was allocated to RNA extraction with the QIAGEN PowerViral kit. The remaining sample was split into 500uL aliquots and re-stored at -80 °C.Swab collection Crew members put on gloves and remove a sterile DNA/RNA swab (Isohelix, SK-4S) from its packaging. For collection of the postauricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, toe web space, and capsule environment regions, swabs were dipped in nuclease-free water (this step was skipped for oral and nasal swabs) for ground collections. For in-flight collections, HFactor hydrogen infused water was used in place of nuclease-free water. Each body location was swabbed for 30 seconds, using both sides of the swab. Swabs were then placed in 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes containing 400uL of DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo). The tip of the swab was broken off so that only the swab tip was stored in the Matrix 2D Screw Tube. Tubes were stored at 4 C.Skin biopsies Skin biopsies were performed on the deltoid region of the arm. Each site was prepared by application of ChloraPrep and anesthesia was induced with administration of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. A trephine punch was used to remove a 3- or 4-mm diameter piece of skin. The resected piece was cut into approximately 1/3 and 2/3 sections. The smaller piece was added to a formalin-filled specimen jar. The larger piece was placed in a cryovial and stored at -80 °C. Surgical defects were closed with 1 or 2 5-0 or 4-0 nylon sutures.HEPA filter HEPA Filter was taken apart and sectioned under a chemical hood to avoid contamination. The filter contained two parts, an activated carbon component and a HEPA filter. The activated carbon component was discarded and the filter was sectioned using a sterile blade. Sections were placed in individual specimen containers and stored at −20 °C.Human subjects research All subjects were consented and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the IRB at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569.Manuscript preparation Figures 1c, 2c, 3, 5a, 8 were created with BioRender.com released under a ‘Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International license’.

    "abstract": "Abstract The discovery of new drugs is often propelled by the increasing resistance of parasites to existing drugs and the availability of better technology platforms. The area of microfluidics has provided devices for faster screening of compounds, controlled sampling/sorting of whole animals, and automated behavioral pattern recognition. In most microfluidic devices, drug effects on small animals (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans) are quantified by an end-point, dose response curve representing a single parameter (such as worm velocity or stroke frequency). Here, we present a multi-parameter extraction method to characterize modes of paralysis in C. elegans over an extended time period. A microfluidic device with real-time imaging is used to expose C. elegans to four anthelmintic drugs (i.e., pyrantel, levamisole, tribendimidine, and methyridine). We quantified worm behavior with parameters such as curls per second, types of paralyzation, mode frequency, and number/duration of active/immobilization periods. Each drug was chosen at EC75 where 75% of the worm population is responsive to the drug. At equipotent concentrations, we observed differences in the manner with which worms paralyzed in drug environments. Our study highlights the need for assaying drug effects on small animal models with multiple parameters quantified at regular time points over an extended period to adequately capture the resistance and adaptability in chemical environments.",

Copyright © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC  Copyright notice ID: 3838407 PMID: 24396537 Abstract The discovery of new drugs is often propelled by the increasing resistance of parasites to existing drugs and the availability of better technology platforms. The area of microfluidics has provided devices for faster screening of compounds, controlled sampling/sorting of whole animals, and automated behavioral pattern recognition. In most microfluidic devices, drug effects on small animals (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans) are quantified by an end-point, dose response curve representing a single parameter (such as worm velocity or stroke frequency). Here, we present a multi-parameter extraction method to characterize modes of paralysis in C. elegans over an extended time period. A microfluidic device with real-time imaging is used to expose C. elegans to four anthelmintic drugs (i.e., pyrantel, levamisole, tribendimidine, and methyridine). We quantified worm behavior with parameters such as curls per second, types of paralyzation, mode frequency, and number/duration of active/immobilization periods. Each drug was chosen at EC75 where 75% of the worm population is responsive to the drug. At equipotent concentrations, we observed differences in the manner with which worms paralyzed in drug environments. Our study highlights the need for assaying drug effects on small animal models with multiple parameters quantified at regular time points over an extended period to adequately capture the resistance and adaptability in chemical environments.INTRODUCTION Parasitic nematodes have adopted a range of infection, survival, and propagation strategies within hosts of interest, including humans, domestic animals (e.g., cows, pigs, sheep, horses), and agricultural plants (e.g., soybean, corn, rice, potato).1, 2, 3, 4, 5 In particular, intestinal nematodes affect over one-third of the human population and have a negative socioeconomic impact on our society.6, 7 Studies have shown that neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) arising from intestinal nematodes can affect human growth, nutrition, cognition, productivity, intelligence, and earnings. These effects are more pronounced in the poorest countries of the world where a population is strangled in poverty, low performance, and prolonged diseased state.4, 6 Classes of compounds called anthelmintics have been developed and studied for the treatment of intestinal nematodes.4, 8, 9 In the absence of available vaccines, anthelmintic chemotherapy is the only choice for the control of intestinal infection in humans and livestock. Two of these classes of drugs have been approved for use by the World Health Organization: benzimidazoles and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists. The common benzimidazoles are mebendazole and albendazole.10 The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists are grouped under two receptors subtypes they target: L-type and N-type.8 While levamisole and pyrantel are examples of L-type nAChR agonists, methyridine is an example of N-type nAChR agonist.7, 9, 11 Tribendimidine is relatively understudied and its mechanism of action is shown to be similar to levamisole and pyrantel.6, 12 With slow progress in the discovery of new anthelmintics, parasitic worms have developed varying levels of resistance to these compounds.4 In fact, multidrug resistance in parasitic worms is now recognized as a prevalent global menace that overwhelms basic research in chemotherapeutic agents.4, 12, 13, 14 Platforms to investigate the efficacy and resistance of anthelmintics are dependent on the choice of the biological host under study. In vivo animal assays are undoubtedly the best way to test parasitic worms in their natural growth environment.5, 15, 16 These assays, however, require large quantities of the compounds, huge spaces to house the animals, long wait times, and thus higher research costs. Tests on smaller rodents such as mice and chicken are pragmatic but require about 100 mg of the chemical and are impractical for any large-scale random experiments with multiple chemicals. For these reasons, in vitro assays are the preferred choice in parasitology, especially for primary screening. Standard in vitro assays measure the egg count, larvae development, migration through membrane filters, and electrophysiological signals of muscle tissues and ion channels.13, 17, 18 Caenorhabditis elegans is an established small animal model in parasitology for studying novel drug targets and modes of drug action.14, 19, 20, 21 The key reasons that contribute to its wide acceptability are its matured genetics, short lifespan, small size, and conserved genes through generations. Moreover, the relative ease of culturing C. elegans on agarose plates under standard laboratory conditions is in contrast to culturing parasitic worms that have complex life cycles.4, 22, 23, 24 In this context, microfluidics has served as an enabling technology to study the effects of different drugs and toxins on single or multiple C. elegans.25, 26, 27 Microfluidic devices have integrated various techniques (e.g., droplet generation, automated valve operations, suction, image recognition, laser ablation) to demonstrate high-throughput methods of loading, immobilizing, sorting, and phenotyping worm populations.28, 29 While these technological advancements are commendable, it is reasonable to state that almost all microfluidic-enabled drug studies on C. elegans portray the drug effect using a single parameter measured at a finite time (e.g., velocity, stroke frequency).30, 31 Macroscopic, inhibition migration assays also count the percentage of worms surviving a chemical media within a finite time and plot the data as a dose response curve.7, 9, 11, 17 Are there other ways to characterize drug effects in these animals besides using a single parameter measured at end-points of the experiments? If different drugs are chosen at the same potency level, will they all exhibit a similar response on worm populations through the exposure time? We hypothesized that the effect of a certain drug could change over the length of experiment (as C. elegans is known to adapt to their environment)32 and quantifying the patterns of worm adaptation could be used as a means to differentiate different drugs. To test the above hypothesis, we used a two-dimensional microfluidic platform25 with real-time imaging and a custom worm tracking software. Four anthelmintics are chosen that act on the neuromuscular system of the C. elegans: pyrantel, levamisole, methyridine, and tribendimidine. In each case, the drug concentration used is EC75 or where 75% of worms are responsive to the drug. The worms are exposed to the individual drugs in a microfluidic device and their activity is recorded for 40 min. Upon initial exposure, an active worm shows three types of movement patterns; crawling, curling, and flailing. After prolonged exposure, the active worm shows periods of being immobile before finally succumbing to the drug. We characterize these behavioral changes by a set of parameters and compared the results among the four drugs. Finally, with an attempt to show the usefulness of this characterization technique for future drug screening, we justify our findings about the efficacy of individual drugs using previous literature.MATERIALS AND METHODS Device fabrication The microfluidic device is fabricated using soft lithography.25, 26 The device design is drawn in AutoCADTM and sent out to an outside vendor (Fineline ImagingTM) for printing the physical mask. A UV-sensitive polymer, SU-8, is spin-coated on a clean, 3-in. silicon wafer to create a 80 μm thick layer. The SU-8 is photolithographically patterned with features on the physical mask and developed. Then, particle desorption mass spectrometry (PDMS) polymer is poured on the SU-8 master mold and allowed to dry overnight in a low-pressure chamber at room temperature. The dried PDMS is peeled off the SU-8 master mold, punched with holes for the fluidic ports, and irreversibly bonded to a glass slide—thus creating our microfluidic device. The SU-8 master mold is re-used multiple times to create new PDMS structures. Each microfluidic device, however, is used only once for a single experiment.Experimental setup The microfluidic device is physically taped to a microscope stage and filled in a two-step procedure as shown in Fig. 1. The filling procedure is modified from our previous work.25 Earlier, we filled the straight microchannels with agarose gel and then filled the drug well with the drug solution. Worms were drawn into the microchannel and drug well using electrotaxis. Electric fields were continuously applied through the experiment to prevent worms from leaving the drug well. Here, the filling procedure was changed to apply electric fields only in the beginning of the experiment. In the first step, 0.8% agarose gel is loaded in a 1 ml syringe and slowly filled into the straight microchannel. The filling is stopped when the forward profile of agarose gel, observed under the microscope, reaches the tapered mouth of the microchannel. L4-stage C. elegans are picked from a culture plate with a sterilized wire and dropped at the input port. After a wait time of around 5–7 min, the worms penetrate the agarose gel, enter the microchannel, and migrate towards the tapered mouth. As the drug well is filled with air, the worms are restricted in the microchannel. In the second step, anthelmintic solution under test is prepared to a pre-specified concentration and filled in the drug well through a side port. Specifically, in the cases of levamisole, pyrantel, and methyridine, the drug well is filled with a mixture of 0.8% agarose prepared in M9 buffer and the anthelmintic. In the case of tribendimidine, a mixture of 0.8% agarose prepared in M9 buffer and the anthelmintic dissolved in 1% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is used. For control experiments, 0.8% agarose in M9 buffer (with and without 1% DMSO) is used. We previously concluded that there is minimal diffusion of fluorescein from the drug well during a 45-min experiment.25 Figure 1. Open in a new tab Images of the experimental setup. (a) A stereozoom microscope with a computer-controlled camera is used to record and analyze real-time videos of worms in microfluidic devices. (b) Snapshot of a microfluidic chip comprising multiple devices fabricated in PDMS polymer and bonded to a glass slide. (c) A magnified image of a single microfluidic device comprising a straight microchannel that merges into a circular drug well through a tapered mouth. The empty device (left) is first filled with 0.8% agarose gel (mixed with yellow food dye here) and worms are allowed to enter through the input port (middle). Thereafter, the drug solution in agarose gel (mixed with blue food dye here) is filled in the drug well (right).To attract the worms to enter into the drug well, on-chip electrotaxis is used.25 Two platinum electrodes are inserted in the agarose gel, one in the input port and one in the side port, and connected to a d.c. voltage supply by electrical cables. The net resistance between the platinum electrodes is measured to ensure there is a finite resistance of around 1–2 MΩ. An electric field is applied (∼5 V/cm) between the two electrodes and worms are coaxed into entering the drug well. From placing the worms on the input port to the start of data collection, the wait time is around 10 min. This time also allows the animals to acclimatize to the microfluidic environment. A Leica MZ16 stereozoom microscope is connected with a high-speed QImaging camera for real-time recording of worm behavior in the drug well. The QCapture software is programmed to record grayscale images of the drug well (every second) for a period of 40 min. Subsequently, the images are stitched into a single.avi file for data analysis. Each experiment is conducted with a certain number of worms (n ≅ 3 to 5) and repeated over at least 4 independent trials (N > = 4). With every drug test, control experiments are conducted in parallel. Statistical analysis on the data is performed using the GraphPad Prism software.RESULTS Previously, we reported the dose response (i.e., percentage of worms responsive to the applied electric field) of C. elegans upon exposure to levamisole.25 Using a similar protocol, experiments are conducted with three other anthelmintics (tribendimidine, pyrantel, and methyridine) and the C. elegans dose response is plotted in Fig. 2. To characterize the mode of paralysis in each drug, we chose a critical concentration where 25% of the worms are responsive to the applied electric field (i.e., where 75% of the worms are responsive to the drug, EC75). At EC100, worms paralyzed within a very short time to allow any characterization of drug effects; while at EC50, worms took over an hour to paralyze resulting in larger videos and longer analysis time. We chose EC75 as a reasonable concentration for drug potency as most worms paralyzed within 20–25 min with adequate time for exhibiting their drug response. From Fig. 2, this concentration for each drug is as follows: 30 μm levamisole, 100 μm tribendimidine, 150 μm pyrantel, and 10 mM methyridine. Next, we show that even at these equipotent concentrations, each drug have a distinct signature effect on worm populations observed over the entire experimental time. Figure 2. Open in a new tab The dose response of C. elegans (represented as the percentage of worms responsive to electrical fields) is plotted for the four drugs used: pyrantel, levamisole, methyridine, and tribendimidine.Frequency of body curls One of our first observations indicated that worms tend to curl more often in drug environments than in control conditions. Fig. 3a shows a series of images to describe the progression of a curl exhibited by a sample worm in the microfluidic drug well. For our analysis, a curl is defined as an event that occurs when a worm's head touches or overlaps its tail. Using this definition, we manually count the total number of curls exhibited by an actively moving worm before it eventually paralyzes. Thereafter, the frequency of body curls (i.e., number of curls per second) is calculated by dividing the total number of curls by the total active time. The frequency of body curls is calculated as follows: 0.007 ± 0.005 for agar, 0.010 ± 0.010 for DMSO, 0.042 ± 0.030 for pyrantel, 0.031 ± 0.020 for levamisole, 0.014 ± 0.010 for methyridine, and 0.032 ± 0.026 for tribendimidine. In Fig. 3b, we plot the frequency of body curls as a box plot representation. Here, the bottom and top of each box correspond to the first and third quartiles, respectively, while the horizontal line inside the box denotes the median. The ends of whiskers are the minimum and maximum values of the data set. We compared the results of pyrantel, levamisole, and methyridine with their corresponding control (i.e., 0.8% agarose) and tribendimidine with its control (i.e., 0.8% agarose and 1% DMSO). There is no significant difference between the two control groups. However, the curl frequency is significantly higher in pyrantel and levamisole (p < 0.0001). Between DMSO and tribendimidine, we observed a significantly higher curl frequency in tribendimidine (p < 0.0001). The curl frequency is significantly lower in methyridine than in pyrantel, levamisole, and tribendimidine (p < 0.0001). This indicates that curling is not as predominant in methyridine as in other compounds. To describe the action of methyridine and to further differentiate among other drugs, we needed more parameters that could be extracted from recorded videos. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Body curls in actively moving C. elegans upon exposure to anthelmintics. (a) Snapshots of a representative worm (every 500 ms) as it curls its body such that the head touches or overlaps its tail. (b) Frequency of body curls (i.e., the number of curls divided by the total time a worm stays active) is plotted for the four drugs and control conditions (i.e., in 0.8% agarose gel and DMSO).Mode transitions in an actively moving worm: Crawling, curling, or flailing Besides frequent curling actions, an actively moving worm exhibits changes from its natural sinusoidal movement when exposed to drug environments. As shown in Fig. 4a, we categorize the nature of a worm's body displacement into three modes: crawling, curling, and flailing. Crawling is the undulatory, sinusoidal movement of a worm that results in forward or backward locomotion.33 Curling, as defined earlier, occurs when the worm's head touches or overlaps its tail. Flailing happens when a worm oscillates its body in half waves about a fixed location and is an unusual swimming-like behavior we observed in 0.8% agarose gel. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Mode transitions between crawling, curling, and flailing. (a) Snapshots of representative worms during curling (head coiled to or beyond the tail), crawling (sinusoidal movement), and flailing (swimming movement with no net displacement). (b) Boxplot representations of the transition frequency (rate of switching between crawling, curling, and flailing) within 30 s (left), 60 s (middle), and 120 s (right) from the time of entering the drug well.During an experiment, an active worm may exhibit any of the three abovementioned modes of movement (i.e., crawling, curling, and flailing). We manually counted the transitions made by an active worm amongst the three modes of movement. The number of mode transitions is counted within three time periods (30 s, 60 s, and 120 s) from the instance a worm enters into the drug well. A transition frequency is calculated by dividing the number of mode transitions by the time periods of observation. These data are plotted in Fig. 4b. The transition frequency is significantly higher in methyridine than in tribendimidine (p < 0.01 in 30 s, p < 0.001 in 60 and 120 s). The transition frequency is also significantly higher in pyrantel than in tribendimidine (p < 0.05 in 30 s, p < 0.01 in 60 and 120 s). Between levamisole and methyridine, there is significant difference in the 30 s and 120 s periods (p < 0.05). Interestingly, worms exhibited more frequent flailing motion in methyridine than in the other three drugs. In control tests with agar (data not shown), there are no mode transitions because all worms are seen crawling with no curling or flailing.Immobilization patterns leading to paralysis: Being active, temporarily, or permanently immobilized As the time of exposure increases, a drug may cause an actively moving worm to show periods of being (partially or completely) immobilized. We grouped these immobilization patterns into three categories: being active, temporarily immobilized or permanently immobilized. From our definition, a worm is considered active (or actively moving) if its entire body is displaced from its original location within a given timeframe (1 s in our case). A worm is permanently immobilized if its entire body remains stationary for at least 600 s, after which we denote the worm as being paralyzed. Our videos indicate that worms that remained immobilized for 600 s never recovered through the length of experiment. A worm is temporarily immobilized if parts of its body (and not the entire body) are still moving or if it can become active after being completely immobile for a certain time period (less than 600 s). Fig. 5a illustrates the immobilization patterns for a sample worm in the microfluidic device. We used a custom worm tracking program to locate the body centroid of individual worms in the drug well over the length of the video.25 Tracks of a sample worm are plotted to show three cycles periods of being active and temporarily immobilized. During each active period, the worm moves freely and its track appears linear; while in each temporarily immobilized period, a part of the worm's body shows spasm-like events and its track appears to be zigzag without much displacement. Eventually, the worm may enter a permanently immobilized period where it becomes completely motionless for over 600 s. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Immobilization patterns leading to paralysis. (a) Snapshots of a representative worm undergoing periods of being active and temporarily immobilized. A custom worm tracking program25 is used to mark the x-y co-ordinates of the worm's body centroid as a function of time (shown in red). (b) The plot shows the percentage of worms that are active (shaded as checkerboard), temporarily immobilized (shaded as horizontal lines), or permanently immobilized (shaded as solid) at the end of 40 min of drug exposure.Fig. 5b plots the percentage of worms that were active, temporarily immobilized, or permanently immobilized at the end of their 40 min drug exposure. In control conditions, a negligible fraction of worms is permanently immobilized. Compared to other drugs, a higher percentage of worms (68%) remain active in methyridine. In pyrantel, none of the worms are active and the population is either temporarily (53.33%) or permanently immobilized (46.66%). The percentages of permanently immobilized worms are comparatively higher in pyrantel and tribendimidine (48.57%) than in other chemical media.Active and immobilization periods: Count and time duration Thus far, we characterized an actively moving worm by transitions between crawling, curling, and flailing. We saw that prolonged drug exposure can cause an active worm to enter temporary or permanent immobilization, which was measured at the end of the 40-min experiment. To add further insights to the time-dependent progression of drug activity, we explored how often and how long an active worm enters periods of immobilization before completely succumbing to the drug. The time duration a worm spends in each active or immobilization period also varies in the four drug environments. In Fig. 6, we plot the time spent by worms in the individual active and immobilization period, respectively. A permanently immobilized worm is ignored for subsequent analyses. In Fig. 7, we plot the probability for a worm being active. Active worms are assigned a probability of 1, and immobile worms have a probability of 0. The median of time durations during each active or immobilization period (from Fig. 6) is estimated and used to plot this figure. In general, the time spent in each active period (shown as green bars, Fig. 6) decreases with increasing exposure time. On the other hand, the time spent in each immobilization period (shown as red bars, Fig. 6) increases with increasing exposure time (except for pyrantel). In other words, an active worm starts pausing for longer time durations (with shorter periods of being active) upon increasing exposure to the drug. In tribendimidine, the time spent in the first two immobilization periods is significantly higher than in other drugs (p < 0.0001). In some worms, the effect of levamisole exposure is even reversible suggesting that this drug may be the least potent amongst the four anthelmintics. All worms remained active in 0.8% agarose and never entered the second immobilization period. Figure 6. Open in a new tab The figure shows the time duration worms spend in each active and immobilization periods until they are permanently immobilized. Each pair of active and immobilization periods is numbered sequentially in the y-axis.Figure 7. Open in a new tab The figure shows the probability of a worm being active during the length of drug exposure. The median of time durations for active and immobilized periods are calculated from Figure 6. The probability of a worm being active is denoted as 1 while that of being immobilized is denoted as 0.DISCUSSION Some modifications were made in our device design and methodology to simplify the earlier experimental method25 and optimize it for observing events leading to worm paralysis. It was seen that electric field was needed only initially to coax the worms into the drug well. When sufficient number of worms entered the drug well, the electric field was switched off (typically after the first 5–7 min). At the optimal range of electric fields (∼5 V/cm), we did not observe any behavioral changes in the presence of electric fields.25 In addition, the device dimensions were altered to minimize the chances of a worm leaving the drug well in absence of electric fields. For this, the tapered mouth was made narrower and only one side port was included. The two-step agarose filling process (Fig. 1) was also better controlled with a narrower mouth and allowed us to control the time instance when worms enter the drug well. The length of the microchannel was shortened, so the wait time for worm entry into the drug well is reduced. Shrinking the lateral dimensions of every device allowed us to fit up to four devices within the microscope's field of view for parallel runs. Furthermore, in contrast to quantifying drug effects by the sensitivity of electric fields at pre- and post-exposure time instances,25 we extracted parameters related to movement, immobilization, and body shapes through the period of drug exposure and attempted to show differences across four drugs. In equipotent concentrations of both pyrantel and levamisole, the worms exhibited similar movement phenotypes. We observed that an active worm moves in a sinusoidal manner with periods of immobilization where it curls its body and eventually paralyzes. In both chemical environments, a worm undergoes at least five to six active and immobilization periods (Figs. 67). The average time spent in each active period is similar in both cases and markedly distinct compared to those in methyridine and tribendimidine (Fig. 6). The inherent similarities between movement phenotypes in pyrantel and levamisole do suggest that these drugs act on the same subtype of nAChR receptors (i.e., L-subtype).7, 8, 9, 11, 34 However, there are some differences between pyrantel and levamisole. The average time spent in each immobilization period is longer in pyrantel than in levamisole (Fig. 6). In other words, an active worm in pyrantel prefers to rest longer, curl up, or move less often; whereas an active worm in levamisole spends similar time durations being active or resting/curling. This is also reflected in Fig. 5 where, at the end of an experiment, no worms in pyrantel appear active and are either temporarily or permanently immobilized; whereas around 30% worms are still active in levamisole. These differences suggest that pyrantel may be more effective than levamisole, even being at the same potency concentrations.7 A comparison between tribendimidine and the other two L-subtype nAChR agonists, levamisole and pyrantel, is worth discussing here. It has been shown that tribendimidine affects C. elegans using a similar pathway as levamisole and hence belong to the same class of L-subtype nAChR agonists.6 Since these three drugs have similar mechanisms of action, should we expect differences in the patterns of paralysis? In general, movement phenotypes in tribendimidine are same as those in pyrantel and levamisole. One key difference is noted in the number of active periods and duration of immobilization. In tribendimidine, the number of active periods is reduced and the time duration of immobilization periods is much increased compared to those in levamisole or pyrantel (Fig. 6). This may indicate that tribendimidine is more effective at a single dose than levamisole or pyrantel. Evidence of tribendimidine's superior performance compared to the other two L-type nAChR agonists (i.e., levamisole and pyrantel) at single-dose levels has also been suggested in recent studies performed on treating Ascaris or hookworms.35, 36 In addition, the increased number of active periods in levamisole may indicate that worms could recover from drug exposure, if given at concentrations below 10 μm with recovery time over 2 h (data not shown). Hence, we feel that our derived parameters (such as number of active periods and time durations of immobilization) could help compare the effectiveness of a single or a cocktail of multiple anthelmintics for single dose therapies where irreversible paralysis is desired. Of course, this characterization method would serve as a preliminary test to supplement standard in vivo experiments.12 In methyridine, we noticed a distinct departure from the movement phenotype associated with levamisole, pyrantel, and tribendimidine. In this drug, worms exhibited a swimming-like motion where the body formed half waves during moving. Occasionally, the worms would thrash about a fixed location (that we defined as flailing) and then continue their swimming-like motion. Swimming motion is typically seen in C. elegans when the surrounding medium is liquid. It was interesting to observe this swimming-like behavior in the presence of methyridine where the surrounding medium was 0.8% agarose gel. Considering that methyridine acts on the same nAChR receptor, our observed difference in movement could suggest that this drug acts on a different subtype of nAChR receptor. This assumption is in line with previous studies showing that methyridine target N-subtype nAChR receptors and not the L-subtype nAChR receptors.11 In our view, this microfluidic-enabled characterization method will broaden the scope of data extraction from drug screening experiments, improve our understanding of worm resistance and adaptability in adverse chemical environments, and provide faster ways of predicting new and existing drug targets prior to detailed electrophysiological experiments. To the best of our knowledge, such a detailed characterization of worm paralysis upon exposure to anthelmintics has not been conducted before. While we investigated behavioral changes in wild-type C. elegans leading to paralysis, further tests with relevant mutants and parasites could help establish relationships between molecular mechanisms of drug action and the observed phenotypes.1, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 In this regard, C. elegans and other model organisms are gaining increased attention for the rapid screening of large sets of small molecules (e.g., membrane-permeable inhibitors of protein function) that induce phenotypic changes in the worm, such as lethality, unco-ordinated movement, slow growth and development, and morphological defects.42 It is expected that the process of discovering novel drugs would rely on large-scale behavioral screening of worms, measurement of multiple parameters with sufficient resolution, standardization of observed phenotypes across disparate platforms, and linkage between the chemical and behavioral libraries.43, 44 Interested readers, who wish to use and test our devices on other chemicals or mutants, are welcome to directly email the corresponding author (S.P.). We can provide the fabricated microfluidic devices and tracking software, and discuss the steps for setting up experiments. The device dimensions can be further altered and customized for other parasitic nematodes. A standard desktop computer compatible with Microsoft Windows 7, a large-capacity hard drive, and a microscope with attached camera will be required.CONCLUSION In summary, we presented a method to characterize the behavioral events of C. elegans over an extended time period: from exposure to the drug to their eventual paralysis. We found that a single parameter was unable to capture the overall drug effects through the experimental period. So, multiple parameters were calculated, such as curls per second, types of paralyzation, mode frequency, and number/duration of active/immobilization periods. We found that pyrantel is more effective than levamisole in immobilizing the worms at the end of the 40-min experiments. In tribendimidine, worms display shorter number of active periods before permanently immobilizing than in pyrantel or levamisole. In methyridine, worms exhibit a swimming-like movement that is different from the normal crawling movement in pyrantel, levamisole, and tribendimidine. Our results may suggest the following: methyridine acts on a different subtype of nAChR receptors than the other three anthelmintics, the action of pyrantel and levamisole is similar but pyrantel is more effective than levamisole, and tribendimidine is more potent than pyrantel or levamisole in causing an irreversible paralysis of the worms. This multi-parameter extraction method expands the repertoire of phenotypic characterization tools available in existing drug-based microfluidic devices. In addition, the method could complement rigorous electrophysiological experiments to rapidly test screen compounds against nematodes, establish suitable drug candidates, and predict the class of target receptor subtypes.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to Jo Anne Powell-Coffman for providing C. elegans culture plates, and Alan P.

    "abstract": "Abstract Environmental toxicants influence development, behavior, and ultimately survival. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be an exceptionally powerful model for toxicological studies. Here, we develop novel technologies to describe the effects of cyanide toxicity with high spatiotemporal resolution. Importantly, we use these methods to examine the genetic underpinnings of cyanide resistance. Caenorhabditis elegans that lack the EGL-9 oxygen sensing enzyme have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We demonstrate that the cyanide resistance exhibited by egl-9 mutants is completely dependent on the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and is mediated by the cysl-2 cysteine synthase, which likely functions in metabolic pathways that inactivate cyanide. Further, the expression of cysl-2 correlates with the degree of cyanide resistance exhibited in each genetic background. We find that each mutant exhibits similar relative resistance to HCN gas on plates or to aqueous potassium cyanide in microfluidic chambers. The design of the microfluidic devices, in combination with real-time imaging, addresses a series of challenges presented by mutant phenotypes and by the chemical nature of the toxicant. The microfluidic assay produces a set of behavioral parameters with increased resolution that describe cyanide toxicity and resistance in C. elegans, and this is particularly useful in analyzing subtle phenotypes. These multiparameter analyses of C. elegans behavior hold great potential as a means to monitor the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time and to study the biological networks that underpin toxicant resistance.

    "results": "Results Overactivation of HIF-1 Confers Resistance to HCN Gas Prior studies have shown that egl-9-deficient worms could survive concentrations of HCN gas that killed wild-type worms (Gallagher and Manoil, 2001). In the experiments shown in Figure 1, we monitored the effects of HCN gas on worm motility at 30-min time points for a total of 150min and then examined the abilities of the animals to recover from this. As shown in Figure 1b, wild-type animals were rapidly immobilized in the presence of HCN gas. In contrast, the egl-9-deficient animals (Fig. 1c) were motile even after 2.5h and foraged actively on the plates despite exposure to the toxicant. We hypothesized that the HCN resistance exhibited by egl-9-deficient mutants was due, in whole or in part, to overactivation of HIF-1. To test this, we compared the responses to HCN of egl-9 mutants with those animals that carried loss-of-function mutations in both egl-9 and hif-1. The double mutants were rapidly immobilized in the presence of cyanide gas (Fig. 1d), and this phenotype was very similar to that of hif-1 single mutant animals (Supplementary fig. S1). These results confirmed that the resistance to HCN gas conferred by a loss-of-function mutation in egl-9 was dependent on hif-1 function.Partial Loss-of-Function Mutations in egl-9 Confer Intermediate Resistance Phenotypes Prior genetic studies had isolated and characterized several different mutations in egl-9. Severe loss-of-function mutations, such as egl-9(sa307), had been shown to cause egg-laying defects and dramatic overexpression of numerous HIF-1 targets (Darby et al., 1999; Shao et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2006; Trent et al., 1983). With respect to these phenotypes, the defects conferred by the egl-9(sa330) and egl-9(ia60) mutations have been shown to be less severe (Darby et al., 1999; Shao et al., 2009). We tested the hypothesis that animals carrying the egl-9(sa330) or egl-9(ia60) mutations would have less resistance to HCN gas compared with egl-9(sa307). As seen in Figures 1e and 1f, these less severe mutations resulted in an intermediate resistance phenotype. By 2.5h of exposure to the cyanide gas, these mutants were unable to actively forage on the plates. When left to recover from HCN gas exposure, they soon regained their motility. While observing the phenotypes, we found that there was a subtle difference in the extent and nature of limited motility of the egl-9(ia60) and the egl-9(sa330) alleles but were unable to quantify it readily by manual scoring. These phenotypes demonstrated the need to diagnose behavioral responses to toxicants with higher spatiotemporal resolution. Additionally, we sought to develop technologies that would support the analysis of water-soluble toxicants, including KCN. Accordingly, we designed microfluidic devices coupled to real-time imaging and data analysis platforms. The HCN gas assays in Figure 1 provided a valuable benchmark, as we developed novel and reliable cyanide toxicity assays in microfluidic systems.Design of the Microfluidic Device We proceeded to design a microfluidic chip suitable for assaying small, fast-acting toxicants. Unfortunately, existing devices were not optimal for KCN toxicity studies, so the design of a novel chip proved crucial to our experiments. In prior studies, we had fabricated microfluidic devices to measure the dose-dependent effects of levamisole (an anthelminthic drug) on the movement of C. elegans in real time and at high resolution (Carr et al., 2011b). Even though these devices were later tested with other anthelmintic drugs, they could not be adopted for cyanide assays because of three main obstacles. First, they relied upon an electric field to guide the worms (i.e., electrotaxis), and an electric field would dissociate KCN molecules. In addition, some mutants of interest were not as sensitive to the applied electric fields as the wild-type C. elegans. Initial tests indicated that electrotaxis of egl-9 mutants required electric fields at higher voltage ranges (10–12V) that incapacitate wild-type worms. Second, it was difficult to contain the free-moving worms within the previously constructed microfluidic chamber in the presence of cyanide. We observed that worms responded quickly to KCN solution by trying to escape the chamber, and they explored potential points of exit. In many cases, within a few minutes of cyanide application, worms were found swimming on the liquid surface in the exit ports. Third, agarose was not a suitable medium for observing worm movement, particularly for egl-9 mutants. These mutants frequently paused in agarose-filled microfluidic chambers, sometimes for as long as 20min of observation. We also developed and tested alternate devices with soil-like pillar structures (Lockery et al., 2008), but the egl-9 mutants paused in between the pillars. The custom chip that we designed for this study overcomes these obstacles. It enables the worms to move freely in aqueous solutions but does not allow them to escape. The chip was designed to have nine chambers, wherein three chambers were used simultaneously during an experimental run (Figs. 2c and 2d). The dimensions of the chambers (length = 3.5mm, width = 1.8mm, and height = 80 µm) were chosen to fit the field of view of the microscope under a suitable magnification with sufficient volume to allow for free C. elegans swimming while also maintaining the animals in a single plane of focus. Each chamber, in turn, had a one-way input port with a tapered neck (width = 25 µm and height = 80 µm) for sample injection (Fig. 2d). This design allowed us to simply push the worms into the chamber from one side but prevented them from escaping back through the port.Presence of Food as an Essential Factor for Consistent Worm Movement In experiments designed to optimize the conditions for behavioral analyses in microfluidic devices, we determined that bacterial food promoted consistent movement. In the absence of food, the egl-9 mutants had a tendency to rest for long periods of time, resulting in a great variability in centroid velocity (Supplementary fig. S2). This resting behavior was also displayed in other environments that lacked food, including agarose plates or microfluidic chambers filled with agarose gel or PDMS support pillars (data not shown). However, when a suspension of buffer and food was used, the worms moved more consistently (compare Supplementary fig. S2 and Figs. 3b and 3c). This shows that food can be an important variable in microfluidic behavioral studies. In the experiments described herein, we ensured that the animals had ample food. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Effects of cyanide on worm velocity in the microfluidic assay. (a) In this diagram, the red-dotted line denotes the representative path of the body centroid. The velocity was calculated using the worm’s centroid positions [(x 1, y 1) and (x 2, y 2)] at their two successive time instances (t 1 and t 2). (b–f) Average velocity of body centroid in control (blue) and 0.5mM liquid cyanide (red) conditions. In all the plots, the centroid velocity was calculated by taking the average of all instantaneous velocities of all animals (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7).Multiparameter Behavioral Analysis in Aqueous Cyanide Solution To more completely and accurately define the effects of KCN on wild-type and mutant animals, we used real-time imaging of C. elegans in microfluidic chambers to address the following questions: Are the effects of KCN immediate, or do C. elegans slow down over time? What is the range of velocities exhibited by a population in the presence of the toxicant? Do our data support the hypothesis that mutations that protect C. elegans from HCN gas also protect the animals from aqueous KCN? For experiments examining cyanide response phenotypes in microfluidic devices, individual chambers were filled with chemical solutions described in Materials and Methods section and illustrated in Figure 2. Single L4 stage worms were then inserted into the microfluidic chambers, and their movement was recorded for 1000 s. The worm tracking program produced a list of body centroid locations for each animal as a function of time, which provided quantitative information on the resistance phenotypes. Average velocity of body centroid. To assess the effects of cyanide on wild-type and mutant animals, we placed the animals in the microfluidic chamber, tracked movement over time, and calculated the velocity of the body centroid. More precisely, we calculated the ratio of the net distance between two successive points to the net change in time (1 s). An example is shown in Figure 3a, in which a worm located at centroid position (x 1, y 1) at time instance t 1 swam to another centroid position (x 2, y 2) at time instance t 2. The red-dotted line denotes the path of the body centroid, and the centroid velocity v 21 can be expressed by Equation 1: (1) The effects of KCN on wild-type worms were evident from time 0. In Figures 3b–f, the plots provide information on the magnitude of overall average centroid velocity for particular populations at every second. The blue lines represent the control conditions, whereas the red lines show average centroid velocities in the presence of 0.5mM KCN. Notably, the average centroid velocity of wild-type worms did not change markedly over the 1000 s of recording (Fig. 3b). In contrast to the wild-type animals, the egl-9(sa307) mutants showed similar average centroid velocities both in control conditions (122±19 µm/s) and in cyanide solution (127±21 µm/s). Interestingly, in the first few seconds of the assay, the egl-9(sa307) animals moved faster in the presence of KCN compared with controls. As predicted, the KCN resistance phenotype exhibited by egl-9(sa307) mutants was suppressed by a loss-of-function mutation in hif-1 (compare Figs. 3c and 3d). We also assayed two weaker alleles of egl-9. As shown in Figure 3e, the egl-9(ia60) mutants were slowed by KCN, but not to the degree that wild-type worms were. The KCN had relatively little effect on the centroid velocity of egl-9(sa330) animals (Fig. 3f).Total distance covered by the body centroid. To understand the summative consequences of changes in movement over time, we calculated the total distance traveled by each population assayed. Figures 4a–c depict the movement of representative individuals in the microfluidic device. Figure 4d plots the average distance travelled by the worms’ body centroid during 1000 s within the microfluidic chambers. Using two-way ANOVA, we tested the hypothesis that the effect of the toxicant was dependent on the genotype. Under control conditions, the wild-type and egl-9(sa307) mutants roughly covered the same distance (133±33mm), but wild-type animals traveled significantly less distance in the KCN solution (40±13mm, p < 0.0001). The egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) double mutant also showed a significant decrease from 89±42mm in control to 37±7mm in cyanide solution (p < 0.0002). In control conditions, the egl-9(sa330) strain covered the maximum distance, relative to other strains tested. The egl-9(ia60) strain showed a significant decrease in the distance covered upon cyanide exposure (from 145±37mm in control to 90±44mm in cyanide solution, p < 0.0001). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Total distance traveled in the microfluidic chambers. (a–c) Examples of tracks of animals differently affected by the toxicant. (a) Tracks representative of wild-type animals that exhibited periods of limited motility and eventually ceased movement. (b) Tracks representative of the egl-9(ia60) and egl-9(sa330) animals that exhibited periods of limited motility in the presence of the toxicant but did not become immotile. (c) Tracks representative of egl-9(sa307) animals that continued to swim around the chamber throughout the experiment. (d) The average distance travelled by the worms within 1000 s of recording is shown (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7). *p < 0.0002, two-way ANOVA.Do the cyanide-induced decreases in distance traveled reflect a slow-moving worm with uniform velocity or a relatively fast-moving worm that pauses intermittently? Is the answer the same for all individuals in a population? To address these questions, we examined the movement patterns of individual animals (Fig. 5). We also calculated mean velocities for each condition (Fig. 6), and we quantified the times that worms were immotile (Fig. 7). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Behavioral raster plots of the centroid velocities. In our color scheme, white color denotes a maximum velocity of 500 µm/s and black color denotes a minimum velocity of 0 µm/s. Within every raster plot, each individual row corresponds to a distinct animal that is tracked for 1000 s and the color intensity of each pixel corresponds to the animal’s instantaneous velocity (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7). The wild-type and egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) double mutants show a distinctly slower velocity in cyanide solution (as shown by a darker raster) compared with that in control conditions. The egl-9(sa307) mutants had similar velocities in both control and experimental conditions (as shown by a lighter raster).Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Range and distribution of the average centroid velocities. Compared with egl-9(sa307) mutant animals, the other genotypes showed a decrease in their mean velocities when exposed to 0.5mM KCN (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7).Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Number of pauses in the microfluidic chambers. Pauses were counted as time instances (within the entire 1000 s) when the centroid velocity was less than a threshold velocity of 15 µm/s. (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7).Behavioral raster representation of instantaneous centroid velocity. To more fully understand the effects of the toxicant, we examined the range of responses exhibited by individual worms. Figure 5 represents the instantaneous centroid velocities in microfluidic devices as behavioral raster plots. Each row is a collection of pixels, where the color intensity of each pixel reflects the relative instantaneous centroid velocity of an individual worm that is tracked for 1000 s: from light tan indicating high velocity to dark brown indicating no movement. The plots thus provide a very detailed look at the distribution of individual worm velocities. egl-9(sa307) mutant animals showed a lighter raster in both the control and experimental conditions with almost no pauses. Worms with the weaker allele, egl-9(ia60), had a relatively darker raster in the cyanide solution compared with that in control conditions. In some cases, animals paused for long intervals, and this is illustrated by the darkest portions of the raster for individual worms. A few of the wild-type and the egl-9(ia60) mutants were inactive for long intervals. Interestingly, approximately half of the egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) double mutants paused for extended periods in control conditions. This behavior was less evident in the presence of KCN, which suppressed movement in all the wild-type and hif-1-deficient worms assayed. The egl-9(sa330) animals moved quickly and paused infrequently.Range and distribution of average centroid velocity. Recognizing the variable responses of individual animals as illustrated in the raster plots, we interrogated these phenotypes further by calculating the distribution of centroid velocities achieved by each genotype in each condition. This is shown in Figure 6. This range and distribution of velocities is estimated by counting the occurrences of velocity values within intervals of 20 µm/s for all worms tested under control or experimental conditions. In control conditions, the mean velocities for wild-type and egl-9(sa307) animals were 133±19 and 123±19 µm/s, respectively. In cyanide solution, the mean velocity for egl-9(sa307) worms showed no significant change (127±21 µm/s, p > 0.05), whereas the mean velocity for wild-type worms decreased significantly (40±6 µm/s, p < 0.0001). Compared with wild type, the egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) worms exhibited a slightly lower mean velocity in control conditions (89±25 µm/s), but they showed a significant decrease in cyanide solution (37±7 µm/s). Consistent with the raster plots for individual worm velocities (Fig. 5), the egl-9(sa330) animals moved relatively faster than other worm types in control conditions (182±28 µm/s) with a wider range. In cyanide solution, the mean velocity of the egl-9(sa330) animals decreased to 155±23 µm/s. The egl-9(ia60) mutants behaved similar to wild-type animals in control conditions (143±23 µm/s) but did not show a dramatic decrease in mean velocity upon cyanide exposure (90±19 µm/s).Pausing behavior. To further define this behavior, we identified and quantified the instances in which individual worms slowed to velocities in the 0–15 µm/s range. These data are shown as boxplots in Figure 7. To our advantage, the worm tracking program was particularly sensitive in detecting miniscule changes in centroid velocity with a resolution of 7.5 µm/s. After recording the videos, the worm velocities extracted from the software were compared manually. We noticed that a centroid velocity of 15 µm/s corresponded to worms that exhibited only small changes in body posture and were otherwise immotile. Hence, we chose 15 µm/s as the threshold velocity below which animals were recorded as having stopped. Cyanide caused an increased number of stops, relative to control conditions, for the wild-type animals (26 in control and 155 in cyanide) and egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) double mutants (66 in control and 197 in cyanide). By comparison, we found that the cyanide treatment did not cause the egl-9 single mutants to stop as frequently. In some cases, these analyses reveal differences that were not evident from cursory examination of the raster plots. For example, although the mean velocities of egl-9(sa307) mutants and wild-type animals are very similar in control conditions (Fig. 6), the egl-9(sa307) mutants paused more frequently than did wild-type animals in control conditions (Fig. 7).Deciphering the Role of cysl-2 in Cyanide Resistance We next investigated the role of the cysteine synthase-like gene cysl-2 in egl-9-mediated resistance to aqueous KCN. Overexpression of HIF-1 in egl-9 mutants has been shown to cause a marked increase in the expression of cysl-2/K10H10.2 mRNA (Budde and Roth, 2011; Shao et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2005, 2006). Further, during the course of our studies, Budde and Roth (2011) had demonstrated that RNAi-mediated depletion of cysl-2 caused egl-9-deficient animals to become more susceptible to HCN gas. We proposed two testable hypotheses. First, we predicted that RNAi-mediated depletion of cysl-2 would diminish the resistance of egl-9-deficient mutants to KCN in aqueous solution. Second, we hypothesized that there would be a correlation between the levels of cysl-2 mRNA and the cyanide resistance phenotypes in egl-9 mutant animals. In control experiments, we tested the hypothesis that reducing cysl-2 expression would largely suppress resistance to HCN gas in egl-9(sa307) animals; we depleted cysl-2 mRNA by feeding them bacterial food that carried double-stranded cysl-2 RNA (cysl-2 RNAi). The efficacy of the RNAi protocol was validated in parallel experiments (Supplementary fig. S3a). The egl-9(sa307) mutants treated with cysl-2 RNAi (Fig. 8a.ii) slowed down in the presence of HCN gas. By comparison, the egl-9(sa307) mutants fed control RNAi bacteria were resistant to the toxicant (Fig. 8a.i). Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Effects of cysl-2 depletion on cyanide resistance. (a) In the presence of HCN gas, egl-9(sa307) worms treated with control RNAi (i) remain motile, but cysl-2 (RNAi) (ii) suppresses this resistance phenotype (number of animals = 60 and number of independent trials = 3). (b) Average distance travelled in the microfluidic chambers. *p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA. (c) Range and distribution of the average centroid velocities show a decrease in mean velocity for cysl-2 RNAi-treated egl-9(sa307) in 0.5mM KCN compared with control conditions (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7).To examine the role of cysl-2 in KCN toxicity, we performed experiments in the microfluidic device pictured in Figure 2c. We found that depletion of cysl-2 by RNAi increased the sensitivity of egl-9(sa307) mutant animals to the toxicant. This was evidenced by a significant decrease in average distance traveled (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA; Fig. 8b) and reduced average centroid velocity (Supplementary fig. S3b). The cysl-2 RNAi did not have marked effects on the mean velocity of the egl-9(sa307) animals in control conditions, but toxicant exposure caused a decrease in mean velocity (Fig. 8c). The raster plots illustrate that these phenotypes were relatively consistent: cysl-2 RNAi caused egl-9(sa307) animals to slow appreciably in the presence of KCN (Supplementary fig. S3c). To test the hypothesis that there would be a correlation between the levels of cysl-2 mRNA and the cyanide resistance phenotypes in egl-9 mutant animals, we performed quantitative real-time PCR and assessed the levels of cysl-2 expression in egl-9(sa307), egl-9(sa330), and egl-9(ia60) mutant animals (three biological replicates for each). We found that the expression level of cysl-2 mRNA was 11-fold higher in egl-9(sa307) strong loss-of-function mutants compared with the egl-9(ia60) and egl-9(sa330) mutants (Supplementary table 1). Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the strong cyanide resistance phenotype in egl-9(sa307) mutant animals is due to higher levels of cysl-2 expression compared with the egl-9(sa330) and egl-9(ia60) mutants, which show comparatively reduced resistance.Robustness of the Assay and Device Testing for Broader Applications We investigated whether these assays could be adapted for increased throughput, as this might also broaden its applicability. Higher throughput might be accomplished most readily by increasing the number of animals in each chamber or by shortening the time of assay. We determined that inserting multiple worms (up to three) inside individual microfluidic chambers did not markedly change the cyanide resistance phenotype (Fig. 9). We measured the average centroid velocities of wild-type and egl-9(sa307) worms in control and experimental conditions. Tests were conducted by using one, two, or three worms within individual microfluidic chambers. In each set of experiments, KCN caused a significant decrease in the velocity of wild-type worms in each case (Fig. 9, p < 0.0001). This indicates that the microfluidic assay is not limited to testing a single worm per chamber but can be scaled-up for multiple worms (up to three) per chamber without losing resolution. Furthermore, we noticed that the duration of the microfluidic experiment could be shortened without losing crucial information. In other words, even though our microfluidic experiments were recorded for 1000 s, the required behavioral information could be obtained from experiments recorded for the first 300 s. As an example, the percentage reduction in average centroid velocity for worms in cyanide solution was roughly maintained throughout the experimental duration of 1000 s (Fig. 3b). Our calculations show that, for wild-type worms, the percentage reduction in average centroid velocity caused by cyanide exposure was approximately 30%, whether it was measured over 300, 600, or 900 s. This threefold decrease in experimental time will be particularly useful in further improving the efficiency of the microfluidic assay. Fig. 9. Open in a new tab Scaling-up the microfluidic technique with multiple worms in individual chambers. (a–c) Snapshots of the microfluidic chamber housing one, two, or three worms (number of animals = 12 and number of independent trials = 3). (d) Average centroid velocities of single or multiple wild-type worms in a microfluidic chamber are plotted under control conditions and 0.5mM KCN. In each of the three cases (with one, two, or three worms), there was a significant reduction in the centroid velocity upon exposure to cyanide solution (*p < 0.0001). (e) Average centroid velocities of single or multiple egl-9(sa307) worms. The number of worms in the chamber had no significant difference on the average velocity measured in each condition (p > 0.05).We designed the microfluidic chamber with the idea that it could be applicable to other water-soluble toxicants that cause acute changes in mobility, potentially inducing genotoxins, heavy metals, environmental toxicants, pharmacological products, and xenobiotics. To test this principle, we used the assay, coupled with real-time imaging, to analyze the effects of the anthelminthic drug levamisole on wild-type worm motility. As seen in Figure 10, the total distance covered by the worms steadily decreased with an increase in the concentration of the drug. Fig. 10. Open in a new tab Applicability of the microfluidic device. The distance covered by wild-type worms decreased as the concentration of the anthelminthic drug levamisole increased from 0µM (control) to 100µM (number of animals = 12 and number of independent trials = 3).",

Copyright notice ID: 3748764 PMID: 23805000 Abstract Environmental toxicants influence development, behavior, and ultimately survival. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be an exceptionally powerful model for toxicological studies. Here, we develop novel technologies to describe the effects of cyanide toxicity with high spatiotemporal resolution. Importantly, we use these methods to examine the genetic underpinnings of cyanide resistance. Caenorhabditis elegans that lack the EGL-9 oxygen sensing enzyme have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We demonstrate that the cyanide resistance exhibited by egl-9 mutants is completely dependent on the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and is mediated by the cysl-2 cysteine synthase, which likely functions in metabolic pathways that inactivate cyanide. Further, the expression of cysl-2 correlates with the degree of cyanide resistance exhibited in each genetic background. We find that each mutant exhibits similar relative resistance to HCN gas on plates or to aqueous potassium cyanide in microfluidic chambers. The design of the microfluidic devices, in combination with real-time imaging, addresses a series of challenges presented by mutant phenotypes and by the chemical nature of the toxicant. The microfluidic assay produces a set of behavioral parameters with increased resolution that describe cyanide toxicity and resistance in C. elegans, and this is particularly useful in analyzing subtle phenotypes. These multiparameter analyses of C. elegans behavior hold great potential as a means to monitor the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time and to study the biological networks that underpin toxicant resistance. Key Words: Caenorhabditis elegans, microfluidics, hypoxia-inducible factor, cyanide toxicity, transcription factor. The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be an excellent model for studying the mechanisms by which animals respond to environmental signals or toxicants (Albrecht and Bargmann, 2011; Leung et al., 2008; Zuryn et al., 2008). Advantages include a fully sequenced genome, genetic tractability, extensive knowledge of its development and anatomy, and ease of culture (Brenner, 1974). Behavioral analyses of C. elegans can be employed to assess fast-acting toxicants or pharmacological treatments that cause uncoordinated movement or paralysis. The combination of genetics and in-depth analyses of toxicant effects provides important insights to the mechanisms by which toxicants or pollutants impair animal function. There are technical challenges to assaying the effects of fast-acting aqueous toxicants. In the laboratory, C. elegans are usually cultured on agarose plates with bacterial food. If placed in a liquid droplet, the animals thrash and are difficult to image. Microfluidic devices resolve this by maintaining the animals in a single plane of focus, but animals often seek to escape chambers containing poisonous substances. To overcome these obstacles, we designed a chamber that allows mechanical insertion of individuals. We also engineered a custom port design that permits worm entry but prevents exit. Additional design modifications enable real-time imaging and chemical testing with applications for mutants that behave unpredictably in the presence of electric fields, agarose gel, or toxicants. Among the toxicants in our environment, cyanide is an especially potent poison (Beasley and Glass, 1998; Budde and Roth, 2011; Gallagher and Manoil, 2001). It is produced as a by-product of many industrial processes, chemical reactions, and even fires (Hamel, 2011). Cyanide exerts its toxic effects by irreversibly binding to iron, thereby incapacitating proteins required for aerobic respiration. This prevents normal oxygen utilization and decreases ATP production ultimately causing cellular asphyxiation and death (Beasley and Glass, 1998). Several bacteria, including the nearly ubiquitous human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, produce cyanide (Blumer and Haas, 2000), and this is especially devastating to patients with compromised respiratory or immune systems. Caenorhabditis elegans lacking a functional egl-9 gene have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogen P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Darby et al., 1999; Gallagher and Manoil, 2001; Shao et al., 2010). This is especially intriguing because the EGL-9 protein functions as a cellular oxygen sensor. EGL-9 hydroxylates the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor using oxygen as a cosubstrate, and this modification targets HIF-1 for degradation (Epstein et al., 2001). The HIF-1 transcription factor controls changes in gene expression that allow animals to adapt to oxygen deprivation (Jiang et al., 2001; Shen et al., 2005). Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans egl-9 gene cause HIF-1 to be expressed at high levels and to be overactive (Bishop et al., 2004; Epstein et al., 2001; Shen et al., 2006). This, in turn, affects C. elegans development, stress response, longevity, and behavior (Powell-Coffman, 2010). How does a loss-of-function mutation in egl-9 and the accompanying overactivation of HIF-1 protect C. elegans from cyanide toxicity? To address this question, we examined the roles of egl-9, hif-1, and the cysl-2 cysteine synthase gene in cyanide resistance, employing both HCN gas assays and real-time imaging in a custom microfluidic device to describe multiple parameters of these behavioral phenotypes. These experiments confirmed that mutations that confer resistance to the paralyzing effects of HCN gas also protect C. elegans from potassium cyanide (KCN) in the microfluidic chambers, and they illuminate the mechanisms that protect egl-9 mutant worms from cyanide toxicity. Finally, we further explored and verified the broader applicability of our microfluidic device, using the anthelminthic drug levamisole. The combination of microfluidics and automated imaging increases the power of C. elegans as a genetic model system to study the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time. MATERIALS AND METHODS Caenorhabditis elegans Strains and Culture Caenorhabditis elegans strains were grown at 20°C, on standard Nutrient Growth Media (NGM) agarose plates with Escherichia coli OP50 bacterial food, as previously described (Brenner, 1974). All experiments were performed at 20°C–22°C using L4 stage worms. The following strains were used in this study: N2 wild type, JT307 [egl-9(sa307)], ZG448 iaIs07[Pnhr-57::gfp unc-119 (+)] IV; egl-9(ia60) V, ZG493 iaIs07[Pnhr-57::gfp unc-119 (+)] IV; egl-9(sa330) V, ZG347 iaIs07[Pnhr-57::gfp unc-119 (+)] IV; egl-9 (sa307) hif-1(ia04) V, ZG175 iaIs07[Pnhr-57::gfp unc-119 (+)] IV; hif-1(ia04) V. The egl-9(sa307) allele is a 243-bp deletion and is a strong loss-of-function mutation. The ia60 mutation is a MOS1 transposon insertion in the egl-9 gene, whereas the sa330 allele is a C-to-T mutation that creates a nonsense codon at amino acid 38 (Darby et al., 1999; Shao et al., 2009). The hif-1(ia04) mutation is a 1231-bp deletion of the second, third, and fourth exons, which causes a frameshift and premature stop in the mutant mRNA (Jiang et al., 2001).HCN Gas Exposure Assay Assay setup. As shown in Figure 2a, L4 stage worms were placed on 3.5-cm NGM agarose plates in the absence of bacterial food. This plate and a separate inverted 3.5-cm lid were positioned in a larger 10-cm petri dish. The lid contained drops of 0.18M hydrochloric acid (100 µl) and a solution of KCN (0.1M) in 0.18M sodium hydroxide (250 µl). Concentrations of the chemicals used were based on previous work (Darby et al., 1999). The larger dish was then sealed with Parafilm “M” and tipped to mix the two liquids, thus generating HCN gas in the enclosed setup. For each 30-min interval in the assay, a single plate of L4 stage worms was set inside its own individual chamber. After the initial 0-min time point, five such chambers were set up in a chemical fume hood for the rest of the time points for the 2.5-h assay. For observing recovery after HCN gas exposure, the last plate of worms (150min of exposure) was placed in room air (with a lid on top), and the worms were observed every 30min. All observations of the phenotype were done using a Leica MS 5 stereomicroscope in room air. Every experiment included controls and at least three biological replicates were performed for each genotype tested. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab (a) Setup for the HCN gas assay: (i) unseeded NGM plate with L4 stage worms and, in a separate plate, aliquots of (ii) hydrochloric acid and (iii) KCN dissolved in sodium hydroxide.

(d) Magnified image of three microfluidic chambers (vii) in which the worms were assayed; each chamber having its individual port (vi) through which the worms and chemical solutions are introduced. Scale bar = 1.5mm.Scoring worm phenotypes. At each time point, animals were scored as being motile, nonmotile, or having limited motility (Fig. 1a). The line denotes the track of the worm body centroid over a period of 22 s. “Motile” worms (Fig. 1a.i) foraged actively on the plates on their own accord, without any need for tapping or prodding with a pick. Worms that showed slight movements of their head and body were scored as having “limited motility” (Fig. 1a.ii). Worms were scored as “nonmotile” (Fig. 1a.iii) if they lay immobile on the plates and did not move despite tapping the plate and prodding with a pick. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Caenorhabditis elegans susceptibility to HCN gas. (a) Worms were scored as being motile, having limited motility or being nonmotile at 30-min time points for a total of 150min of HCN exposure, followed by 2h recovery in room air (number of animals = 60 and number of independent trials = 3). In these photos, the line traces the movement of a representative animal over 22 s. (b) Wild-type N2 animals were rapidly immobilized by HCN gas and did not recover over the span of the assay. (c) egl-9(sa307) mutant animals remained motile in the presence of HCN gas. (d) The egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) double mutants showed a decrease in motility similar to wild type and did not recover. HCN slowed egl-9(ia60) (e) and egl-9(sa330) (f) mutants, but the animals were able to recover motility to a large extent after 2h in room air.RNA Interference Assays RNAi experiments were performed as previously described (Kamath et al., 2000). L4 stage worms were fed either HT115 bacteria with empty vector L4440 (negative control), HT115 bacteria with the vector expressing egl-9 (positive control fed to wild-type worms), or HT115 bacteria with the vector expressing cysl-2 (Shen et al., 2006). Animals were fed the RNAi food for two generations before conducting the experiments.Quantitative Real-Time PCR TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate RNA from synchronized populations of L4 stage worms. The total extracted RNA from each sample was treated with DNase (Promega) and then reverse transcribed into complimentary DNA (cDNA) using Oligo (dT18) primers and AffinityScript reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using SYBR GREEN supermix (Bio-Rad) and each reaction used cDNA from 100ng of total RNA. The primers for K10H10.2 and inf-1 have been previously published (Shen et al., 2005, 2006). Three biological replicates were analyzed for each experiment. Additionally, each PCR reaction was performed in duplicate. The standard curve method was used to analyze the expression levels (Larionov et al., 2005).Microfluidic Assay With Cyanide in Aqueous Solution The setup of the microfluidic assay is illustrated in Figure 2b and it includes a microfluidic chip housing the worms being tested, a stereozoom microscope, and a computer-controlled camera. Fabrication of microfluidic chip. The microfluidic chips were fabricated using a standard soft-lithography process (Carr et al., 2011a,b; Parashar et al., 2011). The device design was drawn in AutoCAD and sent out to an outside vendor (Fineline Imaging) for printing the black-and-white masks. After obtaining the masks from the vendor, a UV-sensitive polymer, SU-8, was spin coated on a 3-in. silicon wafer to create an 80-µm thick layer. The SU-8 was patterned with the features on the physical mask and developed. Then polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer was poured on the SU-8 master and allowed to dry in a low-pressure chamber. The dried PDMS was peeled off the SU-8 master, punched with holes for the fluidic ports, and irreversibly bonded to a standard glass slide (Fig. 2c).System setup and real-time imaging. The microfluidic chip was mechanically secured to the microscope stage using a plastic tape. For the control experiments, Tygon microbore tubing (inner diameter = 0.51mm, outer diameter = 1.52mm) was connected to a syringe and each chamber was filled with a suspension of M9 buffer and E. coli OP50 bacteria through the input port (Fig. 2d). The final concentration of E. coli suspension was maintained at 0.2 OD (optical density). For the cyanide experiments, we used 0.5mM KCN in M9 buffer along with bacterial suspension. For levamisole experiments, we used the drug solutions prepared in M9 buffer at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100µM. Single L4 stage worms were picked using a sterile platinum wire pick and dropped into the input port. A small amount of pressure was applied at the input port to push a single worm into each chamber. Once all three chambers were occupied by three individual worms, images were recorded for a period of 1000 s at the rate of one image per second. The saved videos were analyzed for extraction of the multiple locomotion parameters. To facilitate real-time imaging of worm movement, we used a Leica MZ16 transmission stereozoom microscope that has a wide field of view (to record multiple chambers) and 35-mm working distance (for fluidic handling). The microscope has 1× and 2× objective lenses that enabled 7.1× to 230× range of magnification, which was adequate for the experiments. The microscope was coupled with a QICam 12-bit Mono Fast 1394 cooled digital camera interfacing with QCapture PRO software. This allowed us to capture digital images (1392×1040 pixels) at a specified time interval (typically 1 s). The images from a recorded experiment were appended in sequence and compressed into the Audio Video Interleave (.avi) video format.Data acquisition and analysis. The saved video files were postprocessed by our custom worm tracking program (Carr et al., 2011b; Parashar et al., 2011) that identified moving objects and tracked their location over a period of time. The source code was written in the C++ programming language. The program analyzed a series of images (typically 1000) to identify the body centroid of an individual worm and record the centroid’s changing coordinates over the length of the video. The program was able to track the body centroid for worms moving forward, backward, or having paused for a period of time. The output of the tracking program was a Microsoft Excel workbook with series of x- and y- position coordinates of the body centroid. A custom Graphic User Interface (GUI) program, written in MATLAB, further allowed the user to calculate and plot the locomotion parameters from multiple data files. GraphPad Prism (GraphPad), JMP, and SAS software were used for statistical analyses of the generated data (Sall et al., 2005; SAS Institute, 2011).Results Overactivation of HIF-1 Confers Resistance to HCN Gas Prior studies have shown that egl-9-deficient worms could survive concentrations of HCN gas that killed wild-type worms (Gallagher and Manoil, 2001). In the experiments shown in Figure 1, we monitored the effects of HCN gas on worm motility at 30-min time points for a total of 150min and then examined the abilities of the animals to recover from this. As shown in Figure 1b, wild-type animals were rapidly immobilized in the presence of HCN gas. In contrast, the egl-9-deficient animals (Fig. 1c) were motile even after 2.5h and foraged actively on the plates despite exposure to the toxicant. We hypothesized that the HCN resistance exhibited by egl-9-deficient mutants was due, in whole or in part, to overactivation of HIF-1. To test this, we compared the responses to HCN of egl-9 mutants with those animals that carried loss-of-function mutations in both egl-9 and hif-1. The double mutants were rapidly immobilized in the presence of cyanide gas (Fig. 1d), and this phenotype was very similar to that of hif-1 single mutant animals (Supplementary fig. S1). These results confirmed that the resistance to HCN gas conferred by a loss-of-function mutation in egl-9 was dependent on hif-1 function.Partial Loss-of-Function Mutations in egl-9 Confer Intermediate Resistance Phenotypes Prior genetic studies had isolated and characterized several different mutations in egl-9. Severe loss-of-function mutations, such as egl-9(sa307), had been shown to cause egg-laying defects and dramatic overexpression of numerous HIF-1 targets (Darby et al., 1999; Shao et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2006; Trent et al., 1983). With respect to these phenotypes, the defects conferred by the egl-9(sa330) and egl-9(ia60) mutations have been shown to be less severe (Darby et al., 1999; Shao et al., 2009). We tested the hypothesis that animals carrying the egl-9(sa330) or egl-9(ia60) mutations would have less resistance to HCN gas compared with egl-9(sa307). As seen in Figures 1e and 1f, these less severe mutations resulted in an intermediate resistance phenotype. By 2.5h of exposure to the cyanide gas, these mutants were unable to actively forage on the plates. When left to recover from HCN gas exposure, they soon regained their motility. While observing the phenotypes, we found that there was a subtle difference in the extent and nature of limited motility of the egl-9(ia60) and the egl-9(sa330) alleles but were unable to quantify it readily by manual scoring. These phenotypes demonstrated the need to diagnose behavioral responses to toxicants with higher spatiotemporal resolution. Additionally, we sought to develop technologies that would support the analysis of water-soluble toxicants, including KCN. Accordingly, we designed microfluidic devices coupled to real-time imaging and data analysis platforms. The HCN gas assays in Figure 1 provided a valuable benchmark, as we developed novel and reliable cyanide toxicity assays in microfluidic systems.Design of the Microfluidic Device We proceeded to design a microfluidic chip suitable for assaying small, fast-acting toxicants. Unfortunately, existing devices were not optimal for KCN toxicity studies, so the design of a novel chip proved crucial to our experiments. In prior studies, we had fabricated microfluidic devices to measure the dose-dependent effects of levamisole (an anthelminthic drug) on the movement of C. elegans in real time and at high resolution (Carr et al., 2011b). Even though these devices were later tested with other anthelmintic drugs, they could not be adopted for cyanide assays because of three main obstacles. First, they relied upon an electric field to guide the worms (i.e., electrotaxis), and an electric field would dissociate KCN molecules. In addition, some mutants of interest were not as sensitive to the applied electric fields as the wild-type C. elegans. Initial tests indicated that electrotaxis of egl-9 mutants required electric fields at higher voltage ranges (10–12V) that incapacitate wild-type worms. Second, it was difficult to contain the free-moving worms within the previously constructed microfluidic chamber in the presence of cyanide. We observed that worms responded quickly to KCN solution by trying to escape the chamber, and they explored potential points of exit. In many cases, within a few minutes of cyanide application, worms were found swimming on the liquid surface in the exit ports. Third, agarose was not a suitable medium for observing worm movement, particularly for egl-9 mutants. These mutants frequently paused in agarose-filled microfluidic chambers, sometimes for as long as 20min of observation. We also developed and tested alternate devices with soil-like pillar structures (Lockery et al., 2008), but the egl-9 mutants paused in between the pillars. The custom chip that we designed for this study overcomes these obstacles. It enables the worms to move freely in aqueous solutions but does not allow them to escape. The chip was designed to have nine chambers, wherein three chambers were used simultaneously during an experimental run (Figs. 2c and 2d). The dimensions of the chambers (length = 3.5mm, width = 1.8mm, and height = 80 µm) were chosen to fit the field of view of the microscope under a suitable magnification with sufficient volume to allow for free C. elegans swimming while also maintaining the animals in a single plane of focus. Each chamber, in turn, had a one-way input port with a tapered neck (width = 25 µm and height = 80 µm) for sample injection (Fig. 2d). This design allowed us to simply push the worms into the chamber from one side but prevented them from escaping back through the port.Presence of Food as an Essential Factor for Consistent Worm Movement In experiments designed to optimize the conditions for behavioral analyses in microfluidic devices, we determined that bacterial food promoted consistent movement. In the absence of food, the egl-9 mutants had a tendency to rest for long periods of time, resulting in a great variability in centroid velocity (Supplementary fig. S2). This resting behavior was also displayed in other environments that lacked food, including agarose plates or microfluidic chambers filled with agarose gel or PDMS support pillars (data not shown). However, when a suspension of buffer and food was used, the worms moved more consistently (compare Supplementary fig. S2 and Figs. 3b and 3c). This shows that food can be an important variable in microfluidic behavioral studies. In the experiments described herein, we ensured that the animals had ample food. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Effects of cyanide on worm velocity in the microfluidic assay. (a) In this diagram, the red-dotted line denotes the representative path of the body centroid. The velocity was calculated using the worm’s centroid positions [(x 1, y 1) and (x 2, y 2)] at their two successive time instances (t 1 and t 2). (b–f) Average velocity of body centroid in control (blue) and 0.5mM liquid cyanide (red) conditions. In all the plots, the centroid velocity was calculated by taking the average of all instantaneous velocities of all animals (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7).Multiparameter Behavioral Analysis in Aqueous Cyanide Solution To more completely and accurately define the effects of KCN on wild-type and mutant animals, we used real-time imaging of C. elegans in microfluidic chambers to address the following questions: Are the effects of KCN immediate, or do C. elegans slow down over time? What is the range of velocities exhibited by a population in the presence of the toxicant? Do our data support the hypothesis that mutations that protect C. elegans from HCN gas also protect the animals from aqueous KCN? For experiments examining cyanide response phenotypes in microfluidic devices, individual chambers were filled with chemical solutions described in Materials and Methods section and illustrated in Figure 2. Single L4 stage worms were then inserted into the microfluidic chambers, and their movement was recorded for 1000 s. The worm tracking program produced a list of body centroid locations for each animal as a function of time, which provided quantitative information on the resistance phenotypes. Average velocity of body centroid. To assess the effects of cyanide on wild-type and mutant animals, we placed the animals in the microfluidic chamber, tracked movement over time, and calculated the velocity of the body centroid. More precisely, we calculated the ratio of the net distance between two successive points to the net change in time (1 s). An example is shown in Figure 3a, in which a worm located at centroid position (x 1, y 1) at time instance t 1 swam to another centroid position (x 2, y 2) at time instance t 2. The red-dotted line denotes the path of the body centroid, and the centroid velocity v 21 can be expressed by Equation 1: (1) The effects of KCN on wild-type worms were evident from time 0. In Figures 3b–f, the plots provide information on the magnitude of overall average centroid velocity for particular populations at every second. The blue lines represent the control conditions, whereas the red lines show average centroid velocities in the presence of 0.5mM KCN. Notably, the average centroid velocity of wild-type worms did not change markedly over the 1000 s of recording (Fig. 3b). In contrast to the wild-type animals, the egl-9(sa307) mutants showed similar average centroid velocities both in control conditions (122±19 µm/s) and in cyanide solution (127±21 µm/s). Interestingly, in the first few seconds of the assay, the egl-9(sa307) animals moved faster in the presence of KCN compared with controls. As predicted, the KCN resistance phenotype exhibited by egl-9(sa307) mutants was suppressed by a loss-of-function mutation in hif-1 (compare Figs. 3c and 3d). We also assayed two weaker alleles of egl-9. As shown in Figure 3e, the egl-9(ia60) mutants were slowed by KCN, but not to the degree that wild-type worms were. The KCN had relatively little effect on the centroid velocity of egl-9(sa330) animals (Fig. 3f).Total distance covered by the body centroid. To understand the summative consequences of changes in movement over time, we calculated the total distance traveled by each population assayed. Figures 4a–c depict the movement of representative individuals in the microfluidic device. Figure 4d plots the average distance travelled by the worms’ body centroid during 1000 s within the microfluidic chambers. Using two-way ANOVA, we tested the hypothesis that the effect of the toxicant was dependent on the genotype. Under control conditions, the wild-type and egl-9(sa307) mutants roughly covered the same distance (133±33mm), but wild-type animals traveled significantly less distance in the KCN solution (40±13mm, p < 0.0001). The egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) double mutant also showed a significant decrease from 89±42mm in control to 37±7mm in cyanide solution (p < 0.0002). In control conditions, the egl-9(sa330) strain covered the maximum distance, relative to other strains tested. The egl-9(ia60) strain showed a significant decrease in the distance covered upon cyanide exposure (from 145±37mm in control to 90±44mm in cyanide solution, p < 0.0001). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Total distance traveled in the microfluidic chambers. (a–c) Examples of tracks of animals differently affected by the toxicant. (a) Tracks representative of wild-type animals that exhibited periods of limited motility and eventually ceased movement. (b) Tracks representative of the egl-9(ia60) and egl-9(sa330) animals that exhibited periods of limited motility in the presence of the toxicant but did not become immotile. (c) Tracks representative of egl-9(sa307) animals that continued to swim around the chamber throughout the experiment. (d) The average distance travelled by the worms within 1000 s of recording is shown (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7). *p < 0.0002, two-way ANOVA.Do the cyanide-induced decreases in distance traveled reflect a slow-moving worm with uniform velocity or a relatively fast-moving worm that pauses intermittently? Is the answer the same for all individuals in a population? To address these questions, we examined the movement patterns of individual animals (Fig. 5). We also calculated mean velocities for each condition (Fig. 6), and we quantified the times that worms were immotile (Fig. 7). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Behavioral raster plots of the centroid velocities. In our color scheme, white color denotes a maximum velocity of 500 µm/s and black color denotes a minimum velocity of 0 µm/s. Within every raster plot, each individual row corresponds to a distinct animal that is tracked for 1000 s and the color intensity of each pixel corresponds to the animal’s instantaneous velocity (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7). The wild-type and egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) double mutants show a distinctly slower velocity in cyanide solution (as shown by a darker raster) compared with that in control conditions. The egl-9(sa307) mutants had similar velocities in both control and experimental conditions (as shown by a lighter raster).Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Range and distribution of the average centroid velocities. Compared with egl-9(sa307) mutant animals, the other genotypes showed a decrease in their mean velocities when exposed to 0.5mM KCN (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7).Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Number of pauses in the microfluidic chambers. Pauses were counted as time instances (within the entire 1000 s) when the centroid velocity was less than a threshold velocity of 15 µm/s. (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7).Behavioral raster representation of instantaneous centroid velocity. To more fully understand the effects of the toxicant, we examined the range of responses exhibited by individual worms. Figure 5 represents the instantaneous centroid velocities in microfluidic devices as behavioral raster plots. Each row is a collection of pixels, where the color intensity of each pixel reflects the relative instantaneous centroid velocity of an individual worm that is tracked for 1000 s: from light tan indicating high velocity to dark brown indicating no movement. The plots thus provide a very detailed look at the distribution of individual worm velocities. egl-9(sa307) mutant animals showed a lighter raster in both the control and experimental conditions with almost no pauses. Worms with the weaker allele, egl-9(ia60), had a relatively darker raster in the cyanide solution compared with that in control conditions. In some cases, animals paused for long intervals, and this is illustrated by the darkest portions of the raster for individual worms. A few of the wild-type and the egl-9(ia60) mutants were inactive for long intervals. Interestingly, approximately half of the egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) double mutants paused for extended periods in control conditions. This behavior was less evident in the presence of KCN, which suppressed movement in all the wild-type and hif-1-deficient worms assayed. The egl-9(sa330) animals moved quickly and paused infrequently.Range and distribution of average centroid velocity. Recognizing the variable responses of individual animals as illustrated in the raster plots, we interrogated these phenotypes further by calculating the distribution of centroid velocities achieved by each genotype in each condition. This is shown in Figure 6. This range and distribution of velocities is estimated by counting the occurrences of velocity values within intervals of 20 µm/s for all worms tested under control or experimental conditions. In control conditions, the mean velocities for wild-type and egl-9(sa307) animals were 133±19 and 123±19 µm/s, respectively. In cyanide solution, the mean velocity for egl-9(sa307) worms showed no significant change (127±21 µm/s, p > 0.05), whereas the mean velocity for wild-type worms decreased significantly (40±6 µm/s, p < 0.0001). Compared with wild type, the egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) worms exhibited a slightly lower mean velocity in control conditions (89±25 µm/s), but they showed a significant decrease in cyanide solution (37±7 µm/s). Consistent with the raster plots for individual worm velocities (Fig. 5), the egl-9(sa330) animals moved relatively faster than other worm types in control conditions (182±28 µm/s) with a wider range. In cyanide solution, the mean velocity of the egl-9(sa330) animals decreased to 155±23 µm/s. The egl-9(ia60) mutants behaved similar to wild-type animals in control conditions (143±23 µm/s) but did not show a dramatic decrease in mean velocity upon cyanide exposure (90±19 µm/s).Pausing behavior. To further define this behavior, we identified and quantified the instances in which individual worms slowed to velocities in the 0–15 µm/s range. These data are shown as boxplots in Figure 7. To our advantage, the worm tracking program was particularly sensitive in detecting miniscule changes in centroid velocity with a resolution of 7.5 µm/s. After recording the videos, the worm velocities extracted from the software were compared manually. We noticed that a centroid velocity of 15 µm/s corresponded to worms that exhibited only small changes in body posture and were otherwise immotile. Hence, we chose 15 µm/s as the threshold velocity below which animals were recorded as having stopped. Cyanide caused an increased number of stops, relative to control conditions, for the wild-type animals (26 in control and 155 in cyanide) and egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) double mutants (66 in control and 197 in cyanide). By comparison, we found that the cyanide treatment did not cause the egl-9 single mutants to stop as frequently. In some cases, these analyses reveal differences that were not evident from cursory examination of the raster plots. For example, although the mean velocities of egl-9(sa307) mutants and wild-type animals are very similar in control conditions (Fig. 6), the egl-9(sa307) mutants paused more frequently than did wild-type animals in control conditions (Fig. 7).Deciphering the Role of cysl-2 in Cyanide Resistance We next investigated the role of the cysteine synthase-like gene cysl-2 in egl-9-mediated resistance to aqueous KCN. Overexpression of HIF-1 in egl-9 mutants has been shown to cause a marked increase in the expression of cysl-2/K10H10.2 mRNA (Budde and Roth, 2011; Shao et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2005, 2006). Further, during the course of our studies, Budde and Roth (2011) had demonstrated that RNAi-mediated depletion of cysl-2 caused egl-9-deficient animals to become more susceptible to HCN gas. We proposed two testable hypotheses. First, we predicted that RNAi-mediated depletion of cysl-2 would diminish the resistance of egl-9-deficient mutants to KCN in aqueous solution. Second, we hypothesized that there would be a correlation between the levels of cysl-2 mRNA and the cyanide resistance phenotypes in egl-9 mutant animals. In control experiments, we tested the hypothesis that reducing cysl-2 expression would largely suppress resistance to HCN gas in egl-9(sa307) animals; we depleted cysl-2 mRNA by feeding them bacterial food that carried double-stranded cysl-2 RNA (cysl-2 RNAi). The efficacy of the RNAi protocol was validated in parallel experiments (Supplementary fig. S3a). The egl-9(sa307) mutants treated with cysl-2 RNAi (Fig. 8a.ii) slowed down in the presence of HCN gas. By comparison, the egl-9(sa307) mutants fed control RNAi bacteria were resistant to the toxicant (Fig. 8a.i). Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Effects of cysl-2 depletion on cyanide resistance. (a) In the presence of HCN gas, egl-9(sa307) worms treated with control RNAi (i) remain motile, but cysl-2 (RNAi) (ii) suppresses this resistance phenotype (number of animals = 60 and number of independent trials = 3). (b) Average distance travelled in the microfluidic chambers. *p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA. (c) Range and distribution of the average centroid velocities show a decrease in mean velocity for cysl-2 RNAi-treated egl-9(sa307) in 0.5mM KCN compared with control conditions (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7).To examine the role of cysl-2 in KCN toxicity, we performed experiments in the microfluidic device pictured in Figure 2c. We found that depletion of cysl-2 by RNAi increased the sensitivity of egl-9(sa307) mutant animals to the toxicant. This was evidenced by a significant decrease in average distance traveled (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA; Fig. 8b) and reduced average centroid velocity (Supplementary fig. S3b). The cysl-2 RNAi did not have marked effects on the mean velocity of the egl-9(sa307) animals in control conditions, but toxicant exposure caused a decrease in mean velocity (Fig. 8c). The raster plots illustrate that these phenotypes were relatively consistent: cysl-2 RNAi caused egl-9(sa307) animals to slow appreciably in the presence of KCN (Supplementary fig. S3c). To test the hypothesis that there would be a correlation between the levels of cysl-2 mRNA and the cyanide resistance phenotypes in egl-9 mutant animals, we performed quantitative real-time PCR and assessed the levels of cysl-2 expression in egl-9(sa307), egl-9(sa330), and egl-9(ia60) mutant animals (three biological replicates for each). We found that the expression level of cysl-2 mRNA was 11-fold higher in egl-9(sa307) strong loss-of-function mutants compared with the egl-9(ia60) and egl-9(sa330) mutants (Supplementary table 1). Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the strong cyanide resistance phenotype in egl-9(sa307) mutant animals is due to higher levels of cysl-2 expression compared with the egl-9(sa330) and egl-9(ia60) mutants, which show comparatively reduced resistance.Robustness of the Assay and Device Testing for Broader Applications We investigated whether these assays could be adapted for increased throughput, as this might also broaden its applicability. Higher throughput might be accomplished most readily by increasing the number of animals in each chamber or by shortening the time of assay. We determined that inserting multiple worms (up to three) inside individual microfluidic chambers did not markedly change the cyanide resistance phenotype (Fig. 9). We measured the average centroid velocities of wild-type and egl-9(sa307) worms in control and experimental conditions. Tests were conducted by using one, two, or three worms within individual microfluidic chambers. In each set of experiments, KCN caused a significant decrease in the velocity of wild-type worms in each case (Fig. 9, p < 0.0001). This indicates that the microfluidic assay is not limited to testing a single worm per chamber but can be scaled-up for multiple worms (up to three) per chamber without losing resolution. Furthermore, we noticed that the duration of the microfluidic experiment could be shortened without losing crucial information. In other words, even though our microfluidic experiments were recorded for 1000 s, the required behavioral information could be obtained from experiments recorded for the first 300 s. As an example, the percentage reduction in average centroid velocity for worms in cyanide solution was roughly maintained throughout the experimental duration of 1000 s (Fig. 3b). Our calculations show that, for wild-type worms, the percentage reduction in average centroid velocity caused by cyanide exposure was approximately 30%, whether it was measured over 300, 600, or 900 s. This threefold decrease in experimental time will be particularly useful in further improving the efficiency of the microfluidic assay. Fig. 9. Open in a new tab Scaling-up the microfluidic technique with multiple worms in individual chambers. (a–c) Snapshots of the microfluidic chamber housing one, two, or three worms (number of animals = 12 and number of independent trials = 3). (d) Average centroid velocities of single or multiple wild-type worms in a microfluidic chamber are plotted under control conditions and 0.5mM KCN. In each of the three cases (with one, two, or three worms), there was a significant reduction in the centroid velocity upon exposure to cyanide solution (*p < 0.0001). (e) Average centroid velocities of single or multiple egl-9(sa307) worms. The number of worms in the chamber had no significant difference on the average velocity measured in each condition (p > 0.05).We designed the microfluidic chamber with the idea that it could be applicable to other water-soluble toxicants that cause acute changes in mobility, potentially inducing genotoxins, heavy metals, environmental toxicants, pharmacological products, and xenobiotics. To test this principle, we used the assay, coupled with real-time imaging, to analyze the effects of the anthelminthic drug levamisole on wild-type worm motility. As seen in Figure 10, the total distance covered by the worms steadily decreased with an increase in the concentration of the drug. Fig. 10. Open in a new tab Applicability of the microfluidic device. The distance covered by wild-type worms decreased as the concentration of the anthelminthic drug levamisole increased from 0µM (control) to 100µM (number of animals = 12 and number of independent trials = 3).DISCUSSION Overactivation of HIF-1, via loss-of-function mutations in egl-9, has been shown to impact C. elegans longevity and stress resistance (Powell-Coffman, 2010). We were particularly interested in investigating how a loss-of-function mutation in egl-9 and the accompanying overactivation of HIF-1 could protect C. elegans from cyanide toxicity. In this article, we have presented a novel microfluidics-based approach to study the responses of C. elegans to this toxicant. Through the HCN gas exposure assays, we confirmed that the resistance of egl-9(sa307) strong loss-of-function worms was dependent on hif-1 function, and we investigated the HCN resistance phenotypes of other mutant alleles of egl-9. Compared with the egl-9(sa307) mutation, the ia60 and sa330 alleles cause less severe egg-laying defects (Darby et al., 1999; Shao et al., 2009). Here, we report a correlation between cysl-2 mRNA expression and cyanide resistance phenotypes in these egl-9 mutants. Detailed analyses of intermediate phenotypes such as those exhibited by the egl-9(ia60) and egl-9(sa330) strains can be very informative to understanding the genetic bases of cyanide response and resistance. Real-time imaging technologies enrich phenotypic analyses by providing quantitative data on worm behavior and velocity for every second of analysis. Microfluidics offered the opportunity to quantitate the responses to aqueous toxicants with superior spatiotemporal resolution, in a single and continuous plane of focus, at the individual worm level and in a much shorter period of time. We established that the genotypes that were resistant to HCN gas were also resistant to aqueous KCN in the microfluidic device. We investigated multiple parameters, including the average velocity of the body centroid, total distance covered by the worms, behavioral raster representation of individual animals, range and distribution of mean velocities, and pausing behavior and stops. Collectively, these data provide a rich and detailed analysis of the cyanide resistance phenotypes and of the roles of egl-9, hif-1, and cysl-2. Higher Spatiotemporal Resolution in Microfluidic Assay Prior studies have demonstrated the efficacy of microfluidic devices for C. elegans analyses, such as force sensor arrays (Doll et al., 2009), mazes (Pandey et al., 2011; Qin and Wheeler, 2007), microtraps (Hulme, 2007; Lockery, 2007), fluorescent sorters (Chronis et al., 2007; Chung et al., 2008), electrotaxis sorters (Manière et al., 2011; Rezai et al., 2012), and olfactory assays (Chronis et al., 2007), and recent review articles summarize the key developments in microfluidic worm chips (Buckingham and Sattelle, 2008; Chronis et al., 2007; Crane et al., 2010; Dittrich and Manz, 2006). The combination of microfluidics and automated imaging increases the power of C. elegans as a genetic model system to study the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time. A major contribution of our work is the development of a liquid-based microfluidic assay coupled to imaging technologies to quantify the toxicant response phenotypes of C. elegans. The discrete scoring of worm motility was further quantified by specific movement parameters generated by our computer program after real-time imaging (summarized in Supplementary fig. S4). The need for a real-time analysis system with increased resolution is particularly acute when analyzing subtle phenotypic differences among genotypes of interest. Mutants with strong cyanide resistance phenotypes [such as egl-9(sa307)] show markedly distinct movement patterns under cyanide exposure compared with the wild-type worms. This behavior is easy to detect and score manually in gas-based assays (Fig. 2). However, differences between mutants with weaker cyanide resistance [such as egl-9(ia60)] are difficult to score manually, especially when they have a range of decreased velocities or pause for extended times. The microfluidic assay provided much higher spatiotemporal resolution, as we were able to record the x and y coordinates (Fig. 3) of each individual worm at every second of the assay time span. The average velocity of the worm populations (Fig. 3) showed that the effects of KCN were quick, and the drop in velocity was then consistent for the time span we tested. The total distance covered by the worms (Fig. 4) gave an overview of the cumulative effects of the toxicant on worm movement. Interestingly, the behavioral raster representation of individual worms showed some surprising insights into worm behavior during exposure to the toxicant. The real-time imaging and worm tracking program allow us to detect velocities as low as 7.5 µm/s and number of pauses as small as 20–50, which cannot be recorded via a manual scoring technique. Using these technologies, we discovered important features of specific strains and their responses to cyanide. Of particular interest: (1) the egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04) double mutant strain had lower overall velocity in control conditions compared with the wild-type strains. Our data show that this difference was largely attributable to more frequent pausing (Figs. 5 and 7). (2) In control conditions, the egl-9(sa330) mutant worms moved a greater distance during the course of the experiment. This was due to both higher mean velocity (Fig. 6) and less pausing (Fig. 7). (3) In both the HCN gas assays and the KCN toxicity experiments, the egl-9(ia60) strain was more affected by the toxicants, relative to the el-9(sa330) strain. As shown in Figs. 5 and 7, the egl-9(sa330) mutants did not pause more frequently in response to KCN, and although the mean velocity was lower in KCN (Fig. 6), the summative effects on total distance were relatively small (Fig. 4).Genetics of Cyanide Resistance in C. elegans Overactivation of HIF-1 has been shown to dramatically increase expression levels of the cysteine synthase cysl-2 gene (Shao et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2006). Budde and Roth demonstrated that cysl-2-deficient animals exhibited increased sensitivity to HCN. Further, they proposed that CYSL-2 catalyzes the first step of a metabolic pathway that detoxifies HCN (Budde and Roth, 2011). This suggested a model in which loss of egl-9 function increases HIF-1 activity, which in turn increases cysl-2 expression and protects C. elegans from cyanide. Here, we tested specific predictions made by this model. First, we asked whether depletion of cysl-2 was sufficient to suppress the egl-9(sa307) cyanide resistance phenotype, assayed in gas chambers or in liquid. As shown in Figure 8, depletion of cysl-2 by RNA interference dramatically decreased the resistance of egl-9(sa307) animals to cyanide. The microfluidic technologies coupled to real-time imaging provided quantitative descriptions of these phenotypes. The egl-9(sa307) animals treated with cysl-2 RNAi exhibited decreased average centroid velocity and distance travelled compared with control RNAi treatments. Additionally, we found that the levels of the cysl-2 cysteine synthase mRNA were much higher in the egl-9(sa307) mutant animals compared with the egl-9(ia60) and egl-9(sa330) mutants (Supplementary table 1). This correlates well with the variation we observed in the cyanide resistance phenotype in these strains. Although these data clearly show that cysl-2 has a central role in cyanide resistance, we postulate that other HIF-1 targets also contribute to the ability of egl-9 mutants to survive in the presence of this toxicant.CONCLUSIONS Here, we developed new microfluidic technologies to examine the genetic underpinnings of cyanide resistance. The HCN gas exposure assay validated the microfluidic assay, and both provided insights to the phenotypes and reinforced central conclusions. Prior studies had shown that mutations in egl-9 protected C. elegans from cyanide. Here, we show that this resistance phenotype is dependent on the HIF-1 transcription factor. Further, the expression of cysl-2 in each mutant correlates with the degree of cyanide resistance. This was further assayed by multiparameter analyses of worm motility, which described these phenotypes in much greater detail. The combination of C. elegans genetics and the microfluidics-enabled approaches and technologies developed here can be used to address many toxicological and biological questions. HIF-1 in particular has been shown to have roles in the responses to diverse stresses and toxicants (Powell-Coffman, 2010), and in future studies, we will employ these and related technologies to elucidate the functions of HIF-1 and interacting genes. The combination of real-time imaging, microfluidic technologies, and C. elegans genetics hold great promise for the study of water-soluble toxicants. The authors will provide the fabricated microfluidic chips and the worm tracking software to interested parties. A standard desktop computer with Windows 7 or a higher operating system and a light or stereozoom microscope with an attached camera will be needed for running the experiments.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Martian regolith (unconsolidated surface material) is a potential medium for plant growth in bioregenerative life support systems during manned missions on Mars. However, hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels in the regolith of Mars can reach as high as 10 wt%, and would be expected to be highly inhibitory to plant growth.Methodology and Principal Findings Disabling ion transporters AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2, which are plasma membrane localized in peripheral root cells, is not an effective way to confer tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils. Arabidopsis mrs2-10 and sel1-10 knockout lines do not mitigate the growth inhibiting impacts of high MgSO4·7H2O concentrations observed with wildtype plants. A global approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to high MgSO4·7H2O (magnesium sulfate) stress. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in Col-0, and also between Col-0 and the mutant line cax1-1, which was confirmed to be relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO4·7H2O in soil solution. Differentially expressed genes in Col-0 treated for 45 min. encode enzymes primarily involved in hormone metabolism, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, kinases, cell wall related proteins and membrane-based transporters. Over 200 genes encoding transporters were differentially expressed in Col-0 up to 180 min. of exposure, and one of the first down-regulated genes was CAX1. The importance of this early response in wildtype Arabidopsis is exemplified in the fact that only four transcripts were differentially expressed between Col-0 and cax1-1 at 180 min. after initiation of treatment.Conclusions/Significance The results provide a solid basis for the understanding of the metabolic response of plants to elevated magnesium sulfate soils; it is the first transcriptome analysis of plants in this environment. The results foster the development of Mars soil-compatible plants by showing that cax1 mutants exhibit partial tolerance to magnesium sulfate, and by elucidating a small subset (500 vs. >10,000) of candidate genes for mutation or metabolic engineering that will enhance tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Long duration human missions to Mars must rely on more than just stored supplies and physico-chemical means to regenerate air and clean water. The Advanced Life Support (ALS) scenarios envisioned for extended manned missions will depend upon the efficient use of local planetary resources and the recycling of limited materials such as water, pressurized atmosphere, and organic matter, while producing food to augment supplies [1]. The use of in situ regolith for plant growth in a future bioregenerative life support system on Mars may have several advantages over hydroponic systems [2], [3]. These include the immediate bioavailability of plant essential ions, low-tech mechanical support for plants, and easy access to in situ materials once on the surface. However, plant growth may be reduced or inhibited by phytotoxic substances in the regolith, such as high levels of soluble magnesium sulfate minerals. Hydrated forms of magnesium sulfate such as MgSO4·7H2O (epsomite) and MgSO4·H2O (kieserite) have been detected in several regions by the Mars Express Satellite [4], [5], [6]. Analyses by the Mars Exploration Rover landers at Meridiani Planum and Gusev crater have also indicated the presence of high levels of magnesium sulfate minerals (up to 10 wt%) in outcrops and soils [7], [8], [9]. High levels of hydrated sulfate minerals in regolith on Mars used in bioregenerative life support systems will lead to exposure of plant roots to supra-optimal concentrations of both Mg2+ and SO4 2− ions in the soil solution. Plants may have evolved to cope with relatively high levels of elements in the soil environment by limiting internal accumulation or tolerating high internal concentrations [10]. In a potential bioregenerative life support system on Mars, an excess of a particular element in the crew's diet could affect the availability of other required elements. This study therefore first determined whether knockout mutant lines for genes encoding certain transporters responsible for uptake of Mg2+ and SO4 2− ions in roots could enhance plant tolerance to high levels of magnesium sulfate in the growth medium and then moved to a molecular analysis of the responses to Mg2+ and SO4 2− in order to increase the potential pool of candidate genes. Various efforts have previously illustrated that the disabling of transporter genes can indeed improve tolerance to certain elements. For example, a line of transgenic wheat plants expressing an antisense construct of the high affinity K+ transporter TaHKT2;1 showed reduced sodium uptake by roots and enhanced growth relative to unstressed plants compared to a control line at high levels of NaCl in the growth medium [11]. Several plasma membrane localized proteins in the outer cell layers of Arabidopsis roots are known to be responsible for magnesium or sulfate ion uptake. Two specific genes, AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2, were chosen for this study, in part because of their localization and because of availability of knockout lines. AtMRS2-10 ( = AtMGT1) functionally complemented a bacterial mutant lacking Mg2+ transport capability and AtMRS2-10-GFP–expressing plants showed fluorescence in the periphery of root cells, suggesting a plasma membrane association [12]. AtMRS2-10 is, to date, the only member of the AtMRS2 family that is known to be associated to the plasma membrane of root cells in addition to having Mg2+ ion transport capability. Therefore, a knockout mutant line of the AtMRS2-10 gene (mrs 2-10) was characterized for this study based on the SALK_100361.41.30.x T-DNA insertion line [13]. AtSULTR1;2 is a constitutively expressed sulfate transporter gene whose product AtSULTR1;2 is localized in root hair, epidermal and cortical cells where it ensures sulfate uptake into plants under sulfur-replete conditions [14]. A knockout mutant line of the AtSULTR1;2 gene (sel1-10) was shown to take up 80% less sulfate than wildtype when grown for 12 days on agar with optimal levels (1.7 mM MgSO4·7H2O) of sulfate [15]. Knockout lines of genes encoding vacuolar H+/Ca2+ transporters CAX1 and CAX3 were also analyzed to present perspective of other, non-plasma membrane, cellular transporter locations. The cax1-1 and cax1/cax3 lines were previously shown to be more tolerant of high Mg2+ levels in the form of MgCl2 when grown on agar [16], [17]. In a separate study, a CAX1 knockout mutant was identified through a mutant screen on nutrient solutions reflecting low Ca∶Mg ratios characteristic of serpentine soils [18]. When high MgSO4·7H2O concentrations are applied, the Ca∶Mg ratio of the nutrient solution decreases, which therefore makes the cax1-1 and cax1/cax3 mutants candidates for high magnesium sulfate tolerance. This study determined whether enhanced tolerance to low Ca∶Mg ratios is maintained when cax1-1 and cax1/cax3 mutants are exposed to elevated SO4 2− in addition to elevated Mg2+ in soil medium. These candidate genes for enhanced magnesium sulfate tolerance that are presented above were selected based on previous literature describing the results of individual gene or gene family analyses. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses of plants exposed to elevated concentrations of magnesium, sulfate, or magnesium sulfate in the growth medium have not been reported to date. In order to increase the number of candidate genes that could play a role in enhancing growth performance of plants exposed to this abiotic stress, root transcriptome remodeling in Col-0 was analyzed after short-term (45 min.) hydroponic exposure to a non-lethal, high concentration of MgSO4·7H2O. This early time point was chosen to capture part of the primary stress responses. The differential expression of transporter genes was analyzed after 90 min. and 180 min. in addition to 45 min., as this group in particular may represent a metabolic strategy for tolerance to an elevated magnesium sulfate environment. The root transcriptome of the transporter gene knockout mutant cax1-1 was furthermore contrasted with that of Col-0 after both genotypes were exposed to MgSO4·7H2O treatment for 180 min. Based on their previously identified tolerance to high MgCl2 and low Ca∶Mg ratios, cax1 mutants are likely to show enhanced growth compared to wildtype when exposed to high magnesium sulfate levels. Furthermore, ionome analyses of cax1 mutants showed that they have significantly reduced levels of Mg2+ in their leaves compared to wildtype [18].The cax1/cax3 double knockout mutant, while having the potential to show tolerance to elevated MgSO4·7H2O based on its tolerance to MgCl2 and its reduced shoot levels of Mg2+, showed significant differences in concentration of multiple elements, and grew more slowly than wildtype under regular nutrient conditions [17]. Since cax1-1 mutants did not display negative effects on growth under regular nutrient conditions, cax1-1 rather than cax1/cax3 was included in the root transcriptome analysis. Genes differentially regulated between cax1-1 and Col-0 grown under stress conditions could reveal those molecular processes possibly leading to significant differences in growth performance at the whole plant level. A hydroponic medium was chosen to mimic root exposure to a specific soil solution in order to directly link transcriptome responses to the level of bioavailable ions that roots may experience in a hypothetical root zone of a regolith profile on Mars [19]. The treatment concentration of MgSO4·7H2O was based on the low Ca∶Mg ratio that can occur in serpentine soils on Earth. Because of their high amount of bioavailable magnesium, Serpentine soils can be seen as a partial analogue for regolith high in magnesium sulfate on Mars [20].",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Mrs2-10 T-DNA Insertion Line Characterization A homozygous knockout T-DNA insertion line for AtMRS2-10 (At1g80900) was identified by PCR and RT-PCR using the original SALK_100361.41.30.x line (Fig. 1a,b). For PCR, oligonucleotide primers MRS2-10_LP (5′-CAGGATCAAAGCATCGTTCTC-3′) and MRS2-10_RP (5′-TAGGAGCTCAGAAGACGCAAC-3′) were designed using software available on the Salk Institute website (http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.html). In addition, the T-DNA specific primer LBb1 (5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3′) was included as designed and recommended by the Salk Institute. Combinations of the primers were used to identify plants for which the T-DNA insertion was present in both AtMRS2-10 alleles. Genomic DNA was extracted from T-DNA insertion mutant leaves using the Shorty method. For this method, 500 uL Shorty Buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCL pH 9.0, 0.4 M LiCl, 25 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS) was added to ground leaf tissue (∼0.25 cm2) in a microcentrifuge tube. The tube was then spun for 5 min. at high speed in a microcentrifuge. Supernatant (350 uL) was transferred to a new tube containing isopropanol (350 uL). The two volumes were mixed by inversion and the tube was spun for 10 min. at top speed in a microcentrifuge. After this, the liquid was discarded and the pellet was air-dried before being resuspended in 100 uL TE buffer. Genomic DNA was extracted from Col-0 leaves using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). PCR was carried out using JumpStart Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma). PCR products were separated in agarose gels and stained with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen). A confirmed homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant was backcrossed to Col-0 three times before allowing self-fertilization. Homozygous plants backcrossed 3× were identified by PCR and used for seed generation. For RT-PCR, RNA was extracted from leaves of Col-0 and a homozygous T-DNA insertion line for AtMRS2-10 (At80900) with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Gene specific oligonucleotide primers MRS2-10_LP1 (5′-AGGGTTACTTTGTCGGAGA-3′) and MRS2-10_RP1 (5′-TACACGGGGTTTTATCTTG-3′) were designed based on Arabidopsis genomic DNA sequence information (). Alpha-(α)-Tubulin was used as a constitutive control with primers according to Yoshimoto (2002). RT-PCR was carried out using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). PCR products were separated in agarose gels and stained with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen). An ionome analysis of the backcrossed homozygous AtMRS2-10 knockout mutants (mrs2-10) was performed as part of the Purdue Ionomics project and results are available online through the Purdue Ionomics Information Management System (http://www.ionomicshub.org/home/PiiMS) [21]. Figure 1. Homozygous knockout mutant line mrs2-10. Open in a new tab (a) A homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant for AtMRS2-10 (At1g80900) was identified by PCR based on the SALK_100361.41.30.x line. (b) RNA extracted from mrs2-10 and Col-0 leaves was tested for the presence of MRS2-10 mRNA with gene-specific primers. Alpha-(α)-Tubulin (TUB) was used as a constitutive control. Plant Growth Experiments on Soil Medium Seeds from the Ws, Col-0, mrs2-10, sel1-10 [15], cax1-1 [16] and cax1/cax3 [17] lines were sterilized by soaking them for 15 minutes in a 40% (v/v) bleach solution with a drop of Tween 20 (polyoxyethylenesorbitanmonolaureate). The seeds were then washed six times with sterilized (autoclaved) water. To control for environmental variation when comparing plant growth per concentration, each tray was divided in 8 sections of 6 wells each, with either a mutant line or its associated wildtype background line planted in one section, in alternating fashion. This method resulted in 4 sections per seed line per tray. The seeds were evenly planted (5 seeds per tray well) on the soil medium (sphagnum peat moss, vermiculite and perlite) that was wetted with nutrient solution. The basic and control nutrient solution consisted of 2.2 g/L Murashige and Skoog salts (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 g/L MES buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). For the treatments, MgSO4·7H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the basic solution at 20, 60, 80 or 100 mM concentration. The pH of the solutions was adjusted to 5.70–5.75 with KOH. The trays with soil were covered with plastic wrap to maintain sufficient humidity and placed in a cold room at 4°C for three days. After stratification, the trays were moved to a growth room at 23°C where they were randomly placed on the growth benches. There, the seeds germinated, the plastic wrap was removed after 3–5 days, and the surviving plants were thinned to two plants per well (maximum of 12 plants per section) after one week to maintain sufficient spacing. The plants were sub-irrigated twice a week, alternatively with tap water and the appropriate nutrient solution. The plants were analyzed at week 4 and the experiment was repeated three times. Growth Performance Measurements and Statistical Analysis Fresh weight biomass of plants grown on soil was measured by grouping and weighing whole shoots of plants per tray section. Leaf chlorophyll content of plants grown on soil medium was measured with a Minolta SPAD-502 meter. One leaf measurement per plant per tray well was taken. Biomass or chlorophyll levels of wildtype and knockout mutant Arabidopsis lines were evaluated in a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) model using SAS 9.2 and JMP Genomics 7 software. Genotype and concentration were included in the ANOVA model as fixed effects, while batch (replication set) was included as a random effect. Unbiased estimates of biomass or chlorophyll levels (least-square means) were generated for each effect (genotype, concentration, or genotype and concentration) per experiment. The estimated levels of biomass or chlorophyll were then compared using a series of t-tests, generating estimated differences and corresponding p-values. Differences with associated p-values<0.05 were considered significant. Results of the ANOVA analysis are presented in Table S1. Hydroponic Root Growth The hydroponic set-up for Arabidopsis that was used in this study is based on two previously described systems [22], [23]. Glass containers (2.6 L) were covered with opaque black plastic sheeting along the glass, and with opaque plastic lids across the top. In each opaque plastic lid, 18 holes (d = 1.43 cm) were made at regular intervals with a hole puncher. A 2-cm-long Rockwool (Grodan) plug (d = 1.59 cm) was placed in each hole. Containers were filled with a nutrient solution adjusted to pH 5.7 by KOH that was replaced once a week. It consisted of distilled water, 0.25 g/L MES buffer, and 1/32x MS salts during week 1 and 2, while the concentration of MS salts increased to 1/16x during week 3. Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and stratified before planting about ten seeds per Rockwool plug. Col-0 seeds were planted on 18 containers while cax1-1 seeds were planted on 6. Containers were covered with transparent plastic wrap during the first 3–5 days of germination. Holes were made in the plastic wrap after 1–3 days depending on the general atmospheric humidity. The containers were randomly placed over 3 benches (8 containers/bench). Air was supplied to the roots by one 3W air pump per 8 containers; each container had an airstone made from glass beads. After one week, seedlings were thinned to one seedling per Rockwool plug, so that every container supported 18 plants (Fig. 2a). At day 21, Col-0 and cax1-1 roots were exposed to the basic nutrient solution (0.25 g/L MES, 1/16x MS, pH 5.7) with an additional 2.08 mM magnesium sulfate (total Ca∶Mg ratio = 1∶15). Col-0 was exposed for 45 min., 90 min., or 180 min., while cax1-1 was exposed for 180 min. only. The Col-0 control set received no extra magnesium sulfate and was harvested at 45 min. together with the first Col-0 treatment set. Four replicate containers were harvested for the control and each of the treatment sets (Fig. 2b). Roots were cut below the Rockwool plug and pooled per container before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Figure 2. Overview of hydroponic Arabidopsis growth and root harvest. Open in a new tab (a) Set-up for the microarray experiment. (b) Example of Arabidopsis roots after 21 days of growth, and of root harvest per container for the microarray and Q-PCR experiments. Microarray Procedures, Statistical Analysis and Data display RNA was extracted from root samples with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Samples were weighed while still frozen and reagents were adjusted to the total measured weight for the grinding and lysing step. Two replicate extractions were completed per sample with lysate volumes corresponding to 100 mg frozen wet weight each. The remainder of a sample was stored at −80°C as cleared lysate according to the Qiagen protocol. The quality and quantity of the extracted RNA was checked with denaturing agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and the NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). RNA from each sample was amplified and labeled with cy3 dye by using Agilent Quick Amp labeling kit, one color. A total of 20 samples were hybridized to five 4×44k Arabidopsis microarray slides (Agilent), which were then washed and scanned before data was extracted. Microarray handling and data extraction was done at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) at the University of Florida according to the One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis (Quick Amp Labeling) Protocol (version 5.7). Median signal intensities were quantile normalized using R software. Log2 transformed normalized data were evaluated using a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) model [24], [25] implemented in SAS 9.2 that included the fixed effect of each genotype and time of tissue harvest. Unbiased, least square means estimates of transcript abundance were generated and gene expression measured in each treatment was then compared to a control using a series of t-tests; Col-0 sets treated for 45 min., 90 min., or 180 min were compared to the Col-0 set exposed to a control solution for 45 min., and these three comparisons are referred to in the text, tables and figures as Time 45, Time 90, and Time 180 respectively (Fig. 3). In addition, the cax1-1 set treated for 180 min. was compared to the Col-0 set treated for 180 min. (Fig. 3). The p-values generated in these comparisons were corrected for multiple testing by controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) with the Q-value procedure in the Q-value 1.0 package (default settings) of the R software [26]. A default q-value threshold of 0.05 was used to declare a significant difference in gene expression between treatment and control. The results of the ANOVA analysis are presented in Table S2. Lists of genes with statistically significant changes in expression were further organized, analyzed and displayed in tables and figures using JMP Genomics 7, R software, GeneVenn, GOstat, Cluster 3.0, Java TreeView 1.1.4r5, the  () BLAST tool, and the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) Motif analysis tool. Figure 3. Overview of the microarray experiment. Open in a new tab The experiment included 20 arrays in total, each with a single cy3-labeled sample hybridized to it. Each sample set consisted of 4 biological replicates. Gene expression was compared among the sets as indicated by the arrows; Col-0 sets treated for 45 min., 90 min., or 180 min. were compared to the Col-0 set exposed to a control solution for 45 min., and these three comparisons are referred to in the text, tables and figures as Time 45, Time 90, and Time 180 respectively. The comparison of cax1-1 with Col-0 treated for 180 min. is not referred to in abbreviated form. Quantitative Real-time PCR Wildtype Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were grown hydroponically for 21 days as described above. At day 21, four containers received a replacement of the basic nutrient solution (0.25 g/L MES, 1/16x MS, pH5.7), while another four containers received the basic solution with an additional 2.08 mM magnesium sulfate (total Ca∶Mg ratio = 1∶15). Roots of treatment and control plants were exposed for 180 min. before being harvested per container. RNA was extracted and checked for quality and quantity as described above. RNA from these independently grown plants exposed or unexposed for 180 min., as well as RNA from plants exposed for 180 min. and unexposed for 45 min. in the microarray experiment, were used for the quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analyses. Q-PCR was performed using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). 1 ug of total RNA was reverse transcribed per sample for a total of three control and three treatment samples. Primers were designed for 5 genes using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) (Table 1). At2g32170 was chosen as a stably expressing reference gene appropriate for abiotic stress treatment [27]. Each template/primer pair combination was run in triplicate. The relative increase or decrease of mRNA abundance between the two sample sets was calculated by using the Pfaffl method, and statistical analysis of the results was done with the REST 2008 2.0.7 software.

    "results": "Results Plant Growth Performance The growth performance of transporter gene knockout mutant lines and their respective wildtype backgrounds grown for four weeks on soil treated with MgSO4·7H2O in solution (0–100 mM) was compared on the basis of shoot fresh weight (FW) biomass and leaf chlorophyll levels. Figure 4 shows the growth habit of mrs2-10 and sel1-10 plants compared to wildtype in the left hand panels, and of cax1-1 and cax1/cax3 compared to wildtype in the right-hand panels. Statistical analysis of the FW shoot biomass of wildtype Arabidopsis (Ws, Col-0) with ANOVA confirmed the significant phytotoxic effects of increasing concentrations of dissolved MgSO4·7H2O on wildtype plant growth (Table S1). Subsequent ANOVA analyses assessed whether selected mutant lines could alleviate the growth-limiting effects seen in wildtype. Results showed that FW shoot biomass and leaf chlorophyll content of mrs2-10 and sel1-10 lines were indistinguishable from that of wildtype at the tested concentrations (Fig. 5a–d, Table S1). Ionome analysis of the mrs2-10 mutant exposed to regular nutrient conditions furthermore did not reveal a statistically different leaf Mg content compared to Col-0 (http://www.ionomicshub.org/home/PiiMS). Although there was little difference between the mrs2-10 and sel1-10 lines and their respective wild-type backgrounds, the cax1-1 and cax1/cax3 lines showed relative improvement in their ability to grow on MgSO4·7H2O enriched soil. Cax1-1 plants had significantly higher FW shoot biomass and leaf chlorophyll content than Col-0 grown at 80 and 100 mM MgSO4·7H2O (Fig. 5e,g, Table S1). The increase in cax1-1 shoot biomass over that of Col-0 was 89% and 149% at 80 and 100 mM respectively. The CAX1 knockout mutation did not fully eliminate the effects of high magnesium sulfate on plant growth performance; the absolute FW shoot biomass of cax1-1 grown on soil for four weeks was still low (20%) compared to untreated Col-0 (Fig 5e). Cax1/cax3 plants showed significantly higher leaf chlorophyll content than Col-0 grown at 80, and 100 mM, but the average FW shoot biomass increases of 26.8% and 33.2%, at 80 and 100 mM, were not found to be statistically significant (Fig. 5f,h, Table S1). The significant differences in FW shoot biomass and leaf chlorophyll content between cax1/cax3 and Col-0 grown at 0 mM MgSO4·7H2O were described in detail by Cheng et al. (2005). In this study, 0 mM was only included as a point of reference for the high concentrations of MgSO4·7H2O. Figure 4. Overview of the Arabidopsis growth experiment on soil. Open in a new tab Mutant lines are grown alongside their respective wildtype backgrounds on trays containing soil medium with different levels of dissolved MgSO4·7H2O. To control for environmental variation, each tray was divided in 8 sections, with a mutant line and its associated wildtype background line planted in alternating fashion. Yellow boxes highlight the sections with mutant plants within each flat; the other sections contain wildtype plants. For the comparison between cax1/cax3 and Col-0, 60 mM was not tested. The plants shown here are 3 weeks old and were harvested and analyzed after completing 4 weeks of growth. The experiment was repeated three times.Figure 5.

Root Transcriptome Root transcriptome remodeling was analyzed in Arabidopsis after hydroponic exposure to a non-lethal, high concentration of MgSO4·7H2O (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Table S2). The number of genes with statistically significant differences in expression between Col-0 exposed to MgSO4·7H2O and Col-0 exposed to control conditions increased from 325 (Time 45) to 1516 (Time 90) and 3265 (Time 180) (Fig. 6). The number of genes with a significant difference in expression of over 2-fold increased accordingly, from 100 to 248 and 445. Between cax1-1 and Col-0 exposed to MgSO4·7H2O for 180 min., only 4 unique transcripts showed a significant difference in expression, and all were over a 2-fold change in abundance (Fig. 6).

Primary MgSO4·7H2O stress response The primary root transcriptome responses to MgSO4·7H2O stress were analyzed in Col-0 treated for 45 min. versus Col-0 treated with a control solution for 45 min. (Time 45) to reveal genes involved in the metabolic response to this environment as candidate genes that could play a role in high magnesium sulfate tolerance. The resulting set of 325 genes with significant differences in expression was analyzed for over- and under-represented GO molecular function categories. Significantly over-represented categories were polygalacturonase activity, calcium ion binding, and transcription factor activity (Table 2). Many of the transcripts represented at Time 45 encode phytohormone associated proteins, transcription factors, Ca2+-binding proteins, kinases, phosphatases, disease resistance proteins, cell wall related proteins, membrane-based transporters, as well as proteins of unknown functional category. The better characterized of these genes are listed by category in Table 3. For example, phytohormone associated genes encoding enzymes involved in ABA (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase), ethylene (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase) and jasmonic acid (lipoxygenase ) biosynthesis pathways show up-regulated expression. The gene encoding C2H2 type zinc finger family transcription factor ZAT7 is up-regulated, while the gene encoding transcription factor WRKY70 is down-regulated at Time 45. The expression of the gene encoding CBL-interacting protein kinase CIPK9 is up-regulated. Genes encoding cell-wall and disease-resistance associated proteins are also well represented; fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (RHD1), xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XTH9) and beta-expansin (EXPB1) show down-regulated expression, while the expression of several genes encoding alpha-expansin proteins is up-regulated at Time 45. Well-characterized genes encoding membrane based transporters that are differentially expressed include those encoding calcium exchanger CAX1, calcium-transporting ATPase ACA2, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels CNGC19 and CNGC1, potassium transporter HAK5 and inorganic phosphate transporter PHT1. The 500 bp upstream regions of the down-regulated and up-regulated genes at Time 45 were statistically analyzed for over-represented six-mer sequences (motifs), which may correspond to cis-regulatory elements. Table 4 lists the ten motifs with the highest significance (lowest p-values) for both the up-regulated and down-regulated subsets of genes. The motif with the highest significance in the subset of up-regulated genes is an ABRE coupling element (ABRE-CE). The 325 differentially expressed genes at Time 45 were furthermore compared with a cluster of 197 genes that are known to be differentially expressed in response to a broad range of stress conditions, including cold, osmotic stress, salinity, wounding, and biotic stresses [28]. The comparison showed that at least 18 of the 325 genes differentially expressed at Time 45 appear to be universally responsive to stress conditions (Table 5). These include for example genes encoding Ca2+-binding, kinase, zinc finger, and disease resistance proteins. Table 2.

Membrane transporters Col-0 time series Of special interest is the differential expression of transporter genes as they may represent a metabolic strategy for tolerance to an elevated magnesium sulfate environment. Over 200 different genes encoding membrane-based transporters were differentially expressed across the Col-0 time series (Table S2). Since the Time 90 and 180 comparisons are not fully controlled for diurnal effects, gene expression differences for several transporter genes of interest to this study were analyzed by Q-PCR using diurnally controlled samples. The number of differentially expressed transporter genes increased from 13 at Time 45, to 74 at Time 90 and 189 at Time 180 (Table 2). The expression of the 217 unique genes encoding transporters across the Col-0 time series was analyzed by cluster algorithms to reveal subsets of genes with corresponding patterns of expression (Fig. 7 and Fig. S1). Figure 7. Hierarchical average linkage cluster analysis of transporter gene expression using uncentered correlation. Open in a new tab The cluster analysis is based on transporter genes with significant expression at Time 45, 90 or 180. Yellow denotes a higher, and blue a lower expression of a gene in the treated plants versus the control. The figure shows that distinct clusters of expression patterns can be distinguished within the group of transporter genes across the three comparisons. The full cluster set is shown on the left; subsets of the clusters are expanded to the right to allow closer inspection of the differential expression patterns. The first 10 letters of the annotation are provided in the expanded sections. The fully annotated figure can be found in the Supplemental material (Fig. S1).The differential expression of genes encoding known magnesium, sulfate and calcium/proton transporters is summarized in Table 6. The summary shows that the expression of the genes encoding magnesium transporters MRS2-10 and MRS2-7 is slightly up-regulated. Genes encoding sulfate transporters SULTR3;4, SULTR3;1 and SULTR4;1 (a vacuolar H+/SO4 2− cotransporter) show down-regulated expression. The down-regulated expression of the gene encoding SULTR3;4 was confirmed by Q-PCR at 180 min., although its down-regulated expression was less pronounced when controlled for diurnal effects (Table 7, Fig. 8). The gene encoding the vacuolar Mg2+/H+ antiporter (MHX) shows up-regulated expression, while the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ antiporters CAX1, CAX2 and CAX3 show down-regulated expression. The down-regulated expression of CAX1 was confirmed by Q-PCR after 180 min. of exposure when controlled for diurnal effects (Table 7, Fig. 8). Besides the genes described above, there were many examples of differentially expressed genes encoding transporters of unknown function belonging to several large transporter gene families. Represented families include the MATE efflux family, the ABC transporter family, the integral membrane family, the major intrinsic protein family, the cation efflux family, the cation-chloride cotransporter family, the anion exchange family, and the ATPase E1–E2 type family. In addition, several genes encoding transporter-related proteins and putative transporters were differentially expressed. Table 6.

    "discussion": "Discussion The use of regolith on Mars with high levels of hydrated sulfate minerals for bioregenerative life support systems will lead to exposure of plant roots to supra-optimal concentrations of both Mg2+ and SO4 2− ions in the soil solution. The results in this study show that knockout mutant lines of the known genes in Arabidopsis encoding root plasma membrane based uptake transporters of Mg2+ and SO4 2− ions failed to confer an adaptive advantage to a MgSO4·7H2O enriched environment. Because sel1-10 mutants are known to take up 80% less sulfate than their wildtype background Ws, these results mean that phytotoxic effects of magnesium sulfate on overall plant growth are dominated by the Mg2+ cation. Overexpression of AtMRS2-10 (AtMGT1) in Nicotiana benthamiana led to increased accumulation of magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) per unit dry weight and per plant compared to wildtype plants [29]. However, the potential role of AtMRS2-10 as a major uptake transporter of Mg2+ in Arabidopsis remains uncertain based on the observation that mrs2-10 plants did not show a significant difference in leaf Mg levels compared to Col-0 under standard nutrient conditions. This could explain why, despite the indication that Mg dominantly affects overall plant growth, the mrs2-10 mutant did not show a significant improvement in growth performance compared to Col-0. Interestingly, the dominant role of Mg is also supported by the relative tolerance of the cax1-1 vacuolar H+/Ca2+ transport mutant plants to elevated levels of MgSO4·7H2O. The soil data shown in Figures 5 and 6 are in line with the relative tolerance of cax1-1 on agar to high concentrations of dissolved MgCl2, a mineral in which the Mg2+ cation is the dominant phytotoxic factor [16]. In addition, Bradshaw et al (2005) observed that cax1 mutants are better able to tolerate the low Ca∶Mg ratios characteristic of terrestrial serpentine soils. The CAX1 knockout mutation does not fully eliminate the effects of high magnesium sulfate on plant growth performance; the absolute FW shoot biomass of cax1-1 grown on soil for four weeks was still low (20%) compared to untreated Col-0. The primary Arabidopsis Col-0 root transcriptome responses to elevated levels of magnesium sulfate suggest a number of candidate genes that could play a role in enhancing the growth performance of plants exposed to this nutrient stress. Transcriptome responses of Arabidopsis Col-0 roots exposed to MgSO4·7H2O versus a control solution for 45 min. revealed over 300 differentially expressed genes. Genes of known functional category include those encoding enzymes involved in hormone metabolism, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, kinases, disease resistance proteins, cell wall related proteins, and membrane-based transporters. The biological significance of this seemingly diverse set of gene classes illustrates the comprehensive nature of a primary abiotic stress response. The differentially expressed genes at Time 45 encoding enzymes in the ABA, ethylene and jasmonate biosynthesis pathways point to possible changes in the synthesis of these phytohormones. ABA, ethylene, and jasmonic acid have all been implicated in adaptive mechanisms of osmotic stress, ion-mediated signal transduction and the regulation of transporters [30], [31], [32]. The exact role of many of the differentially expressed genes at Time 45 encoding transcription factors is currently unknown, although some are associated with tolerance to other abiotic stresses. The up-regulation at Time 45 of the gene encoding ZAT7 is for example in line with the finding that ZAT7 renders plants more tolerant to salinity stress when constitutively expressed [33]. The down-regulation at Time 45 of the gene encoding WRKY70 correlates with the observation that WRKY70 functions as a negative regulator of developmental senescence and is involved in plant defense signaling pathways [34]. The majority of transcripts encoding kinases that are differentially expressed at Time 45 encode uncharacterized protein kinases as well as receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) with extracytoplasmic leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) or with an extracellular lectin-like domain. RLKs are membrane-spanning proteins with a predicted signal sequence and a cytoplasmic kinase domain that have been implicated in a wide range of signal transduction pathways [35]. The up-regulated expression of the gene encoding CBL-interacting protein kinase CIPK9 at Time 45 is consonant with the fact that CIPK9 is required for low-potassium tolerance in Arabidopsis [36]. Genes encoding proteins that belong to the transcription factor or kinase categories might be transcriptional or post-translational regulators of transporters [37]. Within the group of genes encoding membrane based transporters, the Ca2+/H+ antiporter CAX1 is one of the few transporter genes that are already differentially expressed at Time 45. Its down-regulated expression is in line with our finding that the cax1-1 mutant performed better compared to wildtype when grown on soil with elevated levels of magnesium sulfate. The slightly up-regulated expression of the gene encoding magnesium transporter MRS2-10 at Time 90 and 180 agrees with the observation that a knockout mutant of AtMRS2-10 (mrs2-10) does not show improved growth in the form of higher FW shoot biomass compared to Col-0 at elevated levels of magnesium sulfate. MRS2 transporters have been shown to transport other ions in addition to Mg2+ [29], [38]. Schock et al. (2002) speculate that, in line with the large number of AtMRS2 family members, the function of the AtMRS2 gene family may be the maintenance of metal ion homeostasis in different cellular compartments (i.e. over different cellular membrane systems). The expression of the gene encoding SULTR1;2, a high-affinity sulfate transporter, showed no significant differences at the three time points. The fact that expression of the gene is not down-regulated in the early adaptation response of Arabidopsis roots to high levels of magnesium sulfate supports the outcome of the FW shoot biomass comparison between the AtSULTR1;2 knockout mutant sel1-10 and Col-0, which showed no advantage for sel1-10. The gene encoding EIL3, one of the known transcriptional regulators of SULTR1;2 [39], did not show a significant difference in expression at any of the time points either. Interestingly, two sulfate transporter genes of the same family as SULTR1;2 show down-regulated expression; the gene encoding SULTR3;4 at Time 90 and 180, and the gene encoding SULTR3;1 at Time 180. The spatial and subcellular localization of these transporters is not known, and so far no influence on the expression of Group 3 sulfate transporters by the sulfur status of plants has been reported [40]. This study shows for the first time that genes encoding Group 3 sulfate transporters SULTR3;1 and SULTR3;4 are differentially expressed in roots upon exposure to high levels of sulfate. The expression of the gene encoding another sulfate transporter - the tonoplast-localized H+/SO4 2− cotransporter SULTR4;1 - is also down-regulated at Time 180, pointing at the possible retention of excess SO4 2− in the vacuole. Similarly, the up-regulated expression of the gene encoding the vacuolar MHX transporter indicates the possible storage of excess Mg2+ in the vacuole. Both MHX and SULTR1;4 could be seen as marker genes for excess magnesium sulfate recognition by the plant, since vacuolar storage of excess ions is a well-known defense mechanism against ion stress. Several members of the CAX (cation exchanger) family show down-regulated expression in response to elevated magnesium sulfate. The Ca2+/H+ antiporter CAX1, which shows down-regulated expression across the time points, is localized to the tonoplast and responsible for 50% of the Ca2+/H+ antiport activity there [16]. CAX2 has been shown to transport Ca2+ and Mn2+ into the vacuole in Arabidopsis and other plant species [41], and CAX3 is known as a weak Ca2+ vacuolar transporter. CAX1 and CAX3 can be combined as “hetero-CAX” complexes to form functional transporters with distinct transport properties [42]. The down-regulated expression of the genes encoding these three vacuolar Ca2+/H+ antiporters indicates a possible shortage of calcium in the cytosol upon high magnesium sulfate exposure. In total, over 200 differentially expressed genes encoding membrane-based transporters were identified across the Col-0 time series. Among the genes encoding transporters of known and unknown function, candidates for improving plant tolerance to high magnesium sulfate may be found. Transporters of unknown function include for example major intrinsic proteins, cyclic nucleotide gated channels, integral membrane proteins, cation efflux family proteins, ATPase E1–E2 type family proteins, MATE efflux family proteins, transporter-related proteins and putative transporters. The differential expression of only four unique transcripts between cax1-1 and Col-0 plants after 180 min. of MgSO4·7H2O treatment indicates that the root transcriptome responses are virtually identical for the two genotypes at this time after initiation of treatment. In our transcriptome study we see down-regulation of the gene encoding vacuolar sulfate efflux transporter SULTR4;1 at Time 180, and up-regulation of the gene encoding vacuolar magnesium influx transporter MHX at Time 90 and Time 180 in Col-0 exposed to elevated magnesium sulfate. Both of these responses point to storage of excess magnesium and sulfate ions in the vacuole. This means that the profile is most probably not performed at a time point before plants recognize excess magnesium sulfate, especially since over 3000 differentially expressed genes were detected in Col-0 at Time 180, in addition to the vacuolar marker genes. We could therefore not foresee that after 180 minutes of exposure there were no more than four differentially expressed transcripts between the cax1-1 mutant and Col-0. One of the main reasons for the limited number of differentially regulated transcripts between the genotypes at this time after initiation of treatment may be that CAX1 is one of the few transporter genes that are already differentially expressed after 45 min. of exposure in Col-0, which means that down-regulated expression of CAX1 is an important natural response of Arabidopsis to elevated levels of magnesium sulfate. The response of CAX1 and other CAX family members in the Col-0 time series suggests that a deficiency of calcium caused by high levels of magnesium and possibly by calcium sulfate precipitation could play a major part in the reduction of plant growth performance in the presence of high magnesium sulfate concentrations. The difference between the immediately down-regulated level of CAX1 in Col-0 and the absence of CAX1 in the cax1-1 knockout mutant is apparently not sufficiently large at 180 min. after initiation of treatment to reveal many of the downstream molecular processes eventually leading to enhanced growth performance and reduced leaf Mg content of cax1-1 compared to Col-0 after several weeks of growth. This result is significant in that follow-up studies contrasting cax1-1 with Col-0 can look at profiles after possibly even days of exposure. Conclusions and perspectives It was initially thought that the mrs2-10 and sel1-10 mutants would have an advantage over wildtype in elevated magnesium sulfate soils, but this was not the case. However, fresh weight shoot biomass analyses showed that although mrs2-10 and sel1-10 mutants were not more successful than wildtype in this soil environment, the cax1 mutants were. Thus, cax1 mutants are currently the only confirmed genotype with partial tolerance to the phytotoxic levels of magnesium sulfate expected for the regolith on Mars. To further characterize the response of Arabidopsis to Mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate a set of experiments was conducted to evaluate patterns of gene expression in wildtype (Col-0) and cax1 mutants. The 325 genes differentially expressed in Col-0 roots after 45 min. of exposure to high magnesium sulfate can be seen as candidate genes for enhanced tolerance. This set of genes included CAX1, 18 genes previously associated with enhanced tolerance to broad ranges of abiotic stresses, and several well-characterized genes known to enhance tolerance to other salts like NaCl. Many of the differentially regulated genes contain promoter sequence motifs that are known to play a role in ABA-mediated regulation, such as ABRE-CE. This abundance suggests that ABA plays a role in regulating the stress response to elevated magnesium sulfate. In addition, a rich pool of candidates is found in the 200+ transporter genes that are differentially expressed in Col-0 across the time points. Many genes in this set encode transporters of unknown function. These unknown transporter genes, along with the four differentially regulated transcripts between cax1-1 and Col-0, are of particular interest as they encode proteins of unknown function whose roles are now at least implicated. This study functions as a solid basis for the development of Mars soil-compatible plants by reducing the number of potential candidate genes from tens of thousands to several hundred. Future research efforts could determine whether any of these candidate genes, or their potential regulators, can be confirmed as genomic loci for (crop) plant growth enhancement in the presence of mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate.",

Copyright notice ID: 2925951 PMID: 20808807 Abstract Background Martian regolith (unconsolidated surface material) is a potential medium for plant growth in bioregenerative life support systems during manned missions on Mars. However, hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels in the regolith of Mars can reach as high as 10 wt%, and would be expected to be highly inhibitory to plant growth.Methodology and Principal Findings Disabling ion transporters AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2, which are plasma membrane localized in peripheral root cells, is not an effective way to confer tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils. Arabidopsis mrs2-10 and sel1-10 knockout lines do not mitigate the growth inhibiting impacts of high MgSO4·7H2O concentrations observed with wildtype plants. A global approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to high MgSO4·7H2O (magnesium sulfate) stress. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in Col-0, and also between Col-0 and the mutant line cax1-1, which was confirmed to be relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO4·7H2O in soil solution. Differentially expressed genes in Col-0 treated for 45 min. encode enzymes primarily involved in hormone metabolism, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, kinases, cell wall related proteins and membrane-based transporters. Over 200 genes encoding transporters were differentially expressed in Col-0 up to 180 min. of exposure, and one of the first down-regulated genes was CAX1. The importance of this early response in wildtype Arabidopsis is exemplified in the fact that only four transcripts were differentially expressed between Col-0 and cax1-1 at 180 min. after initiation of treatment.Conclusions/Significance The results provide a solid basis for the understanding of the metabolic response of plants to elevated magnesium sulfate soils; it is the first transcriptome analysis of plants in this environment. The results foster the development of Mars soil-compatible plants by showing that cax1 mutants exhibit partial tolerance to magnesium sulfate, and by elucidating a small subset (500 vs. >10,000) of candidate genes for mutation or metabolic engineering that will enhance tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils.Introduction Long duration human missions to Mars must rely on more than just stored supplies and physico-chemical means to regenerate air and clean water. The Advanced Life Support (ALS) scenarios envisioned for extended manned missions will depend upon the efficient use of local planetary resources and the recycling of limited materials such as water, pressurized atmosphere, and organic matter, while producing food to augment supplies [1]. The use of in situ regolith for plant growth in a future bioregenerative life support system on Mars may have several advantages over hydroponic systems [2], [3]. These include the immediate bioavailability of plant essential ions, low-tech mechanical support for plants, and easy access to in situ materials once on the surface. However, plant growth may be reduced or inhibited by phytotoxic substances in the regolith, such as high levels of soluble magnesium sulfate minerals. Hydrated forms of magnesium sulfate such as MgSO4·7H2O (epsomite) and MgSO4·H2O (kieserite) have been detected in several regions by the Mars Express Satellite [4], [5], [6]. Analyses by the Mars Exploration Rover landers at Meridiani Planum and Gusev crater have also indicated the presence of high levels of magnesium sulfate minerals (up to 10 wt%) in outcrops and soils [7], [8], [9]. High levels of hydrated sulfate minerals in regolith on Mars used in bioregenerative life support systems will lead to exposure of plant roots to supra-optimal concentrations of both Mg2+ and SO4 2− ions in the soil solution. Plants may have evolved to cope with relatively high levels of elements in the soil environment by limiting internal accumulation or tolerating high internal concentrations [10]. In a potential bioregenerative life support system on Mars, an excess of a particular element in the crew's diet could affect the availability of other required elements. This study therefore first determined whether knockout mutant lines for genes encoding certain transporters responsible for uptake of Mg2+ and SO4 2− ions in roots could enhance plant tolerance to high levels of magnesium sulfate in the growth medium and then moved to a molecular analysis of the responses to Mg2+ and SO4 2− in order to increase the potential pool of candidate genes. Various efforts have previously illustrated that the disabling of transporter genes can indeed improve tolerance to certain elements. For example, a line of transgenic wheat plants expressing an antisense construct of the high affinity K+ transporter TaHKT2;1 showed reduced sodium uptake by roots and enhanced growth relative to unstressed plants compared to a control line at high levels of NaCl in the growth medium [11]. Several plasma membrane localized proteins in the outer cell layers of Arabidopsis roots are known to be responsible for magnesium or sulfate ion uptake. Two specific genes, AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2, were chosen for this study, in part because of their localization and because of availability of knockout lines. AtMRS2-10 ( = AtMGT1) functionally complemented a bacterial mutant lacking Mg2+ transport capability and AtMRS2-10-GFP–expressing plants showed fluorescence in the periphery of root cells, suggesting a plasma membrane association [12]. AtMRS2-10 is, to date, the only member of the AtMRS2 family that is known to be associated to the plasma membrane of root cells in addition to having Mg2+ ion transport capability. Therefore, a knockout mutant line of the AtMRS2-10 gene (mrs 2-10) was characterized for this study based on the SALK_100361.41.30.x T-DNA insertion line [13]. AtSULTR1;2 is a constitutively expressed sulfate transporter gene whose product AtSULTR1;2 is localized in root hair, epidermal and cortical cells where it ensures sulfate uptake into plants under sulfur-replete conditions [14]. A knockout mutant line of the AtSULTR1;2 gene (sel1-10) was shown to take up 80% less sulfate than wildtype when grown for 12 days on agar with optimal levels (1.7 mM MgSO4·7H2O) of sulfate [15]. Knockout lines of genes encoding vacuolar H+/Ca2+ transporters CAX1 and CAX3 were also analyzed to present perspective of other, non-plasma membrane, cellular transporter locations. The cax1-1 and cax1/cax3 lines were previously shown to be more tolerant of high Mg2+ levels in the form of MgCl2 when grown on agar [16], [17]. In a separate study, a CAX1 knockout mutant was identified through a mutant screen on nutrient solutions reflecting low Ca∶Mg ratios characteristic of serpentine soils [18]. When high MgSO4·7H2O concentrations are applied, the Ca∶Mg ratio of the nutrient solution decreases, which therefore makes the cax1-1 and cax1/cax3 mutants candidates for high magnesium sulfate tolerance. This study determined whether enhanced tolerance to low Ca∶Mg ratios is maintained when cax1-1 and cax1/cax3 mutants are exposed to elevated SO4 2− in addition to elevated Mg2+ in soil medium. These candidate genes for enhanced magnesium sulfate tolerance that are presented above were selected based on previous literature describing the results of individual gene or gene family analyses. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses of plants exposed to elevated concentrations of magnesium, sulfate, or magnesium sulfate in the growth medium have not been reported to date. In order to increase the number of candidate genes that could play a role in enhancing growth performance of plants exposed to this abiotic stress, root transcriptome remodeling in Col-0 was analyzed after short-term (45 min.) hydroponic exposure to a non-lethal, high concentration of MgSO4·7H2O. This early time point was chosen to capture part of the primary stress responses. The differential expression of transporter genes was analyzed after 90 min. and 180 min. in addition to 45 min., as this group in particular may represent a metabolic strategy for tolerance to an elevated magnesium sulfate environment. The root transcriptome of the transporter gene knockout mutant cax1-1 was furthermore contrasted with that of Col-0 after both genotypes were exposed to MgSO4·7H2O treatment for 180 min. Based on their previously identified tolerance to high MgCl2 and low Ca∶Mg ratios, cax1 mutants are likely to show enhanced growth compared to wildtype when exposed to high magnesium sulfate levels. Furthermore, ionome analyses of cax1 mutants showed that they have significantly reduced levels of Mg2+ in their leaves compared to wildtype [18].The cax1/cax3 double knockout mutant, while having the potential to show tolerance to elevated MgSO4·7H2O based on its tolerance to MgCl2 and its reduced shoot levels of Mg2+, showed significant differences in concentration of multiple elements, and grew more slowly than wildtype under regular nutrient conditions [17]. Since cax1-1 mutants did not display negative effects on growth under regular nutrient conditions, cax1-1 rather than cax1/cax3 was included in the root transcriptome analysis. Genes differentially regulated between cax1-1 and Col-0 grown under stress conditions could reveal those molecular processes possibly leading to significant differences in growth performance at the whole plant level. A hydroponic medium was chosen to mimic root exposure to a specific soil solution in order to directly link transcriptome responses to the level of bioavailable ions that roots may experience in a hypothetical root zone of a regolith profile on Mars [19]. The treatment concentration of MgSO4·7H2O was based on the low Ca∶Mg ratio that can occur in serpentine soils on Earth. Because of their high amount of bioavailable magnesium, Serpentine soils can be seen as a partial analogue for regolith high in magnesium sulfate on Mars [20].Materials and Methods Mrs2-10 T-DNA Insertion Line Characterization A homozygous knockout T-DNA insertion line for AtMRS2-10 (At1g80900) was identified by PCR and RT-PCR using the original SALK_100361.41.30.x line (Fig. 1a,b). For PCR, oligonucleotide primers MRS2-10_LP (5′-CAGGATCAAAGCATCGTTCTC-3′) and MRS2-10_RP (5′-TAGGAGCTCAGAAGACGCAAC-3′) were designed using software available on the Salk Institute website (http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.html). In addition, the T-DNA specific primer LBb1 (5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3′) was included as designed and recommended by the Salk Institute. Combinations of the primers were used to identify plants for which the T-DNA insertion was present in both AtMRS2-10 alleles. Genomic DNA was extracted from T-DNA insertion mutant leaves using the Shorty method. For this method, 500 uL Shorty Buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCL pH 9.0, 0.4 M LiCl, 25 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS) was added to ground leaf tissue (∼0.25 cm2) in a microcentrifuge tube. The tube was then spun for 5 min. at high speed in a microcentrifuge. Supernatant (350 uL) was transferred to a new tube containing isopropanol (350 uL). The two volumes were mixed by inversion and the tube was spun for 10 min. at top speed in a microcentrifuge. After this, the liquid was discarded and the pellet was air-dried before being resuspended in 100 uL TE buffer. Genomic DNA was extracted from Col-0 leaves using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). PCR was carried out using JumpStart Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma). PCR products were separated in agarose gels and stained with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen). A confirmed homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant was backcrossed to Col-0 three times before allowing self-fertilization. Homozygous plants backcrossed 3× were identified by PCR and used for seed generation. For RT-PCR, RNA was extracted from leaves of Col-0 and a homozygous T-DNA insertion line for AtMRS2-10 (At80900) with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Gene specific oligonucleotide primers MRS2-10_LP1 (5′-AGGGTTACTTTGTCGGAGA-3′) and MRS2-10_RP1 (5′-TACACGGGGTTTTATCTTG-3′) were designed based on Arabidopsis genomic DNA sequence information (). Alpha-(α)-Tubulin was used as a constitutive control with primers according to Yoshimoto (2002). RT-PCR was carried out using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). PCR products were separated in agarose gels and stained with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen). An ionome analysis of the backcrossed homozygous AtMRS2-10 knockout mutants (mrs2-10) was performed as part of the Purdue Ionomics project and results are available online through the Purdue Ionomics Information Management System (http://www.ionomicshub.org/home/PiiMS) [21]. Figure 1. Homozygous knockout mutant line mrs2-10. Open in a new tab (a) A homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant for AtMRS2-10 (At1g80900) was identified by PCR based on the SALK_100361.41.30.x line. (b) RNA extracted from mrs2-10 and Col-0 leaves was tested for the presence of MRS2-10 mRNA with gene-specific primers. Alpha-(α)-Tubulin (TUB) was used as a constitutive control.Plant Growth Experiments on Soil Medium Seeds from the Ws, Col-0, mrs2-10, sel1-10 [15], cax1-1 [16] and cax1/cax3 [17] lines were sterilized by soaking them for 15 minutes in a 40% (v/v) bleach solution with a drop of Tween 20 (polyoxyethylenesorbitanmonolaureate). The seeds were then washed six times with sterilized (autoclaved) water. To control for environmental variation when comparing plant growth per concentration, each tray was divided in 8 sections of 6 wells each, with either a mutant line or its associated wildtype background line planted in one section, in alternating fashion. This method resulted in 4 sections per seed line per tray. The seeds were evenly planted (5 seeds per tray well) on the soil medium (sphagnum peat moss, vermiculite and perlite) that was wetted with nutrient solution. The basic and control nutrient solution consisted of 2.2 g/L Murashige and Skoog salts (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 g/L MES buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). For the treatments, MgSO4·7H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the basic solution at 20, 60, 80 or 100 mM concentration. The pH of the solutions was adjusted to 5.70–5.75 with KOH. The trays with soil were covered with plastic wrap to maintain sufficient humidity and placed in a cold room at 4°C for three days. After stratification, the trays were moved to a growth room at 23°C where they were randomly placed on the growth benches. There, the seeds germinated, the plastic wrap was removed after 3–5 days, and the surviving plants were thinned to two plants per well (maximum of 12 plants per section) after one week to maintain sufficient spacing. The plants were sub-irrigated twice a week, alternatively with tap water and the appropriate nutrient solution. The plants were analyzed at week 4 and the experiment was repeated three times.Growth Performance Measurements and Statistical Analysis Fresh weight biomass of plants grown on soil was measured by grouping and weighing whole shoots of plants per tray section. Leaf chlorophyll content of plants grown on soil medium was measured with a Minolta SPAD-502 meter. One leaf measurement per plant per tray well was taken. Biomass or chlorophyll levels of wildtype and knockout mutant Arabidopsis lines were evaluated in a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) model using SAS 9.2 and JMP Genomics 7 software. Genotype and concentration were included in the ANOVA model as fixed effects, while batch (replication set) was included as a random effect. Unbiased estimates of biomass or chlorophyll levels (least-square means) were generated for each effect (genotype, concentration, or genotype and concentration) per experiment. The estimated levels of biomass or chlorophyll were then compared using a series of t-tests, generating estimated differences and corresponding p-values. Differences with associated p-values<0.05 were considered significant. Results of the ANOVA analysis are presented in Table S1.Hydroponic Root Growth The hydroponic set-up for Arabidopsis that was used in this study is based on two previously described systems [22], [23]. Glass containers (2.6 L) were covered with opaque black plastic sheeting along the glass, and with opaque plastic lids across the top. In each opaque plastic lid, 18 holes (d = 1.43 cm) were made at regular intervals with a hole puncher. A 2-cm-long Rockwool (Grodan) plug (d = 1.59 cm) was placed in each hole. Containers were filled with a nutrient solution adjusted to pH 5.7 by KOH that was replaced once a week. It consisted of distilled water, 0.25 g/L MES buffer, and 1/32x MS salts during week 1 and 2, while the concentration of MS salts increased to 1/16x during week 3. Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and stratified before planting about ten seeds per Rockwool plug. Col-0 seeds were planted on 18 containers while cax1-1 seeds were planted on 6. Containers were covered with transparent plastic wrap during the first 3–5 days of germination. Holes were made in the plastic wrap after 1–3 days depending on the general atmospheric humidity. The containers were randomly placed over 3 benches (8 containers/bench). Air was supplied to the roots by one 3W air pump per 8 containers; each container had an airstone made from glass beads. After one week, seedlings were thinned to one seedling per Rockwool plug, so that every container supported 18 plants (Fig. 2a). At day 21, Col-0 and cax1-1 roots were exposed to the basic nutrient solution (0.25 g/L MES, 1/16x MS, pH 5.7) with an additional 2.08 mM magnesium sulfate (total Ca∶Mg ratio = 1∶15). Col-0 was exposed for 45 min., 90 min., or 180 min., while cax1-1 was exposed for 180 min. only. The Col-0 control set received no extra magnesium sulfate and was harvested at 45 min. together with the first Col-0 treatment set. Four replicate containers were harvested for the control and each of the treatment sets (Fig. 2b). Roots were cut below the Rockwool plug and pooled per container before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Figure 2. Overview of hydroponic Arabidopsis growth and root harvest. Open in a new tab (a) Set-up for the microarray experiment. (b) Example of Arabidopsis roots after 21 days of growth, and of root harvest per container for the microarray and Q-PCR experiments.Microarray Procedures, Statistical Analysis and Data display RNA was extracted from root samples with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Samples were weighed while still frozen and reagents were adjusted to the total measured weight for the grinding and lysing step. Two replicate extractions were completed per sample with lysate volumes corresponding to 100 mg frozen wet weight each. The remainder of a sample was stored at −80°C as cleared lysate according to the Qiagen protocol. The quality and quantity of the extracted RNA was checked with denaturing agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and the NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). RNA from each sample was amplified and labeled with cy3 dye by using Agilent Quick Amp labeling kit, one color. A total of 20 samples were hybridized to five 4×44k Arabidopsis microarray slides (Agilent), which were then washed and scanned before data was extracted. Microarray handling and data extraction was done at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) at the University of Florida according to the One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis (Quick Amp Labeling) Protocol (version 5.7). Median signal intensities were quantile normalized using R software. Log2 transformed normalized data were evaluated using a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) model [24], [25] implemented in SAS 9.2 that included the fixed effect of each genotype and time of tissue harvest. Unbiased, least square means estimates of transcript abundance were generated and gene expression measured in each treatment was then compared to a control using a series of t-tests; Col-0 sets treated for 45 min., 90 min., or 180 min were compared to the Col-0 set exposed to a control solution for 45 min., and these three comparisons are referred to in the text, tables and figures as Time 45, Time 90, and Time 180 respectively (Fig. 3). In addition, the cax1-1 set treated for 180 min. was compared to the Col-0 set treated for 180 min. (Fig. 3). The p-values generated in these comparisons were corrected for multiple testing by controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) with the Q-value procedure in the Q-value 1.0 package (default settings) of the R software [26]. A default q-value threshold of 0.05 was used to declare a significant difference in gene expression between treatment and control. The results of the ANOVA analysis are presented in Table S2. Lists of genes with statistically significant changes in expression were further organized, analyzed and displayed in tables and figures using JMP Genomics 7, R software, GeneVenn, GOstat, Cluster 3.0, Java TreeView 1.1.4r5, the  () BLAST tool, and the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) Motif analysis tool. Figure 3. Overview of the microarray experiment. Open in a new tab The experiment included 20 arrays in total, each with a single cy3-labeled sample hybridized to it. Each sample set consisted of 4 biological replicates. Gene expression was compared among the sets as indicated by the arrows; Col-0 sets treated for 45 min., 90 min., or 180 min. were compared to the Col-0 set exposed to a control solution for 45 min., and these three comparisons are referred to in the text, tables and figures as Time 45, Time 90, and Time 180 respectively. The comparison of cax1-1 with Col-0 treated for 180 min. is not referred to in abbreviated form.Quantitative Real-time PCR Wildtype Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were grown hydroponically for 21 days as described above. At day 21, four containers received a replacement of the basic nutrient solution (0.25 g/L MES, 1/16x MS, pH5.7), while another four containers received the basic solution with an additional 2.08 mM magnesium sulfate (total Ca∶Mg ratio = 1∶15). Roots of treatment and control plants were exposed for 180 min. before being harvested per container. RNA was extracted and checked for quality and quantity as described above. RNA from these independently grown plants exposed or unexposed for 180 min., as well as RNA from plants exposed for 180 min. and unexposed for 45 min. in the microarray experiment, were used for the quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analyses. Q-PCR was performed using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). 1 ug of total RNA was reverse transcribed per sample for a total of three control and three treatment samples. Primers were designed for 5 genes using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) (Table 1). At2g32170 was chosen as a stably expressing reference gene appropriate for abiotic stress treatment [27]. Each template/primer pair combination was run in triplicate. The relative increase or decrease of mRNA abundance between the two sample sets was calculated by using the Pfaffl method, and statistical analysis of the results was done with the REST 2008 2.0.7 software.

Figure 4 shows the growth habit of mrs2-10 and sel1-10 plants compared to wildtype in the left hand panels, and of cax1-1 and cax1/cax3 compared to wildtype in the right-hand panels. Statistical analysis of the FW shoot biomass of wildtype Arabidopsis (Ws, Col-0) with ANOVA confirmed the significant phytotoxic effects of increasing concentrations of dissolved MgSO4·7H2O on wildtype plant growth (Table S1). Subsequent ANOVA analyses assessed whether selected mutant lines could alleviate the growth-limiting effects seen in wildtype. Results showed that FW shoot biomass and leaf chlorophyll content of mrs2-10 and sel1-10 lines were indistinguishable from that of wildtype at the tested concentrations (Fig. 5a–d, Table S1). Ionome analysis of the mrs2-10 mutant exposed to regular nutrient conditions furthermore did not reveal a statistically different leaf Mg content compared to Col-0 (http://www.ionomicshub.org/home/PiiMS). Although there was little difference between the mrs2-10 and sel1-10 lines and their respective wild-type backgrounds, the cax1-1 and cax1/cax3 lines showed relative improvement in their ability to grow on MgSO4·7H2O enriched soil. Cax1-1 plants had significantly higher FW shoot biomass and leaf chlorophyll content than Col-0 grown at 80 and 100 mM MgSO4·7H2O (Fig. 5e,g, Table S1). The increase in cax1-1 shoot biomass over that of Col-0 was 89% and 149% at 80 and 100 mM respectively. The CAX1 knockout mutation did not fully eliminate the effects of high magnesium sulfate on plant growth performance; the absolute FW shoot biomass of cax1-1 grown on soil for four weeks was still low (20%) compared to untreated Col-0 (Fig 5e). Cax1/cax3 plants showed significantly higher leaf chlorophyll content than Col-0 grown at 80, and 100 mM, but the average FW shoot biomass increases of 26.8% and 33.2%, at 80 and 100 mM, were not found to be statistically significant (Fig. 5f,h, Table S1). The significant differences in FW shoot biomass and leaf chlorophyll content between cax1/cax3 and Col-0 grown at 0 mM MgSO4·7H2O were described in detail by Cheng et al. (2005). In this study, 0 mM was only included as a point of reference for the high concentrations of MgSO4·7H2O. Figure 4. Overview of the Arabidopsis growth experiment on soil. Open in a new tab Mutant lines are grown alongside their respective wildtype backgrounds on trays containing soil medium with different levels of dissolved MgSO4·7H2O. To control for environmental variation, each tray was divided in 8 sections, with a mutant line and its associated wildtype background line planted in alternating fashion. Yellow boxes highlight the sections with mutant plants within each flat; the other sections contain wildtype plants. For the comparison between cax1/cax3 and Col-0, 60 mM was not tested. The plants shown here are 3 weeks old and were harvested and analyzed after completing 4 weeks of growth. The experiment was repeated three times.Figure 5.

Bars indicate standard error, n = 72. The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between genotypes (p<0.05) at specific concentrations of MgSO4·7H2O based on ANOVA.Root Transcriptome Root transcriptome remodeling was analyzed in Arabidopsis after hydroponic exposure to a non-lethal, high concentration of MgSO4·7H2O (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Table S2). The number of genes with statistically significant differences in expression between Col-0 exposed to MgSO4·7H2O and Col-0 exposed to control conditions increased from 325 (Time 45) to 1516 (Time 90) and 3265 (Time 180) (Fig. 6). The number of genes with a significant difference in expression of over 2-fold increased accordingly, from 100 to 248 and 445. Between cax1-1 and Col-0 exposed to MgSO4·7H2O for 180 min., only 4 unique transcripts showed a significant difference in expression, and all were over a 2-fold change in abundance (Fig. 6).

The horizontal line indicates the −log10 p-value where the q-value is 0.05. Transcripts whose expression difference (fold change) corresponds to a p-value for which q<0.05 are above the horizontal line and indicated in red.Primary MgSO4·7H2O stress response The primary root transcriptome responses to MgSO4·7H2O stress were analyzed in Col-0 treated for 45 min. versus Col-0 treated with a control solution for 45 min. (Time 45) to reveal genes involved in the metabolic response to this environment as candidate genes that could play a role in high magnesium sulfate tolerance. The resulting set of 325 genes with significant differences in expression was analyzed for over- and under-represented GO molecular function categories. Significantly over-represented categories were polygalacturonase activity, calcium ion binding, and transcription factor activity (Table 2). Many of the transcripts represented at Time 45 encode phytohormone associated proteins, transcription factors, Ca2+-binding proteins, kinases, phosphatases, disease resistance proteins, cell wall related proteins, membrane-based transporters, as well as proteins of unknown functional category. The better characterized of these genes are listed by category in Table 3. For example, phytohormone associated genes encoding enzymes involved in ABA (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase), ethylene (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase) and jasmonic acid (lipoxygenase ) biosynthesis pathways show up-regulated expression. The gene encoding C2H2 type zinc finger family transcription factor ZAT7 is up-regulated, while the gene encoding transcription factor WRKY70 is down-regulated at Time 45. The expression of the gene encoding CBL-interacting protein kinase CIPK9 is up-regulated. Genes encoding cell-wall and disease-resistance associated proteins are also well represented; fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (RHD1), xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XTH9) and beta-expansin (EXPB1) show down-regulated expression, while the expression of several genes encoding alpha-expansin proteins is up-regulated at Time 45. Well-characterized genes encoding membrane based transporters that are differentially expressed include those encoding calcium exchanger CAX1, calcium-transporting ATPase ACA2, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels CNGC19 and CNGC1, potassium transporter HAK5 and inorganic phosphate transporter PHT1. The 500 bp upstream regions of the down-regulated and up-regulated genes at Time 45 were statistically analyzed for over-represented six-mer sequences (motifs), which may correspond to cis-regulatory elements. Table 4 lists the ten motifs with the highest significance (lowest p-values) for both the up-regulated and down-regulated subsets of genes. The motif with the highest significance in the subset of up-regulated genes is an ABRE coupling element (ABRE-CE). The 325 differentially expressed genes at Time 45 were furthermore compared with a cluster of 197 genes that are known to be differentially expressed in response to a broad range of stress conditions, including cold, osmotic stress, salinity, wounding, and biotic stresses [28]. The comparison showed that at least 18 of the 325 genes differentially expressed at Time 45 appear to be universally responsive to stress conditions (Table 5). These include for example genes encoding Ca2+-binding, kinase, zinc finger, and disease resistance proteins. Table 2.

Over 200 different genes encoding membrane-based transporters were differentially expressed across the Col-0 time series (Table S2). Since the Time 90 and 180 comparisons are not fully controlled for diurnal effects, gene expression differences for several transporter genes of interest to this study were analyzed by Q-PCR using diurnally controlled samples. The number of differentially expressed transporter genes increased from 13 at Time 45, to 74 at Time 90 and 189 at Time 180 (Table 2). The expression of the 217 unique genes encoding transporters across the Col-0 time series was analyzed by cluster algorithms to reveal subsets of genes with corresponding patterns of expression (Fig. 7 and Fig. S1). Figure 7. Hierarchical average linkage cluster analysis of transporter gene expression using uncentered correlation. Open in a new tab The cluster analysis is based on transporter genes with significant expression at Time 45, 90 or 180. Yellow denotes a higher, and blue a lower expression of a gene in the treated plants versus the control. The figure shows that distinct clusters of expression patterns can be distinguished within the group of transporter genes across the three comparisons. The full cluster set is shown on the left; subsets of the clusters are expanded to the right to allow closer inspection of the differential expression patterns. The first 10 letters of the annotation are provided in the expanded sections. The fully annotated figure can be found in the Supplemental material (Fig. S1).The differential expression of genes encoding known magnesium, sulfate and calcium/proton transporters is summarized in Table 6. The summary shows that the expression of the genes encoding magnesium transporters MRS2-10 and MRS2-7 is slightly up-regulated. Genes encoding sulfate transporters SULTR3;4, SULTR3;1 and SULTR4;1 (a vacuolar H+/SO4 2− cotransporter) show down-regulated expression. The down-regulated expression of the gene encoding SULTR3;4 was confirmed by Q-PCR at 180 min., although its down-regulated expression was less pronounced when controlled for diurnal effects (Table 7, Fig. 8). The gene encoding the vacuolar Mg2+/H+ antiporter (MHX) shows up-regulated expression, while the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ antiporters CAX1, CAX2 and CAX3 show down-regulated expression. The down-regulated expression of CAX1 was confirmed by Q-PCR after 180 min. of exposure when controlled for diurnal effects (Table 7, Fig. 8). Besides the genes described above, there were many examples of differentially expressed genes encoding transporters of unknown function belonging to several large transporter gene families. Represented families include the MATE efflux family, the ABC transporter family, the integral membrane family, the major intrinsic protein family, the cation efflux family, the cation-chloride cotransporter family, the anion exchange family, and the ATPase E1–E2 type family. In addition, several genes encoding transporter-related proteins and putative transporters were differentially expressed. Table 6.

The results in this study show that knockout mutant lines of the known genes in Arabidopsis encoding root plasma membrane based uptake transporters of Mg2+ and SO4 2− ions failed to confer an adaptive advantage to a MgSO4·7H2O enriched environment. Because sel1-10 mutants are known to take up 80% less sulfate than their wildtype background Ws, these results mean that phytotoxic effects of magnesium sulfate on overall plant growth are dominated by the Mg2+ cation. Overexpression of AtMRS2-10 (AtMGT1) in Nicotiana benthamiana led to increased accumulation of magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) per unit dry weight and per plant compared to wildtype plants [29]. However, the potential role of AtMRS2-10 as a major uptake transporter of Mg2+ in Arabidopsis remains uncertain based on the observation that mrs2-10 plants did not show a significant difference in leaf Mg levels compared to Col-0 under standard nutrient conditions. This could explain why, despite the indication that Mg dominantly affects overall plant growth, the mrs2-10 mutant did not show a significant improvement in growth performance compared to Col-0. Interestingly, the dominant role of Mg is also supported by the relative tolerance of the cax1-1 vacuolar H+/Ca2+ transport mutant plants to elevated levels of MgSO4·7H2O. The soil data shown in Figures 5 and 6 are in line with the relative tolerance of cax1-1 on agar to high concentrations of dissolved MgCl2, a mineral in which the Mg2+ cation is the dominant phytotoxic factor [16]. In addition, Bradshaw et al (2005) observed that cax1 mutants are better able to tolerate the low Ca∶Mg ratios characteristic of terrestrial serpentine soils. The CAX1 knockout mutation does not fully eliminate the effects of high magnesium sulfate on plant growth performance; the absolute FW shoot biomass of cax1-1 grown on soil for four weeks was still low (20%) compared to untreated Col-0. The primary Arabidopsis Col-0 root transcriptome responses to elevated levels of magnesium sulfate suggest a number of candidate genes that could play a role in enhancing the growth performance of plants exposed to this nutrient stress. Transcriptome responses of Arabidopsis Col-0 roots exposed to MgSO4·7H2O versus a control solution for 45 min. revealed over 300 differentially expressed genes. Genes of known functional category include those encoding enzymes involved in hormone metabolism, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, kinases, disease resistance proteins, cell wall related proteins, and membrane-based transporters. The biological significance of this seemingly diverse set of gene classes illustrates the comprehensive nature of a primary abiotic stress response. The differentially expressed genes at Time 45 encoding enzymes in the ABA, ethylene and jasmonate biosynthesis pathways point to possible changes in the synthesis of these phytohormones. ABA, ethylene, and jasmonic acid have all been implicated in adaptive mechanisms of osmotic stress, ion-mediated signal transduction and the regulation of transporters [30], [31], [32]. The exact role of many of the differentially expressed genes at Time 45 encoding transcription factors is currently unknown, although some are associated with tolerance to other abiotic stresses. The up-regulation at Time 45 of the gene encoding ZAT7 is for example in line with the finding that ZAT7 renders plants more tolerant to salinity stress when constitutively expressed [33]. The down-regulation at Time 45 of the gene encoding WRKY70 correlates with the observation that WRKY70 functions as a negative regulator of developmental senescence and is involved in plant defense signaling pathways [34]. The majority of transcripts encoding kinases that are differentially expressed at Time 45 encode uncharacterized protein kinases as well as receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) with extracytoplasmic leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) or with an extracellular lectin-like domain. RLKs are membrane-spanning proteins with a predicted signal sequence and a cytoplasmic kinase domain that have been implicated in a wide range of signal transduction pathways [35]. The up-regulated expression of the gene encoding CBL-interacting protein kinase CIPK9 at Time 45 is consonant with the fact that CIPK9 is required for low-potassium tolerance in Arabidopsis [36]. Genes encoding proteins that belong to the transcription factor or kinase categories might be transcriptional or post-translational regulators of transporters [37]. Within the group of genes encoding membrane based transporters, the Ca2+/H+ antiporter CAX1 is one of the few transporter genes that are already differentially expressed at Time 45. Its down-regulated expression is in line with our finding that the cax1-1 mutant performed better compared to wildtype when grown on soil with elevated levels of magnesium sulfate. The slightly up-regulated expression of the gene encoding magnesium transporter MRS2-10 at Time 90 and 180 agrees with the observation that a knockout mutant of AtMRS2-10 (mrs2-10) does not show improved growth in the form of higher FW shoot biomass compared to Col-0 at elevated levels of magnesium sulfate. MRS2 transporters have been shown to transport other ions in addition to Mg2+ [29], [38]. Schock et al. (2002) speculate that, in line with the large number of AtMRS2 family members, the function of the AtMRS2 gene family may be the maintenance of metal ion homeostasis in different cellular compartments (i.e. over different cellular membrane systems). The expression of the gene encoding SULTR1;2, a high-affinity sulfate transporter, showed no significant differences at the three time points. The fact that expression of the gene is not down-regulated in the early adaptation response of Arabidopsis roots to high levels of magnesium sulfate supports the outcome of the FW shoot biomass comparison between the AtSULTR1;2 knockout mutant sel1-10 and Col-0, which showed no advantage for sel1-10. The gene encoding EIL3, one of the known transcriptional regulators of SULTR1;2 [39], did not show a significant difference in expression at any of the time points either. Interestingly, two sulfate transporter genes of the same family as SULTR1;2 show down-regulated expression; the gene encoding SULTR3;4 at Time 90 and 180, and the gene encoding SULTR3;1 at Time 180. The spatial and subcellular localization of these transporters is not known, and so far no influence on the expression of Group 3 sulfate transporters by the sulfur status of plants has been reported [40]. This study shows for the first time that genes encoding Group 3 sulfate transporters SULTR3;1 and SULTR3;4 are differentially expressed in roots upon exposure to high levels of sulfate. The expression of the gene encoding another sulfate transporter - the tonoplast-localized H+/SO4 2− cotransporter SULTR4;1 - is also down-regulated at Time 180, pointing at the possible retention of excess SO4 2− in the vacuole. Similarly, the up-regulated expression of the gene encoding the vacuolar MHX transporter indicates the possible storage of excess Mg2+ in the vacuole. Both MHX and SULTR1;4 could be seen as marker genes for excess magnesium sulfate recognition by the plant, since vacuolar storage of excess ions is a well-known defense mechanism against ion stress. Several members of the CAX (cation exchanger) family show down-regulated expression in response to elevated magnesium sulfate. The Ca2+/H+ antiporter CAX1, which shows down-regulated expression across the time points, is localized to the tonoplast and responsible for 50% of the Ca2+/H+ antiport activity there [16]. CAX2 has been shown to transport Ca2+ and Mn2+ into the vacuole in Arabidopsis and other plant species [41], and CAX3 is known as a weak Ca2+ vacuolar transporter. CAX1 and CAX3 can be combined as “hetero-CAX” complexes to form functional transporters with distinct transport properties [42]. The down-regulated expression of the genes encoding these three vacuolar Ca2+/H+ antiporters indicates a possible shortage of calcium in the cytosol upon high magnesium sulfate exposure. In total, over 200 differentially expressed genes encoding membrane-based transporters were identified across the Col-0 time series. Among the genes encoding transporters of known and unknown function, candidates for improving plant tolerance to high magnesium sulfate may be found. Transporters of unknown function include for example major intrinsic proteins, cyclic nucleotide gated channels, integral membrane proteins, cation efflux family proteins, ATPase E1–E2 type family proteins, MATE efflux family proteins, transporter-related proteins and putative transporters. The differential expression of only four unique transcripts between cax1-1 and Col-0 plants after 180 min. of MgSO4·7H2O treatment indicates that the root transcriptome responses are virtually identical for the two genotypes at this time after initiation of treatment. In our transcriptome study we see down-regulation of the gene encoding vacuolar sulfate efflux transporter SULTR4;1 at Time 180, and up-regulation of the gene encoding vacuolar magnesium influx transporter MHX at Time 90 and Time 180 in Col-0 exposed to elevated magnesium sulfate. Both of these responses point to storage of excess magnesium and sulfate ions in the vacuole. This means that the profile is most probably not performed at a time point before plants recognize excess magnesium sulfate, especially since over 3000 differentially expressed genes were detected in Col-0 at Time 180, in addition to the vacuolar marker genes. We could therefore not foresee that after 180 minutes of exposure there were no more than four differentially expressed transcripts between the cax1-1 mutant and Col-0. One of the main reasons for the limited number of differentially regulated transcripts between the genotypes at this time after initiation of treatment may be that CAX1 is one of the few transporter genes that are already differentially expressed after 45 min. of exposure in Col-0, which means that down-regulated expression of CAX1 is an important natural response of Arabidopsis to elevated levels of magnesium sulfate. The response of CAX1 and other CAX family members in the Col-0 time series suggests that a deficiency of calcium caused by high levels of magnesium and possibly by calcium sulfate precipitation could play a major part in the reduction of plant growth performance in the presence of high magnesium sulfate concentrations. The difference between the immediately down-regulated level of CAX1 in Col-0 and the absence of CAX1 in the cax1-1 knockout mutant is apparently not sufficiently large at 180 min. after initiation of treatment to reveal many of the downstream molecular processes eventually leading to enhanced growth performance and reduced leaf Mg content of cax1-1 compared to Col-0 after several weeks of growth. This result is significant in that follow-up studies contrasting cax1-1 with Col-0 can look at profiles after possibly even days of exposure. Conclusions and perspectives It was initially thought that the mrs2-10 and sel1-10 mutants would have an advantage over wildtype in elevated magnesium sulfate soils, but this was not the case. However, fresh weight shoot biomass analyses showed that although mrs2-10 and sel1-10 mutants were not more successful than wildtype in this soil environment, the cax1 mutants were. Thus, cax1 mutants are currently the only confirmed genotype with partial tolerance to the phytotoxic levels of magnesium sulfate expected for the regolith on Mars. To further characterize the response of Arabidopsis to Mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate a set of experiments was conducted to evaluate patterns of gene expression in wildtype (Col-0) and cax1 mutants. The 325 genes differentially expressed in Col-0 roots after 45 min. of exposure to high magnesium sulfate can be seen as candidate genes for enhanced tolerance. This set of genes included CAX1, 18 genes previously associated with enhanced tolerance to broad ranges of abiotic stresses, and several well-characterized genes known to enhance tolerance to other salts like NaCl. Many of the differentially regulated genes contain promoter sequence motifs that are known to play a role in ABA-mediated regulation, such as ABRE-CE. This abundance suggests that ABA plays a role in regulating the stress response to elevated magnesium sulfate. In addition, a rich pool of candidates is found in the 200+ transporter genes that are differentially expressed in Col-0 across the time points. Many genes in this set encode transporters of unknown function. These unknown transporter genes, along with the four differentially regulated transcripts between cax1-1 and Col-0, are of particular interest as they encode proteins of unknown function whose roles are now at least implicated. This study functions as a solid basis for the development of Mars soil-compatible plants by reducing the number of potential candidate genes from tens of thousands to several hundred. Future research efforts could determine whether any of these candidate genes, or their potential regulators, can be confirmed as genomic loci for (crop) plant growth enhancement in the presence of mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate.Supporting Information Table S1Plant growth performance ANOVA.

    "abstract": "Abstract The 14-3-3 proteins specifically bind a number of client proteins to influence important pathways, including flowering timing via the photosensory system. For instance, 14-3-3 proteins influence the photosensory system through interactions with Constans (CO) protein. 14-3-3 associations with the photosensory system were further studied in this investigation using 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants to study root and chloroplast development. The 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutant, 14-3-3μ-1, had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root length could be influenced by light intensity. The 14-3-3 ν T-DNA insertion mutants also had shorter roots, but only when grown under narrow-bandwidth red light. Five-day-old 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutants all had increased root greening compared with the wild type, which was influenced by light wavelength and intensity. However, beyond 10 d of growth, 14-3-3μ-1 roots did not increase in greening as much as wild-type roots. This study reveals new developmental roles of 14-3-3 proteins in roots and chloroplasts, probably via association with the photosensory system. Keywords: Chloroplast, photosensory system, plastid, 14-3-3 proteins, root development",
    "introduction": "Introduction The 14-3-3 proteins are predominantly known for their ability to bind certain phosphorylated proteins to complete phosphoregulation events (Ferl, 1996). In plants, 14-3-3 protein binding activity includes the regulation of key metabolic enzymes, such as nitrate reductase and sucrose synthase (Bachmann et al., 1996; Toroser et al., 1998), and also the activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Olsson et al., 1998; Fuglsang et al., 1999; Svennelid et al., 1999; Ottmann et al., 2007). Throughout eukaryotes, 14-3-3 proteins are known to bind a multitude of different proteins and, specifically, participate in a wide array of signal transduction regulatory events. Multicellular eukaryotes contain multiple 14-3-3 protein family members, or isoforms. The number of 14-3-3 isoforms can vary per organism, but Arabidopsis contains 13 expressed 14-3-3 genes (Wu et al., 1997; Rosenquist et al., 2001; Sehnke et al., 2006). The 14-3-3 proteins throughout eukaryotes share sequence homology within the core region of the protein sequence, but sequences of individual isoforms diverge in the amino- and carboxy-terminal tails. The importance of multiple 14-3-3 isoforms per organism remains to be elucidated, however, reverse genetic studies analysing knockout or knock down mutants continue to identify specific roles of individual 14-3-3 isoforms (Su et al., 2001; Sugiyama et al., 2003; Mayfield et al., 2007; Purwestri et al., 2009). In Arabidopsis, 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were utilized to find association of the 14-3-3 isoforms μ and υ with both light sensing during early development and time of transition to flowering (Mayfield et al., 2007). Red light-grown 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants exhibit decreased hypocotyl elongation inhibition (Mayfield et al., 2007) reminiscent of, but not identical to Phytochrome B (PHYB) mutants (Koornneef et al., 1980). The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants also flower later in long-day conditions (16 h of light), but not in short-day conditions (8 h of light) (Mayfield et al., 2007). In rice, the opposite phenotype occurs when manipulating expression of the 14-3-3 isoform, GF14c (Purwestri et al., 2009). Over-expression of GF14c results in delayed flowering, while knockout results in early flowering. These 14-3-3 mutant phenotypes indicate a role in light-related signalling for these particular 14-3-3 isoforms. The relationship of 14-3-3 proteins with light signalling is further supported by the observation that 14-3-3 proteins bind the blue light photoreceptor Phototropin 1 (PHOT1) (Kinoshita et al., 2003) and the flowering timing regulation protein Constans (CO) (Mayfield et al., 2007), as well as downstream targets such as Flowering Timing (FT) and Self-Pruning (SP) (Pnueli et al., 2001). Light perception is broadly important for phototropic responses, time of flowering, and root development. For example, Red and far-red light influence the directional growth of roots. Roots of some plants, such as maize and rice, grow horizontally in the dark, but grow downward when the plants are irradiated with red or far-red light from above (Takano et al., 2001; Lu et al., 1996). In addition, there is copious expression of photoreceptors in the roots (Pratt and Coleman, 1974; Somers and Quail, 1995; Toth et al., 2001), suggesting a functional relevance for photoreceptors in root development. Root hair development is enhanced by light and mediated by phytochromes (De Simone et al., 2000a, b). Further, both Phytochrome A (PHYA) and PHYB regulate red-light-induced root hair development while far-red-induced root hair development is regulated by PHYA alone (De Simone et al., 2000a). Photoreceptors also control chloroplast development in roots that are exposed to light. Prolonged exposure of plant roots to light stimulates the development of chloroplasts in the roots (Whatley, 1983). Chloroplast development in the roots is stimulated by red and blue light, with cryptochrome 1 and 2 (CRY1 and CRY2) as the primary regulators of blue light-stimulated chloroplast development and PHYB as the primary regulator in red light (Usami et al., 2004). This study utilizes the previously described T-DNA insertion mutants of 14-3-3 μ and υ to examine the roles of individual 14-3-3 isoforms in root elongation and chloroplast development, that are controlled by the photosensory system. A 14-3-3μ knockdown mutant containing a T-DNA insertion within the promoter of 14-3-3μ, 14-3-3μ-1 (Mayfield et al., 2007), exhibited shorter roots whose lengths were influenced by various light intensities. The 14-3-3υ knockout T-DNA insertion mutants, 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 (Mayfield et al., 2007), each contain a T-DNA insertion within the 14-3-3υ coding region and also had shorter roots than the wild type, but only when grown under narrow bandwidth red light. In addition, the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and CO mutants (co) (co-1; Redei, 1962; Koornneef et al., 1991) exhibited an increase in chloroplast numbers after 5 d of growth.",

    "results": "Results 14-3-3μ-1 has shorter roots than wild-type Wild-type and 14-3-3μ-1 were grown on vertical MS media agar plates under constant light conditions and assayed for root lengths after 8 d of growth (Fig. 1). The roots of 14-3-3μ-1, co, and phyB were statistically shorter than wild-type levels (α=9.006×10−61, 0.0011, and 3.744×10−13, respectively). The 14-3-3μ-1 roots were only ∼25% of wild-type root length (Fig. 1A, B), although developmentally similar in the aerial tissue. Wild-type root length was restored by the reintroduction of 14-3-3μ in Res-mu, a 14-3-3μ-1 line that was complemented by the native 14-3-3 μ gene (Mayfield et al., 2007) (Fig. 1B, C). Root lengths of 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 were also comparable with that of wild-type roots after 8 d of growth (Fig. 1B, C). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Shorter root lengths of 14-3-3μ-1 compared with wild-type root lengths. After 8 d of growth, 14-3-3μ-1 exhibited shorter roots than wild-type (A). The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates in constant light. The average root lengths after 8 d of growth were measured (B). The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 and phyB were ∼30% and ∼70% of the wild-type root length, while other lines were equal in root length to wild-type (B). Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared to wild-type using a t test (B). The root lengths of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and the wild type were measured daily in order to get a time-course of root lengths (C). 14-3-3μ-1 exhibited shorter roots that consistently increase in the deviation from wild-type root lengths through 8 d of growth. Error bars represent standard error (B, C).The root growth results for 14-3-3μ-1 were in stark contrast to the results for 14-3-3υ insertion mutants. Two separate T-DNA insertion alleles for 14-3-3υ showed wild-type root lengths under constant light conditions. CO also exhibited wild-type root length, while phyB had a slightly decreased root length (Fig. 1B). The time-course of root length was studied to determine if there was a particular time point that 14-3-3μ-1 root length begins to deviate from that of the wild type and Res-mu, or the two alleles of 14-3-3υ. Root lengths were measured daily over 8 d of growth (Fig. 1C). 14-3-3μ-1 exhibited an overall slower increase in root length throughout the entire 8 d compared with the wild type, with no particular day characterized as a specific point of separation of 14-3-3μ-1 from the wild-type root length. After day 2, when the difference in root length is measurable, the 14-3-3μ-1 root length begins to lag behind, and remain at a slower and constant growth rate, while wild type, Res-mu, and the 14-3-3μ alleles accelerate in growth rate. The decrease in root length of 14-3-3μ-1 is not due to altered nitrate reductase activity The 14-3-3 proteins interact with nitrate reductase (NR), as part of the NR inactivation process (Bachmann et al., 1996; Moorhead et al., 1996). In fact, of the 14-3-3 isoforms tested, 14-3-3υ is the third most effective at inactivating nitrate reductase (the 14-3-3μ isoform was not tested in the study) (Bachmann et al., 1996). Because of the 14-3-3 protein association with nitrate reductase inactivation, it was possible that the loss of 14-3-3μ protein resulted in overactive nitrate reductase. Overactive nitrate reductase protein, in combination with nitrate-rich media, could have resulted in a reduced need for root elongation since the roots had adequate nitrate levels available. In order to factor out nitrate reductase activity as the cause of 14-3-3μ-1 decreased root length, plants were grown on nitrate-free media using ammonium-citrate as the only nitrogen source. The 14-3-3μ-1 root lengths were 40% of the wild type, when grown on nitrate-free media for 14 d (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online), indicating that increased nitrate reductase activity was not the major factor for shorter 14-3-3μ-1 roots. Differential root length of 14-3-3μ-1 can be partly attributed to the photosensory pathway The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants 14-3-3μ-1, 14-3-3υ-1, and 14-3-3υ-2 all exhibit reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition under narrow-bandwidth red light during early development (Mayfield et al., 2007), similar to PHYB and PHYB-associated protein mutants (Neff and Chory, 1998; Huq et al., 2000). In order to test if 14-3-3μ-1 exhibits light-dependent deviations in root length, as does phyB, the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were grown alongside phyB and the wild type under three separate light intensities: full-light (60–70 μmol m−2 s−1), low-light (5 μmol m−2 s−1), and dark growth conditions. A CO mutant, co, was also included in all of the altered light condition experiments because CO is a binding partner of 14-3-3 proteins and is associated with 14-3-3-mediated red-light signalling (Mayfield et al., 2007). Seeds were planted on vertical plates and exposed to light for 1 h to promote germination, then transferred to full-light, low-light, or dark chambers. Root lengths were measured after 8 d (Fig. 2A, B). Under dark conditions, 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, co, and phyB roots were similar in length to the wild-type roots. 14-3-3μ-1 roots were slightly shorter than wild-type roots when grown in dark and low light conditions. 14-3-3μ-1 roots were ∼80% and ∼68% of wild-type root length in darkness and low light, respectively. By contrast, 14-3-3μ-1 roots were ∼25% of wild-type root length when grown in full-light conditions. As light intensity growth conditions decreased, 14-3-3μ-1 and Res-mu root lengths became more comparable (Fig. 2C). Res-mu root lengths were comparable with the wild type in all three light conditions. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab The influence of 14-3-3μ-1 root lengths by different light intensities. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates in dark (A) and low-light (B) conditions for 8 d and root lengths were measured. The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were ∼77% and ∼68% of the wild-type roots in dark and low-light conditions, respectively. Root lengths of 14-3-3μ-1 and Res-mu were compared as a % of wild-type root lengths when grown in three conditions: full light, low light, and dark (C). Res-mu roots were equal to wild-type root lengths in all treatments. The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were more comparable to wild-type lengths as the light conditions decreased in intensity. Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using a t test (A, B). 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutant roots develop increased numbers of chloroplasts during early development Roots experiencing prolonged light exposure exhibit greening resulting from chloroplast development (Whatley, 1983). PHYB is a positive regulator of chloroplast development in Arabidopsis roots (Usami et al., 2004). Due to similarities of 14-3-3μ-1 and phyB in the influence on root length by light intensity, the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were assayed for root chloroplast development along with the wild type, Res-mu, co, and phyB. Plants were grown on vertical agar plates under constant light conditions for 5 d. Roots of the 5-d-old plants were viewed with a fluorescent microscope. The roots were illuminated with blue light (488 nm) and viewed through a long pass filter in order to view the red autofluorescence of chlorophyll. A large number of chloroplasts were visualized within the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co (Fig. 3A). Wild-type and Res-mu roots developed chloroplasts, but in smaller numbers compared with the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co. The roots of phyB did not develop any observable chloroplasts under white light. The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 had the most dramatic increase in chloroplast number. The co, 14-3-3υ-1, and 14-3-3υ-2 roots had slightly fewer chloroplasts than 14-3-3μ-1. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Increased numbers of chloroplasts in the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co after 5 d of growth. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates for 5 d under constant light. Roots were illuminated with a blue light and visualized through a GFP long pass filter with a fluorescent microscope (A). The roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co contained more chloroplasts, which autofluoresce as a red colour. Pictures of roots from each line were cropped to equal sizes and the red tonal levels were measured with the RGB Measure Plus plug-in of the ImageJ program (B). The red tonal levels were higher for 14-3-3μ-1, 14-3-3υ1, 14-3-3υ-2 and co roots compared with the wild type. Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using a t test (B).The red channel level within the frame of each photograph was also quantified (Fig. 3B). Photo frames of equal size, exposure, and colour adjustment were taken of 4–6 roots from each line. The red channel tonal levels of each photo frame were quantified using the RGB Measure Plus plug-in of the ImageJ software package. Quantification of the red light tonal levels showed that the average red tonal level for the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co were higher than the wild type or Res-mu. T-tests confirmed that red tonal levels of 14-3-3μ-1, 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, and co root pictures were statistically higher than the wild-type levels (α=0.0000, 0.0067, 0.0127, and 0.0011, respectively). The photo frames of phyB roots contained statistically lower red tonal levels than the wild type, as confirmed by a t test (α=0.0253). The dramatic increase in chloroplasts in 14-3-3μ-1 roots was also examined with confocal microscopy. Wild-type and 14-3-3μ-1 plants were vertically grown for 5 d under full light conditions (60–70 μmol m−2 s−1), and root sections were observed to determine the distribution of chloroplasts (Fig. 4). The DIC images illustrated that the roots were of the same developmental age, with cells of comparable size, in the wild-type and 14-3-3μ-1 plants (Fig. 4A, D). Fluorescent images of the wild type and 14-3-3μ-1 showed that while the plastid size is comparable for each plant, the quantity of plastids in the 14-3-3μ-1 roots is around 2-fold that of the wild type (Fig. 4B, E). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Confocal microscopy of plastid distribution in the roots of wild-type (WT) and 14-3-3μ-1. The left hand panel shows an Arabidopsis seedling; the region of root presented in the right hand panels is indicated with a white box. (A, D) The fluorescing plastids merged with the corresponding DIC image. (B, E) The fluorescing plastids alone. (C, F) The overlay of images (A)+(B) and (D)+(E), respectively. Narrow-bandwidth red or blue light influence both root length and the numbers of chloroplasts in the roots Root lengths were also assayed from plants grown on vertical agar plates for 8 d under narrow-bandwidth red (25 μmol m−2 s−1) or blue (50 μmol m−2 s−1) light (Fig. 5). The 14-3-3μ-1 roots were ∼65% or ∼60% of the length of wild-type roots in red or blue light conditions, respectively. 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 roots were similar in length to wild-type roots when grown under blue light, but shorter when grown under red light. The 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 roots were ∼83% and ∼86% of the length of wild-type roots, respectively. The differences in root lengths of red-light-grown 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 were confirmed to be statistically different by t test (αα=0.0003 and 0.0050, respectively). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Root lengths of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants are influenced by red and blue light. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates under constant red or blue light conditions for 8 d and root lengths were measured. The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were ∼65% and ∼59% of wild-type roots in red and blue light conditions, respectively. The roots of the 14-3-3 υ T-DNA insertion mutants were similar in length to wild-type roots when grown under blue light, but 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 were ∼83% and ∼86% of wild-type roots in red light conditions, respectively. Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using a t test.Root chloroplast development can be influenced by growth under different wavelengths of light (Usami et al., 2004). When grown in dark or low light conditions, roots from none of the lines studied developed observable chloroplasts (data not shown). The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, co, phyB, Res-mu, and the wild type were also grown under narrow-bandwidth red or blue light to test whether these wavelengths influence root chloroplast development differently among the lines. Plants were grown for 5 d under red or blue light and then the roots were assayed for chloroplasts (Fig. 6). As previously published (Usami et al., 2004), blue light stimulated more root chloroplast development than red light. Furthermore, blue light stimulated more chloroplast development in the roots than white light. The roots of blue-light-grown 14-3-3μ-1 developed a higher number of chloroplasts than any of the other lines (Fig. 6A). Quantification of red tonal levels confirmed that 14-3-3μ-1 roots contain higher red tonal levels than both the wild type and Res-mu (Fig. 6B). The red tonal level of blue light grown 14-3-3μ-1 roots was statistically higher than that of wild-type or Res-mu roots as confirmed by t test (α=0.0012 and 0.0323, respectively). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Red and blue light influence the numbers of chloroplasts in the roots. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates for 5 d under constant red or blue light. Roots were illuminated with a blue light and visualized through a GFP long pass filter with a fluorescent microscope (A, C). All of the lines developed increased numbers of chloroplasts when grown under blue light compared with white light, but 14-3-3μ-1 roots contained higher numbers of chloroplasts than the other lines (A). When grown under red light, the roots of 14-3-3μ-1 and co were the only lines that developed high enough numbers of chloroplasts to be visualized with a fluorescent microscope (C). Pictures of roots from each line were cropped to equal sizes and the red tonal levels were measured with the RGB Measure Plus plug-in of the ImageJ program (B, D). When grown under blue light, the red tonal levels were higher for only 14-3-3μ-1 roots compared with the wild type (B). When grown under red light, the red tonal levels were equal for all lines measured (D). Although chloroplasts could only be visualized for 14-3-3μ-1 and co roots, the differences in tonal levels were not enough to be detected by the RGB Measure Plus program. Error bars represent standard error and asterices indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using a t test (B, D).Out of the lines grown under red light, 14-3-3μ-1 and co were the only sets that developed noticeably visible chloroplasts in the roots (Fig. 6C). The small number of chloroplasts in the 14-3-3μ-1 and co roots was not enough to raise the red tonal level of either mutant to a significant difference from that of wild-type roots (Fig. 6D).",
    "discussion": "Discussion This study characterizes several novel functions of 14-3-3 proteins in root growth and chloroplast development. The 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutants exhibited altered root lengths and chloroplast numbers in the roots. The phenotypes exhibited by the 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutants could all be influenced by growth conditions altered in light intensity or wavelength. The 14-3-3 υ T-DNA insertion mutants exhibited altered root lengths in red light and also had altered numbers of chloroplasts in the roots. Most of the root development phenotypes exhibited by these 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants can be attributed to deficiencies in the photosensory system. The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were only ∼25% as long as the roots of the wild type after 8 d of growth under constant light (Fig. 1B). However, the roots of 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 are the same length as the wild type after 8 d under constant light. The 14-3-3 μ protein is therefore an important factor in root growth, while 14-3-3 υ does not have an observable effect on root length under constant white light. The differences in root length in 14-3-3μ-1 are influenced by light intensity (Fig. 2). The root length of 14-3-3μ-1 was more comparable to wild-type roots when grown in the dark, compared with plants grown in full-light conditions (Fig. 2A). Under low-light conditions, the 14-3-3μ-1 root length percentage compared with the wild-type root length was intermediate between the root length percentages under full-light and dark conditions (Fig. 2B, C). Along with reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition under narrow-bandwidth red light, phytochromes are implicated in root elongation and gravitropic response (Correll et al., 2003; Correll and Kiss, 2005). The PHYB mutant, phyB, exhibits significantly reduced root elongation rates compared with the wild type when grown in light, but does not exhibit this same reduced root elongation rate when grown in the dark (Correll and Kiss, 2005), which was also observed in this study (Figs 1, 2). The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were not the same length as wild-type roots in dark grown conditions. Because the roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were still shorter than wild-type roots in dark conditions, the difference in 14-3-3μ-1 root length cannot be solely attributed to deficiencies in light signalling. Future studies will identify additional light-influenced and other developmental differences in 14-3-3μ-1 roots. Further phenotypic similarity between the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and phyB was noticeable under narrow-bandwidth red light conditions (Fig. 5). The roots of phyB grown under red light grow similarly to when they are grown in dark conditions (Correll and Kiss, 2005) as also seen in Figs 2 and 5. This similarity in root lengths under red light and dark conditions was also true for the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants. The root lengths of 14-3-3μ-1 were ∼8 mm after 8 d of growth in both red light and dark conditions. The root lengths of 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 were ∼10 mm after 8 d of growth in both red light and dark conditions. Further similarity to phyB, the root lengths of 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 were comparable with the wild type when grown in dark conditions, but shorter when grown under narrow-bandwidth red light. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants also exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition under red light in the first 4 d of growth (Mayfield et al., 2007). 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 grown under narrow bandwidth red light also exhibit a more vertical directional growth habit than the wild type (Mayfield et al., 2007), similar to phyB (Liscum and Hangarter, 1993; Poppe et al., 1996; Robson and Smith, 1996). Under blue light, 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 root lengths were comparable with wild-type, but 14-3-3μ-1 still exhibited shorter roots (Fig. 5). Wild-type root lengths were ∼36% longer when grown under blue light compared with dark conditions. 14-3-3μ-1 root lengths were ∼17% longer when grown under blue light in comparison to dark conditions. The difference in 14-3-3μ-1 root length when grown in the dark compared with blue light was less distinct than comparing the difference in root length of light- and dark-grown 14-3-3μ-1, indicating that 14-3-3μ-1 is slightly deficient in blue light signalling, a phenotype that is similar, but not as strong as in cry1 mutants (Canamero et al., 2006). Hypocotyl elongation inhibition is similar for 14-3-3μ-1 and wild-type plants grown under narrow bandwidth blue light (Mayfield et al., 2007). Although 14-3-3 μ was not found to be associated with blue light signalling in the hypocotyl during early development, these root length data indicate that 14-3-3 μ is associated with blue light signalling in the roots during early development. The association of 14-3-3 proteins with blue light has also been seen in broad bean, where the blue light photoreceptor, PHOT1, was identified as a client protein of 14-3-3s (Kinoshita et al., 2003). The roots of 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co exhibit increased chloroplast numbers, or greening, after 5 d of growth on vertical agar plates, while phyB roots exhibit decreased chloroplast numbers (Fig. 3). The development of chloroplasts in the roots can be influenced by both light intensity and different wavelengths of light. Dark-grown plants do not develop enough chloroplasts for detectable levels of root greening, while higher numbers of chloroplasts are developed in the roots of plants grown under blue light than plants grown under red light (Usami et al., 2004). Low-light-grown plants of all lines studied also did not develop enough chloroplasts for visualization in the roots, indicating that a threshold level of light is required for chloroplast development in the roots. Root greening under red light conditions is primarily induced by PHYB signalling, whereas, under blue light conditions, root greening is mainly induced by CRY1 and CRY2 signalling (Usami et al., 2004). However, phyAphyB mutants are deficient in blue-light-induced chloroplast development, indicating that phytochromes are also important for blue light induced chloroplast development in the roots (Usami et al., 2004). Under blue light, 14-3-3μ-1 exhibited a quantifiable increase in root greening (Fig. 6B), indicating that 14-3-3 μ regulation of chloroplast development in the roots is partly associated with blue light signalling. Differences seen in both root length and greening under blue light will be evaluated in future studies, especially in the potential for 14-3-3 association with CRY1 and its role in root length and greening (Usami et al., 2004; Canamero et al., 2006). The increased chloroplast numbers in the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co indicated that 14-3-3 proteins and CO are negative regulators of chloroplast development in the roots. No quantifiable difference in root greening was detected in the roots of any of the lines grown under red light (Fig. 6D), although 14-3-3μ-1 and co were the only lines to develop high enough numbers of chloroplasts to be visualized with a fluorescent microscope (Fig. 6C). Additional work is necessary to further characterize 14-3-3 μ or CO as co-regulators of chloroplast development in the roots via red-light signalling. In fact, this is the first report implicating CO with root development, however, CONSTANS-LIKE3 (COL3) is associated with root development (Datta et al., 2006). Although PHYB has not been identified as a protein binding partner of 14-3-3 proteins, phytochromes are regulated by phosphorylation, and the association of PHYB with several phosphorylation events presents many situations of possible 14-3-3 protein involvement (Kim et al., 2004). In addition, PHYB and PHYA induce phosphorylation of such proteins as PKS1 and PIF3 (Fankhauser et al., 1999; Al-Sady et al., 2006). This study presents novel roles of 14-3-3 proteins in root and chloroplast development, as well as new roles of CO in chloroplast development. Transcription levels of CO are increased in early development upon irradiance of 4-d-old dark-grown seedlings with a far-red light treatment (Tepperman et al., 2001), but a function for CO in early development has not been defined. In fact, the increase in chloroplast development in roots is the first reported phenotype for co in early development. The activity of CO in chloroplast development may only be as a component of the activity of CO and the COL proteins. The present reverse-genetic study establishes novel, isoform-specific roles of 14-3-3 proteins in Arabidopsis root and chloroplast development. 14-3-3 proteins are increasingly recognized as a major node in the plant interactome, an interaction node that includes CO and other signalling molecules related to light responses (AIMC, 2011). Further, the roles of 14-3-3 proteins in root and chloroplast development are controlled by light intensity or wavelength. 14-3-3 TDNA insertion mutants also exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation and time to flowering, compared with the wild type (Mayfield et al., 2007). Both the hypocotyl elongation and flowering timing phenotypes are, in part, due to 14-3-3 binding/influence of CO (Mayfield et al., 2007). The study presented here also characterizes CO as a potential factor in root chloroplast development of Arabidopsis during early development.

For instance, 14-3-3 proteins influence the photosensory system through interactions with Constans (CO) protein. 14-3-3 associations with the photosensory system were further studied in this investigation using 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants to study root and chloroplast development. The 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutant, 14-3-3μ-1, had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root length could be influenced by light intensity. The 14-3-3 ν T-DNA insertion mutants also had shorter roots, but only when grown under narrow-bandwidth red light. Five-day-old 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutants all had increased root greening compared with the wild type, which was influenced by light wavelength and intensity. However, beyond 10 d of growth, 14-3-3μ-1 roots did not increase in greening as much as wild-type roots. This study reveals new developmental roles of 14-3-3 proteins in roots and chloroplasts, probably via association with the photosensory system. Keywords: Chloroplast, photosensory system, plastid, 14-3-3 proteins, root developmentIntroduction The 14-3-3 proteins are predominantly known for their ability to bind certain phosphorylated proteins to complete phosphoregulation events (Ferl, 1996). In plants, 14-3-3 protein binding activity includes the regulation of key metabolic enzymes, such as nitrate reductase and sucrose synthase (Bachmann et al., 1996; Toroser et al., 1998), and also the activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Olsson et al., 1998; Fuglsang et al., 1999; Svennelid et al., 1999; Ottmann et al., 2007). Throughout eukaryotes, 14-3-3 proteins are known to bind a multitude of different proteins and, specifically, participate in a wide array of signal transduction regulatory events. Multicellular eukaryotes contain multiple 14-3-3 protein family members, or isoforms. The number of 14-3-3 isoforms can vary per organism, but Arabidopsis contains 13 expressed 14-3-3 genes (Wu et al., 1997; Rosenquist et al., 2001; Sehnke et al., 2006). The 14-3-3 proteins throughout eukaryotes share sequence homology within the core region of the protein sequence, but sequences of individual isoforms diverge in the amino- and carboxy-terminal tails. The importance of multiple 14-3-3 isoforms per organism remains to be elucidated, however, reverse genetic studies analysing knockout or knock down mutants continue to identify specific roles of individual 14-3-3 isoforms (Su et al., 2001; Sugiyama et al., 2003; Mayfield et al., 2007; Purwestri et al., 2009). In Arabidopsis, 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were utilized to find association of the 14-3-3 isoforms μ and υ with both light sensing during early development and time of transition to flowering (Mayfield et al., 2007). Red light-grown 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants exhibit decreased hypocotyl elongation inhibition (Mayfield et al., 2007) reminiscent of, but not identical to Phytochrome B (PHYB) mutants (Koornneef et al., 1980). The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants also flower later in long-day conditions (16 h of light), but not in short-day conditions (8 h of light) (Mayfield et al., 2007). In rice, the opposite phenotype occurs when manipulating expression of the 14-3-3 isoform, GF14c (Purwestri et al., 2009). Over-expression of GF14c results in delayed flowering, while knockout results in early flowering. These 14-3-3 mutant phenotypes indicate a role in light-related signalling for these particular 14-3-3 isoforms. The relationship of 14-3-3 proteins with light signalling is further supported by the observation that 14-3-3 proteins bind the blue light photoreceptor Phototropin 1 (PHOT1) (Kinoshita et al., 2003) and the flowering timing regulation protein Constans (CO) (Mayfield et al., 2007), as well as downstream targets such as Flowering Timing (FT) and Self-Pruning (SP) (Pnueli et al., 2001). Light perception is broadly important for phototropic responses, time of flowering, and root development. For example, Red and far-red light influence the directional growth of roots. Roots of some plants, such as maize and rice, grow horizontally in the dark, but grow downward when the plants are irradiated with red or far-red light from above (Takano et al., 2001; Lu et al., 1996). In addition, there is copious expression of photoreceptors in the roots (Pratt and Coleman, 1974; Somers and Quail, 1995; Toth et al., 2001), suggesting a functional relevance for photoreceptors in root development. Root hair development is enhanced by light and mediated by phytochromes (De Simone et al., 2000a, b). Further, both Phytochrome A (PHYA) and PHYB regulate red-light-induced root hair development while far-red-induced root hair development is regulated by PHYA alone (De Simone et al., 2000a). Photoreceptors also control chloroplast development in roots that are exposed to light. Prolonged exposure of plant roots to light stimulates the development of chloroplasts in the roots (Whatley, 1983). Chloroplast development in the roots is stimulated by red and blue light, with cryptochrome 1 and 2 (CRY1 and CRY2) as the primary regulators of blue light-stimulated chloroplast development and PHYB as the primary regulator in red light (Usami et al., 2004). This study utilizes the previously described T-DNA insertion mutants of 14-3-3 μ and υ to examine the roles of individual 14-3-3 isoforms in root elongation and chloroplast development, that are controlled by the photosensory system. A 14-3-3μ knockdown mutant containing a T-DNA insertion within the promoter of 14-3-3μ, 14-3-3μ-1 (Mayfield et al., 2007), exhibited shorter roots whose lengths were influenced by various light intensities. The 14-3-3υ knockout T-DNA insertion mutants, 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 (Mayfield et al., 2007), each contain a T-DNA insertion within the 14-3-3υ coding region and also had shorter roots than the wild type, but only when grown under narrow bandwidth red light. In addition, the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and CO mutants (co) (co-1; Redei, 1962; Koornneef et al., 1991) exhibited an increase in chloroplast numbers after 5 d of growth.Materials and methods Growth conditions of Arabidopsis seedlings Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized as previously described by Paul et al. (2001). Thirty to forty seeds of each line were planted onto 0.5× MS vertical plates, which consisted of 0.22% MS salts (Murashige and Skoog, 1962), 0.025% MES buffer, 0.5% sucrose, 0.1% 1000× MS vitamins (Murashige and Skoog, 1962), and 0.8% agar. Nitrate-free media were prepared as above, except that the MS salt mix was substituted for nitrogen-free MS salt mix (Product #MSP007; Caisson Laboratories, Logan, UT), 1 mM ammonium citrate was added and the media was adjusted to a pH of 6.5. After planting, the seed-containing plates were incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 48 h. The plates were then placed under the appropriate light conditions. Constant-light-grown seedlings were grown under a light bank emitting 60–70 μmol m−2 s−1 of light (two Cool White Sylvania bulbs and two Gro-Lux bulbs). Constant red light (630 nm at 25 μmol m−2 s−1), blue light (470 nm at 40 μmol m−2 s−1) or dark-grown plants were exposed to white light for 1 h, after the 48 h cold treatment, and placed under Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) or in the dark. Treatments included irradiation with specific fluence rates of red light (630 nm; Quantum Devices, Barneveld WI) or blue light (470 nm; Ledtronics Inc, Torrance CA), and a custom design used by Folta et al. (2005).Characterization of phyB mutants Seed stocks for the PHYB T-DNA insertion mutant lines Salk_022035 and Salk_069700 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The seeds were planted on wet Fafard Fine-germinating Mix soil and incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 3 d. The seeds were exposed to light for 1 h to promote germination, then placed under ∼20 μmol m−2 s−1 of narrow-bandwidth red light for 4 d. All seedlings were cleared from the soil that did not exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition. The remaining seedlings that did exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition were later screened for homozygous T-DNA insertion using PCR. A left border T-DNA specific primer (LBb1) and two, T-DNA flanking, PHYB gene-specific primers were used to identify lines that were homozygous for T-DNA insertion into the respective 14-3-3 genes. It is important to add that 100% of the lines, from both Salk_022035 and Salk_069700, selected as exhibiting reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition were identified as homozygous PHYB T-DNA insertion mutants. The phenotypes exhibited by Salk_022035 and Salk_069700 in this study were comparable between the two separate lines. In order to make the data easier to convey, only the phenotypic data of Salk_022035 were included in the results and discussion of this study.Root and chloroplast measurements Digital images of roots were captured using an Epson Perfection 3170 Photo scanner for further analysis. Root lengths were assessed by measuring root lengths of each Arabidopsis line of wild-type, Res-mu, and 14-3-3μ-1 with the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio Dental School (UTHSCSA) Image Tool software (http://ddsdx.uthscsa.edu/dig/itdesc.html). The root measurements collected were standardized and processed in Microsoft Excel.Visualization of Arabidopsis roots with a fluorescent microscope Roots were viewed with an Olympus BX51 fluorescent microscope coupled to an Evolution MP cooled charge-coupled device camera with Q-capture 2.60 software (Quantitative Imaging, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). Digital photos were taken through a 10× objective and captured with no binning. Regions identical in size were cropped from the digital images taken of roots from each Arabidopsis line. Slides were prepared by mounting the roots in water between a slide and cover slip.Visualization of Arabidopsis roots with a confocal microscope Roots from 5-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings were viewed with a confocal LSM5 Pascal Laser Scanning Microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The light source used was a helium neon laser emitting 543 nm light. The light emitted by the helium neon laser was filtered with a long pass filter resulting in a wavelength of 560 nm, similar to the conditions used to view rhodamine. Images were collected of the red fluorescing chloroplast, as well as Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) images to provide a reference for root size and shape.Quantification of the red tonal levels of Arabidopsis roots Four or more fluorescent microscope images of chloroplasts in root tissue were cropped in order to standardize the images to equal sizes using Adobe Photoshop. The standardized images were then processed with the RGB Measure Plus plug-in of Image J. Tonal levels recorded by the RGB Measure Plus plug-in were then processed with Microsoft Excel.Results 14-3-3μ-1 has shorter roots than wild-type Wild-type and 14-3-3μ-1 were grown on vertical MS media agar plates under constant light conditions and assayed for root lengths after 8 d of growth (Fig. 1). The roots of 14-3-3μ-1, co, and phyB were statistically shorter than wild-type levels (α=9.006×10−61, 0.0011, and 3.744×10−13, respectively). The 14-3-3μ-1 roots were only ∼25% of wild-type root length (Fig. 1A, B), although developmentally similar in the aerial tissue. Wild-type root length was restored by the reintroduction of 14-3-3μ in Res-mu, a 14-3-3μ-1 line that was complemented by the native 14-3-3 μ gene (Mayfield et al., 2007) (Fig. 1B, C). Root lengths of 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 were also comparable with that of wild-type roots after 8 d of growth (Fig. 1B, C). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Shorter root lengths of 14-3-3μ-1 compared with wild-type root lengths. After 8 d of growth, 14-3-3μ-1 exhibited shorter roots than wild-type (A). The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates in constant light. The average root lengths after 8 d of growth were measured (B). The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 and phyB were ∼30% and ∼70% of the wild-type root length, while other lines were equal in root length to wild-type (B). Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared to wild-type using a t test (B). The root lengths of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and the wild type were measured daily in order to get a time-course of root lengths (C). 14-3-3μ-1 exhibited shorter roots that consistently increase in the deviation from wild-type root lengths through 8 d of growth. Error bars represent standard error (B, C).The root growth results for 14-3-3μ-1 were in stark contrast to the results for 14-3-3υ insertion mutants. Two separate T-DNA insertion alleles for 14-3-3υ showed wild-type root lengths under constant light conditions. CO also exhibited wild-type root length, while phyB had a slightly decreased root length (Fig. 1B). The time-course of root length was studied to determine if there was a particular time point that 14-3-3μ-1 root length begins to deviate from that of the wild type and Res-mu, or the two alleles of 14-3-3υ. Root lengths were measured daily over 8 d of growth (Fig. 1C). 14-3-3μ-1 exhibited an overall slower increase in root length throughout the entire 8 d compared with the wild type, with no particular day characterized as a specific point of separation of 14-3-3μ-1 from the wild-type root length. After day 2, when the difference in root length is measurable, the 14-3-3μ-1 root length begins to lag behind, and remain at a slower and constant growth rate, while wild type, Res-mu, and the 14-3-3μ alleles accelerate in growth rate.The decrease in root length of 14-3-3μ-1 is not due to altered nitrate reductase activity The 14-3-3 proteins interact with nitrate reductase (NR), as part of the NR inactivation process (Bachmann et al., 1996; Moorhead et al., 1996). In fact, of the 14-3-3 isoforms tested, 14-3-3υ is the third most effective at inactivating nitrate reductase (the 14-3-3μ isoform was not tested in the study) (Bachmann et al., 1996). Because of the 14-3-3 protein association with nitrate reductase inactivation, it was possible that the loss of 14-3-3μ protein resulted in overactive nitrate reductase. Overactive nitrate reductase protein, in combination with nitrate-rich media, could have resulted in a reduced need for root elongation since the roots had adequate nitrate levels available. In order to factor out nitrate reductase activity as the cause of 14-3-3μ-1 decreased root length, plants were grown on nitrate-free media using ammonium-citrate as the only nitrogen source. The 14-3-3μ-1 root lengths were 40% of the wild type, when grown on nitrate-free media for 14 d (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online), indicating that increased nitrate reductase activity was not the major factor for shorter 14-3-3μ-1 roots.Differential root length of 14-3-3μ-1 can be partly attributed to the photosensory pathway The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants 14-3-3μ-1, 14-3-3υ-1, and 14-3-3υ-2 all exhibit reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition under narrow-bandwidth red light during early development (Mayfield et al., 2007), similar to PHYB and PHYB-associated protein mutants (Neff and Chory, 1998; Huq et al., 2000). In order to test if 14-3-3μ-1 exhibits light-dependent deviations in root length, as does phyB, the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were grown alongside phyB and the wild type under three separate light intensities: full-light (60–70 μmol m−2 s−1), low-light (5 μmol m−2 s−1), and dark growth conditions. A CO mutant, co, was also included in all of the altered light condition experiments because CO is a binding partner of 14-3-3 proteins and is associated with 14-3-3-mediated red-light signalling (Mayfield et al., 2007). Seeds were planted on vertical plates and exposed to light for 1 h to promote germination, then transferred to full-light, low-light, or dark chambers. Root lengths were measured after 8 d (Fig. 2A, B). Under dark conditions, 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, co, and phyB roots were similar in length to the wild-type roots. 14-3-3μ-1 roots were slightly shorter than wild-type roots when grown in dark and low light conditions. 14-3-3μ-1 roots were ∼80% and ∼68% of wild-type root length in darkness and low light, respectively. By contrast, 14-3-3μ-1 roots were ∼25% of wild-type root length when grown in full-light conditions. As light intensity growth conditions decreased, 14-3-3μ-1 and Res-mu root lengths became more comparable (Fig. 2C). Res-mu root lengths were comparable with the wild type in all three light conditions. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab The influence of 14-3-3μ-1 root lengths by different light intensities. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates in dark (A) and low-light (B) conditions for 8 d and root lengths were measured. The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were ∼77% and ∼68% of the wild-type roots in dark and low-light conditions, respectively. Root lengths of 14-3-3μ-1 and Res-mu were compared as a % of wild-type root lengths when grown in three conditions: full light, low light, and dark (C). Res-mu roots were equal to wild-type root lengths in all treatments. The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were more comparable to wild-type lengths as the light conditions decreased in intensity. Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using a t test (A, B).14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutant roots develop increased numbers of chloroplasts during early development Roots experiencing prolonged light exposure exhibit greening resulting from chloroplast development (Whatley, 1983). PHYB is a positive regulator of chloroplast development in Arabidopsis roots (Usami et al., 2004). Due to similarities of 14-3-3μ-1 and phyB in the influence on root length by light intensity, the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were assayed for root chloroplast development along with the wild type, Res-mu, co, and phyB. Plants were grown on vertical agar plates under constant light conditions for 5 d. Roots of the 5-d-old plants were viewed with a fluorescent microscope. The roots were illuminated with blue light (488 nm) and viewed through a long pass filter in order to view the red autofluorescence of chlorophyll. A large number of chloroplasts were visualized within the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co (Fig. 3A). Wild-type and Res-mu roots developed chloroplasts, but in smaller numbers compared with the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co. The roots of phyB did not develop any observable chloroplasts under white light. The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 had the most dramatic increase in chloroplast number. The co, 14-3-3υ-1, and 14-3-3υ-2 roots had slightly fewer chloroplasts than 14-3-3μ-1. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Increased numbers of chloroplasts in the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co after 5 d of growth. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates for 5 d under constant light. Roots were illuminated with a blue light and visualized through a GFP long pass filter with a fluorescent microscope (A). The roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co contained more chloroplasts, which autofluoresce as a red colour. Pictures of roots from each line were cropped to equal sizes and the red tonal levels were measured with the RGB Measure Plus plug-in of the ImageJ program (B). The red tonal levels were higher for 14-3-3μ-1, 14-3-3υ1, 14-3-3υ-2 and co roots compared with the wild type. Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using a t test (B).The red channel level within the frame of each photograph was also quantified (Fig. 3B). Photo frames of equal size, exposure, and colour adjustment were taken of 4–6 roots from each line. The red channel tonal levels of each photo frame were quantified using the RGB Measure Plus plug-in of the ImageJ software package. Quantification of the red light tonal levels showed that the average red tonal level for the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co were higher than the wild type or Res-mu. T-tests confirmed that red tonal levels of 14-3-3μ-1, 14-3-3υ-1, 14-3-3υ-2, and co root pictures were statistically higher than the wild-type levels (α=0.0000, 0.0067, 0.0127, and 0.0011, respectively). The photo frames of phyB roots contained statistically lower red tonal levels than the wild type, as confirmed by a t test (α=0.0253). The dramatic increase in chloroplasts in 14-3-3μ-1 roots was also examined with confocal microscopy. Wild-type and 14-3-3μ-1 plants were vertically grown for 5 d under full light conditions (60–70 μmol m−2 s−1), and root sections were observed to determine the distribution of chloroplasts (Fig. 4). The DIC images illustrated that the roots were of the same developmental age, with cells of comparable size, in the wild-type and 14-3-3μ-1 plants (Fig. 4A, D). Fluorescent images of the wild type and 14-3-3μ-1 showed that while the plastid size is comparable for each plant, the quantity of plastids in the 14-3-3μ-1 roots is around 2-fold that of the wild type (Fig. 4B, E).

The 14-3-3μ-1 roots were ∼65% or ∼60% of the length of wild-type roots in red or blue light conditions, respectively. 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 roots were similar in length to wild-type roots when grown under blue light, but shorter when grown under red light. The 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 roots were ∼83% and ∼86% of the length of wild-type roots, respectively. The differences in root lengths of red-light-grown 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 were confirmed to be statistically different by t test (αα=0.0003 and 0.0050, respectively). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Root lengths of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants are influenced by red and blue light. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates under constant red or blue light conditions for 8 d and root lengths were measured. The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were ∼65% and ∼59% of wild-type roots in red and blue light conditions, respectively. The roots of the 14-3-3 υ T-DNA insertion mutants were similar in length to wild-type roots when grown under blue light, but 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 were ∼83% and ∼86% of wild-type roots in red light conditions, respectively. Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using a t test.Root chloroplast development can be influenced by growth under different wavelengths of light (Usami et al., 2004). When grown in dark or low light conditions, roots from none of the lines studied developed observable chloroplasts (data not shown). The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, co, phyB, Res-mu, and the wild type were also grown under narrow-bandwidth red or blue light to test whether these wavelengths influence root chloroplast development differently among the lines. Plants were grown for 5 d under red or blue light and then the roots were assayed for chloroplasts (Fig. 6). As previously published (Usami et al., 2004), blue light stimulated more root chloroplast development than red light. Furthermore, blue light stimulated more chloroplast development in the roots than white light. The roots of blue-light-grown 14-3-3μ-1 developed a higher number of chloroplasts than any of the other lines (Fig. 6A). Quantification of red tonal levels confirmed that 14-3-3μ-1 roots contain higher red tonal levels than both the wild type and Res-mu (Fig. 6B). The red tonal level of blue light grown 14-3-3μ-1 roots was statistically higher than that of wild-type or Res-mu roots as confirmed by t test (α=0.0012 and 0.0323, respectively). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Red and blue light influence the numbers of chloroplasts in the roots. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates for 5 d under constant red or blue light. Roots were illuminated with a blue light and visualized through a GFP long pass filter with a fluorescent microscope (A, C). All of the lines developed increased numbers of chloroplasts when grown under blue light compared with white light, but 14-3-3μ-1 roots contained higher numbers of chloroplasts than the other lines (A). When grown under red light, the roots of 14-3-3μ-1 and co were the only lines that developed high enough numbers of chloroplasts to be visualized with a fluorescent microscope (C). Pictures of roots from each line were cropped to equal sizes and the red tonal levels were measured with the RGB Measure Plus plug-in of the ImageJ program (B, D). When grown under blue light, the red tonal levels were higher for only 14-3-3μ-1 roots compared with the wild type (B). When grown under red light, the red tonal levels were equal for all lines measured (D). Although chloroplasts could only be visualized for 14-3-3μ-1 and co roots, the differences in tonal levels were not enough to be detected by the RGB Measure Plus program. Error bars represent standard error and asterices indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using a t test (B, D).Out of the lines grown under red light, 14-3-3μ-1 and co were the only sets that developed noticeably visible chloroplasts in the roots (Fig. 6C). The small number of chloroplasts in the 14-3-3μ-1 and co roots was not enough to raise the red tonal level of either mutant to a significant difference from that of wild-type roots (Fig. 6D).Discussion This study characterizes several novel functions of 14-3-3 proteins in root growth and chloroplast development. The 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutants exhibited altered root lengths and chloroplast numbers in the roots. The phenotypes exhibited by the 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutants could all be influenced by growth conditions altered in light intensity or wavelength. The 14-3-3 υ T-DNA insertion mutants exhibited altered root lengths in red light and also had altered numbers of chloroplasts in the roots. Most of the root development phenotypes exhibited by these 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants can be attributed to deficiencies in the photosensory system. The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were only ∼25% as long as the roots of the wild type after 8 d of growth under constant light (Fig. 1B). However, the roots of 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 are the same length as the wild type after 8 d under constant light. The 14-3-3 μ protein is therefore an important factor in root growth, while 14-3-3 υ does not have an observable effect on root length under constant white light. The differences in root length in 14-3-3μ-1 are influenced by light intensity (Fig. 2). The root length of 14-3-3μ-1 was more comparable to wild-type roots when grown in the dark, compared with plants grown in full-light conditions (Fig. 2A). Under low-light conditions, the 14-3-3μ-1 root length percentage compared with the wild-type root length was intermediate between the root length percentages under full-light and dark conditions (Fig. 2B, C). Along with reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition under narrow-bandwidth red light, phytochromes are implicated in root elongation and gravitropic response (Correll et al., 2003; Correll and Kiss, 2005). The PHYB mutant, phyB, exhibits significantly reduced root elongation rates compared with the wild type when grown in light, but does not exhibit this same reduced root elongation rate when grown in the dark (Correll and Kiss, 2005), which was also observed in this study (Figs 1, 2). The roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were not the same length as wild-type roots in dark grown conditions. Because the roots of 14-3-3μ-1 were still shorter than wild-type roots in dark conditions, the difference in 14-3-3μ-1 root length cannot be solely attributed to deficiencies in light signalling. Future studies will identify additional light-influenced and other developmental differences in 14-3-3μ-1 roots. Further phenotypic similarity between the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and phyB was noticeable under narrow-bandwidth red light conditions (Fig. 5). The roots of phyB grown under red light grow similarly to when they are grown in dark conditions (Correll and Kiss, 2005) as also seen in Figs 2 and 5. This similarity in root lengths under red light and dark conditions was also true for the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants. The root lengths of 14-3-3μ-1 were ∼8 mm after 8 d of growth in both red light and dark conditions. The root lengths of 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 were ∼10 mm after 8 d of growth in both red light and dark conditions. Further similarity to phyB, the root lengths of 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 were comparable with the wild type when grown in dark conditions, but shorter when grown under narrow-bandwidth red light. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants also exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition under red light in the first 4 d of growth (Mayfield et al., 2007). 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 grown under narrow bandwidth red light also exhibit a more vertical directional growth habit than the wild type (Mayfield et al., 2007), similar to phyB (Liscum and Hangarter, 1993; Poppe et al., 1996; Robson and Smith, 1996). Under blue light, 14-3-3υ-1 and 14-3-3υ-2 root lengths were comparable with wild-type, but 14-3-3μ-1 still exhibited shorter roots (Fig. 5). Wild-type root lengths were ∼36% longer when grown under blue light compared with dark conditions. 14-3-3μ-1 root lengths were ∼17% longer when grown under blue light in comparison to dark conditions. The difference in 14-3-3μ-1 root length when grown in the dark compared with blue light was less distinct than comparing the difference in root length of light- and dark-grown 14-3-3μ-1, indicating that 14-3-3μ-1 is slightly deficient in blue light signalling, a phenotype that is similar, but not as strong as in cry1 mutants (Canamero et al., 2006). Hypocotyl elongation inhibition is similar for 14-3-3μ-1 and wild-type plants grown under narrow bandwidth blue light (Mayfield et al., 2007). Although 14-3-3 μ was not found to be associated with blue light signalling in the hypocotyl during early development, these root length data indicate that 14-3-3 μ is associated with blue light signalling in the roots during early development. The association of 14-3-3 proteins with blue light has also been seen in broad bean, where the blue light photoreceptor, PHOT1, was identified as a client protein of 14-3-3s (Kinoshita et al., 2003). The roots of 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co exhibit increased chloroplast numbers, or greening, after 5 d of growth on vertical agar plates, while phyB roots exhibit decreased chloroplast numbers (Fig. 3). The development of chloroplasts in the roots can be influenced by both light intensity and different wavelengths of light. Dark-grown plants do not develop enough chloroplasts for detectable levels of root greening, while higher numbers of chloroplasts are developed in the roots of plants grown under blue light than plants grown under red light (Usami et al., 2004). Low-light-grown plants of all lines studied also did not develop enough chloroplasts for visualization in the roots, indicating that a threshold level of light is required for chloroplast development in the roots. Root greening under red light conditions is primarily induced by PHYB signalling, whereas, under blue light conditions, root greening is mainly induced by CRY1 and CRY2 signalling (Usami et al., 2004). However, phyAphyB mutants are deficient in blue-light-induced chloroplast development, indicating that phytochromes are also important for blue light induced chloroplast development in the roots (Usami et al., 2004). Under blue light, 14-3-3μ-1 exhibited a quantifiable increase in root greening (Fig. 6B), indicating that 14-3-3 μ regulation of chloroplast development in the roots is partly associated with blue light signalling. Differences seen in both root length and greening under blue light will be evaluated in future studies, especially in the potential for 14-3-3 association with CRY1 and its role in root length and greening (Usami et al., 2004; Canamero et al., 2006). The increased chloroplast numbers in the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co indicated that 14-3-3 proteins and CO are negative regulators of chloroplast development in the roots. No quantifiable difference in root greening was detected in the roots of any of the lines grown under red light (Fig. 6D), although 14-3-3μ-1 and co were the only lines to develop high enough numbers of chloroplasts to be visualized with a fluorescent microscope (Fig. 6C). Additional work is necessary to further characterize 14-3-3 μ or CO as co-regulators of chloroplast development in the roots via red-light signalling. In fact, this is the first report implicating CO with root development, however, CONSTANS-LIKE3 (COL3) is associated with root development (Datta et al., 2006). Although PHYB has not been identified as a protein binding partner of 14-3-3 proteins, phytochromes are regulated by phosphorylation, and the association of PHYB with several phosphorylation events presents many situations of possible 14-3-3 protein involvement (Kim et al., 2004). In addition, PHYB and PHYA induce phosphorylation of such proteins as PKS1 and PIF3 (Fankhauser et al., 1999; Al-Sady et al., 2006). This study presents novel roles of 14-3-3 proteins in root and chloroplast development, as well as new roles of CO in chloroplast development. Transcription levels of CO are increased in early development upon irradiance of 4-d-old dark-grown seedlings with a far-red light treatment (Tepperman et al., 2001), but a function for CO in early development has not been defined. In fact, the increase in chloroplast development in roots is the first reported phenotype for co in early development. The activity of CO in chloroplast development may only be as a component of the activity of CO and the COL proteins. The present reverse-genetic study establishes novel, isoform-specific roles of 14-3-3 proteins in Arabidopsis root and chloroplast development. 14-3-3 proteins are increasingly recognized as a major node in the plant interactome, an interaction node that includes CO and other signalling molecules related to light responses (AIMC, 2011). Further, the roles of 14-3-3 proteins in root and chloroplast development are controlled by light intensity or wavelength. 14-3-3 TDNA insertion mutants also exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation and time to flowering, compared with the wild type (Mayfield et al., 2007). Both the hypocotyl elongation and flowering timing phenotypes are, in part, due to 14-3-3 binding/influence of CO (Mayfield et al., 2007). The study presented here also characterizes CO as a potential factor in root chloroplast development of Arabidopsis during early development. Further work will be necessary to understand the mechanism of 14-3-3 control of both root and chloroplast development and how the association of 14-3-3 proteins and CO factors into these processes.Supplementary data Supplementary data can be found at JXB online.

    "title": "14-3-3 phosphoprotein interaction networks - does isoform diversity present functional interaction specification?",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3422896/",
    "abstract": "Abstract The 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as major phosphoprotein interaction proteins and thereby constitute a key node in the Arabidopsis Interactome Map, a node through which a large number of important signals pass. Throughout their history of discovery and description, the 14-3-3s have been described as protein families and there has been some evidence that the different 14-3-3 family members within any organism might carry isoform-specific functions. However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting that the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-specific expression. This situation has led to a currently unresolved question – does 14-3-3 isoform sequence diversity indicate functional diversity at the biochemical or cellular level? We discuss here some of the key observations on both sides of the resulting debate, and present a set of contrastable observations to address the theory functional diversity does exist among 14-3-3 isoforms. The resulting model suggests strongly that there are indeed functional specificities in the 14-3-3s of Arabidopsis. The model further suggests that 14-3-3 diversity and specificity should enter into the discussion of 14-3-3 roles in signal transduction and be directly approached in 14-3-3 experimentation. It is hoped that future studies involving 14-3-3s will continue to address specificity in experimental design and analysis.

Throughout their history of discovery and description, the 14-3-3s have been described as protein families and there has been some evidence that the different 14-3-3 family members within any organism might carry isoform-specific functions. However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting that the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-specific expression. This situation has led to a currently unresolved question – does 14-3-3 isoform sequence diversity indicate functional diversity at the biochemical or cellular level? We discuss here some of the key observations on both sides of the resulting debate, and present a set of contrastable observations to address the theory functional diversity does exist among 14-3-3 isoforms. The resulting model suggests strongly that there are indeed functional specificities in the 14-3-3s of Arabidopsis. The model further suggests that 14-3-3 diversity and specificity should enter into the discussion of 14-3-3 roles in signal transduction and be directly approached in 14-3-3 experimentation. It is hoped that future studies involving 14-3-3s will continue to address specificity in experimental design and analysis. Keywords: Arabidopsis, GRF, plant, subcellular localization, 14-3-3 isoform specificityINTRODUCTION The 14-3-3s are a family of regulatory proteins that is present in all eukaryotes and involved in protein interactions mediating signal transduction pathways. Numerous pathways and processes rely on the 14-3-3 interactions to regulate key metabolic points (e.g., Aitken et al., 1992; Ferl, 1996; Finnie et al., 1999; Fulgosi et al., 2002). The conservation of 14-3-3 structure among eukaryotes speaks to their essential nature, yet the divergence into so many isoforms in each of these species suggests an intricate network of roles for these proteins (e.g., Rosenquist et al., 2000; Roberts and de Bruxelles, 2002; Sehnke et al., 2002b). Most plants have about a dozen 14-3-3 genes that provide sequence and functional diversity potentially leading to specialized structures and functions within the various members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. That diversity can be enlarged by selective phosphorylation of 14-3-3s at several known sites across the protein, sites that are variously retained among the isoforms. The purpose of this paper is to examine the evolutionary and biochemical diversity of 14-3-3s and question whether this diversity has any intrinsic biochemical, cellular, or physiological significance; then present approaches to answer that question. 14-3-3s are by far the major, most numerous phosphoprotein interaction proteins in plants (e.g., Ferl, 1996, 2004; Ferl et al., 2002; Chevalier et al., 2009; Gokirmak et al., 2010; Denison et al., 2011). This fact alone puts 14-3-3s among the most important interaction nodes in the Arabidopsis interactome (Braun et al., 2011). The 14-3-3s interact with phosphorylated peptide sequences through sequence-specific motifs RSxpSxP, RSxxpSxP, and YpT, among others (Aitken et al., 1992; Dubois et al., 1997a; Yaffe et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 2001; Ferl et al., 2002; Shen et al., 2003). The phosphorylated serine or threonine forms both hydrogen and ionic bonds with highly conserved residues found in the basic binding pocket of the 14-3-3 protein. In vertebrate isoform 14-3-3τ, these residues are located at K49, R56, and R127 (Muslin et al., 1996). Binding can also occur with non-phosphorylated sequences, such as GHSL (Andrews et al., 1998) and WLDLE (Petosa et al., 1998). These diverse binding sequences permit the 14-3-3 proteins to participate in a wide range of phosphorylation-based signaling pathways. Some examples in plants include red light signaling, immunity-associated cell death, abiotic stress response, ATP synthase activity in both mitochondria and chloroplasts, and nitrate reductase activity regulation (Ferl et al., 1994; Jarillo et al., 1994; Bunney et al., 2001; Pozuelo et al., 2001; Folta et al., 2008; Oh et al., 2010). We consider that, in many signaling systems,14-3-3s serve to complete the phosphorylation-based, signal-induced changes in their client proteins, and that the binding of 14-3-3s finalize the signaling event by enabling a change in client conformation, activity, localization, or the association of the client within a larger protein complex (Sehnke et al., 2002a; Figure 1). This consideration, that 14-3-3s should serve major phosphor-signaling roles, helps set the stage for the major hypothesis under discussion in this paper. With so many potential roles and many 14-3-3 family members what range of specificities among family members might be expected with regard to biological functions of 14-3-3s? FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Function of 14-3-3s. The basic 14-3-3-mediated regulation of client activity is a two-step process whereby the target protein is first phosphorylated by a specific kinase. This creates a recognition site for the binding of dimeric 14-3-3 proteins, which can have a number of different effects on client activity. Each 14-3-3 monomer can bind to different sites on the same client protein or each can bind different client proteins. 14-3-3s may themselves be phosphorylated (as indicated by “?”) although the effects on client binding are not well understood.14-3-3 PRIMARY SEQUENCE EVOLUTION The 14-3-3s are considered to be a well conserved protein family, yet some areas of the proteins have undergone diversification. The number of isoforms present differs among species. Thirteen expressed isoforms are present in Arabidopsis, seven are present in many animals, and two are present in yeast (Ferl, 1996; van Heusden et al., 1996; DeLille et al., 2001; Aitken, 2006; Schoonheim et al., 2007; Li and Dhaubhadel, 2011). Amino acid identity is conserved to a reasonable degree within the entire family across species and across most of the protein (Comparot et al., 2003; Bridges and Moorhead, 2005; Lottersberger et al., 2006; Zannis-Hadjopoulos et al., 2008; see Figure 2). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab The degree of amino acid similarity across all 13 Arabidopsis 14-3-3s is displayed graphically. Amino acid sequences were aligned in Vector NTI and generated with a resolution window of five residues. The nine α-helices are shown below (after Sehnke et al., 2002a).Sequence alignment of the thirteen 14-3-3 proteins from Arabidopsis allows the visualization of regions of that have been conserved or have diverged over evolutionary time. These regions can also be overlain onto a structural model to help predict regions that may be important structurally or functionally (Figure 3). Although there are regions that show high conservation across all isoforms, it is apparent that there are certain sub-groupings of isoforms that show greater sequence similarity to each other. Conservation patterns can be logically classified along well-supported evolutionary lineages which may imply a specialization-driven divergence (Ferl et al., 1994). This potentially suggests that selection pressures are present in the family due to their involvement in specialized function and complex formation (Rosenquist et al., 2001), but this is a suggestion based on divergence branching pattern and not on the acquisition or loss of known functionalities. Plant 14-3-3s can be divided into two main subgroups, the ε and non-ε groups (DeLille et al., 2001; Sehnke et al., 2002b; Yao et al., 2007; Li and Dhaubhadel, 2011). The non-ε group can be further subdivided, with four of these groupings occurring in the last 170 million years (Piotrowski and Oecking, 1998; Vision et al., 2000; Rosenquist et al., 2001). Additionally, the ε group tends to have deep branching in all plant species (Piotrowski and Oecking, 1998), suggesting that ε isoforms retain ancestral protein function (Wang and Shakes, 1996). The presence of multiple isoforms, however, leads to the question of functional differences. Are these different isoforms performing different cellular functions? Or do these proteins act redundantly as backups to perform these vital functions? FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Amino acid conservation among the 13 Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms. The Amino acid conservation among the 13 Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms is mapped onto the 14-3-3 protein structure (based on that of human 14-3-3τ/θ) using ConSurf (Landau et al., 2005; Ashkenazy et al., 2010; top panel). Color-coding indicates the amount of change each position has undergone over evolutionary time. Views are angled with perspectives shown in lower left corners, with monomers in orange and blue. Residue conservation is highest in the client binding channel, which is exposed in the left image. The consensus 14-3-3 amino acid sequence is color-coded according to the degree of conservation determined with ConSurf (bottom panel). Residues predicted to have roles in 14-3-3 structure (conserved and buried) and function (conserved and exposed) are annotated below the sequence. Exposed and buried residues were determined using a neural network algorithm. Residues for which there was insufficient data (present in less than 10% of isoforms) are indicated in yellow. Positions of the nine alpha-helices are indicated below the sequence.Specificity among 14-3-3s does not appear to be associated with phylogenetic speciation. After consideration of 14-3-3 evolution in plants, there emerges no compelling case for specificity that is based on evolutionary lineages alone. There has been no evolutionary premise that has led to the discovery of specific biochemical interaction or cellular function among plant 14-3-3s. There are divergences that track evolutionary change, certainly, but no specific lineages have been associated with specific functions.14-3-3 PHOSPHORYLATION Phosphorylation events having a physiologically relevant impact on 14-3-3s have been identified in both plants and animals under certain conditions, but there is not yet a cohesive model for the role phosphorylation plays in defining functional specificity. However, known phosphorylation sites are not universally conserved in 14-3-3s, making phosphorylation an event that could mark certain isoforms for certain functionalities. A number of phosphorylation events been reported in mammalian 14-3-3s at S58, S64, S132, S185, T233, and Y179 (Aitken et al., 1995; Dubois et al., 1997a,b; Furlanetto et al., 1997; Megidish et al., 1998; Gringhuis et al., 2005). Some of these sites are not conserved across all isoforms allowing potential for specific effects. For example, the S58 phosphorylation site is not conserved in the 14-3-3σ and 14-3-3τ isoforms. 14-3-3β and 14-3-3ζ appear to be the only 14-3-3s phosphorylated at S185 in vivo even though two other isoforms contain a serine residue at this site. Furthermore, this phosphorylation event has only been detected in brain and not in other tissues (Aitken et al., 2002). The first report of phosphorylation of a plant 14-3-3 protein was the demonstration that 14-3-3ω can be phosphorylated in vitro (Lu et al., 1994). Since then, a number of large scale phospho-proteomics studies have identified plant 14-3-3 proteins in their screens using mass spectrometry, including gravity responses in Arabidopsis (Barjaktarovic et al., 2009) and seed development in oilseed rape (Agrawal and Thelen, 2006). A recent study in Arabidopsis found evidence for phosphorylation of several isoforms at different sites at the C-terminus of the proteins. This is a region of very low sequence conservation (Figures 2 and 3) providing the potential for phosphorylation to affect 14-3-3s in an isoform-specific manner (Sugiyama et al., 2008; Reiland et al., 2009). Three Arabidopsis 14-3-3s (χ, κ, ψ) were identified as being phosphorylated by SnRK2.8 in roots at S93/95 (Shin et al., 2007). This serine residue is conserved across only five of the Arabidopsis isoforms. Tyrosine phosphorylation has also been reported in Maize and Arabidopsis 14-3-3s (Olivari et al., 2000; Giacometti et al., 2004). Few studies have examined the functional effects of these 14-3-3 modifications in plants. Phosphorylation events that do have a biochemical impact on 14-3-3s have primarily been characterized in mammals. Some of these phosphorylation sites have shown to be conserved in plant 14-3-3s and may play a similar functional role (Aitken et al., 1995; Dubois et al., 1997a,b; Furlanetto et al., 1997; Megidish et al., 1998; Gringhuis et al., 2005). For instance, the phosphorylation of human 14-3-3ϖ at T233 has been shown to modify the ability of 14-3-3s to interact with clients by introducing a conformational change of the C-terminus (Dubois et al., 1997b; Kubala et al., 2004; Obsilova et al., 2004; Clokie et al., 2009). In plants there are three sites within the C-terminal tail (helix 9) which are phosphorylated during seed development in Brassica (Agrawal and Thelen, 2006) and, as mentioned above, there is also evidence for phosphorylation at the C-terminus in Arabidopsis (Sugiyama et al., 2008; Reiland et al., 2009). Based on the data from mammals, it can be predicted that this may affect the conformation of the C-terminus and client binding. Phosphorylation of human S58 affects client binding, and compromises the ability to dimerize (Powell et al., 2003; Woodcock et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2006; Jagemann et al., 2008; Sluchanko et al., 2011; Woodcock et al., 2010). S58 corresponds to residue S62 in Arabidopsis 14-3-3ω. This site is conserved across all Arabidopsis isoforms with the exception of 14-3-3κ and 14-3-3λ. In plants, phosphorylation at Y179 and S185 affects client binding, although the mechanism and their effects on 14-3-3 structure is not known (Tsuruta et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2005; Sunayama et al., 2005; Yoshida et al., 2005; Barry et al., 2009). Potential tyrosine phosphorylation of the 14-3-3s at Y137 decreases binding to the H+-ATPase (Olivari et al., 2000; Giacometti et al., 2004). Although the Y179 and Y137 sites are conserved across all isoforms, S185 is not present in 14-3-3μ. Since phosphorylation sites are not conserved across all isoforms, differential phosphorylation could lead to increased functional specificity within 14-3-3s (Moreira et al., 2008). This leads to a situation where discussion of 14-3-3s must accommodate and acknowledge not only the primary sequence difference among 14-3-3s but also the differential phosphorylation among 14-3-3s (see Figure 4). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab 14-3-3 Phosphorylation sites. 14-3-3 residues that are phosphorylated in animal or plant 14-3-3s and that are also conserved in Arabidopsis 14-3-3 protein sequences are listed.

(Reiland et al., 2009; Sugiyama et al., 2008; Mayank et al., 2012).14-3-3 DIMERIZATION The 14-3-3 isoforms are present in cells as some combination of homodimers or heterodimers. Dimer formation in 14-3-3s involves interactions within residues of the first four alpha helices (Gardino et al., 2006). In any cell containing multiple isoforms, if all isoforms could dimerize freely with each other, this would allow for many different combinations. It has been argued that this could dilute out any functional differences between or among isoforms (Wilker et al., 2005). However, there is evidence, particularly from the mammalian literature, that fully random dimerization is not always the case and that there are preferences for certain dimer combinations. This potential is provided by the fact that helices 1 through 4 do contain some of the areas of higher sequence variation among isoforms. It has been suggested that homodimers and heterodimers could have different functions (Aitken, 2002). In mammalian systems, studies have shown that two isoforms in particular, 14-3-3σ and 14-3-3ε, show a preference to form either homodimers or heterodimers. In one study, immunoprecipitation of endogenous 14-3-3σ from a human cancer cell line showed that it was present primarily as homodimers whereas 14-3-3β formed heterodimers to a much greater extent (Wilker et al., 2005). It is thought that this preference of 14-3-3σ to homodimerize allows it to bind isoform-specific clients and play a specific role in the DNA damage checkpoint that is not shared with other isoforms (Wilker et al., 2005). Conversely, 14-3-3ε has been detected only as heterodimers when expressed in vivo (Chaudhri et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2006). Studies of the crystal structure of the mammalian isoforms have helped to explain why this preference for homodimers or heterodimers may exist. There are a number of variable amino acids in the dimer interface between isoforms. Subsequently, the number of stabilizing salt bridges in the dimer interface varies between one and three depending on the isoform. In the case of the 14-3-3σ homodimer, there are three salt bridges and also extra interactions between aromatic ring side chains, stabilizing the homodimers (Benzinger et al., 2005; Wilker et al., 2005; Gardino et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2006). If 14-3-3ε was to form a homodimers, there would only be one stabilizing salt bridge and therefore may be the reason why ε prefers to form heterodimers (Gardino et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2006). The two yeast 14-3-3s also show an inclination to form heterodimers rather than homodimers (Chaudhri et al., 2003). There is also evidence for preferences for particular heterodimer partners in mammals. Specificity was shown in the dimer partners co-immunoprecipitated with myc-tagged 14-3-3ε or 14-3-3γ expressed in neuronal cells which did not appear due to the amount of total endogenous isoform present (Chaudhri et al., 2003). In plant systems, the issues surrounding dimerization are even less resolved, particularly in vivo. Our early studies looking at the in vitro dimerization potential of different recombinant Arabidopsis 14-3-3s hinted that there may be some differences between isoforms in their preferences for dimer partners. In that study, although all four Arabidopsis isoforms tested were able to form all combinations of both homodimers and heterodimers in yeast-2-hybrid, there were interesting results when different isoform pairs were renatured in vitro and analyzed by native gels, which suggested there are differences in the ratios of homodimers to heterodimers present between different isoform pairs (Wu et al., 1997). In another Arabidopsis study, TAP tagged 14-3-3ω expressed in cell suspension cells was detected as both homodimers as well as heterodimers with nine other isoforms suggesting that in cells this isoform is able to form dimer partners with multiple isoforms (Chang et al., 2009). In contrast, in a yeast two-hybrid study with cotton 14-3-3s, none of the six isoforms were able to form homodimers, yet heterodimers were detected. Selectivity was also shown in the particular heterodimer partners of the isoforms (Zhang et al., 2010). Dimerization between different 14-3-3s is, therefore, likely to be variable and depend at least on the intrinsic affinities among 14-3-3s isoforms. Further, dimerization is likely to be variable within cell types, depending on the expression levels and sub-cellular localization of different isoforms, in addition to the phosphorylation status of isoforms. As mentioned above, phosphorylation of 14-3-3s can inhibit dimerization (Woodcock et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2006). There is evidence in mammals that monomeric 14-3-3s may be functional too and may have different client binding properties to the dimers (Shen et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2003; Han et al., 2010). This leads to the conclusion that dimerization status, particularly the degree of heterodimerization, must be accounted for in any model of 14-3-3 isoform specificity.STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE Given the clear presence of diversity in the primary structure of 14-3-3s in plants, and further given that this primary sequence diversity can be amplified by phosphorylation and by heterodimerization, what are the biochemical, cellular, and physiological impacts of that diversity? Is the diversity an evolutionary collection of biochemically irrelevant genetic drift or is the diversity a reflection of true functional specification within the 14-3-3 family? With multiple isoforms present in any cell, the potential for dilution through dimerization, and with the common theme of interaction with certain phosphorylated peptides, it is difficult to construct obvious modes of isoform functional specificity. Our theory, however, is that true cellular and biochemical functional specificity does indeed exist among members of the 14-3-3 family. Disproving specificity as a hypothesis would be difficult, as lack of data cannot constitute proof of the hypothesis as being false. Therefore, our formally stated null hypothesis would be that no functional specificity exists among 14-3-3s. Rejection of this null hypothesis would be accomplished by any clear observations of specific function between or among 14-3-3 isoforms, which would then support our broader theory of specificity among 14-3-3s. In general, we posit that certain 14-3-3s in a given cellular context – and only those 14-3-3s – will have specific interactions that are not shared with other 14-3-3s, and as a result, certain 14-3-3s will have functional phenotypes revealed by mutation. Data are emerging from the literature in support of this notion. As a particular outcome for developing tests of the hypothesis, we posit that multiple 14-3-3s may be present in equal concentrations within a cell, yet each may biochemically interact with different clients and each may therefore have different cellular functions and localizations. Data from the literature and some primary data are presented in support of this notion. Full consideration of all factors suggests that it is possible that restricted groups of isoforms may have interactions and functions that are shared within that group. Members of a certain evolutionary branch would be one example of a group with potential shared specificities. 14-3-3s phosphorylated at a certain residue might also constitute a functionally specific group. And it is also possible that some biochemical and cellular functions could be shared by all isoforms. But the main idea of the theory is that out of the family of conserved, dimerizing 14-3-3s within a plant cell, certain isoforms or isoform groups do have certain specific biochemical interactions and functions.ELEMENTS OF THE ISSUE In order to address the theory and set up observational tests of the null hypothesis, we present data of functional redundancy that would fail to reject the null hypothesis, and also present observations of specificity that appear to reject the null hypothesis, thereby supporting the theory of specificity. Note that the theory of specificity does not explicitly deal with cell-specific expression of 14-3-3s, though this is an important overall component of 14-3-3 roles. It is certainly possible that developmental specificity of expression could present certain 14-3-3s with prominent roles in certain tissues, regardless of the specificity at the cellular or biochemical level. We therefore discuss briefly just how much tissue-specific expression of 14-3-3s might exist, then we examine redundancy and specificity at the cellular and biochemical levels as these levels do address directly the questions of functional specificity among protein isoforms. EXPRESSION SPECIFICITY In mammals, early 14-3-3 literature reported differences in the distribution of isoform transcripts in different regions of the brain by in situ hybridization, and also in other mammalian tissues by northern blot analysis (Watanabe et al., 1993, 1994). The difference in expression between brain structures is also supported by data from microarray studies in mice which show14-3-3γ to have by far the highest expression of any isoform in hippocampus. Conversely, the hypothalamus shows very low 14-3-3γ expression compared to the other isoforms, with 14-3-3β showing the highest expression levels followed by 14-3-3θ/τ (Rangel et al., 2009; Kim, 2012; Nijnik et al., 2012; Wefers et al., 2012). 14-3-3σ in particular shows notable differences in tissue expression compared to the other isoforms as it has only been detected in epithelial cells (Leffers et al., 1993). 14-3-3σ has received significant attention due to its proposed role as a tumor suppressor and thought to be linked to the exit of cells from the stem cell compartment of epithelia to become differentiated (Hermeking, 2003). As described in the dimerization section above, this specialized role may be due to its unique structural characteristics, not shared with other isoforms. In plants, early reports showed that Arabidopsis 14-3-3χ is differentially expressed in tissues by analysis of promoter activity and in situ hybridization (Daugherty et al., 1996). 14-3-3ω shows relatively high expression in flowers compared to leaves and stems by semi quantitative RT-PCR analysis, in contrast to 14-3-3κ and 14-3-3λ which show fairly even expression across these tissues (Sorrell et al., 2003). One isoform in particular, 14-3-3ι, shows a distribution more restricted to flowers hinting that it may play a specialized role here (Rosenquist et al., 2001). This is supported by microarray data from a number of studies which shows the 13 isoforms show a fairly similar expression pattern across tissues (Dinneny et al., 2008; Griffiths et al., 2011), with the exception of 14-3-3ι where transcripts are almost completely restricted to closed flower buds (Hennig et al., 2004; Figure 5). It should be noted that in situ hybridization and promoter fusion studies give an impression of greater cell specificity than observed by large scale microarray studies of tissues or organs. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Representative charts showing similarity in the 14-3-3 isoform genes expression pattern across different plant tissue in Arabidopsis thaliana based on selected microarrays expression data from ArrayExpress database. The experiment IDs in ArrayExpress database are provided in the chart title. Gene expression data was analyzed for only untreated, wt, Colombia cultivar plants. Y axis raw expression units relative to UBQ11 (At4g05050). Data from E-MTAB-1009 and E-GEOD-30096 was used to plot 14-3-3 isoform genes expression level across whole shoots, hypocotyls, and roots as well as root zones. The distance in the legend defines the distance from the root tip (A). The two independent experiments were analyzed, E-GEOD-5526 and E-MEXP-695 to plot 14-3-3 isoform genes expression level across reproductive tissues: siliques, closed flower buds, and open flowers were included. The asterisk indicates the higher 14-3-3 iota isoform expression level exclusively in closed flower buds (B). Notes: GRF (λ)/GRF4 (φ) label: GRF1 (λ alias GF14 λ; At4g09000), and GRF4 (φ alias GF14 φ; At1g35160) share same probe 255079_s_at on A-AFFY-2 - AffymetrixGeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]. As other _s_at probes (_s indicating Similarity) this probe represents a set with all probes common among multiple transcripts within a gene family, in this particular case chi and phi therefore both genes GF14 PHI and CHI could be found as annotated for the same probe. All other 14-3-3 members have unique probe IDs on ATH1-121501 arrays (_at individual probe).Rice 14-3-3 isoforms shows differences in expression across tissues and this pattern is different between isoforms (Chen et al., 2006; Yao et al., 2007; Purwestri et al., 2009). Interestingly, in one study the Os14-3-3-C isoform, which showed the most evenly high expression across all tissues studied, was also the most successful isoform in complementing deletion mutants of the 14-3-3 homologues in yeast (see below). This led the authors to speculate that isoforms such as Os14-3-3-C, which show ubiquitous expression across all tissues, may play very general and fundamental roles in rice. On the other hand, isoforms like Os14-3-3-G, which are unable to rescue the yeast 14-3-3 knockout, and which shows a more restricted tissue distribution, may play unique roles in response to specific conditions or developmental stages (Yao et al., 2007). A similar variation in tissue distribution between isoforms exists in cotton (Shi et al., 2007), soybean (Zhang et al., 2010; Li and Dhaubhadel, 2011), and broad bean (Emi et al., 2001). Vf14-3-3a shows higher expression in guard cells compared to the three other isoforms. It was proposed therefore that Vf14-3-3a may have a higher affinity for binding to the H+-ATPase than Vf14-3-3b, another isoform that is expressed in guard cells (Emi et al., 2001).EVIDENCE FOR REDUNDANCY Redundancy in 14-3-3 function can be examined from several perspectives. One perspective is physiological and can be approached by experiments with genetic mutations or TDNA knockouts in plants. The other perspective is biochemical, which can be examined by assays of direct biochemical interaction in vitro. Physiological redundancy One key observation in support of redundancy would be the lack of observable phenotype in a 14-3-3 TDNA knockout. In Arabidopsis, early studies indicated that several different 14-3-3 TDNA insertion mutants had no observable phenotype at all. Further, several combinations of 14-3-3 TDNA insertions apparently had no observable phenotype (Krysan et al., 1996, 1999), allowing for the continued debate over the extent of 14-3-3 functional redundancy in plants (Comparot et al., 2003; Ferl, 2004; Chevalier et al., 2009). There are also examples of different isoforms being involved with the same physiological response. Several 14-3-3s are involved in drought-related processes, and specific 14-3-3 isoforms have been implicated at the protein level in drought-stress, where overexpression of different single isoforms, At14-3-3λ or ZmGF14-6, can enhance drought tolerance (Yan et al., 2004; Campo et al., 2012). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a knockout of one of the two 14-3-3 forms results in a viable line, while the double knockout is lethal, suggesting the two isoforms found in yeast are functionally redundant (Lottersberger et al., 2006, 2007; Zannis-Hadjopoulos et al., 2008). This simple observation strongly suggests that the yeast 14-3-3s are essentially redundant, even though the single mutants do exhibit some growth differentials. The yeast double 14-3-3 mutant can be rescued by four Arabidopsis isoforms (van Heusden et al., 1996; Sorrell et al., 2003) and a human isoform (Zannis-Hadjopoulos et al., 2008). This is a profound observation that suggests strongly that most, if not all, of the 14-3-3 interactions that are required in yeast are retained in the isoforms of Arabidopsis and humans. However, recent results suggest that this conclusion is not universal. The Os14-3-3-C isoform is much more successful in complementing yeast deletion mutant than Os14-3-3-G (Yao et al., 2007). While there may be basic or fundamental activities in yeast that can be supported by many isoforms from plants, it may not be universally true that all plant isoforms can complement yeast.Biochemical redundancy At the biochemical level there is evidence that 14-3-3 isoforms have overlapping client binding profiles. Multiple mammalian isoforms show a very similar sequence binding preference based on screens across peptide libraries (Yaffe et al., 1997; Muslin et al., 1996). Six mammalian isoforms can all bind Bad in vitro and are able to reduce the apoptotic effects of Bad on cells (Subramanian et al., 2001). In plants studies, three different Arabidopsis isoforms were able to activate the H-ATPase (Baunsgaard et al., 1998) and surface plasmon resonance has shown that three barley isoforms can bind a lipoxygenase enzyme with similar affinities (Holtman et al., 2000). While not exhaustive in their treatments across isoforms, these studies and other studies indicate that at the biochemical interaction level, there can be overlap and similarity among isoforms with regard to client affinities.EVIDENCE FOR FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICITY AMONG ISOFORMS Although data supporting 14-3-3 functional specificity in plants are few, any observed specificity for any 14-3-3 function would reject the formal null hypothesis of complete isoform redundancy. From the literature there are now several cases of individual 14-3-3 TDNA insertions conditioning an observable phenotype. The fact that any phenotype can be assigned to 14-3-3s argues for specificity from first principles. Given the wide distribution of 14-3-3 isoform expression (Figure 5) it is likely that most cells have 14-3-3s present in addition to the one that is knocked out, hence phenotypes for individual 14-3-3s argues for specificity at the cellular level. Moreover, there are also now a few comparative studies in which phenotypes are known to be conditioned by one 14-3-3 isoform but not another. Functional specificity revealed by TDNA mutations Functional diversity of plant 14-3-3s is widely documented, and includes primary metabolism, abiotic and biotic stress, light-mediated processes, hormonal signaling, and basic cell growth and division (reviewed in Aitken, 2002; Denison et al., 2011). However, discrete examples of isoform functional specificity revealed by individual TDNA mutations are now emerging. The Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms υ and μ are involved in light sensing and signaling (Mayfield et al., 2007). Mutant υ and μ plants flower later and exhibit long hypocotyls under red light, with little effect under blue or far-red light. The long hypocotyl phenotype is consistent with a role for 14-3-3υ and μ in phytochrome B signaling. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays indicate that 14-3-3υ and μ proteins physically interact with CONSTANS, a central regulator of the photoperiod pathway. Together, these data indicate a potential role for these specific 14-3-3 isoforms in affecting photoperiodic flowering via interaction with CONSTANS, possibly as integrators of light signals sensed through the phytochrome system. These observations set at least 14-3-3μ and 14-3-3υ apart as 14-3-3s individually capable of regulating of flowering time. However, even though both 14-3-3μ and υ affect flowering time, they are not themselves redundant with each other. In the first place, redundancy between 14-3-3μ and υ would preclude either one from having a flowering phenotype as an individual TDNA mutation. In addition, 14-3-3μ TDNA insertion mutants have a distinctive short root phenotype, a phenotype that is not present in 14-3-3υ TDNA insertions (Mayfield et al., 2012). This observation suggests that functional specificity is likely context dependent. In a demonstration of remarkable specificity that is likely dependent on cellular context, the Arabidopsis κ and λ isoforms differentially affect Phot2 signaling in guard cells. κ and λ are closely related isoforms on a well-supported, separate evolutionary branch within the non-ε group. κ and λ differ by only a few amino acids in primary sequence, yet λ is required for normal stomatal opening by Phot2 while κ insertion mutations have no effect (Tseng et al., 2012). This observation suggests that in certain very specialized cell types, in this case the guard cells of the stomata, very specific requirements for certain specific 14-3-3 do exist (see also below).Biochemical specificity Plants have shown variation among isoforms in their affinity for specific client proteins. In Arabidopsis, recombinant constructs of 14-3-3 ω, χ, υ, φ, and ψ were comparatively tested for their ability to interact with phosphorylated nitrate reductase from spinach leaves, demonstrating drastically different levels of interaction (Bachmann et al., 1996). Different levels of biochemical inhibition of nitrate reductase have also been shown (Lambeck et al., 2010, 2012). Recombinant 14-3-3s have different affinities for H-ATPase (Rosenquist et al., 2000) and those affinities are not in the same relative order as described for nitrate reductase interactions. In addition, yeast two-hybrid studies in barley show differences in interaction levels for clients (Bornke, 2005; Schoonheim et al., 2007) and barley isoforms differ in their ability to inhibit NR or regulate K+ channels (Sinnige et al., 2005a,b). Six cotton 14-3-3s showed specificity in target binding in yeast two-hybrid study (Zhang et al., 2010). These studies do not necessarily stand in contrast to those studies cited above in which biochemical redundancy was demonstrated. Taken together, it is likely that there is a range of biochemical interaction affinities among isoforms, with isoforms demonstrating similar affinities for certain peptides or protein clients while also demonstrating specific affinities for some peptides and protein clients.Subcellular localization as a measure of specificity Subcellular localization can be a powerful indicator of 14-3-3 specificity among isoforms. The localization of a given 14-3-3 could be viewed as being directed by two forces. One force is the intrinsic localization of the individual 14-3-3 itself due to signals present in the 14-3-3 sequence. 14-3-3s are known, for example, to contain a Nuclear Export Signal (NES), and that signal is thought to aid in the 14-3-3-mediated movement of transcription factors out of the nucleus (Graves et al., 2001; Brunet et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2004; Nishino et al., 2008). The other force influencing 14-3-3 localization would be the location of the client protein. Localization of the 14-3-3/client complex would be dependent upon not only the localization signals of the 14-3-3 but also on the localization signal of the client protein. If the 14-3-3 NES was the dominant localization force, 14-3-3s would be expected to be prominently cytosolic in their localization. To expand this discussion we consider two possible 14-3-3 localization notions. At one level, consider the number of potential interactions for a single given isoform. That isoform would have only one set of intrinsic signals, an intrinsic localization based on its own structure. The other forces determining localization of the 14-3-3 would be derived from its interacting client protein. Most estimates of potential 14-3-3 interacting proteins in any cell, based on the presence of the canonical 14-3-3 recognition sequences, range from hundreds to thousands (Sehnke et al., 2002a). If these interacting proteins actually occur and are distributed randomly among cell compartments (nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane, for example), the given 14-3-3 isoform should be broadly dispersed among cellular locations because of the many locations of its clients. Under such conditions of promiscuous client interaction, a specific subcellular localization of any given 14-3-3 would be very unlikely. However, there certainly are distinct 14-3-3 subcellular localizations that are tissue-specific and different among 14-3-3 isoforms in plants (Sehnke et al., 2002a; Maraschin et al., 2003; Paul et al., 2005; Campo et al., 2012). Further, disrupting the client interactions can influence the localization of specific 14-3-3s (Paul et al., 2005; Sabina et al., 2007). Thus any observable, limited, specific subcellular localization of a 14-3-3 supports the notion that the 14-3-3 is interacting with a specific subset of cellular proteins (see Figure 6). FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Distinctly different 14-3-3 localizations determined by confocal microscopy of Arabidopsis. Isoform-specific antibodies that have been directly labeled with either Alexa-488 or Alexa-568 and used for in situ labeling. 14-3-3 λ (green) predominates in the nucleus while 14-3-3 ε (red) predominates in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. A single longitudinal optical slice of a root tip is shown in (A). (B,C) Provide closer views of the boxed sections of the root in (A). The root tip (B) exhibits an even distribution of 14-3-3-λ and 14-3-3-ε throughout the cells, and a section father back in the root (C) exhibits a clear partitioning of 14-3-3-λ into the nucleus and 14-3-3-ε to the plasma membrane/cell wall. Guard cell subcellular localization of four GFP-tagged 14-3-3 isomers is shown in the bottom row: ε (D), κ (E), λ (F), and φ (G).At a second level, consider the potential interactions of two different 14-3-3 isoforms present in the same cell. If the two isoforms were interacting with the same clients, the two isoforms would be present in the same subcellular locales. However, isoform-specific immunocytochemistry demonstrates that individual 14-3-3s can and do partition themselves in different locations within the cell. Figure 6 illustrates the localization of 14-3-3χ and 14-3-3ε in a young Arabidopsis root. Both χ and ε are robustly expressed in roots (see Figure 5). Yet the localization patterns for χ and ε are distinctly different across the cells of the root tip (Figure 6A). In the central cells marked with the C box in Figure 6, χ is largely nuclear, while ε is largely associated with the plasma membrane or cell wall. This single observation has dramatic implications for the notion of isoform-specific functionality. Because χ and ε are in two separate and distinct locations, they cannot be extensively heterodimerizing with each other. If expressed equally and randomly dimerizing, χ and ε would be present in a ratio of 1:2:1 of χ homodimers:χ/ε heterdomers:ε homodimers. Therefore, two-third of the red and green signals would be combined into a yellow heterodimer signal. This is clearly not the case. In fact the majority of signal in these cells is distinctly green or red. Because χ and ε are in separate subcellular locales, they cannot be interacting with the same clients or subsets of clients unless the intrinsic localization signals of the 14-3-3s are distinct and direct the localization of the complex. Moreover, the fact of specific and limited localization of these isoforms suggests that in these cells, χ and ε are interacting with few, potentially unique, client proteins. In the root tip cells marked with the B box in Figure 6, χ and ε are almost evenly distributed with regard to subcellular localization. In these cells they could be heterodimerizing or they could be interacting with a large number of different clients individually. Regardless, this distribution suggests that at least these two isoforms have distinct roles in metabolic processes in the different root zones, and further, that those roles can change depending on specific cell function. Other specialized cell types exhibit isoform-specific distributions as well. Subcellular localization of specific 14-3-3s was also examined in plants transformed with GFP fusions of individual 14-3-3 isoforms. Subcellular differences among the GFP fusion lines were most apparent in specialized cell types, such as trichomes and guard cells (Paul et al., 2005). The guard cells provide a particularly striking example. 14-3-3ε-GFP is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, but diminished in the nucleus (Figure 6D). On the other hand, 14-3-3κ-GFP is almost exclusively nuclear (Figure 6E). 14-3-3λ-GFP is generally expressed at lower levels, but when it is found in guard cells, it is always localized to the edges that define the stomata (Figure 6F). This marked difference in the distribution of κ and λ was surprising given the similarity of the two isoforms, however, distinct functional roles for these two related isoforms has also been demonstrated with respect to Phot2-mediated processes, where it was shown that λ played a role in stomatal opening in response to blue light, but κ did not (Tseng et al., 2012). The distribution of 14-3-3φ-GFP is seen throughout the cell and nucleus, but is especially prominent along the cytoskeleton (Figure 6G). In fact, live imaging with confocal microscopy shows the GFP-tagged φ isoform moving rapidly along the fibers of the matrix, to and from the nucleus (Paul et al., 2005).MODEL AND THEORY FOR SPECIFICITY Data strongly support the theory of specificity in 14-3-3 functional interactions at the cellular level. Two major types of observations cleanly reject the null hypothesis that no specificity exists and that all 14-3-3s are functionally redundant; the presence of phenotypes for 14-3-3 insertion mutants and the differential subcellular localization of isoforms within a cell. Given the wide expression profiles of most plant 14-3-3 genes, it is likely that almost every cell in the plant has a fairly complex population of different 14-3-3 isoforms and that many cells contain many 14-3-3 isoforms. Therefore, the existence of phenotype(s) associated with individual 14-3-3 insertion mutations is strong evidence that the particular isoform plays an important role that is not entirely complemented by other 14-3-3s present in a cell. Earlier, general studies showing that some 14-3-3 insertion mutations displayed no phenotype are now being supplanted by specific studies of well characterized insertion mutations that do display phenotypes. Furthermore, cell biology observations define another element of specificity. Within a particular cell, different 14-3-3s can be found in distinct subcellular locations, demonstrating clearly that the different 14-3-3s cannot be interacting with all of the same clients and serving the same cellular function. Among many, the example of 14-3-3λ and 14-3-3κ is quite compelling and complete. These isoforms are closely related yet show differential localization and differential physiological function within the light signaling pathways of guard cells (Paul et al., 2005; Tseng et al., 2012). The statement that there can be specificity in 14-3-3 function within a cell is, however, a simplification of a larger and more complex model for 14-3-3 interactions and functions. A full model for 14-3-3s interactions must incorporate a quantitative appreciation for (1) the number of different 14-3-3s present in the cell of interest, (2) the concentrations of each isoform, (3) the heterodimerization affinity among the isoforms present, (4) the affinities for each of the isoforms for each client target protein in the cell, and (5) any modifications of the 14-3-3s. Given these complexities, it is perhaps remarkable that specificity does exist in 14-3-3 function. Redundancies in function also exist. Therefore, a complete model of 14-3-3 roles must also accommodate some pool of overlapping specificities and perhaps some completely redundant functions among isoforms. The 14-3-3 family of isoforms, dimers, and modified forms should be considered a complex and dynamic system, a system that should be addressed and better understood with each experiment. This will require comparative studies. Where possible, observations about a given 14-3-3 isoform should be compared and contrasted with other isoforms within the same experiment. This is a key element often missing in current 14-3-3 literature. With increasing TDNA mutations publically available, for example, contrasts in experiments should accompany statements of 14-3-3 roles, including data where no phenotype is observed in some mutation(s). Care should be taken to be specific in the description of isoforms in an experiment and conclusions drawn from one isoform should not be considered to be true for other isoforms until tested. The limits of reagents and databases should be taken into consideration. For example, the Affymetrix array does not list a probeset for 14-3-3φ, and the probeset for 14-3-3χ very likely hybridizes with both 14-3-3φ and χ, presenting a likely over estimate of 14-3-3χ expression. Similarly, proteomics peptide databases do not always properly distinguish among isoforms, and peptides can be identified being from a particular isoform when in fact that peptide can be from all members of an evolutionary group. And TDNA insertions can result in various levels of 14-3-3 expression at the protein level. Deeper understanding of the 14-3-3 families and their roles as individual isoforms will therefore require experiments that are comparative among isoforms and a refined approach that increases the ability to identify individual isoforms and isoform groups as experimental contrasts. The theory of 14-3-3 specificity predicts that, when properly monitored and experimentally contrasted, certain 14-3-3 isoforms have a function that is not present in other isoforms – even if that isoform is present in the same cell. This theory does not preclude that there will be examples of overlapping function, but it does state that some functions will be clearly distinct among isoforms. Other systems of isoform families have embraced this notion. For instance, mammalian Akt protein kinases are highly conserved and function in the regulation of a diversity of cellular functions. Yet phenotypic studies with knockout mice have demonstrated that the three isoforms that comprise this family play distinct roles in the regulation of cellular growth, glucose homeostasis, and neuronal development. This reverse genetics approach establishes that the functions of each Akt isoform do not wholly overlap, and demonstrates that isoform-specific signaling contributes to the diversity of Akt activities in mice (Gonzalez and McGraw, 2009). In Drosophila, the demonstration that lines deficient in one or the other of their two 14-3-3 genes were not fully functional lead to the discovery that D14-3-3ε plays a specific role in pole cell migration, a specific function that could not be rescued by 14-3-3 Leo (Tsigkari et al., 2012). Thus it is apparent that specificity in isoform families can be discovered and appreciated within an enabled and aware experimental context.Conflict of Interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.Acknowledgments The experiment work presented herein was supported by NASA grants NNX07AH27G and NNX09AL96G to Anna-Lisa Paul and Robert J.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background During medium- to long-duration spaceflights, real-time microgravity can increase the health risks of astronauts. In particular, the disruption of intestinal homeostasis is closely related to other health problems, and it is necessary to monitor related treatment strategies. Ginseng is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine often used to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), which are the bioactive components of ginseng, have been reported to regulate immune homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation. This study focused on the regulation of GTSs in intestinal homeostasis imbalance caused by microgravity.Methods A hindlimb suspension (HLS) rat model was established to evaluate the intestinal protective effects of GTSs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using RNA-Seq. RT-PCR was performed to further focus and verify these results. The gut microbiome composition was examined based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the short-chain fatty acids produced were further analyzed.Results We found that GTSs intervention effectively improved the intestinal injury caused by simulated weightlessness, including reducing the pathological damage, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing the levels of inflammatory factors. Moreover, GTSs treatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal immunity-related genes and remodeled the gut microbiota. In particular, GTSs significantly increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism-related bacteria, thereby increasing the level of propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid.Conclusion Our results revealed that GTSs improved intestinal microecological disorders and impaired immune function caused by the weightlessness simulation. The underlying mechanism may be related to the “intestinal immune -microbiota-metabolic” pathway. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the precise design and development of GTSs for space-health products.Keywords: ginseng total saponins, gastrointestinal microbiome, immunity, short-chain fatty acids, weightlessness simulation",
    "introduction": "Introduction Long-duration spaceflight missions face challenges due to a variety of factors, including high vacuum, intense radiation, and low magnitude of gravity. Microgravity exposure is the main difficulty that needs to be overcome in real time, which causes astronauts to be in sub-health for a long time, affecting flight tasks and physical fitness.1 Several studies have shown that microgravity is closely related to health problems such as immune system disorders, cardiovascular dysfunction, and skeletal muscle loss. Intestinal microecology plays an important role in mediating the decline in these functions.2 Under weightlessness conditions, the intestine directly suffers from structural damage caused by various stress factors, including disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbiota imbalance.3,4 Moreover, the gut also regulates immune function and affects signal transduction between the host and intestinal microorganisms by producing intestinal microbial metabolites such as SCFAs.5,6 Evidence from animal experiments has reported serious intestinal barrier damage under weightlessness simulation, including typical intestinal villi injury, downregulation of tight junction protein expression, cell apoptosis, and increased intestinal permeability.3 Similarly, shortened intestinal villi, shallower crypt depth, and reduced mucin production in intestinal epithelial cells were observed in spaceflight rats.7,8 Recent data also show that the fluctuation of intestinal flora caused by weightlessness will lead to the imbalance of the immune system and increase the risk of opportunistic infection. A study revealed that weightlessness caused change in the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes, which may lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines by activating pattern recognition receptors8. In addition, microbiota metabolites also participate in the pathological changes of the digestive system related to spaceflight stress and play a role in the body signal transduction. Evidence shows that long-duration space flight significantly changes the gastrointestinal microbiota and related microbial metabolites of astronauts.9 The exploration based on animal experiments has also identified changes in intestinal metabolome such as amino acids and short-chain fatty acids, which are related to immune dysfunction and intestinal flora disorders.5,6 Thus, it is necessary to monitor intestinal microecological disorders caused by weightlessness and to discover related protective strategies to ensure the health of astronauts. In recent years, natural ingredients derived from plants or food, with the advantages of mild antibacterial activity, reparative action, and low resistance to human drugs, have shown broad application prospects in regulating the intestinal microecological balance.10 As a perennial plant with homology of medicine and food, ginseng has been used for thousands of years in many countries to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), a bioactive compound in ginseng, is responsible for most of the immunological and pharmacological activities of ginseng.11 According to previous records, GTSs have health benefits in regulating intestinal homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-central nervous system diseases, and in maintaining immunity.12 In particular, the effects of GTSs on intestinal immune regulation and inhibition of inflammation have been confirmed.13 GTSs are also beneficial for increasing the diversity of the gut microbiota, enhancing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides) and reducing the production of pathogenic bacteria (iron-removing bacteria, Helicobacter pylori) to enhance host health. In addition, the monomeric constituents of ginseng (including ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1, Rk3, and Re) can remodel the composition of the intestinal flora or modulate flora metabolites, thereby causing different effects on the intestinal barrier function, immune function, and host homeostasis.14–17 Because of its beneficial effects, CHM Taikong Yangxin prescription, which contains ginseng, has been used to keep Chinese astronauts healthy during their flights. In a previous study, we explored the potential of GTSs to maintain the neurological subhealth of astronauts.18 However, the regulatory effect of ginseng on intestinal homeostasis under weightlessness conditions remains unclear, and the underlying mechanisms related to gut-brain interactions remain to be explored. Therefore, we used the hindlimb suspension (HLS) model to evaluate the potential and possible mechanisms of GTSs in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, which will help to expand the health effects of ginseng and provide novel understanding and treatment options for health problems, starting with intestinal homeostasis during space travel.",

Animals Specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats (200±20 g) were purchased from Beijing Charles River Experimental Animal Company [SCXK (Beijing, China) 2016–0006]. The animals were kept at a 12 h light/dark cycle environment with a humidity of 45–50% to acclimate for 5 days. All experiments were conducted according to the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care ( publication No.86–23, revised in 1996) and approved by the Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Animal Care and Use Committee [SYXK (Beijing, China) 2017–0020]. HLS Model Rats were randomly divided into three groups (n=6): control (CON), hindlimb suspension (HLS), and the HLS treated with GTSs. The HLS model was established based on previous reports.20 Briefly, the hindlimbs were attached to a separate device with tape and chain hooks to form a 30-degree head-down tilt for 28 days. The CON and HLS groups were administered the same volume of water or GTSs (200 mg/kg, ig) daily. Subsequently, feces were collected for 16s rDNA sequencing on day 25, and serum and intestinal tissues were collected for other analyses on the last day. Qualitative Analysis of Components in GTSs Ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionization source and a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-ESI-QqQ-MS/MS), which contained an AB Sciex LC-MS system QTRAP® 6500, was used for separation and quantification. The samples were eluted using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH Shield RP18 column (2.1 mm×50 mm, 1.7 µm particles). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (acetonitrile) and ran under the following program: 0~5 min, 10%~23% B; 5~15 min, 23%~35% B; 15~20 min, 35~48% B; 20~20.5 min, 48%~90% B; 20.5~21.5 min, 90% B; 21.5~23 min, 90%~10% B; 23~25 min, 10% B. The flow rate was set at 0.3mL/min, and the injection volume was 5μL. The column temperature was maintained at 30 °C, and the samples were stored at 4 °C throughout the analysis. Electrospray ion source (ESI) and MRM were performed in the negative mode using nitrogen as the drying agent. The curtain gas (N2) was 40 psi, the collision gas (N2) was 9 psi, and the spray voltage was 5500 V. The atomization temperature was 550 °C, atomization gas (ion source gas 1, N2) and auxiliary gas (ion source gas 2, N2) were used. N2) were both at 55 psi. The corresponding ion pairs and cone voltages are listed in Table S1. Histological Examination Fresh small intestinal tissue from the same part was rinsed with normal saline and fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution until analysis. H&E and AB-PAS staining were performed to observe the tissue pathology, inflammatory responses, and goblet cell hyperplasia. Flow Cytometry Analysis Mesenteric lymph nodes were prepared as single-cell suspensions and subsequently incubated with anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD4-APC, anti-CD8-PE, and anti-CD45-APC antibodies (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The stained cells were analyzed using a CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA). Real-Time PCR Gene expression levels were measured by real-time PCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from small intestinal tissue and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The primers used are listed in Table S2. Data were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method with GAPDH as the internal reference for normalization. Transcriptome Analysis of Small Intestinal Tissue Small intestine sections were collected from the Con and HLS groups and transcriptome sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq sequencer by Beijing Boyun Huakang Gene Technology Co., Ltd. Raw data from transcriptomic experiments were deposited in the  SRA database (BioProject ID: PRJNA944741). The raw reads were filtered, and the clean reads were mapped to the rat reference genome (rn6) using HISAT software. Gene expression was quantified by fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped values (FPKM), and the PossionDis algorithm was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs; log2(fold change) ≥1 and q value ≤0.001). DEGs were then subjected to GO functional annotation. RT-PCR analysis was performed to further screen the DEGs regulated by the GTSs. Primer sequences used are listed in Table S2. Gut Microbiota Structural Profiling Total DNA was isolated from rat fecal pellets by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Briefly, 1% agarose gel was used to monitor DNA concentration and purity. According to the concentration, DNA was diluted to 1 ng/μL by adding sterile water. MiSeq systems based on 16S rRNA genes were used to analyze the gut microbiota. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify specific V3-V4 variable regions using barcode and high-frequency primers. A agarose gel electrophoresis (2%) and AxyPrepDNA (Axygen Scientific Inc. USA) gel recovery kit was used to detect PCR products and recover PCR fragments. According to the preliminary electrophoresis results, QuantiFluor™-ST blue fluorescence quantitative system (Promega Company) was utilized to detect and quantify the products of PCR amplification. The samples were mixed in equal proportions and subjected to the Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, USA) to construct the libraries. The library was sequenced on a computer following a quality check performed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and a qubit. Raw data from 16S rRNA experiments were deposited in the  SRA database (BioProject ID: PRJNA941119). The library was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Paired-end reads from the original DNA fragments were merged using FLASH software. The sequences were analyzed using UPARSE Version 7.0, with the UPARSE-OTU and UPARSE-out ref algorithms. In-house Perl scripts were used to analyze the diversity values of alpha (within samples) and beta (among samples). An in-house Perl program was used to assign sequences to the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs). SCFAs Analysis Quantitative analyses were performed as previously described by our group. The fecal sample (~10 mg) was thawed on ice and 200 µL of 50% methanol was added to prepare the homogenate. After centrifugation (4°C13,000 rpm, 10 min), 8 µL of the supernatant was collected. 50% methanol (72 µL), 1M EDC (10 µL), 1M O-BHA (10 µL), and 500 nM Acetic Acid-1-13C (5 µL; IS) were mixed with the supernatant. Derivatization was performed at 25 °C for 1h. Subsequently, 600 µL dichloromethane was added for extraction and 400 µL of the lower organic phase was collected and dried at 37 °C. Finally, 200 µL of 50% methanol was added to the sample, re-dissolved, and centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was used to re-dissolve the sample. The supernatant was used for LC-MS analysis (AB Sciex LC-MS System QTRAP® 6500). Chromatographic separation was achieved using an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1mm×100mm, 1.8 µm) at 50°C with a typical flow rate (200 nL/min). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and isopropanol (solvent B). The linear gradient was set as follows: 85%–85% A (0.0 to 1.0 min), 85%–64% A (1.0 to 8.0 min), 64%–50% A (8.0 to 8.5 min), 50%–50% A (8.5 to 10.5 min), and 50%–85% A (10.5 to 15 min). Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed in the positive ion mode with an electrospray ion source (ESI) and MRM mode using nitrogen as the drying agent. The curtain gas (N2) was 35 psi, collision gas (N2) was 9 psi, and the spray voltage was 4500 V. The measured parameters for specific ion pairs are listed in Table S3. Statistical Analysis All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed GraphPad Prism 8 (La Jolla, CA, USA). Significant differences of multiple groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett post-hoc test or Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.",
    "results": "Results The Content of Eight Ginsenosides in GTSs Was Detected by UPLC-MS The MRM chromatograms of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rg1, Rg2, Rc, Rd, Re, and Rf from GTSs were optimized for quantitative analysis. The calibration curve of the eight compounds showed good linearity with the available standards (R2 > 0.99), and the lower limits of quantification for the ginsenosides ranged from 2.4414 to 312.5 ng/mL, indicating sufficient sensitivity for quantitative evaluation. As a result, It contained 258.89 mg/g Rb1, 65.77 mg/g Rb2, 12.87 mg/gRg1, 26.14 mg/g Rg2, 93.72 mg/g Rc, 90.90 mg/g Rd, 105.34 mg/g Re and 20.87 mg/g Rf (Figure S1). Effect of GTSs on Intestinal Injury of Simulated Weightlessness Rats As shown in Figure 1A, pathological analysis was performed to observe tissue damage. Compared to the CON group, obvious pathological damage occurred in the small intestine tissue of the HLS group, including typical small bowel villous atrophy, crypt inflammation, crypt dropout and crypt atrophy. However, GTSs effectively improved the villi/crypt ratio (Figure 1B) and alleviated the impaired intestinal symptoms.Mucin secreted by goblet cells is the first line of innate host defence. To confirm intestinal injury, we performed AB/PAS staining to evaluate the number of goblet cells (Figure 1A). In this study, significant goblet cell depletion and mucin reduction were observed in HLS group, which were reversed to varying degrees after GTSs treatment (Figure 1C and D). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Ginsenosides can improve the histopathological changes of HLS rats.

In AB-PSA staining, goblet cells, responsible for secreting acidic mucin, are stained blue. (B) Villus/crypt ratio of HE staining.(C) Numbers of goblet cells of AB-PAS staining.

Quantitative data were expressed as the mean ± SEM from 6 rats in each group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, compared with CON group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, compared with HLS group.Similarly, occludin and claudin, which are typical markers of tight junctions, were regulated by GTSs, were significantly increased after GTSs treatment (Figure 2A and B). The proportion of CD3+CD4+ T cells was significantly lower in the HLS group than that in the CON group, whereas the proportion of CD3+CD8+ T cells tended to increase (Figure 2C). GTSs regulated these changes close to normal levels, indicating that GTSs effectively restored the intestinal immune imbalance. Figure 2.

RT-PCR was performed to determine the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-7. The contents of TNF-α and IL-6 in small intestine were analyzed by ELISA kit. As shown in Figure 2D–E, GTSs treatment reduced the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in the HLS group. In conclusion, GTSs had a positive protective effect in rats with simulated weightlessness. Effects of Simulated Weightlessness and GTSs on Gut Function The small intestines of six rats were performed transcriptome in CON and HLS groups. Compared with the CON group, 660 genes were upregulated and 70 genes were downregulated in the HLS group. GO function enrichment analysis was performed to understand the biological processes of DEGs (Figure 3A). The results revealed that the downregulated genes were primarily associated with innate immune response. Upregulated genes are often found during the ion transmembrane transport. The top 40 differentially expressed genes were identified. The results showed that The levels of genes related to innate immunity (including Slfn4, Ly6e, Ifi2712, etc.) were significantly lower in the HLS group than in the CON group (Figure 3B). We performed RT-PCR analysis to validate the sequencing results and evaluate the therapeutic effects of GTSs. As shown in Figure 3C, HLS significantly decreased the expression of Isg15, Slfn4, Ly6e and Ifi27l2b, whereas the reduction in HLS rats were gradually reverted to normal levels after GTSs treatment.

Structure Modulation of GTSs on Gut Microbial Under Simulated Weightlessness We differentiated the data of each sample according to the barcode sequence, and the extracted data were saved in FASTQ format. The quality control data with reliable base calling are listed in Table S4. The rarefaction curve indicated that the amount of sequencing data obtained in this study was reasonable (Figure S2). Alpha diversity, based on Shannon’s analysis, was used to characterize the species diversity of the microbial communities. Strikingly, a sequential decrease in microbiota composition was observed in the HLS and GTSs groups (Figure 4A). However, there were differences in the relative abundance of dominant flora among the experimental groups, especially at the phylum and genus levels. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes dominated the fecal samples of all groups, and GTSs may have restored the relative abundance of these two species in rats subjected to weightlessness. Similarly, GTSs had modulatory effects on the dominant genera in the three groups, including Lactobacillus, Tumorcoccus, Oscillospira and All0baculum (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the Anosim test showed significant intergroup differences in bacterial community structure, and NMDS analysis was used to assess this change (Figure 4C). To further identify the most significant differential microbiota between the experimental groups, corresponding LEfSe analysis was performed (Figure 4D). The results showed that Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Jeotgalicoccus were the dominant bacteria in the model group, and their relative abundance was significantly reduced after GTSs intervention (Table S5). In addition, compared with the CON group, Lactobacillus, Lactobacillaceae and Bacilli were identified as the major contributing flora in the GTSs group. These results suggest that GTSs have a dual modulatory effect on the gut microbial composition and abundance in simulated weightless rats. KEGG function prediction revealed that GTSs may be involved in signaling molecules and interactions, energy metabolism, immune function, and the nervous system by affecting the intestinal flora (Figure 4E).

(C) β-Diversity analysis based on PCoA plot. (D) The cladogram generated from LEfSe analysis. (E) Distribution heatmap of microbiota. Six samples from each group were analyzed. GTSs Improves Short-Chain Fatty Acid Content in Simulated Weightless Rats Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and microbial metabolites have been proven to have beneficial effects on the intestinal barrier and inflammation.21 A reliable UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was established to measure the contents of four major SCFAs (acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid), which cumulatively accounted for 95% of the total SCFAs. The related figure and supporting data are presented in Figure S3 and Table S6, respectively. In addition to acetic acid, the contents of the other three SCFAs were significantly reduced in the HLS group, and GTS demonstrated the potential to restore SCFAs towards normal levels (Figure 5A–E). Correlation analysis was used to determine the contribution of the gut microbiota and SCFAS to the treatment of GTSs. In previous analyses, we found that GTSs not only dramatically regulated the relative abundance of the dominant flora in the HLS group but also had a unique regulatory flora. Figure 5F shows a strong negative correlation between butyric acid and gut microbiota, and the correlation coefficients of Prevotella and Jeotgalicoccus were more significant. Figure 5.

    "discussion": "Discussion Long-term microgravity exposure causes adverse effects on the immune system. The innate immune system, which is composed of granulocytes, natural killer cells, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, is the first line of defense for the body to initiate self-protection.22 It can not only recognize invading pathogens, but also sense and interact with the environment.23 Previous reports have suggested that more than 50% of astronauts on the first manned missions showed increased susceptibility to microbial infections caused by impaired innate immune systems.24 In addition, recent studies have further demonstrated that microgravity can impair the differentiation, function and signal transduction of innate immune cells.23 For example, the analysis of peripheral blood from astronauts showed that space flight would lead to impaired cell migration and antigen presentation mediated by monocytes in innate immunity.22 The intestinal innate immune system encompasses barrier defenses serviced by the epithelial cell layer, as well as bactericidal immune cell populations, including macrophages and neutrophils.25 Breakdowns in intestinal homeostasis driven by weightlessness are related to immune system perturbations.7 Intestinal immune cells are distributed in the intestinal epithelium, lamina propria, and lymphoid tissue.26 Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLD), which are located in lymphoid tissues, are sites of intestinal adaptive immune responses induced by intestinal microbiomes and mediate inflammatory responses.27 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are also important contributors. In this study, GTSs significantly increased the proportion of CD3+CD4+ T cells in MLD and improved the CD4+ /CD8+ ratio, suggesting that GTSs could enhance the cell-mediated immune response of MLD and the intestinal immune barrier. In addition, transcriptomic analysis identified innate immune pathways significantly associated with HLS and confirmed the downregulation of immune-related genes (Ly6e, Isg15 and Ifi27l2b) in the HLS group. To validate this outcome, we performed RT-PCR analysis and obtained similar results. Interestingly, GTSs effectively reversed the expression of these genes, suggesting its therapeutic potential. Ly6e exhibits transcriptional activity in numerous tissues, including the liver and intestine.28 Importantly, the biological functions of Ly6e have been linked to immunoregulatory functions, particularly T-cell proliferation and activation. Ly6e-loaded DCS effectively stimulated T Cell subsets and significantly increased the proportion of Th1 cells, which play an important role in colorectal cancer with immune cell infiltration.29 Interferon alpha inducible protein 27 (IFI27), including Ifi2712b, is responsible for a variety of biological processes including innate immunity and apoptosis.30,31 Liu et al investigated the protective effects of the poria cocos-derived polysaccharide, CMP33, against IBD and identified multiple regulatory genes including Ifi27l2b.32 Slfn4 belongs to the Schlafen (SLFNs) family, a family of proteins strongly induced by type 1 interferons (IFN-α) and has been implicated in myeloid cell differentiation, proliferation, and immune responses.33,34 Although much attention has been paid to the antiviral properties of Isg15, recent reports have also suggested that uncoupled Isg15 may act as a signalling molecule to stimulate immunomodulatory responses, such as neutrophil chemotaxis and activation of inflammatory cytokines.35 Our results showed that the expression of these genes significantly increased after GTSs treatment, suggesting that GTSs can protect intestinal immunity in a weightless environment. The intestinal microecology is co-defined with the intestinal barrier, intestinal microorganisms, and intestinal metabolites.36 Previous studies described the effects of weightlessness on these factors. Jin et al indicated that impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function caused by weightlessness is closely related to the intestinal villi and tight junction structures.7 In several tail-suspension rat models, researchers have observed typical pathologic features, such as intestinal villus shedding, decreased number of goblet cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration.7,37 At the same time, the expression levels of tight junction proteins were significantly decreased and inflammatory cytokines were increased. Similar changes were observed in the gene expression levels of tight junction proteins (claudin and occludin) and pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). HE staining confirmed the pathological injury of the small intestine in the HLS group, as well as the recovery potential of GTSs. Moreover, deficiency in mucin synthesis and secretion by goblet cells directly leads to intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction. GTSs effectively restored the reduction in goblet cells caused by weightlessness, which is another factor that supports the protective function of the intestinal barrier. At the gut microbes, a reduction in microbial diversity and beneficial species of Akkermansia and Lactobacillus was observed.4 Similar results were obtained in this study. For both endemic flora present only in the HLS group (Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus, g-prevotella, Corynebacterium, Jeotgalicoccus) and flora with variations in abundance (Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus), GTSs showed strong positive regulatory effects. Staphylococcus is an opportunistic pathogen that enhances intestinal permeability of intestine.38 Similarly, Prevotella colonization exacerbates intestinal inflammation and systemic autoimmune diseases.39 Lactobacillus has been identified as a versatile probiotic that participates in improving intestinal barrier function, immune regulation, metabolic regulation, and other biological processes.40 Clinically, Lactobacillus has been used to ameliorate intestinal disorders such as diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.41–43 Recent studies have shown that changes in the abundance of lactobacilli, ruminococcus, and Oscillospira directly affect intestinal permeability, systemic inflammation, and macrophage dysfunction.44,45 Notably, GTSs treatment reduced the abundance of these potentially pathogenic bacteria while increasing the content of beneficial bacteria, which is beneficial for maintaining gut microbial homeostasis and protecting host health. In addition, we found that GTSs independently regulated Lactobacillaceae and Bacilli, which have been shown to be beneficial for regulating intestinal immunity or inflammation.46,47 Taken together, these results indicate that GTSs can effectively restore the intestinal flora disorders induced by simulated microgravity. KEGG function prediction also confirmed that these bacteria are involved in immune processes. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, are mediators of communication between intestinal signals and immune functions, accounting for more than 90% of the total intestinal SCFAs.48 Acetic acid not only provides an important energy source for host cells but also protects intestinal epithelial cells by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins, thereby reducing intestinal permeability.49 Propionic acid can regulate intestinal inflammation, tight junction proteins, and mucin production to maintain the intestinal barrier function.50–52 Butyric acid has been shown to have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, which is closely related to intestinal permeability.53 In the present study, weightlessness caused a significant reduction in the levels of these SCFAs, which were antagonized by GTSs. A strong correlation was observed between butyric acid-Jeotgalicoccus and butyric acid-Prevotella. As a harmful bacterium,54 GTSs intervention reduced the abundance of Jeotgalicoccus in vivo, while the butyric acid content increased at the metabolic level, which confirmed the rationality of their negative correlation. Prevotella is directly related to butyric acid synthesis in vivo.55 Notably, our results showed inconsistent trends between Prevotella and butyric acid, which might be related to the regulatory effects of GTSS on other butyric acid-producing bacteria. These results further highlight the potential role of GTSs in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. Based on this result, we will conduct more detailed experiments to investigate the specific regulatory pathways of GTSs on intestinal immunity, gut microbiota and microbiota metabolites. It will help to investigate the effects of natural ingredients from food on the health and homeostasis of astronauts, and to play a better role in the operated spaceflight business.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion GTSs can improve intestinal microecological disorders and impair immune function caused by weightlessness. The underlying mechanism may be related to the “intestinal immune microbiota-metabolic” pathway. However, a more profound mechanism needs to be explored.",

Copyright notice ID: 11869762 PMID: 40026331 Abstract Background During medium- to long-duration spaceflights, real-time microgravity can increase the health risks of astronauts. In particular, the disruption of intestinal homeostasis is closely related to other health problems, and it is necessary to monitor related treatment strategies. Ginseng is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine often used to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), which are the bioactive components of ginseng, have been reported to regulate immune homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation. This study focused on the regulation of GTSs in intestinal homeostasis imbalance caused by microgravity.Methods A hindlimb suspension (HLS) rat model was established to evaluate the intestinal protective effects of GTSs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using RNA-Seq. RT-PCR was performed to further focus and verify these results. The gut microbiome composition was examined based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the short-chain fatty acids produced were further analyzed.Results We found that GTSs intervention effectively improved the intestinal injury caused by simulated weightlessness, including reducing the pathological damage, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing the levels of inflammatory factors. Moreover, GTSs treatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal immunity-related genes and remodeled the gut microbiota. In particular, GTSs significantly increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism-related bacteria, thereby increasing the level of propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid.Conclusion Our results revealed that GTSs improved intestinal microecological disorders and impaired immune function caused by the weightlessness simulation. The underlying mechanism may be related to the “intestinal immune -microbiota-metabolic” pathway. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the precise design and development of GTSs for space-health products.Keywords: ginseng total saponins, gastrointestinal microbiome, immunity, short-chain fatty acids, weightlessness simulationGraphical Abstract Open in a new tabIntroduction Long-duration spaceflight missions face challenges due to a variety of factors, including high vacuum, intense radiation, and low magnitude of gravity. Microgravity exposure is the main difficulty that needs to be overcome in real time, which causes astronauts to be in sub-health for a long time, affecting flight tasks and physical fitness.1 Several studies have shown that microgravity is closely related to health problems such as immune system disorders, cardiovascular dysfunction, and skeletal muscle loss. Intestinal microecology plays an important role in mediating the decline in these functions.2 Under weightlessness conditions, the intestine directly suffers from structural damage caused by various stress factors, including disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbiota imbalance.3,4 Moreover, the gut also regulates immune function and affects signal transduction between the host and intestinal microorganisms by producing intestinal microbial metabolites such as SCFAs.5,6 Evidence from animal experiments has reported serious intestinal barrier damage under weightlessness simulation, including typical intestinal villi injury, downregulation of tight junction protein expression, cell apoptosis, and increased intestinal permeability.3 Similarly, shortened intestinal villi, shallower crypt depth, and reduced mucin production in intestinal epithelial cells were observed in spaceflight rats.7,8 Recent data also show that the fluctuation of intestinal flora caused by weightlessness will lead to the imbalance of the immune system and increase the risk of opportunistic infection. A study revealed that weightlessness caused change in the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes, which may lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines by activating pattern recognition receptors8. In addition, microbiota metabolites also participate in the pathological changes of the digestive system related to spaceflight stress and play a role in the body signal transduction. Evidence shows that long-duration space flight significantly changes the gastrointestinal microbiota and related microbial metabolites of astronauts.9 The exploration based on animal experiments has also identified changes in intestinal metabolome such as amino acids and short-chain fatty acids, which are related to immune dysfunction and intestinal flora disorders.5,6 Thus, it is necessary to monitor intestinal microecological disorders caused by weightlessness and to discover related protective strategies to ensure the health of astronauts. In recent years, natural ingredients derived from plants or food, with the advantages of mild antibacterial activity, reparative action, and low resistance to human drugs, have shown broad application prospects in regulating the intestinal microecological balance.10 As a perennial plant with homology of medicine and food, ginseng has been used for thousands of years in many countries to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), a bioactive compound in ginseng, is responsible for most of the immunological and pharmacological activities of ginseng.11 According to previous records, GTSs have health benefits in regulating intestinal homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-central nervous system diseases, and in maintaining immunity.12 In particular, the effects of GTSs on intestinal immune regulation and inhibition of inflammation have been confirmed.13 GTSs are also beneficial for increasing the diversity of the gut microbiota, enhancing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides) and reducing the production of pathogenic bacteria (iron-removing bacteria, Helicobacter pylori) to enhance host health. In addition, the monomeric constituents of ginseng (including ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1, Rk3, and Re) can remodel the composition of the intestinal flora or modulate flora metabolites, thereby causing different effects on the intestinal barrier function, immune function, and host homeostasis.14–17 Because of its beneficial effects, CHM Taikong Yangxin prescription, which contains ginseng, has been used to keep Chinese astronauts healthy during their flights. In a previous study, we explored the potential of GTSs to maintain the neurological subhealth of astronauts.18 However, the regulatory effect of ginseng on intestinal homeostasis under weightlessness conditions remains unclear, and the underlying mechanisms related to gut-brain interactions remain to be explored. Therefore, we used the hindlimb suspension (HLS) model to evaluate the potential and possible mechanisms of GTSs in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, which will help to expand the health effects of ginseng and provide novel understanding and treatment options for health problems, starting with intestinal homeostasis during space travel.Materials and Methods Reagents and Chemicals The GTSs, prepared according to previously published methods,19 were provided by the Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Ginsenosides Rb1 (Cat no. RM0502), Rb2 (Cat no. RM0503), Rg1 (Cat no. RM0509), Rg2 (Cat no. RM0510), Rc (Cat no. RM0505), Rd (Cat no. RM0506), Re (Cat no. RM0507), and Rf (Cat no. RM0508) were obtained from RefMedic (Sichuan, China). TNF-α (Cat no. 1317202) and IL-6 (Cat no. 1310602) ELISA kits were bought from Dakewei Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). Anti-occludin (Cat no. 27260-1-AP) and anti-claudin-1 (Cat no. 28674-1-AP) antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Cat no. SA00001-2), GAPDH (Cat no. 10494-1-AP) were obtained from proteintech (Wuhan, China). Acetic acids (Cat no. A298827), propionic acids (Cat no. P110446), butyric acids (Cat no. B110440), and isobutyric acids (Cat no. B1103522) were obtained from Aladdin Scientific (Shanghai, China).Animals Specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats (200±20 g) were purchased from Beijing Charles River Experimental Animal Company [SCXK (Beijing, China) 2016–0006]. The animals were kept at a 12 h light/dark cycle environment with a humidity of 45–50% to acclimate for 5 days. All experiments were conducted according to the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care ( publication No.86–23, revised in 1996) and approved by the Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Animal Care and Use Committee [SYXK (Beijing, China) 2017–0020].HLS Model Rats were randomly divided into three groups (n=6): control (CON), hindlimb suspension (HLS), and the HLS treated with GTSs. The HLS model was established based on previous reports.20 Briefly, the hindlimbs were attached to a separate device with tape and chain hooks to form a 30-degree head-down tilt for 28 days. The CON and HLS groups were administered the same volume of water or GTSs (200 mg/kg, ig) daily. Subsequently, feces were collected for 16s rDNA sequencing on day 25, and serum and intestinal tissues were collected for other analyses on the last day.Qualitative Analysis of Components in GTSs Ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionization source and a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-ESI-QqQ-MS/MS), which contained an AB Sciex LC-MS system QTRAP® 6500, was used for separation and quantification. The samples were eluted using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH Shield RP18 column (2.1 mm×50 mm, 1.7 µm particles). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (acetonitrile) and ran under the following program: 0~5 min, 10%~23% B; 5~15 min, 23%~35% B; 15~20 min, 35~48% B; 20~20.5 min, 48%~90% B; 20.5~21.5 min, 90% B; 21.5~23 min, 90%~10% B; 23~25 min, 10% B. The flow rate was set at 0.3mL/min, and the injection volume was 5μL. The column temperature was maintained at 30 °C, and the samples were stored at 4 °C throughout the analysis. Electrospray ion source (ESI) and MRM were performed in the negative mode using nitrogen as the drying agent. The curtain gas (N2) was 40 psi, the collision gas (N2) was 9 psi, and the spray voltage was 5500 V. The atomization temperature was 550 °C, atomization gas (ion source gas 1, N2) and auxiliary gas (ion source gas 2, N2) were used. N2) were both at 55 psi. The corresponding ion pairs and cone voltages are listed in Table S1.Histological Examination Fresh small intestinal tissue from the same part was rinsed with normal saline and fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution until analysis. H&E and AB-PAS staining were performed to observe the tissue pathology, inflammatory responses, and goblet cell hyperplasia.Flow Cytometry Analysis Mesenteric lymph nodes were prepared as single-cell suspensions and subsequently incubated with anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD4-APC, anti-CD8-PE, and anti-CD45-APC antibodies (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The stained cells were analyzed using a CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA).Real-Time PCR Gene expression levels were measured by real-time PCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from small intestinal tissue and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The primers used are listed in Table S2. Data were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method with GAPDH as the internal reference for normalization.Transcriptome Analysis of Small Intestinal Tissue Small intestine sections were collected from the Con and HLS groups and transcriptome sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq sequencer by Beijing Boyun Huakang Gene Technology Co., Ltd. Raw data from transcriptomic experiments were deposited in the  SRA database (BioProject ID: PRJNA944741). The raw reads were filtered, and the clean reads were mapped to the rat reference genome (rn6) using HISAT software. Gene expression was quantified by fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped values (FPKM), and the PossionDis algorithm was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs; log2(fold change) ≥1 and q value ≤0.001). DEGs were then subjected to GO functional annotation. RT-PCR analysis was performed to further screen the DEGs regulated by the GTSs. Primer sequences used are listed in Table S2.Gut Microbiota Structural Profiling Total DNA was isolated from rat fecal pellets by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Briefly, 1% agarose gel was used to monitor DNA concentration and purity. According to the concentration, DNA was diluted to 1 ng/μL by adding sterile water. MiSeq systems based on 16S rRNA genes were used to analyze the gut microbiota. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify specific V3-V4 variable regions using barcode and high-frequency primers. A agarose gel electrophoresis (2%) and AxyPrepDNA (Axygen Scientific Inc. USA) gel recovery kit was used to detect PCR products and recover PCR fragments. According to the preliminary electrophoresis results, QuantiFluor™-ST blue fluorescence quantitative system (Promega Company) was utilized to detect and quantify the products of PCR amplification. The samples were mixed in equal proportions and subjected to the Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, USA) to construct the libraries. The library was sequenced on a computer following a quality check performed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and a qubit. Raw data from 16S rRNA experiments were deposited in the  SRA database (BioProject ID: PRJNA941119). The library was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Paired-end reads from the original DNA fragments were merged using FLASH software. The sequences were analyzed using UPARSE Version 7.0, with the UPARSE-OTU and UPARSE-out ref algorithms. In-house Perl scripts were used to analyze the diversity values of alpha (within samples) and beta (among samples). An in-house Perl program was used to assign sequences to the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs).SCFAs Analysis Quantitative analyses were performed as previously described by our group. The fecal sample (~10 mg) was thawed on ice and 200 µL of 50% methanol was added to prepare the homogenate. After centrifugation (4°C13,000 rpm, 10 min), 8 µL of the supernatant was collected. 50% methanol (72 µL), 1M EDC (10 µL), 1M O-BHA (10 µL), and 500 nM Acetic Acid-1-13C (5 µL; IS) were mixed with the supernatant. Derivatization was performed at 25 °C for 1h. Subsequently, 600 µL dichloromethane was added for extraction and 400 µL of the lower organic phase was collected and dried at 37 °C. Finally, 200 µL of 50% methanol was added to the sample, re-dissolved, and centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was used to re-dissolve the sample. The supernatant was used for LC-MS analysis (AB Sciex LC-MS System QTRAP® 6500). Chromatographic separation was achieved using an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1mm×100mm, 1.8 µm) at 50°C with a typical flow rate (200 nL/min). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and isopropanol (solvent B). The linear gradient was set as follows: 85%–85% A (0.0 to 1.0 min), 85%–64% A (1.0 to 8.0 min), 64%–50% A (8.0 to 8.5 min), 50%–50% A (8.5 to 10.5 min), and 50%–85% A (10.5 to 15 min). Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed in the positive ion mode with an electrospray ion source (ESI) and MRM mode using nitrogen as the drying agent. The curtain gas (N2) was 35 psi, collision gas (N2) was 9 psi, and the spray voltage was 4500 V. The measured parameters for specific ion pairs are listed in Table S3.Statistical Analysis All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed GraphPad Prism 8 (La Jolla, CA, USA). Significant differences of multiple groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett post-hoc test or Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results The Content of Eight Ginsenosides in GTSs Was Detected by UPLC-MS The MRM chromatograms of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rg1, Rg2, Rc, Rd, Re, and Rf from GTSs were optimized for quantitative analysis. The calibration curve of the eight compounds showed good linearity with the available standards (R2 > 0.99), and the lower limits of quantification for the ginsenosides ranged from 2.4414 to 312.5 ng/mL, indicating sufficient sensitivity for quantitative evaluation. As a result, It contained 258.89 mg/g Rb1, 65.77 mg/g Rb2, 12.87 mg/gRg1, 26.14 mg/g Rg2, 93.72 mg/g Rc, 90.90 mg/g Rd, 105.34 mg/g Re and 20.87 mg/g Rf (Figure S1).Effect of GTSs on Intestinal Injury of Simulated Weightlessness Rats As shown in Figure 1A, pathological analysis was performed to observe tissue damage. Compared to the CON group, obvious pathological damage occurred in the small intestine tissue of the HLS group, including typical small bowel villous atrophy, crypt inflammation, crypt dropout and crypt atrophy. However, GTSs effectively improved the villi/crypt ratio (Figure 1B) and alleviated the impaired intestinal symptoms.Mucin secreted by goblet cells is the first line of innate host defence. To confirm intestinal injury, we performed AB/PAS staining to evaluate the number of goblet cells (Figure 1A). In this study, significant goblet cell depletion and mucin reduction were observed in HLS group, which were reversed to varying degrees after GTSs treatment (Figure 1C and D). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Ginsenosides can improve the histopathological changes of HLS rats. (A) Small intestine tissue for HE and AB-PSA staining (Top amplification: x5, Scale bar: 500 μm; Bottom amplification: x20, Scale bar: 100 μm). In HE staining, typical crypt inflammation (black arrow), crypt dropout (yellow arrow) and crypt atrophy (red arrow). In AB-PSA staining, goblet cells, responsible for secreting acidic mucin, are stained blue. (B) Villus/crypt ratio of HE staining.(C) Numbers of goblet cells of AB-PAS staining. (D) AB-PAS staining area of acidic mucin. In each analysis, 6 random fields were selected for statistics. Quantitative data were expressed as the mean ± SEM from 6 rats in each group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, compared with CON group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, compared with HLS group.Similarly, occludin and claudin, which are typical markers of tight junctions, were regulated by GTSs, were significantly increased after GTSs treatment (Figure 2A and B). The proportion of CD3+CD4+ T cells was significantly lower in the HLS group than that in the CON group, whereas the proportion of CD3+CD8+ T cells tended to increase (Figure 2C). GTSs regulated these changes close to normal levels, indicating that GTSs effectively restored the intestinal immune imbalance. Figure 2.

A combined plot was used to display the results. They have the same vertical axis corresponding to different cytokines. While the horizontal axis represents experimental groups in the heatmap and the relative mRNA levels in the stacked bar chart. (E) The expressional levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in small intestine were determined by ELISA.Data are presented as the mean ± SEM, n=5–6. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, compared with CON group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001, compared with HLS group.Cytokines are capable of mediating intestinal immunity and epithelial crosstalk. RT-PCR was performed to determine the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-7. The contents of TNF-α and IL-6 in small intestine were analyzed by ELISA kit. As shown in Figure 2D–E, GTSs treatment reduced the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in the HLS group. In conclusion, GTSs had a positive protective effect in rats with simulated weightlessness.Effects of Simulated Weightlessness and GTSs on Gut Function The small intestines of six rats were performed transcriptome in CON and HLS groups. Compared with the CON group, 660 genes were upregulated and 70 genes were downregulated in the HLS group. GO function enrichment analysis was performed to understand the biological processes of DEGs (Figure 3A). The results revealed that the downregulated genes were primarily associated with innate immune response. Upregulated genes are often found during the ion transmembrane transport. The top 40 differentially expressed genes were identified. The results showed that The levels of genes related to innate immunity (including Slfn4, Ly6e, Ifi2712, etc.) were significantly lower in the HLS group than in the CON group (Figure 3B). We performed RT-PCR analysis to validate the sequencing results and evaluate the therapeutic effects of GTSs. As shown in Figure 3C, HLS significantly decreased the expression of Isg15, Slfn4, Ly6e and Ifi27l2b, whereas the reduction in HLS rats were gradually reverted to normal levels after GTSs treatment.

The quality control data with reliable base calling are listed in Table S4. The rarefaction curve indicated that the amount of sequencing data obtained in this study was reasonable (Figure S2). Alpha diversity, based on Shannon’s analysis, was used to characterize the species diversity of the microbial communities. Strikingly, a sequential decrease in microbiota composition was observed in the HLS and GTSs groups (Figure 4A). However, there were differences in the relative abundance of dominant flora among the experimental groups, especially at the phylum and genus levels. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes dominated the fecal samples of all groups, and GTSs may have restored the relative abundance of these two species in rats subjected to weightlessness. Similarly, GTSs had modulatory effects on the dominant genera in the three groups, including Lactobacillus, Tumorcoccus, Oscillospira and All0baculum (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the Anosim test showed significant intergroup differences in bacterial community structure, and NMDS analysis was used to assess this change (Figure 4C). To further identify the most significant differential microbiota between the experimental groups, corresponding LEfSe analysis was performed (Figure 4D). The results showed that Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Jeotgalicoccus were the dominant bacteria in the model group, and their relative abundance was significantly reduced after GTSs intervention (Table S5). In addition, compared with the CON group, Lactobacillus, Lactobacillaceae and Bacilli were identified as the major contributing flora in the GTSs group. These results suggest that GTSs have a dual modulatory effect on the gut microbial composition and abundance in simulated weightless rats. KEGG function prediction revealed that GTSs may be involved in signaling molecules and interactions, energy metabolism, immune function, and the nervous system by affecting the intestinal flora (Figure 4E).

Six samples from each group were analyzed.GTSs Improves Short-Chain Fatty Acid Content in Simulated Weightless Rats Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and microbial metabolites have been proven to have beneficial effects on the intestinal barrier and inflammation.21 A reliable UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was established to measure the contents of four major SCFAs (acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid), which cumulatively accounted for 95% of the total SCFAs. The related figure and supporting data are presented in Figure S3 and Table S6, respectively. In addition to acetic acid, the contents of the other three SCFAs were significantly reduced in the HLS group, and GTS demonstrated the potential to restore SCFAs towards normal levels (Figure 5A–E). Correlation analysis was used to determine the contribution of the gut microbiota and SCFAS to the treatment of GTSs. In previous analyses, we found that GTSs not only dramatically regulated the relative abundance of the dominant flora in the HLS group but also had a unique regulatory flora. Figure 5F shows a strong negative correlation between butyric acid and gut microbiota, and the correlation coefficients of Prevotella and Jeotgalicoccus were more significant. Figure 5.

The innate immune system, which is composed of granulocytes, natural killer cells, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, is the first line of defense for the body to initiate self-protection.22 It can not only recognize invading pathogens, but also sense and interact with the environment.23 Previous reports have suggested that more than 50% of astronauts on the first manned missions showed increased susceptibility to microbial infections caused by impaired innate immune systems.24 In addition, recent studies have further demonstrated that microgravity can impair the differentiation, function and signal transduction of innate immune cells.23 For example, the analysis of peripheral blood from astronauts showed that space flight would lead to impaired cell migration and antigen presentation mediated by monocytes in innate immunity.22 The intestinal innate immune system encompasses barrier defenses serviced by the epithelial cell layer, as well as bactericidal immune cell populations, including macrophages and neutrophils.25 Breakdowns in intestinal homeostasis driven by weightlessness are related to immune system perturbations.7 Intestinal immune cells are distributed in the intestinal epithelium, lamina propria, and lymphoid tissue.26 Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLD), which are located in lymphoid tissues, are sites of intestinal adaptive immune responses induced by intestinal microbiomes and mediate inflammatory responses.27 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are also important contributors. In this study, GTSs significantly increased the proportion of CD3+CD4+ T cells in MLD and improved the CD4+ /CD8+ ratio, suggesting that GTSs could enhance the cell-mediated immune response of MLD and the intestinal immune barrier. In addition, transcriptomic analysis identified innate immune pathways significantly associated with HLS and confirmed the downregulation of immune-related genes (Ly6e, Isg15 and Ifi27l2b) in the HLS group. To validate this outcome, we performed RT-PCR analysis and obtained similar results. Interestingly, GTSs effectively reversed the expression of these genes, suggesting its therapeutic potential. Ly6e exhibits transcriptional activity in numerous tissues, including the liver and intestine.28 Importantly, the biological functions of Ly6e have been linked to immunoregulatory functions, particularly T-cell proliferation and activation. Ly6e-loaded DCS effectively stimulated T Cell subsets and significantly increased the proportion of Th1 cells, which play an important role in colorectal cancer with immune cell infiltration.29 Interferon alpha inducible protein 27 (IFI27), including Ifi2712b, is responsible for a variety of biological processes including innate immunity and apoptosis.30,31 Liu et al investigated the protective effects of the poria cocos-derived polysaccharide, CMP33, against IBD and identified multiple regulatory genes including Ifi27l2b.32 Slfn4 belongs to the Schlafen (SLFNs) family, a family of proteins strongly induced by type 1 interferons (IFN-α) and has been implicated in myeloid cell differentiation, proliferation, and immune responses.33,34 Although much attention has been paid to the antiviral properties of Isg15, recent reports have also suggested that uncoupled Isg15 may act as a signalling molecule to stimulate immunomodulatory responses, such as neutrophil chemotaxis and activation of inflammatory cytokines.35 Our results showed that the expression of these genes significantly increased after GTSs treatment, suggesting that GTSs can protect intestinal immunity in a weightless environment. The intestinal microecology is co-defined with the intestinal barrier, intestinal microorganisms, and intestinal metabolites.36 Previous studies described the effects of weightlessness on these factors. Jin et al indicated that impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function caused by weightlessness is closely related to the intestinal villi and tight junction structures.7 In several tail-suspension rat models, researchers have observed typical pathologic features, such as intestinal villus shedding, decreased number of goblet cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration.7,37 At the same time, the expression levels of tight junction proteins were significantly decreased and inflammatory cytokines were increased. Similar changes were observed in the gene expression levels of tight junction proteins (claudin and occludin) and pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). HE staining confirmed the pathological injury of the small intestine in the HLS group, as well as the recovery potential of GTSs. Moreover, deficiency in mucin synthesis and secretion by goblet cells directly leads to intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction. GTSs effectively restored the reduction in goblet cells caused by weightlessness, which is another factor that supports the protective function of the intestinal barrier. At the gut microbes, a reduction in microbial diversity and beneficial species of Akkermansia and Lactobacillus was observed.4 Similar results were obtained in this study. For both endemic flora present only in the HLS group (Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus, g-prevotella, Corynebacterium, Jeotgalicoccus) and flora with variations in abundance (Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus), GTSs showed strong positive regulatory effects. Staphylococcus is an opportunistic pathogen that enhances intestinal permeability of intestine.38 Similarly, Prevotella colonization exacerbates intestinal inflammation and systemic autoimmune diseases.39 Lactobacillus has been identified as a versatile probiotic that participates in improving intestinal barrier function, immune regulation, metabolic regulation, and other biological processes.40 Clinically, Lactobacillus has been used to ameliorate intestinal disorders such as diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.41–43 Recent studies have shown that changes in the abundance of lactobacilli, ruminococcus, and Oscillospira directly affect intestinal permeability, systemic inflammation, and macrophage dysfunction.44,45 Notably, GTSs treatment reduced the abundance of these potentially pathogenic bacteria while increasing the content of beneficial bacteria, which is beneficial for maintaining gut microbial homeostasis and protecting host health. In addition, we found that GTSs independently regulated Lactobacillaceae and Bacilli, which have been shown to be beneficial for regulating intestinal immunity or inflammation.46,47 Taken together, these results indicate that GTSs can effectively restore the intestinal flora disorders induced by simulated microgravity. KEGG function prediction also confirmed that these bacteria are involved in immune processes. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, are mediators of communication between intestinal signals and immune functions, accounting for more than 90% of the total intestinal SCFAs.48 Acetic acid not only provides an important energy source for host cells but also protects intestinal epithelial cells by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins, thereby reducing intestinal permeability.49 Propionic acid can regulate intestinal inflammation, tight junction proteins, and mucin production to maintain the intestinal barrier function.50–52 Butyric acid has been shown to have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, which is closely related to intestinal permeability.53 In the present study, weightlessness caused a significant reduction in the levels of these SCFAs, which were antagonized by GTSs. A strong correlation was observed between butyric acid-Jeotgalicoccus and butyric acid-Prevotella. As a harmful bacterium,54 GTSs intervention reduced the abundance of Jeotgalicoccus in vivo, while the butyric acid content increased at the metabolic level, which confirmed the rationality of their negative correlation. Prevotella is directly related to butyric acid synthesis in vivo.55 Notably, our results showed inconsistent trends between Prevotella and butyric acid, which might be related to the regulatory effects of GTSS on other butyric acid-producing bacteria. These results further highlight the potential role of GTSs in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. Based on this result, we will conduct more detailed experiments to investigate the specific regulatory pathways of GTSs on intestinal immunity, gut microbiota and microbiota metabolites. It will help to investigate the effects of natural ingredients from food on the health and homeostasis of astronauts, and to play a better role in the operated spaceflight business.Conclusion GTSs can improve intestinal microecological disorders and impair immune function caused by weightlessness. The underlying mechanism may be related to the “intestinal immune microbiota-metabolic” pathway. However, a more profound mechanism needs to be explored.Funding Statement This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.82074103), the Space Engineering Space Medical Experiment Field Program of China (HYZHXM05003), Major Science and Technology Project in the Autonomous Region (grant number: 2023A02010-3), and the Scientific and Technological Innovation Project of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (CI2021A04905 and CI2021B015).Abbreviations GTSs, Ginseng total saponins; HLS, hind limb suspension; MLD, Mesenteric lymph nodes; SCFAs, Short-chain fatty acids.Data Sharing Statement Data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.Author Contributions All authors made a significant contribution to the work reported, whether in the conception, study design, execution, acquisition of data, analysis, and interpretation, or in all these areas, took part in drafting, revising, or critically reviewing the article; gave final approval of the version to be published; have agreed on the journal to which the article has been submitted; and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work.

    "abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µg) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Numerous plant spaceflight studies have long focused on unraveling the complex physiological changes plants undergo in the spaceflight environment. In their diversity, these studies have accumulated an extensive array of phenotypic characterizations and uncovered some of the fundamental concepts related to physiological adaptation in space (Kordyum and Hasenstein, 2021). However, the traditional approaches have recently been complemented and in many ways superseded by the advent of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic methods, setting the stage for high throughput analyses that investigates the effects of spaceflight on plants from a molecular and functional perspective (Hughes and Kiss, 2022). This allows the physiological effects of the spaceflight environment to be characterized beyond phenotyping and extensively mapped out along broader biochemical pathways and cryptic signaling molecular cascades. While some remarkable advancements in genomic and transcriptomics studies of plants in spaceflight have been widely recorded (Ferl et al., 2002; Paul et al., 2012; Barker et al., 2023), such studies have largely been conducted in isolation, independent of proteomics. Unlike genomic and transcriptomic studies, proteomics studies face certain limitations in the spaceflight context, predominantly due to the limited availability of plant tissues for analysis. As a result, comprehensive spaceflight proteomics studies conducted on the whole Arabidopsis plant have been relatively few, with only three reported so far (Mazars et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015; Barker et al., 2020; Kruse et al., 2020). Mazars et al. (2014) conducted the first true proteomics-scale study of Arabidopsis microsome-associated membrane proteins on the ISS followed by Hausmann et al. (2014) study on the proteome of Arabidopsis cell cultures in parabolic flights and Zhang et al. (2015) proteomic study on Arabidopsis callus aboard the Chinese SZ-8 spacecraft in spaceflight. Ferl et al. (2015) comparison of the transcriptome and protein abundances between the leaf and root of Arabidopsis in spaceflight represented the first use of a combined transcriptomics-proteomics investigative approach for whole plant spaceflight experiment, followed by a similar but more in-depth approach by Kruse et al. (2020) where they revealed novel regulatory responses of Arabidopsis seedlings in spaceflight. Reports from these two multi-omics studies indicated that the true power of omics approaches becomes apparent when they are combined, providing a comprehensive view of how gene expression and protein synthesis respond to the unique conditions of spaceflight. Likewise, the reported low correlation between transcripts and proteome of Arabidopsis grown in spaceflight and spaceflight hardware (Basu et al., 2017; Kruse et al., 2017; Kruse et al., 2020) reinforced the benefits of a multi-omics approach. Studying plants’ adaptation to the spaceflight environment usually involves plants being flown to the ISS in designated hardware, whose designs and subsequent improvements are often based on the objectives of the experiment at hand (Kanapskyte et al., 2021; Nicholson et al., 2021). One such hardware is the Biological Research In Canister – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED). BRIC LED hardware is designed to enhance the capabilities of existing BRIC Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFU) by the incorporation of a customizable discreet lighting system. Hence, biological organisms growing in the BRIC LED hardware are illuminated by LEDs with options of four different wavelengths (blue, red, far-red, and white) (Howard and Caron, 2016). Spaceflight experiments in the BRIC LED hardware expose plants to light cues in microgravity, hence closely simulating a natural environment where plants have to simultaneously integrate light and gravitational signaling. The incorporation of weightlessness and light signaling is expected to elicit several physiological and molecular responses which are distinct from other hardware without a light source (Stankovic, 2018), with the responses often novel and a function of cross-talks among various signaling pathways rather than an individual signal transduction pathway. Tightly regulated by complex cross-signaling pathways, the responses are usually specific to each plant organ and most times, tissues (Wolinska and Berens, 2019). Transcripts and proteomes encoding these stress response pathways are usually localized to a particular intracellular or extracellular region, further reinforcing the idea that studies on plant stress response should be focused on finer resolutions of organs, tissues, cells, and organelles. Several studies have identified that the plant root and shoot respond in an organ-specific manner to gravity (Paul et al., 2013; Vandenbrink et al., 2014; Lamers et al., 2020) and other environmental stresses (Paponov et al., 2021). Hence, resolving plant proteomic responses to the spaceflight environment on an organ-specific level is a step further in understanding stress response signaling pathways and the molecular adaptations of each plant organ to the spaceflight environment and how such adaptation mechanisms can be manipulated for improved plant production in space and on earth. Therefore, building upon these previous achievements in plant multi-omics research in spaceflight, we took a significant step forward by integrating both proteomics and transcriptomics approaches to understand the response of Arabidopsis plants to the spaceflight environment. Through increased coverage and finer spatial proteomic resolution, we assessed the effects of the earth’s low orbit spaceflight environment aboard the ISS on the shoot and root of the Arabidopsis seedlings. The seedlings were grown in the NASA BRIC LED hardware, hence we provided robust insight into the plant transcriptome landscape and organ-specific proteomic responses of Arabidopsis to the spaceflight environment, while at the same time conducting a hardware verification test for the novel BRIC LED hardware.",

Transcriptomics and proteomics recovery in the BRIC LED experiment The differential analysis of the transcriptome expressed between spaceflight and ground control Arabidopsis samples yielded 15,505 distinctly mapped RNA transcripts, with 2,474 being statistically significant at adjusted p<0.05. Of this, 195 RNA are upregulated in spaceflight at L2FCRNA≥1, while 761 are downregulated in spaceflight at L2FCRNA≤−1 ( Figure 1A ). Protein extraction from the different organs (root and shoot) and across the cellular fractions (soluble and membrane) led to the quantification, in the root, of 20,923 peptides mapped to 3973 membrane proteins and 18,636 peptides mapped to 3412 soluble proteins. Similar to this, in the shoot, 20,658 peptides were mapped to 3965 membrane proteins and 20,091 peptides were mapped to 3537 soluble proteins. Only proteins with a FDR of 0.01 and a minimum of two uniquely mapped non-nested peptides (amino acid length >6 were retained. Proteins with B–H adjusted p≤0.05 were identified as statistically significant in the dataset. A total of 2187 membrane proteins and 332 soluble proteins were statistically significant in the root, while 1856 membrane proteins and 476 soluble proteins were statistically significant in the shoot. At the decision thresholds of L2FCprotein≥0.2 and L2FCprotein≤−0.2, 821 membrane proteins and 135 soluble proteins in the root were more abundant in spaceflight, whereas 1199 membrane proteins and 162 soluble proteins were less abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 1A ). Likewise, in the shoot, 1031 and 270 membrane and soluble proteins respectively were less abundant in spaceflight compared to ground control, while 778 membrane proteins and 172 soluble proteins were more abundant in spaceflight compared to ground control ( Figure 1A ). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Transcriptome and proteome recovery in BRIC LED experiment. (A). Bar plots of the RNA and protein abundance distribution in spaceflight and in ground control. On the protein plots, solid-colored bars represent the membrane proteins while hashed bars represent the soluble protein. The quantity of differentially abundant RNA and proteins (p<0.05) is indicated in parentheses. RNA and proteins with L2FCRNA≥1 and L2FCprotein≥0.2 respectively were considered abundant in spaceflight while those with L2FCRNA≤−1 and L2FCprotein≤−0.2 respectively were considered less abundant in space. (B). Volcano plot of the total abundance and distribution of RNA and proteins between spaceflight and ground tissues. The negative log of the adjusted p-values was plotted on the y-axis against the normalized log2 fold change on the x-axis. Dots represent RNA and protein abundance with black dots representing non-significantly expressed proteins (p>0.05 and those with L2FC not within the threshold), red dots represent less abundant RNA and proteins in spaceflight while blue dots represent proteins that were more abundant in spaceflight than on earth. (C). Venn diagram of differential protein abundance in spaceflight. Combination of differential proteins more abundant in spaceflight and less abundant in spaceflight, as distinct to each organ and as shared by both organs. Shoot UP indicates shoot proteins more abundant in spaceflight, shoot DOWN indicates shoot proteins less abundant in spaceflight, Root UP indicates root proteins more abundant in spaceflight while root DOWN indicates root proteins less abundant in spaceflight.The volcano plot ( Figure 1B ) of the total mapped RNA and protein across the organs and cell fractions gives a broader view of the pattern of abundance of transcriptome and proteome in spaceflight. Applying the widely accepted threshold for RNA tier II analysis, L2FCRNA≥1 or L2FCRNA≤−1, reduces false positives in interpreting the biological significance of the differentially expressed transcripts (McDermaid et al., 2019). However, this also led to the exclusion of over 61% of our total statistically significant transcripts ( Figure 1B ), with the possibility of the exclusion of some transcripts with biological significance. Membrane proteins were more differentially abundant (p<0.05) and highly perturbed in spaceflight compared to the soluble proteins. Membrane proteins in the root had the largest abundance and fold enrichment, followed by the membrane and soluble proteins in the shoots respectively, while soluble proteins in the root were the least quantified and least differentially abundant ( Figure 1B ). Several studies (Sarasketa et al., 2016; Paponov et al., 2021) have identified specificity in the proteomic profile of root and shoot in response to various environmental perturbations such as magnetic field, hormonal homeostasis, and gravity. This study further provides insight into how the specific plant organs (root and shoot) respond to microgravity in spaceflight. The organ-targeted proteomic profiling in response to microgravity, in this study, revealed that roots and shoots adapt differently to the spaceflight environment, and at the same time, they share certain commonalities. Comparing root-specific protein abundance in spaceflight to Earth, 400 membrane proteins and 75 soluble proteins were more abundant in space, whereas 606 membrane proteins and 71 soluble proteins were less abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 1C ). For proteins specific to the shoot, 357 membrane, and 112 soluble proteins were more abundant in spaceflight, whereas 438 membrane and 179 soluble proteins were less abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 1C ). Common to both root and shoot, 421 membrane proteins and 60 soluble proteins were more abundant in spaceflight compared to on Earth. Likewise, the abundance of 593 membrane proteins and 91 soluble proteins was reduced in spaceflight across both organs. Interestingly, a comparison of the differentially abundant proteins shared by both organs revealed that 18 membrane proteins were more abundant in spaceflight in the root and less abundant in the shoot, while 34 membrane proteins were more abundant in spaceflight in the shoot and less abundant in the root ( Figure 1C , Table 1 ). A GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of the 34 membrane proteins with increased abundance in the shoot and decreased abundance in the root in spaceflight revealed that they were majorly involved in the photosynthetic pathway, carbon metabolism pathway, and amide biosynthetic process. Likewise, these proteins were majorly chloroplast localized and are enriched for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) phosphorylating activity, poly(U) RNA binding, and oxidoreductase activity ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). KEGG pathway analysis of the 18 membrane proteins that were more abundant in spaceflight in the root and less abundant in the shoot did not indicate their involvements in a major metabolic pathway. However, some of these proteins were the heat shock proteins (HSP70, HSP90.4), host defense proteins such as the Importin (IMPA-4) and Pectinesterase inhibitor 17 (PME17), proteins involved in shunt energy processes such as the Transketolase (TLK2) and Electron Transfer flavoprotein (ETFQ).

Subcellular distribution and abundance of protein in spaceflight Several metabolic processes in cells, such as signal transduction, transport of molecules, cell division, cell death, etc., are tightly linked with the location of specific transcripts and proteins (Christopher et al., 2022). Transcripts are targeted toward different subcellular organelles in the plant cell based on the specific functions of encoded proteins. Assessing which of the targeted organelles have the highest amount of perturbed proteins gives insight into the metabolic process most affected by the spaceflight environment. Our expectation is that since transcripts encode proteins that are targeted toward different organelles, the pattern of subcellular localization of the RNA transcripts differentially expressed should be similar to that of proteins differentially expressed in spaceflight. To ascertain this, we compared transcripts and proteins with differential abundance in our spaceflight experiments against SUBA4, and results were subsequently fed into SUBAcon (Hooper et al., 2017) to recover more accurate proteome-wide subcellular localizations. Transcripts encoding nucleus-targeted proteins constituted the largest percentage of the transcripts upregulated (25%) and downregulated (28.5%) in spaceflight ( Figure 2A ). KEGG pathway analysis of the nucleus-targeted transcripts upregulated in spaceflight indicated that they are majorly involved in plant hormone signal transduction pathways which are tryptophan metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis, diterpenoid biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism ( Supplementary Figure 2A ). Transcripts encoding nucleus-targeted proteins downregulated in spaceflight are involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome pathway, with many being part of the ubiquitin ligase complex and the ER-associated degradation complex (ERAD) ( Supplementary Figure 2B ). Another interesting group of transcripts are those encoding proteins targeted towards extracellular matrix, being 20% of the total upregulated RNA and 11.1% of the total downregulated RNA. Upregulated transcripts encoding extracellular-matrix targeted proteins are enriched in cell wall biogenesis, cell wall macromolecule metabolic process, and flavonoid metabolic process, while the downregulated ones are uniquely enriched in pathways involved in response to salicylic acid, polysaccharide biosynthetic process, response to brassinosteroid and cell wall organization ( Figure 2B ). The metabolic pathways enriched were significantly different in the extracellular protein dataset in comparison with the RNA transcriptome ( Figure 2B ). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Subcellular localization of differentially abundant RNA and proteins in spaceflight. (A). Bar chart comparing the percentage of RNA transcripts (hashed bars) and root (dotted bars) and shoot (black bars) proteins localized in each subcellular compartment. The subcellular localizations were identified using SUBA4 and localization consensus was determined using SUBAcon. (B). GO enrichment heat map and hierarchical cluster tree of transcripts that encode extracellular matrix-targeted proteins and the proteins that are localized in the extracellular matrix. The color gradient of the heatmap indicates the significance of the genes and proteins in the enriched metabolic pathways. Labels with “Up” means upregulated in spaceflight and downregulated on Earth while labels with “Down” indicates downregulated in spaceflight and upregulated on Earth.In the root, plastid localized proteins constituted 35.5% of soluble and membrane proteins with reduced abundance in spaceflight, while they constituted 10.3% of proteins more abundant in spaceflight than on earth ( Figure 2A ). Enrichment analysis of root plastid localized proteins that were differentially abundant in spaceflight indicated that proteins involved in plastid movements, organization of plastid membranes, and light harvesting were less abundant in spaceflight than on earth, while those involved in valine biosynthetic pathways, reductive pentose-phosphate cycle, and the dark reaction of photosynthesis were more abundant in spaceflight. The valine biosynthetic pathway is intertwined with the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway, and they both inhibit the growth of shoots (Cao et al., 2019) and increase root formation. Notably, 154 membrane and 51 soluble extracellular localized proteins were abundant in spaceflight in the root and they are majorly involved in glycan degradation, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and pentose-glucuronate interconversion. This is indicative of increased restructuring of the root cell wall polysaccharides in spaceflight. The distribution of protein localization in the shoot is similar to the root, with plastid localized proteins constituting 32.4% of proteins less abundant in spaceflight, while cytosolic protein constituted 33.4% of the proteins more abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 2A ). However, enrichment analysis of shoot plastid localized proteins indicated high enrichment of proteins involved in plastid transcription and organization, chlorophyll metabolism, and photosynthesis. Contrary to the root, 83 membrane and 63 soluble extracellular proteins were more abundant in spaceflight and they are highly enriched in pathways for cellular oxidation regulation and negative regulation of peptidase activities. Extracellular proteins less abundant in spaceflight are enriched in pathways responsible for plant defense. An interesting observation as regards the comparative subcellular localization of transcriptome and root and shoot proteome in spaceflight is that most downregulated RNA in spaceflight encode proteins targeted back to the nucleus whereas most downregulated proteins in spaceflight are plastids localized. Cytosolic proteins are most upregulated in spaceflight, whereas transcripts encoding nucleus-targeted proteins are most upregulated ( Figure 2A ). 3.3. Enrichment analysis of the gene ontology terms Creating a functional profile of transcriptome and proteome abundance in spaceflight elucidates various underlying biological, cellular and molecular processes affected by the harsh spaceflight environmental conditions such as microgravity, ionizing radiation and so on. Insight into the biological roles of these RNAs and proteins was acquired through enrichment analysis of the protein ontologies. A common feature in spaceflight, across the transcriptome and proteome landscapes, is the upregulation and enrichment of stress response proteins, especially those involved in response to light stimulus, radiation, oxygen, and water deprivation ( Figure 3A ). Enriched among the downregulated RNA and proteins are those involved in translation, amide biosynthetic process, mitochondrial and peroxisome fission ( Figure 3A ). A correlation plot of the expression (log2 fold change) of transcripts and the shoot and root proteins indicated very low gene expression correlation between shoot proteins and transcripts (r=−0.004) and between root proteins and transcripts (r=0.021). However, protein expression between the shoot and root is positively correlated (r=0.878) ( Figure 3B ). An overview of the gene ontology of the gene expression pattern between the transcripts and shoot and root proteins is represented by a heat map ( Figure 3C ). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Gene ontology enrichment of RNA and proteins differentially expressed in spaceflight (A). Network interaction map of RNA and proteins with a similar pattern of expression in spaceflight. Upregulated transcripts with upregulated proteins are above, while downregulated transcripts with downregulated proteins are below. The node sizes indicate the number of genes enriched in that pathway while two pathways (nodes) are connected only if they share a minimum of 20% genes. GO terms enrichment analyses were conducted in ShinyGO 0.77 (GO terms were accessed in June 2023). (B). Correlation graph of the log2 fold change of shoot and root proteins with total RNA transcripts. The correlations were plotted separately with black triangles representing the correlation of the log2 fold change of proteins in the root and the log2 fold change of the plant total RNA (root vs total RNA) with a correlation coefficient, r2=0.021, and circles representing the correlation of the log2 fold change of proteins in the shoot and the log2 fold change of the plant total RNA (shoot vs total RNA) with a correlation coefficient, r2 =−0.004. The plot of the correlation of the log2 fold change of shared proteins in the root and shoot (Root vs Shoot) is not shown on the graph. However, its correlation coefficient (r2=0.878) is displayed. (C). Heatmap of the GO enrichment of gene expression patterns in RNA, shoot, and root proteins. The corresponding GO terms are listed to the right of the heat map. The color gradients represent the Z-score calculated from the L2FC, with blue as downregulated and red as upregulated. Both row and column hierarchical clusters indicate the similarities of the categories.Membrane and soluble proteins involved in the activation of protein kinase activity, regulation of microtubule depolymerization, and cellular detoxification were abundant and notably enriched in root and shoot ( Figure 3C ). Another important observation among proteins less abundant in spaceflight is the enrichment of transport proteins, cargo sorting proteins and vesicle loading proteins ( Supplementary Table A ). Proteins involved in the negative regulation of the cytoskeleton were abundant and highly enriched in spaceflight in both organs ( Supplementary Figures 3, 4 ). It is unclear whether this was a response to spaceflight or a regulator of the response. Specific to the root, proteins involved in DNA topological change, amino acid activation, and regulation of fiber organization were enriched among proteins more abundant in spaceflight while those involved in photoinhibition, cytoskeleton organization, and reactive oxygen species metabolic process were enriched among proteins less abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 3C ). Soluble proteins involved in mitochondrial elongation and the glyoxylate cycle were highly enriched in spaceflight ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) suggesting the compensation of photosynthetic ATP production deficit by increasing metabolic fluxes through the glyoxylate cycle. Further analysis of the photosystems’ proteome supports this suggestion. In the shoot, a large proportion of the enriched proteins are involved in nucleotide metabolic processes, protein synthesis, and localization to several destinations ( Supplementary Figure 5 ). 3.4. Alterations to the photosystems transcriptome and proteome in the spaceflight environment The presence of customizable discrete lighting in the BRIC LED hardware led to the enrichment of several RNA transcripts and proteins involved in the photosynthetic pathways ( Figure 4 , Supplementary Table B ). Interestingly, all the photosystem RNA transcripts differentially expressed in spaceflight were upregulated, whereas most of them became less abundant in both the shoot and root proteomes ( Figure 4 ). This is indicative of post-transcriptional regulation of the photosystem transcripts suggestive of a suppressive adaptation mechanism to reduce light harvesting ability of the photosystems. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Abundance of photosystem RNA transcripts and proteins in spaceflight. The differential abundance of photosynthetic RNA transcript (top) proteins in the root (middle) and shoot (bottom) as determined by their Log2 fold change. The orange color indicates RNA transcripts and proteins that are more abundant in spaceflight, while the blue color indicates RNA transcripts and proteins that are less abundant in spaceflight. Uncolored boxes indicate RNA transcripts and proteins that were not significantly abundant in spaceflight and on Earth. This figure was developed by the KEGG path view. Supporting data can be found in the Supplementary Table B .Common in both organs and more abundant in spaceflight than on earth are PHOTOSYSTEM II PROTEIN D1 (PSBA L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.56, 1.02), a complex that absorbs PSII photoinhibition damages and facilitates the repair of photosystem II, and PPL1 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.61, 1.6) a member of the oxygen-evolving complex. Likewise, ATP SYNTHASE EPSILON CHAIN (ATPBE, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.51, 0.51) was more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth in both organs ( Figure 4 ). The Epsilon subunit of the F-ATPase unit selectively inhibits ATP hydrolysis. This leads to a reduced yield of ATP from photosynthesis. Of the proteins involved in the binding of ferredoxin within the reaction center, only PHOTOSYSTEM, I REACTION CENTER SUBUNIT II-1 (PSAD, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.35, 1.69) was abundant in spaceflight in both organs, while the other member of the complex were less abundant in spaceflight. Less abundant in spaceflight in both organs are the α-subunit of CYTOCHROME B559 (PSBE, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−1.37, −1.81) which reduces susceptibility to high irradiance and PHOTOSYSTEM II CP43 REACTION CENTER PROTEINs (PSBC, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.52, −0.64, PSBB, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.72, −1.20) which serve as the proximal antennae for Photosystem II. Arabidopsis psbe mutants show high susceptibility to strong light damage and reduced plastoquinone pool (Giardi et al., 2013). The decreased abundance of CYTOCHROME F (PETA, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.77, −1.18) in the cytochrome b6/f complex in both organs suggests the exposure of the PSI to high electron influx from the PSII. The FERREDOXIN-NADP(+) OXIDOREDUCTASE-LIKE PROTEIN (PETH, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.2, −0.29), an FNR component of the electron transport in photosystem I and the ATP SYNTHASE subunits (ATPA, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.27, −0.24, ATPB, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.73, −0.8, ATPC1, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.49, −0.77) were also less abundant in spaceflight in both organs ( Figure 4 , Supplementary Table B ). The F-type ATPase subunit drives ATP synthesis, using proton gradient, by allowing passive flux of protons across the membrane, and their reduced abundance in spaceflight coupled with increased ATP hydrolysis inhibition suggests decreased energy production via photosynthesis in spaceflight compared to earth. Notably specific to the root and more abundant in spaceflight are PSBD (L2FCRoot=0.25) and PSBO1 (L2FCRoot=0.5) which are mediators of oxygen evolution (Antonacci et al., 2018). The CYTOCHROME B6-F COMPLEX IRON-SULFUR SUBUNIT (PET C, L2FCShoot=−0.64), a mediator of electron transfer from photosystem II to photosystem I was less abundant in spaceflight and specific to only the shoot ( Figure 4 ). PSAD, PSBA and oxygen evolution complex proteins (PSBO, PPL1 and PSBP) had a significantly higher log2-fold increase in the shoot than in the root ( Figure 4 , Supplementary Table B ), suggesting higher photosynthetic stress in the shoot than root despite equal exposure to light in the BRIC LED hardware. 3.5. Spaceflight alters ionic, molecular, and vesicular transports in both organs Several signaling molecules are delivered to target sites via translocation across different cellular membranes, with most ions moving passively through gated channels and molecules via active transports (Yang and Hinner, 2015). Hence, we decided to assess how the spaceflight environment affected the intracellular transport transcriptome and proteome landscape in Arabidopsis. The RNA transcript and different plant organ proteome had profoundly distinct distributions of upregulated and downregulated intracellular transporters in spaceflight ( Figure 5 ). More ionic, molecular, and vesicular transport pathways were upregulated in spaceflight compared to the downregulated. Common to all the molecular fractions are RNA transcripts and proteins of auxin polar transporters. Likewise, RNA transcripts and proteins involved in the transport of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipids, water, ions, sucrose, and vesicles were upregulated in spaceflight ( Figure 5A ). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Spaceflight enrichment of RNA transcripts and proteins involved in cellular transport. (A). Upregulated RNA and protein in spaceflight (top), downregulated RNA and protein in spaceflight (bottom). RNA transcripts are represented by hashed bars, shoot proteins by black bars and root proteins by dotted bars. (B). Hierarchical clustering tree of enriched RNA transcripts and protein involved in auxin polar transport. The cluster tree for the upregulated auxin transporter term and downregulated auxin transporter term is bottom. Bigger dots indicate more significant p-values. The biological functional characterization was conducted in ShinyGO 0.77, with redundant and/or repeated GO-terms eliminated across the dataset. In the case of overlapping functional groups, the functionality with the highest enrichment is selected.3.5.1. Ionic transport proteins Proteins involved in ionic transport were more abundant in spaceflight across both organs ( Figure 5A , Supplementary Table A ). The abundance of proton and calcium-pump ATPases such as the H+ATPase, (AHA11, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.36, 0.99), V-TYPE PROTON PUMPS (VHAB3, VHA-A2, VHA-D, VHA-F, VHA-G2, VHA-B2 and VHA-C3) and CALCIUM-TRANSPORTING ATPASES (ACA2, ACA4, ACA8) signifies an increased effort towards maintaining cellular homeostasis in spaceflight. The calcium-transporting ATPases regulate intracellular Ca2+ levels and are essential for adaptation to stressful environments. The SODIUM/CALCIUM EXCHANGER (NCL, L2FCRoot=0.36), also involved in the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis and the FERRITINS (FER1, FER3, FER4) were abundant in spaceflight. Ferritins provide the cell with the optimal iron level while maintaining its bioavailability for physiological conditions. The abundance of ferritin in spaceflight suggests a high requirement for iron, either as a form of defense or to protect the DNA against oxidative damage as a result of the abundance of ROS. The organ specificity of some cation transporters is noteworthy ( Supplementary Table A Cation transporters such as CHLORIDE CHANNEL PROTEIN CLC-A (CLC-A, L2FCRoot=0.2), and POTASSIUM TRANSPORTER 13 (POT13, L2FCRoot=0.37) were root-specific. Cation transporters were more abundant in the root in spaceflight than in the shoot ( Supplementary Table A ). This might be indicative of more homeostatic needs in the root than shoot in microgravity. The VACOULAR IRON TRANSPORTER PROTEIN (MEB1, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.4, −0.5) was more abundant in the root but less abundant in the shoot in spaceflight. This further confirms more iron requirements by the root in spaceflight. The CASPARIN STRIP PROTEIN (L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.62, −0.71) was also less abundant in spaceflight. CASPs are thought to direct transport across the plasma membrane by forming a protein scaffold and they also play a role in plant cell wall lignification (Kolbeck et al., 2022). Eleven of the Ras-related family proteins (RABs) were abundant in spaceflight in an organ-specific manner. These small GTP binding proteins function in targeting and tethering transport vesicles to specific acceptor compartments. The RAN GTPASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN (RANGAF, L2FCShoot=−0.42) was less abundant in spaceflight, while two proteins that bind to Ran GTPase homolog (RANBP1B, RANBP1C) were abundant in spaceflight than on earth ( Supplementary Table A ).3.5.2. Vesicular transport Proteins involved in Golgi and Intra-golgi vesicular transport were more enriched on Earth than in spaceflight ( Supplementary Table A ). The majority of the VACUOLAR-SORTING RECEPTORS (VSR1, VSR2, VSR3, VSR4) with the exception of VSR7 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.4, −0.5) were less abundant in spaceflight. The abundance of Ca2+ channel proteins in spaceflight is expected to lead to an abundance of VSRs as cargo binding to VSRs is enhanced by high Ca2+ concentration (Kang and Hwang, 2014), but this was not so. The decreased abundance of CLATHRINE HEAVY CHAIN PROTEIN (CHC2, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.43, −0.41) in spaceflight suggests a decreased endocytosis and vesicle formation in both organs. SYNTAXIN 61 (SYP61, L2FCRoot=−0.33), SYNTAXIN 81 (SYP81, L2FCShoot=−0.57), SYNTAXIN 43 (SYP43, L2FCRoot=−0.57), SYNTAXIN 22 (SYP22, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.46, 1.48) and SYNTAXIN 132 (SYP132, L2FCRoot= 0.34), member of SNARE proteins, were organ-specific in their abundance in spaceflight. The NOVEL PLANT SNARE 11 (NPSN11, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.27, 1.14) was also abundant in both organs in space ( Supplementary Table A ). Synaptotagmins (SYTA L2FCRoot=0.29), a calcium sensor that regulates rapid and synchronous vesicle exocytosis for plant viral movement and a requirement for tethering the ER to the plasma membrane, was also abundant in space.3.5.3. Lipid and hormone transport RNA transcripts and proteins involved in the intracellular transportation of lipids were more enriched and abundant in spaceflight than on Earth ( Figure 5 ). GLYCOLIPID TRANSFER PROTEIN (GTP, L2FCRoot=0.32) and ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 11 (ACD11, L2FCShoot=0.32), involved in sphingolipid transport were abundant in spaceflight in both root and shoot respectively. The abundance of NON-SPECIFIC LIPID-TRANSFER PROTEINS (LTP1, LTP5, LTPG31) and PROTEIN FATTY ACID EXPORT 3 (FAX3, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.32, 0.66) in spaceflight suggests the use of long-distance systemic signaling in space and the formation of lipid polymer barriers. The PHOSPHOLIPID-TRANSPORTING ATPASE 10 (ALA10, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.69, 0.55), a lipid flippase, was abundant in spaceflight. ALA10 is involved in the desaturation process of phosphatidylcholine, a lipid abundant during phosphate starvation and in the regulation of auxin polar transport. The abundance of PATELLINs (PATL2, PATL4, PATL6), regulators of auxin-mediated PIN1 relocation, and AUXIN EFFLUX CARRIERS 3 (PIN3, L2FCRoot=0.49) in spaceflight and the decrease in abundance of the PIN4 (L2FC Root/Shoot=−0.46, −0.75), PIN7(L2FC Root/Shoot=−0.27, −0.84), AUXIN RESPONSE 4 (AXR4, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.34, −0.47), AUXIN TRANSPORTER PROTEIN1 (LAX1, L2FCShoot=−0.74), ABCB1 (L2FCShoot=−0.21) and ABCB20 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.35, −0.65) suggests an alteration in polar auxin redistribution in plants grown in spaceflight ( Figure 5B ). The MYOSINs (XIB, ATM1, XI-H, XI-K, MYA2), which are motor proteins that drive movement along the actin filaments were not significantly abundant (p<0.05) in the shoot in spaceflight but were significantly less abundant in the root. The expression of auxin transporters was organ-specific and this suggested that the distribution of auxin is altered differently in the root and shoot for adaptation to the space environment ( Supplementary Table A ). 3.6. Influence of spaceflight on proteins involved in cell wall synthesis, integrity and maintenance Altered gravity has been identified to have profound effects on the architecture of plant cell walls (Kordyum and Chapman, 2017). Common to both organs and more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth are Endoglucanase 20 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.86, 1.13), involved in the degradation of cellulose to its monomeric subunit, FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINs (FLA 7, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.51, 1.43, and FLA 9, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.73, 0.53) and PLASMA MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED CATION-BINDING PROTEINs (PCAP1, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.49, 0.52 and PCAP2, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.08, 1.47) which are have been implicated in microtubule destabilization and identified as possible regulators of phosphatidylinositol phosphates membrane reformations during intracellular signaling ( Table 2 ). VILLINs (VLN2, VLN3, VLN4), proteins involved in the bundling, severing, nucleating, and capping of the actin cytoskeleton, were also more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth, in both organs ( Table 2 ). Spaceflight alters the biogenesis of microtubules and this is achieved differently in the root and shoot. Table 2. Differentially abundant proteins related to cell wall biosynthesis and maintenance.

CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB, L2FCRoot=−0.4), whose expression reduces the number of microtubules, were root-specific and less in spaceflight ( Table 2 ). β-tubulin dimers (TUBB2, TUBB4, TUBB8, TUBB9) were abundant in spaceflight in the root alone. β-tubulins are more exposed to phosphorylation than α-tubulin which are prone to detyrosination. Modification of tubulin is usually mediated by the tubulin cofactors. The UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs (RGP1, L2FCRoot=0.22 and RGP2, L2FCRoot=0.56) involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides were abundant in the root in spaceflight. Specific to the shoot are the polymers of α-tubulin, TUBA1 (L2FCShoot=−0.78) and TUBA5 (L2FCShoot=−0.3), which were less abundant in spaceflight compared to Earth ( Table 2 ). 3.7. Spaceflight and the plant REDOX homeostasis Regulating the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidants and redox enzymes in plant cells is a key adaptation mechanism for plant survival. ROS are involved in plant systemic signaling, and at the same time can be a result of stress metabolism. Over 132 RNA transcripts and 241 proteins involved in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis and ROS signaling were significantly altered (p<0.05) in spaceflight ( Figure 6 , Supplementary Table C ). While the RNA transcripts included only a few of the traditionally known ROS and ROS-associated genes such as peroxidases, -redoxins, dehydrogenases, and so on, the proteome had many of them. The RNA transcripts involved in the response to ROS pathway differentially expressed in spaceflight include heat shock proteins (HSPs), transcription factors, and ubiquitin ligases ( Figure 6 ). In both organs, 18 of the 20 PEROXIDASE proteins were abundant in spaceflight, indicating a high rate of ROS generation through the reduction of peroxide. Proteins regulating isocitrate metabolism, AC01 (L2FCRoot=0.33), ACO3 (L2FCRoot=0.57), CICDH (L2FCRoot=0.54), and IDH5 (L2FCShoot=0.43) were more abundant in spaceflight than on earth. The isocitrate pathway is the branchpoint of many other metabolic pathways in plants and the abundance of the Isocitrate dehydrogenase NAD+ catalytic enzymes suggests that plants in spaceflight environments use the isocitrate pathway to supplement NADPH generation from the pentose phosphate pathway. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Redox homeostasis in spaceflight. Heatmap of GO enrichment terms (molecular and biological) of RNA transcripts, shoot proteins, and root proteins involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress and maintenance of redox homeostasis. The color gradient represents the significance of the enrichment of the genes and proteins in the metabolic pathway indicated by the right side of the plot.SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, FSD1 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.9, 0.99), FSD3 (L2FC Shoot=0.31) and THIOREDOXIN REDUCTASE (NTRA, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.0, 193) were abundant in spaceflight and they facilitate the removal of superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner. A vacuolar phosphatase (PAP26, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.43, 0.76) involved in the recycling of inorganic phosphate from intracellular phosphate metabolite (Veljanovski et al., 2006) was more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth. Enriched in the spaceflight environment are proteins (PGD1, TKL-2, NADP-ME2, and G6PD1), recognized as major participants of the pentose-phosphate shunt pathway ( Supplementary Table C ). The pentose phosphate shunt pathway is a parallel alternative to the glycolysis pathway. Surprisingly, both RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG PROTEIN D (RBOHD, L2FCShoot=−0.67) and L-ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 3, L2FCShoot=−0.95) were less abundant in spaceflight in the shoot. The RBOHD produces ROS in response to environmental stress and plant signaling. Here, roots seem to be more impacted by oxidative stress and abundance of ROS than shoots in spaceflight ( Supplementary Table C ).",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion 4.1. Arabidopsis adapts photosystems to the spaceflight environment to minimize impacts on photosynthesis This study assesses the physiological and molecular impacts of the spaceflight environment on Arabidopsis seedlings grown in NASA BRIC LED hardware using a combined transcriptomics and proteomics approach. The BRIC LED hardware, with integrated LED illumination, provides the growing seedlings with a source of light. Hence, plants growing in the BRIC LED hardware on ISS will have light cues but lack gravitational cues. This enabled us to study the effects of microgravity on plant transcriptome and organ-specific proteome, while also providing insight into how the plant root and shoot individually integrate light signaling in the absence of gravity. Evidence from this study suggests that the operations of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) were greatly impacted in spaceflight ( Figure 4 ), with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. While the net photosynthetic rate might not be affected in microgravity as it was not captured in this study, the molecular functions of the photosynthetic apparatus, as revealed by this study, were impacted. The abundance of the NusG-like proteins (PTAC12, PTAC14, PTAC3, PTAC4) in the shoot and NusG-like proteins (PTAC16, PTAC14) in the root ( Supplementary Table D ) suggests attempts at boosting the translational efficiency of chloroplast ribosomes to reduce the plant sensitivity to environmental stress in spaceflight. The abundance of D1 complex protein (PSBA) and the PPL1 in spaceflight suggests attempts to optimize the water-oxidizing reaction and repair damages to the PSII. Reduced abundance of the PSAB and PSAE isoforms of the PSI in spaceflight, signifies an increased susceptibility of the PSII to photoinhibition (Krieger-Liszkay et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2022) and a deficiency of the PSI steady state redox-level and re-oxidation. The PPL1, which was abundant in spaceflight in both organs, works to facilitate the assembly of PSII and optimize plant fitness under increased sensitivity to the BRIC LED hardware light. Suppression of the PSI electron transport subunit protein, PETH, in spaceflight, is associated with reduced efficiency of the electron transport chain and instability of the PSI. However, this reduced efficiency is compensated for by an increased abundance of chloroplast gene translations (PTACs), which helps to prevent over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool. The reduced abundance of PSII proximal antennae protein cp43 (PSBC) and the light-harvesting chlorophyll complexes (LHCB1, LHCB4, LHCB5, LHCB6) in spaceflight suggest an attempt to decrease light harvest by the photosystems, hence decrease photoinhibition, increase the oxygen-evolving capability and improve repair to PSII. Varying degrees of molecular perturbations to the plant photosystem complexes in spaceflight have earlier been reported, which further validate our findings (Stutte et al., 2005; Chen and Wang, 2016; Vandenbrink et al., 2019). However, unlike in this current study, where PSII and PSI complexes transcripts (RNA) were upregulated in spaceflight, Vandenbrink et al. (2019) reported significant downregulation of transcripts enriched in photosynthetic pathways in spaceflight compared to ground samples. They also indicated the downregulation of four RNA transcripts associated with photosynthetic electron transport (petE: plastocyanin, petF: ferredoxin, petH: ferredoxin–NADP+ reductase, petJ: cytochrome c6). These transcripts were however upregulated in spaceflight in our current study, but they were all downregulated at the proteome level in both the plant root and shoot ( Figure 4 ). These discrepancies at the transcript level may be due to the difference in Arabidopsis wildtype ecotypes and spaceflight hardware utilized in both experiments. While Vandenbrink et al. (2019) utilized the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsberg and the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) hardware, this study utilized the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 and the BRIC LED hardware. Basu et al. (2017) and Olanrewaju et al. (2023) emphasize that the choice of hardware is a significant source of variations in the results of plant spaceflight experiments transcriptomics and proteomics. Chen and Wang (2016) delineated another tangent by revealing that out of 38 photosystem-associated proteins that exhibited differential expression in spaceflight-grown rice seedlings, 34 were downregulated in spaceflight compared to Earth controls. While our findings and that of Vandenbrink et al. (2019) support the coherent perturbation of both the PSII and PS I as revealed by the transcriptome and proteome, Chen and Wang (2016) suggested from their fluorescent emission spectra studies that despite the changes to the PSII proteins in spaceflight, their activity under microgravity is not affected, in contrast with the PSI which had significantly reduced energy transfer rates, hence impaired photosynthetic activity. Of course, Chen and Wang (2016) study was carried out on Rice seedlings, not Arabidopsis and directly extrapolating the differential PS I and PSII findings to Arabidopsis might not be so efficient. However, a consensus is that the spaceflight environment leads to a reduction in the PS I and PSII complexes, which may be accompanied by reduced photosynthetic efficiency and consequent smaller plant tissues. The expression of the photosynthesis-associated proteins in the root might be due to the architecture of the BRIC LED hardware, which places the LEDs in close proximity to the roots, making them prone to direct hit by light. Interestingly, Paul et al. (2013) also reported the expression of several genes involved in light regulation in Arabidopsis roots in spaceflight transcriptomics experiments, even when the roots were not in close proximity to light. This phenomenon was also observed by Kruse et al. (2020) in their whole seedling transcriptomics study, despite that the seedlings were grown in the total absence of light cue in spaceflight. Hence, it is suggested that when gravity is absent, plant roots rely more heavily on negative phototropism for navigation, inducing light-sensing “tools” in roots in the spaceflight environment (Paul et al., 2017). The proteome landscape of the root and shoot, however, differs significantly in spaceflight, suggesting different adaptation mechanisms to the space environment, a further confirmation of Paul et al. (2013) transcriptomic study’s observation of organ-specificity in plant response to spaceflight. Vandenbrink et al. (2016) also proposed an interaction between plants’ gravity and light harvesting machinery at a genetic level, based on their observations of blue-light phototropic response in roots of Arabidopsis grown in microgravity. The upregulation of most of the photosystem and contrasting decreased abundance of corresponding proteins in spaceflight ( Figure 4 ) however, suggests that major adaptive response to spaceflight environmental stimulus might be regulated at the post-transcriptional level, even though the direct effect of the stimulus is still observed at the transcriptional level. A combined translatome-proteome study approach will be useful to elucidate this phenomenon. 4.2. Intracellular trafficking and cell wall synthesis in spaceflight Plants, throughout their evolutionary history, have developed remarkable adaptations to counteract the unrelenting force of gravity (Medina et al., 2021). To withstand the gravitational force, plants have to ensure a balance between the internal turgor pressure, mediated by intracellular trafficking, and tensile resistance of both the primary and secondary cell walls. One pivotal molecular insight is the potential shift in cellulose metabolism in spaceflight, as indicated by the heightened abundance of Endoglucanase 20. Enhanced cellulose degradation might be a strategic adaptation, possibly optimizing cell wall flexibility in response to the unique stresses of a microgravity environment. This could be complemented by shifts in cellular adhesion dynamics, given the altered levels of FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINs. The implications of these shifts could range from altered tissue integrity to modifications in intercellular communication. In a comprehensive transcriptomics meta-analysis of Arabidopsis plants cultivated in spaceflight within the BRIC Petri-dish fixation unit (PDFU) hardware, Johnson et al. (2017) highlighted potential alterations in the cell wall matrix of plants in spaceflight, as revealed by the glycomics evaluation of the BRIC-16-Cyt samples. They implied that microgravity influences the biosynthesis of xylan and pectic elements, leading to variations in the composition of the cell wall matrix. Alongside this, Johnson et al. (2017) also reported the reduced abundance of xylan and pectic epitopes in spaceflight-grown plants, which resonate with our findings, highlighting the potential changes in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides in spaceflight conditions, particularly in the root. Nakashima et al. (2023) in their novel glycome profiling and immunohistochemistry of Arabidopsis in spaceflight also observed that roots from spaceflight Arabidopsis seedlings displayed a generally increased labeling intensity when targeted with xyloglucan monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) compared to ground controls. They concluded that the heightened fluorescence intensity post-labeling with xyloglucan mAbs might result from changes in polysaccharide biosynthesis and secretion due to microgravity conditions. Wakabayashi et al. (2020) in their studies on Rice seedling cell wall under spaceflight conditions indicated that microgravity reduces the 1,3:1,4-β-glucan content in rice shoot cell walls, implicating an increase in the expression of an endo-1,3:1,4-β-glucanase gene. This reduction might serve to keep the cell wall more flexible under microgravity conditions. This observation is in harmony with our data, revealing potential changes in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight environments. Interestingly, while these studies reported that glucan metabolism is impacted, the spaceflight environment (microgravity) seems to exert minimal influence on the metabolism of arabinoxylans. This differentiation in response indicates a level of specificity in how plants adjust their cell wall components in response to altered gravity. In the absence of gravity, seedlings have to default to secondary signals such as other environmental impulses. This affects internal homeostasis, inter- and intra-cellular transports, and cell wall composition. Our results identified intracellular Ca2+ transport as a major player in adaptation to microgravity in both root and shoot. This is characterized by the increased abundance of the vacuolar proton ATPases and calcium-transporting ATPases. The vacuolar ATPases, contributing to the cytosolic pH homeostasis, form electrochemical proton gradients and drive active transport into cell organelles and they are important targets of phosphorylation and redox modification. The root-specific abundance of the cation transporters suggests that the homeostatic needs of the root differ from that of the shoot in spaceflight. The altered abundance of small GTPases such as Ran, Rab, and Ras, between spaceflight and Earth suggests a functional dysregulation of vesicle trafficking in spaceflight. The spaceflight environment alters molecular switches between the membrane-bound active GTP and cytosolic inactive GDP which tremendously affects signal transduction. Molecular mechanisms driving polar auxin distribution were affected and organ-specific, with the altered abundance of auxin transporters in spaceflight and on Earth. However, auxin transport and response appear to be more pronounced on Earth than in microgravity. Results from this study also suggest a decreased stability of the cellulose cell wall in spaceflight, due to the abundance of cellulose-degrading proteins and less abundance of cellulose synthase ( Table 2 ). The spaceflight environment led to the decreased formation and increased destabilization of the microtubules which suggests that seedlings seem to fall back on the actin skeleton for support. Interactions between PIP2 which is abundant in space, with VILLINs which were also abundant in space inhibit the capping and severing actions of actin but rather increase actin binding at the headpiece region. This suggests that actin cross-nucleation and cross-linking is an adaptation mechanism for plants in space. An in-depth study into vesicle and cargo sorting under microgravity will give more insight into how plants adapt their intracellular trafficking and cell wall depositions to the spaceflight environment. 4.3. Spaceflight significantly affects plant translation machinery in an organ-specific pattern The varied abundance of over 150 ribosomal subunit proteins, spliceosomes and proteasomes in spaceflight and across both organs suggest major alterations to plant transcriptional and translation machinery as an adaptation mechanism to the spaceflight environment ( Supplementary Tables E, F ). The decreased abundance of various mRNA slicing factors (ATO, CUV, SC35, SCL30A, U2AF65A, U2AF65B, DEAH3) in the shoot in spaceflight suggests less mRNA splicing in the shoot compared to the root, which might lead to the abundance of non-functional proteins in the shoot and increased need for proteasome activities. Combining transcript data with this proteome data will give more insight into this. The abundance of HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN families (HS60, HSP70, HSP90) in both organs suggests an increased control of protein homeostasis in space characterized by folding of nascent polypeptides released from the ribosome, sorting of proteins to cell organelles and providing a link to the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. The relative abundance of 26S proteasomes involved in the degradation of misfolded and orphaned proteins suggests that the spaceflight environment led to errors in protein translation, hence the need to increase the efficiency of the proteasome unit. 4.4. Combating oxidative stress while maintaining ROS signaling in spaceflight Seedlings in spaceflight are faced with the need to maintain a balance between the abundance of ROS for systemic stress signaling and their damaging effects. Our results suggest dedicated efforts to the removal of superoxide radicals by the abundance of several peroxides, thioredoxin, ferritin, and superoxide dismutase in spaceflight. We infer that plants in spaceflight utilize a shunt pathway, which is a parallel alternative to the glycolytic pathway, to complement the NADPH production from the pentose-phosphate pathway. The pentose-phosphate shunt pathway is driven by NADPH demands in different tissues (Aziz and Mohiuddin, 2022), and in this extremity, plants in spaceflight recycle inorganic phosphate from intracellular phosphate metabolites in the vacuole, mediated by PAP26 to meet the NADPH demands. This suggests that the metabolic energy requirement for plants in space is higher than on Earth. The abundance of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and several glutathione dehydrogenases suggests the involvement of the S-nitrosation reaction in cellular homeostasis in spaceflight. A common feature of the ALDHs is the susceptibility of their catalytic cysteine residue to GSNO-mediated S-nitrosation (Stiti et al., 2020), which has been suggested as a central gravitropism signaling event (Kruse and Wyatt, 2022). While this study substantiates that the BRIC LED hardware supports Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight, it is important to note that the BRIC hardware, unlike some newly developed advanced spaceflight hardware such as the Advance Plant Habitat (APH), is a closed system, hence no gas exchange between the plant and the external environment. This is a major limitation for the hardware, as this promotes the buildup of gases such as ethylene, oxygen and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Klymchuk et al., 2003). Despite being an important hormone to plant, elevated ethylene level had been identified to cause anomalous Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight (Stankovic, 2018) and sterility in male wheat plants grown in spaceflight (Campbell et al., 2001). Beyond ethylene, the accumulation of oxygen and other VOCs can potentially reach toxic levels in the BRIC LED hardware. This is a substantial source of stress as indicated by Basu et al. (2017). Drawing parallels with Earth, closed environments like terrariums might encounter similar challenges with gas accumulation. However, there’s a critical difference. On Earth, natural processes and microbial interactions often intervene to balance out the system over time. But in the unique microgravity setting of space, these natural balancing acts might not function as they do here, thereby amplifying the challenges of a closed system, as we consider plants for bio-regenerative life support in long-term spaceflight missions. 4.5. Non-correlated transcriptome and proteome: indicative of post-transcriptional regulation in spaceflight? Spaceflight environmental conditions pose unique challenges to plants, leading to significant alterations in gene expression and protein synthesis. Our analysis of Arabidopsis plants grown in space reveals that the expression of RNA transcripts did not correspond to their translation to shoot and root proteins. The observed non-correlation between transcriptome and proteome data from Arabidopsis plants grown in spaceflight may indeed suggest a prevalent post-transcriptional regulation (Wang et al., 2022). Transcript-protein discordance can be attributed to multiple factors. One such factor is the differential extraction protocols and data processing for RNA and protein, which can introduce variation in the extracted quantities (Liu et al., 2016). Furthermore, due to the unique environmental stressors of spaceflight, the mechanisms to arrest translation could be compromised, resulting in skewed protein synthesis rates. Moreover, the phenomenon of alternative splicing, often upregulated under stress conditions, can result in multiple protein isoforms from a single transcript, further complicating the correlation. Another source of discordance to note is that the RNA transcriptome might be a reflection of the plant’s immediate response to stress, while the proteome represents a more stabilized, adaptive response. These unique constraints of spaceflight can thus evoke distinct reactions at plants’ transcriptome and proteome levels, leading to non-correlated outcomes. Hence, attributing the non-correlation of the transcriptome and proteome only to alternative splicing will be a bias. This study, by combining transcriptomics and proteomics, provided insight into plants’ adaptive responses to the spaceflight environment at multiple molecular levels. While we did not directly measure photosynthetic net production, our findings indicate a series of modifications to photosystems II and I aimed at adapting to the space environment, potentially decreasing the plant’s sensitivity to light intensity and enhancing its oxygen-evolving capacity. Concurrently, we observed evidence for an increased metabolic energy requirement in spaceflight, with plants seemingly engaging alternate energy generation pathways to complement photosynthetic production. Furthermore, our findings indicate significant impacts on cellular trafficking and potential compromises to cell wall integrity, suggesting an adaptation in structural support provided by actin filament cross-linking and cross-nucleation. This research not only serves as a comprehensive study of plant response in spaceflight but also holds profound implications for terrestrial agriculture, providing valuable insights for developing crop varieties resilient to environmental stressors on Earth, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and salinity. This study also contributes to the broader goal of space agriculture – a key component of long-duration space missions and off-Earth colonization. While centered around the model plant Arabidopsis, our findings could provide the foundation for developing crop varieties suitable for growth in extraterrestrial environments, supporting food production for future missions to Mars and the Moon. Thus, the findings of our research, while intrinsically fascinating, also bear practical implications for the future of both terrestrial and space agriculture. As we continue to explore the final frontier, understanding how life – in this case, plant life – adapts and thrives is crucial for the success of our extraterrestrial endeavors and the sustainable development of our agriculture on Earth.",

Copyright notice ID: 10712242 PMID: 38089794 Abstract Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µg) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space. Keywords: spaceflight, gravitropism, Arabidopsis, proteomics, RNAseq, TMT, BRIC LED, International Space Station1. Introduction Numerous plant spaceflight studies have long focused on unraveling the complex physiological changes plants undergo in the spaceflight environment. In their diversity, these studies have accumulated an extensive array of phenotypic characterizations and uncovered some of the fundamental concepts related to physiological adaptation in space (Kordyum and Hasenstein, 2021). However, the traditional approaches have recently been complemented and in many ways superseded by the advent of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic methods, setting the stage for high throughput analyses that investigates the effects of spaceflight on plants from a molecular and functional perspective (Hughes and Kiss, 2022). This allows the physiological effects of the spaceflight environment to be characterized beyond phenotyping and extensively mapped out along broader biochemical pathways and cryptic signaling molecular cascades. While some remarkable advancements in genomic and transcriptomics studies of plants in spaceflight have been widely recorded (Ferl et al., 2002; Paul et al., 2012; Barker et al., 2023), such studies have largely been conducted in isolation, independent of proteomics. Unlike genomic and transcriptomic studies, proteomics studies face certain limitations in the spaceflight context, predominantly due to the limited availability of plant tissues for analysis. As a result, comprehensive spaceflight proteomics studies conducted on the whole Arabidopsis plant have been relatively few, with only three reported so far (Mazars et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015; Barker et al., 2020; Kruse et al., 2020). Mazars et al. (2014) conducted the first true proteomics-scale study of Arabidopsis microsome-associated membrane proteins on the ISS followed by Hausmann et al. (2014) study on the proteome of Arabidopsis cell cultures in parabolic flights and Zhang et al. (2015) proteomic study on Arabidopsis callus aboard the Chinese SZ-8 spacecraft in spaceflight. Ferl et al. (2015) comparison of the transcriptome and protein abundances between the leaf and root of Arabidopsis in spaceflight represented the first use of a combined transcriptomics-proteomics investigative approach for whole plant spaceflight experiment, followed by a similar but more in-depth approach by Kruse et al. (2020) where they revealed novel regulatory responses of Arabidopsis seedlings in spaceflight. Reports from these two multi-omics studies indicated that the true power of omics approaches becomes apparent when they are combined, providing a comprehensive view of how gene expression and protein synthesis respond to the unique conditions of spaceflight. Likewise, the reported low correlation between transcripts and proteome of Arabidopsis grown in spaceflight and spaceflight hardware (Basu et al., 2017; Kruse et al., 2017; Kruse et al., 2020) reinforced the benefits of a multi-omics approach. Studying plants’ adaptation to the spaceflight environment usually involves plants being flown to the ISS in designated hardware, whose designs and subsequent improvements are often based on the objectives of the experiment at hand (Kanapskyte et al., 2021; Nicholson et al., 2021). One such hardware is the Biological Research In Canister – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED). BRIC LED hardware is designed to enhance the capabilities of existing BRIC Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFU) by the incorporation of a customizable discreet lighting system. Hence, biological organisms growing in the BRIC LED hardware are illuminated by LEDs with options of four different wavelengths (blue, red, far-red, and white) (Howard and Caron, 2016). Spaceflight experiments in the BRIC LED hardware expose plants to light cues in microgravity, hence closely simulating a natural environment where plants have to simultaneously integrate light and gravitational signaling. The incorporation of weightlessness and light signaling is expected to elicit several physiological and molecular responses which are distinct from other hardware without a light source (Stankovic, 2018), with the responses often novel and a function of cross-talks among various signaling pathways rather than an individual signal transduction pathway. Tightly regulated by complex cross-signaling pathways, the responses are usually specific to each plant organ and most times, tissues (Wolinska and Berens, 2019). Transcripts and proteomes encoding these stress response pathways are usually localized to a particular intracellular or extracellular region, further reinforcing the idea that studies on plant stress response should be focused on finer resolutions of organs, tissues, cells, and organelles. Several studies have identified that the plant root and shoot respond in an organ-specific manner to gravity (Paul et al., 2013; Vandenbrink et al., 2014; Lamers et al., 2020) and other environmental stresses (Paponov et al., 2021). Hence, resolving plant proteomic responses to the spaceflight environment on an organ-specific level is a step further in understanding stress response signaling pathways and the molecular adaptations of each plant organ to the spaceflight environment and how such adaptation mechanisms can be manipulated for improved plant production in space and on earth. Therefore, building upon these previous achievements in plant multi-omics research in spaceflight, we took a significant step forward by integrating both proteomics and transcriptomics approaches to understand the response of Arabidopsis plants to the spaceflight environment. Through increased coverage and finer spatial proteomic resolution, we assessed the effects of the earth’s low orbit spaceflight environment aboard the ISS on the shoot and root of the Arabidopsis seedlings. The seedlings were grown in the NASA BRIC LED hardware, hence we provided robust insight into the plant transcriptome landscape and organ-specific proteomic responses of Arabidopsis to the spaceflight environment, while at the same time conducting a hardware verification test for the novel BRIC LED hardware.2. Materials and methods 2.1. Plant material and spaceflight growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana L., ecotype Columbia-0 seeds were surface sterilized with 30% (v/v) bleach, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 for 2 mins, washed repeatedly with sterile water (5×) and dried on round filter paper. Approximately 30 seeds were plated on each 60mm round petri plate containing 6.7ml of 0.5× + Benomyl Murashige and Skoog (MS) growth media with Gamborg’s B5 vitamins, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.75% (w/v) phytagel, and cold stratified for 16h. Seeded plates were loaded in a horizontal orientation, with the face of the growth media parallel to the ground in the BRIC LED hardware petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Each hardware canister holds 6 PDFUs, with each PDFU holding a 60mm petri plate. This configuration was replicated 6 times, making a total of 36 seeded 60mm plates loaded aboard ISS. All BRICs were kept in cold storage (4°C) prior to the spaceflight launch. The experiment was flown on the SpaceX CRS-13 mission launched aboard the Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket on December 15, 2017. The dormant Arabidopsis seeds were activated with light and placed at ambient temperature aboard the ISS, with a light wavelength composition of 85% red, 15% blue, and 60 µmol m−2 s−1 intensity. The plants were grown for 10 days with a 4-hour/2-hour light-dark cycle, prior to actuation of the PDFUs, releasing about 6–7ml RNAlater into the petri plates for seedling fixation. The seedlings were then incubated in Invitrogen RNAlater for 12 hours after which they were frozen aboard the ISS MELFI at −80°C until returned to Earth on May 5, 2018, aboard the SpaceX CRS-14 cargo dragon. A similar experimental setup was established on the ground, for same duration, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the Space Station Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber, USA. The samples were transported on dry ice from the dragon capsule to the receiving laboratories. Frozen plates containing both the spaceflight and ground samples were packed in dry ice and transported to Ohio University where they were stored at −80°C prior to protein extraction and processing while another group was also sent to the University of Florida, Gainesville for RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing.2.2. RNA extraction and sequencing For each condition (Spaceflight and Ground), four individual plants from each replicate were pooled for RNA extraction. Individual plants were first dissected into leaves, hypocotyls, and root tissues under an Olympus dissecting microscope (Olympus, Japan). The intervening hypocotyls were set aside and not processed for downstream analyses. Leaf tissues without their hypocotyl are referred to herein as shoots and are the only ones processed for RNA analysis. RNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA concentration was assessed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), and RNA quality was determined on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). For all samples, the RNA integrity number (RIN) was more than 6. RNA-Sequencing Library Preparation was performed at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) Gene Expression Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/gene-expression-genotyping/ RRID: SCR_019145). Here, 100 ng of total RNA was used for mRNA isolation using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7490). Next, RNA library construction was done with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7760) according to the manufacturer’s user guide. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94°C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primer. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 12 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog #A63881). The 12 barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these 20 individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 was used to sequence the libraries for 2 × 150 cycles. Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing (https://biotech.ufl.edu/next-gen-dna/, RRID: SCR_019152). Normalized libraries were submitted to the “Free Adapter Blocking Reagent” protocol (FAB, catalog #20024145) to minimize the presence of adaptor-dimers and index hopping rates. The library pool was diluted to 0.8 nM and sequenced on one S4 flow cell lane (2 × 150 cycles) of the Illumina NovaSeq6000. The instrument’s computer utilized the NovaSeq Control Software v1.6. Cluster and SBS consumables were v1.5. The final loading concentration of the library was 120 pM with 1% PhiX (v/v) spike-in control. One lane generated 2.5–3 billion paired-end reads (~950Gb) with an average Q30%≥92.5% and Cluster PF=85.4%. FastQ files were generated using the BCL2fastQ function in the Illumina BaseSpace portal. One NovaSeq S4, 2 × 150 cycles lane resulted in an average of 50 million demultiplexed, paired-end reads when sequencing a pool of 48 samples.2.3. Protein extraction, sample processing and LC-MS/MS Seedlings from spaceflight and ground controls were divided into root and shoot for soluble and membrane protein extractions according to a protocol adapted from Basu et al. (2015). Approximately 0.1g of tissue per replicate was crushed in liquid nitrogen and vortexed thoroughly in the extraction buffer. The samples were subsequently centrifuged at 8000g and 100,000g to isolate membrane protein. Both the precipitated soluble protein stored in methanol and the membrane protein in microsome resuspension buffer were sent to the Proteomics and Metabolomics Facility, at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln for 6-plex TMT labeling and mass spectrometric analysis ( Supplementary protocol ).2.4. Data analysis RNA read pairs for each biological replicate for the flight and ground control samples were checked for sequence quality using the FastQC, trimmed using the TrimGalore, and aligned to TAIR10 assembly using the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) (Kruse et al., 2020). Determination of gene-level read counts was accomplished using the Feature-count tool while the differential expression was determined using the negative binomial generalized linear model likelihood tests with the DESeq2 package in R. LC-MS/MS peptide data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) using the Sequest HT search engine. Peptides were validated by Percolator with a 0.01 posterior error probability (PEP) threshold (Rioseras et al., 2018). The data were searched using a decoy database to set the false discovery rate to 1% (high confidence). Protein quantification was processed using the co-isolation threshold set to 50% and the average S/N to 10, and peptides were quantified using the peak intensity of the reporter ions in the MS3 spectra. The peak abundance was normalized for differences in sample loading using total peptide amount where the peptide group abundances are summed for each sample and the maximum sum across all runs is determined. The protein ratios and log2 fold changes (L2FC) were calculated from the grouped protein abundances. RNA transcripts and Proteins with adjusted p-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant while thresholds of L2FC≥1 or ≤−1 and L2FC≥0.2 or ≤−0.2 were established for the RNA and protein respectively to decide differential abundance between spaceflight and earth.2.5. Analysis of the gene ontology enrichment Analysis of the gene ontology (GO) enrichment was performed using the ShinyGO V0.77 (based on Ensembl Release 107 with revision, archived on April 4, 2022) (Ge et al., 2020) and confirmed using the DAVID database (Sherman et al., 2022). Only differentially abundant (p<0.05) RNA and proteins with significant abundance in spaceflight (L2FC≥1 and L2FC≥0.2 respectively) or significant abundance on earth (L2FC≤−1 and L2FC≤−0.2 respectively) were analyzed for fold enrichment. The GO term filter condition was set at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 and p-values (ratio of total genes involved in a pathway found in the dataset to total genes in the pathway) were adjusted by the Benjamini–Hochberg (B–H) method to reduce false positives. Hence, poorly represented annotated terms and overly broad terms in the protein dataset were eliminated. Likewise, a comparison was drawn between the araPath enrichment terms (Lai et al., 2012) and STRINGdb (www.https://string-db.org/) terms in the dataset to ensure we get an accurate overview of the GO enrichment. In cases where we have similar enrichment terms, only the most informative terms, with fewer similarities and the highest enrichment value were retained. Visual representations of the resulting enrichment terms were created using the graph tools on ShinyGO and the “ggplot”, “GOsummaries” and “Heatmap” packages in RStudio (Posit team, 2023).2.6. Confirmation of subcellular localization The subcellular locations of differentially abundant (p<0.05) RNA and proteins in spaceflight and on the ground were analyzed using the Subcellular Localization Database for Arabidopsis Proteins (SUBA4, http://suba.live, accessed May 2023). Specific protein consensus subcellular localizations were decided using the SUBAcon (Hooper et al., 2014), a consensus algorithm for unifying the subcellular localization data of the Arabidopsis proteome. The resulting subcellular localizations were plotted on a sunburst chart.3. Results 3.1. Transcriptomics and proteomics recovery in the BRIC LED experiment The differential analysis of the transcriptome expressed between spaceflight and ground control Arabidopsis samples yielded 15,505 distinctly mapped RNA transcripts, with 2,474 being statistically significant at adjusted p<0.05. Of this, 195 RNA are upregulated in spaceflight at L2FCRNA≥1, while 761 are downregulated in spaceflight at L2FCRNA≤−1 ( Figure 1A ). Protein extraction from the different organs (root and shoot) and across the cellular fractions (soluble and membrane) led to the quantification, in the root, of 20,923 peptides mapped to 3973 membrane proteins and 18,636 peptides mapped to 3412 soluble proteins. Similar to this, in the shoot, 20,658 peptides were mapped to 3965 membrane proteins and 20,091 peptides were mapped to 3537 soluble proteins. Only proteins with a FDR of 0.01 and a minimum of two uniquely mapped non-nested peptides (amino acid length >6 were retained. Proteins with B–H adjusted p≤0.05 were identified as statistically significant in the dataset. A total of 2187 membrane proteins and 332 soluble proteins were statistically significant in the root, while 1856 membrane proteins and 476 soluble proteins were statistically significant in the shoot. At the decision thresholds of L2FCprotein≥0.2 and L2FCprotein≤−0.2, 821 membrane proteins and 135 soluble proteins in the root were more abundant in spaceflight, whereas 1199 membrane proteins and 162 soluble proteins were less abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 1A ). Likewise, in the shoot, 1031 and 270 membrane and soluble proteins respectively were less abundant in spaceflight compared to ground control, while 778 membrane proteins and 172 soluble proteins were more abundant in spaceflight compared to ground control ( Figure 1A ). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Transcriptome and proteome recovery in BRIC LED experiment. (A). Bar plots of the RNA and protein abundance distribution in spaceflight and in ground control. On the protein plots, solid-colored bars represent the membrane proteins while hashed bars represent the soluble protein. The quantity of differentially abundant RNA and proteins (p<0.05) is indicated in parentheses. RNA and proteins with L2FCRNA≥1 and L2FCprotein≥0.2 respectively were considered abundant in spaceflight while those with L2FCRNA≤−1 and L2FCprotein≤−0.2 respectively were considered less abundant in space. (B). Volcano plot of the total abundance and distribution of RNA and proteins between spaceflight and ground tissues. The negative log of the adjusted p-values was plotted on the y-axis against the normalized log2 fold change on the x-axis. Dots represent RNA and protein abundance with black dots representing non-significantly expressed proteins (p>0.05 and those with L2FC not within the threshold), red dots represent less abundant RNA and proteins in spaceflight while blue dots represent proteins that were more abundant in spaceflight than on earth. (C). Venn diagram of differential protein abundance in spaceflight. Combination of differential proteins more abundant in spaceflight and less abundant in spaceflight, as distinct to each organ and as shared by both organs. Shoot UP indicates shoot proteins more abundant in spaceflight, shoot DOWN indicates shoot proteins less abundant in spaceflight, Root UP indicates root proteins more abundant in spaceflight while root DOWN indicates root proteins less abundant in spaceflight.The volcano plot ( Figure 1B ) of the total mapped RNA and protein across the organs and cell fractions gives a broader view of the pattern of abundance of transcriptome and proteome in spaceflight. Applying the widely accepted threshold for RNA tier II analysis, L2FCRNA≥1 or L2FCRNA≤−1, reduces false positives in interpreting the biological significance of the differentially expressed transcripts (McDermaid et al., 2019). However, this also led to the exclusion of over 61% of our total statistically significant transcripts ( Figure 1B ), with the possibility of the exclusion of some transcripts with biological significance. Membrane proteins were more differentially abundant (p<0.05) and highly perturbed in spaceflight compared to the soluble proteins. Membrane proteins in the root had the largest abundance and fold enrichment, followed by the membrane and soluble proteins in the shoots respectively, while soluble proteins in the root were the least quantified and least differentially abundant ( Figure 1B ). Several studies (Sarasketa et al., 2016; Paponov et al., 2021) have identified specificity in the proteomic profile of root and shoot in response to various environmental perturbations such as magnetic field, hormonal homeostasis, and gravity. This study further provides insight into how the specific plant organs (root and shoot) respond to microgravity in spaceflight. The organ-targeted proteomic profiling in response to microgravity, in this study, revealed that roots and shoots adapt differently to the spaceflight environment, and at the same time, they share certain commonalities. Comparing root-specific protein abundance in spaceflight to Earth, 400 membrane proteins and 75 soluble proteins were more abundant in space, whereas 606 membrane proteins and 71 soluble proteins were less abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 1C ). For proteins specific to the shoot, 357 membrane, and 112 soluble proteins were more abundant in spaceflight, whereas 438 membrane and 179 soluble proteins were less abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 1C ). Common to both root and shoot, 421 membrane proteins and 60 soluble proteins were more abundant in spaceflight compared to on Earth. Likewise, the abundance of 593 membrane proteins and 91 soluble proteins was reduced in spaceflight across both organs. Interestingly, a comparison of the differentially abundant proteins shared by both organs revealed that 18 membrane proteins were more abundant in spaceflight in the root and less abundant in the shoot, while 34 membrane proteins were more abundant in spaceflight in the shoot and less abundant in the root ( Figure 1C , Table 1 ). A GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of the 34 membrane proteins with increased abundance in the shoot and decreased abundance in the root in spaceflight revealed that they were majorly involved in the photosynthetic pathway, carbon metabolism pathway, and amide biosynthetic process. Likewise, these proteins were majorly chloroplast localized and are enriched for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) phosphorylating activity, poly(U) RNA binding, and oxidoreductase activity ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). KEGG pathway analysis of the 18 membrane proteins that were more abundant in spaceflight in the root and less abundant in the shoot did not indicate their involvements in a major metabolic pathway. However, some of these proteins were the heat shock proteins (HSP70, HSP90.4), host defense proteins such as the Importin (IMPA-4) and Pectinesterase inhibitor 17 (PME17), proteins involved in shunt energy processes such as the Transketolase (TLK2) and Electron Transfer flavoprotein (ETFQ).

Subcellular distribution and abundance of protein in spaceflight Several metabolic processes in cells, such as signal transduction, transport of molecules, cell division, cell death, etc., are tightly linked with the location of specific transcripts and proteins (Christopher et al., 2022). Transcripts are targeted toward different subcellular organelles in the plant cell based on the specific functions of encoded proteins. Assessing which of the targeted organelles have the highest amount of perturbed proteins gives insight into the metabolic process most affected by the spaceflight environment. Our expectation is that since transcripts encode proteins that are targeted toward different organelles, the pattern of subcellular localization of the RNA transcripts differentially expressed should be similar to that of proteins differentially expressed in spaceflight. To ascertain this, we compared transcripts and proteins with differential abundance in our spaceflight experiments against SUBA4, and results were subsequently fed into SUBAcon (Hooper et al., 2017) to recover more accurate proteome-wide subcellular localizations. Transcripts encoding nucleus-targeted proteins constituted the largest percentage of the transcripts upregulated (25%) and downregulated (28.5%) in spaceflight ( Figure 2A ). KEGG pathway analysis of the nucleus-targeted transcripts upregulated in spaceflight indicated that they are majorly involved in plant hormone signal transduction pathways which are tryptophan metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis, diterpenoid biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism ( Supplementary Figure 2A ). Transcripts encoding nucleus-targeted proteins downregulated in spaceflight are involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome pathway, with many being part of the ubiquitin ligase complex and the ER-associated degradation complex (ERAD) ( Supplementary Figure 2B ). Another interesting group of transcripts are those encoding proteins targeted towards extracellular matrix, being 20% of the total upregulated RNA and 11.1% of the total downregulated RNA. Upregulated transcripts encoding extracellular-matrix targeted proteins are enriched in cell wall biogenesis, cell wall macromolecule metabolic process, and flavonoid metabolic process, while the downregulated ones are uniquely enriched in pathways involved in response to salicylic acid, polysaccharide biosynthetic process, response to brassinosteroid and cell wall organization ( Figure 2B ). The metabolic pathways enriched were significantly different in the extracellular protein dataset in comparison with the RNA transcriptome ( Figure 2B ). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Subcellular localization of differentially abundant RNA and proteins in spaceflight. (A). Bar chart comparing the percentage of RNA transcripts (hashed bars) and root (dotted bars) and shoot (black bars) proteins localized in each subcellular compartment. The subcellular localizations were identified using SUBA4 and localization consensus was determined using SUBAcon. (B). GO enrichment heat map and hierarchical cluster tree of transcripts that encode extracellular matrix-targeted proteins and the proteins that are localized in the extracellular matrix. The color gradient of the heatmap indicates the significance of the genes and proteins in the enriched metabolic pathways. Labels with “Up” means upregulated in spaceflight and downregulated on Earth while labels with “Down” indicates downregulated in spaceflight and upregulated on Earth.In the root, plastid localized proteins constituted 35.5% of soluble and membrane proteins with reduced abundance in spaceflight, while they constituted 10.3% of proteins more abundant in spaceflight than on earth ( Figure 2A ). Enrichment analysis of root plastid localized proteins that were differentially abundant in spaceflight indicated that proteins involved in plastid movements, organization of plastid membranes, and light harvesting were less abundant in spaceflight than on earth, while those involved in valine biosynthetic pathways, reductive pentose-phosphate cycle, and the dark reaction of photosynthesis were more abundant in spaceflight. The valine biosynthetic pathway is intertwined with the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway, and they both inhibit the growth of shoots (Cao et al., 2019) and increase root formation. Notably, 154 membrane and 51 soluble extracellular localized proteins were abundant in spaceflight in the root and they are majorly involved in glycan degradation, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and pentose-glucuronate interconversion. This is indicative of increased restructuring of the root cell wall polysaccharides in spaceflight. The distribution of protein localization in the shoot is similar to the root, with plastid localized proteins constituting 32.4% of proteins less abundant in spaceflight, while cytosolic protein constituted 33.4% of the proteins more abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 2A ). However, enrichment analysis of shoot plastid localized proteins indicated high enrichment of proteins involved in plastid transcription and organization, chlorophyll metabolism, and photosynthesis. Contrary to the root, 83 membrane and 63 soluble extracellular proteins were more abundant in spaceflight and they are highly enriched in pathways for cellular oxidation regulation and negative regulation of peptidase activities. Extracellular proteins less abundant in spaceflight are enriched in pathways responsible for plant defense. An interesting observation as regards the comparative subcellular localization of transcriptome and root and shoot proteome in spaceflight is that most downregulated RNA in spaceflight encode proteins targeted back to the nucleus whereas most downregulated proteins in spaceflight are plastids localized. Cytosolic proteins are most upregulated in spaceflight, whereas transcripts encoding nucleus-targeted proteins are most upregulated ( Figure 2A ).3.3. Enrichment analysis of the gene ontology terms Creating a functional profile of transcriptome and proteome abundance in spaceflight elucidates various underlying biological, cellular and molecular processes affected by the harsh spaceflight environmental conditions such as microgravity, ionizing radiation and so on. Insight into the biological roles of these RNAs and proteins was acquired through enrichment analysis of the protein ontologies. A common feature in spaceflight, across the transcriptome and proteome landscapes, is the upregulation and enrichment of stress response proteins, especially those involved in response to light stimulus, radiation, oxygen, and water deprivation ( Figure 3A ). Enriched among the downregulated RNA and proteins are those involved in translation, amide biosynthetic process, mitochondrial and peroxisome fission ( Figure 3A ). A correlation plot of the expression (log2 fold change) of transcripts and the shoot and root proteins indicated very low gene expression correlation between shoot proteins and transcripts (r=−0.004) and between root proteins and transcripts (r=0.021). However, protein expression between the shoot and root is positively correlated (r=0.878) ( Figure 3B ). An overview of the gene ontology of the gene expression pattern between the transcripts and shoot and root proteins is represented by a heat map ( Figure 3C ). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Gene ontology enrichment of RNA and proteins differentially expressed in spaceflight (A). Network interaction map of RNA and proteins with a similar pattern of expression in spaceflight. Upregulated transcripts with upregulated proteins are above, while downregulated transcripts with downregulated proteins are below. The node sizes indicate the number of genes enriched in that pathway while two pathways (nodes) are connected only if they share a minimum of 20% genes. GO terms enrichment analyses were conducted in ShinyGO 0.77 (GO terms were accessed in June 2023). (B). Correlation graph of the log2 fold change of shoot and root proteins with total RNA transcripts. The correlations were plotted separately with black triangles representing the correlation of the log2 fold change of proteins in the root and the log2 fold change of the plant total RNA (root vs total RNA) with a correlation coefficient, r2=0.021, and circles representing the correlation of the log2 fold change of proteins in the shoot and the log2 fold change of the plant total RNA (shoot vs total RNA) with a correlation coefficient, r2 =−0.004. The plot of the correlation of the log2 fold change of shared proteins in the root and shoot (Root vs Shoot) is not shown on the graph. However, its correlation coefficient (r2=0.878) is displayed. (C). Heatmap of the GO enrichment of gene expression patterns in RNA, shoot, and root proteins. The corresponding GO terms are listed to the right of the heat map. The color gradients represent the Z-score calculated from the L2FC, with blue as downregulated and red as upregulated. Both row and column hierarchical clusters indicate the similarities of the categories.Membrane and soluble proteins involved in the activation of protein kinase activity, regulation of microtubule depolymerization, and cellular detoxification were abundant and notably enriched in root and shoot ( Figure 3C ). Another important observation among proteins less abundant in spaceflight is the enrichment of transport proteins, cargo sorting proteins and vesicle loading proteins ( Supplementary Table A ). Proteins involved in the negative regulation of the cytoskeleton were abundant and highly enriched in spaceflight in both organs ( Supplementary Figures 3, 4 ). It is unclear whether this was a response to spaceflight or a regulator of the response. Specific to the root, proteins involved in DNA topological change, amino acid activation, and regulation of fiber organization were enriched among proteins more abundant in spaceflight while those involved in photoinhibition, cytoskeleton organization, and reactive oxygen species metabolic process were enriched among proteins less abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 3C ). Soluble proteins involved in mitochondrial elongation and the glyoxylate cycle were highly enriched in spaceflight ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) suggesting the compensation of photosynthetic ATP production deficit by increasing metabolic fluxes through the glyoxylate cycle. Further analysis of the photosystems’ proteome supports this suggestion. In the shoot, a large proportion of the enriched proteins are involved in nucleotide metabolic processes, protein synthesis, and localization to several destinations ( Supplementary Figure 5 ).3.4. Alterations to the photosystems transcriptome and proteome in the spaceflight environment The presence of customizable discrete lighting in the BRIC LED hardware led to the enrichment of several RNA transcripts and proteins involved in the photosynthetic pathways ( Figure 4 , Supplementary Table B ). Interestingly, all the photosystem RNA transcripts differentially expressed in spaceflight were upregulated, whereas most of them became less abundant in both the shoot and root proteomes ( Figure 4 ). This is indicative of post-transcriptional regulation of the photosystem transcripts suggestive of a suppressive adaptation mechanism to reduce light harvesting ability of the photosystems. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Abundance of photosystem RNA transcripts and proteins in spaceflight. The differential abundance of photosynthetic RNA transcript (top) proteins in the root (middle) and shoot (bottom) as determined by their Log2 fold change. The orange color indicates RNA transcripts and proteins that are more abundant in spaceflight, while the blue color indicates RNA transcripts and proteins that are less abundant in spaceflight. Uncolored boxes indicate RNA transcripts and proteins that were not significantly abundant in spaceflight and on Earth. This figure was developed by the KEGG path view. Supporting data can be found in the Supplementary Table B .Common in both organs and more abundant in spaceflight than on earth are PHOTOSYSTEM II PROTEIN D1 (PSBA L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.56, 1.02), a complex that absorbs PSII photoinhibition damages and facilitates the repair of photosystem II, and PPL1 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.61, 1.6) a member of the oxygen-evolving complex. Likewise, ATP SYNTHASE EPSILON CHAIN (ATPBE, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.51, 0.51) was more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth in both organs ( Figure 4 ). The Epsilon subunit of the F-ATPase unit selectively inhibits ATP hydrolysis. This leads to a reduced yield of ATP from photosynthesis. Of the proteins involved in the binding of ferredoxin within the reaction center, only PHOTOSYSTEM, I REACTION CENTER SUBUNIT II-1 (PSAD, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.35, 1.69) was abundant in spaceflight in both organs, while the other member of the complex were less abundant in spaceflight. Less abundant in spaceflight in both organs are the α-subunit of CYTOCHROME B559 (PSBE, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−1.37, −1.81) which reduces susceptibility to high irradiance and PHOTOSYSTEM II CP43 REACTION CENTER PROTEINs (PSBC, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.52, −0.64, PSBB, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.72, −1.20) which serve as the proximal antennae for Photosystem II. Arabidopsis psbe mutants show high susceptibility to strong light damage and reduced plastoquinone pool (Giardi et al., 2013). The decreased abundance of CYTOCHROME F (PETA, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.77, −1.18) in the cytochrome b6/f complex in both organs suggests the exposure of the PSI to high electron influx from the PSII. The FERREDOXIN-NADP(+) OXIDOREDUCTASE-LIKE PROTEIN (PETH, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.2, −0.29), an FNR component of the electron transport in photosystem I and the ATP SYNTHASE subunits (ATPA, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.27, −0.24, ATPB, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.73, −0.8, ATPC1, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.49, −0.77) were also less abundant in spaceflight in both organs ( Figure 4 , Supplementary Table B ). The F-type ATPase subunit drives ATP synthesis, using proton gradient, by allowing passive flux of protons across the membrane, and their reduced abundance in spaceflight coupled with increased ATP hydrolysis inhibition suggests decreased energy production via photosynthesis in spaceflight compared to earth. Notably specific to the root and more abundant in spaceflight are PSBD (L2FCRoot=0.25) and PSBO1 (L2FCRoot=0.5) which are mediators of oxygen evolution (Antonacci et al., 2018). The CYTOCHROME B6-F COMPLEX IRON-SULFUR SUBUNIT (PET C, L2FCShoot=−0.64), a mediator of electron transfer from photosystem II to photosystem I was less abundant in spaceflight and specific to only the shoot ( Figure 4 ). PSAD, PSBA and oxygen evolution complex proteins (PSBO, PPL1 and PSBP) had a significantly higher log2-fold increase in the shoot than in the root ( Figure 4 , Supplementary Table B ), suggesting higher photosynthetic stress in the shoot than root despite equal exposure to light in the BRIC LED hardware.3.5. Spaceflight alters ionic, molecular, and vesicular transports in both organs Several signaling molecules are delivered to target sites via translocation across different cellular membranes, with most ions moving passively through gated channels and molecules via active transports (Yang and Hinner, 2015). Hence, we decided to assess how the spaceflight environment affected the intracellular transport transcriptome and proteome landscape in Arabidopsis. The RNA transcript and different plant organ proteome had profoundly distinct distributions of upregulated and downregulated intracellular transporters in spaceflight ( Figure 5 ). More ionic, molecular, and vesicular transport pathways were upregulated in spaceflight compared to the downregulated. Common to all the molecular fractions are RNA transcripts and proteins of auxin polar transporters. Likewise, RNA transcripts and proteins involved in the transport of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipids, water, ions, sucrose, and vesicles were upregulated in spaceflight ( Figure 5A ). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Spaceflight enrichment of RNA transcripts and proteins involved in cellular transport. (A). Upregulated RNA and protein in spaceflight (top), downregulated RNA and protein in spaceflight (bottom). RNA transcripts are represented by hashed bars, shoot proteins by black bars and root proteins by dotted bars. (B). Hierarchical clustering tree of enriched RNA transcripts and protein involved in auxin polar transport. The cluster tree for the upregulated auxin transporter term and downregulated auxin transporter term is bottom. Bigger dots indicate more significant p-values. The biological functional characterization was conducted in ShinyGO 0.77, with redundant and/or repeated GO-terms eliminated across the dataset. In the case of overlapping functional groups, the functionality with the highest enrichment is selected.3.5.1. Ionic transport proteins Proteins involved in ionic transport were more abundant in spaceflight across both organs ( Figure 5A , Supplementary Table A ). The abundance of proton and calcium-pump ATPases such as the H+ATPase, (AHA11, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.36, 0.99), V-TYPE PROTON PUMPS (VHAB3, VHA-A2, VHA-D, VHA-F, VHA-G2, VHA-B2 and VHA-C3) and CALCIUM-TRANSPORTING ATPASES (ACA2, ACA4, ACA8) signifies an increased effort towards maintaining cellular homeostasis in spaceflight. The calcium-transporting ATPases regulate intracellular Ca2+ levels and are essential for adaptation to stressful environments. The SODIUM/CALCIUM EXCHANGER (NCL, L2FCRoot=0.36), also involved in the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis and the FERRITINS (FER1, FER3, FER4) were abundant in spaceflight. Ferritins provide the cell with the optimal iron level while maintaining its bioavailability for physiological conditions. The abundance of ferritin in spaceflight suggests a high requirement for iron, either as a form of defense or to protect the DNA against oxidative damage as a result of the abundance of ROS. The organ specificity of some cation transporters is noteworthy ( Supplementary Table A Cation transporters such as CHLORIDE CHANNEL PROTEIN CLC-A (CLC-A, L2FCRoot=0.2), and POTASSIUM TRANSPORTER 13 (POT13, L2FCRoot=0.37) were root-specific. Cation transporters were more abundant in the root in spaceflight than in the shoot ( Supplementary Table A ). This might be indicative of more homeostatic needs in the root than shoot in microgravity. The VACOULAR IRON TRANSPORTER PROTEIN (MEB1, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.4, −0.5) was more abundant in the root but less abundant in the shoot in spaceflight. This further confirms more iron requirements by the root in spaceflight. The CASPARIN STRIP PROTEIN (L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.62, −0.71) was also less abundant in spaceflight. CASPs are thought to direct transport across the plasma membrane by forming a protein scaffold and they also play a role in plant cell wall lignification (Kolbeck et al., 2022). Eleven of the Ras-related family proteins (RABs) were abundant in spaceflight in an organ-specific manner. These small GTP binding proteins function in targeting and tethering transport vesicles to specific acceptor compartments. The RAN GTPASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN (RANGAF, L2FCShoot=−0.42) was less abundant in spaceflight, while two proteins that bind to Ran GTPase homolog (RANBP1B, RANBP1C) were abundant in spaceflight than on earth ( Supplementary Table A ).3.5.2. Vesicular transport Proteins involved in Golgi and Intra-golgi vesicular transport were more enriched on Earth than in spaceflight ( Supplementary Table A ). The majority of the VACUOLAR-SORTING RECEPTORS (VSR1, VSR2, VSR3, VSR4) with the exception of VSR7 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.4, −0.5) were less abundant in spaceflight. The abundance of Ca2+ channel proteins in spaceflight is expected to lead to an abundance of VSRs as cargo binding to VSRs is enhanced by high Ca2+ concentration (Kang and Hwang, 2014), but this was not so. The decreased abundance of CLATHRINE HEAVY CHAIN PROTEIN (CHC2, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.43, −0.41) in spaceflight suggests a decreased endocytosis and vesicle formation in both organs. SYNTAXIN 61 (SYP61, L2FCRoot=−0.33), SYNTAXIN 81 (SYP81, L2FCShoot=−0.57), SYNTAXIN 43 (SYP43, L2FCRoot=−0.57), SYNTAXIN 22 (SYP22, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.46, 1.48) and SYNTAXIN 132 (SYP132, L2FCRoot= 0.34), member of SNARE proteins, were organ-specific in their abundance in spaceflight. The NOVEL PLANT SNARE 11 (NPSN11, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.27, 1.14) was also abundant in both organs in space ( Supplementary Table A ). Synaptotagmins (SYTA L2FCRoot=0.29), a calcium sensor that regulates rapid and synchronous vesicle exocytosis for plant viral movement and a requirement for tethering the ER to the plasma membrane, was also abundant in space.3.5.3. Lipid and hormone transport RNA transcripts and proteins involved in the intracellular transportation of lipids were more enriched and abundant in spaceflight than on Earth ( Figure 5 ). GLYCOLIPID TRANSFER PROTEIN (GTP, L2FCRoot=0.32) and ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 11 (ACD11, L2FCShoot=0.32), involved in sphingolipid transport were abundant in spaceflight in both root and shoot respectively. The abundance of NON-SPECIFIC LIPID-TRANSFER PROTEINS (LTP1, LTP5, LTPG31) and PROTEIN FATTY ACID EXPORT 3 (FAX3, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.32, 0.66) in spaceflight suggests the use of long-distance systemic signaling in space and the formation of lipid polymer barriers. The PHOSPHOLIPID-TRANSPORTING ATPASE 10 (ALA10, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.69, 0.55), a lipid flippase, was abundant in spaceflight. ALA10 is involved in the desaturation process of phosphatidylcholine, a lipid abundant during phosphate starvation and in the regulation of auxin polar transport. The abundance of PATELLINs (PATL2, PATL4, PATL6), regulators of auxin-mediated PIN1 relocation, and AUXIN EFFLUX CARRIERS 3 (PIN3, L2FCRoot=0.49) in spaceflight and the decrease in abundance of the PIN4 (L2FC Root/Shoot=−0.46, −0.75), PIN7(L2FC Root/Shoot=−0.27, −0.84), AUXIN RESPONSE 4 (AXR4, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.34, −0.47), AUXIN TRANSPORTER PROTEIN1 (LAX1, L2FCShoot=−0.74), ABCB1 (L2FCShoot=−0.21) and ABCB20 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.35, −0.65) suggests an alteration in polar auxin redistribution in plants grown in spaceflight ( Figure 5B ). The MYOSINs (XIB, ATM1, XI-H, XI-K, MYA2), which are motor proteins that drive movement along the actin filaments were not significantly abundant (p<0.05) in the shoot in spaceflight but were significantly less abundant in the root. The expression of auxin transporters was organ-specific and this suggested that the distribution of auxin is altered differently in the root and shoot for adaptation to the space environment ( Supplementary Table A ).3.6. Influence of spaceflight on proteins involved in cell wall synthesis, integrity and maintenance Altered gravity has been identified to have profound effects on the architecture of plant cell walls (Kordyum and Chapman, 2017). Common to both organs and more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth are Endoglucanase 20 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.86, 1.13), involved in the degradation of cellulose to its monomeric subunit, FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINs (FLA 7, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.51, 1.43, and FLA 9, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.73, 0.53) and PLASMA MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED CATION-BINDING PROTEINs (PCAP1, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.49, 0.52 and PCAP2, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.08, 1.47) which are have been implicated in microtubule destabilization and identified as possible regulators of phosphatidylinositol phosphates membrane reformations during intracellular signaling ( Table 2 ). VILLINs (VLN2, VLN3, VLN4), proteins involved in the bundling, severing, nucleating, and capping of the actin cytoskeleton, were also more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth, in both organs ( Table 2 ). Spaceflight alters the biogenesis of microtubules and this is achieved differently in the root and shoot. Table 2. Differentially abundant proteins related to cell wall biosynthesis and maintenance.

CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB, L2FCRoot=−0.4), whose expression reduces the number of microtubules, were root-specific and less in spaceflight ( Table 2 ). β-tubulin dimers (TUBB2, TUBB4, TUBB8, TUBB9) were abundant in spaceflight in the root alone. β-tubulins are more exposed to phosphorylation than α-tubulin which are prone to detyrosination. Modification of tubulin is usually mediated by the tubulin cofactors. The UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs (RGP1, L2FCRoot=0.22 and RGP2, L2FCRoot=0.56) involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides were abundant in the root in spaceflight. Specific to the shoot are the polymers of α-tubulin, TUBA1 (L2FCShoot=−0.78) and TUBA5 (L2FCShoot=−0.3), which were less abundant in spaceflight compared to Earth ( Table 2 ).3.7. Spaceflight and the plant REDOX homeostasis Regulating the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidants and redox enzymes in plant cells is a key adaptation mechanism for plant survival. ROS are involved in plant systemic signaling, and at the same time can be a result of stress metabolism. Over 132 RNA transcripts and 241 proteins involved in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis and ROS signaling were significantly altered (p<0.05) in spaceflight ( Figure 6 , Supplementary Table C ). While the RNA transcripts included only a few of the traditionally known ROS and ROS-associated genes such as peroxidases, -redoxins, dehydrogenases, and so on, the proteome had many of them. The RNA transcripts involved in the response to ROS pathway differentially expressed in spaceflight include heat shock proteins (HSPs), transcription factors, and ubiquitin ligases ( Figure 6 ). In both organs, 18 of the 20 PEROXIDASE proteins were abundant in spaceflight, indicating a high rate of ROS generation through the reduction of peroxide. Proteins regulating isocitrate metabolism, AC01 (L2FCRoot=0.33), ACO3 (L2FCRoot=0.57), CICDH (L2FCRoot=0.54), and IDH5 (L2FCShoot=0.43) were more abundant in spaceflight than on earth. The isocitrate pathway is the branchpoint of many other metabolic pathways in plants and the abundance of the Isocitrate dehydrogenase NAD+ catalytic enzymes suggests that plants in spaceflight environments use the isocitrate pathway to supplement NADPH generation from the pentose phosphate pathway. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Redox homeostasis in spaceflight.

The color gradient represents the significance of the enrichment of the genes and proteins in the metabolic pathway indicated by the right side of the plot.SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, FSD1 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.9, 0.99), FSD3 (L2FC Shoot=0.31) and THIOREDOXIN REDUCTASE (NTRA, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.0, 193) were abundant in spaceflight and they facilitate the removal of superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner. A vacuolar phosphatase (PAP26, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.43, 0.76) involved in the recycling of inorganic phosphate from intracellular phosphate metabolite (Veljanovski et al., 2006) was more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth. Enriched in the spaceflight environment are proteins (PGD1, TKL-2, NADP-ME2, and G6PD1), recognized as major participants of the pentose-phosphate shunt pathway ( Supplementary Table C ). The pentose phosphate shunt pathway is a parallel alternative to the glycolysis pathway. Surprisingly, both RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG PROTEIN D (RBOHD, L2FCShoot=−0.67) and L-ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 3, L2FCShoot=−0.95) were less abundant in spaceflight in the shoot. The RBOHD produces ROS in response to environmental stress and plant signaling. Here, roots seem to be more impacted by oxidative stress and abundance of ROS than shoots in spaceflight ( Supplementary Table C ).4. Discussion 4.1. Arabidopsis adapts photosystems to the spaceflight environment to minimize impacts on photosynthesis This study assesses the physiological and molecular impacts of the spaceflight environment on Arabidopsis seedlings grown in NASA BRIC LED hardware using a combined transcriptomics and proteomics approach. The BRIC LED hardware, with integrated LED illumination, provides the growing seedlings with a source of light. Hence, plants growing in the BRIC LED hardware on ISS will have light cues but lack gravitational cues. This enabled us to study the effects of microgravity on plant transcriptome and organ-specific proteome, while also providing insight into how the plant root and shoot individually integrate light signaling in the absence of gravity. Evidence from this study suggests that the operations of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) were greatly impacted in spaceflight ( Figure 4 ), with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. While the net photosynthetic rate might not be affected in microgravity as it was not captured in this study, the molecular functions of the photosynthetic apparatus, as revealed by this study, were impacted. The abundance of the NusG-like proteins (PTAC12, PTAC14, PTAC3, PTAC4) in the shoot and NusG-like proteins (PTAC16, PTAC14) in the root ( Supplementary Table D ) suggests attempts at boosting the translational efficiency of chloroplast ribosomes to reduce the plant sensitivity to environmental stress in spaceflight. The abundance of D1 complex protein (PSBA) and the PPL1 in spaceflight suggests attempts to optimize the water-oxidizing reaction and repair damages to the PSII. Reduced abundance of the PSAB and PSAE isoforms of the PSI in spaceflight, signifies an increased susceptibility of the PSII to photoinhibition (Krieger-Liszkay et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2022) and a deficiency of the PSI steady state redox-level and re-oxidation. The PPL1, which was abundant in spaceflight in both organs, works to facilitate the assembly of PSII and optimize plant fitness under increased sensitivity to the BRIC LED hardware light. Suppression of the PSI electron transport subunit protein, PETH, in spaceflight, is associated with reduced efficiency of the electron transport chain and instability of the PSI. However, this reduced efficiency is compensated for by an increased abundance of chloroplast gene translations (PTACs), which helps to prevent over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool. The reduced abundance of PSII proximal antennae protein cp43 (PSBC) and the light-harvesting chlorophyll complexes (LHCB1, LHCB4, LHCB5, LHCB6) in spaceflight suggest an attempt to decrease light harvest by the photosystems, hence decrease photoinhibition, increase the oxygen-evolving capability and improve repair to PSII. Varying degrees of molecular perturbations to the plant photosystem complexes in spaceflight have earlier been reported, which further validate our findings (Stutte et al., 2005; Chen and Wang, 2016; Vandenbrink et al., 2019). However, unlike in this current study, where PSII and PSI complexes transcripts (RNA) were upregulated in spaceflight, Vandenbrink et al. (2019) reported significant downregulation of transcripts enriched in photosynthetic pathways in spaceflight compared to ground samples. They also indicated the downregulation of four RNA transcripts associated with photosynthetic electron transport (petE: plastocyanin, petF: ferredoxin, petH: ferredoxin–NADP+ reductase, petJ: cytochrome c6). These transcripts were however upregulated in spaceflight in our current study, but they were all downregulated at the proteome level in both the plant root and shoot ( Figure 4 ). These discrepancies at the transcript level may be due to the difference in Arabidopsis wildtype ecotypes and spaceflight hardware utilized in both experiments. While Vandenbrink et al. (2019) utilized the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsberg and the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) hardware, this study utilized the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 and the BRIC LED hardware. Basu et al. (2017) and Olanrewaju et al. (2023) emphasize that the choice of hardware is a significant source of variations in the results of plant spaceflight experiments transcriptomics and proteomics. Chen and Wang (2016) delineated another tangent by revealing that out of 38 photosystem-associated proteins that exhibited differential expression in spaceflight-grown rice seedlings, 34 were downregulated in spaceflight compared to Earth controls. While our findings and that of Vandenbrink et al. (2019) support the coherent perturbation of both the PSII and PS I as revealed by the transcriptome and proteome, Chen and Wang (2016) suggested from their fluorescent emission spectra studies that despite the changes to the PSII proteins in spaceflight, their activity under microgravity is not affected, in contrast with the PSI which had significantly reduced energy transfer rates, hence impaired photosynthetic activity. Of course, Chen and Wang (2016) study was carried out on Rice seedlings, not Arabidopsis and directly extrapolating the differential PS I and PSII findings to Arabidopsis might not be so efficient. However, a consensus is that the spaceflight environment leads to a reduction in the PS I and PSII complexes, which may be accompanied by reduced photosynthetic efficiency and consequent smaller plant tissues. The expression of the photosynthesis-associated proteins in the root might be due to the architecture of the BRIC LED hardware, which places the LEDs in close proximity to the roots, making them prone to direct hit by light. Interestingly, Paul et al. (2013) also reported the expression of several genes involved in light regulation in Arabidopsis roots in spaceflight transcriptomics experiments, even when the roots were not in close proximity to light. This phenomenon was also observed by Kruse et al. (2020) in their whole seedling transcriptomics study, despite that the seedlings were grown in the total absence of light cue in spaceflight. Hence, it is suggested that when gravity is absent, plant roots rely more heavily on negative phototropism for navigation, inducing light-sensing “tools” in roots in the spaceflight environment (Paul et al., 2017). The proteome landscape of the root and shoot, however, differs significantly in spaceflight, suggesting different adaptation mechanisms to the space environment, a further confirmation of Paul et al. (2013) transcriptomic study’s observation of organ-specificity in plant response to spaceflight. Vandenbrink et al. (2016) also proposed an interaction between plants’ gravity and light harvesting machinery at a genetic level, based on their observations of blue-light phototropic response in roots of Arabidopsis grown in microgravity. The upregulation of most of the photosystem and contrasting decreased abundance of corresponding proteins in spaceflight ( Figure 4 ) however, suggests that major adaptive response to spaceflight environmental stimulus might be regulated at the post-transcriptional level, even though the direct effect of the stimulus is still observed at the transcriptional level. A combined translatome-proteome study approach will be useful to elucidate this phenomenon.4.2. Intracellular trafficking and cell wall synthesis in spaceflight Plants, throughout their evolutionary history, have developed remarkable adaptations to counteract the unrelenting force of gravity (Medina et al., 2021). To withstand the gravitational force, plants have to ensure a balance between the internal turgor pressure, mediated by intracellular trafficking, and tensile resistance of both the primary and secondary cell walls. One pivotal molecular insight is the potential shift in cellulose metabolism in spaceflight, as indicated by the heightened abundance of Endoglucanase 20. Enhanced cellulose degradation might be a strategic adaptation, possibly optimizing cell wall flexibility in response to the unique stresses of a microgravity environment. This could be complemented by shifts in cellular adhesion dynamics, given the altered levels of FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINs. The implications of these shifts could range from altered tissue integrity to modifications in intercellular communication. In a comprehensive transcriptomics meta-analysis of Arabidopsis plants cultivated in spaceflight within the BRIC Petri-dish fixation unit (PDFU) hardware, Johnson et al. (2017) highlighted potential alterations in the cell wall matrix of plants in spaceflight, as revealed by the glycomics evaluation of the BRIC-16-Cyt samples. They implied that microgravity influences the biosynthesis of xylan and pectic elements, leading to variations in the composition of the cell wall matrix. Alongside this, Johnson et al. (2017) also reported the reduced abundance of xylan and pectic epitopes in spaceflight-grown plants, which resonate with our findings, highlighting the potential changes in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides in spaceflight conditions, particularly in the root. Nakashima et al. (2023) in their novel glycome profiling and immunohistochemistry of Arabidopsis in spaceflight also observed that roots from spaceflight Arabidopsis seedlings displayed a generally increased labeling intensity when targeted with xyloglucan monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) compared to ground controls. They concluded that the heightened fluorescence intensity post-labeling with xyloglucan mAbs might result from changes in polysaccharide biosynthesis and secretion due to microgravity conditions. Wakabayashi et al. (2020) in their studies on Rice seedling cell wall under spaceflight conditions indicated that microgravity reduces the 1,3:1,4-β-glucan content in rice shoot cell walls, implicating an increase in the expression of an endo-1,3:1,4-β-glucanase gene. This reduction might serve to keep the cell wall more flexible under microgravity conditions. This observation is in harmony with our data, revealing potential changes in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight environments. Interestingly, while these studies reported that glucan metabolism is impacted, the spaceflight environment (microgravity) seems to exert minimal influence on the metabolism of arabinoxylans. This differentiation in response indicates a level of specificity in how plants adjust their cell wall components in response to altered gravity. In the absence of gravity, seedlings have to default to secondary signals such as other environmental impulses. This affects internal homeostasis, inter- and intra-cellular transports, and cell wall composition. Our results identified intracellular Ca2+ transport as a major player in adaptation to microgravity in both root and shoot. This is characterized by the increased abundance of the vacuolar proton ATPases and calcium-transporting ATPases. The vacuolar ATPases, contributing to the cytosolic pH homeostasis, form electrochemical proton gradients and drive active transport into cell organelles and they are important targets of phosphorylation and redox modification. The root-specific abundance of the cation transporters suggests that the homeostatic needs of the root differ from that of the shoot in spaceflight. The altered abundance of small GTPases such as Ran, Rab, and Ras, between spaceflight and Earth suggests a functional dysregulation of vesicle trafficking in spaceflight. The spaceflight environment alters molecular switches between the membrane-bound active GTP and cytosolic inactive GDP which tremendously affects signal transduction. Molecular mechanisms driving polar auxin distribution were affected and organ-specific, with the altered abundance of auxin transporters in spaceflight and on Earth. However, auxin transport and response appear to be more pronounced on Earth than in microgravity. Results from this study also suggest a decreased stability of the cellulose cell wall in spaceflight, due to the abundance of cellulose-degrading proteins and less abundance of cellulose synthase ( Table 2 ). The spaceflight environment led to the decreased formation and increased destabilization of the microtubules which suggests that seedlings seem to fall back on the actin skeleton for support. Interactions between PIP2 which is abundant in space, with VILLINs which were also abundant in space inhibit the capping and severing actions of actin but rather increase actin binding at the headpiece region. This suggests that actin cross-nucleation and cross-linking is an adaptation mechanism for plants in space. An in-depth study into vesicle and cargo sorting under microgravity will give more insight into how plants adapt their intracellular trafficking and cell wall depositions to the spaceflight environment.4.3. Spaceflight significantly affects plant translation machinery in an organ-specific pattern The varied abundance of over 150 ribosomal subunit proteins, spliceosomes and proteasomes in spaceflight and across both organs suggest major alterations to plant transcriptional and translation machinery as an adaptation mechanism to the spaceflight environment ( Supplementary Tables E, F ). The decreased abundance of various mRNA slicing factors (ATO, CUV, SC35, SCL30A, U2AF65A, U2AF65B, DEAH3) in the shoot in spaceflight suggests less mRNA splicing in the shoot compared to the root, which might lead to the abundance of non-functional proteins in the shoot and increased need for proteasome activities. Combining transcript data with this proteome data will give more insight into this. The abundance of HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN families (HS60, HSP70, HSP90) in both organs suggests an increased control of protein homeostasis in space characterized by folding of nascent polypeptides released from the ribosome, sorting of proteins to cell organelles and providing a link to the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. The relative abundance of 26S proteasomes involved in the degradation of misfolded and orphaned proteins suggests that the spaceflight environment led to errors in protein translation, hence the need to increase the efficiency of the proteasome unit.4.4. Combating oxidative stress while maintaining ROS signaling in spaceflight Seedlings in spaceflight are faced with the need to maintain a balance between the abundance of ROS for systemic stress signaling and their damaging effects. Our results suggest dedicated efforts to the removal of superoxide radicals by the abundance of several peroxides, thioredoxin, ferritin, and superoxide dismutase in spaceflight. We infer that plants in spaceflight utilize a shunt pathway, which is a parallel alternative to the glycolytic pathway, to complement the NADPH production from the pentose-phosphate pathway. The pentose-phosphate shunt pathway is driven by NADPH demands in different tissues (Aziz and Mohiuddin, 2022), and in this extremity, plants in spaceflight recycle inorganic phosphate from intracellular phosphate metabolites in the vacuole, mediated by PAP26 to meet the NADPH demands. This suggests that the metabolic energy requirement for plants in space is higher than on Earth. The abundance of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and several glutathione dehydrogenases suggests the involvement of the S-nitrosation reaction in cellular homeostasis in spaceflight. A common feature of the ALDHs is the susceptibility of their catalytic cysteine residue to GSNO-mediated S-nitrosation (Stiti et al., 2020), which has been suggested as a central gravitropism signaling event (Kruse and Wyatt, 2022). While this study substantiates that the BRIC LED hardware supports Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight, it is important to note that the BRIC hardware, unlike some newly developed advanced spaceflight hardware such as the Advance Plant Habitat (APH), is a closed system, hence no gas exchange between the plant and the external environment. This is a major limitation for the hardware, as this promotes the buildup of gases such as ethylene, oxygen and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Klymchuk et al., 2003). Despite being an important hormone to plant, elevated ethylene level had been identified to cause anomalous Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight (Stankovic, 2018) and sterility in male wheat plants grown in spaceflight (Campbell et al., 2001). Beyond ethylene, the accumulation of oxygen and other VOCs can potentially reach toxic levels in the BRIC LED hardware. This is a substantial source of stress as indicated by Basu et al. (2017). Drawing parallels with Earth, closed environments like terrariums might encounter similar challenges with gas accumulation. However, there’s a critical difference. On Earth, natural processes and microbial interactions often intervene to balance out the system over time. But in the unique microgravity setting of space, these natural balancing acts might not function as they do here, thereby amplifying the challenges of a closed system, as we consider plants for bio-regenerative life support in long-term spaceflight missions.4.5. Non-correlated transcriptome and proteome: indicative of post-transcriptional regulation in spaceflight? Spaceflight environmental conditions pose unique challenges to plants, leading to significant alterations in gene expression and protein synthesis. Our analysis of Arabidopsis plants grown in space reveals that the expression of RNA transcripts did not correspond to their translation to shoot and root proteins. The observed non-correlation between transcriptome and proteome data from Arabidopsis plants grown in spaceflight may indeed suggest a prevalent post-transcriptional regulation (Wang et al., 2022). Transcript-protein discordance can be attributed to multiple factors. One such factor is the differential extraction protocols and data processing for RNA and protein, which can introduce variation in the extracted quantities (Liu et al., 2016). Furthermore, due to the unique environmental stressors of spaceflight, the mechanisms to arrest translation could be compromised, resulting in skewed protein synthesis rates. Moreover, the phenomenon of alternative splicing, often upregulated under stress conditions, can result in multiple protein isoforms from a single transcript, further complicating the correlation. Another source of discordance to note is that the RNA transcriptome might be a reflection of the plant’s immediate response to stress, while the proteome represents a more stabilized, adaptive response. These unique constraints of spaceflight can thus evoke distinct reactions at plants’ transcriptome and proteome levels, leading to non-correlated outcomes. Hence, attributing the non-correlation of the transcriptome and proteome only to alternative splicing will be a bias. This study, by combining transcriptomics and proteomics, provided insight into plants’ adaptive responses to the spaceflight environment at multiple molecular levels. While we did not directly measure photosynthetic net production, our findings indicate a series of modifications to photosystems II and I aimed at adapting to the space environment, potentially decreasing the plant’s sensitivity to light intensity and enhancing its oxygen-evolving capacity. Concurrently, we observed evidence for an increased metabolic energy requirement in spaceflight, with plants seemingly engaging alternate energy generation pathways to complement photosynthetic production. Furthermore, our findings indicate significant impacts on cellular trafficking and potential compromises to cell wall integrity, suggesting an adaptation in structural support provided by actin filament cross-linking and cross-nucleation. This research not only serves as a comprehensive study of plant response in spaceflight but also holds profound implications for terrestrial agriculture, providing valuable insights for developing crop varieties resilient to environmental stressors on Earth, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and salinity. This study also contributes to the broader goal of space agriculture – a key component of long-duration space missions and off-Earth colonization. While centered around the model plant Arabidopsis, our findings could provide the foundation for developing crop varieties suitable for growth in extraterrestrial environments, supporting food production for future missions to Mars and the Moon. Thus, the findings of our research, while intrinsically fascinating, also bear practical implications for the future of both terrestrial and space agriculture. As we continue to explore the final frontier, understanding how life – in this case, plant life – adapts and thrives is crucial for the success of our extraterrestrial endeavors and the sustainable development of our agriculture on Earth.Data availability statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

KEYWORDS: Aspergillus niger, International Space Station, phylogenetic analysis, proteomicsABSTRACT The initial characterization of the Aspergillus niger isolate JSC-093350089, collected from U.S. segment surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS), is reported, along with a comparison to the extensively studied strain ATCC 1015. Whole-genome sequencing of the ISS isolate enabled its phylogenetic placement within the A. niger/welwitschiae/lacticoffeatus clade and revealed that the genome of JSC-093350089 is within the observed genetic variance of other sequenced A. niger strains. The ISS isolate exhibited an increased rate of growth and pigment distribution compared to a terrestrial strain. Analysis of the isolate’s proteome revealed significant differences in the molecular phenotype of JSC-093350089, including increased abundance of proteins involved in the A. niger starvation response, oxidative stress resistance, cell wall modulation, and nutrient acquisition. Together, these data reveal the existence of a distinct strain of A. niger on board the ISS and provide insight into the characteristics of melanized fungal species inhabiting spacecraft environments. IMPORTANCE A thorough understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the various stimuli encountered during spaceflight presents many economic benefits and is imperative for the health of crew. As A. niger is a predominant ISS isolate frequently detected in built environments, studies of A. niger strains inhabiting closed systems may reveal information fundamental to the success of long-duration space missions. This investigation provides valuable insights into the adaptive mechanisms of fungi in extreme environments as well as countermeasures to eradicate unfavorable microbes. Further, it enhances understanding of host-microbe interactions in closed systems, which can help NASA’s Human Research Program maintain a habitat healthy for crew during long-term manned space missions.INTRODUCTION Throughout the history of human space exploration, filamentous fungi have traveled with us and are omnipresent on spacecraft (1–3). Microorganisms have been reported to cause biodegradation of structural spacecraft components, resulting in decreased integrity of spacecraft hardware (2). Microbial infections also constitute a major health risk for astronauts, especially in closed environments where the combined stresses of sleep disruption, microgravity, and high levels of radiation may further compromise the human immune system (2, 4). Studies have suggested that microbial virulence and antimicrobial resistance increase in response to spacecraft environments (5–7). Other reports have associated the abundance of filamentous fungus in indoor environments with allergies and invasive infections (8, 9). Additionally, fungi produce a myriad of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs) in response to environmental stressors, and while many SMs have diverse therapeutic and industrial applications, others are toxins and can have detrimental effects on human health (10). As we set our exploration sights beyond low-Earth orbit, a thorough understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the various stimuli encountered during spaceflight is critical to the success of long-term space travel. Microorganisms inhabiting the International Space Station (ISS) are exposed to microgravity and have increased exposure to high-energy radiation as a result of being outside Earth’s protective atmosphere (11). In general, it is thought that microgravity alters biological processes by initially altering the physical forces acting on the cell and its environment. This results in decreased transfer of extracellular nutrients and metabolic by-products, causing the cell to be exposed to a completely different chemical environment (11). The inside cabin of the ISS is exposed to a complex radiation environment (12), at levels that are not fungicidal (13), permitting fungi to thrive. Radiation primarily interacts with biological systems through the ionization and excitation of electrons in molecules, and its strong mutagenic properties result in an increased rate of biological evolution (14). Further, radiation can have many harmful effects on biological systems, which results in the development of adaptive responses. Fungi inhabiting spacecraft are also forced to acclimate to reduced nutrient availability, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) routinely performs stringent microbial monitoring and remediation on the ISS (15). Aspergillus niger was reported to be the predominant species isolated in one ISS microbial monitoring study (15), which is consistent with its frequent detection in built environments (16). A. niger is a melanized fungal species that is ubiquitous in nature and commonly used in biotechnology industries as a production host for citric acid and enzymes (17). Despite the recurring detection of A. niger in spacecraft environments, investigations into its genetic alteration and gene expression modulation under ISS conditions have not been carried out. Although A. niger is less pathogenic to humans than other Aspergillus species, such as A. fumigatus and A. flavus (17), it has been associated with ear infections and can cause invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients (18). This enhances the need for studies to understand how A. niger responds and adapts to the environment of the ISS, where microgravity might play a role in compromising the human immune system (2, 4). Additionally, melanized fungi are highly resistant to ionizing radiation and respond to radiation with enhanced growth and upregulation of many proteins (19, 20), some of which may provide important insight into the adaptive evolutionary mechanism of melanized fungal species. The objective of this study was to investigate a strain of A. niger isolated from surfaces of the ISS, with the aim to characterize its molecular phenotype. Although it has been well established that fungi are ubiquitous on spacecraft (1–3, 15), very few studies have been conducted to characterize fungi isolated from the ISS (21). Given that melanin production in fungi is considered an evolution-derived trait to confer radiation resistance (19, 22), the present study of a melanized fungus that has inhabited the ISS may reveal important insights into the key traits necessary to withstand such environments. Our work investigated differences of the ISS A. niger isolate from Earth isolates to better understand the characteristics of strains isolated from the space station built environment. Due to the significance of secondary metabolic processes in filamentous fungi (23), A. niger ATCC 1015 was used as a terrestrial reference strain for physiologic and proteomic analyses because its SM profile has been thoroughly characterized (24), and we aim to build on this work by investigating SM production in JSC-093350089.RESULTS Identification of A. niger sampled from the ISS. Sampling of surfaces on the ISS during microbial monitoring surveys resulted in the isolation of numerous bacterial and fungal strains (15). A strain of A. niger, JSC-093350089, identified by morphological characteristics and verified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing, was used for this study. This strain was isolated by swabbing surface materials on the U.S. segment of the ISS. Due to the nature of this sampling method, it is impossible to know the exact duration of time that this strain was on the ISS. The 36.08-Mb genome sequence of JSC-093350089 was generated using whole-genome paired-end sequencing (WGS), which was further improved to high-quality assemblies of 223 scaffolds possessing 12,532 coding sequences and 287 tRNAs. The JSC-093350089 genome was similar in size to other A. niger genomes, which typically range from 34.0 to 36.5 Mb (25–27). To further verify the identity of JSC-093350089 and place it into the larger context of the A. niger/welwitschiae/lacticoffeatus clade, phylogeny was assessed using maximum likelihood (Fig. 1). Of the A. niger strains surveyed, the ISS isolate displayed the closest phylogenetic relationship to A. niger (phoenicis). Compared to ATCC 1015, an industrial strain used for citric acid production (25), and CBS 513.88, an ancestor of the A. niger strains used industrially for enzyme production (27), it differed by 37,548 and 39,433 variants, respectively.

The basic physiological phenotype of JSC-093350089 was investigated on glucose minimal medium (GMM) agar plates. Visual characterization of centrally inoculated GMM plates revealed differences in pigment distribution and colony diameter after 7 days of growth (Fig. 2A). JSC-093350089 colony size appeared larger, and pigment had spread to the periphery of the colony in a shorter time than for ATCC 1015. Assessment of radial growth rates revealed that the ISS strain grew at a significantly higher rate than ATCC 1015 after 3 days of growth (Fig. 2B). FIG 2.

Statistical analyses were performed by multiple t tests, corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Sidak method. **, P value = 0.0021 to 0.0002; **** P value < 0.0001.Overview of proteome analysis. To investigate the differences in the proteomes of JSC-093350089 and ATCC 1015, total protein was extracted from each strain and subjected to tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. All MS data were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer with the Sequest-HT search engine against the A. niger CBS 513.88 protein database (). The CBS 513.88 protein database was used because it has been extensively annotated and enabled subsequent functional analysis using the AspGD Gene Ontology (GO) Slim Mapper tool. The abundance ratios for all proteins were normalized to ATCC 1015, which resulted in the identification of 218 proteins with increased abundance and 109 proteins with decreased abundance (fold change [FC] >|2|, P < 0.05), in JSC-093350089, relative to ATCC 1015 (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Distribution of AspGD GO Slim terms among differentially expressed proteins is displayed in Fig. 3. Many proteins that exhibited increased abundance in JSC-093350089 were involved with carbohydrate metabolic processes (10.1% of all upregulated proteins), response to stress (9.6%), organelle organization (9.6%), and transport (8.7%). Proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, protein folding, secondary metabolic processes, and transcription were associated with only increased protein abundance in JSC-093350089, while proteins involved in cellular homeostasis were associated with only decreased protein abundance in JSC-093350089. GO Slim term enrichment analysis was conducted using FungiDB (28), which identified significantly overrepresented proteins that exhibited increased abundance in the proteome of JSC-093350089 (Table S2). Significantly overrepresented GO Slim terms included carbohydrate metabolic processes (4.7% of background genes with this term), cellular component assembly (5.3%), catabolic processes (4.1%), protein complex assembly (6.4%), and response to stress (3.2%).

The proteome of JSC-093350089 revealed differential levels of cell wall modulation proteins (Table 1). Conidia of A. niger possess a relatively thick cell wall made of a network of carbohydrates, including β-glucans, chitin, α-glucans, galactomannan, and galactosaminogalactan, with an outer cell wall layer consisting of complex melanin pigments (29). The polyketide synthase AlbA (An09g05730), which is required for the production of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin (DHN-melanin) in A. niger (24), was over 2-fold more enriched in JSC-093350089 than in ATCC 1015. The protein abundance of hydrophobin Hyp1 (An07g03340) was nearly 3-fold higher than in ATCC 1015. RodA, the homologue of Hyp1 in A. nidulans, has been reported to play a role in biofilm formation and efficient deconstruction of cell wall polysaccharides (30). Its homologue in A. fumigatus was shown to enhance fungal virulence by masking dectin-1- and dectin-2-mediated recognition of conidia in vivo (31). TABLE 1.

Differential expression was observed for a number of genes encoding glycoside hydrolases, which were identified using the CAZy database (http://www.cazy.org/) (32). The starvation-induced cellobiohydrolase CbhB (An01g11660), which is regulated by XlnR (33), exhibited levels nearly 3-fold higher in the proteome of JSC-093350089 than in ATCC 1015 (34). XlnR is a transcriptional activator that regulates xylanolytic, endoglucanase, and cellobiohydrolase gene expression in A. niger (33, 35). Increased protein abundance was observed for β-d-xylosidase XlnD (An01g09960), which is also regulated by XlnR (35). Decreased protein abundance was observed for XlnR-regulated β-galactosidase LacA (An01g12150), which is exclusively expressed on xyloglucan-derived substrates (36). Similarly, XlnR-regulated endoglucanase EglC (An07g08950), which exhibits its greatest activity toward xyloglucan, also displayed decreased protein abundance (37). Other starvation-induced cell wall degradation glycoside hydrolases enriched in JSC-093350089 included α-1,3-glucanase AgnB (An07g08640) and β-glucanase Scw4 (An06g01530). Differential abundance of glycoside hydrolases involved in starch utilization was also observed. Extracellular acid α-amylase AamA (An11g03340), which plays a role in starch degradation and is regulated by starch degradation regulator AmyR (38), was present in JSC-093350089 at levels 4-fold higher than that in ATCC 1015. Four of the five enzymes in the family of GH92, which consists of mannosidases, displayed increased abundance in the proteome of JSC-093350089. These GH92 proteins included An08g08370, An13g01260, An14g04240, and An16g02910.Differential abundance of stress response proteins. Our study also revealed differential abundance of proteins involved in the stress response of A. niger (Table 2). Heat shock proteins, including DnaK-type molecular chaperone Ssb2 (An16g09260) and An06g01610, were present in JSC-093350089 at levels 2-fold and 5-fold higher than that of ATCC 1015, respectively. An06g01610 is very similar to late embryogenesis abundant (LEA)-like Hsp12 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has been reported to stabilize the plasma membrane (39). Increased protein abundance was observed for the serine/threonine protein kinase Srk1 (An07g07970) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase SakA (An08g05850), which have been reported to mediate cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial function in response to oxidative stress (40). Other proteins that exhibited higher levels in JSC-093350089 included the oxidative stress protein Svf1 (An18g02900) and An02g07350, which encodes a protein homologous to group 3 LEA proteins responsible for mitigating stress-induced damage, such as protecting seeds from drought (41, 42). The catalase An12g10720 was present at levels 13-fold higher than that of ATCC 1015. Increased abundance was also observed for the stress response nuclear envelope protein Ish1, whose expression has been reported to increase in response to glucose starvation and osmotic stress (43).

DISCUSSION In the current study, the molecular phenotype of a strain of A. niger isolated from the ISS was characterized. Despite its frequent detection in built environments, this is the first investigation into the “omic” differences of an ISS A. niger isolate from an Earth strain. As the frequency and duration of manned space missions increase, investigations into how fungi respond and adapt to various stimuli encountered during spaceflight are imperative for the health of crew and present many economic benefits. Further, such studies provide insight into the adaptive evolutionary mechanism of melanized fungal species and the biological alterations of microbes isolated from extreme spaceflight environments. The genome of JSC-093350089 was within the genetic variation of other A. niger strains, suggesting that its ability to survive and proliferate in a spacecraft environment is not contingent on enhanced genetic variance. This finding is consistent with a previous report on the genetic variance of ISS Aspergillus isolates (21). To further understand the effect of microgravity and enhanced irradiation on fungal genomics, future studies should investigate the same strain grown under both space and ground conditions to quantify and identify any mutations that may result from life on the ISS. Additional sequencing of terrestrial A. niger strains will also be important to better identify the donor population of the strain and further isolate the sequence variation that is specific to ISS-derived strains. One characteristic of the ISS isolate was increased protein abundance of AlbA, a key biosynthesis enzyme involved in the production of DHN-melanin in A. niger. While A. niger historically has black conidia due to its high melanin content, the A. niger ΔalbA mutant was reported to display a white or colorless conidial phenotype (24). This is consistent with reports that fungi isolated from high-radiation environments exhibit increased melanin production. One study found that A. niger strains occupying the south-facing slope of the “Evolution Canyon” in Israel, which receives 200% to 800% higher solar radiation than the north-facing slope, produced three times more melanin than did strains isolated from the north-facing slope (44). It is reasonable to presume that increased melanin production is a key adaptive response to the enhanced irradiation environment of the ISS, as there is considerable evidence that melanized fungi are highly resistant to ionizing radiation under experimental conditions (19, 45). In fact, it has been reported that exposure of melanin to ionizing radiation alters its electronic properties, and melanized fungal cells exhibit increased growth rates following exposure to ionizing radiation (46). Interestingly, the ISS isolate exhibited a higher growth rate than the terrestrial strain, which is consistent with previous reports of enhanced growth in melanized fungi following radiation exposure and Aspergillus and Penicillium species recovered from the ISS and Mir space stations (19, 21, 46, 47). Although this finding cannot be definitively attributed to the isolation environment, it is conceivable that rapid growth may confer a selective advantage in environments operating under strict microbial monitoring procedures. The reported increase in colony pigmentation distribution may point to enhanced melanin production in the ISS isolate, as the AlbA protein was 2-fold more enriched than in the terrestrial strain. However, the ability to rapidly spread pigment to the periphery of the colony may offer additional modes of protection from high levels of radiation present in spacecraft. The ISS isolate displayed general hallmarks of carbon starvation. During starvation, A. niger produces a myriad of glycoside hydrolases that facilitate the release of nutrients from biopolymers and the recycling of cell wall components to generate energy and building blocks that can be used for maintenance and conidiogenesis (48, 49). The observed enrichment of starvation-induced nutrient acquisition enzymes may be the result of adaptation to the low-nutrient environment that exists as a result of stringent microbial monitoring and remediation by NASA (15). The same may also be true for the increased abundance of the glycoside hydrolase AamA. AamA is highly upregulated in growing hyphae at the periphery of mycelium (50), and following secretion from exploring hyphae, AamA degrades starch into small molecules that can be taken up by the fungus to serve as nutrients. The significant enrichment of AamA suggests that JSC-093350089 can utilize starch encountered during colonization more efficiently than ATCC 1015, which may have conferred a selective advantage in the low-nutrient spacecraft environment. During spaceflight, ionizing radiation can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the hydrolysis of intracellular water, which can result in oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cell components (51). Accordingly, catalase was among the highest-upregulated proteins in the ISS isolate, which degrade H2O2 and therefore play a major role in curtailing oxidative stress (52, 53). This is consistent with previous reports that spaceflight induces the expression of oxidative stress resistance genes in microbes, animals, and astronauts (20, 54–59), and increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation has been observed in S. cerevisiae strains lacking cytosolic catalase (60, 61). Similarly, increased abundance was also observed for kinases that mediate key biological processes in response to oxidative stress (40). The high levels of oxidative stress response proteins, as found in this study, are consistent with the observed response of the melanized yeast Wangiella dermatitidis following exposure to ionizing radiation (20). On the other hand, increased resistance to oxidative stress may be a response to microgravity, as low-shear modeled microgravity has induced such a response in bacteria (62). This study has revealed the existence of a distinct strain of A. niger on board the ISS that exhibited differential growth and conidiation patterns compared to a terrestrial strain. Proteomic analysis revealed significant differences in the phenotype of JSC-093350089 that included enrichment of proteins involved in the A. niger starvation response, oxidative stress resistance, cell wall modulation, and nutrient acquisition. Given the ubiquity of A. niger in nature along with its genetic diversity among sequenced strains (25, 26), it is not surprising that JSC-093350089 exhibited a distinct molecular phenotype, and more studies will reveal if the observed phenotype is widespread for other A. niger strains isolated from the ISS. Since most of the microgravity-induced response studies were carried out utilizing opportunistic pathogens of bacteria and yeast, the “omics” characterization of ISS A. niger, a saprophyte, which exhibited higher melanin content than its Earth counterparts, could be a model to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in microbial adaptation to the ISS environment. Developing countermeasures to eradicate problematic microorganisms that adapt to unfavorable conditions would help NASA’s Human Research Program in planning for long-duration manned missions. Additionally, such analyses will further our understanding of the molecular pathways that define host-microbe interactions, thus enabling development of suitable cleaning strategies to maintain the health of habitat and coliving crew for future missions.MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation and identification of the ISS A. niger isolate. Surface samples were collected from the U.S. segment of the ISS using the Surface Sampling kit (SSK) (NASA, 2011). Microbes were removed from surfaces using a swab and sterile saline solution (0.85% sodium chloride) and were transported to Earth for analyses. Materials retrieved from the swabs were subsequently inoculated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with chloramphenicol. The PDA plates were incubated at ambient cabin temperature (28° to 37°C) for 5 days. The fungal colonies that exhibited growth were further purified and stored at −80°C in sterile glycerol stock until further analyses. When required, fungal isolates were revived on PDA medium, and DNA from pure cultures was extracted (UltraPure DNA kit [Mo Bio, Carlsbad, CA]). An approximately 600-bp region consisting of ITS 1, 5.8S, and ITS 2 of the isolated fungal DNA was PCR amplified, using primers ITS1F (5′ TTG GTC ATT TAG AGG AAG TAA 3′) and Tw13 (5′ GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG 3′) (63) and following the established protocol (64). The UNITE database was used to determine the closest similarity to ITS sequences of fungal type strains (65). The identity of the ISS isolate was subsequently confirmed by WGS.Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation. Extracted DNA was sent to the Macrogen clinical laboratory (Macrogen Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) for WGS. Library preparation was carried out using the Illumina Nextera kit (random fragmentation, adapter ligation, and cluster generation) and quantified with Quant-iT double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) high-sensitivity assays. Generated libraries were sequenced with 100-bp paired-end sequencing protocols on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Raw data images were produced utilizing HCS (HiSeq Control Software v2.2.38) for system control, and base calling (BCL) was done through an integrated primary analysis using Real Time Analysis software v1.18.61.0. The BCL binary was converted into FASTQ utilizing Illumina package bcl2fastq (v1.8.4). The NGS QC Toolkit version 2.3 (66) was used to filter the data for high-quality vector- and adapter-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for high quality, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20), and 22,769,466 vector filter reads were obtained after the quality check. High-quality vector-filtered reads were used for de novo assembly with the MaSuRCA genome assembler (k-mer size, 70) (67). The final assembly consisted of 223 scaffolds with a total size of 36,079,011 bp (∼100×). The N50 scaffold length was 543,773 kb, and the largest scaffold was 1,390.254 kb. There was no random “N” joining of the contigs to maintain high assembly quality. Quality check of the final assembly was performed using the quality assessment tool for genome assemblies (QUAST) (68). The number of N’s detected was less than 12 per 100 kb, which represents very good assembly. Genome annotation was performed with funannotate (69) (https://github.com/nextgenusfs/funannotate; v1.3.0-beta), which utilizes a combination of ab initio gene prediction tools (70, 71) and experimental evidence including proteins and transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing) and a consensus gene calling with EvidenceModeler (72).Phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of A. niger strains was performed by identifying conserved protein coding genes in available A. niger genomes and close relatives. These data were obtained by downloading public sequence data from  and the Department of Energy’s Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Mycocosm. The assemblies for strains A1, ATCC 10864, An76, FDAARGOS 311, FGSC A1279, H915-1, L2, and SH-2 were downloaded from the  Assembly Archive. The strains FDAARGOS 311 and An76 already had deposited annotations and were downloaded directly. For the remaining strains, gene prediction with Augustus (v 3.2.2) (70) used the pretrained model ‘aspergillus_niger_jsc_093350089’ generated from the genome annotation procedure. This parameter set is deposited in https://github.com/hyphaltip/fungi-gene-prediction-params. Additional strains with annotation from JGI were downloaded (ATCC 1015, DSM 1, CBS 513.88, and NRRL 3) along with related species (A. niger van Tieghem ATCC 13496, A. welwitschiae CBS 139.54b, A. phoenicis, A. lacticoffeatus CBS 101883, and A. brasiliensis CBS 101740). Coding sequences were obtained, translated into proteins, and searched for a conserved set of 71 protein coding gene markers, “AFTOL_70,” as part of the 1000 Fungal Genomes project (https://github.com/1KFG/Phylogenomics_HMMs). These markers were searched using PHYling (https://github.com/stajichlab/PHYling_unified), which first searches for conserved markers using HMMsearch followed by extraction of best hits and concatenated alignment of all the orthologous matches. A back-translated alignment of coding sequences was produced from the input proteins in order to resolve the closely related strains in this data set. A phylogenetic tree was inferred from the coding sequence tree using IQTREE (v1.6.3) first by identifying a partition scheme with -m TESTMERGE -st CODON parameters followed by a tree inference using the options -st CODON -bb 1000 -spp Partition.txt to infer the tree and obtain branch support with ultrafast bootstrapping on the reduced partition parameters under a codon model in IQTREE (73–75). To identify the number of single nucleotide variations occurring between JSC-093350089 and both ATCC 1015 and CBS 513.88, variants were called using the Harvest suite’s Parsnp tool (76).Growth conditions. JSC-093350089 and ATCC 1015 were cultivated on 10-cm petri dishes containing 25-ml glucose minimal medium (GMM) agar plates (6 g/liter NaNO3, 0.52 g/liter KCl, 0.52 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 1.52 g/liter KH2PO4, 10 g/liter d-glucose, 15 g/liter agar supplemented with 1 ml/liter of Hutner’s trace elements) with a cellophane membrane on top, on which the fungus was grown. Unless otherwise specified, 1 × 107 conidia per petri dish (D = 10 cm) were inoculated into each medium and incubated at 30°C for 5 days.Physiological analysis. Growth rates were assessed by centrally inoculating 1 × 104 conidia on GMM plates in replicates of 5 and measuring radial growth at the same time each day. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple t tests and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Sidak method. Photos depicting morphological differences were taken after 7 days.Protein extraction. Mycelia from GMM agar plates were collected and stored at −80°C prior to protein extraction. For protein extraction, the lysis buffer consisted of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1× Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (100×), with the final concentration of each component being 1 mM AEBSF [4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride], 800 nM aprotinin, 50 μM bestatin, 15 μM E64, 20 μM leupeptin, and 10 μM pepstatin A (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and 200 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Mycelia were homogenized directly using Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin, Rockville, MD) in which each sample was processed inside a 2-ml cryotube with 0.5-mm glass beads three times (at 4°C and 6,500 rpm for 1 min., repeated 3 times with 15-s pauses in between). The lysed fungi were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured by the Bradford assay with albumin for the standard curve (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA).Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling. Two hundred micrograms of proteins from each sample was precipitated in 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) at 4°C. Protein pellets were obtained by centrifugation (17,000 × g), washed with ice-cold acetone, and resuspended in 25 µl TEAB (50 mM final concentration) and 25 µl 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) (50% final concentration). Proteins were reduced by adding 1 µl of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP; 500 mM) followed by incubation for 1 h at 37°C (10 mM final TCEP concentration). Proteins were alkylated in the presence of iodoacetamide (IAA; 30 mM) in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. A 2.5-µg-per-sample quantity of mass-spectrometry-grade trypsin-LysC (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to digest the peptides overnight at 37°C. The digested peptides were quantified using the Pierce quantitative colorimetric peptide assay (Thermo Scientific). Forty micrograms of peptides from each specific sample was labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMTsixplex isobaric mass tagging kit (ATCC 1015-GMM with TMT6-128, and JSC-GMM with TMT6-129) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The TMT6-130 and -131 labels were used as a reference that contained an equal amount of the peptides from each of the four samples. All labeled-peptide mixtures were combined into a single tube, mixed, and fractionated using the Thermo Scientific Pierce high-pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit. Fractions were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and resuspended in 1% formic acid prior to LC-tandem MS (MS/MS) analysis.LC-MS/MS analysis. The samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with an Easy-nLC 1000 liquid chromatograph, a 75-μm by 2-cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 trapping column, a 75-μm by 25-cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column, and an Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Scientific). The column temperature was maintained at 45°C, and the peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nl/min over a 110-min gradient, from 3 to 30% solvent B (100 min), 30 to 50% solvent B (3 min), 50 to 90% solvent B (2 min), and 90% solvent B (2 min). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The full MS survey scan (m/z 400 to 1,500) was acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000 and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2 × 105. The maximum injection time for MS scans was 50 ms. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected with charge states 2 to 7, a ±10-ppm mass window, and 70-s dynamic exclusion. The MS2 scan (m/z 400 to 2,000) was performed using the linear ion trap with the collision-induced dissociation (CID) collision energy set to 35%. The ion trap scan rate was set to “rapid,” with an AGC target of 4 × 103 and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. Ten fragment ions from each MS2 experiment were subsequently selected for an MS3 experiment. The MS3 scan (m/z 100 to 500) was performed to generate the TMT reporter ions in the linear ion trap using heated capillary dissociation (HCD) at a collision energy setting of 55%, a rapid scan rate and an AGC target of 5 × 103, and a maximum injection time of 250 ms.Proteome data analysis. All MS spectra were searched using the Proteome Discoverer (version 2.1.0.81; Thermo Scientific) with the Sequest-HT searching engines against an Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88 database containing 10,549 sequences (). The searches were performed with the following parameters: 5-ppm tolerance for precursor ion masses and 0.6-Da tolerance for fragment ion masses. The static modification settings included carbamidomethyl of cysteine residues and dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine, TMTsixplex modification of lysine ε-amino groups and peptide N termini, and acetyl modification of protein N terminus. A target-decoy database search was used to set a false-discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. The reporter ion integration tolerance was 0.5 Da. The coisolation threshold was 75%. The average signal-to-noise threshold of all reporter peaks was bigger than 10. The total intensity of a reporter ion for a protein was calculated based on the sum of all detected reporter ions of associated peptides from that protein. The ratios between reporter ions and the reference reporter ions (TMT6-130 or -131) were used to estimate the abundance ratio of each protein. For statistical analysis, the sum of reporter ion intensities for each protein was log2 transformed and the technical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only the proteins that were identified with at least one peptide detected in each technical replicate, and quantified in all three technical replicates, were considered for the analysis. Student’s t test was performed to identify proteins that are differentially expressed. Proteins with P values of <0.05 were further evaluated for increased or decreased abundance using a cutoff value of log2 fold change of >|1|.Data availability.
